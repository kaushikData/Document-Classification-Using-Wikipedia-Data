In [[biology]], '''altruism''' refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name="Bell2008"&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: The Mechanism of Evolution| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 0-19-856972-6| pages = 367–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altruism in this sense is different from the philosophical concept of altruism, in which an action would only be called "altruistic" if it was done with the conscious intention of helping another. In the behavioural sense, there is no such requirement. As such, it is not evaluated in moral terms—it is the consequences of an action for reproductive fitness that determine whether the action is considered altruistic, not the intentions, if any, with which the action is performed.&lt;ref name="Okasha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/|title=Biological altruism|author=Okasha, S.|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2008|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term altruism was coined by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as ''altruisme'', for an [[antonym]] of egoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teske|first1=Nathan|title=Political Activists in America: The Identity Construction Model of Political Participation|date=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=9780271035468|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7B38I2UEPa0C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived it from an Italian ''altrui'', which in turn was derived from Latin ''alteri'', meaning "other people" or "somebody else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ciciloni|first1=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neAGAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruistic behaviours appear most obviously in [[Kin selection|kin relationships]], such as in parenting, but may also be evident among wider social groups, such as in social insects. They allow an individual to increase the success of its genes by helping relatives that share those genes.&lt;ref name="DaviesKrebs2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas B. Davies|author2=John R. Krebs|author3=Stuart A. West|title=An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9mXO5asWi8C|date=April 9, 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-3949-9|pages=307–333|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obligate altruism is the permanent loss of direct fitness (with potential for indirect fitness gain). For example, honey bee workers may forage for the colony. Facultative altruism is temporary loss of direct fitness (with potential for indirect fitness gain followed by personal reproduction); for example, a [[Florida scrub jay]] helping at the nest, then gaining parental territory.&lt;ref&gt;{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR by John Alcock 9th edition}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of behavior), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], on occasion, some animals do behave in ways that reduce their individual fitness but increase the fitness of other individuals in the population; this is a functional definition of altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Robert L. Trivers]] | title = The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism | journal = [[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] | volume = 46 | issue = 1
 | year = 1971 | page = 35 | url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2822435?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101295513123 | doi = 10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in [[evolutionary theory]] has been applied to social behaviour, including altruism. Cases of animals helping individuals to whom they are closely related can be explained by [[kin selection]], and are not considered true altruism. Beyond the physical exertions that in some species mothers and in some species fathers undertake to protect their young, extreme examples of sacrifice may occur. One example is [[matriphagy]] (the consumption of the mother by her offspring) in the spider ''[[Stegodyphus]]''; another example is a male spider allowing a female fertilized by him to eat him. [[Hamilton's rule]] describes the benefit of such altruism in terms of [[Sewall Wright|Wright's]] [[coefficient of relationship]] to the beneficiary and the benefit granted to the beneficiary minus the cost to the sacrificer. Should this sum be greater than zero a fitness gain will result from the sacrifice.

When apparent altruism is not between kin, it may be based on [[reciprocal altruism|reciprocity]]. A monkey will present its back to another monkey, who will pick out parasites; after a time the roles will be reversed. Such reciprocity will pay off, in evolutionary terms, as long as the costs of helping are less than the benefits of being helped and as long as animals will not gain in the long run by "cheating"—that is to say, by receiving favours without returning them. This is elaborated on in [[evolutionary game theory]] and specifically the [[prisoner's dilemma]] as social theory.

==Implications in evolutionary theory==
[[Image:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|right| 250 px|Cooperative hunting by wolves allows them to tackle much larger and more nutritious prey than any individual wolf could handle. However, such cooperation could, potentially, be exploited by selfish individuals who do not expose themselves to the dangers of the hunt, but nevertheless share in the spoils.]]
The existence of altruism in nature is at first sight puzzling, because altruistic behaviour reduces the likelihood that an individual will reproduce. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The idea that ''[[group selection]]'' might explain the evolution of altruism was first broached by Darwin himself in [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]], (1871). The concept of group selection has had a chequered and controversial history in evolutionary biology but the uncritical 'good of the species' tradition came to an abrupt halt in the 1960s, due largely to the work of [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Williams (biologist)|Williams, G.C.]] (1972) [[Adaptation and Natural Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought]].

(2012). [http://edge.org/conversation/the-false-allure-of-group-selection The False Allure of Group Selection].  Edge,  Jun 19, 2012.  http://edge.org/conversation/the-false-allure-of-group-selection&lt;/ref&gt; These evolutionary theorists pointed out that [[natural selection]] acts on the individual, and that it is the individual's fitness (number of offspring and grand-offspring produced compared to the rest of the population) that drives evolution. A group advantage (e.g. hunting in a pack) that is disadvantageous to the individual (who might be harmed during the hunt, when it could avoid injury by hanging back from the pack but still share in the spoils) cannot evolve, because the selfish individual will leave, on average, more offspring than those who join the pack and suffer injuries as a result. If the selfishness is hereditary, this will ultimately result in the population consisting entirely of selfish individuals. However, in the 1960s and 1970s an alternative to the "group selection" theory emerged. This was the [[kin selection]] theory, due originally to [[W. D. Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1964 | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour, I and II. | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4| journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1–16, 17–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kin selection is an instance of [[inclusive fitness]], which is based on the notion that an individual shares only half its genes with each offspring, but also with each full [[Sib (anthropology)|sib]] (See footnote{{#tag:ref |An individual's gene complement (or genome) can be represented by the letters of the alphabet. Each letter is represented twice: A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The subscript indicates from which parent that copy of A has come. Mostly the two copies are identical, but occasionally they differ slightly.

When this individual reproduces sexually, one or other copy of A (chosen randomly) is passed on to offspring-1, who gets its other copy of A from the sexual partner. The same happens with genes B, C, D …. Z. If we denote the two sexual partners by means of  subscripts "m" and "f", then the genome of the offspring they produce might consist of A&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;/B&lt;sub&gt;f2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt; …… Z&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/Z&lt;sub&gt;f2&lt;/sub&gt;. Each parent has contributed exactly half of the offspring's genome. So individual "m" shares only half of its genome with its offspring.
Suppose individuals "m" and "f" produce a second offspring (offspring-2), whose genome is determined in exactly the same manner. For this example, suppose their genome consists of 52 genes. There is a coin-flip 50% probability that offspring-2 will inherit the same copy of A from "m" as offspring-1 did (i.e. A&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;). This also applies to gene B and so on through the alphabet. If a coin-flip "heads" means that gene X is the same in offspring-1 as it is in offspring-2, then in 26 flips of the coin, approximately half are going to be "heads", and the rest "tails", i.e. half the genes inherited from parent "m" will be the same in the two offspring. The same will happen to the genes inherited from parent "f". Thus of the 52 genes inherited from the two parents, on average, 13&amp;nbsp;+ &amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp;26 (or half) will be identical in the two sibs.
Thus sibs are genetically as similar to one another as a parent is to an offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. (1984) Natural selection, kin selection and group selection. In Krebs, J.R. &amp; Davies, N.B. (Eds.) ‘' Behavioural Ecology. An Evolutionary Approach.'' (p. 70-71).

From an evolutionary genetic point of view it is therefore as advantageous to help with the upbringing of full sibs as it is to produce and raise one's own offspring. The two activities are evolutionarily entirely equivalent. Co-operative breeding (i.e. helping one's parents raise sibs—provided they are full sibs) could thus evolve without the need for group-level selection. This  quickly gained prominence among biologists interested in the evolution of social behaviour.&lt;ref name="Okasha" /&gt;

In 1971 [[Robert Trivers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1086/406755|last=Trivers|first= R.L.|year=1971|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology| volume= 46|pages= 35–57|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced his [[reciprocal altruism]] theory to explain the evolution of helping at the nest of an unrelated breeding pair of birds. He argued that an individual might act as a helper if there was a high probabilistic expectation of being helped by the recipients at some later date. If, however, the recipients did not reciprocate when it was possible to do so, the altruistic interaction with these recipients would be permanently terminated. But if the recipients did not cheat then the reciprocal altruism would continue indefinitely to both parties' advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Emlen, S.T. (1984) Cooperative breeding in birds and mammals. In Krebs, J.R. &amp; Davies, N.B. (Eds.) " Behavioural Ecology. An Evolutionary Approach. " (pp. 328-329). Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications. {{ISBN|0632009985}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was considered by many (e.g. West-Eberhard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1086/408298|last=West Eberhard|first= M.J..|year=1975|title=The evolution of social behaviour by kin selection|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology| volume= 50|pages= 1–33|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dawkins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dawkins|first1 =R.|title=The Selfish Gene|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0192860925|pages=183–185|url= |chapter=You scratch my back, I'll ride on yours. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to be [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily unstable]] because it is prone to invasion by cheats for the same reason that cooperative hunting can be invaded and replaced by cheats. However, Trivers did make reference to the [[Prisoner's dilemma|Prisoner's Dilemma Game]] which, 10 years later, would restore interest in Trivers' reciprocal altruism theory, but under the title of "tit-for-tat".&lt;ref name=axelrod&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7466396|last1=Axelrod |first1=R.|last2=Hamilton|first2=W.D.|year = 1981 | title = The evolution of cooperation|url = | journal = Science |volume = 211 | issue =|pages = 1390–1396 |pmid =7466396|bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original form the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) described two awaiting trial prisoners, A and B, each faced with the choice of betraying the other or remaining silent. The "[[Game theory|game]]" has four possible outcomes: (a) they both betray each other, and are both sentenced to two years in prison; (b) A betrays B, which sets A free and B is sentenced to four years in prison; (c) B betrays A, with the same result as (b) except that it is B who is set free and the other spends four years in jail; (d) both remain silent, resulting in a six-month sentence each. Clearly (d) ("cooperation") is the best mutual strategy, but from the point of view of the individual betrayal is  unbeatable (resulting in being set free, or getting only a two-year sentence). Remaining silent results in a four-year or six-month sentence. This is exemplified by a further example of the PDG:  two strangers attend a restaurant together and decide to split the bill. The mutually best ploy would be for both parties to order the cheapest items on the menu (mutual cooperation). But if one member of the party exploits the situation by ordering the most expensive items, then it is best for the other member to do likewise. In fact, if the fellow diner's personality is completely unknown, and the two diners are unlikely ever to meet again, it is always in one's own best interests to eat as expensively as possible. Situations in nature that are subject to the same dynamics (rewards and penalties) as the PDG define cooperative behaviour: it is never in the individual's fitness interests to cooperate, even though mutual cooperation rewards the two contestants (together) more highly than any other strategy.&lt;ref name=sigmund&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sigmund|first1 =K.|title=Games of Life.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=|pages=180–206|url= |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation cannot evolve under these circumstances.

However, in 1981 Axelrod and Hamilton&lt;ref name=axelrod /&gt; noted that if the same contestants in the PDG meet repeatedly (the so-called Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game, IPD) then tit-for-tat (foreshadowed by Robert Triver's reciprocal altruism theory) is a robust strategy which promotes altruism.&lt;ref name=axelrod /&gt;&lt;ref name=sigmund /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1 =J.|title=Evolutionary Genetics|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198542151|pages=168–169, 181–183|url= |chapter=Evolution in structured populations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "tit-for-tat" both players' opening moves are cooperation. Thereafter each contestant repeats the other player's last move, resulting in a seemingly endless sequence of mutually cooperative moves. However, mistakes severely undermine tit-for-tat's effectiveness, giving rise to prolonged sequences of betrayal, which can only be rectified by another mistake. Since these initial discoveries, all the other possible IPD game strategies have been identified (16 possibilities in all, including, for instance, "generous tit-for-tat", which behaves like "tit-for-tat", except that it cooperates with a small probability when the opponent's last move was "betray".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Godfray, H.C.J. | title = The evolution of forgiveness | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue =  |date=1992 | pages = 206–207 | doi =  10.1038/355206a0| pmid =|bibcode = 1992Natur.355..206G }}&lt;/ref&gt;), but all can be outperformed by at least one of the other strategies, should one of the players switch to such a strategy. The result is that none is [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]], and any prolonged series of the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, in which alternative strategies arise at random, gives rise to a chaotic sequence of strategy changes that never ends.&lt;ref name=sigmund /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1073/pnas.90.11.5091|last1 = Novak |first1=M.|last2=Sigmund|first2=K.|year = 1993 |title = Chaos and the evolution of cooperation |url = | journal =Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume =90 |issue =|pages = 5091–5094 |pmid =|bibcode =1993PNAS...90.5091N|pmc =46660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=koeslag1&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1006/jtbi.1997.0496|last1 = Koeslag|first1 = J.H.| year = 1997 |title = Sex, the Prisoner's Dilemma Game, and the evolutionary inevitability of cooperation |url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology| volume = 189 |issue = | pages = 53–61 |pmid =9398503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the light of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game failing to provide a full answer to the evolution of cooperation or altruism, several alternative explanations have been proposed.

There are striking parallels between altruistic acts and exaggerated [[Sexual selection|sexual ornaments]] displayed by some animals, particularly certain bird species, such as, amongst others, the [[Peafowl|peacock]]. Both are costly in fitness terms, and both are generally conspicuous to other members of the population or species. This led [[Amotz Zahavi]] to suggest that both might be [[Signalling theory|fitness signals]] rendered evolutionarily stable by his [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1975 |title=Mate selection—a selection for a handicap |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=205–214 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3 |pmid=1195756}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zahavi&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1977 |title=The cost of honesty (Further remarks on the handicap principle) |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=603–605 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(77)90061-3 |pmid=904334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1997 |title=The handicap principle: a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-510035-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a signal is to remain reliable, and generally resistant to falsification, [[Signalling theory#The sports handicapping metaphor|the signal]] has to be evolutionarily costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grafen |first=A. |year=1990 |title=Biological signals as handicaps |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=144 |issue=4 |pages=517–546 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80088-8 |pmid=2402153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if a (low fitness) liar were to use the highly costly signal, which seriously eroded its real fitness, it would find it difficult to maintain a semblance or normality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=RA |first2=A |last2=Grafen |year=1993 |title=Dishonesty and the handicap principle |journal=Anim.

These systems are aimed at reducing disparities in performance, thereby making the outcome of contests less predictable. In a horse [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap race]], provenly faster horses are given heavier weights to carry under their saddles than inherently slower horses. Similarly, in [[Golf handicap|amateur golf]], better golfers have fewer strokes subtracted from their raw scores than the less talented players. The handicap therefore correlates with unhandicapped performance, making it possible, if one knows nothing about the horses, to predict which unhandicapped horse would win an open race. It would be the one handicapped with the greatest weight in the saddle. The handicaps in nature are highly visible, and therefore a peahen, for instance, would be able to deduce the health of a potential mate by comparing its handicap (the size of the peacock's tail) with those of the other males. The loss of the male's fitness caused by the handicap is offset by its increased access to females, which is as much of a fitness concern as is its health. An altruistic act is, by definition, similarly costly. It would therefore also signal fitness, and is probably as attractive to females as a physical handicap. If this is the case altruism is evolutionarily stabilized by [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name=zahavi /&gt;

There is an alternate strategy for identifying fit mates which does not rely on one gender having exaggerated sexual ornaments or other handicaps, but is generally applicable to most, if not all sexual creatures. It derives from the concept that the change in appearance and functionality caused by a [[Silent mutation|non-silent]] [[mutation]] will generally stand out in a population. This is because that altered appearance and functionality will be unusual, peculiar, and different from the norm within that population. The norm against which these unusual features are judged is made up of fit attributes that have attained their plurality through [[natural selection]], while less adaptive attributes will be in the minority or frankly rare.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;Fisher R. (1930) ''The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the overwhelming majority of mutant features are maladaptive, and it is impossible to predict evolution's future direction, sexual creatures would be expected to [[Koinophilia|prefer mates with the least number of unusual or minority features]].&lt;ref name=fisher /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D.

Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species, its entire repertoire of behaviours will also be rendered [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]], including any altruistic, cooperative and social characteristics.

== Reciprocity mechanisms ==
Altruism in animals describes a range of behaviors performed by animals that may be to their own disadvantage but which benefit others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/altruism |title=Altruism &amp;#124; Define Altruism at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs and benefits are measured in terms of reproductive fitness, or expected number of offspring. So by behaving altruistically, an organism reduces the number of offspring it is likely to produce itself, but boosts the likelihood that other organisms are to produce offspring. There are other forms of altruism in nature other than risk-taking behavior, such as reciprocal altruism. This biological notion of altruism is not identical to the everyday human concept. For humans, an action would only be called 'altruistic' if it was done with the conscious intention of helping another. Yet in the biological sense there is no such requirement. Instead, until we can communicate directly with other species, an accurate theory to describe altruistic acts between species is Biological Market Theory.
Humans and other animals exchange benefits in several ways, known technically as reciprocity mechanism. No matter what the mechanism, the common thread is that benefits find their way back to the original giver.

=== Symmetry-based ===
Also known as the "buddy-system", mutual affection between two parties prompts similar behavior in both directions without need to track of daily give-and-take, so long as the overall relationship remains satisfactory. This is one of the most common mechanism of reciprocity in nature, this kind is present in humans, primates, and many other mammals.

=== Attitudinal ===
Also known as, "If you're nice, I'll be nice too." This mechanism of reciprocity is similar to the heuristic of the golden rule, "Treat others how you would like to be treated." Parties mirror one another's attitudes, exchanging favors on the spot. Instant attitudinal reciprocity occurs among monkeys, and people often rely on it with strangers and acquaintances.

=== Calculated ===
Also known as, "what have you done for me lately?" Individuals keep track of the benefits they exchange with particular partners, which helps them decide to whom to return favors. This mechanism is typical of chimpanzees and very common among human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;DeWaal, F. B. M. 2005. "How animals do business." ??(?) ''Scientific American''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet some opposing experimental research suggests that calculated or contingent reciprocity does not spontaneously arise in laboratory experimental settings, despite patterns of behavior.

== Biological market theory ==
Biological market theory is an extension of the idea of reciprocal altruism, as a mechanism to explain altruistic acts between unrelated individuals in a more flexible system of exchanging commodities. The term 'biological market' was first used by Ronald Noe and Hammerstein in 1994 to refer to all the interactions between organisms in which different organisms function as 'traders' that exchange goods and services such as food and water, grooming, warning calls, shelter, etc. Biological market theory consists of five formal characteristics which present a basis for altruism.

# Commodities are exchanged between individuals that differ in the degree of control over those commodities.
# Trading partners are chosen from a number of potential partners.
# There is competition among the members of the chosen class to be the most attractive partner. This competition by 'outbidding' causes an increase in the value of the commodity offered.
# Supply and demand determine the bartering value of commodities exchanged.
# Commodities on offer can be advertised. As in commercial advertisements there is a potential for false information.&lt;ref&gt;Noë, R., &amp; Voelkl, B. (2013). "Cooperation and biological markets: The power of partner choice". In K. Sterelny, R. Joyce, B. Calcott, B. Fraser (Eds.), ''Cooperation and its evolution'' (pp. 131–151). Cambridge, MA US: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicability of biological market theory with its emphasis on partner choice is evident in the interactions between the [[cleaner wrasse]] and its "client" [[reef fish]]. [[Cleaner fish|Cleaners]] have small territories, which the majority of reef fish species actively visit to invite inspection of their surface, gills, and mouth. Clients benefit from the removal of [[Fish diseases and parasites|parasites]] while cleaners benefit from the access to a food source. Some particularly choosy client species have large home ranges that cover several [[cleaning station]]s, whereas other clients have small ranges and have access to one cleaning station only (resident clients). Field observations, field manipulations, and laboratory experiments revealed that whether or not a client has choice options influences several aspects of both cleaner and client behaviour. Cleaners give choosy clients priority of access. Choosy clients switch partners if cheated by a cleaner by taking a bite of out of the cleaner, whereas resident clients punish cheats. Cleaners and resident clients, but not choosy clients, build up relationships before normal cleaning interactions take place. Cleaners are particularly cooperative if choosy clients are bystanders of an interaction but less so when resident clients are bystanders.&lt;ref&gt;Bshary, R., &amp; Noë, R. (2003).

Researchers tested whether wild white-handed [[gibbon]] males from [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand, increased their grooming activity when the female partner was fertile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barelii|first1=C|last2=Reichard|first2=U|last3=Mundry|first3=R|title=Is grooming used as a commodity in wild white-handed gibbons, Hylobates lar?|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2011|volume=82|issue=4|pages=801–809|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.07.012}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Adult females and males of our study population are codominant (in terms of aggression), they live in pairs or small multi male groups and mate promiscuously. They found that males groomed females more than vice versa and more grooming was exchanged when females were cycling than during pregnancy or lactation. The number of copulations/day was elevated when females were cycling, and females copulated more frequently with males on days when they received more grooming. When males increased their grooming efforts, females also increased their grooming of males, perhaps to equalize give and take. Although grooming might be reciprocated because of intrinsic benefits of receiving grooming, males also interchange grooming as a commodity for sexual opportunities during a female's fertile period.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

These protists live as individual [[amoeba]]e until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.&lt;ref name="Reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/altruism|title=Altruism|publisher=Reference.com|accessdate=July 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108211148/http://www.reference.com/browse/altruism|archive-date=November 8, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anubandha chatushtaya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अनुबन्ध चतुष्टय) literally means four connections, and therefore, it is four-fold in nature and content viz, – a) ''adhikāri'' ('the qualified student') who has developed ''[[Ekagrata|ekāgrata]]'' ('single pointed mind'), ''chitta shuddhi'' ('purity of the mind') and ''[[Vikṣepa|vikshepa]]'' ('freedom from restlessness and impurity') or ''adhikāra'' (''aptitude''); b) ''vishaya'' ('subject matter' or 'the theme') pertaining to the '' [[Jiva]]-[[Brahman]] identity''; c) ''[[prayojana]]'' or '' phalasruti'' ('result' or 'fruit') which is ''atyantika-dukha-nivritti'' ('complete cessation of sorrow') and ''paramānanda-prāpti'' ('attainment of supreme happiness'), and d) ''[[sambandha]]'' ('relationship' or 'intertextuality') between ''adhikāra'', ''vishaya'' and ''prayojana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aldous Huxley and Indian Thought|publisher=Sterling Publishers|page=16|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EK3E6epYXmEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Anubandha+chatushtaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qZSjVPaOB9DUuQS204LwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Anubandha%20chatushtaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

[[Sadananda (of Vedantasara)|Sadananda]] reminds that:-

:तत्र अनुबन्धो नाम अधिकारिविषयसंबन्धप्रयोजनानि |

: "The preliminary questions of the Vedanta are the determination of the competency of the student, the subject-matter, its connection with the book and the necessity of for its study." – [[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)|Vedantasara]] (sutra I.5)

a)- ''Adhikāra'' is the capacity to study (''adhyana'') the subject-matter in which respect there exist doubts (''sandigdhata'') which is the basis of the intended inquiry into that particular subject-matter for the eventual removal of all doubts and gain of its proper understanding. [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]] speaks about three levels of ''adhikāra'' – ''adhama'' ('lower'), ''madhyma'' ('middle') and ''uttama'' ('higher'), the last two levels indicate that the student is of peaceful mind (''śanta''), is understanding and has non-repressed sense-control (''danta''), has withdrawn from worldly objects (''uparata''), indifferent (''titikśu'') and composed and tranquil (''samhita''), and knows that he is adequately prepared to meet the truth face to face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Living Traditions in Contemporary Contexts|author=Vasudeva Rao|publisher=Orient Blackswan|pages=|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-utNEpTZWUkC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=adhikara&amp;hadhyal=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7pijVJnRBMWiugSHzIDYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikara&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimāmsikas]] consider ''adhikāra'' to be a notion of appropriateness. All things and actions have identifiable ''adhikāra''. ''Adhikāra'' indicates the level of preparation necessary for making one skilled for higher gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Myths and Philosophy|publisher=SUNY Press|page=304|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XdHPgPmSgYEC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=adhikara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aZijVMWYIYWxuASk_ILACQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikara&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''adhikāra'' also helps describe the relationship between ''[[purusha]]'' and ''[[Prakṛti|prakrti]]'' and explain the reason for activation of creative power of nature, and thus brings about the experience of the world (''darśana bhoga'') and liberation from this experience (''[[kaivalya]]''). The eagerness to know incites the obligation (''adhikāra'') to bring about realization of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Release from Life, Release in Life|publisher=Peter Lang|page=138,149|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HkzZMN3HA7kC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=adhikara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7pijVJnRBMWiugSHzIDYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikara&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this direction the student must firstly develop '' [[Ekagrata|Ekāgratā]] '' ('one-pointed'). ''Ekagrata'' is the state of determined and continuous concentration obtained by integrating the psycho-mental flux (''sarvārthatā'' i.e. variously directed, discontinuous, diffused attention) which is – योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ([[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutra]])- meaning – [[Yoga]] is suppression of psycho-mental states i.e. disappearance of all possible misconceptions. In this yogic state of ''ekagrata'' the yogi gains genuine will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Medicine Men to Muhammad|author=Mercia Eliade|publisher=Harper and Row|page=73|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sY0uH75vwW8C&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tcT5UvCwIo-ThQfksIGQDw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBzgU%20%7d%7d%3c/ref }}&lt;/ref&gt; '' [[Upasana]] '' brings about ''ekagrata'', and ''upasana'' in its own turn is brought about by ''chitta shuddhi'' ('the purity of heart');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moksha|publisher=Sivanandaonline.org|url= http://sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=1513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and controls '' [[Vikṣepa|vikshepa]] '' (all forms of mental wanderings or distractions).

In [[Sanskrit grammar]], an ''adhikara'' is a 'heading rule' made belonging to it, by the accent of ''swarita'' with the object of avoiding a repeated designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Panini: His Place in Sanskrit Literature|author=Theodor Goldstucker|publisher=N.Trubner &amp; Co.|pages=47–49|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zQ0dhaI-rNAC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=adhikara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aZijVMWYIYWxuASk_ILACQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikara&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

b)- ''Vishaya'' is the object of knowledge, here the subject-matter; the universal Self ([[Brahman]]) seemingly different from the individual self ([[Jiva]]). Knowledge reveals the real to be superimposed by the unreal on account of ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Comparative History of the World Philosophy|author=Ben Ami-Scharfstein|publisher=SUNY Press|page=372|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1xXJBZLn04IC&amp;pg=PA372&amp;dq=vishaya+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6a6jVKCSCJSBuwTZn4KgCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vishaya%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by [[Sadananda (of Vedantasara)|Sadananda]] the subject is the one-ness of the individual soul and the universal soul (the Absolute) as explained by the [[Upanishads]]; this is the essence of the [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimad Bhagavad Gita|publisher=iUniverse|page=287|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-eDEdkKRtJMC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=vishaya+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6a6jVKCSCJSBuwTZn4KgCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vishaya%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consciousness, which is infinite and indivisible, is able to come into contact with objects and is inherent in objects which are thus very many varying phases of consciousness; such objects that are by themselves phases of consciousness are ''vishaya-caitanya'', outside consciousness no object can exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from Rig Veda|author=C.S.Moorthy|publisher=Authorhouse|page=|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kv86C_pd5-YC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=vishaya+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yK-jVLn6FI7-ugTwl4D4Aw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vishaya%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

c)- ''[[Prayojana]]'' means - the 'purpose', 'end result' or 'resolution of the inquiry'; it is the established result arrived at after practice of devotion conducted with a peaceful mind and body (''śanta bhāva'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Final Word|author=Tony K. Stewart|publisher=Oxford University Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ue8CTho9_5kC&amp;pg=PR118&amp;dq=prayojana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=crCjVIeeNIe8uATNsILICQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayojana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Uddyotakara explains that the basic urges for attainment of happiness and avoidance of sorrow, such as the ''chaturvarga'' composed of ''[[dharma]]'', ''[[artha]]'', ''[[kama]]'' and ''[[moksha]]'', prompt human activity, and which motivation leads to the end results or ''prayojana''. Vedānta Paribhāśa, recognizing this ''chaturvarga'' describes ''prayojana'' as that which when known is desired as one’s own,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Knowledge and Freedom in Indian Philosophy|author=Tara Chatterjea|publisher=Lexington Books|page=90|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=djc1ZvyuQREC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=prayojana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KrGjVN-3FoeIuAT514KgDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayojana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prayojana is the realizable purpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sastrarambha|publisher=Otto Harrassaowitz Verlag|page=ix|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fD0Ypvxmzj8C&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=prayojana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=crCjVIeeNIe8uATNsILICQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayojana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; the desired reason or motive which prompts actions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=desire and Motivation in Indian Philosophy|author=Christopher g.

d)- ''Sambandha'' does not necessarily identify either ''vishaya'' or ''prayojana'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Dvaita School of Vedanta|author=B.N.Krishnamurti Sharma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=58|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FVtpFMPMulcC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=sambandha+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=urGjVKO7MMSGuAT6qIGICg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sambandha%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it can be factual and reasonable (''siddha'') or contrary to fact and reason (''asiddha''). [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] tells us that the self is bodyless (''aśarira'') but its relationship (''sambandha'') with the body is ''[[Asiddhatva|asiddha]]'' because the self is unrelated to any activity of the body and unconnected with merit and demerit arising from activity notwithstanding the fact that the ''jiva'' erroneously identifies itself with the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sankar’s Advaita Vedanta|author=shyama Kumar Chattopadhyaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=369|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA357&amp;dq=sambandha+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=urGjVKO7MMSGuAT6qIGICg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sambandha%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vedantasara afore-cited statement as an exposition of these four ''anubandhas'' ('connections') and in particular the connection called ''sambandha'' to mean – (quote) "the relation of what has to be made known in the Vedantic system, the identity between Brahman and the individual soul" (unquote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Tantric Philosophy|publisher=Routledge|page=72|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kkXJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=sambandha+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=drKjVM7BBcKVuATQrYDICg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sambandha%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==

In [[Hindu philosophy]], ''Anubandha chatushtaya'' is a traditional Indian rhetorical mode connected with the gain of knowledge and supreme perfection, which mode is based on four fundamental aspects of thoughts and actions working in-tandem which are – a) the proposed subject or theme, b) the intended goal and its nature, c) why for that goal is sought in the light of d) the subject opted and the anticipated apprehension of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poet Saints of India|author=Sumit Roy|publisher=Sterling Publishers|pages=|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zMvlDsnEgRoC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Anubandha+chatushtaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qZSjVPaOB9DUuQS204LwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Anubandha%20chatushtaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krishna]] assures [[Arjuna]]:-

:परं भूयः प्रवक्ष्यामि ज्ञानानां ज्ञानमुत्तमम् |
:यज्ज्ञात्वा मुनयः सर्वे परां सिद्धिमितो गताः ||

: "I shall again speak of that highest knowledge which is superior to any other knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained the supreme perfection."  [[Bhagavad Gita]] (XIV.1)

and thereafter, proceeds to explain how that knowledge can be gained and developed which would eventually free a ''mumukshu'' ('seeker') who due to association with the modes of nature (''prakrti'') is entangled in this material world, and therefore, explains the nature of the three '' [[guna]]s''. This particular statement is in the form of an ''Anubandha chatushtaya'' the subject-matter of which is ''Brahma Vidya'', the goal is liberation from sorrow, and ''pryojanam'' is the knowledge of Brahman which gives spontaneous release. Krishna leads Arjuna to that knowledge of the self which reveals what the subject is, what the "I" is – '' [[Tat Tvam Asi]] '', this is the relationship that helps the seeker, possessing basic qualities, to decide whether he should connect or associate with the subject-matter or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journey Through the Bhagavad Gita|author=G.K.Marballi|publisher=Lulu.com|page=489|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-fQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA489&amp;dq=Anubandha+chatushtaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qZSjVPaOB9DUuQS204LwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Anubandha%20chatushtaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bellum omnium contra omnes.png|thumb|The ''Præfatio'' (Preface) of ''De Cive'' where the phrase ''bellum omnium contra omnes'' appears for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=22dEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA11-IA16&amp;dq=%22bellum+o-mnium+contra+omnes%22 See] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Taken from the revised edition printed in 1647 at Amsterdam (''apud L. Elzevirium'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=22dEAAAAcAAJ See] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''{{lang|la|Bellum omnium contra omnes}}''''', a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase meaning "the war of all against all", is the description that [[Thomas Hobbes]] gives to [[Human condition|human existence]] in the [[state of nature]] [[thought experiment]] that he conducts in ''[[De Cive]]'' (1642) and ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651). The common modern English usage is a war of "each against all" where war is rare and terms such as "competition" or "struggle" are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/71/0425.html|title=Each Against All|author=[[Charles Fourier]]|editor=[[Upton Sinclair]]| year=1915|edition=1st |work=[[Bartleby.com]]|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hobbes' use==
In [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']] itself,&lt;ref name=Lv &gt;{{cite book|title=Leviathan |author=[[Thomas Hobbes]] |editor-first = Hermann |editor-last =Klenner |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KJJ1HkxT_hoC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Meiner Verlag |location=[[Hamburg]] |year=2005 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=KJJ1HkxT_hoC&amp;pg=610&amp;dq=%22a+warre,+as+is+of+every+man,+against+every+man%22+%22a+perpetuall+warre+of+every+man+against+his+neighbour%22+%22bellum+omnium+in+omnes%22+%22bellum+omnium+contra+omnes%22 610] |isbn=978-3-787-31699-1| id={{ISBN|3-78731699-X}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] speaks of 'warre of every one against every one',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=BPtdfEZ2iDcC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=%22Warre+of+every+one+against+every+one%22 Chapter 14].&lt;/ref&gt; of 'a war [...] of every man against every man'&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=BPtdfEZ2iDcC&amp;q=%22of+every+man+against+every+man%22 Chapters 13-14].&lt;/ref&gt; and of 'a perpetuall warre of every man against his neighbour',&lt;ref name=Lv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=BPtdfEZ2iDcC&amp;q=%22a+perpetuall+warre+of+every+man+against+his+neighbour%22 Chapter 24].&lt;/ref&gt; but the Latin phrase occurs in ''[[De Cive]]'':
{{Quote|[...] ''ostendo primo conditionem hominum extra societatem civilem, quam conditionem appellare liceat statum naturæ, aliam non esse quam bellum omnium contra omnes; atque in eo bello jus esse omnibus in omnia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} [https://books.google.com/?id=YcyX3dTKfBIC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22ostendo+primo+conditionem+hominum+extra+societatem+civilem,+quam+conditionem+appellare+liceat+statum+naturae,+aliam+non+esse+quam+bellum+omnium+contra+omnes+;+atque+in+eo+bello+jus+esse+omnibus+in+omnia%22 ''Præefatio'' ("Preface")].&lt;/ref&gt;

I demonstrate, in the first place, that the state of men without civil society (which state we may properly call the state of nature) is nothing else but a mere war of all against all; and in that war all men have equal right unto all things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22I+demonstrate+in+the+first+place,+that+the+state+of+men+without+civil+society+(which+state+we+may+properly+call+the+state+of+nature)+is+nothing+else+but+a+mere+war+of+all+against+all;+and+in+that+war+all+men+have+equal+right+unto+all+things%22 English translation] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later on, two slightly modified versions are presented in [[De Cive|''Libertas'' (liberty)]]:
{{Quote|[...] ''Status hominum naturalis antequam in societatem coiretur, bellum fuerit; neque hoc simpliciter, sed bellum omnium in omnes.''&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} [https://books.google.com/?id=YcyX3dTKfBIC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22status+hominum+naturalis+antequam+in+societatem+coiretur,+bellum+fuerit;+neque+hoc+simpliciter,+sed+bellum+omnium%22%22in+omnes%22 Chapter 1, section 12].&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter XIII of ''Leviathan'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html |title=Chapter XIII - Of the Natural Condition of Mankind as Concerning Their Felicity and Misery |author=Thomas Hobbes |date= |work=bartleby.com |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes explains the concept with these words:
{{Quote|Hereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called War; and such a war as is of every man against every man.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22%22Hereby+it+is+manifest+that+during+the+time+men+live+without+a+common+Power+to+keep+them+all+in+awe,+they+are+in+that+condition+which+is+called+War;+and+such+a+war+as+is+of+every+man+against+every+man%22 Occurrences] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [...] In such condition there is no place for Industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual Fear, and danger of violent death; And the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22%22In+such+condition+there+is+no+place+for+Industry,+because+the+fruit+thereof+is+uncertain:+and+consequently+no+Culture+of+the+Earth;+no+Navigation,+nor+use+of+the+commodities+that+may+be+imported+by+Sea;+no+commodious+Building;+no+Instruments+of+moving+and+removing+such+things+as+require+much+force;+no+Knowledge+of+the+face+of+the+Earth;+no+account+of+Time;+no+Arts;+no+Letters;+no+Society;+and+which+is+worst+of+all,+continual+Fear,+and+danger+of+violent+death;+And+the+life+of+man+solitary,+poor,+nasty,+brutish,+and+short%22 ''Ibid.'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The thought experiment places people in a pre-social condition, and theorizes what would happen in such a condition. According to Hobbes, the outcome is that people choose to enter a [[social contract]], giving up some of their liberties in order to enjoy peace. This thought experiment is a test for the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimation]] of a [[Sovereign state|state]] in fulfilling its role as "[[sovereignty|sovereign]]" to guarantee social order, and for comparing different types of states on that basis.

Hobbes distinguishes between war and battle: war does not only consist of actual battle; it points to the situation in which one knows there is a 'Will to contend by Battle'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22+Leviathan+%22Will+to+contend+by+Battle%22 ''Ibid.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later uses==
In his ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1785) [[Thomas Jefferson]] uses the phrase ''bellum omnium in omnia'' ("war of all things against all things," assuming ''omnium'' is intended to be neuter like ''omnia'') as he laments that the constitution of that state was twice at risk of being sacrificed to the nomination of a [[dictator]] after the manner of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Notes on the State of Virginia|author=[[Thomas Jefferson]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FlEVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | publisher=Lilly and Wait | location=Boston| year=1832|page=[https://books.google.com/?id=FlEVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22ad+libitum+into+any+other+form+of+government+for+precedents+to+rule+us+by,+for+what+oppression+may+not+a+precedent+be+found+in+this+world+of+the+bellum+omnium+in+omnia?%22 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Betty Gram Swing,''' born '''Myrtle Eveline Gram''' (March 16, 1893 – September 1, 1969), was an American militant [[suffragist]].
==Personal life==
Betty Gram participated in landmark events of the women's rights movement in the early to mid-twentieth century. She joined the women’s rights movement in 1917 and was subsequently jailed five times and went on two hunger strikes. When she was sent to [[Tennessee]] to push for the last vote needed to ratify the [[19th Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment]], a local newspaper announced, “110 Pounds of Femininity Hit Memphis”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brandeis University: Women's Studies Research Center|title=My Militant Suffragette Grandmother, Betty Gram|url=http://calendar.boston.com/waltham_ma/events/show/351880303-my-militant-suffragette-grandmother-betty-gram|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary newspaper accounts often noted her attractiveness. She remained active for many decades in women’s rights and other causes.&lt;ref name=calendar_boston&gt;{{cite news|title=My Militant Suffragette Grandmother, Betty Gram|url=http://calendar.boston.com/waltham_ma/events/show/351880303-my-militant-suffragette-grandmother-betty-gram|accessdate=26 November 2013 | work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1921, Gram married well-known radio commentator [[Raymond Gram Swing]]. She insisted that he take her last name as well if she was taking his and became Betty Gram Swing. The couple were the parents of two sons and a daughter. They divorced in 1944.&lt;ref name=raymond_gram_swing&gt;{{cite web|title=Raymond Gram Swing|url=http://www.otr.com/swing.html|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suffrage Activity, 1917-1919==

After graduating from the University of Oregon, Betty Gram embarked on a stage career, which she left when she came east to join the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), led by [[Alice Paul]]. The NWP had split with other women's suffrage groups over its focus on a constitutional amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote, as well as on its aggressive tactics. Other groups, namely the [[National American Woman's Suffrage Association]], had built a state by state suffrage strategy and opposed the NWP's targeting of President Wilson and Democrats as well as its picketing effort.&lt;ref&gt;Jailed for Freedom, Doris Stevens&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Woman's Party began its picketing of the White House in January 1917.  In March of that year, over one thousand women took part. By June, the White House decided to arrest the picketers.  Since holding signs is not illegal, the women demanded to know the reason for their arrest. The eventual charge was obstructing traffic. Those charges were dismissed and no trial was held. But a new pattern had begun - the women picketers were not deterred. Upon their release, they went straight back to picketing the White House and were arrested again. A front page photo in the Evening Tribune of San Diego bore the caption, "Washington has found that the only way to keep a picket away from the White House is to put her in jail."&lt;ref&gt;Evening Tribune, San Diego, November 24, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;  This time the picketers were found guilty of obstructing traffic and fined $25 or 3 days in jail. The women refused to pay the fine. A rapid escalation followed until the leader of the NWP, [[Alice Paul]] was sentenced to 7 months in jail. Betty and her sister, Alice Gram, and 39 others were jailed for obstructing traffic on November 10, 1917; that picket was part of a protest of Alice Paul's sentence. The charge of obstructing traffic was widely understood as a sham - the Oregonian newspaper clearly stated as much in an article covering the Gram sisters' arrest.&lt;ref name="The Oregonian, November 15, 1917"&gt;The Oregonian, November 15, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article, Betty was quoted as saying, "I am going to prison for the suffrage case, with the full knowledge that I have committed no offense."&lt;ref name="The Oregonian, November 15, 1917"/&gt;  

Instead of being sent to the local jail, the November 10th picketers were sent to the [[Lorton Reformatory|Occoquan Workhouse]] in Virginia, where the inmates were forced to do prison labor. Horrible conditions faced the women in the workhouse - they were beaten, kept in isolation, and given rancid food. After being refused recognition as political prisoners, the women declared a [[hunger strike]]. The leaders of the NWP, including Alice Paul, were force fed.  The Gram sisters were released after 17 days in jail, along with 22 other hunger strikers, although they had been sentenced to 30 days.&lt;ref name=Kappa_Alpha_Theta_Magazine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Mary Edith Estes|title=Jailed for the Freedom to Vote|journal=The Kappa Alpha Theta Magazine|year=2008|issue=Autumn|page=12|url=http://issuu.com/theta/docs/autumn_2008_magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrests and hunger strike were widely covered in newspapers across the country and Betty was featured prominently.  The Oregonian noted that, by the time they were released, Betty and Alice had lost 12 and 19&amp;nbsp;lbs respectively.&lt;ref&gt;The Oregonian, November 24, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;  But their arrests and ill-treatment did not deter the Grams or the other picketers, who continue pressuring President Wilson and Congress to take up a constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote.  In January 1919, Betty Gram was one of two sentries outside the White House standing guard over a bonfire in which they burned President Wilson's speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Miami District Daily News, January 10, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;  The next month she was arrested in Boston when 21 members of the National Woman's Party gathered in front of the State House with suffrage banners.  They were there to protest President Wilson's arrival in Boston.  The women were arrested when they refused to comply with police orders to move.  In newspaper accounts, Betty was singled out as resisting arrest and had to be "lifted bodily" into the police wagon.&lt;ref&gt;Salt Lake Telegram (AP story), February 24, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratification Efforts==
After multiple attempts through 1918 and the beginning of 1919, on June 4, 1919, Congress finally passed the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] granting women the right to vote, pending ratification by the states. Betty Gram and the National Woman's Party quickly shifted their efforts from the White House to the states.  Betty became a leader in the ratification campaign, working in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Delaware, West Virginia, Tennessee, and other states. In January 1920, suffragists defeated a New Jersey referendum movement that would have put the question of ratification directly to voters.&lt;ref&gt;Trenton Evening Times, January 1, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  Delaware became an important battleground state, with an active anti-suffrage movement.  According to the Boston Herald, the NWP sent its "most experienced ratification campaigners" there, including Betty Gram.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Herald, March 15, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 1920, suffragists picketed the Republican National Convention in Chicago, hoping to pressure the Republican legislature of Delaware and Republican governors of Connecticut and Vermont for their failure to ratify the amendment.  The Cleveland Plain Dealer, covering the convention, described Betty Gram as "young, vivacious, and pretty" and referenced the miniature steel jail door she wore as a breast pin, symbolizing her time in jail for the cause of women's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland Plain Dealer, June 9, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  The NWP did not picket the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco.

In July 1920, Betty Gram was on her way to Tennessee to capture the 36th, and last, state needed for ratification.  Her hometown paper, the Oregonian, interviewed her on her work to get women the right to vote. Betty said, "I joined the picket group because I realized suffrage was at a standstill and unless something dramatic was done, nothing could be accomplished.".&lt;ref&gt;The Oregonian, July 9, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution. The long battle was won.

==Post-Suffrage==
Having finally succeeded in their years-long effort, the National Woman's Party and other women's groups had to reconsider the makeup and mission of their organizations.   In addition, the NWP lost some members as women focused on their careers or other causes.  Still others "found that marriage and family responsibilities at least temporarily curtailed their NWP activities."&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Susan. The Origins of the Equal Rights Amendment&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the ratification of the 19th amendment, Betty Gram set off for Europe to resume her music studies. After marrying Raymond Swing in 1921, her husband's career as a radio commentator and foreign correspondent took them to England, where they lived for over a decade. Now Betty Gram Swing, Betty continued her work for women's rights in the UK and in the international arena.

===A Rift===
Even with the right to vote, there were many other barriers to the full participation of women in business and society. The NWP, the [[League of Women Voters]], the Business and Professional Women, the [[Women's Trade Union League]] and other groups all worked to improve women's lives, but they had very different philosophies and approaches. The NWP faction are referred to as "equalitarian feminists", because they adopted a platform of equal rights for women, as opposed to the "social feminists" who supported a broader set of humanitarian social reforms, including child labor laws and protectionist legislation such as limiting a woman's work week, prohibiting night work for women, and a minimum wage for women and children. There were other legal issues facing women as well, such as the right to serve on a jury, equal rights of inheritance and property ownership, and questions of a married woman's citizenship independent of her husband's.  However, like the fight for suffrage, much disagreement remained among the various feminist groups as to the best way to achieve economic opportunity or economic independence for women.  
An essential element of this rift concerned employment rights for married women, specifically labor laws protecting women versus NWP's “equality” argument.  The NWP was against protectionist legislation, arguing it hurt women in the workplace by causing employers not to hire them.  As historian Susan Becker describes the feminist movement in the 1920s and 1930s the NWP "stood alone throughout these two decades in its single-minded dedication to obtaining legal equality between men and women." &lt;ref&gt;Becker, Susan, Origins of the Equal Rights Amendment&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equal Rights==
In 1926, Betty Gram Swing, along with two other American members of the NWP, formed an English outpost of the group in order to aid British feminists in their efforts to repeal the laws limiting women's voting rights to women over the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;Seattle Daily Times, December 7, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; Having also fought (and picketed) for equal pay for women and married women's employment rights during her years in England, Betty Gram Swing returned to the United States in 1934. In the fall of that year, she gave a speech to the Inter-American Commission of Woman at the Pan-American Union warning that women would lose their hard-earned rights unless they were ready to fight for them.  A Washington Post article covering the speech described Betty as one of "the youngest and most beautiful leaders in international feminism."&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, November 12, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; The article notes that Betty was focused at that time on having the [[Equal Rights Treaty]] "ratified and adhered to by all nations."

===Amendment and Treaty===
In the post-suffrage time period, American women's groups divided their attention between new legislative agendas, the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (either supporting or opposing it) and the growing focus on international women's issues, highlighted by the NWP's efforts to lobby for approval of the Equal Rights Treaty, which was modeled on the Equal Rights Amendment but was intended as an international document to be ratified by nations. In the 1930s both equalitarian and social feminist agendas were hampered by the Great Depression and the rise of fascism.

The NWP drafted the first version of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1921 and it provoked disputes almost immediately, even before it was introduced in Congress in 1923. It was addressed in Congressional subcommittees throughout the 1920s and 1930s but was not reported out until 1936. Hearings and committee reports followed into the 1940s, with the [[League of Women Voters]] and other social feminist groups consistently opposing it.  At the same time, the NWP was working internationally on the Treaty, which was presented to the Sixth Pan American conference in 1928 and, unofficially, at international talks in Paris. (With shades of their picketing days, Betty Gram Swing, NWP veteran Doris Stevens, and a few others attempted to present the Equal Rights Treaty to President [[Gaston Doumergue]] of France, while he was hosting negotiations of the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]].  They were refused entry and when they refused to leave the gates, they were held in custody for a few hours.)

Even though the United States was not a member of the [[League of Nations]], the NWP focused its Treaty efforts there, using its relationships with Latin American women's groups for support.  Again, social feminists opposed the Treaty because of they believed it would undermine international protectionist labor laws benefitting women. Ultimately, the League of Nations reported the Treaty back to national governments, women's groups, and the International Labor Office, which was a social feminist organization. With the NWP excluded from the decision-making, in 1938 Alice Paul formed the World Women's Party with European equalitarian feminists but the organization was unable to make great strides in the near-term because of the outbreak of [[World War II]].

===The Post-War Period and International Women's Rights===
The post-war battles between women’s groups resolved themselves along the same lines as the pre-war battles, with the NWP and equalitarians on one side and social feminists on the other. This time, they would battle over the establishment of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. NWP's position as a strong backer of a UN Commission placed it at odds with other groups, including the League of Women Voters.

In 1946, Betty was in London as a National Woman's Party representative to the World Women’s Party  along with British feminist [[Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence]].  The NWP supported international efforts like creating a UN commission on women partly in the hope that it would secure the ERA at home.  Others opposed those efforts for the same reason.  [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], who was anti-ERA and viewed as an opponent of the NWP, was a representative to the UN Conference. These disputes left American women on the sidelines to some extent and the effort to create a UN commission for women was led by New Zealand. On February 16, 1946 the sub-Commission on the Status of Women was formed as part of the Human Rights Commission, and granted full status after its first meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Women’s History, Winter 2008, Laville, Helen.

[[Image:Degradation alfred dreyfus.jpg|thumb|On January 5, 1895, Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]] being cashiered]]
'''Cashiering''' (or '''degradation ceremony'''), generally within [[military]] forces, is a [[ritual]] dismissal of an individual from some position of responsibility for a breach of [[discipline]].

==Etymology==
From the Flemish 'Kasseren' the phrase entered the English language in the late 16th century, during the wars in the [[Low Countries]]. Although the [[Oxford English Dictionary|O.E.D.]] states that the first printed use in this sense appears in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (1603), it appeared in the 1595 tract ''The Estate of English Fugitives'' by [[Lewes Lewkenor]], 'imploring his help and assistance in so hard an extremity, who for recompence, very charitably cashiered them all without the receipt of one penny'.

==Military==
[[File:Galons arrachés à Alfred Dreyfus le jour de sa dégradation.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred Dreyfus]]'s ripped off officer stripes, kept in Paris's [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme]]]]
It is especially associated with the public degradation of disgraced [[military]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. Prior to World War I this aspect of cashiering sometimes involved a parade-ground ceremony in front of assembled troops  with the destruction of symbols of [[Social status|status]]: [[epaulette]]s ripped off shoulders, [[badge]]s and insignia stripped, [[sword]]s broken, [[cap]]s knocked away, and [[medal]]s torn off and dashed upon the ground.

The term originated in the era when [[British Army]] officers generally [[Sale of commissions|bought their commissions]]; being cashiered meant that the amount they had paid was lost, as they could not "sell-out" afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Holmes (military historian) |title=Redcoat: the British soldier in the age of horse and musket |origyear=2001 |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition=Hardback |series= |year=2001 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=[[London]] |language= |isbn=0-00-257097-1 |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter= Chapter III - Brothers of the Blade|chapterurl= |quote=|page=159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the commission purchase price was a cash bond for good behaviour, forfeited to the Army's cashiers (accountants) in the event of cowardice, desertion or gross misbehaviour.

==Famous examples==
Famous victims of cashiering include [[Francis Mitchell]] (1621), [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald]] (after the [[Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814]]), [[Alfred Dreyfus]] (1894, see [[trial and conviction of Alfred Dreyfus]] and [[Dreyfus affair]]), and [[Philippe Pétain#Postwar trial and legacy|Philippe Pétain]] (1945).

While most closely associated with Captain Dreyfus, the ceremony of formal degradation (''Degradation militaire'') occurred several times in the French military under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. At least one other army officer and a naval officer were subjected to the ritual of having their swords broken and the insignia, braid and buttons publicly torn from their uniforms, after being found guilty of charges of treason. More commonly a number of NCOs and private soldiers underwent similar punishments for committing various serious offenses, before execution or imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jean-Louis|last=Larcade|page=529|title=Zouaves &amp; Tirailleurs: les regiments de march et les regiments mixes (1914–1918). |ISBN=2-9515171-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chanchala''' is a [[Sanskrit]] [[adjective]] basically referring to the unsteady vacillating nature of human mind and actions which need to be stilled, neutralized or controlled for gaining right speech and vision.

==Meaning==

'''Chanchala''' ([[Sanskrit]]: चञ्चल) means - 'inconsiderate', 'nimble', 'shaking', 'inconstant', 'moveable', 'flickering', 'moving', 'unsteady', 'fortune', 'wind', 'long pepper', 'goddess of fortune' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+chanchala&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==

''Chanchala'' is the good word for 'vacillation' in Sanskrit language; in [[Sanskrit literature
Sanskrit|poetry]] the girl with the dancing eyes is called ''chanchalakshi'', which is considered to be rare attribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A More Ardent Fire|author=Eknath Easwaran|publisher=Nilgiri Press|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxcNUISHyXEC&amp;pg=PT176&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lDkoU7mABIb8rAfj4YCwBg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as part of the literary evidence of [[Kushan Empire|Kusana period]], the word ''Chanchala'', like ''Dhavani'' and ''Rodini'', indicates the nature or action of [[Mother goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribal Roots of Hinduism|author=Shiv Kumar Tiwari|publisher=Sarup&amp;Sons|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0gwfmPFTLgC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VDsoU5qnB8WJrQeI0YG4CQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBDgy#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bhagavad Gita]](Sloka VI.26):
:यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् |
:ततस्ततो नियम्यैतदात्मन्येव वंश नयेत् ||
the word Chanchala used in the first line refers to the restless and the unsteady mind that wanders away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy Geeta|author=Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=446|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVw_Rff7m7AC&amp;pg=PA446&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1TkoU4rWJs2HrgelpoHwAQ&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dasam Granth]], which like the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is an important book of [[Sikhism]], it is not composed in [[raga]]s (its first composition dates 1684 A.D.) tells us that ''Chanchala'' is the name a ''[[chhand]]'' or metre of sixteen syllables having ''ragan'', ''jagan'', ''ragan'', ''jagan'' and ''laghu'' consecutively in each quarter, this metre is also known as ''Chitra'', ''Biraj and ''Brahmrupak'', and has been used twice in ''Choubis Autar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dasam Granth|author=S.S.Kapoor|publisher=Hemkunt Press|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-h8ptzp0lUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uD0oU_G0IYayrgfn2IBQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBjha#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In theology==

''Chanchala'', meaning, 'the fickle-fortune', is one of the many names of [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism Vol.3|publisher=Sarup&amp;Sons|page=788|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNQ82_yYeK8C&amp;pg=PA788&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mTwoU9PQN4KMrgeh0IDQAQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjhG#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no mention of ''Lakshmi'' in the [[Rig Veda]]. [[Lakshmi|Sri]] of the Rig Veda is deified as a personified being in the [[Yajurveda]], and in the [[Atharvaveda]] (I.18) she is prayed to secure prosperity. ''Jatavedas Agni'' is repeatedly asked to make the goddess come to the votary; the epithet ''anapagamini'' reflects the ''chanchala'' i.e. fleet or fickle aspect of the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Goddesses in Ancient India|author=Prithvi Kumar Agrawal |publisher=Abhinav Publications|pages=92–97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FHvf59ceLEC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FzwoU5f0DouMrgfU0IFI&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lakshmi'' or ''Chanchala'' as the mobile one associates only with the rich and the dynamic, no matter what their caste, creed or colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devi: Tales of the Goddess of Our Time|author=Mrinala Pande|publisher=Penguin Books|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1TLsJW-WInIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8TgoU_2hEoWyrAekvoDQBw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because ''Lakshmi'' is ''chanchala'' i.e. quick on her feet, to make her ''achala'' i.e. 'immobile', she needs to be worshipped quietly so that she does not get distracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Age Purohit Darpan: Lakshmi Puja|publisher=Associatian of Grandparents of Indian Migrants|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OxMvAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TT4oU8jnC8e-rgfq14DgCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADhu#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charity''' is an English feminine given name derived from the English word ''[[charity (virtue)|charity]]''. It was used by the [[Puritans]] as a [[virtue name]]. An earlier form of the name, Caritas, was an early Christian name in use by Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Campbell |url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/charity |title=Meaning, origin and history of the name Charity |publisher=Behind the Name |date= |accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charity is also the usual English form of the name of [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity|Saint Charity]], an early Christian child martyr, who was tortured to death with her sisters Faith and Hope. She is known as Agape in [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] and as Caritas in [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Church Latin]] and her name is translated differently in other languages.

Faith, Hope and Charity, the [[theological virtues|three theological virtues]], are names traditionally given to [[Multiple birth|triplet]] girls, just as Faith and Hope remain common names for [[twin]] girls. One example were the American triplets Faith, Hope and Charity Cardwell, who were born in 1899 in [[Texas]] and were recognized in 1994 by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's longest lived triplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe |first=Sam |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/garden/at-home-with-faith-hope-and-charity-285-years-young.html |title=AT HOME WITH - Faith, Hope and Charity - 285 Years Young |location=Sweetwater (Tex) |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1994-07-07 |accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charity has never been as popular a name in the [[United States]] as [[Faith (given name)|Faith]] or [[Hope (given name)|Hope]]. It ranked in the top 500 names for American girls between 1880 and 1898 and in the top 1,000 between 1880 and 1927, when it disappeared from the top 1,000 names until it reemerged among the top 1,000 names in 1968 at No. 968. It was most popular between 1973 and 1986, when it ranked among the top 300 names in the United States. It has since declined in popularity and was ranked at No. 852 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi |title=Popular Baby Names |publisher=Ssa.gov |date=2015-02-12 |accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It holds that objects have certain pairs of complementary properties which cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously.

The complementarity principle was formulated by [[Niels Bohr]], a leading founder of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Evan Harris|title=The Physics of Consciousness|year=2000|publisher=Perseus|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-7382-0436-6|page=271|quote=...the founders of quantum mechanics – [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Schrödinger]] and Bohr...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of complementary properties that Bohr considered:

* [[uncertainty principle|Position and momentum]]
* Energy and duration
* [[Spin (physics)|Spin]] on different axes
* [[Wave-particle duality|Wave and particle]]-related properties
* Value of a [[Field (physics)|field]] and its change (at a certain position)
* [[Quantum entanglement|Entanglement]] and coherence&lt;ref&gt; Cramer, J. G. et al. "An Inquiry into the Possibility of Nonlocal Quantum Communication". Foundation of Phys. Submitted. Revised Feb., 2015 [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.5098v2.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
For example, the [[wave-particle duality|particle and wave aspects]] of physical objects are such complementary phenomena.  Both concepts are borrowed from [[classical mechanics]], where it is impossible to be a particle and wave at the same time. Therefore, it is impossible to measure  the ''full'' properties of the wave and particle at a particular moment.&lt;ref name="Baggott2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jim Baggott]] |title=The Quantum Story: A History in|year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Bohr implies that it is not possible to regard objects governed by quantum mechanics as having intrinsic properties independent of determination with a measuring device, a viewpoint supported by the [[Kochen-Specker theorem]]. The type of measurement determines which property is shown. However the single and [[double-slit experiment]] and other experiments show that ''some'' effects of wave and particle can be measured in one measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = María C. | last = Boscá Díaz-Pintado | title = Updating the wave-particle duality | booktitle = 15th UK and European Meeting on the Foundations of Physics | pages = | publisher = | date = 29–31 March 2007 | location = Leeds, UK | url = http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00003568/ | doi = | accessdate = 2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
An aspect of complementarity is that it not only applies to measurability or knowability of some property of a physical entity, but more importantly it applies to the limitations of that physical entity’s very manifestation of the property in the physical world.  All properties of physical entities exist only in pairs, which Bohr described as complementary or conjugate pairs.  Physical reality is determined and defined by manifestations of properties which are limited by trade-offs between these complementary pairs.  For example, an electron can manifest a greater and greater accuracy of its position only in even trade for a complementary loss in accuracy of manifesting its momentum.  This means that there is a limitation on the precision with which an electron can possess (i.e., manifest) position, since an infinitely precise position would dictate that its manifested momentum would be infinitely imprecise, or undefined (i.e., non-manifest or not possessed), which is not possible.  The ultimate limitations in precision of property manifestations are quantified by the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] and [[Planck units]].  Complementarity and Uncertainty dictate that therefore all properties and actions in the physical world manifest themselves as non-deterministic to some degree.

Physicists F.A.M. Frescura and [[Basil Hiley]] have summarized the reasons for the introduction of the principle of complementarity in physics as follows:&lt;ref&gt;F. A. M. Frescura, [[Basil Hiley|B. J. Hiley]]: [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/P12FrescandHiley3.pdf ''Algebras, quantum theory and pre-space''], published in Revista Brasileira de Fisica, Volume Especial, Julho 1984, Os 70 anos de Mario Schonberg, pp. 49–86, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;
::“In the traditional view, it is assumed that there exists a reality in space-time and that this reality is a given thing, all of whose aspects can be viewed or articulated at any given moment. Bohr was the first to point out that quantum mechanics called this traditional outlook into question. To him the ‘indivisibility of the quantum of action’, which was his way of describing the uncertainty principle, implied that not all aspects of a system can be viewed simultaneously. By using one particular piece of apparatus only certain features could be made manifest at the expense of others, while with a different piece of apparatus another complementary aspect could be made manifest in such a way that the original set became non-manifest, that is, the original attributes were no longer well defined. For Bohr, this was an indication that the principle of complementarity, a principle that he had previously known to appear extensively in other intellectual disciplines but which did not appear in classical physics, should be adopted as a universal principle.”
The emergence of complementarity in a system occurs when one considers the circumstances under which one attempts to measure its properties; as Bohr noted, the principle of complementarity "implies the impossibility of any sharp separation between the behaviour of atomic objects and the interaction with the measuring instruments that serve to define the conditions under which the phenomena appear."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Foundations of Quantum Physics II (1933-1958) |author=Jørgen Kalckar, [[Niels Bohr]], [[Léon Rosenfeld]], Erik Rüdinger, Finn Aaserud |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yet5P7f_63oC&amp;pg=RA1-PA210&amp;dq=impossibility+of+any+sharp+separation+between+the+behaviour+of+atomic+objects+and+the+interaction+with+the+measuring+instruments#v=onepage&amp;q=impossibility%20of%20any%20sharp%20separation%20between%20the%20behaviour%20of%20atomic%20objects%20and%20the%20interaction%20with%20the%20measuring%20instruments&amp;f=false |publisher=Elsevier |page=210 |isbn=978-0-444-89892-0 |year=1996 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to distinguish, as did Bohr in his original statements, the principle of complementarity from a statement of the uncertainty principle. For a technical discussion of contemporary issues surrounding complementarity in physics see, e.g., Bandyopadhyay (2000),&lt;ref name="Bandyopadhyay2000"&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=quant-ph/0003073 |title=Welcher Weg Experiments and the Orthodox Bohr's Complementarity Principle |first=Supriyo |last=Bandyopadhyay |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(00)00670-8|bibcode = 2000PhLA..276..233B |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=276 |issue=5–6 |pages=233–239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from which parts of this discussion were drawn.

==Additional considerations==
In his original lecture on the topic, Bohr pointed out that just as the finitude of the speed of light implies the impossibility of a sharp separation between space and time (relativity), the finitude of the [[Planck constant|quantum of action]] implies the impossibility of a sharp separation between the behavior of a system and its interaction with the measuring instruments and leads to the well known difficulties with the concept of 'state' in quantum theory; the notion of complementarity is intended to symbolize this new situation in epistemology created by quantum theory. Some people consider it a philosophical adjunct to [[quantum mechanics]], while others consider it to be a discovery that is as important as the formal aspects of quantum theory. Examples of the latter include [[Leon Rosenfeld]], who claimed that "[C]omplementarity is not a philosophical superstructure invented by Bohr to be placed as a decoration on top of the quantal formalism, it is the bedrock of the quantal description.",&lt;ref name="Bohr1996a"&gt;{{cite book |author=Niels Bohr |authorlink=Niels Bohr |author2=fwd.

==Experiments==
The quintessential example of wave–particle complementarity in the laboratory is the [[double slit]]. The crux of the complementary behavior is the question: "What information exists – embedded in the constituents of the universe – that can reveal the history of the signal particles as they pass through the double slit?" If information exists (even if it [[quantum eraser|is not measured by a conscious observer]]) that reveals "which slit" each particle traversed, then each particle will exhibit no wave interference with the other slit. This is the particle-like behavior. But if ''no information'' exists about which slit – so that no conscious observer, no matter how well equipped, will ever be able to determine which slit each particle traverses – then the signal particles will interfere with themselves as if they traveled through both slits at the same time, as a wave. This is the wave-like behavior. These behaviors are complementary, according to the [[Englert–Greenberger duality relation]], because when one behavior is observed the other is absent. Both behaviors ''can'' be observed at the same time, but each only as lesser manifestations of their full behavior (as determined by the duality relation). This superposition of complementary behaviors exists whenever there is partial "which slit" information. While there is some contention to the duality relation, and thus complementarity itself, the [[Afshar experiment|contrary position]] is not accepted by mainstream physics.&lt;ref name=Haroche&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Haroche | first1 =Serge | last2 =Raimond | first2 =Jean-Michel | title =Exploring the Quantum: Atoms, Cavities, and Photons | publisher =Oxford University Press | edition =1st  | year =2006 | isbn =978-0198509141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35–40}} Double slit experiments with single photons show clearly that photons are particles at the same time as they are waves. Photons impact the screen where they are detected in points, and when enough points have accumulated the wave aspect is clearly visible. Also the particle and wave aspect is seen at the same time in photons that are stationary.

Various [[neutron interferometry]] experiments demonstrate the subtlety of the notions of duality and complementarity. By passing through the [[interferometer]], the [[neutron]] appears to act as a wave.  Yet upon passage, the neutron is subject to [[gravitation]]. As the neutron interferometer is rotated through Earth's [[gravitational field]] a phase change between the two arms of the interferometer can be observed, accompanied by a change in the constructive and destructive interference of the neutron waves on exit from the interferometer.  Some interpretations claim that understanding the interference effect requires one to concede that a single neutron takes both paths through the interferometer at the same time; a single neutron would "be in two places at once", as it were.  Since the two paths through a neutron interferometer can be as far as {{nowrap|5 cm}} to {{nowrap|15 cm}} apart, the effect is hardly microscopic. This is similar to traditional double-slit and mirror interferometer experiments where the slits (or mirrors) can be arbitrarily far apart. So, in interference and diffraction experiments, neutrons behave the same way as photons (or electrons) of corresponding wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
Niels Bohr apparently conceived of the principle of complementarity during a skiing vacation in Norway in February and March 1927, during which he received a letter from [[Werner Heisenberg]] regarding the latter's newly discovered (and not yet published) [[uncertainty principle]].  Upon returning from his vacation, by which time Heisenberg had already submitted his paper on the uncertainty principle for publication, he convinced Heisenberg that the uncertainty principle was a manifestation of the deeper concept of complementarity.&lt;ref name="Baggott2011"/&gt; Heisenberg duly appended a note to this effect to his paper on the uncertainty principle, before its publication, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bohr has brought to my attention [that] the uncertainty in our observation does not arise exclusively from the occurrence of discontinuities, but is tied directly to the demand that we ascribe equal validity to the quite different experiments which show up in the [particulate] theory on one hand, and in the wave theory on the other hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bohr publicly introduced the principle of complementarity in a lecture he delivered on 16 September 1927 at the International Physics Congress held in [[Como, Italy]], attended by most of the leading physicists of the era, with the notable exceptions of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], and [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]].  However, these three were in attendance one month later when Bohr again presented the principle at the [[Solvay Congress|Fifth Solvay Congress]] in [[Brussels, Belgium]].  The lecture was published in the proceedings of both of these conferences, and was republished the following year in ''Naturwissenschaften'' (in German) and in ''Nature'' (in English).&lt;ref name="Bohr1928English"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bohr N |title=The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory |journal=Nature |volume=121 |pages=580–590 |year=1928 |doi= 10.1038/121580a0|bibcode =   1928Natur.121..580B}}  Available in the collection of Bohr's early writings, ''Atomic Theory and the Description of Nature'' (1934).&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of complex event processing is to identify meaningful events (such as [[business opportunity|opportunities]] or threats)&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;{{citation|last=Bates|first=John|title=John Bates of Progress explains how complex event processing works and how it can simplify the use of algorithms for finding and capturing trading opportunities|url=http://fixglobal.com/home/secrets-revealed-trading-tools-uncover-hidden-opportunities/|publisher=Fix Global Trading|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and respond to them as quickly as possible.

These events may be happening across the various layers of an organization as sales leads, orders or customer service calls. Or, they may be news items,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Crosman|first=Penny|title=Aleri, Ravenpack to Feed News into Trading Algos|url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/articles/217500395|publisher=Wall Street &amp; Technology|date=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; text messages, social media posts, stock market feeds, traffic reports, weather reports, or other kinds of data.&lt;ref name=LuckhamD /&gt; An event may also be defined as a "change of state," when a measurement exceeds a predefined threshold of time, temperature, or other value. Analysts suggest that CEP will give organizations a new way to analyze patterns in real-time and help the business side communicate better with IT and service departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McKay|first=Lauren|title=Forrester Gives a Welcoming Wave to Complex Event Processing|url=http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/CRM-News/Daily-News/Forrester-Gives-a-Welcoming-Wave-to-Complex-Event-Processing-55492.aspx|publisher=Destination CRM|date=August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast amount of information available about events is sometimes referred to as the event cloud.&lt;ref name=LuckhamD /&gt;

==Conceptual description==

Among thousands of incoming events, a monitoring system may for instance receive the following three from the same source:

# church bells ringing.
# the appearance of a man in a tuxedo with a woman in a flowing white gown.
# rice flying through the air.

From these events the monitoring system may infer a ''complex event'': a wedding. CEP as a technique helps discover complex events by analyzing and correlating other events:&lt;ref&gt;D. Luckham, "The Power of Events: An Introduction to Complex Event Processing in Distributed Enterprise Systems", Addison-Wesley, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the bells, the man and woman in wedding attire and the rice flying through the air.

CEP relies on a number of techniques,&lt;ref&gt;O. Etzion and P. Niblett, "Event Processing in Action", Manning Publications, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* Event-[[pattern detection]]
* Event [[abstraction]]
* Event filtering
* Event aggregation and transformation 
* Modeling event hierarchies
* Detecting relationships (such as [[causality]], [[meronymy|membership]] or [[Synchronization|timing]]) between events
* Abstracting [[event-driven programming|event-driven]] processes

Commercial applications of CEP exist in variety of industries and include [[Algorithmic trading|algorithmic stock-trading]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://fixglobal.com/home/secrets-revealed-trading-tools-uncover-hidden-opportunities/ Complex Event Processing for Trading], FIXGlobal, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the detection of [[credit card fraud|credit-card fraud]], [[business activity monitoring]], and security monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.complexevents.com Details of commercial products and use cases]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CEP area has roots in [[discrete event simulation]], the [[active database]] area and some programming languages. The activity in the industry was preceded by a wave of research projects in the 1990s. According to&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Leavit|first=Neal|title=Complex-Event Processing Poised for Growth|url= http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2009/04/mco2009040017-abs.html|publisher=Computer, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 17-20 Washington|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first project that paved the way to a generic CEP language and execution model was the Rapide project in [[Stanford University]], directed by [[David Luckham]]. In parallel there have been two other research projects: Infospheres in [[California Institute of Technology]], directed by [[K. Mani Chandy]], and [[Apama (software)|Apama]] in [[University of Cambridge]] directed by John Bates. The commercial products were dependents of the concepts developed in these and some later research projects. Community efforts started  in a series of event processing symposiums organized by the [[Event Processing Technical Society]], and later by the ACM DEBS conference series. One of the community efforts was to produce the event processing manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2011/2985|title=10201 Executive Summary and Manifesto – Event Processing|first1=Mani K.|last1=Chandy|first2=Opher|last2=Etzion|first3=Rainer von|last3=Ammon|editor-first1=K.

==Related concepts==

CEP is used in [[operational intelligence]] (OI) products to provide insight into business operations by running query analysis against live feeds and event data. OI collects real-time data and correlates against historical data to provide insight and analysis. Multiple sources of data can be combined to provide a common operating picture that uses current information. 

In [[network management]], [[systems management]], [[application management]] and [[service management]], people usually refer instead to [[event correlation]]. As CEP engines, event correlation engines (''event correlators'') analyze a mass of events, pinpoint the most significant ones, and trigger actions. However, most of them do not produce new inferred events. Instead, they relate high-level events with low-level events.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Martin-Flatin, G. Jakobson and L. Lewis, "Event Correlation in Integrated Management: Lessons Learned and Outlook", Journal of Network and Systems Management, Vol. 17, No. 4, December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inference engine]]s, e.g., [[rule-based system|rule-based reasoning engine]]s, typically produce inferred information in [[artificial intelligence]]. However, they do not usually produce new information in the form of complex (i.e., inferred) events.

==Example==
A more systemic example of CEP involves a car, some sensors and various events and reactions. Imagine that a car has several sensors—one that measures tire pressure, one that measures speed, and one that detects if someone sits on a seat or leaves a seat.

In the first situation, the car is moving and the pressure of one of the tires moves from 45 [[pound per square inch|psi]] to 41 psi over 15 minutes. As the pressure in the tire is decreasing, a series of events containing the tire pressure is generated. In addition, a series of events containing the speed of the car is generated. The car's Event Processor may detect a situation whereby a loss of tire pressure over a relatively long period of time results in the creation of the "lossOfTirePressure" event. This new event may trigger a reaction process to note the pressure loss into the car's maintenance log, and alert the driver via the car's portal that the tire pressure has reduced.

In the second situation, the car is moving and the pressure of one of the tires drops from 45 psi to 20 psi in 5 seconds. A different situation is detected—perhaps because the loss of pressure occurred over a shorter period of time, or perhaps because the difference in values between each event were larger than a predefined limit. The different situation results in a new event "blowOutTire" being generated. This new event triggers a different reaction process to immediately alert the driver and to initiate onboard computer routines to assist the driver in bringing the car to a stop without losing control through skidding.

In addition, events that represent detected situations can also be combined with other events in order to detect more complex situations. For example, in the final situation the car is moving normally and suffers a blown tire which results in the car leaving the road and striking a tree, and the driver is thrown from the car. A series of different situations are rapidly detected. The combination of "blowOutTire", "zeroSpeed" and "driverLeftSeat" within a very short period of time results in a new situation being detected: "occupantThrownAccident". Even though there is no direct measurement that can determine conclusively that the driver was thrown, or that there was an accident, the combination of events allows the situation to be detected and a new event to be created to signify the detected situation. This is the essence of a complex (or composite) event. It is complex because one cannot directly detect the situation; one has to infer or deduce that the situation has occurred from a combination of other events.

==Integration with business process management==
A natural fit for CEP has been with [[business process management]] (BPM).&lt;ref&gt;C. Janiesch, M. Matzner and O. Müller: "A Blueprint for Event-Driven Business Activity Management", Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2011, Volume 6896/2011, 17-28, {{doi|10.1007/978-3-642-23059-2_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; BPM focuses on end-to-end business processes, in order to continuously optimize and align for its operational environment.

However, the optimization of a business does not rely solely upon its individual, end-to-end processes. Seemingly disparate processes can affect each other significantly. Consider this scenario:
In the aerospace industry, it is good practice to monitor breakdowns of vehicles to look for trends (determine potential weaknesses in manufacturing processes, material, etc.). Another separate process monitors current operational vehicles' life cycles and decommissions them when appropriate. One use for CEP is to link these separate processes, so that in the case of the initial process (breakdown monitoring) discovering a malfunction based on metal fatigue (a significant event), an action can be created to exploit the second process (life cycle) to issue a recall on vehicles using the same batch of metal discovered as faulty in the initial process.

The integration of CEP and BPM must exist at two levels, both at the business awareness level (users must understand the potential holistic benefits of their individual processes) and also at the technological level (there needs to be a method by which CEP can interact with BPM implementation). For a recent state of the art review on the integration of CEP with BPM, which is frequently labeled as Event-Driven Business Process Management, refer to.&lt;ref&gt;J. Krumeich, B. Weis, D. Werth and P. Loos: "Event-Driven Business Process Management: where are we now?: A comprehensive synthesis and analysis of literature", Business Process Management Journal, 2014, Volume 20, 615-633, {{doi|10.1108/BPMJ-07-2013-0092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computation-oriented CEP's role can arguably be seen to overlap with Business Rule technology.

For example, customer service centers are using CEP for click-stream analysis and customer experience management. CEP software can factor real-time information about millions of events (clicks or other interactions) per second into business intelligence and other decision-support applications. These "recommendation applications" help agents provide personalized service based on each customer's experience. The CEP application may collect data about what customers on the phone are currently doing, or how they have recently interacted with the company in other various channels, including in-branch, or on the Web via self-service features, instant messaging and email.

The financial services industry was an early adopter of CEP technology, using complex event processing to structure and contextualize available data so that it could inform trading behavior, specifically [[algorithmic trading]], by identifying opportunities or threats that indicate traders (or automatic trading systems) should buy or sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Rise of Unstructured Data in Trading|url=http://aitegroup.com/report/rise-unstructured-data-trading|publisher=Aite Group|date=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a trader wants to track stocks that have five up movements followed by four down movements, CEP technology can track such an event. CEP technology can also track drastic rise and fall in number of trades. Algorithmic trading is already a practice in stock trading. It is estimated that around 60% of Equity trading in the United States is by way of algorithmic trades.  CEP is expected to continue to help financial institutions improve their algorithms and be more efficient.

Recent improvements in CEP technologies have made it more affordable, helping smaller firms to create trading algorithms of their own and compete with larger firms.&lt;ref name=Bates /&gt; CEP has evolved from an emerging technology to an essential platform of many capital markets. The technology's most consistent growth has been in banking, serving fraud detection, online banking, and multichannel marketing initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Complex Event Processing: Beyond Capital Markets|url=http://www.aitegroup.com/Reports/ReportDetail.aspx?recordItemID=870|publisher=Aite Group|date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a wide variety of financial applications use CEP, including profit, loss, and [[Financial risk management|risk management]] systems, [[Order book (trading)|order]] and [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] analysis, [[Quantitative investing|quantitative trading]] and signal generation systems, and others.

==Integration with time series databases==
A [[time series database]] is a software system that is optimized for the handling of data organized by time. Time series are finite or infinite sequences of data items, where each item has an associated timestamp and the sequence of timestamps is non-decreasing. Elements of a time series are often called ticks. The timestamps are not required to be ascending (merely non-decreasing) because in practice the time resolution of some systems such as financial data sources can be quite low (milliseconds, microseconds or even nanoseconds), so consecutive events may carry equal timestamps.

Time series data provides a historical context to the analysis typically associated with complex event processing. This can apply to any vertical industry such as finance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/shasha/papers/jagtalk.html|title=Time Series in Finance|website=cs.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cooperatively with other technologies such as BPM.

Consider the scenario in finance where there is a need to understand historic price volatility to determine statistical thresholds of future price movements. This is helpful for both trade models and transaction cost analysis.

The ideal case for CEP analysis is to view historical time series and real-time streaming data as a single time continuum. What happened yesterday, last week or last month is simply an extension of what is occurring today and what may occur in the future. An example may involve comparing current market volumes to historic volumes, prices and volatility for trade execution logic. Or the need to act upon live market prices may involve comparisons to benchmarks that include sector and index movements, whose intra-day and historic trends gauge volatility and smooth outliers.

==Internet of Things and Smart Cyber-physical systems==
Complex event processing is a key enabler in [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) settings and Smart [[Cyber-physical system]]s (CPS) as well. Processing dense and heterogeneous streams from various sensors and matching patterns against those streams is a typical task in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/istvan/pub/mtcps2016|title=Balogh, Dávid, Ráth, Varró, Vörös: Distributed and Heterogeneous Event-based Monitoring in Smart Cyber-Physical Systems, In 1st Workshop on Monitoring and Testing of Cyber-Physical Systems, Vienna, Austria. 2016.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these techniques rely on the fact that representing the IoT system's state and its changes is more efficient in the form of a data stream, instead of having a static, materialized model. Reasoning over such stream-based models fundamentally differs from traditional reasoning techniques and typically require the combination of [[model transformation]]s and CEP.&lt;ref&gt;I. Dávid, I.

{{Too many quotes|date=May 2015}}
"'''Darwin among the Machines'''" is the name of an article published in ''[[The Press]]'' newspaper on 13 June 1863 in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, which references the work of [[Charles Darwin]] in the title. Written by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] but signed ''[[Cellarius (name)|Cellarius]]'' ([[q.v.]]), the article raised the possibility that [[machines]] were a kind of "mechanical life" undergoing constant [[evolution]], and that eventually machines might supplant humans as the dominant species:
{{quote|We refer to the question: What sort of creature man’s next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be. We have often heard this debated; but it appears to us that we are ourselves creating our own successors; we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation; we are daily giving them greater power and supplying by all sorts of ingenious contrivances that self-regulating, self-acting power which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race. In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race.
...

Day by day, however, the machines are gaining ground upon us; day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of their whole lives to the development of mechanical life. The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}

The article ends by urging that, "War to the death should be instantly proclaimed against them. Every machine of every sort should be destroyed by the well-wisher of his species. Let there be no exceptions made, no quarter shown; let us at once go back to the primeval condition of the race."

==''Book of the Machines''==
Butler developed this and subsequent articles into ''The Book of the Machines'', three chapters of ''[[Erewhon]]'', published anonymously in 1872. The Erewhonian society Butler envisioned had long ago undergone a revolution that destroyed most mechanical inventions. The narrator of the story finds a book that details the reasons for this revolution, which he translates for the reader. In &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;
chapter xxiii: the book of the machines&lt;/span&gt;, a number of quotes from this imaginary book discuss the possibility of machine consciousness:
{{quote|"There is no security"--to quote his own words--"against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now. A mollusc has not much consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organized machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time.
...

“Either,” he proceeds, “a great deal of action that has been called purely mechanical and unconscious must be admitted to contain more elements of consciousness than has been allowed hitherto (and in this case germs of consciousness will be found in many actions of the higher machines)—Or (assuming the theory of evolution but at the same time denying the consciousness of vegetable and crystalline action) the race of man has descended from things which had no consciousness at all. In this case there is no ''à priori'' improbability in the descent of conscious (and more than conscious) machines from those which now exist, except that which is suggested by the apparent absence of anything like a reproductive system in the mechanical kingdom.}}
Later, in &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;chapter xxiv: the machines—continued&lt;/span&gt;, the imaginary book also discusses the notion that machines can "reproduce" like living organisms:
{{quote|“But the machines which reproduce machinery do not reproduce machines after their own kind. A thimble may be made by machinery, but it was not made by, neither will it ever make, a thimble. Here, again, if we turn to nature we shall find abundance of analogies which will teach us that a reproductive system may be in full force without the thing produced being of the same kind as that which produced it. Very few creatures reproduce after their own kind; they reproduce something which has the potentiality of becoming that which their parents were. Thus the butterfly lays an egg, which egg can become a caterpillar, which caterpillar can become a chrysalis, which chrysalis can become a butterfly; and though I freely grant that the machines cannot be said to have more than the germ of a true reproductive system at present, have we not just seen that they have only recently obtained the germs of a mouth and stomach?  And may not some stride be made in the direction of true reproduction which shall be as great as that which has been recently taken in the direction of true feeding?

“It is possible that the system when developed may be in many cases a vicarious thing. Certain classes of machines may be alone fertile, while the rest discharge other functions in the mechanical system, just as the great majority of ants and bees have nothing to do with the continuation of their species, but get food and store it, without thought of breeding. One cannot expect the parallel to be complete or nearly so; certainly not now, and probably never; but is there not enough analogy existing at the present moment, to make us feel seriously uneasy about the future, and to render it our duty to check the evil while we can still do so?  Machines can within certain limits beget machines of any class, no matter how different to themselves. Every class of machines will probably have its special mechanical breeders, and all the higher ones will owe their existence to a large number of parents and not to two only.

“Complex now, but how much simpler and more intelligibly organised may it not become in another hundred thousand years? or in twenty thousand?  For man at present believes that his interest lies in that direction; he spends an incalculable amount of labour and time and thought in making machines breed always better and better; he has already succeeded in effecting much that at one time appeared impossible, and there seem no limits to the results of accumulated improvements if they are allowed to descend with modification from generation to generation.}}
This notion of machine "reproduction" anticipates the later notion of [[self-replicating machine]]s, although in &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;chapter xxv: the machines—concluded&lt;/span&gt;, the imaginary book supposes that while there is a danger that humans will become subservient to machines, the machines will still need humans to assist in their reproduction and maintenance:
{{quote|“Herein lies our danger. For many seem inclined to acquiesce in so dishonourable a future. They say that although man should become to the machines what the horse and dog are to us, yet that he will continue to exist, and will probably be better off in a state of domestication under the beneficent rule of the machines than in his present wild condition. We treat our domestic animals with much kindness. We give them whatever we believe to be the best for them; and there can be no doubt that our use of meat has increased their happiness rather than detracted from it. In like manner there is reason to hope that the machines will use us kindly, for their existence will be in a great measure dependent upon ours; they will rule us with a rod of iron, but they will not eat us; they will not only require our services in the reproduction and education of their young, but also in waiting upon them as servants; in gathering food for them, and feeding them; in restoring them to health when they are sick; and in either burying their dead or working up their deceased members into new forms of mechanical existence.}}
The author of the imaginary book goes on to say that while life under [[machine rule]] might be materially comfortable for humans, the thought of the human race being superseded in the future is just as horrifying to him as the thought that his distant ancestors were anything other than fully human (apparently Butler imagines the author to be an [[Anti-evolution]]ist), so he urges that all machines which have been in use for less than 300 years be destroyed to prevent this future from coming to pass:
{{quote|“The power of custom is enormous, and so gradual will be the change, that man's sense of what is due to himself will be at no time rudely shocked; our bondage will steal upon us noiselessly and by imperceptible approaches; nor will there ever be such a clashing of desires between man and the machines as will lead to an encounter between them. Among themselves the machines will war eternally, but they will still require man as the being through whose agency the struggle will be principally conducted. In point of fact there is no occasion for anxiety about the future happiness of man so long as he continues to be in any way profitable to the machines; he may become the inferior race, but he will be infinitely better off than he is now. Is it not then both absurd and unreasonable to be envious of our benefactors?  And should we not be guilty of consummate folly if we were to reject advantages which we cannot obtain otherwise, merely because they involve a greater gain to others than to ourselves?

“With those who can argue in this way I have nothing in common. I shrink with as much horror from believing that my race can ever be superseded or surpassed, as I should do from believing that even at the remotest period my ancestors were other than human beings. Could I believe that ten hundred thousand years ago a single one of my ancestors was another kind of being to myself, I should lose all self-respect, and take no further pleasure or interest in life. I have the same feeling with regard to my descendants, and believe it to be one that will be felt so generally that the country will resolve upon putting an immediate stop to all further mechanical progress, and upon destroying all improvements that have been made for the last three hundred years. I would not urge more than this. We may trust ourselves to deal with those that remain, and though I should prefer to have seen the destruction include another two hundred years, I am aware of the necessity for compromising, and would so far sacrifice my own individual convictions as to be content with three hundred. Less than this will be insufficient.”}}
Erewhonian society came to the conclusion "...that the machines were ultimately destined to supplant the race of man, and to become instinct with a vitality as different from, and superior to, that of animals, as animal to vegetable life. So... they made a clean sweep of all machinery that had not been in use for more than two hundred and seventy-one years..." (from &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;
chapter ix: to the metropolis&lt;/span&gt;.)

Despite the initial popularity of ''Erewhon'', Butler commented in the preface to the second edition that reviewers had "in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on Machines as an attempt to reduce Mr. Darwin’s theory to an absurdity." He protested that "few things would be more distasteful to me than any attempt to laugh at Mr. Darwin", but also added "I am surprised, however, that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer; neither shall I mention the name of the book here, though I should fancy that the hint given will suffice",&lt;ref&gt;[[Project Gutenberg]] eBook [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1906 ''Erewhon'' by Samuel Butler.]&lt;/ref&gt; which may suggest that the chapter on Machines was in fact a satire intended to illustrate the "specious misuse of analogy", even if the target was not Darwin; Butler, fearing that he had offended Darwin, wrote him a letter explaining that the actual target was [[Joseph Butler]]'s 1736 ''The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature''. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] scholar Herbert Sussman has suggested that although Butler's exploration of machine evolution was intended to be whimsical, he may also have been genuinely interested in the notion that living organisms are a type of mechanism and was exploring this notion with his writings on machines,&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's "the Book of the Machines" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365–383&lt;/ref&gt; while the philosopher Louis Flaccus called it "a mixture of fun, satire, and thoughtful speculation."&lt;ref&gt;Flaccus, Louis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JigdAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false University lectures delivered by members of the faculty in the free public lecture course], p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Evolution of Global Intelligence''==
[[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] applies Butler's original [[premise]] to the [[artificial life]] and [[artificial intelligence|intelligence]] of [[Alan Turing]] in '''''Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence''''' (1998) {{ISBN|0-7382-0030-1}}, to suggest that the internet is a living, [[sentient]] [[being]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dyson's main claim is that the evolution of a conscious mind from today's technology is inevitable. It is not clear whether this will be a single mind or multiple minds, how smart that mind would be, and even if we will be able to communicate with it. He also clearly suggests that there are forms of intelligence on Earth that we are currently unable to understand.

From the book: "What mind, if any, will become apprehensive of the great coiling of ideas now under way is not a meaningless question, but it is still too early in the game to expect an answer that is meaningful to us."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tal.forum2.org/darwin Excerpted from review] by [http://tal.forum2.org/author_Tal%20Cohen Tal Cohen], 30 September 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''{{lang|fr|Différance}}''' is a [[French language|French]] term coined by [[Jacques Derrida]]. It is a central concept in Derrida's [[deconstruction]], a [[Literary critical theory|critical]] outlook concerned with the relationship between text and meaning. The term {{lang|fr|différance}} means "difference and deferral of meaning."

==Overview==
Derrida first uses the term {{lang|fr|différance}} in his 1963 paper "{{lang|fr|Cogito et histoire de la folie|italic=no}}".&lt;ref&gt;"The economy of this writing is a regulated relationship between that which exceeds and the exceeded totality: the {{lang|fr|différance|italic=no}} of the absolute excess." (Derrida, J., 1978. Cogito and the History of Madness. From ''[[Writing and Difference]]''. Trans. A. Bass. London &amp; New York: Routledge. p. 75.) Schultz and Fried in their vast bibliography of Derrida's work cite this sentence as where "JD introduces {{lang|fr|différance|italic=no}}" for the first time. (Schultz, W.R. &amp; Fried, L.B., 1992. ''Jacques Derrida Bibliography''. London &amp; New York: Garland. p. 12.)&lt;/ref&gt; The term {{lang|fr|différance}} then played a key role in Derrida's engagement with the philosophy of [[Edmund Husserl]] in ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]''. The term was then elaborated in various other works, notably in his essay "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}" and in various interviews collected in ''Positions''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Speech and Phenomena and other essays on Husserl's Theory of Signs'', trans.

Alan Bass (Chicago &amp; London: Chicago University Press, 1982) and ''Positions'', trans. Alan Bass (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{angbr|a}} of {{lang|fr|différance}} is a deliberate misspelling of {{lang|fr|différence}}, though the two are pronounced identically, {{IPA-fr|difeʁɑ̃s|IPA}} ({{lang|fr|différance}} plays on the fact that the French word {{lang|fr|[[wikt:différer|différer]]}} means both "to defer" and "to differ"). This misspelling highlights the fact that its written form is not heard, and serves to further subvert the traditional privileging of speech over writing (see [[archi-writing]] and [[logocentrism]]), as well as the distinction between the sensible and the intelligible.  The difference articulated by the {{angbr|a}} in {{lang|fr|différance}} is not apparent to the senses via sound, "but neither cannot it belong to intelligibility, to the ideality which is not fortuitously associated with the objectivity of ''theorein'' or understanding."&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", ''Margins of Philosophy'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because the language of understanding is already caught up in sensible metaphors—for example, {{lang|grc|θεωρεῖν}} ({{transl|grc|theōrein}}) means "to see" in [[Ancient Greek]].

In the essay "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}" Derrida indicates that {{lang|fr|différance}} gestures at a number of heterogeneous features that govern the production of textual meaning. The first (relating to deferral) is the notion that words and signs can never fully summon forth what they mean, but can only be defined through appeal to additional words, from which they differ. Thus, meaning is forever "deferred" or postponed through an endless chain of signifiers. The second (relating to [[Difference (poststructuralism)|difference]], sometimes referred to as ''espacement'' or "spacing") concerns the force that differentiates elements from one another, and in so doing engenders binary oppositions and hierarchies that underpin meaning itself.

Derrida developed the concept of {{lang|fr|différance}} deeper in the course of an argument against the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], who sought a rigorous analysis of the role of [[memory]] and [[perception]] in our understanding of sequential items such as [[music]] or [[language]].  Derrida's approach argues that because the perceiver's mental state is constantly in [[flux]] and differs from one [[Reading (process)|re-reading]] to the next, a general theory describing this phenomenon is unachievable.

A term related to the idea of {{lang|fr|différance}} in Derrida's thought is the ''supplement'', "itself bound up in a supplementary play of meaning which defies semantic reduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norris|first1=Christopher|title=Deconstruction : theory and practice|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415280105|page=32|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Between structure and genesis ==

Derrida approaches texts as constructed around elemental oppositions which all speech has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This is so because identity is viewed in [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]] terms as a construct, and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of [[Difference (poststructuralism)|differences]] inside a "system of distinct signs". This approach to text, in a broad sense,&lt;ref name="Royle04p62"&gt;[[Nicholas Royle|Royle, Nicholas]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nNaSdb9VMTwC ''Jacques Derrida''], pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferraris97p76"&gt;Derrida and Ferraris (1997) p.76
{{quote|I take great interest in questions of language and rhetoric, and I think they deserve enormous consideration; but there is a point where the authority of final jurisdiction is neither rhetorical nor linguistic, nor even discursive. The notion of trace or of text is introduced to mark the limits of the linguistic turn. This is one more reason why I prefer to speak of 'mark' rather than of language. In the first place the mark is not anthropological; it is prelinguistic; it is the possibility of language, and it is every where there is a relation to another thing or relation to an other. For such relations, the mark has no need of language.}}&lt;/ref&gt; emerges from [[semiology]] advanced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].

Saussure is considered one of the fathers of [[structuralism]] when he explained that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language:
{{quote|In language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. ... A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saussure|first=Ferdinand de|title=Course in General Linguistics|year=1916 [trans. 1959]|publisher=New York Philosophical Library|location=New York|pages=121–22|url=http://faculty.smu.edu/dfoster/cf3324/saussure.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saussure explicitly suggested linguistics was only a branch of a more general semiology, of a science of signs in general, being human codes only one among others. Nevertheless, in the end, as Derrida pointed out, he made of linguistics "the regulatory model", and "for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, and everything that links the sign to phone":&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 21
{{quote|Although Saussure recognized the necessity of putting the phonic substance between brackets ("What is essential in language, we shall see, is foreign to the phonic character of the linguistic sign" [p. 21]. "In its essence it [the linguistic signifier] is not at all phonic" [p. 164]), Saussure, for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, everything that links the sign to phone. He also speaks of the "natural link" between thought and voice, meaning and sound (p. 46). He even speaks of "thought-sound" (p. 156). I have attempted elsewhere to show what is traditional in such a gesture, and to what necessities it submits. In any event, it winds up contradicting the most interesting critical motive of the Course, making of linguistics the regulatory model, the "pattern" for a general semiology of which it was to be, by all rights and theoretically, only a part. The theme of the arbitrary, thus, is turned away from its most fruitful paths (formalization) toward a hierarchizing teleology: "Thus it can be said that entirely arbitrary signs realize better than any others the ideal of the semiological process; this is why language, the most complex and most widespread of the systems of expression, is also the most characteristic one of them all; in this sense linguistics can become the general pattern for all semiology, even though language is only a particular system" (p. 101). One finds exactly the same gesture and the same concepts in Hegel. The contradiction between these two moments of the Course is also marked by Saussure's recognizing elsewhere that "it is not spoken language that is natural to man, but the faculty of constituting a language, that is, a system of distinct signs ... ," that is, the possibility of the code and of articulation, independent of any substance, for example, phonic substance.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida will prefer to follow the more "fruitful paths (formalization)" of a general semiotics without falling in what he considered "a hierarchizing teleology" privileging linguistics, and speak of 'mark' rather than of language, not as something restricted to mankind, but as prelinguistic, as the pure possibility of language, working every where there is a relation to something else.

Derrida sees these differences as elemental oppositions working in all languages, systems of distinct signs, and codes, where terms don't have absolute meanings but instead draw meaning from reciprocal determination with other terms. This structural difference is the first component that Derrida will take into account when articulating the meaning of {{lang|fr|différance}}, a mark he felt the need to create and will become a fundamental tool in his lifelong work: [[deconstruction]]:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1) {{lang|fr|Différance}} is the systematic play of differences, of the traces of differences, of the spacing by means of which elements are related to each other. This spacing is the simultaneously active and passive (the ''a'' of {{lang|fr|différance}} indicates this indecision as concerns activity and passivity, that which cannot be governed by or distributed between the terms of this opposition) production of the intervals without which the "full" terms would not signify, would not function. }}

But structural difference will not be considered without him already destabilizing from the start its static, [[Synchronic analysis|synchronic]], [[Systematics – study of multi-term systems|taxonomic]], ahistoric motifs, remembering that all [[structure]] already refers to the [[Generative systems|generative]] movement in the play of differences:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 28–30
{{quote|multiline=y|It is also the becoming-space of the spoken chain—which has been called temporal or linear; a becoming-space which makes possible both writing and every correspondence between speech and writing, every passage from one to the other.

The activity or productivity connoted by the ''a'' of {{lang|fr|différance}} refers to the generative movement in the play of differences. The latter are neither fallen from the sky nor inscribed once and for all in a closed system, a static structure that a synchronic and taxonomic operation could exhaust. Differences are the effects of transformations, and from this vantage the theme of {{lang|fr|différance}} is incompatible with the static, synchronic, taxonomic, ahistoric motifs in the concept of structure.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main component of {{lang|fr|différance}} is [[Deferral|deferring]], which takes into account the fact that meaning is not only synchrony with all the other terms inside a structure, but also [[Synchronic analysis|diachrony]], with everything that ''was'' and ''will be'' said, in History, difference as structure and deferring as genesis:&lt;ref name="Jacques Derrida 1981 pp. 28–30"&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke |first=Patrick |editor-last=Dillon |editor-first=M.

|quote=Derrida says that {{lang|fr|différance}} is removed from every possible mode of presence, like the unconscious of Freud, the force in Nietzsche, the Other in Levinas. So the question of {{lang|fr|différance}} must yield to the {{lang|fr|différance}} of the question and thus can never be asked, is forever absent. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|2) "the ''a'' of {{lang|fr|différance}} also recalls that spacing is temporization, the detour and postponement by means of which intuition, perception, consummation—in a word, the relationship to the present, the reference to a present reality, to a being—are always deferred. Deferred by virtue of the very principle of difference which holds that an element functions and signifies, takes on or conveys meaning, only by referring to another past or future element in an economy of traces. This economic aspect of {{lang|fr|différance}}, which brings into play a certain not conscious calculation in a field of forces, is inseparable from the more narrowly semiotic aspect of différance.}}

This confirms the subject as not present to itself and constituted on becoming space, in temporizing and also, as Saussure said, that "language [which consists only of differences] is not a function of the speaking subject":&lt;ref name="Jacques Derrida 1981 pp. 28–30"/&gt;
{{quote|It confirms that the subject, and first of all the conscious and speaking subject, depends upon the system of differences and the movement of différance, that the subject is not present, nor above all present to itself before différance, that the subject is constituted only in being divided from itself, in becoming space, in temporizing, in deferral; and it confirms that, as Saussure said, "language [which consists only of differences] is not a function of the speaking subject." }}

Questioned this myth of the presence of meaning in itself ("objective") and/or for itself ("subjective") Derrida will start a long deconstruction of all texts where conceptual oppositions are put to work in the actual construction of meaning and values based on the subordination of the movement of "{{lang|fr|différance}}":&lt;ref name="Jacques Derrida 1981 pp. 28–30"/&gt;
{{quote|At the point at which the concept of {{lang|fr|différance}}, and the chain attached to it, intervenes, all the conceptual oppositions of metaphysics (signifier/signified; sensible/intelligible; writing/speech; passivity/activity; etc.)—to the extent that they ultimately refer to the presence of something present (for example, in the form of the identity of the subject who is present for all his operations, present beneath every accident or event, self-present in its "living speech," in its enunciations, in the present objects and acts of its language, etc.)- become non pertinent. They all amount, at one moment or another, to a subordination of the movement of {{lang|fr|différance}} in favor of the presence of a value or a meaning supposedly antecedent to {{lang|fr|différance}}, more original than it, exceeding and governing it in the last analysis. This is still the presence of what we called above the "transcendental signified."}}

But, as Derrida also points out, these relations with other terms express not only meaning but also values. The way elemental oppositions are put to work in all texts it is not only a theoretical operation but also a practical option.
The first task of deconstruction, starting with philosophy and  afterwards revealing it operating in literary texts, juridical texts, etc., would be to overturn these oppositions:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Jean-Louis Houdebine and Guy Scarpetta," in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 42–44&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|multiline=y|On the one hand, we must traverse a phase of overturning. To do justice to this necessity is to recognize that in a classical philosophical opposition we are not dealing with the peaceful coexistence of a vis-a-vis, but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other (axiologically, logically, etc.), or has the upper hand. 

To deconstruct the opposition, first of all, is to overturn the hierarchy at a given moment. To overlook this phase of overturning is to forget the conflictual and subordinating structure of opposition.}}

It is not that the final task of deconstruction is to surpass all oppositions, because they are structurally necessary to produce sense. They simply cannot be suspended once and for all. But this does not obviate their need to be analyzed and criticized in all its manifestations, showing the way these oppositions, logical and axiological, are at work in all discourse for it to be able to produce meaning and values.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Jean-Louis Houdebine and Guy Scarpetta," in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), p. 42

{{quote|When I say that this phase is necessary, the word phase is perhaps not the most rigorous one. It is not a question of a chronological phase, a given moment, or a page that one day simply will be turned, in order to go on to other things. The necessity of this phase is structural; it is the necessity of an interminable analysis: the hierarchy of dual oppositions always reestablishes itself. Unlike those authors whose death does not await their demise, the time for overturning is never a dead letter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illustration ===
For example, the word "house" derives its meaning more as a function of how it differs from "shed", "mansion", "hotel", "building", etc. (Form of Content, which [[Louis Hjelmslev]] distinguished from Form of Expression) than how the word "house" may be tied to a certain image of a traditional house (i.e. the relationship between signifier and signified) with each term being established in reciprocal determination with the other terms than by an ostensive description or definition.

When can we talk about a "house" or a "mansion" or a "shed"? The same can be said about verbs, in all the world languages: when should we stop saying "walk" and start saying "run"? The same happens, of course, with adjectives: when must we stop saying "yellow" and start saying "orange", or stop defining as "black" and start saying "white", or "rich" and "poor", "entrepreneur" and "worker", "civilized" and "primitive", "man" and "animal", "beast" and "sovereign", "christian" and "pagan", or "beautiful" and start saying "ugly", or "bad" and start saying "good", or "truth" and start saying "false", "determined" and "free"? Or "in" and "out", "here" and "there", "now" and "then", "past" and "present" and "future" and "eternal"? Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here, but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by différance. Deferral also comes into play, as the words that occur following "house" or "white" in any expression will revise the meaning of that word, sometimes dramatically so. This is true not only with syntagmatic succession in relation with paradigmatic simultaneity, but also, in a broader sense, between diachronic succession in History related with synchronic simultaneity inside a "system of distinct signs".

Thus, complete meaning is always "differential" and postponed in language; there is never a moment when meaning is complete and total. A simple example would consist of looking up a given word in a dictionary, then proceeding to look up the words found in that word's definition, etc., also comparing with older dictionaries from different periods in time, and such a process would never end.

This is also true with all ontological oppositions and its many [[declension]]s, not only in philosophy as in human sciences in general, cultural studies, theory of Law, et cetera. For example: the intelligible and the sensible, the spontaneous and the receptive, autonomy and heteronomy, the empirical and the transcendental, immanent and transcendent, as the interior and exterior, or the founded and the founder, normal and abnormal, phonetic and writing, analysis and synthesis, the literal sense and figurative meaning in language, reason and madness in psychoanalysis, the masculine and feminine in gender theory, man and animal in ecology, the beast and the sovereign in the political field, theory and practice as distinct dominions of thought itself. In all speeches in fact (and by right) we can make clear how they were dramatized, how the cleavages were made during the centuries, each author giving it different centers and establishing different hierarchies between the terms in the opposition.

=== Paradox ===
It may seem contradictory to suggest that {{lang|fr|différance}} is neither a word nor a concept.  The difference itself between words cannot only be another word. If that is the case then {{lang|fr|différance}} appeals to ontology, creating an even bigger problem. So {{lang|fr|différance}} is either an appeal to an infinite mystery (similar to God in theology) or becomes empty of any and all meaning and is thus rendered superfluous.

== The web of language ==
We reside, according to this philosophy, in a web of language, or at least one of interpretation, that has been laid down by tradition and which shifts each time we hear or read an utterance—even if it is the same utterance.  {{lang|fr|Différance}} and [[deconstruction]] are attempts to understand this web of language, to search, in Derrida's words, for the "other of language".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kearney, Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers, Manchester: MUP, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  This "other of language" is close to what [[Anglophone Philosophy]] calls the [[Sense and reference|Reference]] of a word.  There is a ''deferment'' of meaning with each act of re-reading. There is a ''difference'' of readings with each re-reading.  In Derrida's words,  "there is nothing outside the [con]text" of a word's use and its place in the lexicon.  Text, in Derrida's parlance, refers to context and includes all about the "real-life" situation of the speech/text (cf. [[speech act]] theory).

=== Temporal delay ===
For Derrida, the relationship between the Signifier and the Signified is not understood to be exactly like Saussure's. For Derrida, there was a deferral, a continual and indefinite postponement as the Signified can never be achieved. The formation of the linguistic sign is marked by movement, and is not static. The easiest way to understand this is to imagine Saussure's model as a two dimensional plane, where each signified is separated due to the difference in its sound image. (If two sound-images are exactly alike, one could not distinguish between the two.) Each signifier then would be a particular point. Derrida adds a third dimension, time. Now, the act of formation is accounted for. This is not to say that there is no relationship between the two. However, Derrida felt that the old model focused too heavily on the signifier, rather than on utterance and occurrence. The Signifier and the Signified are severed completely and irrevocably.

=== Example of word introduction ===
An example of this effect occurred in England during the Renaissance, when oranges began to be imported from the Mediterranean.  Yellow and red came to be differentiated from a new colour term, "orange".  What was the meaning of these words before 1600? – What is their meaning afterwards?  Such effects go on often in the use of language and frequently this effect forms the basis of language/meaning.  Such changes of meaning are also often centres of political violence, as is apparent in the differences invested in male/female, master/slave, citizen/foreigner etc.  Derrida seeks to modulate and question these "violent hierarchies" through [[deconstruction]].

Perhaps it is a misconception that {{lang|fr|différance}} seeks contradictory meanings. It does not necessarily do so. It can, but what it usually describes is the re-experience, the re-arrival of the moment of reading. [[Roland Barthes]] remarked that "those who fail to reread are obliged to read the same story everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland. ''S/Z''. Trans. by Richard Miller. New York: Hill and Wang, 1974, pp. 15–6.&lt;/ref&gt; This wry comment summarizes the phenomenon of different experience for each iteration.

We are discussing just one text—every text. No distinction is necessarily made between texts in this "basic" level.  The difference/deferral can be between one text and itself, or between two texts; this is the crucial distinction between traditional perspectives and [[deconstruction]].

==Deconstruction and the history of philosophy==
Derrida's neographism (rather than [[neologism]] because "neologism" would propose a ''logos'', a metaphysical category; and (more simply) because, when uttered in French, "{{lang|fr|différance|italic=no}}" is indistinguishable from "difference"—it is thus only a graphical modification, having nothing to do with a spoken ''logos'') is, of course, not just an attempt at linguistics or to discuss written texts and how they are read.  It is, most importantly, an attempt to escape the history of [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysics]]; a history that has always prioritised certain concepts, e.g., those of substance, essence, soul, spirit (idealism), matter (realism), becoming, freedom, [[Empirical evidence|sense-experience]], language, science etc.  All such ideas imply self-presence and totality.  Différance, instead, focuses on the play of presence and absence, and, in effecting a concentration of certain thinking, Derrida takes on board the thought of [[Freud]]'s unconscious (the trace), [[Heidegger]]'s destruction of [[ontotheology]], [[Nietzsche]]'s play of forces, and [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]]'s notion of [[sacrifice]] in contrast to Hegel's {{lang|de|[[Aufheben]]}}.

{{quote|{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}} is not only irreducible to any ontological or theological—ontotheological—reappropriation, but as the very opening of the space in which [[ontotheology]]—philosophy—produces its system and its history, it includes ontotheology, inscribing it and exceeding it without return.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", ''Margins of Philosophy'', p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet he does not approach this absence and loss with the nostalgia that marks Heidegger's attempt to uncover some original truths beneath the accretions of a false metaphysics that have accumulated since Socrates.  Rather it is with the moods of play and affirmation that Derrida approaches the issue.

However, Derrida himself never claimed to have escaped from the metaphysics with what he has done. To the contrary, he criticises others for claiming to have demolished metaphysics thoroughly.

=== Negative theology ===
{{see also|Deconstruction and religion}}
Derrida's non-concept of différance, resembles, but is not, [[negative theology]], an attempt to present a tacit metaphysics without pointing to any existent essence as the [[first cause]] or transcendental signified.  Following his presentation of his paper "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}" in 1968, Derrida was faced with an annoyed participant who said, "It [différance] is the source of everything and one cannot know it: it is the God of negative theology." Derrida's answer was, "It is and it is not."&lt;ref name=Caputo&gt;Caputo, John. The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1997, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to negative theology, which posits something supereminent and yet concealed and ineffable, {{lang|fr|différance}} is not quite transcendental, never quite "real", as it is always and already deferred from being made present.  As [[John Caputo]] writes, "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}} is but a quasi-transcendental anteriority, not a supereminent, transcendental ulteriority."&lt;ref&gt;Caputo, ''Prayers and Tears'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The differences and deferrings of différance, Derrida points out, are not merely ideal, they are not inscribed in the contours of the brain nor do they fall from the sky, the closest approximation would be to consider them as historical, that is, if the word history itself did not mean what it does, the airbrushing speech of the victor/vanquished.

Derrida has shown an interest in negative or [[apophasis|apophatic]] theology, one of his most important works on the topic being his essay "Sauf le nom".&lt;ref name=Sauf&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "{{lang|fr|Sauf le nom|italic=no}}". On the Name. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and technics ==
In ''[[Of Grammatology]]'', Derrida states that grammatology is not a "science of man" because it is concerned with the question of "the name of man." This leads Derrida into a consideration of the work of [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and in particular his concepts of "program," "exteriorisation," and "liberation of memory." Derrida writes: "Leroi-Gourhan no longer describes the unity of man and the human adventure thus by the simple possibility of the {{lang|fr|graphie}} in general; rather as a stage or an articulation in the history of life—of what I have called différance—as the history of the {{lang|fr|grammè}}."&lt;ref name=Grammatology&gt;Derrida, Jacques. ''Of Grammatology'', Baltimore &amp; London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida thus explicitly refers the term {{lang|fr|différance}} to life, and in particular to life as the history of inscription and retention, whether this is genetic or technological (from writing to "electronic card indexes"). And thus grammatology is not a science of man because it deconstructs any anthropocentrism, in the sense that the inscription in question falls on both sides of the divide human/non-human.

Yet, in the article "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", Derrida refers {{lang|fr|différance}} not to ''physis'', that is, ''life'', but to "all the others of ''physis''—''tekhnè'', ''nomos'', ''thesis'', society, freedom, history, mind, etc.—as ''physis'' differed and deferred, or as ''physis'' differing and deferring."&lt;ref name=Margins&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", ''Margins of Philosophy'', Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press, 1982, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Stiegler]] argues in his book, ''[[Technics and Time, 1]]'', that this represents a hesitation in Derrida: "Now phusis as life was already différance. There is an indecision, a passage remaining to be thought. At issue is the specificity of the temporality of life in which life is inscription in the nonliving, spacing, temporalisation, differentiation, and deferral by, of and in the nonliving, in the dead."&lt;ref name=Technics&gt;Stiegler, Bernard. ''[[Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, pp. 139–40.&lt;/ref&gt; What this suggests to Stiegler is that grammatology—a logic of the {{lang|fr|grammè}}—must be supplemented with a history of grammatisation, a history of all the forms and techniques of inscription, from genetics to technics, each stage of which will be found to possess its own logic. Only in this way can {{lang|fr|différance}} be thought as the differing and deferral ''of'' life (life as the emergence of a difference from non-life, specifically as the deferral of [[entropy]]), ''and'' as the difference ''from'' ''physis'' through which the human must inevitably be defined (the human as the inauguration of ''another'' memory, neither the memory of genetics nor that of the individual, but rather a memory consisting in "inscription in the nonliving," that is, ''technical'' memory).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6049">'''Ellipsoidal coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \mu, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; that generalizes the two-dimensional [[elliptic coordinates|elliptic coordinate system]].  Unlike most three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]]s that feature [[quadratic function|quadratic]] [[coordinate surfaces]], the ellipsoidal coordinate system is based on [[Confocal quadrics|confocal quadrics]].

==Basic formulae==

The Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; can be produced from the ellipsoidal coordinates 
&lt;math&gt;( \lambda, \mu, \nu )&lt;/math&gt; by the equations

:&lt;math&gt;
x^{2} = \frac{\left( a^{2} + \lambda \right) \left( a^{2} + \mu \right) \left( a^{2} + \nu \right)}{\left( a^{2} - b^{2}  \right) \left( a^{2} - c^{2} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y^{2} = \frac{\left( b^{2} + \lambda \right) \left( b^{2} + \mu \right) \left( b^{2} + \nu \right)}{\left( b^{2} - a^{2}  \right) \left( b^{2} - c^{2} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z^{2} = \frac{\left( c^{2} + \lambda \right) \left( c^{2} + \mu \right) \left( c^{2} + \nu \right)}{\left( c^{2} - b^{2}  \right) \left( c^{2} - a^{2} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the following limits apply to the coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;
- \lambda &lt; c^{2} &lt; - \mu &lt; b^{2} &lt; -\nu &lt; a^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; are [[ellipsoid]]s

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} + \lambda} +  \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2} + \lambda} + \frac{z^{2}}{c^{2} + \lambda} = 1,
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; are [[hyperboloid]]s of one sheet

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} + \mu} +  \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2} + \mu} + \frac{z^{2}}{c^{2} + \mu} = 1,
&lt;/math&gt;

because the last term in the lhs is negative, and surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; are [[hyperboloid]]s of two sheets
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} + \nu} +  \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2} + \nu} + \frac{z^{2}}{c^{2} + \nu} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

because the last two terms in the lhs are negative.

The orthogonal system of quadrics used for the ellipsoidal coordinates are [[Confocal quadrics|confocal quadrics]].

==Scale factors and differential operators==

For brevity in the equations below, we introduce a function

:&lt;math&gt;
S(\sigma) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \left( a^{2} + \sigma \right) \left( b^{2} + \sigma \right) \left( c^{2} + \sigma \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can represent any of the three variables &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \mu, \nu )&lt;/math&gt;.  
Using this function, the scale factors can be written
 
:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \lambda - \mu \right) \left( \lambda - \nu\right)}{S(\lambda)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\mu} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \mu - \lambda\right) \left( \mu - \nu\right)}{S(\mu)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\nu} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \nu - \lambda\right) \left( \nu - \mu\right)}{S(\nu)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = \frac{\left( \lambda - \mu \right) \left( \lambda - \nu \right) \left( \mu - \nu\right)}{8\sqrt{-S(\lambda) S(\mu) S(\nu)}} \  d\lambda d\mu d\nu
&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Laplacian]] is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = 
\frac{4\sqrt{S(\lambda)}}{\left( \lambda - \mu \right) \left( \lambda - \nu\right)}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} \left[ \sqrt{S(\lambda)} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \lambda} \right] \  +  &lt;/math&gt;
:::::&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{4\sqrt{S(\mu)}}{\left( \mu - \lambda \right) \left( \mu - \nu\right)}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \left[ \sqrt{S(\mu)} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \mu} \right] \  + \  
\frac{4\sqrt{S(\nu)}}{\left( \nu - \lambda \right) \left( \nu - \mu\right)}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \nu} \left[ \sqrt{S(\nu)} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \nu} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \mu, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

{{Progressivism}}

'''Environmental justice''' emerged as a concept in the United States in the early 1980s. The term has two distinct uses with the more common usage describing a [[social movement]] that focuses on the fair distribution of environmental benefits and burdens.  The other use is an interdisciplinary body of social science literature that includes theories of the environment and justice, environmental laws and their implementations, environmental policy and planning and governance for development and sustainability, and political ecology.&lt;ref name="Schlosberg"&gt;Schlosberg, David. (2007) ''Defining Environmental Justice: Theories, Movements, and Nature''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller, Jr. |first=G. Tyler |title=Environmental Science: Working With the Earth |edition=9th |year=2003 |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Pacific Grove, California |isbn=0-534-42039-7 |page=G5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] defines environmental justice as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. EPA has this goal for all communities and persons across this Nation{{sic}}. It will be achieved when everyone enjoys the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards and equal access to the decision-making process to have a healthy environment in which to live, learn, and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Justice|publisher=U.S. EPA|url=http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/|accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other definitions include: equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits; fair and meaningful participation in environmental decision-making; recognition of community ways of life, local knowledge, and cultural difference; and the capability of communities and individuals to function and flourish in society.&lt;ref name="Schlosberg"/&gt; An alternative meaning, used in social sciences, of the term "justice" is "the distribution of social goods".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral and Political Reasoning in Environmental Practice|last=Schlosberg|first=David|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0262621649|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental discrimination==

Environmental discrimination is one issue that environmental justice seeks to address. [[Racism]] and [[discrimination]] against minorities center on a socially-dominant group's belief in its superiority, often resulting in privilege for the dominant group and the mistreatment of non-dominant minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Racism|url=http://www.pollutionissues.com/Ec-Fi/Environmental-Racism.html|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined impact of these privileges and prejudices are just one of the potential reasons that waste management and high pollution sites tend to be located in minority-dominated areas. A disproportionate quantity of minority communities (for example in [[Warren County, North Carolina|Warren County]], [[North Carolina]]) play host to landfills, incinerators, and other potentially toxic facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skelton|first=Renee|title=The Environmental Justice Movement|url=http://www.nrdc.org/ej/history/hej.asp|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental discrimination can also be the placement of a harmful factory in a place of minority. This can be seen as environmental discrimination because it is placing a harmful entity in a place where the people often don't have the means to fight back against big corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor|last=Lerner|first=Steve|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental discrimination has historically been evident in the process of selecting and building environmentally hazardous sites, including [[waste disposal]], [[manufacturing]], and energy production facilities. The location of transportation infrastructures, including highways, ports, and airports, has also been viewed as a source of environmental injustice. Among the earliest documentation of environmental racism was a study of the distribution of toxic waste sites across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Chavis, Benjamin F., Goldman, Benjamin A. and Charles Lee. (1987) Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States: A National Report on the Racial and Socio-economic Characteristics of Communities with Hazardous Waste Sites. Commission for Racial Justice, United Church of Christ.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the results of that study, waste dumps and waste incinerators have been the target of environmental justice lawsuits and protests.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Luke and Sheila R. Foster. (2001) From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement. New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===

Some environmental justice lawsuits are based on violations of [[civil rights]] laws.&lt;ref name="Section 602 Lawsuits"&gt;{{Cite journal

Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is often used in lawsuits that claim environmental inequality. Section 601 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin by any government agency receiving federal assistance. To win an environmental justice case that claims an agency violated this statute, the plaintiff must prove the agency intended to discriminate. Section 602 requires agencies to create rules and regulations that uphold section 601. This section is useful because the plaintiff must only prove that the rule or regulation in question had a discriminatory impact. There is no need to prove discriminatory intent. ''Seif v. Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living'' set the precedent that citizens can sue under section 601. There has not yet been a case in which a citizen has sued under section 602, which calls into question whether this right of action exists.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

The [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was used many times to defend minority rights during the 1960s, has also been used in numerous environmental justice cases.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

==Initial barriers to minority participation==

When [[environmentalism]] first became popular during the early 20th century, the focus was wilderness protection and wildlife preservation. These goals reflected the interests of the movement's initial supporters. The actions of many mainstream environmental organizations still reflect these early principles.&lt;ref name="Sandler, R. 2007 pp. 27-55"&gt;Sandler, R., &amp; Phaedra, P. (2007). Environmental justice and environmentalism. (pp. 27-55).&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous low-income minorities felt isolated or negatively impacted by the movement, exemplified by the Southwest Organizing Project's (SWOP) Letter to the Group of 10, a letter sent to major environmental organizations by several local environmental justice activists.&lt;ref&gt;"SWOP Letter to the Group of 10 ." Southwest Organizing Project. N.p.. Web. 7 May 2013. &lt;[http://www.swop.net/node/26]&gt;. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514131800/http://www.swop.net/node/26 |date=May 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter argued that the environmental movement was so concerned about cleaning up and preserving nature that it ignored the negative side-effects that doing so caused communities nearby, namely less job growth.&lt;ref name="Sandler, R. 2007 pp. 27-55"/&gt; In addition, the [[NIMBY]] movement has transferred [[locally unwanted land use]]s (LULUs) from middle-class neighborhoods to poor communities with large minority populations. Therefore, vulnerable communities with fewer political opportunities are more often exposed to hazardous waste and toxins.&lt;ref name="NIMBY Victims"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in the [[PIBBY]] principle, or at least the PIMBY (Place-in-minorities'-backyard), as supported by the United Church of Christ's study in 1987.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"&gt;{{Cite journal

{{anchor|Environmental elitism}}
As a result, some minorities have viewed the environmental movement as elitist. Environmental elitism manifested itself in three different forms:

# ''Compositional''&amp;nbsp;– Environmentalists are from the middle and upper class.
# ''Ideological''&amp;nbsp;– The reforms benefit the movement's supporters but impose costs on nonparticipants.
# ''Impact''&amp;nbsp;– The reforms have "regressive social impacts". They disproportionately benefit environmentalists and harm underrepresented populations.&lt;ref name="Environmental elitism"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of economic growth have taken advantage of environmentalists' neglect of minorities. They have convinced minority leaders looking to improve their communities that the economic benefits of industrial facility and the increase in the number of jobs are worth the health risks. In fact, both politicians and businesses have even threatened imminent job loss if communities do not accept hazardous industries and facilities. Although in many cases local residents do not actually receive these benefits, the argument is used to decrease resistance in the communities as well as avoid expenditures used to clean up pollutants and create safer workplace environments.&lt;ref name="Job Blackmail"&gt;{{Cite news

===Cost barriers===
{{Original research|section|date=January 2013}}
One of the prominent barriers to minority participation in environmental justice is the initial costs of trying to change the system and prevent companies from dumping their toxic waste and other pollutants in areas with high numbers of minorities living in them. There are massive legal fees involved in fighting for environmental justice and trying to shed environmental racism. For example, in the United Kingdom, there is a rule that the claimant may have to cover the fees of their opponents, which further exacerbates any cost issues, especially with lower income minority groups; also, the only way for environmental justice groups to hold companies accountable for their pollution and breaking any licensing issues over waste disposal would be to sue the government for not enforcing rules. This would lead to the forbidding legal fees that most could not afford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=Elisabeth|title=What price environmental justice?|url=http://www.environmentalistonline.com/article/2011-03-09/what-price-environmental-justice|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen by the fact that out of 210 judicial review cases between 2005 and 2009, 56% did not proceed due to costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost Barriers to Environmental Justice|url=http://us.practicallaw.com/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1247269202785&amp;ssbinary=true|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions of the Civil Rights Movement==

During the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s, activists participated in a social movement that created a unified atmosphere and advocated goals of social justice and equality. The community organization and the social values of the era have translated to the Environmental Justice movement.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

===Similar goals and tactics===

The Environmental Justice movement and the Civil Rights Movement have many commonalities. At their core, the movements' goals are the same: "social justice, equal protection, and an end to institutional discrimination."  By stressing the similarities of the two movements, it emphasizes that environmental equity is a right for all citizens. Because the two movements have parallel goals, it is useful to employ similar tactics that often emerge on the grassroots level. Common confrontational strategies include protests, neighborhood demonstrations, picketing, political pressure, and demonstration.&lt;ref name="African American Community"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existing organizations and leaders===

Just as the civil rights movement of the 1960s began in the South, the fight for environmental equity has been largely based in the South, where environmental discrimination is most prominent. In these southern communities, black churches and other voluntary associations are used to organize resistance efforts, including research and demonstrations, such as the protest in Warren County, North Carolina. As a result of the existing community structure, many church leaders and civil rights activists, such as Reverend [[Benjamin Chavis Muhammad]], have spearheaded the Environmental Justice movement.&lt;ref name="African American Community"/&gt;

[[The Bronx]], in New York City, has become a recent example of Environmental Justice succeeding. [[Majora Carter]] spearheaded the [[South Bronx Greenway]] Project, bringing local economic development, local [[urban heat island]] mitigation, positive social influences, [[Open Space Accessibility in California|access to public open space]], and aesthetically stimulating environments. The [[New York City Department of Design and Construction]] has recently recognized the value of the South Bronx Greenway design, and consequently utilized it as a widely distributed smart growth template. This venture is the ideal [[shovel-ready]] project with over $50 million in funding.&lt;ref name="southbronx"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===

Several of the most successful Environmental Justice lawsuits are based on violations of civil rights laws. The first case to use civil rights as a means to legally challenge the siting of a waste facility was in 1979. With the legal representation of Linda McKeever Bullard, the wife of Robert D. Bullard, residents of Houston's Northwood Manor opposed the decision of the city and Browning Ferris Industries to construct a solid waste facility near their mostly African-American neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Section 602 Lawsuits" /&gt;

In 1979, Northeast Community Action Group, or NECAG, was formed by African American homeowners in a suburban, middle income neighborhood in order to keep a landfill out of their home town. This group was the first organization that found the connection between race and pollution. The group, alongside their attorney Linda McKeever Bullard started the lawsuit Bean v. Southwestern Waste Management, Inc., which was the first of its kind to challenge the sitting of a waste facility under civil rights law.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Bullard, "Solid Waste Sites and the Black Houston Community," Sociological Inquiry 53 (Spring 1983): 273-288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, Robert. "Dismantling Toxic Racism." Crisis 1 July 2007: 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was used many times to defend minority rights during the 1960s, has also been used in numerous Environmental Justice cases.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is often used in lawsuits that claim environmental inequality. The two most paramount sections in these cases are sections 601 and 602. Section 601 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin by any government agency receiving federal assistance. To win an Environmental Justice case that claims an agency violated this statute, the plaintiff must prove the agency intended to discriminate. Section 602 requires agencies to create rules and regulations that uphold section 601; in ''[[Alexander v.

Among the affected groups of Environmental Justice, those in high-poverty and racial minority groups have the most propensity to receive the harm of environmental injustice. Poor people account for more than 20% of the human health impacts from industrial toxic air releases, compared to 12.9% of the population nationwide.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Racial/Ethnic Inequality in Environmental-Hazard Exposure in Metropolitan Los Angeles Manuel Pastor, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not account for the inequity found among individual minority groups. Some studies that test statistically for effects of race and ethnicity, while controlling for income and other factors, suggest racial gaps in exposure that persist across all bands of income.&lt;ref&gt;Justice in the Air: Tracking Toxic Pollution from America's Industries and Companies to Our States, Cities, and Neighborhoods Michael Ash, {{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/justice/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725114107/http://www.peri.umass.edu/justice/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

African-Americans are affected by a variety of Environmental Justice issues. One notorious example is the "[[Cancer Alley]]" region of Louisiana. This 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans is home to 125 companies that produce one quarter of the petrochemical products manufactured in the United States. The [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] has concluded that the African-American community has been disproportionately affected by Cancer Alley as a result of Louisiana's current state and local permit system for hazardous facilities, as well as their low socio-economic status and limited political influence.&lt;ref name="Shrader-Frechette 2002"&gt;Shrader-Frechette. 2002. ''Environmental Justice Creating Equality, Reclaiming Democracy''. Oxford University Press: New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; Another incidence of long-term environmental injustice occurred in the "West Grove" community of Miami, Florida. From 1925 to 1970, the predominately poor, African American residents of the "West Grove" endured the negative effects of exposure to carcinogenic emissions and toxic waste discharge from a large trash incinerator called Old Smokey.&lt;ref&gt;Alfieri, Anthony Victor, Paternalistic Interventions in Civil Rights and Poverty Law: A Case Study of Environmental Justice (November 14, 2013). Michigan Law Review, Vol. 112; University of Miami Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2014-3. Available at SSRN: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ssrn.com/abstract=2354382&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Despite official acknowledgement as a public nuisance, the incinerator project was expanded in 1961. It was not until the surrounding, predominantly white neighborhoods began to experience the negative impacts from Old Smokey that the legal battle began to close the incinerator.

Indigenous groups are often the victims of environmental injustices. [[Uranium mining and the Navajo people|Native Americans have suffered abuses related to uranium mining]] in the American West. Churchrock, New Mexico, in Navajo territory was home to the longest continuous uranium mining in any Navajo land. From 1954 until 1968, the tribe leased land to mining companies who did not obtain consent from Navajo families or report any consequences of their activities. Not only did the miners significantly deplete the limited water supply, but they also contaminated what was left of the Navajo water supply with uranium. Kerr-McGee and United Nuclear Corporation, the two largest mining companies, argued that the Federal Water Pollution Control Act did not apply to them, and maintained that Native American land is not subject to environmental protections. The courts did not force them to comply with US clean water regulations until 1980.&lt;ref name="Shrader-Frechette 2002"/&gt;

The most common example of environmental injustice among Latinos is the exposure to pesticides faced by farmworkers. After DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides were banned in the United States in 1972, farmers began using more acutely toxic organophosphate pesticides such as [[parathion]]. A large portion of farmworkers in the US are working as undocumented immigrants, and as a result of their political disadvantage, are not able to protest against regular exposure to pesticides or benefit from the protections of Federal laws.&lt;ref name="Shrader-Frechette 2002"/&gt; Exposure to chemical pesticides in the cotton industry also affects farmers in India and Uzbekistan. Banned throughout much of the rest of the world because of the potential threat to human health and the natural environment, [[Endosulfan]] is a highly toxic chemical, the safe use of which cannot be guaranteed in the many developing countries it is used in. [[Endosulfan]], like DDT, is an organochlorine and persists in the environment long after it has killed the target pests, leaving a deadly legacy for people and wildlife.&lt;ref name="ejfoundation.org"&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219205051/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html |date=February 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of cities along the US-Mexico border are also affected. [[Maquiladora]]s are assembly plants operated by American, Japanese, and other foreign countries, located along the US-Mexico border. The maquiladoras use cheap Mexican labor to assemble imported components and raw material, and then transport finished products back to the United States. Much of the waste ends up being illegally dumped in sewers, ditches, or in the desert. Along the Lower [[Rio Grande Valley]], maquiladoras dump their toxic wastes into the river from which 95 percent of residents obtain their drinking water. In the border cities of [[Brownsville, Texas]] and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros, Mexico]], the rate of [[anencephaly]] (babies born without brains) is four times the national average.&lt;ref name=bullard&gt;Bullard, Robert D.

States may also see placing toxic facilities near poor neighborhoods as preferential from a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) perspective. A CBA may favor placing a toxic facility near a city of 20,000 poor people than near a city of 5,000 wealthy people.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, R., &amp; Phaedra, P. (2007).

It has been argued that environmental justice issues generally tend to affect women in communities more so than they affect men. This is due to the way that women typically interact more closely with their environments at home, such as through handling food preparation and childcare. Women also tend to be the leaders in environmental justice activist movements. Despite this, it tends not to be considered a mainstream feminist issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Karen|year=2016|title=Bread and Roses: A Gender Perspective on Environmental Justice and Public Health|url=|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.3390/ijerph13101005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government agencies==

===U.S. Department of Agriculture===

In its 2012 environmental justice strategy documents, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) stated an ongoing desire to integrate environmental justice into its core mission, internal operations and programming. It identified ambitious timeframes for action and promised improved efforts to highlight, track and coordinate EJ activities among its many sub-agencies. Agency-wide the USDA expanded its perspective on EJ, so that in addition to preventing disproportionate environmental impacts on EJ communities, USDA voiced a commitment to improve public participation processes and use its technical and financial assistance programs to improve the quality of life in all communities. In 2011, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack emphasized the USDA's focus on EJ in rural communities around the United States. USDA funds or implements many creative programs with social and environmental equity goals, however it has no staff dedicated solely to EJ, and faces the challenges of limited budgets and coordinating the efforts of a highly diverse agency.

====Background====

The USDA is the executive agency responsible for federal policy on food, agriculture, [[natural resources]], and [[quality of life]] in rural America.&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;USDA, Mission Statement, {{cite web |url=http://usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=MISSION_STATEMENT |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701232252/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=MISSION_STATEMENT |archivedate=2012-07-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The USDA has more than 100,000 employees and delivers over $96.5 billion in public services to programs worldwide.&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;USDA, Performance and Accountability Report at ii, http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/mimedetector?url=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf&amp;text=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100505073828/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/mimedetector?url=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf&amp;text=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf |date=2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill its general mandate, USDA's departments are organized into seven mission areas:1) Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services; 2) Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services; 3) Food Safety; 4) Marketing and Regulatory Programs; 5) Natural Resources and Environment; 6) Research, Education and Economics and; 7) Rural Development.&lt;ref name="ftn3"&gt;USDA, Mission Areas, http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_MISSION_AREAS&amp;navtype=RT&amp;parentnav=AGENCIES_OFFICES.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations." Executive Order 12898 requires that achieving EJ must be part of each federal agency's mission. Agency programs, policies and activities can lead to health and environmental effects that disproportionately impact minority and low-income populations. Under Executive Order 12898 agencies must develop strategies that identify and address these effects by:

# promoting enforcement of all health and environmental statutes in areas with minority and low-income populations&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# ensuring greater [[public participation]]&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# improving research and data collection relating to the health and environment of minority and low-income populations&lt;nowiki&gt;; &lt;/nowiki&gt;and
# identifying differential patterns of [[resource consumption|consumption of natural resources]] among minority and low-income populations.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that federal funds be used in a fair and equitable manner. Under Title VI any federal agency that receives federal funding cannot discriminate. Title VI also forbids federal agencies from providing grants or funding opportunities to programs that discriminate. An agency that violates Title VI can lose its federal funding.

Following E.O. 12898 and USDA's initial EJ strategic plan, USDA issued its internal Environmental Justice Department Regulation (DR 5600-002) in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002,{{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the definition of EJ was undergoing updates in 2012, DR 5600-002 defines environmental justice as "to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, all populations are provided the opportunity to comment before decisions are rendered on, are allowed to share in the benefits of, are not excluded from, and are not affected in a disproportionately high and adverse manner by, government programs and activities affecting human health or the environment."&lt;ref name="ftn5"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 4,{{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Holmes, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment at USDA, notes that this definition will be broadened in 2012 so that EJ also includes efforts to improve quality of life in all communities.&lt;ref name="ftn6"&gt;Patrick Homes, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment at USDA, interview with Shannon Kay Little(May 1, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, USDA will consider EJ to include avoiding adverse impacts ''and'' ensuring access to environmental benefits. Further, DR 5600-002 identified USDA's goals in implementing Executive Order 12898 as:

* To incorporate environmental justice considerations into USDA's programs and activities and to address environmental justice across mission areas&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* To identify, prevent, and/or mitigate, to the greatest extent practicable, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of USDA programs and activities on minority and low-income populations&lt;nowiki&gt;; &lt;/nowiki&gt;and
* To provide, to the greatest extent practicable, the opportunity for minority and low-income populations to participate in planning, analysis, and decisionmaking that affects their health or environment, including identification of program needs and designs.&lt;ref name="ftn7"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 5, .&lt;/ref&gt;

DR 5600-002 is "intended only to improve the internal management of USDA," and although it described concrete, mandatory actions by the agency, it did not establish new rights or benefits enforceable in court.&lt;ref name="ftn66"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 13, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has stated a more concrete priority to fulfill its mission of environmental justice in rural areas.&lt;ref name="ftn60"&gt;Secretary Vilsack, State of Environmental Justice Speech, http://irjci.blogspot.com/2011/04/vilsack-those-interested-in.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012 Environmental Justice Strategy====

In compliance with the August 2011 Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Justice and Executive Order 12898 (MOU), USDA released a final Environmental Justice Strategic Plan: 2012 to 2014 on February 7, 2012 (Strategic Plan), which identifies new and updated goals and performance measures beyond what USDA identified in a 1995 EJ strategy it adopted in response to E.O. 12898.&lt;ref name="ftn10"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same week, it also released its first annual implementation progress report (Progress Report), as the MOU also required.&lt;ref name="ftn11"&gt;USDA, Progress Report, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary's message accompanying the Strategic Plan described two immediate tasks: 1) each agency within USDA is required to identify a point of contact for EJ issues, at the Senior Executive Service (SES) level; and 2) each agency must develop its own EJ strategy prior to April 15, 2012, and begin implementing it as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="ftn31"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 3, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2012, it did not appear that such strategies had been made public, although sub-agencies provided internal reports to the USDA's EJ steering committee on April 9, 2012, according to Holmes.&lt;nowiki&gt; The Secretary's message contained strong language that, "Given that USDA programs touch almost every American every day, the Department is well positioned to help in [the environmental justice] effort."&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn31"/&gt; USDA has determined that it can achieve the requirements of the Executive Order by integrating EJ into its programs, rather than implementing new and costly programs.&lt;ref name="ftn14"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 4, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The agency took this same approach in an EJ strategy it adopted in 1995.&lt;ref name="ftn15"&gt;USDA, 1995 Strategy at 3, {{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111061339/http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, such as agricultural chemicals and effects to migrant workers, USDA reviews its practices to identify potential disproportionate, adverse impacts on EJ communities, according to Blake Velde, Senior Environmental Scientist with the USDA Hazardous Materials Management Division.&lt;ref name="ftn16"&gt;Blake Velde, Senior Environmental Scientist with the USDA Hazardous Materials Management Division, interview with Shannon Kay Little (April 25, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, however, USDA believes its existing technical and financial assistance programs provide solutions to environmental inequity, such as its initiatives on education, food deserts, and economic development in impacted communities, and ensuring access to environmental benefits is the focus of USDA's EJ efforts.

Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Under Secretary Harris Sherman is the political appointee generally responsible for USDA's EJ strategy, with Patrick Holmes, a senior staffer to the Under Secretary, playing a coordinating role. Although USDA has no staff dedicated solely to EJ, its sub-agencies have many offices dedicated to civil rights compliance, outreach and communication and environmental review whose responsibilities incorporate EJ issues.&lt;ref name="ftn68"&gt;Holmes interview.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strategic Plan was developed with the input of an Environmental Justice Working Group, made up of staff and leadership representing the USDA's seven mission areas and the SES-level contacts, which were appointed in early 2012, serve as a steering committee for the agency's efforts.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; The Strategic Plan is organized according to six goals, which were purposefully left broad, and lists specific objectives and agency performance measures under each goal. The details and specific implementation of many of these programs and the performance measures are left to the departments and sub-agencies to develop.&lt;ref name="ftn19"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 5, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The six goals are to:

* Ensure USDA programs provide opportunities for EJ communities.
* Provide targeted training and capacity-building to EJ communities.
* Expand public participation in agency activities, to enhance the "credibility and public trust" of the USDA.
* Ensure USDA's activities do not have disproportionately high and adverse human health impacts, and resolve environmental justice issues and complaints.
* Increase the awareness of EJ issues among USDA employees.
* Update and/or Develop Departmental and Agency Regulations on EJ.

The Strategic Plan also lists existing programs that either currently support the goal, or are expected to in the future. According to Holmes, some of the challenges of the Strategic Plan process have stemmed from the diverse programs and missions that the agency serves, limitations on staff time, and budgets.&lt;ref name="ftn20"&gt;Holmes interview. With regards to budgets, Holmes noted that in April 2012 the USDA's Programs for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers, which provides loans to women, African Americans, American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for farm and ranch property purchases, improvements and soil and water conservation projects, was facing a loss of its entire $75 million budget in the Farm Bill.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental Justice initiatives====

The Strategic Plan requires that EJ must be integrated into the strategies and evaluations for sub-agencies' technical and financial assistance programs.&lt;ref name="ftn34"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 5, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; It also emphasizes public participation, community capacity-building, EJ awareness and training within the USDA.

=====Transparency, accountability, accessibility and community participation=====

A stated goal of USDA's Strategic Plan is to expand public participation in agency activities, to enhance the "credibility and public trust" of the USDA.&lt;ref name="ftn22"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 9, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the agency will update its public participation guidelines to include EJ, beginning this process by April 15, 2012. The Strategic Plan emphasizes capacity-building in EJ communities, and includes objectives that emphasize communication between USDA and environmental justice communities, including Tribal consultation. Sub-agencies must announce schedules for training programs in EJ communities and to develop new, preliminary outreach materials on USDA programs by April 15, 2012.&lt;ref name="ftn23"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 7, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional performance standard is to encourage EJ communities to participate in the NEPA process, an effort the Strategic Plan requires on or before February 29, 2012,&lt;ref name="ftn24"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 10, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; although the Strategic Plan does not articulate a standard by which this could be measured. The Strategic Plan also reiterates compliance with the Executive Orders on Tribal consultation and outreach to non-proficient English speakers, and seeks more diverse representation on regional forest advisory committees. [community participation, outreach]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Generally, the USDA's process for developing the Strategic Plan demonstrates a commitment to public involvement. The USDA EJ documents are currently housed obscurely within the Departmental Management section of the USDA website, under the Hazardous Materials Management Division, although the agency plans to update its entire site in 2012 and create a more robust EJ page.&lt;ref name="ftn25"&gt;USDA, Brownfields Environmental Justice, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/brownfields.htm&lt;nowiki&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226175222/http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/brownfields.htm |date=February 26, 2012 }}; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Velde interview.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strategic Plan was released in draft form in December 2011 for a 30-day public comment period, and responses to general types of comments received are in the Progress Report, although the comments themselves are not online.&lt;ref name="ftn26"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 3-7, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary's message accompanying the Strategic Plan requests that organizations and individuals to continue to contact USDA with comments on the Strategic Plan and to identify USDA programs that have been the most beneficial to their communities.&lt;ref name="ftn31"/&gt; The agency has a dedicated email address for this purpose. Agency leadership has asked its sub-agencies to prepare responses to additional comments that have been received, and the agency will release an interim progress report, prior to winter 2013.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[community participation, outreach, education]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=====Internal evaluation and training=====

The Strategic Plan also seeks to increase the awareness of environmental justice issues among USDA employees.&lt;ref name="ftn29"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 12-13, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strategic Plan does not list any existing programs in this area, but does list a series of performance measures going forward, most of which must be met by April 15, 2012. The measures include environmental justice trainings, new web pages, and potential revisions to staff manuals and handbooks. Sub-agencies began reviewing their existing training in 2012 and in their April 9, 2012 reports to the USDA EJ steering committee, sub-agencies were asked to describe their goals for enhanced EJ training.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; This internal, educational undertaking appears to be new in the 2012 Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan targets Responsible Officials, meaning office and program managers, for the trainings, as well as the SES-level points of contact required by the Secretary's message. [education, study, compliance and enforcement]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The EJ Strategy tasked each sub-agency with developing its own EJ strategy document by spring 2012, although as of May 2012 the sub-agencies were still in an evaluation stage and had not issued final documents.&lt;ref name="ftn31"/&gt; For many sub-agencies, the 2012 process has been their first focused assessment of their EJ impact and opportunities.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; Going forward, sub-agencies will submit twice-yearly reports to NRE about their implementation of the Strategic Plan's goals; the first of these was due April 9, 2012, and as of May 2012, the USDA's EJ steering committee was evaluating the first reports.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;

=====Establishment of performance metrics=====

As part of its effort to ensure that EJ communities have the opportunity to participate in USDA programs, the Strategic Plan requires each sub-agency to set measurements through which it can track increased EJ community participation in USDA technical and financial assistance programs.&lt;ref name="ftn34"/&gt; This must be done by April 15, 2012. As of late April 2012, the sub-agencies were still in the process of describing a baseline of current activities and determining the metrics to evaluate improvement, such as staff time, grant funding or increased programming.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; The ultimate metrics are likely to be somewhat subjective, and must be flexible given the broad range of undertakings by the sub-agencies.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; Also related to evaluation, the Strategic Plan requires the sub-agencies to determine an effective methodology with which they can evaluate whether USDA programs have disproportionate impacts.&lt;ref name="ftn37"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 11, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [study, redressing environmental racism, compliance and enforcement]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=====Other EJ initiatives=====

======Tribal outreach======

USDA has had a role in implementing Michelle Obama's ''Let's Move'' campaign in Tribal Areas, by increasing participation by Bureau of Indian Education schools in Federal nutrition programs, in the development of community gardens on Tribal lands, and in the development of Tribal food policy councils.&lt;ref name="ftn38"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This is combined with measures to provide Rural Development funding for community infrastructure in Indian Country.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [children's issues, education, diet, grants, Native Americans, public health].&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) is working to update its policy on protection and management of Native American Sacred Sites, an effort that has included listening sessions and government-to-government consultation.&lt;ref name="ftn78"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 10, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has also consulted with Tribes regarding management of reintroduced of species, where Tribes may have a history of subsistence-level hunting of those species. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is exploring a program to use meat from bisons raised on Tribal land to supply AMS food distribution programs to Tribes.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [Native Americans, diet, subsistence, community participation]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The Intertribal Technical Assistance Network works to improve access of Tribal governments, communities and individuals to USDA technical assistance programs.&lt;ref name="ftn50"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 8, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

======Technical and financial assistance to farmers======

The Progress Report highlights the NRCS Strike Force Initiative, which has identified impoverished counties in Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas to receive increased outreach and training regarding USDA assistance programs. USDA credits this increased outreach with generating a 196 percent increase in contracts, representing more than 250,000 acres of farmland, in its Environmental Quality Incentives Program.&lt;ref name="ftn50"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [economic benefit, equitable development, grants, outreach, ej as evaluation criteria] NRCS works with &lt;/nowiki&gt;"private landowners protect their natural resources"&lt;ref name="ftn44"&gt;USDA, NRCS EJ Guidance at 1, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1045586.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; through conservation planning and assistance with the goal of maintaining "productive lands and healthy ecosystems."&lt;ref name="ftn45"&gt;USDA, About NRCS, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/about NRCS.&lt;/ref&gt; NRCS has its own civil rights compliance guidance document, and in 2001 NRCS funded and published a study, "Environmental Justice: Perceptions of Issues, Awareness and Assistance," focused on rural, Southern "Black Belt" counties and analyzing how the NRCS workforce could more effectively integrate environmental justice into impacted communities.&lt;ref name="ftn46"&gt;USDA, NRCS EJ Guidance, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1045586.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [compliance and enforcement, redressing environmental racism, grants, study, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The Farm Services Agency in 2011 devoted $100,000 of its Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers program budget to improving its outreach to counties with persistent poverty, including improving its materials and building relationships with local universities and community groups.&lt;ref name="ftn47"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 9, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [economic benefit, equitable development, grants, outreach, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In addition, USDA's Risk Management Agency has initiated education and outreach to low-income farmers regarding use of biological controls, rather than pesticides, for pest control, efforts that the agency believes are valuable in the face of climate change.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [climate change, agricultural chemicals, education]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

======Green jobs and capacity building======

A 2011 MOU between a USDA sub-agency, the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) and the American Indian Science and Engineering Society that aims to increase the number of Native Americans entering the FSIS career path;&lt;ref name="ftn49"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 9, [http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [education, community participation, economic benefit, green jobs, Native Americans, diet, interagency collaboration]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

A partnership between APHIS and the Rural Coalition (Coalicion)--an alliance of regionally and culturally diverse organizations working to build a more just and sustainable food system. The partnership focuses on outreach, fair returns to minority and other small farmers and rural communities, farmworker working conditions, environmental protection and food safety.&lt;ref name="ftn50"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [agricultural chemicals, community participation, diet, economic benefit, outreach, improving health and safety, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

USFS is also funding pilot initiatives, such as its Urban Water Ambassadors, summer internship positions for youth who coordinate and implement urban tree planting projects.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; In 2011, USFS provided a grant to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources that funded 14 summer jobs for youth in Baltimore to work on urban watershed restoration programs.&lt;ref name="ftn52"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 8-9, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [community participation, green jobs, mapping, water]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

======Mapping======

USFS has established several Urban Field Stations, to research urban natural resources' structure, function, stewardship, and benefits.&lt;ref name="ftn54"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 6, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; By mapping urban tree coverage, the agency hopes to identify and prioritize EJ communities for urban forest projects.&lt;ref name="ftn54"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [community education, mapping, diet, improving health and safety, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Another initiative highlighted by the agency is the Food and Nutrition Service and Economic Research Service's Food Desert Locator.&lt;ref name="ftn55"&gt;USDA, Food Desert Locator, http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/FoodDesert/.&lt;/ref&gt; The Locator provides a spatial view of food deserts, defined as a low-income census tract where a substantial number or share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery store. It also shows, by census tract, the number and percentage of certain populations, such as children, seniors, or households without a vehicle, with low access to grocery stores. The mapped deserts can be used to direct agency resources to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables and other food assistance programs, according to Blake Velde, an agency scientist and spokesperson on EJ issues.&lt;ref name="ftn56"&gt;Velde interview.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [diet, mapping, improving health and safety, study, ej as evaluation criteria, services and data available to others]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

======Rural outreach======

USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has placed a clear emphasis on supporting EJ in rural areas.&lt;ref name="ftn60"/&gt; Although&lt;nowiki&gt; "often the highest profile battles on [environmental justice] issue[s] are waged in at-risk neighborhoods in major cities or at Superfund sites located near populated urban and &lt;/nowiki&gt;suburban areas" Vilsack highlighted the often overlooked rural areas where environmental justice is largely ignored.&lt;ref name="ftn60"/&gt;

Through its Rural Utilities Service, the USDA supports a number of Water and Environmental Programs. These programs work to administer water and wastewater loans or grants to rural areas and cities to support water and wastewater, stormwater and solid waste disposal systems, including SEARCH grants that are targeted to financially distressed, small rural communities and other opportunities specifically for Alaskan Native villages and designated Colonias.;&lt;ref name="ftn59"&gt;USDA, Water and Environmental Programs Fact Sheet, {{cite web|url=http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/SupportDocuments/RUS%20Fact%20Sheet%201806%20new.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625211242/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/SupportDocuments/RUS%20Fact%20Sheet%201806%20new.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USDA, Water and Environmental Programs Website, http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/UWEP_HomePage.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, Secretary Vilsack said that the USDA funded 2,575 clean water projects in rural areas during a two-year period to address problems ranging from wastewater treatment to sewage treatment.&lt;ref name="ftn60"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [water, land use, compliance and enforcement, improving health and safety, pollution cleanup, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The USDA also supports the Rural Energy for America Grant Program. This program provides grants and loans to farmers, ranchers and rural small businesses to finance renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements.&lt;ref name="ftn61"&gt;USDA, Rural Energy Grants, {{cite web |url=http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/busp/9006grant.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620054541/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/busp/9006grant.htm |archivedate=2012-06-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[grants, economic benefit, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====Regulations or Formalized EJ Guidelines====

In 1997 the USDA promulgated a departmental regulation providing "direction to&lt;nowiki&gt; [&lt;/nowiki&gt;sub-]agencies for integrating environmental justice considerations into USDA programs and activities" (DR 5600-002).&lt;ref name="ftn62"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 1, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Issuance of this regulation was a primary goal of USDA's 1995 EJ strategy document.&lt;ref name="ftn63"&gt;USDA, 1995 Strategy at 4, {{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111061339/http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; DR 5600-002 includes guidelines for consideration of EJ in the NEPA process, but also stated that "efforts to address environmental justice are not limited to NEPA compliance."&lt;ref name="ftn64"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 6.b., {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It requires evaluation of activities for potential disproportionate EJ impacts, outreach, and performance-metric based evaluation and reporting on sub-agencies' implementation of EJ goals.&lt;ref name="ftn65"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Secs. 6-10, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; DR 5600-002 is a forward-looking, permanent directive that applies to all USDA programs and activities. However, it was not published in the Federal Register as a formal rulemaking and does not create a private right of action or enforcement tool.&lt;ref name="ftn66"/&gt; A Strategic Plan goal is to update this regulation, as well as other departmental regulations and policies on EJ.&lt;ref name="ftn67"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 13,[http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan].&lt;/ref&gt; According to USDA, the EJ definition in DR 5600-002 will be modified in 2012—EJ to include measures to avoid disproportionate negative impacts as well as quality-of-life improvements that the agency believes can benefit impacted communities.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;

The Strategic Plan also has established a performance standard requiring that existing and new USDA regulations are evaluated for EJ impacts or benefits.&lt;ref name="ftn69"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 11,[http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan].&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-agencies are required to develop a process for this evaluation by April 15, 2012. This performance standard reflects a requirement in DR 5600-002 that required the USDA departmental regulation on rulemaking, DR 1521-1, to be revised to require an EJ evaluation in the rulemaking process.&lt;ref name="ftn70"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 11, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, DR 1521-1 requires that a cost-benefit analysis of major human health, safety and environmental regulations include analysis of risks to "persons who are disproportionately exposed or particularly sensitive," although DR 1521-1 does not mention EJ or impacts to minority or low-income communities explicitly.&lt;ref name="ftn71"&gt;USDA, DR 1521-1, Sec. 6.c(3), http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR1521-001.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[Land Use - permitting, community participation, compliance and enforcement, study]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====Enforcement====

The Strategic Plan sets an enforcement-specific goal, which includes objectives to "effectively resolve or adjudicate all environmental justice-related Title VI complaints" and to include environmental justice as a key component of civil rights compliance reviews.&lt;ref name="ftn72"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 11, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; Agencies are also required to identify an assessment methodology by April 15, 2012, which can be used to determine whether programs have disproportionately high and adverse environmental and human health impacts. The NRCS has published and updated a Civil Rights Compliance Review Guide, which guides the NRCS Civil Rights Division's review of the compliance with Title VI and 12898 in the agency's state offices, field offices and other facilities.&lt;ref name="ftn73"&gt;USDA, NRCS Civil Rights Compliance Guide at 4, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1046364.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The guide was updated in November 2011 and it does not mention EJ explicitly.&lt;ref name="ftn74"&gt;USDA, NRCS Civil Rights Compliance Guide, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1046364.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Strategic Plan identifies the NRCS compliance review and other outreach and research programs as supporting its EJ enforcement goals.&lt;ref name="ftn75"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 12, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [compliance and enforcement]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====NEPA====

The 1997 Regulation, DR 5600-2 required USDA sub-agencies to develop their own NEPA environmental justice guidance documents.&lt;ref name="ftn76"&gt;USDA, DR5600-2, Sec. 8, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-agencies have done so, with some additional details, such as a reminder that the EJ community should be involved in identifying the alternatives, suggested stakeholders and resources, and guidance to hold meetings at times when working people can get to them, and to translate notices.&lt;ref name="ftn77"&gt;USDA, RUS Environmental Guidance at 44, 67, {{cite web|url=http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/me/Misc/1794A-602.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224000332/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/me/Misc/1794A-602.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-24 |df= }} Guidance.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when DR 5600-02 is updated as required by the Strategic Plan, changes could be made to the NEPA section of the Regulation. The Strategic Plan sets a performance standard to encourage interested environmental justice communities to be involved in the public participation process for NEPA documents, although the Strategic Plan does not require updates to the NEPA portions of DR 5600-02.&lt;ref name="ftn78"/&gt;

Although the USDA has integrated EJ into each step of the NEPA process as required by Executive Order 12898, many of the NEPA documents completed by the USDA include only cursory analysis of environmental justice effects. This analysis most often includes a rote paragraph as to what Executive Order 12898 requires and a quick conclusion that the agency action does not affect minority and low-income populations. Some examples where the USDA included more in-depth analysis are:

* Descriptions of the minority and low-income populations that live in the study area&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn79"&gt;USDA, NRCS Logan Canal EJ Analysis, {{cite web |url=http://www.ut.nrcs.usda.gov/programs/EWP/LNCRP/data/Draft_EIS/Chapters/Appendices/7_LNCR-DEIS_appC4-demographics.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218170717/http://www.ut.nrcs.usda.gov/programs/EWP/LNCRP/data/Draft_EIS/Chapters/Appendices/7_LNCR-DEIS_appC4-demographics.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Impacts relevant to socio-economic environment including changes in employment and income variations in the distribution of social welfare.&lt;ref name="ftn80"&gt;USDA, USFS Lassen EIS, http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5109835.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [&lt;/nowiki&gt;community participation, education, outreach, ej as evaluation criteria]

====Permitting====

The USDA does not have any permitting initiatives specific to EJ.

====Title VI====

The USDA has an Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights whose mission it is to provide leadership and direction "for the fair and equitable treatment of all USDA customers."&lt;ref name="ftn81"&gt;USDA, OASCR Website, http://www.ascr.usda.gov/.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the USDA revised DR 4300-4, internal regulations requiring a Civil Rights Impact Analysis of all "policies, actions or decisions" affecting the USDA's federally conducted and federally assisted programs or activities.&lt;ref name="ftn82"&gt;USDA, DR4300-4, Sec. 3.b., {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625183740/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis is used to determine the "scope, intensity, direction, duration, and significance of the effects of an agency's proposed ... policies, actions or decisions."&lt;ref name="ftn83"&gt;USDA, DR4300-4, Sec. 3.c., {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625183740/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; USDA's departmental regulation on EJ, DR 5600-002, required DR 4300-4 to be revised to "require that Civil Rights Impact Analyses include a finding as to whether proposed or new actions have or do not have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on the human health or the environment of minority populations, and whether such effects can be prevented or mitigated".&lt;ref name="ftn84"&gt;USDA, DR5600-002, Sec. 11, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although DR 4300-4 was revised in 2003, the revised regulation does not explicitly require a finding on adverse environmental or health impacts. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;study, compliance and enforcement]

===Right-to-know movement===
{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}
A new movement, bent on educating the people, was born after the [[Bhopal disaster]], called the "[[Right to know|right-to-know]]" movement. A series of laws and reports was created, all built to inform the people of the [[pollutant]]s being dumped into our{{Who|date=August 2015}} neighborhoods and atmosphere, and exactly how much of each chemical is being exposed and dumped. The theory behind "right-to-know" is that once people are informed on what is polluting their neighborhood, then they will begin to take action in both bringing down their own emissions, as well as begin to make the companies causing the most pollution, through means such as protests, to take into account their actions.

====Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act of 1986====
After the [[Bhopal disaster]], where a Union Carbide plant released forty tons of [[methyl isocyanate]] into the atmosphere in a village just south of Bhopal, India, the U.S. government passed the [[Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act of 1986]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/epcra/what-epcra|title=What is EPCRA?|work=epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced by Henry Waxman, the act required all corporations to report their toxic chemical pollution annually, which was then gathered into a report known as the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program|title=Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program|work=epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program|url=http://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program|website=epa.gov|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By collecting this data, the government was able to make sure that companies were no longer releasing excessive amounts of deadly toxins into populated areas, so to prevent another incident like that of the thousands of people killed and the tens of thousands of people injured in the Bhopal disaster.

====Corporate Toxics Information Report====
The Corporate Toxics Information Project (CTIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|title=PERI: Corporate Toxics Information Project|work=umass.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629000817/http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|archivedate=2015-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Toxics Information Project|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|website=PERI|publisher=Political Economy Research Institute|accessdate=27 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629000817/http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|archivedate=29 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded on the guidelines that they will "[develop] and [disseminate] information and analysis on corporate releases of pollutants and the consequences for communities". The overarching goal was to help take corporations into account for their pollution habits, by collecting information and putting it in databases so to make it available to the general public. The four goals of the project were to develop 1) corporate rankings, 2) regional reports, based on state, region, and metropolitan areas, 3) industry reports, based on industrial sectors, and 4) to create a web-based resource open to the entire population, that can depict all the collected data. The data collection would be done by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA|url=http://www.epa.gov/|website=epa.gov|publisher=EPA|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then analyzed and disseminated by the PERI institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peri.umass.edu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest projects of CTIP was the Toxic 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |title=PERI: Archive: Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index |work=umass.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629013855/http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |archivedate=2015-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxics 100 |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |website=PERI |publisher=Political Economy Research Institute |accessdate=27 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629013855/http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |archivedate=29 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toxic 100 is an index of the top 100 air polluters around the United States in terms of the country's largest corporations. The list is based on the EPA's Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI), which "assesses the chronic human health risk from industrial toxic releases", as well as the [[Toxics Release Inventory]] (TRI), which is where the corporations must report their chemical releases to the US government. Since its original publishing date in 2004, the Toxic 100 has been updated four more times, with the latest publishing date being August 2013.

{{Green politics sidebar |Related}}

In recent years environmental justice campaigns have also emerged in other parts of the world, such as India, South Africa, Israel, Nigeria, Mexico, Hungary, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. In Europe for example, there is evidence to suggest that the [[Romani people]] and other minority groups of non-European descent are suffering from environmental inequality and discrimination.&lt;ref name="capacity.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/snapshot_for_ej.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920234947/http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/snapshot_for_ej.pdf |date=September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Making the Case for Environmental Justice in Central and Eastern Europe|last = Steger, T.

===Europe===
''For further information, see [[Environmental racism in Europe]]''

In Europe, the [[Romani people]]s are ethnic minorities and differ from the rest of the European people by their culture, language, and history. The environmental discrimination that they experience ranges from the unequal distribution of environmental harms as well as the unequal distribution of education, health services and employment. In many countries Romani peoples are forced to live in the slums because many of the laws to get residence permits are discriminatory against them. This forces Romani people to live in urban "ghetto" type housing or in shantytowns. In the Czech Republic and Romania, the Romani peoples are forced to live in places that have less access to running water and sewage, and in Ostrava, Czech Republic, the Romani people live in apartments located above an abandoned mine, which emits methane. Also in Bulgaria, the public infrastructure extends throughout the town of Sofia until it reaches the Romani village where there is very little water access or sewage capacity.&lt;ref name="Steger, 2008"&gt;Steger, Tamara and Richard Filcak. 2009. ''Articulating the basis for Promoting Environmental Justice in Central and Eastern Europe''. Environmental Justice: Volume 1, Number 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union is trying to strive towards environmental justice by putting into effect declarations that state that all people have a right to a healthy environment. The Stockholm Declaration, the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission]]'s Report&amp;nbsp;– "[[Our Common Future]]", the [[Rio Declaration]], and Article 37 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], all are ways that the Europeans have put acts in place to work toward environmental justice.&lt;ref name="Steger, 2008"/&gt; Europe also funds action-oriented projects that work on furthering Environmental Justice throughout the world. For example, '''EJOLT''' ('''Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade''') is a large multinational project supported through the FP7 Science in Society budget line from the [[European Commission]].{{Elucidate|date=March 2012}} From March 2011 to March 2015, 23 civil society organizations and universities from 20 countries in Europe, Africa, Latin-America, and Asia are, and have promised to work together on advancing the cause of Environmental Justice.

====Sweden====

Sweden became the first country to ban [[Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane|DDT]] in 1969 due to the efforts of women protesting its usage in forests. In the 1980s, women activists organized around preparing jam made from pesticide-tainted berries, which they offered to the members of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWEZCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA293&amp;ots=vwscYvzeSK&amp;dq=sweden%20jam%20berries%20pesticides&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=sweden&amp;f=false|title=Women Pioneers For The Environment|last=Breton|first=Mary Joy|date=2016-02-01|publisher=Northeastern University Press|isbn=9781555538552|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Radical Ecology: The Search for a Livable World|last=Merchant|first=Carolyn|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=978-0415935784|location=New York, NY|pages=193|quote=In Sweden, feminists prepare jam from berries sprayed with herbicides and offer a taste to members of parliament: they refuse.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament members refused, and this has often been cited as an example of direct action within [[ecofeminism]].

====United Kingdom====

Whilst the predominant agenda of the Environmental Justice movement in the United States has been tackling issues of race, inequality, and the environment, environmental justice campaigns around the world have developed and shifted in focus. For example, the EJ movement in the United Kingdom is quite different. It focuses on issues of poverty and the environment, but also tackles issues of [[health inequalities]] and [[social exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/environmental_justice.pdf|format=PDF|title=Environmental justice: Rights and means to a healthy environment for all|publisher=ESRC Global Environmental Change Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UK-based NGO, named the [[Environmental Justice Foundation]], has sought to make a direct link between the need for environmental security and the defense of basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejfoundation.org/page231.html |title=About Us |publisher=Environmental Justice Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907052127/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page231.html |archivedate=2012-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have launched several high profile campaigns that link environmental problems and social injustices. A campaign against illegal, unreported and unregulated ([[IUU]]) fishing highlighted how 'pirate' fisherman are stealing food from local, artisanal fishing communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/08/pirate-fishing-eco-disaster-report "Pirate fishing causing eco disaster and killing communities, says report"] The Guardian, June 8th 2009, retrieved 8th October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EJF. 2005. Pirates and Profiteers: How Pirate Fishing Fleets are Robbing People and Oceans. Environmental Justice Foundation, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; They have also launched a campaign exposing the environmental and human rights abuses involved in cotton production in [[Uzbekistan]]. [[Cotton produced in Uzbekistan]] is often [[harvested by children]] for little or no pay. In addition, the mismanagement of water resources for crop irrigation has led to the near eradication of the [[Aral Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejfoundation.org/page142.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410221416/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page142.html |archivedate=2010-04-10 |df= }}"Cotton in Uzbekistan: Environmental Justice Foundation"&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Justice Foundation has successfully petitioned large retailers such as [[Wal-mart]] and [[Tesco]] to stop selling [[Uzbek cotton]].&lt;ref name="Mathiason"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/24/retail-ethicalbusiness | title=Uzbekistan forced to stop child labor | work=[[The Observer]] | date=May 24, 2009 | accessdate=May 14, 2016 | author=Mathiason, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Building of alternatives to climate change====

In [[France]], numerous [[Alternatiba, Village of Alternatives|Alternatiba]] events, or villages of alternatives, are providing hundreds of alternatives to [[climate change]] and lack of environmental justice, both in order to raise people's awareness and to stimulate behaviour change. They have been or will be organized in over sixty different French and European cities, such as [[Bilbao]], [[Brussels]], [[Geneva]], [[Lyon]] or [[Paris]].

===South Africa===

Under colonial and [[apartheid]] governments in South Africa, thousands of black South Africans were removed from their ancestral lands to make way for game parks. Earthlife Africa was formed in 1988 (www.earthlife.org.za), making it Africa's first environmental justice organisation. In 1992, the Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF), a nationwide umbrella organization designed to coordinate the activities of environmental activists and organizations interested in social and environmental justice, was created. By 1995, the network expanded to include 150 member organizations and by 2000, it included over 600 member organizations.&lt;ref name=southafrica/&gt;

With the election of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in 1994, the environmental justice movement gained an ally in government. The ANC noted "poverty and environmental degradation have been closely linked" in South Africa.{{Attribution needed|date=March 2012}} The ANC made it clear that environmental inequalities and injustices would be addressed as part of the party's post-apartheid reconstruction and development mandate. The new South African Constitution, finalized in 1996, includes a Bill of Rights that grants South Africans the right to an "environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being" and "to have the environment protected, for the benefit of present and future generations through reasonable legislative and other measures that
#prevent pollution and ecological degradation;
#promote conservation; and
#secure [[ecologically sustainable development]] and use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development".&lt;ref name=southafrica&gt;McDonald, David A. Environmental Justice in South Africa. Cape Town: Ohio UP, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa's mining industry is the largest single producer of [[solid waste]], accounting for about two-thirds of the total waste stream.{{Vague|date=March 2012}} Tens of thousands of deaths have occurred among mine workers as a result of accidents over the last century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} There have been several deaths and debilitating diseases from work-related illnesses like [[asbestosis]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} For those who live next to a mine, the quality of air and water is poor. Noise, dust, and dangerous equipment and vehicles can be threats to the safety of those who live next to a mine as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These communities are often poor and black and have little choice over the placement of a mine near their homes. The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] introduced a new Minerals Act that began to address environmental considerations by recognizing the health and safety concerns of workers and the need for land rehabilitation during and after mining operations. In 1993, the Act was amended to require each new mine to have an Environmental Management Program Report (EMPR) prepared before breaking ground. These EMPRs were intended to force mining companies to outline all the possible environmental impacts of the particular mining operation and to make provision for environmental management.&lt;ref name=southafrica/&gt;

In October 1998, the Department of Minerals and Energy released a White Paper entitled ''A Minerals and Mining Policy for South Africa'', which included a section on Environmental Management. The White Paper states "Government, in recognition of the responsibility of the State as custodian of the nation's natural resources, will ensure that the essential development of the country's mineral resources will take place within a framework of sustainable development and in accordance with national environmental policy, norms, and standards". It adds that any environmental policy "must ensure a cost-effective and competitive mining industry."&lt;ref name=southafrica/&gt;

===Australia===

In Australia, the "Environmental Justice Movement" is not defined as it is in the United States. Australia does have some discrimination mainly in the siting of hazardous waste facilities in areas where the people are not given proper information about the company. The injustice that takes place in Australia is defined as environmental politics on who get the unwanted waste site or who has control over where factory opens up. The movement towards equal environmental politics focuses more on who can fight for companies to build, and takes place in the parliament; whereas, in the United States Environmental Justice is trying to make nature safer for all people.&lt;ref name="Arcioni, 2005"&gt;Arcioni, Elisa and Mitchell, Glenn(2005).''Environmental Justice in Australia: When RATS became IRATE''. Environmental Politics. Volume 14 Issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecuador===

An example of the environmental injustices that indigenous groups face can be seen in the [[Chevron-Texaco incident]] in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. [[Texaco]], which is now Chevron, found oil in Ecuador in 1964 and built sub-standard oil wells to cut costs.&lt;ref name="chevrontoxico1"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rainforest Chernobyl|url=http://chevrontoxico.com/about/rainforest-chernobyl/|publisher=ChevronToxico|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deliberately used inferior technology to make their operations cheaper, even if detrimental to the local people and environment. After the company left in 1992, they left approximately one thousand [[toxic waste]] pits open and dumped billions of gallons of toxic water into the rivers.&lt;ref name="chevrontoxico1"/&gt;

===South Korea===

[[South Korea]] has a relatively short history of environmental justice compared to other countries in the west. As a result of rapid [[industrialization]], people started to have awareness on pollution, and from the environmental discourses the idea of environmental justice appeared. The concept of environmental justice appeared in South Korea in late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article%3D2941%26context%3Detd |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040456/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2941&amp;context=etd |archivedate=2015-04-24 |df= }}''Lee, Hosuk.(2009) Political Ecology of Environmental Justice : Environmental struggle &amp; Injustice in the Yeongheung island Coal Plant Controversy. The Florida State University DigiNole Commons'', Accessed 2015-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea experienced rapid economic growth (which is commonly referred to as the '[[Miracle on the Han River]]') in the 20th century as a result of industrialization policies adapted by [[Park Chung-hee]] after 1970s. The policies and social environment had no room for environmental discussions, which aggravated the pollution in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aks.ac.kr/home/index.do]''The Academy of Korean Studies : Economy'', Accessed 2015-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental movements in South Korea started from [[air pollution]] campaigns. As the notion of environment pollution spread, the focus on environmental activism shifted from existing pollution to preventing future pollution, and the organizations eventually started to criticize the government policies that are neglecting the environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=572765&amp;cid=46634&amp;categoryId=46634]''The Academy of Korean Studies : Environmental Movement'', Accessed 2015-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of environmental justice was introduced in South Korea among the discussions of environment after 1990s. While the environmental organizations analyzed the condition of pollution in South Korea, they noticed that the environmental problems were inequitably focused especially on regions where people with low social and economic status were concentrated.

The problems of environmental injustice have arisen by environment related organizations, but approaches to solve the problems were greatly supported by the government, which developed various policies and launched institution. These actions helped raise awareness of environmental justice in South Korea. Existing environment policies were modified to cover environmental justice issues.

Environmental justice began to be widely recognized in the 1990s through policy making and researches of related institutions. For example, the [[Ministry of Environment]], which was founded in 1992, launched Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) to raise awareness of the problem and figure out appropriate plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/bgreen-activism-and-civil-society-south-korea-b]''Green Activism and Civil Society in South Korea (2002)'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of its activities, Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) held Environmental Justice forum in 1999, to gather and analyze the existing studies on the issue which were done sporadically by various organizations. Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) started as a small organization, but it is keep growing and expanding. In 2002, CMEJ had more than 5 times the numbers of members and 3 times the budget it had in the beginning year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040456/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2941&amp;context=etd]''Lee, Hosuk.(2009) Political Ecology of Environmental Justice : Environmental struggle &amp; Injustice in the Yeongheung island Coal Plant Controversy. The Florida State University DigiNole Commons", Accessed 2015-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eco.or.kr/about/]''CMEJ website'', Accessed 2015-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental injustice is still an ongoing problem. One example is the construction of [[Saemangeum Seawall]]. The construction of Saemangeum Seawall, which is the world's longest dyke (33 kilometers) runs between [[Yellow Sea]] and [[Saemangeum]] estuary, was part of a government project initiated in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://earth.esa.int/web/earth-watching/historical-views/content/-/article/saemangeum-dam-south-korea]''Earth Watching : Saemangeum Dam'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The project raised concerns on the destruction of ecosystem and taking away the local residential regions. It caught the attention of environmental justice activists because the main victims were low-income fishing population and their future generations. This is considered as an example of environmental injustice which was caused by the execution of exclusive development-centered policy.

The construction of [[Seoul-Incheon canal]] also raised environmental justice controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/02/117_39362.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111063056/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/02/117_39362.html |archivedate=2016-01-11 |df= }}''The Korea Times : Seoul-Incheon Canal Construction Kicks Off (2009)'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction took away the residential regions and farming areas of the local residents. Also, the environment worsened in the area because of the appearance of wet fogs which was caused by water deprivation and local climate changes caused by the construction of canal. The local residents, mostly people with weak economic basis, were severely affected by the construction and became the main victims of such environmental damages. While the socially and economically weak citizens suffered from the environmental changes, most of the benefits went to the industries and conglomerates with political power.

Construction of [[Factory|industrial complex]] was also criticized in the context of environmental justice. The conflict in Wicheon region is one example. The region became the center of controversy when the government decided to build industrial complex of dye houses, which were formerly located in [[Daegu]] metropolitan region. As a result of the construction, [[Nakdong River]], which is one of the main rivers in South Korea, was contaminated and local residents suffered from environmental changes caused by the construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreascience.or.kr/search/articlepdf_ocean.jsp?url=http://ocean.kisti.re.kr/downfile/volume/kenss/KHGGB3/1996/v5n3/KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297.pdf&amp;admNo=KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297]''Koreascience : A Policy Study to Preserve the Water Quality through the Activation of Local Autonomy'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kfem.or.kr/wp-content/uploads/1997/08/data_envinfo_einter_179_casestudy-on-Environmental-Issue-in-Korea.doc&amp;prev=search]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''Choony, Kim. (1997) The Case Study of Environmental issues in Korea'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental justice is a growing issue in South Korea. Although the issue is not yet widely recognized compared to other countries, many organizations beginning to recognize the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yongin.eco.or.kr/main/main.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904005259/http://yongin.eco.or.kr/main/main.php |archivedate=2015-09-04 |df= }}''Yongin Environmental Justice website'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between Northern and Southern countries===

Environmental discrimination in a global perspective is also an important factor when examining the Environmental Justice movement. Even though the Environmental Justice movement began in the United States, the United States also contributes to expanding the amount of environmental injustice that takes place in less-developed countries.&lt;ref name="Clapp"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clapp |first=Jennifer |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/dunnweb/rprnts.2005.10.10Clapp.pdf |title=Distance of Waste: Overconsumption in a Global Economy |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605171715/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/dunnweb/rprnts.2005.10.10Clapp.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies in the United States and in other developed nations around the world contribute to the injustice by shipping the toxic waste and byproducts of factories to less-developed countries for disposal. This act increases the amount of waste in the third world countries, most of which do not have proper sanitation for their own waste much less the waste of another country. Often, the people of the less-developed countries are exposed to toxins from this waste and do not even realize what kind of waste they are encountering or the health problems that could come with it.&lt;ref name="Pellow, 2007"&gt;[[David Naguib Pellow|Pellow, David Naguib]]. 2007. ''Resisting Global Toxics''. The MIT Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

One prominent example of northern countries shipping their waste to southern countries took place in [[Haiti]]. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had ash from the incineration of toxic waste that they did not have room to dump. Philadelphia decided to put the ash into the hands of a private company, which shipped the ash and dumped it in various other parts of the world, outside of the United States. ''[[Khian Sea waste disposal incident|The Khian Sea]]'', the ship the ash was put on, sailed around the world and many countries would not accept the waste because it was hazardous for the environment and the people. The ship owners finally dumped the waste, labeled Fertilizer, in Haiti, on the beach, and sailed away in the night. The government of Haiti was infuriated and called for the waste to be removed, but the company would not come to take the ash away. The fighting over who was responsible for the waste and who would remove the waste went on for many years. After debating for over ten years, the waste was removed and taken back to a site just outside Philadelphia to be disposed of permanently.&lt;ref name="Pellow, 2007"/&gt;

The reason that this transporting of waste from Northern countries to the Southern countries takes place is because it is cheaper to transport waste to another country and dump it there, than to pay to dump the waste in the producing country because the third world countries do not have the same strict industry regulations as the more developed countries. The countries that the waste is taken to are usually impoverished and the governments have little or no control over the happenings in the country or do not care about the people.&lt;ref name="Park, 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Transnational movement networks===

Many of the Environmental Justice Networks that began in the United States expanded their horizons to include many other countries and became Transnational Networks for Environmental Justice. These networks work to bring Environmental Justice to all parts of the world and protect all citizens of the world to reduce the environmental injustice happening all over the world. Listed below are some of the major Transnational Social Movement Organizations.&lt;ref name="Pellow, 2007"/&gt;

*Basel Action Network – works to end toxic waste dumping in poor undeveloped countries from the rich developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ban.org/ |title=Basel Action Network |publisher=BAN |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*GAIA (Global Anti-Incinerator Alliance) – works to find different ways to dispose of waste other than incineration. This company has people working in over 77 countries throughout the world.
*GR (Global Response) – works to educate activists and the upper working class how to protect human rights and the ecosystem.
*[[Greenpeace International]] – which was the first organization to become the global name of Environmental Justice. Greenpeace works to raise the global consciousness of transnational trade of toxic waste.
*Health Care without Harm – works to improve the public health by reducing the environmental impacts of the health care industry.&lt;ref&gt;https://noharm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
*International Campaign for Responsible Technology – works to promote corporate and government accountability with electronics and how the disposal of technology affect the environment.
*[[International POPs Elimination Network]] – works to reduce and eventually end the use of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs) which are harmful to the environment.
*PAN (Pesticide Action Network) – works to replace the use of hazardous pesticides with alternatives that are safe for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.panna.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2012}}
In [[computer science]], '''evolutionary computation''' is a family of [[algorithm]]s for [[global optimization]] inspired by [[biological evolution]], and the subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[soft computing]] studying these algorithms. In technical terms, they are a family of population-based [[trial and error]] problem solvers with a [[metaheuristic]] or [[stochastic optimization]] character.

In evolutionary computation, an initial set of candidate solutions is generated and iteratively updated. Each new generation is produced by stochastically removing less desired solutions, and introducing small random changes. In biological terminology, a [[population]] of solutions is subjected to [[natural selection]] (or [[artificial selection]]) and [[mutation]]. As a result, the population will gradually [[evolution|evolve]] to increase in [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], in this case the chosen [[fitness function]] of the algorithm.

Evolutionary computation techniques can produce highly optimized solutions in a wide range of problem settings, making them popular in [[computer science]]. Many variants and extensions exist, suited to more specific families of problems and data structures. Evolutionary computation is also sometimes used in [[evolutionary biology]] as an ''in silico'' experimental procedure to study common aspects of general evolutionary processes.

== History ==
The use of evolutionary principles for automated problem solving originated in the 1950s. It was not until the 1960s that three distinct interpretations of this idea started to be developed in three different places.

''[[Evolutionary programming]]'' was introduced by [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] in the US, while [[John Henry Holland]] called his method a ''[[genetic algorithm]]''. In Germany [[Ingo Rechenberg]] and [[Hans-Paul Schwefel]] introduced ''[[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]]''. These areas developed separately for about 15 years. From the early nineties on they are unified as different representatives ("dialects") of one technology, called ''evolutionary computing''. Also in the early nineties, a fourth stream following the general ideas had emerged – ''[[genetic programming]]''. Since the 1990s, nature-inspired algorithms are becoming an increasingly significant part of the evolutionary computation.

These terminologies denote the field of evolutionary computing and consider evolutionary programming, evolution strategies, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming as sub-areas.

Simulations of [[evolution]] using [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and [[artificial life]] started with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli in the 1960s, and was extended by [[Alex Fraser (scientist)|Alex Fraser]], who published a series of papers on simulation of [[artificial selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fraser AS |title=Monte Carlo analyses of genetic models |journal=Nature |volume=181 |issue=4603 |pages=208–9 |year=1958 |pmid=13504138 |doi=10.1038/181208a0 |ref=harv|bibcode=1958Natur.181..208F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary algorithm|Artificial evolution]] became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of [[Ingo Rechenberg]] in the 1960s and early 1970s, who used [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] to solve complex engineering problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rechenberg |first=Ingo |year=1973 |title=Evolutionsstrategie&amp;nbsp;– Optimierung technischer Systeme nach Prinzipien der biologischen Evolution (PhD thesis) |publisher=Fromman-Holzboog|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s in particular became popular through the writing of [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland |first=John H. |year=1975 |title=Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn = 0-262-58111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As academic interest grew, dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications, including the automatic evolution of computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koza|first=John R. |year=1992 |title=Genetic Programming: On the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection|publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=0-262-11170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers, and also to optimise the design of systems.&lt;ref&gt;G.

== Techniques ==
Evolutionary computing techniques mostly involve [[metaheuristic]] [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] [[algorithm]]s. Broadly speaking, the field includes:

*[[Ant colony optimization]]
*[[Artificial immune system]]s
*[[Artificial life]] (also see [[digital organism]])
*[[Cultural algorithm]]s
*[[Differential evolution]]
*[[Dual-phase evolution]]
*[[Estimation of distribution algorithm]]s

*[[Self-organization]] such as [[self-organizing map]]s, [[competitive learning]]
*[[Swarm intelligence]]

== Evolutionary algorithms ==
{{Main article|Evolutionary algorithm}}
[[Evolutionary algorithms]] form a subset of evolutionary computation in that they generally only involve techniques implementing mechanisms inspired by [[biological evolution]] such as [[reproduction]], [[mutation]], [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], [[natural selection]] and [[survival of the fittest]]. [[Candidate solutions]] to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the [[Loss function|cost function]] determines the environment within which the solutions "live" (see also [[fitness function]]). [[Evolution]] of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

In this process, there are two main forces that form the basis of evolutionary systems:  '''Recombination''' and '''mutation''' create the necessary diversity and thereby facilitate novelty, while '''selection''' acts as a force increasing quality.

Many aspects of such an evolutionary process are [[stochastic]]. Changed pieces of information due to recombination and mutation are randomly chosen. On the other hand, selection operators can be either deterministic, or stochastic. In the latter case, individuals with a higher [[Fitness function|fitness]] have a higher chance to be selected than individuals with a lower [[Fitness function|fitness]], but typically even the weak individuals have a chance to become a parent or to survive.

== Evolutionary algorithms and biology ==
{{Main article|Evolutionary algorithm}}

[[Genetic algorithms]] deliver methods to model [[biological systems]] and [[systems biology]] that are linked to the theory of [[dynamical systems]], since they are used to predict the future states of the system. This is just a vivid (but perhaps misleading) way of drawing attention to the orderly, well-controlled and highly structured character of development in biology.

However, the use of algorithms and informatics, in particular of [[computational theory]], beyond the analogy to dynamical systems, is also relevant to understand evolution itself. 

This view has the merit of recognizing that there is no central control of development; organisms develop as a result of local interactions within and between cells. The most promising ideas about program-development parallels seem to us to be ones that point to an apparently close analogy between processes within cells, and the low-level operation of modern computers &lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-biological/#InfEvo &lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, biological systems are like computational machines that process input information to compute next states, such that biological systems are closer to a computation than classical dynamical system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= J.G. Diaz Ochoa |title= Elastic Multi-scale Mechanisms: Computation and Biological Evolution |journal=[[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=47–57 |year=2018 |pmid=29248946 |doi=10.1007/s00239-017-9823-7 |ref=harv|bibcode=2018JMolE..86...47D }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Furthermore, following concepts from [[computational theory]], micro processes in biological organisms are fundamentally incomplete and undecidable ([[completeness (logic)]]), implying that “there is more than a crude metaphor behind the analogy between cells and computers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= A. Danchin |title= Bacteria as computers making computers |journal=[[FEMS Microbiol. Rev.]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=3–26 |year=2008 |pmid=29248946 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00137.x |ref=harv|bibcode= |pmc=2704931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The analogy to computation extends also to the relationship between [[inheritance systems]] and biological structure, which is often thought to reveal one of the most pressing problems in explaining the origins of life.

An '''explanandum''' (a [[Latin]] term) is a sentence describing a [[phenomenon]] that is to be [[explanation|explained]], and the '''explanans''' are the sentences adduced as explanations of that phenomenon. For example, one person may pose an ''explanandum'' by asking "Why is there smoke?", and another may provide an ''explanans'' by responding "Because there is a fire". In this example, "smoke" is the ''explanandum'', and "fire" is the ''explanans''.

==In scientific method==
[[Carl Gustav Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim]] (1948),&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hempel CG, Oppenheim P |year=1948 |title=Studies in the Logic of Explanation |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=XV |pages=135–175 |doi=10.1086/286983|citeseerx=10.1.1.294.3693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their [[deductive-nomological model]] of scientific explanation, motivated the distinction between explanans and explanandum in order to answer why-questions, rather than simply what-questions:

{{Quotation|"the event under discussion is explained by subsuming it under general laws, i.e., by showing that it occurred in accordance with those laws, by virtue of the realization of certain specified antecedent conditions"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.152)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

Specifically, they define the concepts as follows:

{{Quotation|"By the ''explanandum'', we understand the sentence describing the phenomenon to be explained (not that phenomenon itself); by the ''explanans'', the class of those sentences which are adduced to account for the phenomenon"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.152)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

The crucial comment, with respect to the scientific method, is given as follows:

{{Quotation|"It may be said... that an explanation is not fully adequate unless its explanans, if taken account of in time, could have served as a basis for predicting the phenomenon under consideration....  It is this potential predictive force which gives scientific explanation its importance: Only to the extent that we are able to explain empirical facts can we attain the major objective of scientific research, namely not merely to record the phenomena of our experience, but to learn from them, by basing upon them theoretical generalizations which enable us to anticipate new occurrences and to control, at least to some extent, the changes in our environment"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.154)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

'''Exponential growth''' is exhibited when the [[Rate (mathematics)#Of change|rate of change]]—the change per instant or unit of time—of the value of a mathematical function is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the function's current value, resulting in its value at any time being an [[exponential function]] of time, i.e., a function in which the time value is the exponent.
[[Exponential decay]] occurs in the same way when the growth rate is negative.  In the case of a discrete [[Domain of a function|domain]] of definition with equal intervals, it is also called '''geometric growth''' or '''geometric decay''', the function values forming a [[geometric progression]].  In either exponential growth or exponential decay, the ratio of the rate of change of the quantity to its current size remains constant over time.

The formula for exponential growth of a variable ''x'' at the growth rate ''r'', as time ''t'' goes on in discrete intervals (that is, at integer times 0, 1, 2, 3, ...), is

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = x_0(1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the value of ''x'' at time 0. This formula is transparent when the exponents are converted to multiplication.  For instance, with a starting value of 50 and a growth rate of {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 5% = 0.05}} per interval, the passage of one interval would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05}}; two intervals would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05 × 1.05}}; and three intervals would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.05}}.  In this way, each increase in the exponent by a full interval can be seen to increase the previous total by another five percent.  (The order of multiplication does not change the result based on the [[associative property]] of multiplication.)

Since the time variable, which is the input to this function, occurs as the exponent, this is an [[exponential function]].  This contrasts with growth based on a [[power function]], where the time variable is the base value raised to a fixed exponent, such as cubic growth (or in general terms denoted as [[Growth_rate_(group_theory)|polynomial growth]]).

*'''[[Biology]]'''
** The number of [[microorganism]]s in a [[microbiological culture|culture]] will increase exponentially until an essential nutrient is exhausted. Typically the first organism [[cell division|splits]] into two daughter organisms, who then each split to form four, who split to form eight, and so on. Because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate, it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state. However, cells can grow exponentially at a constant rate while remodeling their metabolism  and gene expression.&lt;ref name="SlavovBudnik2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slavov|first1=Nikolai|last2=Budnik|first2=Bogdan A.|last3=Schwab|first3=David|last4=Airoldi|authorlink4=Edoardo Airoldi|first4=Edoardo M.|last5=van Oudenaarden|first5=Alexander|title=Constant Growth Rate Can Be Supported by Decreasing Energy Flux and Increasing Aerobic Glycolysis|journal=Cell Reports|volume=7|issue=3|year=2014|pages=705–714|issn=2211-1247|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.057|pmid=24767987|pmc=4049626}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
** A virus (for example [[SARS]], or [[smallpox]]) typically will spread exponentially at first, if no artificial [[immunization]] is available. Each infected person can infect multiple new people.
** [[World population|Human population]], if the number of births and deaths per person per year were to remain at current levels (but also see [[logistic growth]]). For example, according to the [[United States Census Bureau]], over the last 100 years (1910 to 2010), the population of the United States of America is exponentially increasing at an average rate of one and a half percent a year (1.5%). This means that the [[doubling time]] of the American population (depending on the yearly growth in population) is approximately 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Census Data, "U.S. Census Bureau", 20 Dec 2012, Internet Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20121220035511/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Physics]]'''
** [[Avalanche breakdown]] within a [[dielectric]] material. A free [[electron]] becomes sufficiently accelerated by an externally applied [[electrical field]] that it frees up additional electrons as it collides with [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s of the dielectric media. These ''secondary'' electrons also are accelerated, creating larger numbers of free electrons. The resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete [[dielectric breakdown]] of the material.
** [[Nuclear chain reaction]] (the concept behind [[nuclear reactors]] and [[nuclear weapons]]). Each [[uranium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] that undergoes [[Nuclear fission|fission]] produces multiple [[neutron]]s, each of which can be [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the [[probability]] of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[shape]] and [[mass]] of the uranium), ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and so the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction. "Due to the exponential rate of increase, at any point in the chain reaction 99% of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations. It is a reasonable approximation to think of the first 53 generations as a latency period leading up to the actual explosion, which only takes 3–4 generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq2.html|title=Introduction to Nuclear Weapon Physics and Design|publisher=Nuclear Weapons Archive|last=Sublette|first=Carey|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Positive feedback]] within the linear range of electrical or electroacoustic [[Amplifier|amplification]] can result in the exponential growth of the amplified signal, although [[resonance]] effects may favor some [[component frequencies]] of the signal over others.
* '''[[Economics]]'''
** [[Economic growth]] is expressed in percentage terms, implying exponential growth.
* '''[[Finance]]'''
** [[Compound interest]] at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital. See also [[rule of 72]].
** [[Pyramid scheme]]s or [[Ponzi scheme]]s also show this type of growth resulting in high profits for a few initial investors and losses among great numbers of investors.
* [[Computer|'''Computer technology''']]
** [[Clock rate|Processing power]] of computers. See also [[Moore's law]] and [[technological singularity]]. (Under exponential growth, there are no singularities. The singularity here is a metaphor, meant to convey an unimaginable future. The link of this hypothetical concept with exponential growth is most vocally made by futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]].)
** In [[computational complexity theory]], computer algorithms of exponential complexity require an exponentially increasing amount of resources (e.g. time, computer memory) for only a constant increase in problem size. So for an algorithm of time complexity 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, if a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 10}} requires 10 seconds to complete, and a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 11}} requires 20 seconds, then a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 12}} will require 40 seconds. This kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes, often between 30 and 100 items (most computer algorithms need to be able to solve much larger problems, up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times, something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm). Also, the effects of [[Moore's Law]] do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely allows you to increase the problem size by a constant. E.g. if a slow processor can solve problems of size ''x'' in time ''t'', then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size ''x'' + constant in the same time ''t''. So exponentially complex algorithms are most often impractical, and the search for more efficient algorithms is one of the central goals of computer science today.

==Basic formula==
A quantity ''x'' depends exponentially on time ''t'' if

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=a\cdot b^{t/\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''a'' is the initial value of ''x'',

:&lt;math&gt;x(0)=a\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

the constant ''b'' is a positive growth factor, and ''τ'' is the [[time constant]]—the time required for ''x'' to increase by one factor of ''b'':

:&lt;math&gt;x(t+\tau)=a \cdot b^{\frac{t+\tau}{\tau}} = a \cdot b^{\frac{t}{\tau}} \cdot b^{\frac{\tau}{\tau}} = x(t)\cdot b\, .&lt;/math&gt;

If {{nowrap|''τ'' &gt; 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' &gt; 1}}, then ''x'' has exponential growth. If {{nowrap|''τ'' &lt; 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' &gt; 1}}, or {{nowrap|''τ'' &gt; 0}}  and 0 &lt; {{nowrap|''b'' &lt; 1}}, then ''x'' has [[exponential decay]].

Example: ''If a species of bacteria doubles every ten minutes, starting out with only one bacterium, how many bacteria would be present after one hour?''  The question implies ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''τ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;min.

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=a\cdot b^{t/\tau}=1\cdot 2^{(60\text{ min})/(10\text{ min})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x(1\text{ hr})= 1 \cdot 2^6 =64.&lt;/math&gt;

After one hour, or six ten-minute intervals, there would be sixty-four bacteria.

Many pairs (''b'',&amp;nbsp;''τ'') of a [[dimensionless]] non-negative number ''b'' and an amount of time ''τ'' (a [[physical quantity]] which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with ''τ'' proportional to log&amp;nbsp;''b''. For any fixed ''b'' not equal to 1 (e.g. ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time ''τ''. For any non-zero time ''τ'' the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive number&amp;nbsp;''b''.

Thus the law of exponential growth can be written in different but mathematically equivalent forms, by using a different [[exponentiation|base]].  The most common forms are the following:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = x_0\cdot e^{kt} = x_0\cdot e^{t/\tau} = x_0 \cdot 2^{t/T}
= x_0\cdot \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)^{t/p},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; expresses the initial quantity ''x''(0).

Parameters (negative in the case of exponential decay):
* The ''growth constant'' ''k'' is the [[frequency]] (number of times per unit time) of growing by a factor ''e''; in finance it is also called the logarithmic return,  [[continuous compounding|continuously compounded return]], or [[Compound interest#Force of interest|force of interest]].
* The ''[[e-folding|e-folding time]]'' ''τ'' is the time it takes to grow by a factor ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]''.
* The ''[[doubling time]]'' ''T'' is the time it takes to double.
* The percent increase ''r'' (a dimensionless number) in a period ''p''.
The quantities ''k'', ''τ'', and ''T'', and for a given ''p'' also ''r'', have a one-to-one connection given by the following equation (which can be derived by taking the natural logarithm of the above):

:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{\ln 2}{T} = \frac{\ln \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' = 0 corresponds to ''r'' = 0 and to ''τ'' and ''T'' being infinite.

If ''p'' is the unit of time the quotient ''t''/''p'' is simply the number of units of time. Using the notation ''t'' for the (dimensionless) number of units of time rather than the time itself, ''t''/''p'' can be replaced by ''t'', but for uniformity this has been avoided here. In this case the division by ''p'' in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a dimensionless number to the correct quantity including unit.

A popular approximated method for calculating the doubling time from the growth rate is the [[rule of 70]],
i.e. &lt;math&gt;T \simeq 70 / r&lt;/math&gt;.

{{wide image|doubling_time_vs_half_life.svg|640px|Graphs comparing doubling times and half lives of exponential growths (bold lines) and decay (faint lines), and their 70/''t'' and 72/''t'' approximations. In the [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Doubling_time_vs_half_life.svg SVG version], hover over a graph to highlight it and its complement.}}

==Reformulation as log-linear growth==
If a variable ''x'' exhibits exponential growth according to &lt;math&gt;x(t)=x_0(1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;, then the log (to any base) of ''x'' [[linear function|grows linearly]] over time, as can be seen by taking [[logarithm]]s of both sides of the exponential growth equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\log x(t) = \log x_0 + t \cdot \log (1+r).&lt;/math&gt;

This allows an exponentially growing variable to be modeled with a [[Nonlinear regression#Linearization|log-linear model]]. For example, if one wishes to empirically estimate the growth rate from intertemporal data on ''x'', one can [[linear regression|linearly regress]] log ''x'' on ''t''.

==Differential equation==
The [[exponential function]] &lt;math&gt;x(t)=x(0) e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[linear differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \!\, \frac{dx}{dt} = kx&lt;/math&gt;

saying that the change per instant of time of ''x'' at time ''t'' is proportional to the value of ''x''(''t''), and ''x''(''t'') has the [[initial value]]
:&lt;math&gt;x(0).&lt;/math&gt;

The differential equation is solved by direct integration:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = kx \\[5pt]
\frac{dx} x &amp; = k\, dt \\[5pt]
\int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} \frac{dx}{x} &amp; = k \int_0^t  \, dt \\[5pt]
\ln \frac{x(t)}{x(0)} &amp; =  kt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

: &lt;math&gt; x(t) =  x(0) e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above differential equation, if {{nowrap|''k'' &lt; 0}}, then the quantity experiences [[exponential decay]].

For a [[nonlinear]] variation of this growth model see [[logistic function]].

==Difference equation==
The [[difference equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = a \cdot x_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;

has solution

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = x_0 \cdot a^t,&lt;/math&gt;

showing that ''x'' experiences exponential growth.

== Other growth rates ==
In the long run, exponential growth of any kind will overtake linear growth of any kind (the basis of the [[Malthusian catastrophe]]) as well as any [[polynomial]] growth, i.e., for all α:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} {t^\alpha \over ae^t} =0.&lt;/math&gt;

There is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear (in the long run). See [[Degree of a polynomial#The degree computed from the function values]].

Growth rates may also be faster than exponential. In the most extreme case, when growth increases without bound in finite time, it is called [[hyperbolic growth]]. In between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior, like the [[hyperoperation]]s beginning at [[tetration]], and &lt;math&gt;A(n,n)&lt;/math&gt;, the diagonal of the [[Ackermann function]].

==Limitations of models==
Exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions, as unbounded growth is not physically realistic. Although growth may initially be exponential, the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored [[negative feedback]] factors become significant (leading to a [[logistic growth]] model) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model, such as continuity or instantaneous feedback, break down.

==Exponential stories==

===Rice on a chessboard===
{{see also|Wheat and chessboard problem}}
According to an old legend, vizier Sissa Ben Dahir presented an Indian King Sharim with a beautiful, hand-made [[chessboard]]. The king asked what he would like in return for his gift and the courtier surprised the king by asking for one grain of rice on the first square, two grains on the second, four grains on the third etc. The king readily agreed and asked for the rice to be brought. All went well at first, but the requirement for 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; grains on the ''n''th square demanded over a million grains on the 21st square, more than a million million ({{aka}} [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]]) on the 41st and there simply was not enough rice in the whole world for the final squares. (From Swirski, 2006)&lt;ref name=Porritt-2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Porritt|first=Jonathan|title=Capitalism: as if the world matters|year=2005|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|isbn=1-84407-192-8|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[second half of the chessboard]] is the time when an exponentially growing influence is having a significant economic impact on an organization's overall business strategy.

===Water lily===
French children are told a story in which they imagine having a pond with [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]] leaves floating on the surface. The lily population doubles in size every day and, if left unchecked, it will smother the pond in thirty days killing all the other living things in the water. Day after day, the plant's growth is small and so it is decided that it shall be cut down when the water lilies cover half of the pond. The children are then asked on what day will half of the pond be covered in water lilies.  The solution is simple when one considers that the water lilies must double to completely cover the pond on the thirtieth day.  Therefore, the water lilies will cover half of the pond on the twenty-ninth day. There is only one day to save the pond. (From Meadows ''et al''. 1972)&lt;ref name=Porritt-2005/&gt;

[[File:Freedom of Thought Ben Franklin.jpg|thumb|200px|"Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom &amp; no such thing as publick liberty without freedom of speech", [[Benjamin Franklin]], 1722.]]

'''Freedom of thought''' (also called  '''freedom of conscience''' or '''ideas''') is the [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] of an individual to hold or consider a fact, viewpoint, or [[thought]], independent of others' viewpoints. 

== Overview ==
&lt;!-- Note: perhaps something could be mentioned here about the Four Freedoms proposed by Franklin Roosevelt, which also includes freedom from fear and freedom from want --&gt;

Freedom of thought is the precursor and progenitor of—and thus is closely linked to—other liberties, including [[freedom of religion]], freedom of speech, and freedom of expression. Though freedom of thought is axiomatic for many other freedoms they are in no way required for it to operate and exist. The conception of a freedom or a right does not guarantee its inclusion, legality, or protection via a philosophical caveat. It is a very important concept in the Western world and nearly all{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} democratic constitutions protect these freedoms. For instance, the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] contains the famous guarantee in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] that laws may not be made that interfere with religion "or prohibiting the free exercise thereof". U.S. [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Benjamin Cardozo]] reasoned in ''[[Palko v. Connecticut]]'' (1937):

{{quote|Freedom of thought... is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom. With rare aberrations a pervasive recognition of this truth can be traced in our history, political and legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
 |litigants=Palko v. State of Connecticut

 |reporter=U.S.
 |opinion=319

 |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=302&amp;invol=319
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Such ideas are also a vital part of [[international human rights law]]. In the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which is legally binding on member states of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), "freedom of thought" is listed under Article 18:

{{quote|Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.}}

The [[United Nations]]' [[Human Rights Committee]] states that this, "distinguishes the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief from the freedom to manifest religion or belief. It does not permit any limitations whatsoever on the freedom of thought and conscience or on the freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief of one's choice. These freedoms are protected unconditionally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=General Comment No. 22: The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Art. 18) : . 30/07/93. CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.4, General Comment No. 22. (General Comments)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Article 19 of the UDHR guarantees that "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference".

==History of development and suppression==
{{wikinews|Interview with dismissed Ocean Drive columnist Trisha Posner}}

It is impossible to know with certainty what another person is thinking, making suppression difficult. The concept is developed throughout the Bible, most fully in the writings of [[Paul of Tarsus]] (e.g., "For why should my freedom [''eleutheria''] be judged by another's conscience [''suneideseos'']?" [[1 Corinthians]] 10:29).&lt;ref&gt;Eugene J. Cooper, "Man's Basic Freedom and Freedom of Conscience in the Bible : Reflections on 1 Corinthians 8–10", ''Irish Theological Quarterly'' Dec 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GiordanoBrunoCampodeiFiori cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bronze statue of [[Giordano Bruno]], Campo de' Fiori, Rome]]
Although Greek philosophers [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]] had discussed Freedom of Thought minimally, the edicts of King [[Ashoka]] (3rd century BC) have been called the first decree respecting Freedom of Conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6cL9Jng5okC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=%22freedom+of+conscience%22+ashoka&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22freedom%20of%20conscience%22%20ashoka&amp;f=true|title=Luigi Luzzatti, "The First Decree on Freedom of Conscience" p. 47 in ''God in Freedom''|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In European tradition, aside from the decree of religious toleration by [[Constantine I]] at Milan in 313, the philosophers [[Themistius]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[John Locke]], [[Voltaire]], [[Alexandre Vinet]], and [[John Stuart Mill]] have been considered major proponents of the idea of Freedom of Conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Luzzatti, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Elizabeth I]] revoked a thought censorship law in the late sixteenth century, because, according to Sir [[Francis Bacon]], she did "not [like] to make windows into men's souls and secret thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brimacombe |first=Peter |title=All the Queen's Men: The World of Elizabeth I |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2000 |pages=125 |isbn=0-312-23251-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her reign, philosopher, mathematician, [[astrologer]], and astronomer [[Giordano Bruno]] took refuge in England from the [[Italian Inquisition]], where he published a number of his books regarding an infinite universe and topics banned by the Catholic Church. After leaving the safety of England, Bruno was eventually [[Execution by burning|burned]] as a [[Christian heresy|heretic]] in Rome for refusing to recant his ideas. For this reason, he is considered by some to be a martyr for free thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Giordano Bruno: Martyrs of free thought no. 1|author=Arturo Labriola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[freedom of expression]] can be limited through [[censorship]], arrests, [[book burning]], or [[propaganda]], and this tends to discourage freedom of thought. Examples of effective campaigns against freedom of expression are the Soviet suppression of genetics research in favor of a theory known as [[Lysenkoism]], the book-burning campaigns of [[Nazi Germany]], the radical [[anti-intellectualism]] enforced in [[Cambodia]] under [[Pol Pot]], the strict limits on freedom of expression imposed by the [[communist state|Communist]] governments of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and Cuba or by [[right-wing authoritarian]] dictatorships such as those of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]] and [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Spain]].

The [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], which states that [[thought]] is inherently embedded in [[language]], would support the claim that an effort to limit the use of words of language is actually a form of restricting freedom of thought.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This was explored in [[George Orwell]]'s novel'' [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'', with the idea of [[Newspeak]], a stripped-down form of the [[English language]] lacking the capacity for metaphor and limiting expression of original ideas.

While greenwashing is not new, its use has increased over recent years to meet consumer demand for [[environmentally friendly]] goods and services. The problem is compounded by lax enforcement by regulatory agencies such as the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in the United States, the [[Competition Bureau]] in Canada, and the [[Committee of Advertising Practice]] and the [[Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice]] in the United Kingdom. Critics of the practice suggest that the rise of greenwashing, paired with ineffective regulation, contributes to consumer skepticism of all green claims, and diminishes the power of the consumer in driving companies toward greener solutions for manufacturing processes and business operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dahl |first=Richard |title=Greenwashing: Do You Know What You're Buying? |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |date=1 June 2010 |volume=118 |issue=6 |pages=a246–a252 |doi=10.1289/ehp.118-a246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many corporate structures use greenwashing as a way to repair public perception of their brand.

==Usage==
The term ''greenwashing'' was coined by [[New York City|New York]] [[environmentalist]] [[Jay Westervelt]] in a 1986 essay regarding the [[hospitality industry|hotel industry]]'s practice of placing placards in each room promoting reuse of towels ostensibly to "save the environment." Westervelt noted that, in most cases, little or no effort toward reducing energy waste was being made by these institutions—as evidenced by the lack of cost reduction this practice effected. Westervelt opined that the actual objective of this "green campaign" on the part of many hoteliers was, in fact, increased profit. Westervelt thus labeled this and other outwardly environmentally conscientious acts with a greater, underlying purpose of profit increase as ''greenwashing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/02/12/the-history-of-greenwashing-how-dirty-towels-impacted-the-green/ |title=A History of Greenwashing: How Dirty Towels Impacted the Green Movement |first=Jim |last=Motavalli |date=2011-02-12 |work=AOL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |trans-title=Greenwashers invade the market |language=Danish |title=Grønvaskere invaderer børsen |url=http://epn.dk/privatokonomi/investering/article1374993.ece |work=EPN.dk |publisher=Jyllands-Posten |date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2012-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705195538/http://epn.dk/privatokonomi/investering/article1374993.ece |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/special-report/09/16/08/beware-green-marketing-warns-greenpeace-exec |title=Beware of green marketing, warns Greenpeace exec |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205171221/http://www.lodgingmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=FD212DB2AA944808BF5CE6519B2BCC06 |archivedate=2009-02-05 |date=2009-02-01 |url=http://www.lodgingmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=FD212DB2AA944808BF5CE6519B2BCC06 |title=The Real Deal?

In addition, the political term "linguistic detoxification" describes when, through [[legislation]] or other [[government]] action, the definitions of [[toxicity]] for certain substances are changed, or the name of the substance is changed, so that fewer things fall under a particular classification as toxic. The origin of this phrase has been attributed to environmental activist and author [[Barry Commoner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Commoner |first=Barry |title=After 20 Years: The Crisis of Environmental Regulation |journal=New Solutions |year=1990 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=22–29 |doi=10.2190/ns1.1.g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, introduction of a [[Carbon emission trading|Carbon Emission Trading Scheme]] may feel good, but may be counterproductive if the cost of carbon is priced too low, or if large emitters are given "free credits." For example, [[Bank of America]] subsidiary [[MBNA]] offers an Eco-Logique [[MasterCard]] for Canadian consumers that rewards customers with [[carbon offsets]] as they continue using the card. Customers may feel that they are nullifying their [[carbon footprint]] by purchasing polluting goods with the card. However, only 0.5 percent of purchase price goes into purchasing carbon offsets, while the rest of the [[interchange fee]] still goes to the bank.&lt;ref name=CashingIn&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.climatechangecentral.com/publications/enerclick/january-2008/cashing-environmental-cow |title=Cashing in on the Environmental |publisher=Climate Change Central |date=2009-11-13 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130115222626/http://www.climatechangecentral.com/publications/enerclick/january-2008/cashing-environmental-cow |archivedate=2013-01-15 |accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such campaigns and [[marketing communications]], designed to publicize and highlight organizational CSR policies to various stakeholders, affect corporate reputation and brand image, but the proliferation of unsubstantiated ethical claims and greenwashing by some companies has resulted in increasing consumer cynicism and mistrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahdi |first1=Khosro S. |last2=Acikdilli |first2=Gaye |title=Marketing Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Marriage of Convenience or Shotgun Wedding? |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=August 2009 |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=103–113 |doi=10.1007/s10551-009-0113-1 |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-009-0113-1?LI=true |issn=0167-4544 |language=en |accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the mid 1960s, the environmental movement gained momentum. This popularity prompted many companies to create a new green image through advertising. [[Jerry Mander]], a former [[Madison Avenue]] advertising executive, called this new form of advertising "ecopornography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Brian|title=Great Debates in American Environmental History|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport|isbn=0-313-33930-9|editor-last=Lybecker |editor-first=Donna L. |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Earth Day]] was held on April 22, 1970. This encouraged many industries to advertise themselves as being friendly to the environment. Public utilities spent 300 million dollars advertising themselves as clean green companies. This was eight times more than the money they spent on pollution reduction research.&lt;ref name="tglo"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= http://thegreenlifeonline.org/greenwash101/ |title=Greenwashing 101 - The Green Life |website=Thegreenlifeonline.org |date=2012-07-06 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gfs&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=242 |title=CorpWatch : Greenwash Fact Sheet |website=Corpwatch.org |date=2001-03-22 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the [[Chevron Corporation]] launched one of the most famous greenwashing ad campaigns in history. Chevron's "People Do" advertisements were aimed at a "hostile audience" of "societally conscious" people. Two years after the launch of the campaign, surveys found people in California trusted Chevron more than other oil companies to protect the environment. In the late 1980s The [[American Chemistry Council]] started a program called [[Responsible Care]], which shone light on the environmental performances and precautions of the group's members. The loose guidelines of responsible care caused industries to adopt self-regulation over government regulation.&lt;ref name=tglo/&gt;&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;

In 1991, a study published in the Journal of Public Policy and Marketing ([[American Marketing Association]]) found that 58% of environmental ads had at least one deceptive claim. Another study found that 77% of people said the environmental reputation of company affected whether they would buy their products. One fourth of all household products marketed around Earth Day advertised themselves as being green and environmentally friendly. In 1998 the [[Federal Trade Commission]] created the "Green Guidelines," which defined terms used in environmental marketing. The following year the FTC found that the Nuclear Energy Institute claims of being environmentally clean were not true. The FTC did nothing about the ads because they were out of their jurisdiction. This caused the FTC to realize they needed new clear enforceable standards. In 1999, according to environmental activist organizations, the word "greenwashing" was added to the ''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;ref name=tglo/&gt;&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;

In 2002, during the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in Johannesburg, the Greenwashing Academy hosted the Greenwash Academy Awards. The ceremony awarded companies like [[BP]], [[ExxonMobil]], and even the [[Federal government of the United States|US Government]] for their elaborate greenwashing ads and support for greenwashing.&lt;ref name=tglo/&gt;&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;

More recently, social scientists have been investigating claims of and the impact of greenwashing. In 2005, Ramus and Monteil conducted secondary data analysis of two databases to uncover corporate commitment to implementation of environmental policies as opposed to greenwashing. They found while companies in the [[petroleum industry|oil]] and gas are more likely to implement environmental policies than [[service industry]] companies, they are less likely to commit to [[fossil fuel]] reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramus |first=Catherine A. |last2=Montiel |first2=Ivan |title=When Are Corporate Environmental Policies a Form of Greenwashing? |journal=Business &amp; Society |date=July 26, 2016 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=377–414 |doi=10.1177/0007650305278120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a study was done showing that 4.5% of products tested were found to be truly green as opposed to 2% in 2009. In 2009 2,739 products claimed to be green while in 2010 the number rose to 4,744. The same study in 2010 found that 95% percent of the consumer products claiming to be green were not green at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sinsofgreenwashing.com |author=Terra Choice Group |title=The Sins of Greenwashing Home and Family |accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==

===Australia===
The Australian [[Trade Practices Act]] has been modified to include punishment of companies that provide misleading environmental claims. Any organization found guilty of such could face up $6 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/12/16/nurofen-fine-misleading-claims-australia-increased-35-million/ |title=Nurofen fine over misleading claims in Australia increased to £3.5 million |agency=France Presse Agence |date=16 December 2016 |newspaper=Telegraph |accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fines. In addition, the guilty party must pay for all expenses incurred while setting the record straight about their product or company's actual [[environmental impact]].&lt;ref name=Naish&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naish |first=J. |year=2008 |title=Lies...Damned lies...And green lies |journal=Ecologist |volume=38 |issue= 5 |pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Canada's [[Competition Bureau]] along with the [[Canadian Standards Association]] are discouraging companies from making "vague claims" towards their products' environmental impact. Any claims must be backed up by "readily available data."&lt;ref name=Naish/&gt;

===Norway===
[[Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman|Norway's consumer ombudsman]] has targeted automakers who claim that their cars are "green," "clean" or "environmentally friendly" with some of the world's strictest advertising guidelines. Consumer Ombudsman official Bente Øverli said: "Cars cannot do anything good for the environment except less damage than others." Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop the words. Øverli said she did not know of other countries going so far in cracking down on cars and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbrukerombudet.no/asset/2857/1/2857_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101123183503/http://forbrukerombudet.no/asset/2857/1/2857_1.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.motoring.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=4028677 |title=Prove 'clean, green' ads, Norway tells automakers |publisher=Motoring.co.za |date=|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/09/norway_says_car.php |title=Greenwash Watch: Norways Says Cars Neither Green Nor Clean |publisher=Treehugger.com |date=|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL0671323420070906 |title=Norways Says Cars Neither Green Nor Clean |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2009-09-11 | first=Alister |last=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S.===
The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) provides voluntary guidelines for environmental marketing claims. These guidelines give the FTC the right to prosecute false and misleading advertisement claims. The green guidelines were not created to be used as an enforceable guideline but instead were intended to be followed voluntarily. Listed below are the green guidelines set by the FTC.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Qualifications and disclosures: The Commission traditionally has held that in order to be effective, any qualifications or disclosures such as those described in these guides should be sufficiently clear, prominent and understandable to prevent deception. Clarity of language, relative type size and proximity to the claim being qualified, and an absence of contrary claims that could undercut effectiveness, will maximize the likelihood that the qualifications and disclosures are appropriately clear and prominent.&lt;ref name=gft&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117145015/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427.htm |archivedate=November 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Distinction between benefits of product, package and service: An environmental marketing claim should be presented in a way that makes clear whether the environmental attribute or benefit being asserted refers to the product, the product's [[packaging]], a service or to a portion or component of the product, package or service. In general, if the environmental attribute or benefit applies to all but minor, incidental components of a product or package, the claim need not be qualified to identify that fact. There may be exceptions to this general principle. For example, if an unqualified "[[recyclable]]" claim is made and the presence of the incidental component significantly limits the ability to recycle the product, then the claim would be deceptive.&lt;ref name=gft/&gt;
*Overstatement of environmental attribute: An environmental marketing claim should not be presented in a manner that overstates the environmental attribute or benefit, expressly or by implication. Marketers should avoid implications of significant environmental benefits if the benefit is in fact negligible.&lt;ref name=gft/&gt;
*Comparative claims: Environmental marketing claims that include a comparative statement should be presented in a manner that makes the basis for the comparison sufficiently clear to avoid consumer deception. In addition, the advertiser should be able to substantiate the comparison.&lt;ref name=gft/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The FTC has said in 2010 that it will update its guidelines for environmental marketing claims in an attempt to reduce greenwashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencleancertified.com/green-cleaning-health/green-watch/FTC-Reviews-Guidelines-for-Green-Claims/ |title=FTC Reviews Guidelines for Green Claims |website=Greencleancertified.com |date=2016-06-15 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revision to the FTC's Green Guides covers a wide range of public input, including hundreds of consumer and industry comments on previously proposed revisions. The updates and revision to the existing Guides include a new section of carbon offsets, "green" certifications and seals renewable energy and renewable materials claims. According to FTC Chairman [[Jon Leibowitz]], "The introduction of environmentally friendly products into the marketplace is a win for consumers who want to purchase greener products and producers who wants to sell them." Leibowitz also says the win-win can only claim if marketers' claims are straightforward and proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/10/greenguides.shtm |title=FTC Issues Revised "Green Guides"  |website=US Federal Trade Commission |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the FTC began enforcing the revisions put forth in the Green Guides. The FTC cracked down on six different companies, in which five of the cases were concerned with the false or misleading advertising surrounding the biodegradability of plastics. The FTC charged ECM Biofilms, American Plastic Manufacturing, CHAMP, Clear Choice Housewares, and Carnie Cap, for misrepresenting the biodegradability of their plastics treated with additives.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/communications/jennifer-elks/ftc-cracking-down-misleading-unsubstantiated-biodegradab|title=FTC Cracking Down on Misleading, Unsubstantiated Biodegradability Claims|website=Sustainable Brands|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTC charged a sixth company, AJM Packaging Corporation, for violating a commission consent order put in place that prohibits companies from using advertising claims based on the product or packaging being "degradable, biodegradable, or photodegradable" without reliable scientific information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The FTC now requires companies to disclose and provide the information that qualifies their environmental claims to ensure transparency.

*"Clean Coal," an initiative adopted by several platforms for the 2008 U.S presidential elections is an example of political greenwashing. The policy cited carbon capture as a means of reducing carbon emissions by capturing and injecting carbon dioxide produced by coal power plants into layers of porous rock below the ground. According to [[Fred Pearce]]'s Greenwash column in ''[[The Guardian]]'', "[[Coal pollution mitigation|clean coal]]" is the "ultimate [[climate change]] [[oxymoron]]"—"pure and utter greenwash" he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pearce |first=Fred |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/26/greenwash-clean-coal

*The conversion of the term "Tar Sands" to "Oil Sands," (Alberta, Canada) in corporate and political language reflects an ongoing debate between the project's adherents and opponents. This semantic shift can be seen as a case of greenwashing in an attempt at countering growing public concern as to the environmental and health impacts of the industry. While advocates claim that the shift is scientifically derived to better reflect the usage of the sands as a precursor to oil, environmental groups are claiming that this is simply a means of cloaking the issue behind friendlier terminology.
*Over the past years [[Walmart]] has proclaimed to "go green" with a sustainability campaign. However, according to the Institute For Local Reliance (ILRS), “Walmart’s sustainability campaign has done more to improve the company’s image than the environment.” Walmart still only generates 2 percent of U.S. electricity from wind and solar resources. According to the ILRS, Walmart routinely donates money to political candidates who vote against the environment. The retail giant responded to these accusations by stating "that it is serious about its commitment to reduce 20 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2015".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ilsr.org/top-10-ways-walmart-fails-sustainability/ |title=Top 10 Ways Walmart Fails on Sustainability &amp;#124; Institute for Local Self-Reliance |website=Ilsr.org |date=2012-04-17 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Environmental accounting]] can easily be used to pretend that environmental impacts of a company are reduced while actual impacts increase. This has been shown, for example, in a case of corporate carbon accounting: the company celebrated reduced relative emissions while absolute emissions increased. The same company achieved reducing current emissions by "correcting" past emissions as higher (effecting a calculation that presents current emissions as relatively lower).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bvb:384-opus4-21997 |title=OPUS 4 &amp;#124; Enacting Environments: An Ethnography of the Digitalisation and Naturalisation of Emissions |website=Nbn-resolving.de |date= |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
Organizations and individuals are making attempts to reduce the impact of greenwashing by exposing it to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=106166&amp;catId=100583&amp;tid=100008 |title=Green Watch |publisher=choice.com.au |date=|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greenwashing Index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwashingindex.com/ |title=Greenwashing Index |publisher=Greenwashing Index |date=|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by the [[University of Oregon]] in partnership with EnviroMedia Social Marketing, allows examples of greenwashing to be uploaded and rated by the public.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopgreenwash.org/ |title=Greenpeace &amp;#124; Greenwashing |website=Stopgreenwash.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Code of Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing has a specific section (section 49) targeting environmental claims.

According to some organizations opposing greenwashing, there has been a significant increase in its use by companies over the last decade{{When|date=July 2017}}. TerraChoice Environmental Marketing, an advertising consultancy company, issued a report denoting a 79% increase in the usage of corporate greenwashing between 2007 and 2009. Additionally, it has begun to manifest itself in new varied ways. Within the non-residential building products market in the United States, some companies are beginning to claim that their environmentally minded policy changes will allow them to earn points through the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating program. This point system has been held up as an example of the "gateway effect" that the drive to market products as environmentally friendly is having on company policies. Some have claimed that the greenwashing trend may be enough to eventually effect a genuine reduction in environmentally damaging practices. 

According to the Home and Family Edition, 95% consumer products claiming to be green were discovered to commit at least one of the "Sins of Greenwashing". The Seven Sins of Greenwashing are as follows:
# Sin of the Hidden Trade-off, committed by suggesting a product is "green" based on an unreasonably narrow set of attributes without attention to other important environmental issues.
# Sin of No Proof, committed by an environmental claim that cannot be substantiated by easily accessible supporting information or by a reliable third-party certification. 
# Sin of [[Vagueness]], committed by every claim that is so poorly defined or broad that its real meaning is likely to be misunderstood by the consumer.
# Sin of Worshiping False Labels is committed when a claim, communicated either through words or images, gives the impression of a third-party [[testimonial|endorsement]] where no such endorsement exists. 
# Sin of [[Irrelevance]], committed by making an environmental claim that may be truthful but which is unimportant or unhelpful for consumers seeking environmentally preferable products.
# Sin of Lesser of Two Evils, committed by claims that may be true within the product category, but that risk distracting consumers from the greater environmental impact of the category as a whole.
# Sin of [[Fibbing]], the least frequent Sin, is committed by making environmental claims that are simply false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinsofgreenwashing.org/ |title=Home and Family Edition |publisher=The Sins of Greenwashing |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ed Gillespie identified "ten signs of greenwashing", which are similar to the ''Seven Sins'' listed above, but with three additional indicators.
# Suggestive pictures - Images that imply a baseless green impact, such as flowers issuing from the exhaust pipe of a vehicle.
# Just not credible - A claim that touts the [[environmentally friendly]] attributes of a dangerous product, such as cigarettes.
# Gobbledygook - The use of [[jargon]] or information that the average person can not readily understand or be able to verify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillespie |first=Ed |title=Stemming the tide of 'greenwash' |journal=Consumer Policy Review |date=May 2008 |volume=18 |issue=3 |page=79 |url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/32818374/stemming-tide-greenwash |via=ebscohost |accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies may pursue [[environmental certification]] to avoid greenwashing through independent verification of their green claims. For example, the [[Carbon Trust]] Standard launched in 2007 with the stated aim "to end 'greenwash' and highlight firms that are genuine about their commitment to the environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/24/carbonemissions.carbonfootprints |title=Carbon Trust aims to end 'greenwash' by launching company standard |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 June 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Modernization theory}}
This article delineates the '''history of modernisation theory'''. Modernisation refers to a model of a progressive transition from a 'pre-modern' or '[[Traditional society|traditional]]' to a 'modern' [[society]]. The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that, with assistance, "traditional" countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have. Modernisation theory attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to [[social progress]] and development of societies, and seeks to explain the process of [[social evolution]]. Modernisation theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, [[World-systems theory|world-systems]] theorists, [[globalisation]] theorists and [[dependency theory|dependency]] theorists among others. Modernisation theory not only stresses the process of change, but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Earliest expressions of the theory ==
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Émile Durkheim]]

The basic principles of Modernisation theory can be derived from the [[Idea of Progress]], which emerged in the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment]] with the idea that people themselves could develop and change their society. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The French philosopher [[Marquis de Condorcet]] was involved in the origins of the theory with the idea that technological advancements and economic changes can enable changes in moral and cultural values. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Condorcet was the first to make the connection between economic and social development and to suggest that there can be continuous progress and improvement in human affairs.&lt;ref name="Gilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilman|first1=Nils|title=Modernization theory : its origins and rise in Cold War America|date=2003|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7399-7|edition=Johns Hopkins pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of this view implies that new processes and improvements are continually needed to keep pace with a constantly changing world. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Furthermore, Condorcet advocated technological advancement as a means of giving people further control over their environments, arguing that technological progress would eventually spur social progress. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In addition to [[social structure]] and the evolution of societies, the French [[sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] developed the concept of [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], which stresses the interdependence of the institutions of a society and their interaction in maintaining cultural and social unity. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} His most famous work is ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', which described mechanisms for the maintenance of [[social order]] and the ways in which primitive societies might make the transition to becoming more economically advanced industrial societies. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Durkheim suggested that in a capitalist society, with a complex division of labour, economic regulation would be needed to maintain order. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} He stressed that the major transition from a primitive social order to a more advanced industrial society could otherwise bring crisis and disorder. Durkheim furthermore developed the idea of [[social evolution]], which was coined by [[Herbert Spencer]], which indicates how societies and cultures develop over time; for Durkheim, social evolution is like biological evolution with reference to the development of its components. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As with living organisms and species, societies progress through several stages, generally beginning at a simple level and developing toward a more complex level of organisation. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Societies adapt to surrounding environments, but also interact with other societies, which further contributes to progress and development. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
Modern sociology evolved in part as a reaction to the problems associated with [[modernity]], such as [[industrialisation]] and the process of [[rationalization (sociology)|'rationalisation']]. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Modernisation theory emerged further in the late 19th century and was especially popular among scholars in the mid-20th century. One notable advocate was Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] whose ''Mandarins of the Future'' (2003) stressed the importance of societies remaining open to change and saw reactionary forces as restricting development. Maintaining tradition for tradition's sake was thought to be harmful to progress and development.&lt;ref name="khan 162-164"&gt;Khan, p. 162–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of modernisation tend to fall into two camps, optimists and pessimists. The former view holds that what some see as a setback for the theory (events such as the [[Iranian Revolution]] or the persistence of instability in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) are invariably temporary setbacks &lt;ref&gt;Brugger and Hannan, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; on the road to progress. Pessimists argue that certain 'non-modern' areas of the world are incapable of becoming modern.&lt;ref name="Macionis 953"&gt;Macionis, p. 953.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eminent sociologist [[Max Weber]] also made important contributions to development theory. Weber's concept of "rationalisation" was mobilised by those who held that the most important factor behind modernisation was the growth of rationality as a core value. Normally rationality denotes the universally available logic underpinning thought and deliberation in a particular society. Most theorists consider it indispensable for the modernisation process. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Rationality allows people to think in new and innovative ways; innovation is thus coeval with modernisation.

== Contributors ==

Among the academics who contributed much to this theory are [[Walt Whitman Rostow|W. W. Rostow]], who in his ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto'' (1960) concentrates on the [[economic system]] side of the modernisation, trying to show factors needed for a country to reach the path to modernisation in his [[Rostovian take-off model]]. [[David Apter]] concentrated on the [[political system]] and [[history of democracy]], researching the connection between [[democracy]], good [[governance]] and efficiency and modernisation. [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] in "Some Social Requisites of Democracy" (1959) argued that economic development sets off a series of profound social changes that together tend to produce democracy. [[David McClelland]] (''The Achieving Society'', 1967) approached this subject from the [[psychology|psychological]] perspective, with his [[motivation]]s theory, arguing that modernisation cannot happen until a given society values innovation, striving for improvement and entrepreneurship. Alex Inkeles (''Becoming Modern'', 1974) similarly creates a model of ''modern personality'', which needs to be independent, active, interested in public policies and cultural matters, open for new experiences, rational and being able to create long-term plans for the future. [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978) interprets modernisation from the point of view of societies that are quickly and radically transformed. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===United States===
[[File:American Progress (John Gast painting).jpg|thumb|300px|This painting (circa 1872) by [[John Gast (painter)|John Gast]] called ''American Progress'', is an allegorical representation of the modernisation of the new west. Here [[Historical Columbia|Columbia]], a personification of the United States, leads civilisation westward with American settlers, stringing telegraph wire as she sweeps west; she holds a school book. The different stages of economic activity of the pioneers are highlighted and, especially, the changing forms of transportation. The Native Americans and wild animals flee.]]
The [[Progressive Era|Progressives in the United States in the early 20th century]] were avid modernisers. They believed in [[science]], technology, expertise—and especially education—as the grand solution to society's weaknesses. Characteristics of progressivism included a favorable attitude toward urban-industrial society, belief in mankind's ability to improve the environment and conditions of life, belief in obligation to intervene in economic and social affairs, and a belief in the ability of experts and in efficiency of government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Buenker, and KABASO.S.MUYA. ''Progressivism'' (1986); Maureen Flanagan, ''America Reformed: Progressives and Progressivisms, 1890s-1920s'' (2007); Modernisation theory exerts a "powerful influence" on historians dealing with the 1896-1916 era, asserts Martin J. Sklar, ''The United States as a developing country'' (1992) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Monroe, a professor of history at Columbia University, was a member of [[The Inquiry]]—a team of American experts at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He drew on his experience in the Philippines to assess the educational needs of developing areas such as Albania, Turkey and central Africa. Presenting educational development as instrumental to nation-building and socioeconomic development, Monroe recommended the implementation of a progressive curriculum - with an emphasis on practical, adult, and teacher training - in a national system of education, as a basis for self-development, except in Africa. His approach shaped American cooperation with developing countries in the 1920s and modernisation efforts during the 1920s-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Ment, "Education, nation‐building and modernisation after World War I: American ideas for the Peace Conference," ''Paedagogica Historica,'' Feb 2005, Vol. 41 Issue 1/2, pp 159-177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany's "Sonderweg"===
{{main article|Sonderweg}}
[[Jürgen Kocka|Kocka]] (1988) and Sheri Berman are historians who emphasise the central importance of a German ''[[Sonderweg]]'' ("special path") or "exceptionalism" as the root of [[Nazism]] and the German catastrophe in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sheri Berman, "Modernisation in Historical Perspective: The Case of Imperial Germany," ''World Politics,'' Volume 53, Number 3, April 2001, pp. 431-462 {{doi|10.1353/wp.2001.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fritz Fischer]] and his students emphasised [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Germany’s primary guilt for causing World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Kocka, "German History before Hitler: The Debate about the German 'Sonderweg.'" ''Journal of Contemporary History,''  Jan 1988, Vol. 23#1, pp 3-16 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/260865 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], a leader of the [[Bielefeld School]] of social history, places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s-1870s, when economic modernisation took place, but political modernisation did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service.  Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernising society. Recognising the importance of modernising forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus).  The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernisation of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's interpretation is his treatment of "the middle class" and "revolution," each of which was instrumental in shaping the 20th century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of "charismatic domination," which focuses heavily on [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;Wehler, ''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gründung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914-1949'' (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society. None of the series has yet been translated into English. A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, ''The German Empire, 1871-1918'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

The historiographical concept of a German Sonderweg has had a turbulent history. Scholars of the 19th century who emphasised a separate German path to modernity saw it as a positive factor that differentiated Germany from the "western path" typified by Great Britain. The stressed the strong bureaucratic state, reforms initiated by Bismarck and other strong leaders, the Prussian service ethos, the high culture of philosophy and music, and Germany's pioneering of a [[Welfare state|social welfare state]].  In the 1950s, historians in  West Germany argued that the Sonderweg led Germany to the disaster of 1933-1945. The special circumstances of German historical structures and experiences, were interpreted as preconditions that, while not directly causing National Socialism, did hamper the development of a liberal democracy and facilitate the rise of fascism. The Sonderweg paradigm has provided the impetus for at least three strands of research in [[German historiography]]: the [[long 19th century]], the history of the bourgeoisie, and comparisons with the West.  After 1990, increased attention to cultural dimensions and to comparative and relational history moved German historiography to different topics, with much less attention paid to the Sonderweg.  While some historians have abandoned the Sonderweg thesis, they have not provided a generally accepted alternative interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Walser Smith,  "When the Sonderweg Debate Left Us ," ''German Studies Review,''on May 2008, Vol. 31#2  pp 225-240&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century France===
In his seminal book ''Peasants Into Frenchmen: The Modernisation of Rural [[France]], 1880–1914'' (1976), historian [[Eugen Weber]] traced the modernisation of French villages and argued that rural France went from backward and isolated to modern and possessing a sense of French nationhood during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Amato, "Eugen Weber's France" ''Journal of Social History,'' Volume 25, 1992 pp 879–882.&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasised the roles of railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription. He based his findings on school records, migration patterns, military service documents and economic trends. Weber argued that until 1900 or so a sense of French nationhood was weak in the provinces. Weber then looked at how the policies of the Third Republic created a sense of French nationality in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, "The Second Republic, Politics, and the Peasant," ''French Historical Studies'' Vol. 11, No. 4 (Autumn, 1980), pp. 521-550 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/286349 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was widely praised, but was criticised by some&lt;ref&gt;Ted W. Margadant, "French Rural Society in the Nineteenth Century: A Review Essay," ''Agricultural History,'' Summer 1979, Vol. 53 Issue 3, pp 644-651&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that a sense of Frenchness existed in the provinces before 1870.

====Greece====
The modernising force of the post-civil war Greek society came primarily as a result of the European and US geopolitical strategy for the region of eastern Mediterranean. Greece ought to be a modern capitalistic state to counter the proximity of several eastern and third world bloc countries and the strong [[Communist Party of Greece|national communist movement]]. According to [[Truman doctrine]] and with the support of local elites, a great economical  leap forward took place along with the severe repression that led to the 1967 coup d'état.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore A. Couloumbis, Greece in the Twentieth Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kostis Moskof, Isagogika shri istovia ton kinimatos tis evgatis taxis&lt;/ref&gt;
This dramatic change covered the long-standing cultural divide of greek academia, comparing modern and [[neo-greek]] to ancient and traditional identities. Music, art and [[cinema of greece|cinema]], influenced by the pioneers of American and European tendencies thrived,&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Papadimitriou and Yannis Tzioumakis, Greek Cinema&lt;/ref&gt; until the milestone of 1967, in contrast to the [[authoritarian]] and  [[tradition]]alist military and paramilitary structures. This dimension is vital as it reveals the process of modernisation under the western directives in all social levels that came in fact in opposition to the political directives of the same source.&lt;ref&gt;A. Papachelas, The rape of greek democracy: The American Factor, 1947-1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
Many studies of modernisation have focused on the [[history of Japan]] in the [[Meiji period|late 19th]] century,&lt;ref&gt;Shuzo Teruoka, ed. ''Agriculture in the Modernization of Japan, 1850-2000'' (2008); Cyril Black, ''The Modernization of Japan and Russia'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[China]] and [[India]] in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russell H. Jeffries, ''China's Agricultural Modernization'' (2009); June Grasso, Jay Cornin, and Michael Kort, ''Modernization and Revolution in China: From the Opium Wars to the Olympics'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the process of borrowing science and technology from the West has been explored.

====China====
Modernisation theory failed to explain the experience of China. Mao modernised the People's Republic of China with massive industrialisation projects and social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eberstadt|first=Nick|title=Did Mao Fail?|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|year=1980|volume=4|series=4|pages=120–133|jstor=40256004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, China did not become a democratic country after its modernisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=Shaohua|title=Balancing Development and Democracy: DENG'S ROLE IN THE CHINESE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS|journal=World Affairs|year=1998|volume=161|series=2|pages=69–81|jstor=20672544}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Nowadays, even though the Soviet-style authoritarian regimes have already collapsed worldwide, China did not have any major political reforms after Mao's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garver|first=John W.|title=The Chinese Communist Party and the Collapse of Soviet Communism|journal=The China Quarterly|year=1993|pages=1–26|jstor=654237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country remained authoritarian, despite the size of its economic sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Baogang|author2=Mark E.

China has been attempting to modernise ever since the [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution of 1911]] and the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]], the last dynasty of China. Before the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, it attempted to reform from 1902 to 1908 to save itself and instigated reforms in infrastructure, transportation, and government. These reforms were based on Western models and even included aspects of democracy, which are often associated with the process of modernisation. However, these reforms were largely unsuccessful and resulted in the Revolution of 1911. Following the Revolution of 1911, other movements such as the [[May 4th Movement]] of 1919 advocated for modernisation, [[iconoclasm]], and a rejection of foreign influence and [[imperialism]]. From the beginning of the 20th century until the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, China has been delayed in efforts to modernise due to an era of warlordism, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and civil war between the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] and [[KMT]].&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"&gt;{{cite book|title=Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern China|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|edition=Third|editor=R. Keith Schoppa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardels|first=Nathan|title=The West No Longer Owns Modernity|journal=New Perspect|year=2011|volume=28|issue=3|pages=61–64|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5842.2011.01271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the communist party came to power in 1949, [[Mao Zedong]] used the Soviet Union as China’s example for modernisation. [[The Great Leap Forward]] from 1958-1961 was Mao’s version of the Soviet Union’s [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five year Plan]], and its goals were to create a modern communist society through industrialisation and collectivisation. Mao Zedong aimed to become a world power without foreign, mainly western, involvement, ideas, or capitalism and preached the idea of self-reliance. Mao did contribute to the modernisation of China, however The Great Leap Forward is regarded as a failure and the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976 was detrimental to China's industrialisation progress.&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt; [[File:Shanghai-pudong panorama.jpg|thumb|The Modern Chinese City of [[Shanghai]]]] However, during Mao's era, he transformed China from a predominantly agrarian country to an industrialised power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=476–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, China was able to produce most of commodities and goods by its own industry. Mao laid the foundation for China's economic development in Deng's era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tsui |first1=Anne S. |last2=Schoonhoven |first2=Claudia Bird |last3=Meyer |first3=Marshall W. |last4=Lau |first4=Chung-Ming |last5=Milkovich |first5=George T. |title=Organization and Management in the Midst of Societal Transformation: The People's Republic of China |journal=Organization Science |year=2004 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=133–144 |jstor=30034719 |doi=10.1287/orsc.1040.0063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic reforms of Chinese Supreme Leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] are attributed to China’s economic success in the 21st century. Deng focused on four modernisations: agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology. The West was used as an example for several of these modernisations, however their management was completely Chinese. Deng began de-collectivisation and allowed [[Township and Village Enterprise]]s (TVE), [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZ), foreign investment, profit incentive, and even privatisation.

While Mao advocated self-reliance, Deng generated foreign exchange to finance modernisation. His famous quote is, "It doesn’t matter whether a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice." Post Deng Reforms continued on this path, which is acknowledged as a shift from the [[iron rice bowl]] to the porcelain rice bowl, or government owned to privatised. Although China’s economy has shifted towards privatisation and capitalism, the PRC remains an authoritative regime, which is contradictory in comparison to other examples of countries that have modernised. Democracy is the political characteristic that has defined modernised nations in the past and the modernisation theory suggests democracy follows with the development of a modernised state.&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"/&gt; China was late in modernisation and has thus had many other countries as examples to base its model of modernisation off of.&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt;

The [[One-Child Policy]] has also been a technique to contribute or even force the modernisation of China. Instigated in 1978, the one-child policy has created a generation known as "singletons" or "little emperors" (''xiao huangdi'').&lt;ref name="Little Emperors"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feeding China's Little Emperors:Food Children and Social Change|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|editor=Jun Jing}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Chinese state enforced a rapid fertility transition designed to cultivate a generation of "high-quality" people with resources and ambition to join the global elite."&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fong|first=Vanessa|title=Only Hope: Coming of Age under China's One-Child Policy|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|page=17|isbn=978-0804753302}}&lt;/ref&gt; These little emperors are expected to compete with the first-world countries having no siblings to compete with for parental investment. Normally with modernisation and urbanisation smaller or [[nuclear family|nuclear families]] evolve as the result. China has switched this logic, hoping that creating the culture of the nuclear family with the one-child policy it will produce modernisation.&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"/&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century, China is still in the process of modernisation. In 2010 it had the third greatest GDP and GDP (PPP) in the world with the world’s largest labour force, and is acknowledged as the world’s second largest economy.&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact Book"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html|work=East and Southeast Asia: China|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 its economy was still increasing in growth at 10.3%.&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact Book"/&gt; China has also successfully joined the largely Western international arena with its membership of the [[United Nations|UN]] in 1971, the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] in 2001, and hosted the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in 2008. China’s goal is to continue modernising until it joins the first-world and becomes the core instead of the semi-periphery or periphery, from the [[core-periphery| core-periphery model]].&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"/&gt;

The modernisation of China through urbanisation, industrialisation, and economic policy has benefited the country economically as it rises as a world power in the 21st century. However it now is experiencing the problems associated the other modern countries and capitalism. These problems include the growing disparity between the rich and poor, urban vs. rural and migration, and ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowntree|first=Lester|title=Diversity Amid Globalization: World Regions, Environment, Development|year=2008|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-600554-4|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korea====
Modernisers in [[South Korea]] in the late 19th century were torn between the American and the Japanese models. Most of the Koreans involved were educated Christians who saw America as their ideal model of civilisation. However, most used Japan as a practical model - as an example of how a fellow East Asian country, which 30 years before was also backward, could succeed in modernising itself. At the same time, reformists' nationalist reaction against the domineering, colonial behaviour of the Japanese in Korea often took the form of an appeal to international (Western) standards of civilisation. The Western-oriented worldview of the early Christian nationalist reformers was complex, multilayered, and often self-contradictory - with 'oppressive' features not easily distinguishable from 'liberational' ones. Their idealised image of the West as the only true, ideal civilisation relegated much of Korea's traditional culture to a position of 'oriental'.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Tikhonov, "The 1890s Korean Reformers' View of Japan - a Menacing Model?" ''International Journal of Asian Studies'' 2005 2(1): 57-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-image of Koreans was formed through complex relationships with modernity, colonialism, Christianity, and nationalism. This formation was initiated by a change in the notion of 'civilisation' due to the transformation of 'international society' and thereafter was affected by the trauma of Japanese colonisation. Through the process of transition from a traditional Confucian notion of civilisation to a Western notion of acceptance and resistance, Koreans shaped their civilisation as well as their notions of the racial, cultural, and individual modern self. Western Orientalism, in particular, accompanied the introduction of the Western notion of civilisation, which served as the background for forming the self-identity of Koreans. The fact that the Japanese version of [[Orientalism]] emerged from the domination of Korea by Japan played a critical role in shaping the self-identity of Koreans. Consequently, Korea still maintains an inferiority complex toward Western culture, ambivalent feelings toward Japanese culture, and biased - positive or negative - views of their own cultural traditions. Thus both modernisation and colonisation have shaped the formation or distortion of self-consciousness of non-Western peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Yong-hwa Chung, "The Modern Transformation of Korean Identity: Enlightenment and Orientalism," ''Korea Journal'' 2006 46(1): 109-138&lt;/ref&gt;

The US launched a decades-long intensive development starting in 1945 to modernise South Korea, with the goal of helping it become a model nation-state and an economic success. Agents of modernisation at work in Korea included the US Army, the Economic Cooperation Administration, the UN Korean Reconstruction Agency, and a number of nongovernmental organisations, among them the Presbyterian Church, the [[YMCA]], Boy Scouts and the [[Ford Foundation]].   Many Koreans migrated to California and Hawaii, and brought back firsthand accounts of modern business and governmental practices that they sought to adapt to Korean conditions.&lt;ref&gt;David Ekbladh, "How to Build a Nation," ''Wilson Quarterly'' 2004 28(1): 12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
Modernisation theory was not compatible with Japan's experience. After industrialisation and economic modernisation, a democratic society did not appear in Japan. Japan instead became an aggressive authoritarian fascist state, up until the Allied Forces defeated Japan in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=Mary Elizabeth|title=Public Life in Authoritarian Japan|journal=Daedalus|year=1998|volume=127|series=3|pages=133–165|jstor=20027510}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were almost no democratic principles or practices in pre-war Japanese politics. Prior to the liberation of Japan by the United States from its military government, Japanese culture always honoured obedience and hierarchy, and Japanese people also despised individualism and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=Thomas U.|title=From Sword to Chrysanthemum: Japan's Culture of Anti-militarism|journal=International Security|year=1993|volume=17|issue=4|series=4|pages=119–150|jstor=2539024|doi=10.2307/2539024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had already modernised and became an industrialised country during its Meiji period, which happened long before Japan's defeat in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=La Follette|first=Philip F. |author2=Edward M. Coffman |author3=Paul H. Hass|title=With MacArthur in the Pacific: A Memoir by Philip F. La Follette|journal=The Wisconsin Magazine of History|date=1980–1981|volume=64|series=2|pages=82–106|jstor=4635497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was probably the first country in East Asia that industrialised successfully. It quickly became one of the imperialist and colonial powers. Japan defeated the Qing dynasty of China in 1894, and subsequently defeated Russia in 1905. Korea and Taiwan were annexed by the Japanese Empire later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuels|first=Richard J.|title=Reinventing Security: Japan since Meiji|journal=Daedalus|year=1991|volume=120|series=4|pages=47–68|jstor=20025403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Japan invaded China in 1931, it had already finished its industrialising process and had enough industrial power to wage a war itself. Japan's navy was among one of the world's most advanced navies, with almost no challenger in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamamura|first=Kozo|title=Success Illgotten? The Role of Meiji Militarism in Japan's Technological Progress|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=1977|volume=37|series=1|pages=113–135|jstor=2119450|doi=10.1017/s0022050700096777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of Japan after the Second War was simply a result of the military supremacy of the United States. The United States absolutely ruled over Japan after its defeat, with General MacArthur as the de facto emperor of Japan at the time. Japan had no choice but listen to the orders of General MacArthur and his colleagues. In order to be compatible with the foreign policy and national interest of the United States, SCAP and General MacArthur forced Japan to demilitarise and democratise after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitahara|first=Michio|title=Douglas MacArthur as a Father Figure in Occupied Japan After World War II|journal=International Social Science  Review|year=1989|volume=64|series=1|pages=20–28|jstor=41881853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan quickly went through a lot of changes concerning modernisation after their defeat. This happened starting with United States quickly intervening with Japan internally. American demilitarisation and democratisation was accepted by the people of Japan without strong resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=461–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the occupation of United States, SCAP ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]]) was established, which was an institution in charge of formulating policies. The goal of SCAP was to dissolve the army and navy, and also to punish responsible leaders, and it established the New constitution of 1946.&lt;ref name="Modern Japan"&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of Modern Japan|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCAP could not function without the assistance of Japanese government because the language barrier was too high. However, this actually helped make bigger changes in creating demilitarisation and democratisation.  SCAP helped people to gain freedoms of speech, press and the right to organise labour or farmer unions.

As such, the new constitution created by SCAP granted civil and political rights to the people; consequently, leading to modernisation. It also allowed freedom of speech and association, right to organise labour association and movements, or create unions, and implemented grounds for incredible civil right for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=460–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government also held an important role in modernising Japan. Japan concentrated on their industry and technology to achieve growth. For that, the state gave assistances to several industries and adopted protectionism policies. Government stepped in as lender, as facilitator of access to foreign exchange, raw materials, or technology licenses, and as rescuer when problems arise.&lt;ref name="Modern Japan"&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of Modern Japan|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate, the most important guiding agency was the [[MITI]] (Ministry of International Trade and Industry). In addition, through the 1960s, Japanese government used economic policies such as tariffs to obstruct imports and protect Japanese firms from foreign competitors in domestic market to become a modernised country.

====Turkey====
[[Turkey]], under [[Kemal Atatürk]] in the 1920s and 1930s, engaged in a systematic modernisation programme [[Atatürk's Reforms|called "Kemalism"]]. Hundreds of European scholars came to help. Together with Turkish intellectuals they developed a successful model of development.&lt;ref&gt;Craig C. Hansen, "Are We Doing Theory Ethnocentrically? A Comparison of Modernization Theory and Kemalism," ''Journal of Developing Societies'' (0169796X), 1989, Vol. 5 Issue 2, pp 175-187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murat Ergin, "Cultural encounters in the social sciences and humanities: western émigré scholars in Turkey," ''History of the Human Sciences,'' Feb 2009, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp 105-130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Reisman, ''Turkey's Modernization: Refugees from Nazism and Atatürk's Vision'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ward and Dankwart Rustow, eds. ''Political Modernization in Japan and Turkey'' (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
Since independence, modernisation has been a driving force for [[Chile]]'s political elites. Ree (2007) analyses projects of modernisation that have been implemented from above since 1964. Despite their ideological differences and very different understandings of what modernity is, these projects shared key characteristics in their construction and implementation, such as the use of developmental theories, their state-orientation, the prominent role of technocrats and state-planning, and the capacity of adaptation in sight of civil unrest. These projects have produced patterns of modernity that have proven particularly stable.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Van Der Ree, "Modernisation in Chile: from the 'Revolution in Liberty' to 'Growth with Equity'," ''Bicentenario: Revista De Historia De Chile Y America'' 2007 6(2): 39-69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Modernisation has been attributed with creating positive development around the world, but in Modern times its ability to promote development, specifically in [[Africa]], has been less than so.  Modernisation that has taken place in Africa can be described as something that has yet to benefit most of the African countries.

Modernisation through development has led to problems in [[Nigeria]] by bringing in private, foreign owned oil companies that have been exploiting the natural resource wealth of the country.  Because the oil companies are generally owned by a different nation, the profits are mostly being exported from Nigeria with only one fifteenth of the wealth produced in the region returning to it.  Shell, the oil company operating in Ogoniland, Nigeria has helped the country develop and industrialise on a small scale, but it has primarily challenged the sovereignty and autonomy of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogowski|first=edited by Patrick O'Neil, Ronald|title=Essential readings in comparative politics|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-93401-4|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of scholars view modernisation as a sort of westernisation where western institutions such as national parks and industries are brought into existing cultures where their use does not make as much sense.  Along with modernisation comes a loss of culture and society, and the individual is strengthened. An African tribe known as the Ik was forced to change their habits due to modernisation and the creation of individual countries caused by colonialism. Nationalisation, as a tool of modernisation, was imparted on Africa by colonialists who wanted to westernise and modernise tribal Africa.  The creation of individual countries made life for the tribal Ik more difficult because they were forced out of their nomadic lifestyle into a settlement based around a newly founded national park that practically destroyed their livelihood by restricting their hunting grounds to specific non-park areas.  The creation of national parks have increased cultivation, which can be seen as good development because people no longer depend solely  on livestock.  This creation of a new sort of livelihood has mixed improvements, because the tribal setting is not removed, but is put into a single place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turbull|first=Colin M.|title=The Mountain People|year=1972|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hybrid algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that combines two or more other algorithms that solve the same problem, either choosing one (depending on the data), or switching between them over the course of the algorithm. This is generally done to combine desired features of each, so that the overall algorithm is better than the individual components.

"Hybrid algorithm" does not refer to simply combining multiple algorithms to solve a different problem – many algorithms can be considered as combinations of simpler pieces – but only to combining algorithms that solve the same problem, but differ in other characteristics, notably performance.

==Examples==
In [[computer science]], hybrid algorithms are very common in optimized real-world implementations of [[recursive algorithm]]s, particularly [[Divide and conquer algorithm#Implementation issues|implementations]] of 
[[divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]] or [[decrease and conquer]] algorithms, where the size of the data decreases as one moves deeper in the recursion. In this case, one algorithm is used for the overall approach (on large data), but deep in the recursion, it switches to a different algorithm, which is more efficient on small data. A common example is in [[sorting algorithm]]s, where the insertion sort, which is inefficient on large data, but very efficient on small data (say, five to ten elements), is used as the final step, after primarily applying another algorithm, such as [[merge sort]] or [[quicksort]]. Merge sort and quicksort are asymptotically optimal on large data, but the overhead becomes significant if applying them to small data, hence the use of a different algorithm at the end of the recursion. A highly optimized hybrid sorting algorithm is [[Timsort]], which combines merge sort, insertion sort, together with additional logic (including [[binary search]]) in the merging logic.

A general procedure for a simple hybrid recursive algorithm is ''short-circuiting the base case,'' also known as ''[[arm's-length recursion]].'' In this case whether the next step will result in the base case is checked before the function call, avoiding an unnecessary function call. For example, in a tree, rather than recursing to a child node and then checking if it is null, checking null before recursing. This is useful for efficiency when the algorithm usually encounters the base case many times, as in many tree algorithms, but is otherwise considered poor style, particularly in academia, due to the added complexity.

Another example of hybrid algorithms for performance reasons are [[introsort]] and [[introselect]], which combine one algorithm for fast average performance, falling back on another algorithm to ensure (asymptotically) optimal worst-case performance. Introsort begins with a [[quicksort]], but switches to a [[heap sort]] if quicksort is not progressing well; analogously introselect begins with [[quickselect]], but switches to [[median of medians]] if quickselect is not progressing well.

Centralized [[distributed algorithm]]s can often be considered as hybrid algorithms, consisting of an individual algorithm (run on each distributed processor), and a combining algorithm (run on a centralized distributor) – these correspond respectively to running the entire algorithm on one processor, or running the entire computation on the distributor, combining trivial results (a one-element data set from each processor). A basic example of these algorithms are [[distribution sort]]s, particularly used for [[external sorting]], which divide the data into separate subsets, sort the subsets, and then combine the subsets into totally sorted data; examples include [[bucket sort]] and [[flashsort]].

However, in general distributed algorithms need not be hybrid algorithms, as individual algorithms or combining or communication algorithms may be solving different problems. For example, in models such as [[MapReduce]], the Map and Reduce step solve different problems, and are combined to solve a different, third problem.

[[File:Hypervelocity Impact.png|thumb|Hypervelocity impact]]

'''Hypervelocity''' is very high [[velocity]], approximately over 3,000 [[metre per second|meters per second]] (6,700&amp;nbsp;mph, 11,000&amp;nbsp;km/h, 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s, or [[Mach number|Mach]] 8.8). In particular, hypervelocity is velocity so high that the strength of materials upon impact is very small compared to [[inertia]]l stresses.&lt;ref Name="AIAA"&gt;{{cite book

Extreme hypervelocity results in [[vaporize|vaporization]] of the [[impact force|impactor]] and target. For structural metals, hypervelocity is generally considered to be over 2,500&amp;nbsp;m/s (5,600&amp;nbsp;mph, 9,000&amp;nbsp;km/h, 8,200&amp;nbsp;ft/s, or Mach 7.3).  [[Meteorite]] [[impact crater|crater]]s are also examples of hypervelocity impacts.

==Overview==
"Hypervelocity" refers to velocities in the range from a few kilometers per [[second]] to some tens of kilometers per second. This is especially relevant in the field of [[space exploration]] and military use of space, where hypervelocity impacts (e.g. by [[space debris]] or an attacking [[projectile]]) can result in anything from minor component degradation to the complete destruction of a [[spacecraft]] or missile. The impactor, as well as the surface it hits, can undergo temporary [[liquefaction]]. The impact process can generate [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] discharges, which can interfere with spacecraft electronics.

Hypervelocity usually occurs during [[meteor shower]]s and deep space reentries, as carried out during the [[Zond program|Zond]], [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Luna programme|Luna]] programs. Given the intrinsic unpredictability of the timing and trajectories of meteors, space capsules are prime data gathering opportunities for the study of thermal protection materials at hypervelocity (in this context, hypervelocity is defined as greater than [[escape velocity]]). Given the rarity of such observation opportunities since the 1970s, the [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]] and [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] Sample Return Capsule (SRC) reentries as well as the recent [[Hayabusa]] SRC reentry have spawned observation campaigns, most notably at [[NASA Ames Research Center]].

Hypervelocity [[collision]]s can be studied by examining the results of naturally occurring collisions (between [[micrometeoroid|micrometeorites]] and spacecraft, or between meteorites and planetary bodies), or they may be performed in laboratories. Currently the primary tool for laboratory experiments is a [[light-gas gun]], but some experiments have used [[linear motor]]s to accelerate projectiles to hypervelocity. The properties of metals under hypervelocity have been integrated with weapons, such as [[explosively formed penetrator]]. The vaporization upon impact and liquefaction of surfaces allow metal projectiles formed under hypervelocity forces to penetrate vehicle armor better than conventional bullets.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects smaller than a softball cannot be detected on radar. This has prompted spacecraft designers to develop shields to protect spacecraft from unavoidable collisions. At RHTL, [[micrometeoroid]] and [[orbital debris]] (MMOD) impacts are simulated on spacecraft components and shields allowing designers to test threats posed by the growing orbital debris environment and evolve shield technology to stay one step ahead. At RHTL, four two-stage light-gas guns propel 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm to 22.2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter projectiles to velocities as fast as 8.5&amp;nbsp;km/s.

==Other definitions of hypervelocity==
According to the [[United States Army]], ''hypervelocity'' can also refer to the [[muzzle velocity]] of a weapon system, with the exact definition dependent upon the weapon in question.  When discussing [[small arms]] a muzzle velocity of 5,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1524&amp;nbsp;m/s) or greater is considered hypervelocity, while for [[tank]] [[cannons]] the muzzle velocity must meet or exceed 3,350&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1021.08&amp;nbsp;m/s) to be considered hypervelocity, and the threshold for [[artillery]] cannons is 3,500&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1066.8&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref Name="DA"&gt;{{cite web

'''Implicit cognition''' refers to unconscious influences such as [[knowledge]], [[perception]], or [[memory]], that influence a person's [[behavior]], even though they themselves have no conscious awareness whatsoever of those influences.&lt;ref name="ReingoldRay2006"/&gt;

==Overview==
Implicit cognition is everything one does and learns unconsciously or without any awareness that one is doing it. An example of implicit cognition could be when a person first learns to ride a bike: at first they are aware that they are learning the required skills. After having stopped for many years, when the person starts to ride the bike again they do not have to relearn the motor skills required, as their implicit knowledge of the motor skills&lt;ref name=Baddeley1997/&gt; takes over and they can just start riding the bike as if they had never stopped. In other words, they do not have to think about the actions that they are performing in order to ride the bike. It can be seen with this example that implicit cognition is involved with many of the different mental activities and everyday situations of people's daily lives.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; There are many processes in which implicit memory works, which include learning, our social cognition, and our problem solving skills.

==History==
Implicit cognition was first discovered in the year of 1649 by [[Descartes]] in his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]''. He said in one of his writings that he saw that unpleasant childhood experiences remain imprinted in a child's brain until its death without any conscious memory of it remaining.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; Even though this idea was never accepted by any of his peers, in 1704 [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in his ''[[New Essays Concerning Human Understanding]]'' stressed the importance of unconscious perceptions which he said were the ideas that we are not consciously aware of yet still influence people's behavior.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; He claimed that people have residual effects of prior impressions without any remembrance of them. In 1802&lt;!--Schachter 1987 incorrectly gives 1804, but the book was published in 1802--&gt; French philosopher [[Maine de Biran]] in his ''The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking'' was the first person after Leibniz to systematically discuss implicit memory stating that after enough repetition, a habit can become automatic or completed without any conscious awareness.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; In 1870 [[Ewald Hering]] said that it was essential to consider unconscious memory, which is involved in involuntary recall, and the development of automatic and unconscious habitual actions.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt;

==Implicit learning==
Implicit learning starts in our early childhood, this means that people are not able to learn the proper grammar and rules to speaking a language until the age of seven. So if this is the case then how do we learn to talk by the age of four? One of the ways that this is possible is through implicit learning and association. Children learn their first language from what they hear when they are listening to the adults and through their own talking activities.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; This goes to show that the way children learn language involves implicit learning.

===Studies on implicit learning===
A study was conducted with amnesiac patients in an attempt to demonstrate that amnesiac patients that were unable to learn a list of words or pictures when their performance was tested were able to complete or put together fragmented words and incomplete pictures. This was found to be true as the patients were able to perform better when asked to complete words or pictures. A possible explanation for this could be that implicit memory should be less susceptible to damage that may happen to the brain than explicit memory.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; There was a case where a 54-year-old man that had bitemporal damage worse on the right side had a hard time remembering things from his own life as well as famous events, names and even; yet he was able to perform within the normal limits with a word completion task involving famous names and with judgments of famous faces.&lt;ref name=Baddeley2002/&gt; This is a prime example that implicit memory can be less vulnerable to brain damage.

A famous study investigated the Identification blindsight effect with individuals who had suffered damage to one half of the visual cortex and were blind in the opposite half of the visual field.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; It was discovered that when objects or pictures were shown to these blind areas, the participants said that they saw no object or picture, but a certain number were able to identify the stimulus as either a cross or circle when asked to guess at a considerably higher rate than would have been expected by chance.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; The reason that this happened is because the information was able to be process through the first three stages of selection, organization, and interpretation or comprehension of the perceptual cycle but failed at only the last stage of retention and memory where the identified image is entered into their awareness. Thus stimuli can enter implicit memory even when people are unable to consciously perceive them.

==Implicit social relations==
Implicit cognition also plays a role in social cognition. People tend to see objects and individuals as more encouraging or acceptable the more often&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; that people are exposed to them. An example includes the False-fame Effect.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; Graf and Masson (1993) conducted a study where they showed participants a list with both famous and non-famous names. When it was shown around people were able to recall the famous names more than the non-famous names initially, but after about a 24-hour delay participants began to associate the non-famous names with famous people. This supports implicit cognition because the participants began to unconsciously associate the non-famous names with famous people.

Although the process is unconscious, implicit cognition influences how people view each other as well as their interactions with one another. People tend to view those who look alike as belonging together or to similar groups&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; and associate them with the social groups that existed in their high school years. These groups represented different relations between the students and were made up of students who were perceived as having similarities among each other. 
A study was conducted to see the amount of distance that participants put between individuals given certain circumstances. The participants were asked to place figures of individuals where they thought the figures should be standing given certain circumstances. It was found that people typically place men and women close to each other, to make little families formed with the figures of a woman, a man and of children.&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; The participants did the same when asked to show friends and/or acquaintances, the two figures were placed relatively close to one another rather than if they were asked to represent strangers. When asked to represent strangers the participants placed the figures far apart. There are two parts to the social relations view that is liking relations were the ultimate goal is to be together, then there is the disliking relation view which is separation from the person.&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; An example of this could be when someone is walking down a hall way and see someone whom they know and like that person is more likely to wave and say hello to them. On the other hand, say the person they see is someone whom they dislike, their response will be the opposite as they try to either avoid them or get away from them as quickly as possible showing the separation between the two of them. There are two views to the social relations theory, one of them is that people are out to mainly seek dominance of those around them, while the other view is that people mainly see the relations as either belonging or not belonging or liking and disliking on another. It is seen that males mainly seek dominance against one another as they are competitive and looking to outdo one another. For females on the other hand it is seen that women perceive their social views and values as more of the belonging or liking scale in terms of their closeness to one another. Implicit cognition not only involved how people view each other but also how they view themselves. This means that our own image is constructed from what others see of us&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; rather than our own views. The way that we view ourselves is from what others see us as, or from the times that we compare ourselves to other people.  The way that this plays a role in implicit cognition is because all of these actions people do unconsciously, or they are unaware that they are making these decision. Men do not consciously seek to be dominant over one another as women do not consciously arrange their social views or values in terms of their closeness. These are each things that people do without their conscious knowledge of these actions, which ties in with implicit cognition.

==Implicit behaviors==
{{tone|section|date=May 2016}}
There are scenarios when we act on something and then think back about handling it in different situation or manner. That is implicit cognition coming into play, the mind will then go based off ethical and similar situations when interacting with a certain thought. Implicit cognition and its automated thought process allows a person to decide something out of impulse. It is often defined as an involuntary process where tasks are easily absent of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, P, &amp; Schacter, D, L., (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; There are plenty of factors that influence behaviors and thought processes. Such as social learning, to stigmas, and two major aspects of implicit and explicit cognition. Implicit on one hand is obtained through social aspects and association, while explicit cognition is gained through propositional attitudes or beliefs of certain thoughts,&lt;ref&gt;Gawronski, B, &amp; Bodenhausen, G, V., (2006); Wilson, T. D., Lindsey, S., &amp; Schooler, T. Y. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit cognition can be incorporated with a mixture of attention, goals, self-association, and at times even motivational processes. Researchers have used different methods to test these theories of behavior correlation with implicit cognition. Using Implicit Association Tests (ITA's) is a method that is significantly used, according to Fazio &amp; Olsen (2003) and Richetin &amp; Richardson (2008). Since published, approximately ten years or so, it has been widely used influencing research on implicit attitudes. Implicit cognition is a process based off automatic mental interpretations. It's what a person really thinks, yet is not consciously aware of. Behavior is then affected, usually causing negative influences, both theoretically and empirical reasons presume that automatic cognitive processes are contributed to aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C, A., et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Impulse behaviors are often created without awareness. Negativity is a characteristic of implicit cognition, since it is an automated response. Explicit cognition is rarely used when trying to discover behavior of ones thought process. Researchers again use IAT's to determine ones thoughts and how a person incorporates these automatic processes, findings consider that implicit cognition may direct what behaviors a person may choose when facing extreme stimuli. For example, death can be perceived as positive, negative, or a combination of the two.  Depending on the attributes of death, it can include a general perspective or a "me" attribute. {{harvtxt|Nock et al.|2010}} implied that implicit association with death and or suicide initiates a final process when deciding how to cope to these extreme measures. Self- harm is another characteristic associated with implicit cognition. Because although we may think of it, it is controlled subconsciously. IAT's showed that there was a stronger correlation of implicit cognition and death/suicide than self-harm. The idea of pain may influence a person to think twice, while suicidal may seem quick, thus the automatic process can show how effective this negative behavior and implicit cognition come hand in hand. Automated processes doesn't allow a person to thoroughly create a conscious choice, therefore creating negative influence to behavior. Another negative behavior that can be associated with implicit cognition is depression. Whether a person takes a positive or negative outlook on the certain situation can produce if a person will be associated with depression. It is easier to determine an implicit mindset simple because it is outside of awareness. Implicit processes are considered critical when determining a person's reactions to a certain schema. Implicit cognition is often immediately affective towards a person's reaction.{{sfn|Haeffel et al.|2007}} Implicit cognitions also consisted of negative schemas that included hidden cognitive frameworks, and activation of stress. Awareness was often misinterpreted and implicit cognition emerged because of these negative schemas.&lt;ref&gt;(Scher, C, D., Ingram, R, E., &amp; Sega S, V., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors merged through implicit cognition involve a variety of addictive behaviors, problematic thinking, depression, aggression, suicide, death, and other negative factors. Certain life situations add to this schema, whether it be stressful situations, sudden, or anything along these lines, aspects of implicit cognition are used and evaluated.

Implicit cognition can also be associated with mental illness and the way thoughts are processed. Automatic stigmas and attitudes may anticipate other cognitive and behavior tendencies. A person with mental illness may be correlated with a guilt-related, self-associated personality.&lt;ref&gt;Dovidio, J, F., et al., (2002) &amp; Greenwald, A, G., et al., (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these associations it may be managed outside one's own control and awareness, showing how implicit cognition is affected. However a dual process can be assessed within implicit and explicit cognition. An agreement between the two thought processes may be an issue, explicit may not be in contact with implicit, therefore causing more of a problem. Mental illness can include both implicit and explicit attitudes, however implicit self-concepts gave more negative consequence when dealing with mental illness. Much of implicit problems happened to be associated with alcohol, however this isn't the goal in order to describe a mental process and implicit cognition. The most widely influenced mental illness in association with implicit cognition would be Schizophrenia. Since a person of this illness has a problem of detecting what is real and what is not, implicit memory is often used with these patients. However, since it cannot really be detected if it is emotionally, mentally, or a combination of both some aspects of this illness are usually exercised uninterrupted, and unconsciously.{{sfn|Mano|Brown|2013}} Since schizophrenia is widely varied and has different characteristics, we cannot quite measure the outcome of implicit cognition.

==Definition==
Implicit cognition refers to perceptual, memory, comprehension, and performance processes that occur through unconscious awareness.{{sfn|Sun|2001}} For example, when a patient is discharged after a surgery, the effects of the anesthesia can cause abnormal behaviors without any conscious awareness. According to Wiers et al. (2006) some scholars argue implicit cognition is misinterpreted and could be used to improve behaviors while others highlight the dangers of it. Research studies have shown implicit cognition is a strong predictor for several issues like substance abuse, misconduct, and mental disorders.{{sfn|Wiers|Stacy|2006b}} These inherent thoughts are influenced from early adolescent experiences primarily a negative impact from culture. Adolescents who experience a rough childhood early on develop low levels of self-esteem. Therefore, the cognition to act dangerously is an oblivious development. Research for implicit cognition has started to grow especially within mental disorders.

==In mental disorders==
Schemas are used to interpret the functions involved when individuals would make sense of their surroundings. This cognition happens through an explicit process of recalling an item routinely or implicit process that is outside conscious awareness control. A recent study suggests individuals who have experienced a difficult upbringing develop schemata of fear as well as anxiety and will react almost immediately when they feel threatened. People who are anxious predominantly focus on any peril-related stimuli since they are hyper vigilant. For example, an anxious individual who is about to cross the street at the same time a car drives to a stop sign. The anxious person will automatically assume the driver will not stop. This is recognition of threat through a semantic process that instantaneously occurs. Ambiguous cues are viewed as a threat since there is no relevant knowledge to make sense of. People will have a difficult time to understand and will respond negatively.  This kind of behavior can explain how implicit cognition may be an influence for pathological anxiety.

The ideas of psychotic patients who have low self-esteem are prone to more serious illnesses. This concept was examined through both implicit and explicit perspectives by measuring the self-esteem of paranoia and depression patients. Previous research suggests that negative implicit cognition is not the symptoms for depression and paranoia, but it is an antecedent for the onset. Current research proposes that high implicit self-esteem is linked to less paranoia.{{sfn|Valiente et al.|2011}} It is imperative for patients who have low self-esteem to become more overt about these situations. Another study found a substantial association between adverse self-questioning in implicit cognition and depression.  People who do not think highly of themselves are more likely to be depressed because of this involuntary implicit learning.

Implicit cognition is another influential predictor for bipolar disorder and unipolar disorder. Research proposes patients with bipolar disorder show more common implicit and depressive self-referencing than unipolar patients. Implicit cognition plays a strong role for patients with both bipolar and unipolar disorder. These patients have dysfunctional self-schemata, which is viewed as vulnerability for potential illnesses. Patients who have this vulnerability usually do not seek mental assistance which can later become more problematic to treat. Bipolar disorder patients with low implicit self-esteem are more defensive. This is an unconscious reaction to be manic protective when they feel threatened in any way.
Since the growing research of implicit cognition is associated with abnormalities, researchers attempted to find a connection between implicit neuroticism and schizophrenia. Indeed, there was a correlation; participants with schizophrenia were high in implicit neuroticism and low in implicit extraversion when compared to people who were mentally healthy. Participants were given questionnaires that ask personality questions such as "I enjoy being the center of attention". Implicit cognition constitutes low levels of extraversion because these participants are known to avoid any coping. Schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals differ in associative representation pertaining to themselves in neuroticism features.  People who are schizophrenic develop an implicit learning, meaning they have an error free learning style so they never take feedback from anyone else.

Research on suicide can be a difficult process because suicidal patients are commonly covert about their intentions to avoid hospitalization. An implicit cognition associated self-task was applied in one experiment to unveil any suspicious behavior of people who might attempt suicide. This study found patients who were released from mental hospitals showed significant implicit association to attempt suicide. The Implicit Association Task would predict whether a patient was likely to attempt suicide depending on they respond. An individual's implicit cognition may lead to a behavior to best cope with stress. This behavior may be suicide, substance abuse, or even violence. However, implicit association with death will show those most at risk for attempting suicide because this individual is looking for the best solution for ending their stress.

==Task performed==
Implicit cognition is measured in different ways to find the most accurate outcomes. The task used for patients with anxiety disorders was a modified Stroop task to observe attention biases in anxiety. A participant's reaction time was measured by the reported color of each word. Participants would name the color for each risk relevant words and risk irrelevant words and depending on the color of each word might slow the reaction time. Colors like red were used to see if anxious participants would have a slower reaction time. These colors are known as aposematic implying a threat warning. Most studies used the Implicit Association Test which varies for each study. For example, implicit self-esteem can be tested by giving participants questionnaires that are self-referent.  These ask questions like "I am known to be suicidal".  Depending on the response of the participants, the researcher can assessed the current state for each participant. Patients that were rated high in suicide immediately received psychiatric treatment. According to these experiments implicit cognition may be a strong predictor for mental disorders.

In [[intuitionistic type theory]] (ITT), some discipline within [[mathematical logic]], '''induction-induction''' is for simultaneously declaring some inductive type and some inductive predicate over this type.

An [[inductive definition]] is given by rules for generating elements of some type. One can then define some predicate on that type by providing constructors for forming the elements of the predicate , such inductively on the way the elements of the type are generated. Induction-induction generalizes this situation since one can ''simultaneously'' define the type and the predicate, because '''the rules for generating elements of the type''' &lt;math&gt;A : \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt; '''are allowed to refer to the predicate''' &lt;math&gt;B : A \to \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt;.

Induction-induction can be used to define larger types including various universe constructions in type theory.&lt;ref name=Dybjer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dybjer|first=Peter|title=A general formulation of simultaneous inductive-recursive definitions in type theory|journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=65|issue=2|date=June 2000|pages=525–549|url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/Inductive_Recursive.pdf|doi=10.2307/2586554|jstor=2586554|citeseerx=10.1.1.6.4575}}&lt;/ref&gt; and limit constructions in category/topos theory&lt;ref name=1337777.OOO&gt;1337777.OOO : ''limit objects depend on morphisms , BUT THIS DEPENDENCE NEED-NOT BE GRAMMATICAL !'' , https://github.com/1337777/cartier/blob/master/cartierSolution3.v&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example 1 ==

Present the type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as having the following constructors , note the early reference to the predicate &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; :

* &lt;math&gt;aa : A&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ell\ell : \prod_{x : A} B(x) \to A ; &lt;/math&gt;

and-simultaneously present the predicate &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as having the following constructors :

* &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Tru} : B(aa)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Fal} : B(aa)&lt;/math&gt;
* if &lt;math&gt;x : A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y : B(x)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Zer} : B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;
* if &lt;math&gt;x : A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y : B(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z : B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Suc}(z) : B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;.

As you can see, we gave rules for generating the elements of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which amount to saying that &lt;math&gt;B(aa)&lt;/math&gt; is (isomorphic to) the booleans, and &lt;math&gt;B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt; is (isomorphic to) the natural numbers.

== Example 2 ==

A simple common example is the Universe à la  Tarski type former.  It creates some inductive type &lt;math&gt;U : \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt; and some inductive predicate &lt;math&gt;T : U \to \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt;. For every type in the type theory (except &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; itself!), there will be some element of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; which may be seen as some code for this corresponding type ; The predicate &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; inductively encodes each possible type to the corresponding element of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; ; and constructing new codes in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; will require referring to the decoding-as-type of earlier codes , via the predicate &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; .

==Work==

Aranda's complex body of work exists outside the boundaries of the object, and is characterized by the struggle of catching sight of elusive concepts such as time, circulation, and imagination. Her installations and temporary projects, which often examine social interactions and the role that the circulation of objects plays in the cycles of production and consumption, are intensely site-specific.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Much of her work takes up the concept of time, sometimes to consider alternative notions of the temporal experience, and other times to approach the arbitrariness of time and freedom from time.

===You had no ninth of May===
In ''You had no ninth of May!'' (2006), Aranda addresses the artificiality of the homogeneous construction of time through the case of [[Kirbati]], an archipelago in the Pacific that, in 1995, changed the position of the International Date Line (IDL). Through a series of installation pieces that conceptually and formally map the international date line at Kiribati, the artist investigates officially assigned time and calls into question concepts such as "today" or "tomorrow".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=49fbf1d8-1cc3-49f1-b868-3b262957a307%40sessionmgr114&amp;hid=105&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=84445864&amp;db=asu|title = The future was ceaselessly|last = Zaya|first = Octavio|date =1 December 2012|journal = Arte al Dia|doi = |pmid = |access-date =13 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===There has been a miscalculation ===
Aranda's 2007 work ''There has been a miscalculation (Flattened Ammunition)'' is an experiment on the functioning of time. This work consists in a transparent Plexiglas cube containing approximately 100 science-fiction novels with a story line taking place before 2007 (the year in which the work was first produced), which have been shredded, almost pulverized. It also contains a hidden computerized air compressor that unexpectedly and violently blows the dust around at random intervals, recalling a sudden sandstorm. This way, Aranda's work makes books endlessly circulate and swirl in an empty cube, leaving them incessantly suspended in a past future.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Intervals===
For ''Intervals'' (2009), a solo presentation of four works installed in the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], Aranda explored and inverted the notion of time as a strictly assigned linear designation marked by clocks and calendars. In this exhibition, all the works were proposed to partially describe, in the artist's words "a sense of time's passage according to subjective experience, rather than subscribed to a strict system of measurement that assigns a fixed duration to any given event".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each piece captures time's passage in an individualized sense, addressing what the artist conceives as "subject formation" and the assertion of one's dominion over one's own time as a condition for individualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==E-Flux==
Julieta Aranda has been actively collaborating on [[e-flux]] since 2003, which is a publishing platform, archive, artist project, curatorial platform, and cultural enterprise founded by [[Anton Vidokle]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/about/|title = e-flux: about|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aranda is both a contributor and editor of e-flux journal, and in collaboration with Vidokle, has produced several e-flux art projects that explore unusual models for the circulation and distribution of art.

===E-flux video rental ===
Conceived in 2004 in collaboration with Anton Vidokle, e-flux video rental (EVR) comprises a free VHS video rental store, a public screening room and an archive. Its collection is selected in collaboration with a large group of international curators, and consists of over 500 art films and video works that are available to the public for home viewing free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/e-flux-video-rental-3/|title = e-flux: announcements: e-flux video rental|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was originally presented in a storefront in New York, and has been presented at various locations around the world, with the inventory of videos continuously increasing. After seven years as a traveling project, EVR was donated to the [[Museum of Modern Art (Ljubljana)|Moderna Galerija]] in Ljubljana in 2011 for its permanent display, which is a reconstruction of the original storefront at 53 Ludlow Street, New York. As a video rental store entering a museum collection, EVR will preserve and make available for future study not only the videos that comprise it, but also the social form of video rental stores, and the technology that originally made it possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/e-flux-video-rental-found-a-home/|title = e-flux: announcements: e-flux video rental found a home|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pawnshop===
Released in 2007, ''Pawnshop'' is an e-flux project by artists [[Liz Linden]], Julieta Aranda, and Anton Vidokle. Both an exhibition and an artwork in itself, this project was originally located in e-flux's 53 Ludlow Street storefront, which temporarily became a pawnshop dedicated to the pawning of artworks. Its initial inventory consisted of over 60 pawned works from a group of artists invited to participate in the project, and after it was opened for business, further artists were able walk in with a work they wanted to pawn. After the initial 30 days, the artworks that have not been retrieved by their original owners became available for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/pawnshop/|title = e-flux: announcements: pawnshop|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time/bank===
An online platform initiated by Aranda and Vidokle, ''Time/Bank'' is based on the premise that everyone in the field of culture has something to contribute and that it is possible to develop and sustain an alternative economy by connecting existing needs with unacknowledged resources. On a practical level, it is a platform where artists, curators, writers and other people in the field, can exchange time and skills—help each other get things done without using money. Idealistically, ''Time/Bank'' can become a place where certain types of actions and ideas, that seem to have no value in our market-driven society, can gain a sense of worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.artandeducation.net/announcement/timebank/|title = art and education|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = artandeducation.net|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/timebank/|title = e-flux: timebank|date = |accessdate=1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = |author1=Aranda, Julieta  |author2=Vidokle, Anton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercommunity===
[[SUPERCOMMUNITY]] is an editorial project by e-flux journal commissioned for the 56th [[Venice Biennale]], which was run from May to August 2015. Julieta Aranda, Anton Vidokle, and [[Brian Kuan Wood]] have been co-editors of this project, which addresses e-flux journal and its readership as the supercommunity and presents a daily piece of writing that often adopts the form of poetry, short fiction or screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/e-flux-journal-at-the-56th-venice-biennale/|title = e-flux: announcements: e-flux journal at the 56th venice biennale|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has featured contributions from nearly one hundred authors such as anthropologists, artists, philosophers, poets, theorists and writers.

==Awards and recognition==
Aranda has been awarded numerous grants and merit scholarships, from institutions such as [[FONCA]], the National Foundation for the Culture and the Arts in Mexico (1995–1996), and both the School of Visual Arts (1995–1999), the [[National Board of Review]] (1996–1999) and Columbia University (2004) in New York.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She has also been an artist in residence at UNIDEE, the International Program by Fondazione Pistoletto in [[Biella]], Italy (2006), as well as at IAPSIS, the International Artists Studio Program in Stockholm (2006) and at the International Residence of Recollets in Paris (2008).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her work has been shown in internationally renowned institutions such as the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami]] (2009); the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York (2009); the [[National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design]], Oslo (2010); and [[Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León]], Spain (2010), as well as at international art festivals such as the [[Liverpool Biennial]] (2010); the Kassel [[Documenta]], Germany (2012); and the [[Shanghai Biennale]] (2012).

The work took place in a giant canvas cube at Laboratoire d'Art.

A '''list of metaphors in the English language''' organised by type. A [[metaphor]] is a literary [[figure of speech]] that uses an image, story or [[tangibility|tangible]] thing to represent a less tangible thing or some intangible quality or idea; e.g., "Her eyes were glistening jewels".  ''Metaphor'' may also be used for any [[rhetoric]]al [[Literal and figurative language|figures of speech]] that achieve their effects via association, comparison or resemblance.  In this broader sense, [[antithesis]], [[hyperbole]], [[metonymy]] and [[simile]] would all be considered types of metaphor. [[Aristotle]] used both this sense and the regular, current sense above.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992 pp.653"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'' (1992) pp.653–55: "A rhetorical figure with two senses, both originating with Aristotle in the 4c BC: (I) All figures of speech that achieve their effects through association, comparison and resemblance. Figures like antithesis, hyperbole, metonymy and simile are [in that sense] all species of metaphor. [But] this sense is not current, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
With metaphor, unlike [[analogy]], specific interpretations are not given explicitly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8969">A '''magnetorquer''' or '''magnetic torquer''' (also known as '''torque rod''') is a [[satellite]] system for [[attitude control]], detumbling, and stabilization built from [[electromagnetic coil]]s. The magnetorquer creates a magnetic dipole that interfaces with an ambient magnetic field, usually [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's]], so that the counter-forces produced provide useful [[torque]].

== Functional principle ==

Magnetorquers are essentially sets of electromagnets which are laid out to yield a rotationally asymmetric ([[anisotropic]]) magnetic field over an extended area. That field is controlled by switching [[Electric current|current]] flow through the coils on or off, usually under computerized [[feedback]] [[control theory|control]]. The magnets themselves are mechanically anchored to the craft, so that any magnetic force they exert on the surrounding magnetic field will lead to a magnetic reverse force and result in mechanical torque about the vessel's [[center of gravity]]. This makes it possible to freely pivot the craft around in a known local [[gradient]] of the magnetic field by only using electrical energy.
The magnetic dipole generated by the ''magnetorquer'' is expressed by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}=  n I \mathbf{A} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the number of turns of the wire, ''I'' is the current provided, and '''A''' is the [[vector area]] of the coil. 
The dipole interacts with the magnetic field generating a torque whose expression is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau}= \mathbf{m}\times \mathbf{B}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where '''m''' is the magnetic dipole vector, '''B''' the magnetic field vector (for a spacecraft it is the Earth magnetic field vector) and '''τ''' is the generated torque vector.

== Construction ==

The construction of a ''magnetorquer'' is based on the realization of a coil with a defined area and number of turns according to the required performances. However, there are different ways to obtain the coil, thus according to the construction strategy it is possible to find three type of magnetorquer, apparently very different from each other but based on the same concept &lt;ref&gt;{{cite document

}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
*'''Air-core magnetorquer''': this comprises the basic concept of ''magnetorquer'', a conductive wire wrapped around a non-conductive support anchored to the satellite. This kind of ''magnetorquer'' can provide a consistent magnetic dipole with an acceptable mass and encumbrance. 
*'''Embedded coil''': this kind of ''magnetorquer'' is constructed creating a spiral trace inside the [[Printed circuit board|PCBs]] of solar panels which generates the effect of the coil. This solution is the one with the least impact on the satellite as it is entirely contained within the solar panels. However, due to the physical limit in the board thickness and the presence of other circuits and electronic components, it is not possible to reach a high value of the magnetic dipole.  
*'''Torquerod''': this kind of ''magnetorquer'' is the most efficient solution. A conductive wire is wrapped around a ferromagnetic core which is magnetized when excited by the coil, thus generating a dipole considerably higher than the other solutions. However, the disadvantage is the presence of a residual magnetic dipole that remains even when the coil is turned off because of the [[Magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]] in the magnetization curve of the core. It is therefore necessary to demagnetize the core with a proper demagnetizing procedure. Normally, the presence of the core (generally consisting of heavy metal) increases the mass of the system.

Typically three coils are used, although reduced configurations of two or even one magnet can suffice where full attitude control is not needed or external forces like asymmetric [[Drag (physics)|drag]] allow [[Underactuation|underactuated control]]. The three coil assembly usually takes the form of three perpendicular coils, because this setup equalizes the rotational symmetry of the fields which can be generated; no matter how the external field and the craft are placed with respect to each other, approximately the same torque can always be generated simply by using different amounts of current on the three different coils.

As long as [[Electric current|current]] is passing through the coils and the spacecraft has not yet been stabilized in a fixed orientation with respect to the external field, the craft's spinning will continue.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Very small satellites may use [[permanent magnet]]s instead of coils.

== Advantages ==

Magnetorquers are lightweight, reliable, and energy-efficient. Unlike [[Rocket engine|thrusters]], they do not require expendable [[propellant]] either, so they could in theory work indefinitely as long as sufficient [[Electric power|power]] is available to match the [[resistive]] load of the coils. In Earth orbit, sunlight is one such practically inexhaustible energy source, using [[solar panels]].

A further advantage over [[momentum wheel]]s and [[control moment gyroscope]]s is the absence of [[moving parts]] and therefore significantly higher reliability.

== Disadvantages ==

The main disadvantage of magnetorquers is that very high [[magnetic flux density|magnetic flux densities]] are needed if large craft have to be turned very fast. This either necessitates a very high [[amperage|current]] in the coils, or much higher ambient flux densities than are available in [[Earth orbit]]. Subsequently, the torques provided are very limited and only serve to accelerate or decelerate the change in a spacecraft's attitude by minute amounts. Over time active control can produce very fast spinning even here, but for accurate attitude control and stabilization the torques provided often aren't enough.

A broader disadvantage is the dependence on Earth's magnetic field strength, making this approach unsuitable for deep space missions, and also more suitable for [[low Earth orbit]]s as opposed to higher ones like the [[geosynchronous]]. The dependence on the highly variable intensity of Earth's magnetic field is also problematic because then the attitude control problem becomes highly [[nonlinear]]. It is also impossible to control attitude in all three axes even if the full three coils are used, because the torque can be generated only perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field vector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Any spinning satellite made of a conductive material will lose rotational momentum in Earth's magnetic field due to generation of [[eddy current]]s in its body and the corresponding braking force proportional to its spin rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aerodynamics|Aerodynamic]] [[friction]] losses can also play a part. This means that the magnetorquer will have to be continuously operated, and at a power level which is enough to counter the resistive forces present. This is not always possible within the energy constraints of the vessel.

The Michigan Exploration Laboratory (MXL) suspects that the [[M-Cubed]] [[CubeSat]], a joint project run by MXL and [[JPL]], became magnetically conjoined to [[Explorer-1 Prime]], a second CubeSat released at the same time, via strong onboard magnets used for passive attitude control, after deploying on October 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The '''McIntyre System''', or systems as there have been five of them, is a [[playoff]] system that gives an advantage to teams or competitors qualifying higher. The systems were developed by [[Kenneth McIntyre|Ken McIntyre]], an Australian lawyer, historian and English lecturer, for the [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]] in 1931.

The first McIntyre System, the [[#Page–McIntyre system|Page–McIntyre system]], also known as the McIntyre Final Four System, was adopted by the VFL in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/182547662/20683097 Finals System Successful: Originator Explains the Reasons, ''The Sporting Globe'', Saturday, 10 October 1931, p.2].&lt;/ref&gt; after using three systems since its foundation in 1897, the major system and predecessor to the Page–McIntyre system being the "[[Second amended Argus system|amended ''Argus'' system]]" that had operated from 1907 to 1923 and 1925 to 1930.

McIntyre also devised the McIntyre Final Five System for the VFL for 1972, the McIntyre Final Six System for 1991 (which was revised for 1992) and the [[McIntyre Final Eight System]] for the 1994 season.

The AFL and its fans grew dissatisfied with some of the outcomes the McIntyre Final Eight system might allow, and replaced it with [[AFL final eight system|another final eight system]] in 2000.

== Other competitions ==
McIntyre finals systems are used prominently throughout Australia. Most Australian rules football leagues, from professional down to suburban, use a McIntyre finals system. The [[National Rugby League|New South Wales Rugby League/National Rugby League]] has used the McIntyre Final Four and Final Five at different times throughout its history, and used the McIntyre Final Eight System from 1999 until 2011. The Page–McIntyre system is also used in the [[ANZ Championships]] (netball), the [[Australian Baseball League]] and [[Women's National Basketball League]]. It was also used in the [[A-League]] (soccer) before that competition expanded its finals series to a top-six format. It is also used in the [[Indian Premier League]] (cricket).

Under the name [[Page playoff system]], the McIntyre Final Four is commonly used in [[softball]] and [[curling]] events, especially in Canada. The system was also used in the [[Rugby League National Leagues|Rugby League National League Three]] in Great Britain for the 2004 season.

Many leagues which later adopted the Page–McIntyre system use the terms "Major Semi-Final" and "Minor Semi-Final" to more descriptively differentiate between the two games.&lt;/ref&gt;||Rank 3||v||Rank 4

The Page–McIntyre system feature four teams. In the first round of the Page–McIntyre system, the highest two ranked teams play each other, with the winner going straight through to the grand final and the loser going through to the preliminary final. The lowest two ranked teams play each other, and the winner advances to the preliminary final. The winner of preliminary final gets through to the grand final. In this system, the top two teams are able to lose a match and still qualify for the Grand Final, this is referred to as a 'double chance'.

Assuming that each team has an even chance of winning each match, the probability for both the highest ranked teams winning the competition is 37.5%, compared to 12.5% for the third and fourth placed teams.

=== McIntyre final five system ===

As its name states, the McIntyre final five system features five teams. From the second round the McIntyre final five system is the same as the Page–McIntyre system, however, in the first round the lowest two ranked teams play to eliminate one team and the second and third ranked teams determine which match they will play in the second round. The highest ranked team has a bye in the first round.

In this case, if all teams have an even chance of winning each match, the highest ranked team has a 37.5% chance, ranks two and three have a 25% chance and the lowest two ranked teams have a 6.25% chance of winning the competition.

=== First McIntyre final six system ===

The first McIntyre final six system was also the same as the Page–McIntyre system from the second round. In this case, two of the four lowest ranked teams are eliminated in the first round, while the top two determine which match they will play in the second round. Under this system the top two teams receive a double chance, as does the winner of match B.

=== Second McIntyre final six system ===
{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center"

|}
This adaptation of the first McIntyre System corrected for the anomaly that, in the first week, the team who finished 4th would have a more difficult opponent than the team who finished 5th, and was hence more likely to be eliminated, despite finishing higher. This was achieved by adding flexibility to the second round draw, so that the two elimination final winners were re-ranked to determine which played the winner of the qualifying final and which played the loser.

However, both McIntyre final six systems had another weakness: the loser of the Qualifying Final (which is the most difficult game of the first round), ended up facing elimination in the First-Semi Final, while the higher-ranked Elimination Final winner (who has had the easiest game of the first round) has a double chance in the Second-Semi Final.

=== McIntyre final eight system ===

|}

The McIntyre final eight bears little in common with the other McIntyre Systems. At no stage does it follow the Page–McIntyre structure, and at no stage after the first week does any team retain a double chance. The system allows for 26 of the 28 combinations of the eight finalists to feature in the Grand Final (the two combinations not possible are 1st v 7th and 2nd v 8th). It gives 18.75% to 1st and 2nd, 15.625% to 3rd, 12.5% to 4th and 5th, 9.375% to 6th and 6.25% to 7th and 8th.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2620">A '''Morton's fork''' is a type of [[false dilemma]] in which contradictory observations lead to the same conclusion. It is said to have originated with the collecting of taxes by [[John Morton (bishop)|John Morton]].

The earliest known use of the term dates from the mid-19th century and the only known earlier mention is a claim by [[Francis Bacon]] of an extant tradition.&lt;ref name="ODPF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O214-MortonsFork.html |title=Morton's Fork |work=Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dilemma==
Under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] John Morton was made archbishop of Canterbury in 1486, then Lord Chancellor in 1487. He raised taxation funds for his king by holding that someone living modestly must be saving money and, therefore, could afford taxes, whereas someone living extravagantly obviously was rich and, therefore, could afford taxes.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Morton's-Fork | title=Morton's Fork | publisher=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODPF"/&gt;

In some instances, such as Morton's original use of the fallacy, it may be that one of the two observations is probably valid, but the other is pure [[Sophism | sophistry]]: evidence of possessing wealth may be genuinely irrelevant to having a source of taxable income.

In other cases, it may be that neither observation may be relied upon to support the conclusion properly. For example, asserting that a person suspected of a crime who is acting nervously must have something to feel guilty about, while a person who acts calmly and confidently must be practised or skilled at hiding guilt. Either observation therefore has little, if any, [[relevance (law)|probative]] value, as each could equally be evidence for the opposite conclusion.

==Examples==
"[[Morton's fork coup]]" is a maneuver in the game of [[Contract bridge|bridge]] that uses the principle of Morton's Fork.&lt;ref&gt;Frey et al. (1976). ''The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge'', p. 295. {{ISBN|0-517-52724-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Robert. [[The Bridge World]], March 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode of the television series ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'' is entitled "[[Morton's Fork (Fargo)|Morton's Fork]]", after the dilemma. It is also mentioned in NCIS Los Angeles season 5 episode 16, "Fish Out of Water."

{{for|the historic branch of metaphysics|Natural philosophy}}
'''''Naturphilosophie''''' (German for "'''nature-philosophy'''"&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;) is a term used in English-language philosophy to identify a current in the [[philosophy|philosophical]] tradition of [[German idealism]], as applied to the study of [[nature]] in the earlier 19th century. German speakers use the clearer term ''Romantische Naturphilosophie'', the [[philosophy of nature]] developed at the time of the founding of [[German Romanticism]]. It is particularly associated with the philosophical work of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]]&lt;ref name=Beiser&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]](2002), ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism 1781-1801'', Harvard university Press, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt;—though it has some clear precursors also. More particularly it is identified with some of the initial works of Schelling during the period 1797–9, in reaction to the views of Fichte, and subsequent developments from Schelling's position. Always controversial, some of Schelling's ideas in this direction are still considered of philosophical interest, even if the subsequent development of experimental [[natural science]] had a destructive impact on the credibility of the theories of his followers in ''Naturphilosophie''.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schelling/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Naturphilosophie'' attempted to comprehend nature in its totality and to outline its general theoretical structure, thus attempting to lay the foundations for the natural sciences. In developing their theories, the German ''Naturphilosophen'' found their inspiration in the [[natural philosophy]] of the Ancient Greek [[Ionian philosophers]].

As an approach to philosophy and science, ''Naturphilosophie'' has had a difficult reception. In Germany, [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantians]] came to distrust its developments as speculative and overly metaphysical.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cohen/&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was poorly understood in [[Anglophone]] countries. Over the years, it has been subjected to continuing criticism. Since the 1960s, improved translations have appeared, and scholars have developed a better appreciation of the objectives of ''Naturphilosophie''.

==Outline of development==

The German Idealist philosopher Fichte had attempted to show that the whole structure of reality follows necessarily from the fact of [[self-consciousness]]. Schelling took Fichte's position as his starting-point, and in his earliest writings posited that nature must have reality for itself. In this light Fichte's doctrines appeared incomplete. On the one hand, they identified the ultimate ground of the universe of reason too closely with finite, individual Spirit. On the other, they threatened the reality of the world of nature by seeing it too much in the manner of [[subjective idealism]]. Fichte, in this view, had not managed to unite his system with the [[aesthetic]] view of nature to which [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' had pointed.

''Naturphilosophie'' is therefore one possible theory of the unity of nature. Nature as the sum of what is objective, and intelligence as the complex of all the activities making up self-consciousness, appear as equally real. The philosophy of nature and [[transcendental idealism]] would be the two complementary portions making up philosophy as a whole.

==German philosophy==

''Naturphilosophie'' translated into English would mean just "philosophy of nature", and its scope began to be taken in a broad way. [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], particularly taken in opposition to [[Immanuel Kant]], was a precursor of Schelling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Herder's dynamic view of nature was developed by Goethe and Schelling and led to the tradition of ''Naturphilosophie''[...]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/160/269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] theorised about a particular German strand in philosophy of nature, citing [[Jakob Böhme]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Georg Ernst Stahl]], with [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] as an edge case.&lt;ref&gt;Paola Mayer, ''Jena Romanticism and Its Appropriation of Jakob Böhme: Theosophy, Hagiography, Literature'' (1999), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Beiser]] instead traces ''Naturphilosophie'' as developed by Schelling, Hegel, Schlegel and [[Novalis]] to a crux in the theory of matter, and identifies the origins of the line they took with the ''[[vis viva]]'' theory of matter in the work of [[Gottfried Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Beiser, 'The Enlightenment and Idealism', pp. 21–42, esp. pp. 32–33, in [[Karl Ameriks]] (editor) (2000), ''The Cambridge Companion to German Idealism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently Schelling identified himself with [[Baruch Spinoza|Baruch de Spinoza]], to whose thought he saw himself as approaching. The ''Darstellung meines Systems'', and the expanded treatment in the lectures on a ''System der gesamten&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; Philosophie und der Naturphilosophie insbesondere'' given in [[Würzburg]] in 1804, contain elements of Spinoza's philosophy.

==Schelling&lt;!--'Transcendental realism (Schelling)' and 'Transcendental naturalism (Schelling)' redirect here--&gt;==
{{also|History of metaphysical realism}}
In a short space of time Schelling produced three works: ''Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur als Einleitung in das Studium dieser Wissenschaft'', 1797 (''Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature as Introduction to the Study of this Science''); ''Von der Weltseele'', 1798 (''On the World Soul''); and ''Erster Entwurf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie'', 1799 (First Plan of a System of the Philosophy of Nature).  As criticism of scientific procedure, these writings retain a relevance. Historically, according to Richards:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the tentativeness of their titles, these monographs introduced radical interpretations of nature that would reverberate through the sciences, and particularly the biology, of the next century. They developed the fundamental doctrines of ''Naturphilosophie''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''System des transzendentalen Idealismus'', 1800 (''System of Transcendental Idealism'') Schelling included ideas on matter and the organic in Part III. They form just part of a more ambitious work that takes up other themes, in particular aesthetics. From this point onwards ''Naturphilosophie'' was less of a research concern for him, as he reformulated his philosophy. However, it remained an influential aspect of his teaching. For a short while, he edited a journal, the ''Neue Zeitschrift für speculative Physik'' (bound volume 1802).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/diglib/aufkl/nzsspekulativephys/index.htm Online text]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'' was a way in which he worked himself out of the tutelage of Fichte, with whom he quarrelled decisively towards the end of the 1790s. More than that, however, it brought him within the orbit of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], both intellectually and (as a direct consequence of Goethe's sympathetic attitude) by a relocation; and it broke with basic [[Kantian]] tenets. Grant writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Schelling's postkantian confrontation with nature itself begins with the overthrow of the [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican revolution]] ...&lt;ref&gt;Grant p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schelling held that the divisions imposed on nature, by our ordinary perception and thought, do not have absolute validity. They should be interpreted as the outcome of the single formative energy which is the soul or inner aspect of nature. In other words he was a proponent of a variety of [[organicism]]. The dynamic series of stages in nature, the forms in which the ideal structure of nature is realized, are matter, as the equilibrium of the fundamental expansive and contractive forces; light, with its subordinate processes (magnetism, electricity, and chemical action); organism, with its component phases of reproduction, irritability and sensibility. The continual change presented to us by experience, taken together with the thought of unity in productive force of nature, leads to the conception of the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] through which nature expresses itself in its varied products.

In the introduction to the ''Ideen'' he argues against [[dogmatism]], in the terms that a dogmatist cannot explain the organic; and that recourse to the idea of a cosmic creator is a feature of dogmatic systems imposed by the need to explain nature as purposive and unified.&lt;ref&gt;Dale E. Snow, ''Schelling and the end of Idealism'' (1996), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Fichte's system, called the ''Wissenschaftslehre'', had begun with a fundamental distinction between dogmatism (fatalistic) and criticism (free), as his formulation of idealism.&lt;ref&gt;Beiser 2002, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beiser divides up the mature form of Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'' into the attitudes of '''transcendental realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the thesis that "nature exists independent of all consciousness, even that of the transcendental subject") and '''transcendental naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the thesis that "everything is explicable according to the laws of nature, including the rationality of the transcendental subject").&lt;ref&gt;Beiser 2002, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes how ''Naturphilosophie'' was first a counterbalance to ''Wissenschaftslehre'', and then in Schelling's approach became the senior partner. After that, it was hardly to be avoided that Schelling would become an opponent of Fichte, having been a close follower in the early 1790s.

We are able to apprehend and represent nature to ourselves in the successive forms which its development assumes, since it is the same spirit of which we become aware in self-consciousness, though here unconsciously. The variety of its forms is not imposed on it externally, since there is no external [[teleology]] in nature. Nature is a self-forming whole, within which only natural explanations can be sought. The function of ''Naturphilosophie'' is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real, not to deduce the real from the ideal.

==Influence and critics of ''Naturphilosophie''==

Criticism of ''Naturphilosophie'' has been widespread, over two centuries. Schelling's theories, however influential in terms of the general culture of the time, have not survived in scientific terms. Like other strands of speculation in the [[life sciences]], in particular, such as [[vitalism]], they retreated in the face of experiment, and then were written out of the history of science as [[Whig history]]. But critics were initially not scientists (a term not used until later); rather they came largely from within philosophy and [[Romanticism in science|Romantic science]], a community including many physicians. Typically, the retrospective views of scientists of the 19th century on "Romantic science" in general erased distinctions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scientific criticism in the nineteenth century took hardly any notice of the distinctions between Romantic, speculative and transcendental, scientific and aesthetic directions.&lt;ref name=DvE&gt;Dietrich von Engelhardt, ''Romanticism in Germany'' p. 112, in [[Roy Porter]] and [[Mikulaš Teich]], editors, ''Romanticism in National Context'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One outspoken critic was the chemist [[Justus von Liebig]], who compared ''Naturphilosophie'' with the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegbert Prawer]] (editor), ''The Romantic Period in Germany'' (1970), Introduction by Prawer p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic, the physiologist [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], frequently dismissed ''Naturphilosophie'' as "bogus."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reden|last=du Bois-Reymond|first=Emil|publisher=Veit|year=1912|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=vol. 2: 143, 258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in aesthetics===

[[Isaiah Berlin]] summed up the reasons why ''Naturphilosophie'' had a wide-ranging impact on views of art and artists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;if everything in nature is living, and if we ourselves are simply its most self-conscious representatives, the function of the artist is to delve within himself, and above all to delve within the dark and unconscious forces which move within him, and to bring these to consciousness by the most agonising and violent internal struggle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaiah Berlin]], ''The Roots of Romanticism'' (Henry Hardy, editor) (2000), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Philosophical criticism===

Fichte was very critical of the opposition set up in Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'' to his own conception of ''Wissenschaftslehre''. In that debate, Hegel then intervened, largely supporting his student friend Schelling, with the work usually called his ''Differenzschrift'', the ''Differenz des Fichteschen und Schellingschen Systems der Philosophie'' (The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's System of Philosophy); a key publication in his own philosophical development, his first book, it was published in September 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Pinkard, ''Hegel'' (2000), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schelling's Absolute was left with no other function than that of removing all the differences which give form to thought. The criticisms of Fichte, and more particularly of Hegel (in the Preface to the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''), pointed to a defect in the conception of the Absolute as mere featureless identity. It was ridiculed by Hegel as "the night in which all cows are black."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Phenomenology of Spirit|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=xOnhG9tidGsC&amp;dq=The+Phenomenology+of+Spirit,+trans.+A.+V.+Miller&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|date = 1998-01-01|isbn = 9788120814738|language = en|first = Georg Wilhelm Friedrich|last = Hegel|first2 = A.

===Other views in Romantic science===

[[Ignaz Paul Vitalis Troxler]], a follower of Schelling, later broke with him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fernuni-hagen.de/EUROL/Projekt/biografien/troxler-e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He came to the view that the Absolute in nature and mind is beyond the intellect and reason.&lt;ref name=DvE/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5114">'''Nelson rules''' are a method in [[process control]] of determining if some measured variable is out of control (unpredictable versus consistent). Rules,  for detecting "out-of-control" or non-random conditions were first postulated by [[Walter A. Shewhart]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc32.htm Engineering Statistics Handbook 6.3.2], NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], Dec 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1920s.  The Nelson rules were first published in the October 1984 issue of the ''[[Journal of Quality Technology]]'' in an article by [[Lloyd S Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd S. Nelson, "The Shewhart Control Chart—Tests for Special Causes". Journal of Quality Technology 16, no. 4 (October 1984), 238-239. https://doi.org/10.1080/00224065.1984.11978921&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules are applied to a [[control chart]] on which the magnitude of some [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] is plotted against time. The rules are based on the [[mean]] value and the [[standard deviation]] of the samples.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
! Rule|| Description|| Chart Example|| Problem Indicated
|-
|width="75pt"| &lt;center&gt;Rule 1&lt;/center&gt;||width="250pt"| One point is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean.|| [[File:Rule 1 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px|]]||width="250pt"| One sample (two shown in this case) is grossly out of control.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 2&lt;/center&gt; || Nine (or more) points in a row are on the same side of the mean. || [[File:Rule 2 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| Some prolonged [[systematic bias|bias]] exists.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 3&lt;/center&gt; || Six (or more) points in a row are continually increasing (or decreasing). ||[[File:Rule 3 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| A [[trend estimation|trend]] exists.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 4&lt;/center&gt; || Fourteen (or more) points in a row alternate in direction, increasing then decreasing. ||[[File:Rule 4 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px|]]|| This much [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]] is beyond [[Signal noise|noise]].

Note that the rule is concerned with directionality only. The position of the mean and the size of the standard deviation have no bearing.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 5&lt;/center&gt; || Two (or three) out of three points in a row are more than 2 standard deviations from the mean in the same direction.  ||[[File:Rule 5 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| There is a medium tendency for samples to be mediumly out of control.

The side of the mean for the third point is unspecified.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 6&lt;/center&gt; || Four (or five) out of five points in a row are more than 1 standard deviation from the mean in the same direction. ||[[File:Rule 6 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| There is a strong tendency for samples to be slightly out of control.

The side of the mean for the fifth point is unspecified.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 7&lt;/center&gt; || Fifteen points in a row are all within 1 standard deviation of the mean on either side of the mean. ||[[File:Rule 7 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| With 1 standard deviation, greater variation would be expected.

|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 8&lt;/center&gt; || Eight points in a row exist, but none within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and the points are in both directions from the mean.  ||[[File:Rule 8 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px |]]|| Jumping from above to below whilst missing the first standard deviation band is rarely random.
|}

The above eight rules apply to a chart of a variable value.

A second chart, the moving [[Range (statistics)|range]] chart, can also be used but only with rules 1, 2, 3 and 4. Such a chart plots a graph of the maximum value - minimum value of '''N''' adjacent points against the time sample of the range.

An example moving range: if N = 3 and values are 1, 3, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4, 5 then the sets of adjacent points are (1,3,5) (3,5,3) (5,3,3) (3,3,2) (3,2,4) (2,4,5) resulting in moving range values of (5-1) (5-3) (5-3) (3-2) (4-2) (5-2) = 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3.

Applying these rules indicates when a potential "out of control" situation has arisen. However, there will always be some false alerts and the more rules applied the more will occur. For some processes, it may be beneficial to omit one or more rules. Equally there may be some missing alerts where some specific "out of control" situation is not detected. Empirically, the detection [[accuracy]] is good.

The '''nursing process''' is a modified [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;Funnell, R., Koutoukidis, G.&amp; Lawrence, K. (2009)Tabbner's Nursing Care (5th Edition), p. 72, Elsevier Pub, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ackley, B. J., &amp; Ladwig, G. B. (2017). Nursing diagnosis handbook: An evidence-based guide to planning care (10 ed.). St. Louis: Mosby/Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing practise was first described as a four-stage nursing process by Ida Jean Orlando in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Marriner-Tomey &amp; Allgood (2006) Nursing Theorists and their work. p. 432&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with [[nursing theory|nursing theories]] or [[health informatics]]. The diagnosis phase was added later.

The nursing process uses clinical judgement to strike a balance of [[epistemology]] between personal interpretation and research evidence in which  [[critical thinking]] may play a part to categorize the clients issue and course of action. Nursing offers diverse patterns of knowing.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, P. (2009) Inspired knowing in nursing. p. 63 in Loscin &amp; Purnell (Eds) (2009) Contemporary Nursing Process.Springer Pub&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing knowledge has embraced pluralism since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, H (2010) The Nature of Theoretical Thinking in Nursing. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors refer to a [[mind map]] or [[Abductive|abductive reasoning]] as a potential alternative strategy for organizing care.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, J &amp; Lowenstein (2010) Innovative Teaching Strategies in Nursing and Related Health Professions.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] plays a part for experienced nurses.&lt;ref&gt;Funnell, R., Koutoukidis, G.&amp; Lawrence, K. (2009) Tabbner's Nursing Care (5th Edition), p. 222, Elsevier Pub, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phases==
[[File:Nursing process (NANDA).svg|thumb|400px|Diagram of the five-phase nursing process]]
The nursing process is goal-oriented method of caring that provides a framework to [[nursing care]]. It involves seven major steps:

*A
: [[Nursing assessment|Assess]] (what data is collected?)
*D
: [[Nursing diagnosis|Diagnose]] (what is the problem?)
*O
:  Outcome Identification - (Was originally a part of the Planning phase, but has recently been added as a new step in the complete process).
*P
: [[Nursing care plan|Plan]] (how to manage the problem)
*I
: Implement (putting plan into action)
*R
:Rationale (Scientific reason of the implementations)
*E
: Evaluate (did the plan work?)

According to some theorists, this seven-steps description of the nursing process is outdated and misrepresents nursing as linear and atomic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogeriannursingscience.wikispaces.com/Chapter+7+Practice+Methods|title=RogerianNursingScience - Chapter 7 Practice Methods|author=|date=|website=rogeriannursingscience.wikispaces.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessing phase===
{{Main article|Nursing assessment}}
The nurse completes an [[holistic]] [[nursing assessment]] of the needs of the individual/family/community, regardless of the reason for the encounter. The nurse collects [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[data]] and [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] [[data]] using a nursing framework, such as Marjory  [[Gordon's functional health patterns]].

====Models for data collection====
Nursing assessments provide the starting point for determining nursing diagnoses. It is vital that a recognized nursing assessment framework is used in practice to identify the patient's* problems, risks and outcomes for enhancing health. The use of an evidence-based nursing framework such as Gordon's Functional Health Pattern Assessment should guide assessments that support nurses in determination of NANDA-I nursing diagnoses. For accurate determination of nursing diagnoses, a useful, evidence-based assessment framework is best practice.

=====Methods=====
*Client Interview
*Physical Examination
*Obtaining a health history (including dietary data)
*Family history/report
*

===Diagnosing phase===
{{Main article|Nursing diagnosis}}
[[Nursing diagnosis|Nursing diagnoses]] represent the nurse's clinical judgment about actual or potential health problems/life process occurring with the individual, family, group or community. The accuracy of the nursing diagnosis is validated when a nurse is able to clearly identify and link to the defining characteristics, related factors and/or risk factors found within the patients assessment. Multiple nursing diagnoses may be made for one client.

===Planning phase===
{{Main article|Nursing care plan}}
In agreement with the client, the nurse addresses each of the problems identified in the diagnosing phase. When there are multiple nursing diagnoses to be addressed, the nurse prioritizes which diagnoses will receive the most attention first according to their severity and potential for causing more serious harm. For each problem a measurable goal/outcome is set. For each goal/outcome, the nurse selects nursing interventions that will help achieve the goal/outcome. A common method of formulating the expected outcomes is to use the [[evidence-based]] [[Nursing Outcomes Classification]] to allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and outcome measures.  The interventions used in the [[Nursing Interventions Classification]] again allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and ability to identify nursing activities, which can also be linked to nursing workload and staffing indices. The result of this phase is a [[nursing care plan]].

===Implementing phase===
The nurse implements the [[nursing care plan]], performing the determined interventions that were selected to help meet the goals/outcomes that were established. Delegated tasks and the monitoring of them is included here as well.

'''Activities'''
* pre-assessment of the client-done before just carrying out implementation to determine if it is relevant
* determine need for assistance
* implementation of nursing orders
* delegating and supervising-determines who to carry out what action

===Evaluating phase===
The nurse evaluates the progress toward the goals/outcomes identified in the previous phases. If progress towards the goal is slow, or if regression has occurred, the nurse must change the plan of care accordingly. Conversely, if the goal has been achieved then the care can cease. New problems may be identified at this stage, and thus the process will start all over again.

==Characteristics==
The nursing process is a '''cyclical''' and '''ongoing''' process that can end at any stage if the problem is solved. The nursing process exists for every problem that the individual/family/community has. The nursing process not only focuses on ways to improve physical needs, but also on social and emotional needs as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20577">'''Occupational segregation''' is the distribution of [[worker]]s across and within [[Job|occupation]]s, based upon [[demographic]] characteristics, most often [[gender]].{{sfn|Bergmann|1981}}  Occupational segregation levels differ on a basis of perfect segregation and integration.  Perfect segregation occurs where any given occupation employs only one group.  Perfect integration, on the other hand, occurs where each group holds the same proportion of positions in an occupation as it holds in the labor force.{{sfn|Weeden|2007}}

Many scholars, such as Biblarz et al., argue that occupational segregation is most likely caused by [[sexism|gender-based discrimination]]{{sfn|Biblarz|Bengtson|Bucur|1996}} that often occurs in patterns, either horizontally (across occupations) or vertically (within the hierarchy of occupations). Both of these contribute to the [[gender pay gap]].{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

==Types==

===Horizontal===
Horizontal segregation refers to differences in the number of people of each gender present across occupations.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Horizontal segregation is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy ([[post-industrial society]]), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the [[care work]] of their children and their homes,{{sfn|Charles|2003}} they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation is in our society.

===Vertical===
The term ''vertical segregation'' describes men's domination of the highest status jobs in both traditionally male and traditionally female occupations.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Colloquially, the existence of vertical segregation is referred to as allowing men to ride in a "glass escalator" through which women must watch as men surpass them on the way to the top positions.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Karrie Ann and Adam Isaiah Green. 2008. "'Revisiting the Glass Escalator: The Case of Gender Segregation in a Female Dominated Occupation." Social Problems 55(2): 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the more occupational segregation present in a country, the less vertical segregation there is because women have a better chance of obtaining the highest positions in a given occupation as their share of employment in that particular occupation increases.{{sfn|Watts|2005}}

Vertical segregation can be somewhat difficult to measure across occupations because it refers to hierarchies within individual occupations. For example, the category of Education Professionals, (a category in the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations, Second Edition), is broken down into "School Teachers," "University and Vocational Education Teachers," and "Miscellaneous Education Professionals." These categories are then further broken down into subcategories. While these categories aptly describe the divisions within education, they are not comparable to the hierarchical categories within other occupations, and thus make comparisons of levels of vertical segregation quite difficult.{{sfn|Watts|2005}}

==Maintenance mechanisms==

===Self-selection===
Some women self-select out of higher status positions, choosing instead to have more time to spend at home and with their families. According to Sarah Damaske, this choice is often made because high status positions do not allow time for the heavy domestic workload that many women expect to take on due to the gendered division of labor in the home.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Working class women, in particular, also sometimes self-select out of more time-intensive or higher -status positions in order to maintain the traditional gender hierarchy and household accord.{{sfn|Damaske|2004}}

===Educational disparities===
Human capital explanations are those that argue that an individual's and a group's occupational and economic success can be at least partially attributed to accumulated abilities developed through formal and informal education and experiences.{{sfn|Mincer|1891}} Human capital explanations for occupational segregation, then, posit that a difference in educational levels of men and women is responsible for persistent occupational segregation. Contrary to this theory, however, over past 40 years, women's educational attainment has outpaced men's. One area of education that might play a substantial role in occupational segregation, however, is the dearth of women in science and mathematics.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} STEM fields tend to be pipelines to higher paying jobs. Therefore, the lack of women in higher paying jobs might be partially because they do not pursue science and mathematics in school. This can be seen in areas such as finance, which is very mathematics heavy and is also a very popular field for those who eventually rise to high status positions in the private sector. This choice, like others, is often a personal preference or made because of the cultural idea that women are not as good as men at mathematics.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}}

===Work experience disparities===
Human capital explanations also posit that men tend to rise to higher positions than women because of a disparity in work experience between the genders. Indeed, the gap between men and women's tenure rises with age, and female college graduates are more likely than males to interrupt their careers to raise children.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} Such choices may also be attributed to the gendered division of labor which holds women primarily responsible for domestic duties.

===Preferences===
Human capital explanations posit additionally that men are more likely than women to preference their work life over their family life. However, the General Social Survey found that men were only slightly less likely than women to value short hours, and that preferences for particular job characteristics depended mostly on age, education, race, and other characteristics rather than on gender.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} In addition, other research has shown that men and women likely hold endogenous job preferences, meaning that their preferences are due to the jobs they hold and those they have held in the past rather than related inherently to gender. After taking into consideration men and women's jobs, there is no difference in their job preferences. Men and women engaged in similar types of work have similar levels of commitment to work and display other similar preferences.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}}

===Job search strategies===
According to sociologists Hanson and Pratt, men and women employ different strategies in their job searches that play a role in occupational segregation. These differing strategies are influenced by power relations in the household, the gendered nature of social life, and women's domestic responsibilities. The last factor, in particular, leads women to prioritize the geographical proximity of paid employment when searching for a job. In addition, most people have been found to find their jobs through informal contacts. The gendered nature of social life leads women to have networks with smaller geographical reach than men. Thus, the location of women in female-dominated occupations which are lower-status and lower pay is the result of "severe day-to-day time constraints" rather than a conscious and long-term choice made that would be able to maximize pay and prestige.{{sfn|Hanson|Pratt|1991}}

== Gender ==

===Gender pay gap===
{{Main|Gender pay gap}}
Women in female-dominated jobs pay two penalties: the average wage of their jobs is lower than that in comparable male-dominated jobs, and they earn less relative to men in the same jobs.  In addition, women's wages are negatively affected by the percentage of females in a job, but men's wages are essentially unaffected.{{sfn|Cohen|Bianchi|1999}}
The crowding hypothesis postulates that occupational segregation lowers all women's earnings as a result of women's exclusion from primarily male occupations and segregation into a number of predominantly female-dominated occupations.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}} Given that feminine skills are traditionally rewarded less both in salary and prestige, the crowding of women into certain occupations makes these occupations valued less in both pay and prestige.

Crowding is found to be alleviated through macro-changes in occupational segregation. Teaching, for example, at least in recent generations, is traditionally a female- dominated profession. However, when positions open up for women in business and other high-earning occupations, school boards must raise the salaries of potential teachers to attract candidates. This is an example of how even women in traditionally female-dominated professions still benefit salary-wise from the gendered integration of the market.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

=== Gendered division of labor ===
{{Main|Sexual division of labour}}
The gendered division of labor helps to explain the hierarchy of power across gender identity, class, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=Mary Beth|date=|title=Gender and Inequality in the Global Labor Force|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=32|pages=41-62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist feminists]] contribute to this ideology through a Marxist frame of [[alienated labor]] and the [[means of production]]. [[Heidi Hartmann]] emphasized the gendered division of labor as patriarchal control over women's labor. Wally Saccombe suggested the mode of production should become a unity of production and reproduction, in which women's reproductive abilities are viewed as a valuable source of labor or income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burris|first=Val|date=|title=The Dialectic of Women's Oppression: Notes of the Relation Between Capitalism and Patriarchy|url=|journal=Berkeley Journal of Sociology|volume=27|pages=51-74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The "wages for housework" movement in the late 1970s showcased the importance of gender inequality in the workplace. Socialist feminists critiqued the exploitation of women's household and reproductive labor, since it was not viewed as a commodity that deserved payment in the market economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergeron|first=Suzanne|date=|title=Formal, Informal, and Care Economies|url=|journal=Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Women often experience working a "double day" or "second shift" when they go to a wage-earning job and then come home to take care of children and the home&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminisms Matter|last=Bromley|first=Victoria|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Measurement==
Occupational segregation is measured using [[Duncan Segregation Index|Duncan's D]] (or the [[index of dissimilarity]]), which serves as a measure of dissimilarity between two distributions.  D has to be calculated first:

# Identify N different occupations.
# Calculate the percentage of men (or other ascribed category) who work in each of the occupations and the percentage of women who work in each occupation.  Give men and women a variable name (m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; could = men, w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; could = women).
# Duncan's D is calculated using this formula: {{math|D{{=}}½ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}}} {{clarify|date=April 2012}}{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
#*It is important to note that Duncan's D uses percentages.  So in a given occupation, the number of men (or women) in that occupation should be divided by the total number of men (or women) in all of the occupations.  For example:  You may have 10 men who are nurses out of 600 total men.  The value for the occupation of male nurses should be 10/600, or .0166.

Over the last century in the United States, there has been a surprising stability of segregation-index scores, which measure the level of occupational segregation of the labor market.{{sfn|Charles|2003}}  There were declines in occupational segregation in the 1970s and 1980s, as technologies that made the care work of the home quicker and easier allowed more women time to enter the workforce.{{sfn|Cohen|2004}} However, occupational segregation remains a fixed element of the United States workforce today.
As recently as 1996, it has been found that gender occupational segregation over the past three generations has not decreased. In one study, grown women working in the 1980s were likely to have faced the same occupational segregation faced by their mothers working in the 1960s and their grandmothers working in the 1940s.{{sfn|Biblarz|Bengtson|Bucur|1996}}

==Solutions==
Gender egalitarian cultural principles, or changes in traditional gender norms, are one possible solution to occupational segregation in that they reduce discrimination, affect women's self-evaluations, and support structural changes. Horizontal segregation, however, is more resistant to change from simply modern egalitarian pressures.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Changes in norms may reinforce the impact of occupational integration in that once people see women in traditionally male-dominated occupations, their expectations about women in the labor market might be changed.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

Some scholars, such as Haveman and Beresford, therefore argue that any policies aimed at reducing occupational inequality must focus on culture changes.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} According to Haveman and Beresford, people in the United States have historically tended to reject policies that only support one group (unless that group is them). Therefore, effective policies for limiting occupational segregation must aim to provide benefits across groups. Therefore, policies that aim at capping work hours for salaried workers or mandate on-site employer sponsored childcare might be most effective.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}}

In addition, the more occupational integration that occurs, the more women are in the positions to make powerful decisions affecting occupational segregation. If the overall market becomes less segregated, those who make personnel decisions in traditionally female-dominated occupations will have to make jobs, even higher status jobs, more attractive to women to retain them.  School boards, for example, will have to appoint more women to department head positions and other positions of authority in order to retain women workers, whereas those jobs might previously have gone to men.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

==On the basis of sexual orientation==
In addition to gender, sexual orientation can also be a significant basis for occupational segregation: there is a  disproportionately high number of gay and lesbian workers in certain occupations. Research shows that gay men are more likely to be in female-majority occupations than are heterosexual men, and lesbians are more represented in male-majority occupations than are heterosexual women, but even after accounting for this tendency, common to both gay men and lesbians is a propensity to concentrate in occupations that provide task independence or require social perceptiveness, or both.{{sfn|Tilcsik|Anteby|Knight|2015}}

A '''play-in game'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22542306/zach-lowe-real-possibility-nba-playoffs-play-tournament (Feb 22, 2018) Retrieved Oct 10, 2018, from http://www.espn.com&lt;/ref&gt;'' is a game at the beginning of a tournament that forces the lowest qualifiers for the tournament to play each other before the main portion of the tournament begins. This gives an added advantage to the higher qualifiers, allowing them to rest, while the lower teams extend themselves by playing. Further, teams that participate in the play-in must usually play the next game against the highest qualifier in the tournament and play on the road. Having a play-in game allows for a tournament to have a number of teams that is not a [[power of two]], and gives an extra advantage for teams to play for, as they try to win to avoid having to play in the extra game.

      <comment>/* Constants of motion */ Poisson theorem may not work for time dependent constants of motion.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18856">In [[mathematics]] and [[classical mechanics]], the '''Poisson bracket''' is an important [[binary operation]] in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], playing a central role in Hamilton's equations of motion, which govern the time evolution of a Hamiltonian [[dynamical system]]. The Poisson bracket also distinguishes a certain class of coordinate transformations, called ''[[canonical transformations]]'', which map [[Canonical coordinates|canonical coordinate systems]] into canonical coordinate systems. A "canonical coordinate system" consists of canonical position and momentum variables (below symbolized by &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;, respectively) that satisfy canonical Poisson bracket relations. The set of possible canonical transformations is always very rich. For instance, it is often possible to choose the Hamiltonian itself &lt;math&gt;H =H(q, p; t)&lt;/math&gt; as one of the new canonical momentum coordinates.

In a more general sense, the Poisson bracket is used to define a [[Poisson algebra]], of which the algebra of functions on a [[Poisson manifold]] is a special case. There are other general examples, as well: it occurs in the theory of [[Lie algebra]]s, where the [[tensor algebra]] of a Lie algebra forms a Poisson algebra; a detailed construction of how this comes about is given in the [[universal enveloping algebra]] article. Quantum deformations of the universal enveloping algebra lead to the notion of [[quantum group]]s.

All of these objects are named in honour of [[Siméon Denis Poisson]].

==Properties==
Given two functions &lt;math&gt;f,\ g&lt;/math&gt; that depend on [[phase space]] and time, their Poisson bracket &lt;math&gt;\{f, g\}&lt;/math&gt; is another function that depends on phase space and time. The following rules hold for any three functions &lt;math&gt;f,\, g,\, h&lt;/math&gt; of phase space and time:
;[[Anticommutativity]]: &lt;math&gt;\{f, g\} = -\{g, f\}&lt;/math&gt;
;[[Bilinearity]]: &lt;math&gt;\{af + bg, h\} = a\{f, h\} + b\{g, h\}, \quad \{h, af + bg\} = a\{h, f\} + b\{h, g\}, \quad a, b \in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;
;[[Product rule|Leibniz's rule]]: &lt;math&gt;\{fg, h\} = \{f, h\}g + f\{g, h\}&lt;/math&gt;
;[[Jacobi identity]]: &lt;math&gt;\{f, \{g, h\}\} + \{g, \{h, f\}\} +  \{h, \{f, g\}\} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Also, if a function &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is constant over phase space (but may depend on time), then &lt;math&gt;\{f,\, k\} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition in canonical coordinates==
In [[canonical coordinates]] (also known as [[Darboux coordinates]]) &lt;math&gt; (q_i,\, p_i)&lt;/math&gt; on the [[phase space]], given two functions &lt;math&gt; f(p_i,\, q_i, t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g(p_i,\, q_i, t)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&lt;math&gt; f(p_i,\, q_i,\, t)&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the &lt;math&gt;2N + 1&lt;/math&gt; independent variables: momentum, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;{{sub|1…N}}; position, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;{{sub|1…N}}; and time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Poisson bracket takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;\{f, g\} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial q_{i}} \frac{\partial g}{\partial p_{i}} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i} \frac{\partial g}{\partial q_i}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The Poisson brackets of the canonical coordinates are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \{q_i,q_j\} &amp;= 0 \\
  \{p_i,p_j\} &amp;= 0 \\
  \{q_i,p_j\} &amp;= \delta_{ij}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;''{{sub|ij}} is the [[Kronecker delta]].

==Hamilton's equations of motion==
[[Hamilton's equations of motion]] have an equivalent expression in terms of the Poisson bracket. This may be most directly demonstrated in an explicit coordinate frame. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f(p, q, t)&lt;/math&gt; is a function on the manifold. Then from the multivariable [[chain rule]],

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} f(p, q, t) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial q} \frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac {\partial f}{\partial p} \frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further, one may take &lt;math&gt;p=p(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q=q(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be solutions to [[Hamilton's equations]]; that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
  \dot{q} =  \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} = \{q, H\} \\ 
  \dot{p} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q} = \{p, H\}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Then 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac {\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} f(p, q, t) &amp;= \frac{\partial f}{\partial q} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial p} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \\
                                             &amp;= \{f, H\} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} ~.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the time evolution of a function {{mvar|f}} on a [[symplectic manifold]] can be given as a [[flow (mathematics)|one-parameter family]] of [[symplectomorphism]]s (i.e., [[canonical transformations]], area-preserving diffeomorphisms), with the time ''t'' being the parameter:  Hamiltonian motion is a canonical transformation generated by the Hamiltonian. That is, Poisson brackets are preserved in it, so that ''any time t'' in the solution to Hamilton's equations, 

: &lt;math&gt; q(t) = \exp (-t \{ H, \cdot \} ) q(0), \quad  p(t) = \exp (-t \{ H, \cdot \}) p(0) &lt;/math&gt;, 

can serve as the bracket coordinates. ''Poisson brackets are [[Canonical transformation|canonical invariants]]''.

Dropping the coordinates, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t} f = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} - \{H, \cdot\}\right)f~.&lt;/math&gt;

The operator in the convective part of the derivative, {{mvar|i}}''L&amp;#770;'' = {{math|−{''H'', •} }}, is sometimes referred to  as the Liouvillian (see [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)]]).

==Constants of motion==
An [[integrable dynamical system]] will have [[constants of motion]] in addition to the energy. Such constants of motion will commute with the Hamiltonian under the Poisson bracket. Suppose some function &lt;math&gt;f(p, q)&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of motion. This implies that if &lt;math&gt;p(t), q(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[trajectory]] or solution to  the [[Hamilton's equations of motion]], then

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{\text{d}f}{\text{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

along that trajectory. Then

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t} f(p,q) = \{f, H\} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}=\{f, H\}&lt;/math&gt;

where, as above, the intermediate step follows by applying the equations of motion and we supposed that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; does not explicitly depend on time. This equation is known as the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)#Liouville equations|Liouville equation]]. The content of [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] is that the time evolution of a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] (or "[[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]]" on the phase space) is given by the above.

If the Poisson bracket of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; vanishes (&lt;math&gt;\{f,g\} = 0&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''in involution'''.  In order for a Hamiltonian system to be [[completely integrable]], &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; independent constants of motion must be in [[Distribution (differential geometry)#Involutive distributions|mutual involution]], where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of degrees of freedom.

Furthermore, according to the '''Poisson's Theorem''', if two quantities &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are explicitly time independent (&lt;math&gt;A(p, q), B(p, q)&lt;/math&gt;) constants of motion, so is their Poisson bracket &lt;math&gt;\{A,\, B\}&lt;/math&gt;. This does not always supply a useful result, however, since the number of possible constants of motion is limited (&lt;math&gt;2n - 1&lt;/math&gt; for a system with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom), and so the result may be trivial (a constant, or a function of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.)

==The Poisson bracket in coordinate-free language==
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be   [[symplectic manifold]], that is, a [[manifold]] equipped with a [[symplectic form]]: a [[Differential form|2-form]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; which is both '''closed''' (i.e., its  [[exterior derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\text{d} \omega&lt;/math&gt; vanishes) and '''non-degenerate'''.  For example, in the treatment above, take &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; and take

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{d} q_i \wedge \text{d} p_i.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \iota_v \omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[interior product]] or [[Tensor contraction|contraction]] operation defined by &lt;math&gt; (\iota_v \omega)(w) =  \omega(v,\, w)&lt;/math&gt;, then non-degeneracy is equivalent to saying that for every one-form &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique vector field &lt;math&gt;\Omega_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \iota_{\Omega_\alpha} \omega =  \alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_{\text{d} H} = \omega^{-1}(\text{d} H)&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth function on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Hamiltonian vector field]] &lt;math&gt;X_H&lt;/math&gt; can be defined to be &lt;math&gt; \Omega_{\text{d} H}&lt;/math&gt;.  It is easy to see that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  X_{p_i} &amp;=  \frac{\partial}{\partial q_i} \\
  X_{q_i} &amp;= -\frac{\partial}{\partial p_i}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Poisson bracket''' &lt;math&gt;\ \{\cdot,\, \cdot\} &lt;/math&gt; on (''M'', ω) is a [[bilinear map|bilinear operation]] on [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, defined by &lt;math&gt; \{f,\, g\} \;=\; \omega(X_f,\, X_g) &lt;/math&gt;; the Poisson bracket of two functions on ''M'' is itself a function on ''M''.  The Poisson bracket is antisymmetric because:

:&lt;math&gt;\{f, g\} = \omega(X_f, X_g) = -\omega(X_g, X_f) = -\{g, f\} &lt;/math&gt;.

Furthermore,

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \{f, g\} &amp;= \omega(X_f, X_g) = \omega(\Omega_{df}, X_g) \\
           &amp;= (\iota_{\Omega_{df}}\omega)(X_g) = df(X_g) \\
           &amp;= X_gf = \mathcal{L}_{X_g} f
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Here ''X&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;f'' denotes the vector field ''X&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' applied to the function ''f'' as a directional derivative, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{X_g} f&lt;/math&gt; denotes the (entirely equivalent) [[Lie derivative]] of the function ''f''.

If α is an arbitrary one-form on ''M'', the vector field Ω&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; generates (at least locally) a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] &lt;math&gt; \phi_x(t)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the boundary condition &lt;math&gt; \phi_x(0) = x&lt;/math&gt; and the first-order differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi_x}{dt} = \left. \Omega_\alpha \right|_{\phi_x(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt; \phi_x(t)&lt;/math&gt; will be [[symplectomorphism]]s ([[canonical transformation]]s) for every ''t'' as a function of ''x'' if and only if &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_{\Omega_\alpha}\omega \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt;; when this is true, Ω&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is called a [[symplectic vector field]].  Recalling [[Cartan's identity]] &lt;math&gt;  \mathcal{L}_X\omega \;=\; d (\iota_X \omega) \,+\, \iota_X d\omega&lt;/math&gt; and ''d''ω = 0, it follows that &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_{\Omega_\alpha}\omega \;=\; d\left(\iota_{\Omega_\alpha} \omega\right) \;=\; d\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, Ω&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is a symplectic vector field if and only if α is a [[Closed and exact differential forms|closed form]].  Since &lt;math&gt; d(df) \;=\; d^2f \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that every Hamiltonian vector field ''X&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a symplectic vector field, and that the Hamiltonian flow consists of canonical transformations.  From {{EquationNote|1|(1)}} above, under the Hamiltonian flow ''X&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'',

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}f(\phi_x(t)) = X_Hf = \{f,H\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a fundamental result in Hamiltonian mechanics, governing the time evolution of functions defined on phase space.  As noted above, when ''{f,H} = 0'', ''f'' is a constant of motion of the system.  In addition, in canonical coordinates (with &lt;math&gt; \{p_i,\, p_j\} \;=\; \{q_i,q_j\} \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{q_i,\, p_j\} \;=\; \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;), Hamilton's equations for the time evolution of the system follow immediately from this formula.

It also follows from {{EquationNote|1|(1)}} that the Poisson bracket is a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]]; that is, it satisfies a non-commutative version of Leibniz's [[product rule]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\{fg,h\} = f\{g,h\} + g\{f,h\}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\{f,gh\} = g\{f,h\} + h\{f,g\}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The Poisson bracket is intimately connected to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] of the Hamiltonian vector fields.  Because the Lie derivative is a derivation,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L_v\iota_w\omega = \iota_{\mathcal L_vw}\omega + \iota_w\mathcal L_v\omega = \iota_{[v,w]}\omega + \iota_w\mathcal L_v\omega&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus if ''v'' and ''w'' are symplectic, using &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_v\omega \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt;, Cartan's identity, and the fact that &lt;math&gt;\iota_w\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a closed form,

:&lt;math&gt;\iota_{[v,w]}\omega = \mathcal L_v\iota_w\omega = d(\iota_v\iota_w\omega) + \iota_vd(\iota_w\omega) = d(\iota_v\iota_w\omega) = d(\omega(w,v)).&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that &lt;math&gt;[v,w] = X_{\omega(w,v)}&lt;/math&gt;, so that
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;[X_f,X_g] = X_{\omega(X_g,X_f)} = -X_{\omega(X_f,X_g)} = -X_{\{f,g\}}&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Thus, the Poisson bracket on functions corresponds to the Lie bracket of the associated Hamiltonian vector fields.  We have also shown that the Lie bracket of two symplectic vector fields is a Hamiltonian vector field and hence is also symplectic.  In the language of [[abstract algebra]], the symplectic vector fields form a [[subalgebra]] of the [[Lie algebra]] of smooth vector fields on ''M'', and the Hamiltonian vector fields form an [[algebraic ideal|ideal]] of this subalgebra.  The symplectic vector fields are the Lie algebra of the (infinite-dimensional) [[Lie group]] of [[symplectomorphism]]s of ''M''.

It is widely asserted that the [[Jacobi identity]] for the Poisson bracket,

:&lt;math&gt;\ \{f,\{g,h\}\} + \{g,\{h,f\}\} + \{h,\{f,g\}\} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

follows from the corresponding identity for the Lie bracket of vector fields, but this is true only up to a locally constant function.  However, to prove the Jacobi identity for the Poisson bracket, it is [[Jacobi identity#Examples|sufficient]] to show that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}_{\{f,g\}}=[\operatorname{ad}_f,\operatorname{ad}_g]&lt;/math&gt;

where the operator &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}_g&lt;/math&gt; on smooth functions on ''M'' is defined by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}_g(\cdot) \;=\; \{\cdot,\, g\}&lt;/math&gt; and the bracket on the right-hand side is the commutator of operators, &lt;math&gt; [\operatorname A,\, \operatorname B] \;=\; \operatorname A\operatorname B - \operatorname B\operatorname A&lt;/math&gt;.  By {{EquationNote|1|(1)}}, the operator &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}_g&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the operator ''X&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''.  The proof of the Jacobi identity follows from {{EquationNote|3|(3)}} because the Lie bracket of vector fields is just their commutator as differential operators.

The [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] of smooth functions on M, together with the Poisson bracket forms a [[Poisson algebra]], because it is a [[Lie algebra]] under the Poisson bracket, which additionally satisfies Leibniz's rule {{EquationNote|2|(2)}}.  We have shown that every [[symplectic manifold]] is a [[Poisson manifold]], that is a manifold with a "curly-bracket" operator on smooth functions such that the smooth functions form a Poisson algebra.  However, not every Poisson manifold arises in this way, because Poisson manifolds allow for degeneracy which cannot arise in the symplectic case.

==A result on conjugate momenta==
Given a smooth [[vector field]] ''X'' on the configuration space, let ''P&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' be its [[conjugate momentum]]. The conjugate momentum mapping is a [[Lie algebra]] anti-homomorphism from the Poisson bracket to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\{P_X, P_Y\} = -P_{[X, Y]}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This important result is worth a short proof. Write a vector field ''X'' at point ''q'' in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] as

:&lt;math&gt;X_q = \sum_i X^i(q) \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}&lt;/math&gt; is the local coordinate frame. The conjugate momentum to ''X'' has the expression

:&lt;math&gt;P_X(q, p) = \sum_i X^i(q) \;p_i&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the momentum functions conjugate to the coordinates. One then has, for a point ''(q,p)'' in the [[phase space]],

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \{P_X,P_Y\}(q,p) &amp;=  \sum_i \sum_j \left\{ X^i(q) \;p_i, Y^j(q)\; p_j \right\} \\
                   &amp;=  \sum_{ij} p_i Y^j(q) \frac{\partial X^i}{\partial q^j} -  p_j X^i(q) \frac{\partial Y^j}{\partial q^i} \\
                   &amp;= -\sum_i p_i \; [X, Y]^i(q) \\
                   &amp;= - P_{[X, Y]}(q, p). 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The above holds for all ''(q, p)'', giving the desired result.

==Quantization==
Poisson brackets [[Deformation theory|deform]] to [[Moyal bracket]]s upon [[Weyl quantization|quantization]], that is, they generalize to a different Lie algebra, the [[Moyal bracket|Moyal algebra]], or, equivalently in [[Hilbert space]], quantum [[commutator]]s. The Wigner-İnönü [[group contraction]] of these (the classical limit, {{math|ħ → 0}})  yields the above Lie algebra.

To state this more explicitly and precisely, the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of the [[Heisenberg algebra]] is the [[Weyl algebra]] (modulo the relation that the center be the unit). The Moyal product is then a special case of the star product on the algebra of symbols. An explicit definition of the algebra of symbols, and the star product is given in the article on the [[universal enveloping algebra]].

A '''project network''' is a [[information graphics|graph]] (weighted [[directed graph]]) depicting the sequence in which a project's [[Work breakdown structure#Terminal element|terminal elements]] are to be completed by showing terminal elements and their [[dependency (project management)|dependencies]]. It is always drawn from left to right to reflect project chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Project Network Diagram | url=http://www.projectauditors.com/Dictionary2/1.8/index.php/term/,62555d9cae535f6f685560ac5b5d.xhtml | publisher=projectauditors.com | accessdate= April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:project network.png]]

The [[work breakdown structure]] or the [[product breakdown structure]] show the "part-whole" relations. In contrast, the project network shows the "before-after" relations.

The most popular form of project network is [[activity on node]] (AON)(as shown above), the other one is [[activity on arrow]] (AOA).

The condition for a valid project network is that it doesn't contain any [[circular reference]]s.

Project dependencies can also be depicted by a [[predecessor table]]. Although such a form is very inconvenient for human analysis, [[project management software]] often offers such a view for data entry.

An alternative way of showing and analyzing the sequence of project work is the [[Dependency Structure Matrix|design structure matrix]].

[[Image:Ruskin Cannery.jpg|thumb|right|Cannery operation in the Ruskin Cooperative, 1896]]
The '''Ruskin Colony''' (or '''Ruskin Commonwealth Association''') was a [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] colony which existed near [[Tennessee City, Tennessee|Tennessee City]] in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] from 1894 to 1896.  The colony moved to a slightly more permanent second settlement on an old farm five miles north from 1896 to 1899, and saw another brief incarnation near [[Waycross, Georgia|Waycross]], in southern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], from 1899 until it finally dissolved in 1901.  Its regional location within the [[Southern United States]] set it apart from many other similar utopian projects of the era.  At its high point, the population was around 250.  The colony was named after [[John Ruskin]], the English socialist writer. A cave on the colony's second property in Dickson County still carries his name. The site of the colony's second settlement in Dickson County is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The Ruskin Colony was founded by [[Julius Augustus Wayland]] (1854-1912), a newspaper editor and [[Socialism|socialist]] from [[Indiana]].  The roots of the Ruskin project can be found in the movement within American socialism at the time towards the creation of new model colonies which would, in theory, challenge the American industrial system by creating ethical alternatives built in rural settings.  The idea that new settlements such as Ruskin would eventually bring forth a revolution referred to as the "co-operative commonwealth" stood in contrast to socialists who believed that it was more important to do political and social organizing within the cities, the centers of industry.  According to W. Fitzhugh Brundage in the book ''A Socialist Utopia in the New South'': "The wastefulness and ugliness of competitive individualism, so glaringly apparent in late nineteenth-century cities, would be replaced by the efficient creation and collective control of wealth and technology" in this new settlement.

==Cooperative economics==
[[Image:Strawberry Pickers Ruskin Cooperative.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Strawberry Pickers Ruskin Cooperative, 1897]]
By requiring that all members of the colony become equal shareholders in the endeavor, Wayland constructed Ruskin so that it operated more as a legally-sanctioned [[corporation]].  Every colonist was then, in essence, a stockholder.  The colony, with its elected [[board of directors]], was to run much like any other company, except that it would "do all things necessary to make a success, financially and socially, of a co-operative colony."  (''The Coming Nation'', Feb. 3, 1894) Ruskin colonists manufactured and marketed pants, "cereal coffee," a vapor bath cabinet, chewing gum, belts and suspenders.  The system of work itself changed little from that of the world outside Ruskin in terms of hours devoted to the various industries, however the hours, schedules and rates of pay, and industries selected were all determined by the workers.  Ruskinites eventually abolished cash wages and adopted a system of [[scrip]] which was used in exchange for goods within the colony.  In securing their economic dependence, members of the settlement also gave ample time to creative crafts, theater, and other intellectual pursuits.  At one time late in the history of the colony, there even existed a band which toured southern Georgia.

Many of the products created in Ruskin were intended to supplement the income from the newspaper, ''The Coming Nation'', which was the primary source of financial stability.  The majority of the colony's money and time was put into the paper, which had at its peak in 1896 around 60,000 subscribers.  Besides being the chief flow of assets, the paper also gave voice to the men and women of the colony throughout its many editors.  Although Julius Wayland almost single-handedly founded the colony, he left in 1895 due to conflicts about ownership of the newspaper that ran counter to his claims of collective ownership.  Under Alfred S. Edwards, who succeeded Wayland, ''The Coming Nation'' included articles from the likes of [[George D. Herron]], [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], and Herbert Casson (who later took up the editorial reigns after Edwards left the colony).

The eventual breakup of the Ruskin colony was due to several elements, the most problematic being the unequal distribution of membership rights of colonists complicated by the "shareholder"-type initial investment fees.  Much of the blame lay with the original [[charter member]]s, who had become entrenched in leadership and direction of Ruskin.  One particular issue which drew ideological divisions through the colony was that of [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] relationships, or the practice of "[[free love]]", within members of the colony.  Ruskinites opposed to these beliefs brought harsh criticism down on those who harbored free love sympathies, which were in many ways linked to [[Anarchism|anarchist]] currents that had been growing within the colony.  This could be traced to Alfred Edward's editorial slant towards anarchism during his time as editor of ''The Coming Nation''.

== Georgia ==
The colony eventually became mired in constant [[litigation]] over issues of property, with charter members who were now being pushed out of Ruskin seeking to dismantle the group through legal means.  The final auction of the Ruskin Colony site at Cave Mills and most of the communal property left the remaining members with only a fraction of what they had spent five years struggling to build.  The 240 members moved what they did have, which still included the newspaper and the printing apparatus for it, 613 miles on a chartered train to their new home in Georgia, where they merged with the Duke Colony in [[Ware County, Georgia|Ware County]] and formed the Ruskin Commonwealth.

However, after its first year in Georgia, the number of colonists dropped by half.  The new settlement, an old lumber mill, was not surrounded by the fertile land and good sources of water that the previous location had.  Ruskinites were plagued with disease, unprofitable business ventures, and a continual slide into poverty that eventually led to the auction of the property by the county [[sheriff]] to settle its debts.  The Ruskin Commonwealth was effectively disbanded in the autumn of 1901.

The Ruskin Commongood Society platted [[Ruskin, Florida]] on February 19, 1910.

The picture is painted on in oils on canvas and has dimensions of 98 x 74,5&amp;nbsp;cm. It is one of the most important works of Bohumil Kubishta, member of the pre-First World War Czech avant-garde. Unlike traditional Christian interpretations of the theme of suffering of the Christian martyr, Bohumil Kubishta combines cubist forms and expressiveness, but integrates spiritual strength.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Surrogation''' is a [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomenon in which the measure(s) of a [[Construct (philosophy)|construct of interest]] evolve to replace the construct itself. Research on [[performance measurement]] in [[management accounting]] has identified surrogation as "the tendency for managers to lose sight of the [[Strategic management|strategic]] construct(s) the [performance] measures are intended to represent, and subsequently act as though the measures ''are'' the constructs of interest" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Willie|last2=Hecht|first2=Gary|last3=Tayler|first3=William B.|date=2012-07-04|title=Strategy Selection, Surrogation, and Strategic Performance Measurement Systems|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00465.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Accounting Research|language=EN|volume=51|issue=1|pages=105-133|doi=10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00465.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; An everyday example of surrogation is a manager tasked with increasing customer satisfaction who begins to believe that the customer satisfaction survey score actually ''is'' customer satisfaction.

==First usage==
Inspired by work by [[Yuji Ijiri]], the term ''surrogation'' was coined by Willie Choi, Gary Hecht, and William Tayler in their paper, "Lost in Translation: The Effects of Incentive Compensation on Strategy Surrogation".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Willie|last2=Hecht|first2=Gary|last3=Tayler|first3=William B.|date=2011-05-24|title=Lost in Translation: The Effects of Incentive Compensation on Strategy Surrogation|url=http://www.aaapubs.org/doi/10.2308/accr-10273?code=aaan-site|journal=The Accounting Review|language=EN|volume=87|issue=4|pages=1135-1163|doi=10.2308/accr-10273}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They show [[Management|managers]] tend to use measures as surrogates for [[Business strategy|strategy]], acting as if measures were in fact the strategy when making optimization decisions. This appears to occur even if a measure-maximizing choice ultimately works against the strategy.

They also show surrogation is exacerbated by [[Incentive program|incentive compensation]]. But, the phenomenon is distinct from [[wealth]]-maximizing behavior, since it persists both when incentives are removed and when they are changed to create an [[opportunity cost]] for maximizing the surrogate. The additional tendency to surrogate in the presence of incentives is reduced when managers are compensated based on multiple measures of a strategy rather than on a single measure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Choi et al. proposed [[attribute substitution]] as a mechanism for surrogation. Attribute substitution in [[decision-making]] involves a complex ''target attribute'' being replaced by a more easily accessible ''[[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|heuristic]] attribute''. For this to occur, the target attribute must be relatively inaccessible, the heuristic attribute must be readily accessible, and the mental substitution must not be consciously rejected by the person. In the case of surrogation, the two attributes are related in that some party intends the heuristic attribute to serve as proxy for the target attribute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Further studies==
In a follow-up study, Choi, Hecht, and Tayler demonstrate involving managers in the selection of a strategy reduces their tendency to surrogate. Merely involving managers in the strategy deliberation process does not appear to have the same surrogation-reducing effect as involving them in the actual selection of the strategy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Jeremiah Bentley shows the effects of incentive compensation on surrogation are partially [[Mediation (statistics)|explained]] by a mechanism in which measure-based incentive compensation (in this case using a single measure) and wealth-maximizing behavior lead [[Principal–agent problem|agents]] to [[Campbell's law|distort]] their operational decisions (see [[Campbell's law]]). That operational distortion, in turn, leads them to [[Belief revision|change their beliefs]] about the compensated measure's causal relationship with the outcome—in other words, to surrogate—possibly as a means of reducing [[cognitive dissonance]] arising from inconsistency between beliefs and actions. He demonstrates that allowing people to provide narrative explanations for their decisions reduces the amount of operational distortion observed under an incentive compensation scheme, and also reduces surrogation. He also finds that the effect is larger for people who have a high preference for consistency, which supports the argument that surrogation is due to an attempt to reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Jeremiah W.|date=2017-02-24|title=Decreasing Operational Distortion and Surrogation through Narrative Reporting|ssrn=2924726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Bloomfield had proposed a link between cognitive dissonance and surrogation in an earlier paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloomfield|first=Robert J.|date=2015-02-01|title=Rethinking Managerial Reporting|url=http://aaajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2308/jmar-51061|journal=Journal of Management Accounting Research|language=EN|volume=27|issue=1|pages=139–150|doi=10.2308/jmar-51061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent study, Paul Black, Tom Meservy, William Tayler, and Jeff Williams show that surrogation can occur simply when a measure is provided to managers, even if they do not receive incentive compensation based on the measure. That is, if managers know that something is being measured, they will begin to surrogate on that measure, ''even if they are told that the measure is no more nor less important that other measures when determining their compensation.'' This implies that firms must be careful in determining what measures are communicated to managers, as managers may surrogate on a measure just because they hear that it is being measured.

William Tayler discusses everyday examples of surrogation and incentive compensation on BYU News Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.byuradio.org/episode/8c31b2be176e4d5b9a02ed1b41b2d42d/the-morning-show-drones-incentives-and-taliban-poets|title=Episode - BYUradio|website=www.byuradio.org|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrogation is conceptually related to Plato's [[Allegory of the Cave]] in that people are failing to distinguish the shadow (i.e. the measure) from the form (i.e. the [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bloomfield|first=Robert J.|date=2014-04-22|title=What Counts and What Gets Counted|ssrn=2427106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrogation is also related to [[Simulacra and Simulation|Baudrillard's concept of simulacra]], in his order-of-simulacra theory. The connection to this concept is discussed in Macintosh, Shearer, Thornton and Welker (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macintosh|first=Norman B.|last2=Shearer|first2=Teri|last3=Thornton|first3=Daniel B.|last4=Welker|first4=Michael|date=2000|title=Accounting as Simulacrum and Hyperreality: Perspectives on Income and Capital|journal=Accounting, Organizations &amp; Society|volume=25|pages=13–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general the application of a systematic process is regarded as a means of management aimed at reducing the number and severity of mistakes, errors and failures due to either [[human error|human]] or [[mechanical failure|technological]] functions involved. 

Use of systematic process in [[strategic planning]] has been both challenged, due to rapid change in market conditions, and advocated as a source of improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Grünig, ''Process-based Strategic Planning'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2006, pp.45-46&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "Many OECD countries have a transparent and systematic process of public consultation to enhance the quality of the regulatory process by guaranteeing that the impact on citizens and businesses is taken into account."&lt;ref&gt;''China: defining the boundary between the market and the state'', OECD Reviews of Regulatory Reform, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2009, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The group, comprising critical gender, feminist, and queer scholars, formed to tackle "neurosexism"&lt;ref name="Schmitz_Höppner_Frontiers" /&gt; as defined by [[Cordelia Fine]] in her 2010 book ''[[Delusions of Gender]]'' "uncritical biases in [neuroscientific] research and public perception, and their societal impacts on an individual, structural, and symbolic level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fine | first = Cordelia | author-link = Cordelia Fine | title = Delusions of gender: how our minds, society, and neurosexism create difference | publisher = W.W.

By contrast they practice "neurofeminism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bluhm | first1 = Robyn | last2 = Maibom | first2 = Heidi Lene | last3 = Jaap Jacobson | first3 = Anne | author-link1 = Robyn Bluhm | title = Neurofeminism: issues at the intersection of feminist theory and cognitive science  | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780230296732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to critically evaluate [[heteronormative]] assumptions of contemporary brain research and examine the impact and cultural significance of neuroscientific research on society's views about gender.&lt;ref name="Schmitz_Höppner_Frontiers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Kaiser | first1 = Anelis | last2 = Dussauge | first2 = Isabelle | author-link1 = Anelis Kaiser | author-link2 = Isabelle Dussauge | contribution = Re-queering the brain | editor-last1 = Bluhm | editor-first1 = Robyn | editor-last2 = Jacobson | editor-first2 = Anne Jaap | editor-last3 = Maibom | editor-first3 = Heidi Lene | editor-link1 = Robyn Bluhm | title = Neurofeminism: issues at the intersection of feminist theory and cognitive science | pages = 121&amp;ndash;144 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Hampshire New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781349333929 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network advocate greater emphasis to be placed on [[neuroplasticity]] rather than biological determinism.&lt;ref name="Schmitz_Höppner_Frontiers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vidal | first1 = Catherine | title = The sexed brain: between science and ideology | journal = Neuroethics, Special Issue: Neuroscience and Sex/Gender | volume = 5 | issue =  3 | pages = 295&amp;ndash;303 | doi = 10.1007/s12152-011-9121-9 | date = December 2012 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex differences in human neonatal social perception ===
Non-network member, [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], conducted a test on newborns – on average a day-and-a-half old – to see if they were more interested a human face (social object) or a mobile (physical-mechanical object). Baron-Cohen concluded that the results, based on the eye-gaze of the babies, "showed that the male infants showed a stronger interest in the physical-mechanical mobile while the female infants showed a stronger interest in the face" and the "research clearly demonstrates that sex differences are in part biological in origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connellan | first1 = Jennifer | last2 = Baron-Cohen | first2 = Simon | last3 = Wheelwright | first3 = Sally | last4 = Batkia | first4 = Anna | last5 = Ahluwaliab | first5 = Jag | author-link2 = Simon Baron-Cohen | title = Sex differences in human neonatal social perception | journal = Infant Behavior and Development | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 113&amp;ndash;119 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-6383(00)00032-1 | date = January 2000 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.627.1904 }}

=== Gender differences when processing fear ===
In an [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] study into the gender differences when processing fear, Schienle ''et al.'' (who are not part of The NeuroGenderings Network) began with an hypothesis that women would show a greater emotional response than men. In fact, the results showed the opposite. The researchers' explanation for the unexpected response pattern was that it "may reflect greater attention from males to cues of aggression in their environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schienle | first1 = Anne | last2 = Schäfer | first2 = Axel | last3 = Stark | first3 = Rudolf | last4 = Walter | first4 = Bertram | last5 = Vaitl | first5 = Dieter | title = Gender differences in the processing of disgust- and fear-inducing pictures: an fMRI study | journal = [[NeuroReport]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 277&amp;ndash;280 | pmid = 15706235 | date = 28 February 2005 | url = http://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Abstract/2005/02280/Gender_differences_in_the_processing_of_disgust_.15.aspx | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Network member [[Robyn Bluhm]] criticized the initial hypothesis, that women would show a greater emotional response than men, as stereotyping. She also criticized the researchers' explanation for the unexpected results, as they discounted the possibility that men may be more sensitive to fear than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Turk | first = Victoria | title = You can't just reduce neurological differences to "women can't read maps" | work = [[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]] | url = https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gvywam/how-neurosexism-feeds-stereotypes-about-mens-and-womens-brains | date = 28 November 2014 | access-date = 25 August 2017}}

=== Female brain / male brain versus "mosaics" of brain features ===
An article by Tracey Shors found "sex differences in emotional and cognitive responses in rats" and she advised that her findings "be used to better understand and promote mental health in humans" as "a greater appreciation of our [sex] differences can only enhance our ability to treat our common afflictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shors | first = Tracey J. | title = Opposite effects of stressful experience on memory formation in males versus females | journal = Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience, Special Issuel: CNS Aspects of Reproductive Endocrinology | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 139&amp;ndash;147 | pmc = 3181678 | date = June 2002 | url = https://www.dialogues-cns.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/04/DialoguesClinNeurosci-4-139.pdf | ref = harv | pmid = 22033590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, the research carried out by network member [[Daphna Joel]] ''et al.'' found that "between 55% and 70% of people had a “mosaic” of gender characteristics, compared to less than one per cent who had only “masculine” or only “feminine” characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Joel | first1 = Daphna | last2 = Fine | first2 = Cordelia | author-link1 = Daphna Joel | author-link2 = Cordelia Fine | title = It's time to celebrate the fact that there are many ways to be male and female | work = [[The Guardian]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/01/brain-sex-many-ways-to-be-male-and-female | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 1 December 2015 | access-date = 26 August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8733">A '''Total Maximum Daily Load''' (TMDL) is a regulatory term in the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]], describing a plan for restoring impaired waters that identifies the maximum amount of a [[pollutant]] that a [[body of water]] can receive while still meeting [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|water quality standards]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act, sec. 303(d), {{USCSub|33|1313|d}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and federal agency responsibilities==
The Clean Water Act requires that state environmental agencies complete TMDLs for impaired waters and that the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) review and approve / disapprove those TMDLs.&lt;ref name="EPA overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/program-overview-impaired-waters-and-tmdls |title=Program Overview: Impaired Waters and TMDLs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-11-28 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because both state and federal governments are involved in completing TMDLs, the TMDL program is an example of [[cooperative federalism]]. If a state doesn't take action to develop TMDLs, or if EPA disapproves state-developed TMDLs, the EPA is responsible for issuing TMDLs. EPA published regulations in 1992 establishing TMDL procedures.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. "Water Quality Planning and Management: Total maximum daily loads (TMDL) and individual water quality-based effluent limitations." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|130|7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Application of TMDLs has broadened significantly in the last decade to include many watershed-scale efforts, including the [[Chesapeake Bay]] TMDL. TMDLs identify all [[point source pollution|point source]] and [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint source]] pollutants within a [[drainage basin|watershed]].

==State inventories==
The Clean Water Act requires states to compile lists of water bodies that do not fully support [[beneficial use]]s such as [[aquatic life]], [[fisheries]], [[drinking water]], recreation, industry, or [[agriculture]]; and to prioritize those water bodies for TMDL development. These inventories are known as '''303(d) Lists''' and characterize waters as '''fully supporting,''' '''impaired,''' or in some cases '''threatened''' for beneficial uses.

==Planning process==
Beneficial use determinations must have sufficient credible [[water quality]] data for TMDL planning.

Throughout the U.S., data are often lacking adequate spatial or temporal coverage to reliably establish the sources and magnitude of water quality degradation.

TMDL planning in large watersheds is a process that typically involves the following steps:  
# Watershed Characterization—understanding the basic physical, environmental, and human elements of the watershed.
# Impairment Status—analyzing existing data to determine if waters fully support beneficial uses
# Data Gaps and Monitoring Report—identification of any additional data needs and [[water quality#Sampling and measurement|monitoring]] recommendations
# Source Assessment—identification of sources of pollutants, and magnitude of sources.
# Load Allocation—determination of natural pollutant load, and load from human activities (i.e. diffuse nonpoint sources and point discharges).
# Set Targets—establishment of water quality targets intended to restore or maintain beneficial uses.
# TMDL Implementation Plan—a watershed management strategy to attain established targets.

===Water quality targets===
The purpose of water quality targets is to protect or restore beneficial uses and protect human health.  These targets may include state/federal numerical water quality standards or narrative standards, i.e. within the range of "natural" conditions.  Establishing targets to restore beneficial uses is challenging and sometimes controversial.  For example, the restoration of a fishery may require reducing temperatures, nutrients, sediments, and improving habitat.

Necessary values for each pollutant target to restore fisheries can be uncertain.  The potential for a water body to support a fishery even in a pristine state can be uncertain.

===Background===
Calculating the TMDL for any given body of water involves the combination of factors that contribute to the problem of nutrient concentrated runoff.  Bodies of water are tested for contaminants based on their intended use.  Each body of water is tested similarly but designated with a different TMDL. Drinking water reservoirs are designated differently from areas for public swimming and water bodies intended for fishing are designated differently from water located in wildlife conservation areas.  The size of the water body also is taken into consideration when TMDL calculating is undertaken.  The larger the body of water, the greater the amounts of contaminants can be present and still maintain a Margin of Safety.  The ''Margin of Safety (MOS)'' is numeric estimate included in the TMDL calculation, sometimes 10% of the TMDL, intended to allow a safety buffer between the calculated TMDL and the actual load that will allow the water body to meet its beneficial use (since the natural world is complex and several variables may alter future conditions).  TMDL is the end product of all point and non-point source pollutants of a single contaminant.  Pollutants that originate from a point source are given allowable levels of contaminants to be discharged; this is the ''Waste Load Allocation (WLA).''  Nonpoint source pollutants are also calculated into the TMDL equation with ''Load Allocation (LA).''

===Calculation===
The calculation of a TMDL is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;TMDL = WLA + LA + MOS&lt;/math&gt;
where WLA is the waste load allocation for point sources, LA is the load allocation for nonpoint sources, and MOS is the margin of safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A. Shirmohammadi |author2=I. Chaubey |author3=R. D. Harmel |author4=D. D. Bosch |author5=R. Muñoz-Carpena |author6=C. Dharmasri |author7=A. Sexton |author8=M. Arabi |author9=M. L. Wolfe |author10=J. Frankenberger |author11=C. Graff |author12=T. M. Sohrabi |title=Uncertainty in TMDL Models |journal=Transactions of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers |year=2006 |volume=49 |issue=4 |doi=10.13031/2013.21741 |pages=1033–1049|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=1403&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Load allocations===
Load allocations are equally challenging as setting targets.  Load allocations provide a framework for determining the relative share of natural sources and human sources of pollution.

The natural background load for a pollutant may be imprecisely understood. Industrial dischargers, [[farming|farmers]], [[land development|land developers]], [[Local government in the United States|municipalities]], natural resource agencies, and other watershed stakeholders each have a vested interest in the outcome.

==Implementation==
To implement TMDLs with point sources, wasteload allocations are incorporated into discharge permits for these sources.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-writers-manual ''NPDES Permit Writers' Manual.''] "Chapter 6: Water Quality-Based Effluent Limitations." September 2010. Document No. EPA-833-K-10-001.&lt;/ref&gt; The permits are issued by EPA or delegated state agencies under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ([[NPDES]]). [[Nonpoint source pollution|Nonpoint source discharges]] (e.g. agriculture) are generally in a voluntary compliance scenario.  The TMDL implementation plan is intended to help bridge this divide and ensure that watershed beneficial uses are restored and maintained. Local watershed groups play a critical role in educating stakeholders, generating funding, and implementing projects to reduce nonpoint sources of pollution.

* In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] introduced the practice of limiting Jewish population to a small number of the most wealthy families, known as "[[protected Jew]]s" (''Schutzjuden'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=571 Certificate Confirming Payment of Protection Money (''Schutzgeld'') for a Jewish Resident (1833)]&lt;/ref&gt; The first-born son in such families inherited this [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]; other children were considered useless by the authorities and had the choice of either abstaining from marriage or leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Simon Dubnow |first=Simon |last=Dubnow |title=The Newest History of the Jewish People, 1789–1914 |location= |publisher= |isbn= }}{{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following the establishment of the [[Pale of Settlement]] by [[Imperial Russia]], only "useful Jews" ({{lang-ru|полезные евреи}}) were allowed to live outside the Pale; these included Jews such as wealthy first-rung merchants ({{lang-ru|купцы первой гильдии}}), persons who had received [[higher education]], [[cantonist]]s (after serving their full term in the army), and some other categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How Russia Shaped the Modern World: From Art to Anti-Semitism, Ballet to Bolshevism |first=Steven G. |last=Marks |page=142 |isbn=0-691-11845-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive4/russia/russia.htm Russia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120013849/http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive4/russia/russia.htm |date=2008-11-20 }} at Institute for Jewish Policy Research&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">In mathematics and [[logic]], a '''vacuous truth''' is a [[Statement (logic)|statement]] that asserts that [[Universal quantification|all]] members of the [[empty set]] have a certain [[Property (philosophy)|property]]. For example, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned off" will be [[Truth|true]] whenever there are no [[cell phone]]s in the room. In this case, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned ''on''" would also be vacuously true, as would the [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] of the two: "all cell phones in the room are turned on ''and'' turned off".

More formally, a relatively [[Well-definition|well-defined]] usage refers to a [[Counterfactual conditional|conditional]] statement with a false [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]. One example of such a statement is "if [[Uluru]] is in [[France]], then the [[Eiffel Tower]] is in [[Bolivia]]". Such statements are considered vacuous because the fact that the antecedent is false prevents using the statement to infer anything about the truth value of the [[consequent]]. They are true because a [[material conditional]] is defined to be true when the antecedent is false (regardless of whether the conclusion is true).

In [[pure mathematics]], vacuously true statements are not generally of interest by themselves, but they frequently arise as the base case of proofs by [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algorithms and Data Structures: The Science of Computing|first1=Douglas L.|last1=Baldwin|first2=Greg W.|last2=Scragg|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn= 9781285225128|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETA9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This notion has relevance in [[pure mathematics]], as well as in any other field which uses [[classical logic]].

Outside of mathematics, statements which can be characterized informally as vacuously true can be misleading. Such statements make reasonable assertions about [[Qualifier|qualified]] objects which [[Nonexistence|do not actually exist]]. For example, a child might tell their parent "I ate every vegetable on my plate", when there were no vegetables on the child's plate to begin with.

== Scope of the concept ==

A statement &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is "vacuously true" if it [[Logical form|resembles]] the statement &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is known to be false.

Statements that can be reduced ([[Mutatis mutandis|with suitable transformations]]) to this basic form include the following [[Universal quantifier|universally quantified]] statements:
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x: P(x) \Rightarrow Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where it is the case that &lt;math&gt;\forall x: \neg P(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in A: Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[empty set|empty]].
* &lt;math&gt;\forall \xi: Q(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;, where the symbol &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is restricted to a [[type (type theory)|type]] that has no representatives.

Vacuous truth most commonly appears in [[classical logic]], which in particular is [[Binary decision|two-valued]]. However, vacuous truth also appears in, for example, [[intuitionistic logic]] in the same situations given above. Indeed, if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; will yield vacuous truth in any logic that uses the [[material conditional]]; if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Contradiction|necessary falsehood]], then it will also yield vacuous truth under the [[strict conditional]].

Other non-classical logics (for example, [[relevance logic]]) may attempt to avoid vacuous truths by using alternative conditionals (for example, the [[counterfactual conditional]]).

== Examples ==

These examples, one from [[mathematics]] and one from [[natural language]], illustrate the concept:

"For any integer x, if x &gt; 5 then x &gt; 3."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What precisely is a vacuous truth?|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1257728}}&lt;/ref&gt; – This statement is [[Truth|true]] non-vacuously (since some [[integer]]s are greater than 5), but some of its implications are only vacuously true: for example, when x is the integer 2, the statement implies the vacuous truth that "if 2 &gt; 5 then 2 &gt; 3".

"All my children are cats" is a vacuous truth when spoken by someone without children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30459">'''Vexatious litigation''' is legal action which is brought, regardless of its merits, solely to [[harass]] or subdue an [[wiktionary:adversary|adversary]]. It may take the form of a primary [[frivolous lawsuit]] or may be the repetitive, burdensome, and unwarranted filing of meritless motions in a matter which is otherwise a meritorious [[cause of action]]. Filing vexatious litigation is considered an abuse of the [[judicial process]] and may result in [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] against the offender.

A single action, even a frivolous one, is usually not enough to raise a litigant to the level of being declared vexatious. Rather, a pattern of frivolous legal actions is typically required to rise to the level of vexatious. Repeated and severe instances by a single [[lawyer]] or [[law firm|firm]] can result in eventual [[disbarment]].

Some [[jurisdiction]]s have a list of vexatious litigants: people who have repeatedly abused the legal system. Because lawyers could be disbarred for participating in this abuse of the legal process, vexatious litigants are often unable to retain legal counsel, and such litigants therefore represent themselves in court. Those on the vexatious litigant list are usually either forbidden from any further legal action, or are required to obtain prior permission from a senior judge before taking any legal action. The process by which a person is added to the list varies among jurisdictions. In [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] jurisdictions, declaring someone a vexatious litigant is considered to be a serious measure and rarely occurs, as judges and officials are reluctant to curtail a person's access to the courts.
 
These legal actions occur in some countries of the former [[British Empire]], where the [[Common Law]] System still remains: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], and [[United States|US]], which are specified below. The [[Civil Law (legal system)|Civil (Codified/Continental) Law]] does not provide this kind of gate to limit equal access of citizens to the justice system.

==History of legislation against vexatious litigation==
The concept of vexatious litigation entered into law in 1896 with the Vexatious Actions Act, enacted in [[England]] and soon extended to [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. This was  primarily a response to the actions of [[Alexander Chaffers]], a solicitor who filed numerous actions against [[Travers Twiss#Scandal|leading members]] of Victorian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian Simpson |title=The Rule of Law in International Affairs |journal=Proceedings of the British Academy |volume= 125 |date=2003 |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; When costs were awarded against him, he failed to pay.&lt;ref name = "alv"&gt;Alvin Stauber, "Litigious Paranoia: Confronting And Controlling Abusive Litigation In The United States, The United Kingdom", ''International Review of Business Research Papers'', Vol.5 No. 1 January 2009, pp.11- 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Taggart (2004). ALEXANDER CHAFFERS AND THE GENESIS OF THE 
VEXATIOUS ACTIONS ACT 1896. The Cambridge Law Journal, 63, pp 656684 
{{doi|10.1017/S0008197304006713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such law outside Britain, the [[Supreme Court Act, 1927]] was passed in Australia nearly thirty years later. This too was prompted by the behaviour of an individual, Rupert Millane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rosalind Dixon |author2=George Williams |date=2015 |title=The High Court, the Constitution and Australian Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqewBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=Rupert+Millane&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3W7vsxdrXX&amp;sig=RqtqsMdd1L_K95V2GfIyrx9w0gI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA6I6XvfTaAhVj8IMKHfBeBpsQ6AEIIzAF |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=133 |isbn=9781107043664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Vexatious Litigant law in the United States was enacted in [[California]] in 1963. By 2007 five US states had passed similar legislation: California, [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]], [[Ohio]], and [[Texas]].&lt;ref name = "alv"/&gt;

==Laws by country==

===Australia===

====High Court====
The [[High Court of Australia]] has declared only three people to be vexatious litigants in its century-old existence, whereas the Australian [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] system, established in 1976, has at least 36 names on its barred registry.&lt;ref name="Michael Pelly"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/26/1085461835965.html?from=storylhs|title=Nuisances in court: judges get tough on serial pests|author=Michael Pelly| publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=2004-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New South Wales====
In [[New South Wales]], there are currently 35 people on the [[New South Wales Supreme Court]]'s vexatious litigants register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.justice.nsw.gov.au/Pages/SCO2_practiceprocedure/SCO2_vexatiousproceedings.aspx#Istherearegisterofvexatiouslitigantsandtheordersthatapplytothem?|title=Vexatious Proceedings|last=|first=|date=April 15, 2016|website=|publisher=Supreme Court of New South Wales|access-date=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Queensland====
In [[Queensland]], the process for having someone declared a vexatious litigant is governed by the ''[[Vexatious Proceedings Act 2005]]'', which supplanted an earlier Act.&lt;ref name="From Archive.org-1818794"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.qld.gov.au/151.htm |title=Vexatious litigants |work=courts.qld.gov.au |date=November 28, 2007 |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326220116/http://www.courts.qld.gov.au/151.htm |archivedate=March 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, the Act defines a vexatious proceeding to include a proceeding brought without merit or any prospect of success, with the consequence that it is not necessary to prove the existence of any improper motive in order to obtain relief under the Act.

====South Australia====
In South Australia, vexatious litigation laws were enacted in the mid-1930s with the ''[[Supreme Court Act 1935-1936]]'', following similar laws enacted in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;Stauber, Alvin. (2009). "[http://www.bizresearchpapers.com/attachments_2009_01_14/2.Alvin.pdf Litigious Paranoia: Confronting And Controlling Abusive Litigation In The United States, The United Kingdom, And Australia]". ''International Review of Business Research Papers''. 5:11. p22. Retrieved 5 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the [[Mike Rann|Rann government]] acted to strengthen the ability of the courts to act against vexatious litigants by "increasing the range of courts and tribunals that can declare people as vexatious".&lt;ref name="McGregor2010-11-06"&gt;McGregor, Ken. (6 November 2010). "[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/government-targets-serial-litigants-clogging-up-the-courts/story-e6frea83-1225948535382 Government targets serial litigants clogging up the courts]". ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', Adelaide, South Australia. Retrieved 5 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that date, few people had been banned from bringing litigation to South Australian courts – by 2005, only two people were listed as having been declared as vexatious litigants, the first in 1997 and the second declared during that year.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Nick. (19 July 2005). "Legal History in the Making as Woman Faces Courts Ban: Litigant has her day in court – maybe for the last time." ''The Advertiser'', Adelaide, South Australia. p10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hough, Andrew. (12 November 2005). "Serial litigant barred". ''The Advertiser'', Adelaide, South Australia. p25.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, at least two other South Australians have been found to be vexatious litigants.&lt;ref name="McGregor2010-11-06" /&gt;

====Victoria====
{{As of|2006}}, only 13 people—including convicted mass-murderer [[Julian Knight (murderer)|Julian Knight]]—had been declared vexatious litigants since the law was introduced in 1930.&lt;ref name="DJ Lindsey"&gt;{{cite news | first=Fergus | last=Shiel | title=Annoying litigant is back | date=2006-04-10 | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/annoying-litigant-is-back/2006/04/09/1144521210696.html | work =[[The Age]] | accessdate = 2008-07-06 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western Australia====
Legislation has existed since 1930, but is under review as of limited use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070829161357/http://www.lrc.justice.wa.gov.au/2publications/reports/P92-CJS/consults/2-11unreaslits.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Under the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', section 92(14),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html#distribution |title=Legislative Authority of Parliament of Canada |accessdate=2008-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; each province is vested with the power to enact and apply laws relating to the administration of justice within its own territory.

In Canada, Section 40 of the ''Federal Court Act''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605031024/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/F-7///en?page=1]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Ontario Section 140 of the ''Courts of Justice Act'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c43_e.htm |title=Law Document English View &amp;#124; Ontario.ca |website=E-laws.gov.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; restrict the ability to introduce or continue proceedings for those who have instituted vexatious proceedings or conducted proceedings in a vexatious manner.

====Quebec====
In Quebec, the Code of Civil Procedure is the principal legislation that sets rules related to civil procedure.

Under section 46 of the Code of Civil Procedure,&lt;ref&gt;L.R.Q., ch. C-25, s. 46&lt;/ref&gt; all judicial courts and judges in Quebec are vested with "...all the powers necessary for the exercise of their jurisdiction". Furthermore, they may:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"…at any time and in all matters, whether in first instance or in appeal, issue orders to safeguard the rights of the parties, for such time and on such conditions as they may determine. As well, they may, in the matters brought before them, even on their own initiative, issue injunctions or reprimands, suppress writings or declare them libellous, and make such orders as are appropriate to deal with cases for which no specific remedy is provided by law."&lt;ref&gt;Code of civil procedure, L.R.Q., ch. C-25, s. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 46 vests a very broad power on judicial courts and judges to ensure that the administration of justice is conducted according to decorum and according to the remedial nature of justice. As the courts's decisions have shown it, the authority to declare a litigant as vexatious is directly tributary to the power conferred by section 46.

Cases illustrating the application of section 46 are numerous. Among them, there are: ''Nguiagain v. Commission de la fonction publique'',&lt;ref&gt;[1996] R.J.Q. 3009&lt;/ref&gt; in which the judge rejected the plaintiff's motion for a ''[[mandamus]]'' to enjoin his union to revise the grievance that he had filed on the grounds that the motion was groundless and abusive; ''De Niverville c. Descôteaux'',&lt;ref&gt;[1997] R.J.Q. 1049&lt;/ref&gt; where an injunction was rendered declaring the respondent, disbarred lawyer Descôteaux, as a vexatious litigant due to the multiple unfounded and frivolous actions that he had sought against the plaintiff De Niverville; and in ''Fabrikant v. Corbin'',&lt;ref&gt;J.E. 2000-1347&lt;/ref&gt; a motion to declare the plaintiff [[Valery Fabrikant]] as a vexatious litigant was granted to the defendant, Dr. Corbin. In all of the above cited cases, a litigant was only declared vexatious following a proceeding instated by the opposite party.

Moreover, section 46’s scope is limited to judicial courts and judges. Administrative tribunals are legislative creations and they can only exist and function within the limits that are imposed by law. Administrative tribunals in Quebec cannot declare a person a vexatious litigant.

As per section 90 of the ''Rules of Practice of the Superior Court of Québec in Civil Matters'',&lt;ref&gt;L.R.Q., ch. C-25, r. 8&lt;/ref&gt; such litigants are now indexed in a registry kept by the Chief Justice in the judiciary district of Montreal. Lawyer and author Claude Duchesnay has reported in May 2003 that a document on the Quebec attorney general’s intranet contains the name of 58 persons who must obtain permission prior to instating proceedings before the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Claude DUCHESNAY, « Se représenter seul », Congrès du Barreau du Québec, Compte rendu des activités de formation, Le Journal Barreau, édition du 1 er  août 2002, p. VII et VIII&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], a court may, of its own motion or on application, order that no proceedings, either of a certain type or at all, may be issued by a certain person without leave of that court or some other court, for a specified time, or indefinitely. Such an order is referred to in legal circles as an [[Isaac Wunder order]] after Isaac Wunder who made several claims against the Hospitals Trust claiming [[sweepstakes]] prizes, but the claims were found to be groundless and the case deemed [[frivolous or vexatious]]. He was prohibited from taking further High Court proceedings in the action without leave of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsijournal.ie/html/Volume%201%20No.%201/1%5B1%5D_Moore_Isaac%20Wunder%20Orders.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721124946/http://www.jsijournal.ie/html/Volume%201%20No.%201/1%5B1%5D_Moore_Isaac%20Wunder%20Orders.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand a person may be declared a vexatious litigant by a High Court Judge on the application of the [[Attorney-General of New Zealand|Attorney-General]]. A vexatious litigant must then apply to a [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] Judge for leave to commence any action. A decision by the High Court whether or not to grant leave cannot be appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 88B of the Judicature Act 1908|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1908/0089/latest/DLM147394.html|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
{{see also|Civil restraint order}}
Courts in [[England and Wales]] have the means of escalating the sanctions against a litigant who makes applications to the court that are "totally without merit":&lt;ref&gt;''[[Civil Procedure Rules]]'', Practice Direction to Pt.3 3CPD.2.1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil restraint order]]s allow courts to forbid applications for court hearings without the permission of a judge. There are three types of CRO: limited, extended and general, with different scopes of application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/civil-restraint-orders--2|title=Civil restraint orders - Detailed guidance - GOV.UK|date=1 October 2014|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further applications totally without merit can lead to withdrawal of the right of [[appeal]]. Harassment of the court and court officials can lead to a penal prohibition notice, prohibiting the litigant from contacting or approaching the court without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Litigation|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|year=2005|isbn=0-421-90690-1|edition=12th|location=London|pages=para 7.011|nopp=true|author1=O'Hare, J.|author2=Browne, K.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Vexatious Actions (Scotland) Act 1898]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/61-62/35|title=Vexatious Actions (Scotland) Act 1898|date=|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lord Advocate]] can apply for an order under section 1 of that Act to prevent any person accused of vexatious litigation from raising any and all legal proceedings "unless he obtains the leave of a judge sitting in the Outer House on the Bills in the [[Court of Session]], having satisfied the judge that such legal proceeding is not vexatious." A list of people who have had such an order brought against them is published on the Scottish Courts website. As of June 2018 there are ten names on this list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/the-courts/supreme-courts/about-the-supreme-courts/general-department/vexatious-litigants|title=Vexatious Litigants|date=|website=Scotcourts.gov.uk|accessdate=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
====California====
Under [[California]] law&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130911060648/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=ccp&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=391-391.8]&lt;/ref&gt; a vexatious litigant is someone who does any of the following, most of which require that the litigant be proceeding ''[[Pro se legal representation in the United States|pro se]]'', i.e., representing himself:
#In the immediately preceding seven-year period has commenced, prosecuted, or maintained ''[[in propria persona]]'' at least five litigations other than in a small claims court that have been (i) finally determined adversely to the person or (ii) unjustifiably permitted to remain pending at least two years without having been brought to trial or hearing.
#After a litigation has been finally determined against the person, repeatedly relitigates or attempts to relitigate, ''in propria persona'', either (i) the validity of the determination against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally determined or (ii) the cause of action, claim, controversy, or any of the issues of fact or law, determined or concluded by the final determination against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally determined.
#In any litigation while acting ''in propria persona'', repeatedly files unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.
#Has previously been declared to be a vexatious litigant by any [[U.S. state|state]] or federal [[court of record]] in any action or proceeding based upon the same or substantially similar facts, transaction, or occurrence.

Appeals of an existing action do not count as “final determinations”. Appeals and writs that are related to a current action do not count as “final determinations” or additional determinations, because until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted the determinations cannot be construed as “final”.&lt;ref&gt;''Childs v. Painewebber, Inc.'' (1994), 29 Cal.App.4th 982&lt;/ref&gt; A judgment is final for all purposes when all avenues for direct review have been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;''First Western Development Co. v. Superior Court'', (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 860, 864, 261 Cal.Rptr. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Interlocutory decisions before a judgment cannot be considered “final determinations”.&lt;ref&gt;''Holcomb v. U.S. Bank Nat. Ass'n'', (2005), 129 Cal.App.4th 1494, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 578&lt;/ref&gt; Docket lists show nothing about qualifying merit of interim motions (Id.)

To meet the unspecified criteria for "repeated" motions or litigations, the number must be much more than two, and the rule based on case law seems to be around 12. "While there is no bright line rule as to what constitutes “repeatedly,” most cases affirming the vexatious litigant designation involve situations where litigants have filed dozens of motions either during the pendency of an action or relating to the same judgment." &lt;ref&gt;''Bravo v. Ismaj'', (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 211, 120 Cal.Rptr.2d 879)&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeated motions must be "so devoid of merit and be so frivolous that they can be described as a flagrant [[abuse of the system]], have no reasonable probability of success, lack reasonable or probable cause or excuse, and are clearly meant to abuse the processes of the courts and to harass the adverse party than other litigants."&lt;ref&gt;''Morton v. Wagner'', (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 963, 67 Cal.Rptr.3d 818.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence that a litigant is a frequent plaintiff or defendant alone is insufficient to support a vexatious litigant designation.&lt;ref&gt;''Roston v. Edwards'',  (1982) 127 Cal.App.3d at 847, 179 Cal.Rptr. 830.&lt;/ref&gt; The moving party, in addition to demonstrating that the plaintiff is vexatious, must make an affirmative showing based on evidence that the case has little chance of prevailing on the merits. If the plaintiff is so determined, a bond may be required, and if the bond requirement is not met within a specified time period, a judgment of dismissal is ordered. A finding of vexatiousness is not an appealable order, but a dismissal for failure to post a bond requirement based on a judgment of vexatiousness is appealable.

[[Habeas corpus|Habeas petitions]] do not count towards vexatious litigant determination.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Bittaker'', (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1004, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 679.&lt;/ref&gt; Vexatiousness in Probate Actions are governed by a different standard (Cal. Prob. Code §1611&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oclaw.org/research/code/ca/PROB/1611./content.html |title=Cal. Prob. Code §1611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Notable vexatious litigants==
* '''[[Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris|Lawrence Bittaker]]''', who together with his partner Roy Norris was convicted of torturing and murdering five young girls in 1979. He filed 40 separate frivolous lawsuits against the state of California, including one claiming "cruel and unusual punishment" after being served a broken cookie. In 1993, he was declared a vexatious litigant and is forbidden from filing lawsuits without the permission of a lawyer or a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-20/news/ls-5250_1_vexatious-litigant-list |title=Courting Trouble : A Unique Law Turns the Tables on Those Who File Numerous or Frivolous Lawsuits |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=1995-11-20 |accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Alexander Chaffers''', a solicitor whose actions led to the first British law against vexatious litigation, the Vexatious Actions Act, 1896. Chaffers became notorious after accusing the wife of [[Travers Twiss]] of being a prostitute, and subsequently issued 48 proceedings against leading members of Victorian society in the 1890s. Costs awarded against Chaffers were never paid. After the act was passed, he became the first person to be declared a habitually vexatious litigant and barred from future litigation without judicial permission.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Taggart, "Alexander Chaffers and the Genesis of the Vexatious Actions Act 1896, ''The Cambridge Law Journal'', Volume 63, Issue 03, November 2004, pp 656-684.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Julian Knight (murderer)|Julian Knight]]''', convicted of the [[Hoddle Street massacre]] in Melbourne, Australia. Numerous actions, primarily seeking injunctions against the prison incarcerating him, have cost the Victorian government over [[Australian dollar|A$]]250,000 directly, plus some A$128,000 in outside legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/19/1097951666370.html?from=top5 |title=Hoddle Street killer banned from court |accessdate=2008-07-06 | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | date=2004-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''David James "Indian Chief" Lindsey''', a [[Melbourne]] man so declared after repeatedly suing doctors, insurance firms and companies such as [[Carlton &amp; United Breweries]] for smoking-related damages. On February 21, 2006, the Supreme Court of Appeal gave him leave to sue [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]], demonstrating that a vexatious litigant is not completely blocked from launching further court action.&lt;ref name="DJ Lindsey" /&gt;
* '''[[Andy Martin (American politician)|Andy Martin]]''' (Anthony Martin-Tragona), a [[perennial candidate]] for US elections, who has been barred since 1983 from filing any legal action in a United States federal court without permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/737/1254/ ''Martin-Trigona v.

* '''The [[Scientology and the legal system|Church of Scientology]]'''. "Plaintiffs (Scientologists) have abused the federal court system by using it, ''[[List of Latin phrases: I#inter alia|inter alia]]'', to attempt to destroy their opponents, rather than to resolve an actual dispute over trademark law or any other legal matter. This constitutes 'extraordinary, malicious, wanton and oppressive conduct.' As such, this case qualifies as an 'exceptional case' and fees should be awarded pursuant to the [[Lanham Act]]... It is abundantly clear that plaintiffs sought to harass the individual defendants and destroy the church defendants through massive over-litigation and other highly questionable litigation tactics. The [[Special Master]] has never seen a more glaring example of bad faith litigation than this." (''[[s:Religious Technology Center v. Scott (1996)]]'', U. S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7087">'''Victor Grippo''' (10 May 1936 – February 2002) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] painter, engraver and sculptor, considered the father of [[conceptual art]] in Argentina. He was born in [[Junín, Buenos Aires|Junín]], [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], the elder of two sons of an [[Italy|Italian]] [[immigration in Argentina|immigrant]] father and an Argentine mother of [[Albania|Albanese]] origin. 

== Life and Work ==
Grippo was raised in his birthtown, and in his youth he moved to the capital of the province, [[La Plata]], and then to the city of [[Buenos Aires]]. He studied [[Chemistry]] and [[Pharmacy]] in the [[Universidad Nacional de La Plata|University of La Plata]],&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Latin American and Caribbean Art|author=Jane Turner, ed.|first=|publisher=Macmillan Reference Limited|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=305–306|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended seminars by [[Héctor Cartier]] at the Fine Arts School. He had been interested in art from an early age. He started off as a painter and engraver in the 1950s, and in the 1960s he began experimenting with sculpture, and produced animated pieces (with engines and lighting).

In 1966 he held his first solo exhibition at the Lirolay gallery in Buenos Aires, presenting oils linked to geometric abstraction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.malba.org|title=Victor Grippo|last=|first=|date=|website=MALBA|archive-url=http://www.malba.org.ar/web/descargas/grippo.pdf|archive-date=12 Jun 2009|dead-url=|access-date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work he has sought a convergence between science and [[art]]. His work, one of whose main motives is the idea of transformation, has always revolved around daily life, the world of work, food and energy. From the beginning he used materials and unconventional means in his objects, sculptures and installations, to reflect on the social and spiritual conditions of the workers, of the artists. It belonged to the group of the thirteen, integrated by Jacques Bedel, Luis Fernando Benedit, Gregorio Dujovny, among others. Finally, this group becomes the CAYC Group. 

Between the years of 1968 and 1970 his works led to a luminous kinetic, machines were wrapped in fabrics, subjected to the surface passage of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sierra|first=Miguel Angel|date=2018|title=Anales de Química. La revista de la Real Sociedad Española de Química.|url=http://analesdequimica.es/index.php/AnalesQuimica|journal=Anales de Química|volume=114|pages=19-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victor Grippo researches the energy generation processes through very simple technical resources. One of the raw materials used in his work has been the [[potato]] (which he uses as a metaphor)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elogio de la Low- Tech. Historia y estética de las artes electrónicas en América Latina|last=Rodrigo|first=Alonso|publisher=Luna Editores|year=2015|isbn=978- 987- 45732- 1- 6|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|pages=57-58}}&lt;/ref&gt; food that was born in America, but after the conquest spread throughout Europe. 

Grippo, based on its cultural symbolism, used the energy contained in potatoes, forming [[Electric battery|electric batteries]] and connecting them with cables to operate different devices, from a radio to a [[multimeter]] that measured the energy generated. That kind of works became a classic of the artist who was developing in different facilities around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Using electrodes and measuring systems, the artist shows the latent power in plant life.

He creates facilities that are at the same time spaces of liberated energy, behind these works is also found a meaning referring to alchemy and to the efforts to transfigure the material world.

One of his most well-known works is Analogía I (1970), presented in the collective exhibition ''Art Systems I'', at the Museum of Modern Art, and which has been presented later in different versions in different parts of the world.

In 2002 [[Konex Foundation]] from Argentina granted him the Diamond [[Konex Award]], one of the most prestigious awards in Argentina, as the most important personality in the Visual Arts of his country in the last decade.

He made invaluable calculations for quantum physics, relating the atoms and the theories of the absorbent nebula in a totally renewing way with conceptual art, thus achieving a kind of tactile hologram.

The works of this artist no longer speak of the power that technology has to transform the lives of people, but rather of its articulation as an instrument of thought.

Grippo died in Buenos Aires in February 2002.

==Differences from other load-carrying bicycles==
While the Xtracycle is based on a standard [[Bicycle suspension|hardtail]] [[diamond frame]] with 26-inch or 622&amp;nbsp;mm (700c) wheels, the Xtracycle differs from other load-carrying bicycles in that it does not employ a [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebar]] basket, [[pannier]]s, or a [[bicycle trailer]]. Baskets are easy to attach and allow stowing of cargo in plain view. Panniers are often watertight or water resistant, and can be easily removed from their racks and carried as luggage. While trailers come in many designs and allow a bicycle to pull a significant amount of cargo, an Xtracycle allows for more stowage of large containers directly on the extended frame of the bicycle itself. Xtracycles are also called "sport utility bicycles" for their ability to carry larger loads than a normal bicycles having baskets or panniers, while also maintaining the "sporty" maneuverability of conventional "short" bikes.

==History and spin-offs==
The FreeRadical was conceived by Ross Evans at [[Stanford University]] and developed during his work in the mid-1990s managing a "[[Bikes Not Bombs]]" project in [[Nicaragua]], where having a bicycle enhances a person's employment opportunities. In 1998 Evans and his friend Kipchoge Spencer created Xtracycle Inc to manufacture and market the invention, as well as a nonprofit organization, Worldbike, devoted to encourage a bicycle-centric lifestyle and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Retherford, Brittany. [http://www.theunion.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006101120147 One step at a time: Duo's film, innovations geared to a healthier world] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030509/http://www.theunion.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006101120147 |date=September 27, 2007 }}. ''The Union'', (January 12, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the FreeRadical qualifies as an aftermarket bike accessory, its growing acceptance has sparked an Xtracycle aftermarket not formally connected with Xtracycle Inc: varieties of [https://web.archive.org/web/20060902052655/http://www.rideyourbike.com/xtracycle.html specialized kickstands], [http://clevercycles.com/cleverchimp-stokemonkey-human-electric-hybrid-drive electric-assist motors], and even bike-mounted blenders have come to market, even though each requires the prior purchase of a FreeRadical or other Xtracycle-compatible frame to function properly.

===Big Dummy===
[[File:Surly Big Dummy.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Surly Big Dummy]] with handlebars and foot rests for a second rider]]
Xtracycle Inc has worked with various bicycle manufacturers to build purpose-built extended bicycles compatible with their accessories.  The first to actually produce and market an integrated Xtracycle frameset was [[Surly Bikes]] with the Big Dummy.&lt;ref name="startrib"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; XInc continues to form similar covenants with manufacturers in all price ranges, with the goal of making the Xtracycle less of a niche product and more mainstream. XInc is also working on FreeRadical attachments sized for children's and youths' bicycles on the theory of "catch 'em young and train 'em right."

Other applications for the FreeRadical have included linking two Xtracycles to support a mobile stage for use in parades and street fairs, and a computerized chalkpowder-printer device mounted on an Xtracycle that leaves a dot-matrix trail of messages on the street.&lt;ref&gt;Kinberg, Joshua.

===Open source===
In 2008, Xtracycle put their longtail bike frame specifications online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.commutebybike.com/2008/10/01/xtracycle-open-source-specs-now-online/

| accessdate = 2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their project to open source their longtail frame design. They’ve created a Longtail Standard and logoing to allow vendors to design their products to fit in the Xtracycle FreeRadical ecosystem. The "Longtail Technology" logo can be used on bikes, accessories or packaging. The [[open source|open sourcing]] of the patented technology was meant to stimulate the cargo bike movement, while developing a standard for "longtail" frames and accessories. Several frame and accessory makers have adopted the standards, while others have developed competing and incompatible long-frame cargo bike designs.
However, the documents are no longer freely available, and now require an agreement with Xtracycle first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
