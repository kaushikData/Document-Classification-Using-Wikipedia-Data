      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2843">In [[anthropology]], an '''acephalous society''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀκέφαλος "headless") is a society which lacks political leaders or hierarchies. Such groups are also known [[Social stratification#Non-stratified societies|non-stratified]] societies. Typically these societies are small-scale,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51115271|title=Dictionary of the social sciences|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Calhoun, Craig J., 1952-, Oxford University Press.|isbn=9780199891184|location=New York|oclc=51115271}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized into bands or tribes that make decisions through [[consensus decision making]] rather than appointing permanent chiefs or kings. Most foraging or [[hunter-gatherer]] societies are acephalous {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Some exceptions to this trend are the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus River Valley Civilization]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]] and the [[Cucuteni–Trypillia culture|Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Worshipping Power: An Anarchist History of State Formation|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When these societies do not possess distinctions of rank, they are described as [[egalitarian]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In scientific literature covering native African societies and the effect of [[European colonialism]] on them the term is often used to describe groups of people living in a settlement with "no government in the sense of a group able to exercise effective control over both the people and their territory".&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Daannaa: "The Acephalous Society And The Indirect Rule System in Africa, Journal of Legal Pluralism And Unofficial Law, Nr. 34, p. 62, http://www.jlp.bham.ac.uk/volumes/34/daannaa-art.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect the term is also often used as synonymous to "stateless society".&lt;ref name="Ayittey"&gt;Daannaa, p61; G.N. Ayittey: "STATELESS SOCIETIES: The Igbo, the Fulani, the Somali", A New Nigeria, http://seunfakze.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/stateless-societies-the-igbo-the-fulani-the-somali-by-prof-g-n-ayittey/&lt;/ref&gt; Such societies are described as consensus-democratic in opposition to the majority-democratic systems of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Ayittey, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Igbo people|Igbo Nation]] in West Africa is alleged to be an acephalous or egalitarian society.&lt;ref name="Ayittey"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=September 2017}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Akiba's Trip 2 combat screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In-game screenshot of the combat system, demonstrating the player's ability to strip clothes off enemies]] 

In ''Akiba's Trip'', the player explores [[Akihabara]] and strip the clothes off "Synthisters". There are different things to do such as buy items from shops, enter maid cafes to eat food and play games, or head to the battle arena to train and increase your rank, eventually being about to fight Antoinette. The player character is customizable, with the player able to pick what headgear and clothing to wear, and what walking style and stripping style to use. Character models, voices and skin color are unlocked when beating the game, with some being unlocked when finishing the game with certain endings. Non-playable characters consist of otakus, tourists, maids and more along with "Synthisters" who can be seen with the mobile app Shion developed which is unlocked later in the game. The story is played out as a visual novel where the player gets to choose from three different phrases to say to progress the story, akin to the ''Way of the Samurai'' series, also developed by Acquire.{{what|date=September 2017}} Certain options will increase the player character's affection level with certain characters that will diverge into different endings for the player to experience. A hint system is unlocked when beating the game to ensure that the affection level will increase for the character that the player chooses.

When initiated into battle, the player chooses what weapon to use. The player aims attacks at the lower, middle or upper part of the body to weaken the enemy's clothing, with each body part having their own respective button. There is a combo attack when pressing the attack button repeatedly, a forward attack for moving the analog forward while attacking, a strong attack for moving the analog back while attacking along with an aerial attack and guard attack. Guarding dodges all attacks but leaves the player character vulnerable to having their clothes stripped but the player can also counter-attack the "Synthister's" attack or if their clothing is flashing, can counter-strip their clothes. When the clothes are flashing, the player can hold the attack button to strip the clothes off but if the clothes are not flashing, they can hold the button and then mash it to force strip it. The more the player strips a certain type of clothing, their strip skill will increase, allowing the clothes not to tear so that they can keep the clothing for inventory. If the meter on the top left of the screen is filled and if the player is allied with Shizuku, Touka, Kati, Shion or Nana, they can perform a unison strip, where they do heavy damage to a "Synthister" and cause the other "Synthisters" to be dizzy, stripping them until they are no longer dizzy or the chain strip ends.

==Synopsis==

===Plot===
{{more plot|date=June 2015}}

Set in [[Akihabara]], the shopping area has been invaded by creatures known as "Synthisters" who prey on the patrons of Akihabara, feasting on their social energy and will to live. These enemies can only be stopped by direct exposure to sunlight, meaning that the player is required to defeat these synthisters by violently stripping off their clothes and exposing them to sunlight.

Following the game's release in the west, reception among reviewers have been mixed. [[Crunchyroll]] noted that the game features a significant amount of content and provides an authentic feel of Akihabara, however does have issues with its combat system.&lt;ref&gt;2014-08-19, [http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2014/08/18/feature-akibas-trip-undead-and-undressed-review FEATURE: "Akiba's Trip: Undead and Undressed" Review], Crunchyroll.&lt;/ref&gt; Cinema Blend rated the game 3.5 out of 5, noting it to be a unique game unlike any other game on the market,&lt;ref&gt;2014-08-13, [http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Review-Akiba-Trip-Undead-Undressed-Celebrates-All-Things-Otaku-66735.html Review: Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed Celebrates All Things Otaku], Cinema Blend.&lt;/ref&gt; and Just Push Start gave a score of 9.3, praising the manner in which the setting is presented.&lt;ref&gt;2014-08-12, [http://www.justpushstart.com/2014/08/akibas-trip-undead-undressed-ps3-review/ Akiba’s Trip: Undead and Undressed (PS3) Review], Just Push Start.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Trends. ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' rated the game a 3.5/5 praising the gameplay and amount of content, but criticizing the technical problems and fan-service. They also stated that "Akiba is an [[open-world]] game, but it’s hard to fully get lost in it because of how many loading screens you run into when traveling from section to section of the city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hale |first=Bradly |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/08/13/review-akibas-trip-undead-undressed/98871/ |title=Review: Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed  |publisher=Hardcore Gamer |date=2014-08-13 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubed3 gave it 5/10, stating, "Fun characters and a creative concept for combat with an immense amount of character customization are all undermined by the terribly executed and jerky unpolished gameplay."&lt;ref&gt;2014-08-18, [http://www.cubed3.com/review/1542/1/akibas-trip-undead-and-undressed-ps-vita.html Akiba’s Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed Review], Cubed3.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its PC release, HonestGamers praised the game's lampooning of a source material it clearly loved though noted the battle system was "gloriously clumsy", ultimately awarding it 4/5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartley |first=Gary |url=http://www.honestgamers.com/12576/pc/akibas-trip-undead-undressed/review.html/ |title=Review: Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed |publisher=HonestGamers |date=2015-06-07 |accessdate=2015-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624021207/http://www.honestgamers.com/12576/pc/akibas-trip-undead-undressed/review.html |archivedate=2015-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3898">An '''Aonach''' or '''Óenach''' was an ancient [[Ireland|Irish]] public national assembly called upon the death of a [[king]], [[Queen regnant|queen]], notable [[Wise old man|sage]] or [[warrior]] as part of [[ancestor worship]] practices.&lt;ref name="Nally2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=T. H. Nally|title=The Aonac Tailteann and the Tailteann Games Their History and Ancient Associations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SObPJ02EiwMC|accessdate=31 July 2012|date=30 June 2008|publisher=Jesson Press|isbn=978-1-4097-8189-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the entertainment, the óenach was an occasion on which kings and notables met under [[truce]] and where [[law]]s were pronounced and confirmed.

The Aonach had three functions; honoring the dead, proclaiming [[law]]s, and funeral games and festivities to entertain. The first function took between one and three days depending on the importance of the deceased, guests would sing mourning chants called the ''[[Guba (chant)|Guba]]'' after which [[druid]]s would improvise songs in memory of the dead called a ''[[Cepóg]]''. The dead would then be burnt on a [[funeral pyre]]. The second function would then be carried out by the [[Ollamh Érenn]], giving out laws to the people via bards and druids and culminating in the igniting of another massive fire. The custom of rejoicing after a funeral was then enshrined in the ''[[Cuiteach Fuait]]'', games of mental and physical ability accompanied by a large market for traders. 

The most notable fair, that held under the auspices of the [[High King of Ireland]] and the [[Uí Néill]], was the ''Óenach Tailten'' or "[[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]]", which is given [[prehistoric]] origins by medieval writers. This was held at [[Teltown]], in modern [[County Meath]], as late as 1770. The compilers of the [[Irish annals]] considered violence and disorders at this óenach, or the failure of the incumbent High King to hold the fair, to be of note. The [[Irish Free State]] held [[Tailteann Games (Irish Free State)|revivals of the Tailteann Games]] from 1924 to 1932. 

Other important assemblies included that of [[Tlachtga]], held on the [[Hill of Ward]] at [[Samhain]], that of [[Carman]], held in [[County Wexford]], that of [[Uisnech]], held at [[Beltane]] and that of Raigne in [[Kingdom of Ossory|Osraige]]. Not all had pagan calendrical associations. The ''Óenach Colmáin'', probably held at [[Lynally]], was named for Saint [[Elo Colman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2729">'''The Awaze Tribune''' ('''AwazeTribune''') is an Eritrean [[news satire]] organization that publishes articles on international, national, and local news. Based in [[Asmara]], Eritrea.  The website carries articles that may cover current events, both real and fictional, satirizing the tone and format of traditional news organizations with stories, editorials, [[op-ed]] pieces, and [[Vox populi|man-in-the-street]] interviews using a traditional news website layout and an editorial voice modeled after [[the New York Times]], and the usage of the [[AP Stylebook|AP Style]] of news writing.

== History ==
The articles of AwazeTribune mostly revolve around the coverage of real or imaginary events in a satirical and offbeat way, taking again most of the press codes. AwazeTribune appeared first an element on [[Twitter]] that began in February 2016, during the American Presidential Elections, before being transformed to becoming a website. Since then, many of its articles were relayed in the press.

In its about page, the website claims to have been founded in 32 A.D., to have covered the [[baptism]] of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and the birth of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Mohammad]], and to receive 14 billion unique daily hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://awazetribune.com/index.php/about/|title=About|date=2016-07-02|newspaper=Awaze Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the curators is yet unknown, in a recent interview with [[Radio France Internationale]], one of the anonymous personalities associated with the website flatly declined to be identified stating that " the message of AT outweighs the identity of the curators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20161114-erythree-awase-site-parodique-actualite-denoncer-dictature|title=Erythrée: Awaze, un site parodique d’actualité pour dénoncer la dictature - RFI|newspaper=RFI Afrique|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Many users of social media have taken AwazeTribune articles to be literal (especially those which address controversial topics), and have expressed their anger and confusion online failing, according to one of the website's managers, to 'comprehend that the site makes a [[tongue-in-cheek]] news commentary revolving around the secretive Eritrean regime'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://information.tv5monde.com/afrique/en-erythree-l-humour-est-la-politesse-du-desespoir-138929|title=En Erythrée, l'humour du Awaze Tribune est la politesse du désespoir|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=TV5MONDE|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several instances of interaction between '''[[Buddhism]] and the [[Roman Empire|Roman world]]''' are documented by [[Classics|Classical]] and early [[Christianity|Christian]] writers.

==Pandion embassy==
[[File:Statuetta indiana di Lakshmi, avorio, da pompei, 1-50 dc ca., 149425, 02.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Pompeii Lakshmi]] [[ivory carving|ivory statuette]], found in 1938 in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] (destroyed in 79 CE), is thought to have originated in [[Bhokardan]], [[Satavahana Empire]] . It testifies to the intensity of [[Indo-Roman trade relations]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;State Intervention and Popular Response: Western India in the Nineteenth Century, Mariam Dossal, Ruby Maloni, Popular Prakashan, 1999, p.46  [https://books.google.com/books?id=t7f0JEWk6HMC&amp;pg=PA46]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{further|Indo-Roman relations}}
Roman historical accounts describe an embassy sent by the "[[India]]n king Porus (Pandion (?) [[Pandya]] (?) or [[Pandita (Buddhism)|Pandita]] (?) {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}) to [[Caesar Augustus]] sometime between 22 BC and 13 AD. The embassy was travelling with a diplomatic letter on a skin in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], and one of its members was a [[sramana]] who [[Self-immolation|burned himself alive]] in [[Athens]] to demonstrate his faith. The event made a sensation and was described by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], who met the embassy at [[Antioch]] (near present day [[Antakya]] in [[Turkey]]) and related by [[Strabo]] (XV,1,73 {{ref|Strabo}}) and [[Dio Cassius]] (liv, 9). A tomb was made to the sramana, still visible in the time of [[Plutarch]], which bore the mention:

{{quote|"ΖΑΡΜΑΝΟΧΗΓΑΣ ΙΝΔΟΣ ΑΠΟ ΒΑΡΓΟΣΗΣ"
&lt;br /&gt;("[[Zarmanochegas]] from [[Bharuch|Barygaza]] in [[India]]")}}

[[Strabo]] also states that [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] in giving the details of his tomb inscription specified his name was "[[Zarmanochegas]]" and he "immortalized himself according to the custom of his country." [[Cassius Dio]] (''Hist'' 54.9) and [[Plutarch]] cite the same story&lt;ref&gt;Elledge CD. Life After Death in Early Judaism. Mohr Siebeck Tilbringen 2006 {{ISBN|3-16-148875-X}} pp122-125&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Eliot (diplomat)|Charles Eliot]] in his ''Hinduism and Buddhism: An Historical Sketch (1921)'' considers that the name Zarmanochegas "perhaps contains the two words [[Sramana]] and [[Acarya]]."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Eliot. Hinduism and Buddhism: An Historical Sketch vol 1. Curzon Press, Richmond 1990. {{ISBN|0-7007-0679-8}} p 431 fn 4.&lt;/ref&gt; HL Jones' translation of the inscription as mentioned by Strabo reads it as "The Sramana master, an Indian, a native of Bargosa, having immortalized himself according to the custom of his country, lies here."&lt;ref&gt;Elledge CD. Life After Death in Early Judaism. Mohr Siebeck Tilbringen 2006 {{ISBN|3-16-148875-X}} p125&lt;/ref&gt;
These accounts at least indicate that Indian religious men (Sramanas, to which the Buddhists belonged, as opposed to [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Brahmin|Brahmanas]]) were circulating in the [[Levant]] during the time of [[Jesus]].

==Buddhist culture and pre-Christian Greece==
{{Further|History of Buddhism|Greco-Buddhism}}
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|right|thumb|230px|From the time of Jesus or soon after: a statue of Siddartha Gautama preaching, in the Greco-Buddhist style of [[Gandhara]], present-day Pakistan]]

By the time of Jesus, the teachings of the Buddha had already spread through much of [[Buddhism in India|India]] and penetrated into [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asia]] and [[Buddhism in China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth Scott |last=Latourette |title=A History of Christianity |year=1975}} p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; They display certain similarities to Christian [[morality|moral]] precepts of more than five centuries later; the sanctity of life, [[compassion]] for others, [[ahimsa|rejection of violence]], [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and emphasis on [[Charity (practice)|charity]] and the practice of [[virtue]].

[[Will Durant]], noting that the [[Ashoka the Great|Emperor Ashoka]] sent [[missionary|missionaries]], not only to elsewhere in India and to Sri Lanka, but to [[ancient Syria|Syria]], [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[ancient Greece|Greece]], speculated in the 1930s that they may have helped prepare the ground for Christian teaching.&lt;ref&gt;1. Will Durant, The Story of Civilization: Our Oriental Heritage, Part One (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1935), vol. 1, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mauryan proselytizing==
{{See also|Greco-Buddhist monasticism}}

Ashoka ascended the throne of India around 270 BC. After his conversion to Buddhism he dispatched missionaries to the four points of the compass. Archeological finds indicate these missions had been "favorably received" in lands to the West.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], one of the monarchs Ashoka mentions in his edicts, is recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] as having sent an ambassador named [[Dionysius (ambassador)|Dionysius]] to the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan]] court at [[Pataliputra]]: "India has been treated of by several other Greek writers who resided at the courts of Indian kings, such, for instance, as Megasthenes, and by Dionysius, who was sent thither by Philadelphus, expressly for the purpose: all of whom have enlarged upon the power and vast resources of these nations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+6.21 Pliny the Elder, "The Natural History", Chap. 21] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728023626/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+6.21 |date=2013-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Records from [[Alexandria]], long a crossroads of commerce and ideas, indicate that itinerant monks from the Indian subcontinent may have influenced philosophical currents of the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Roman accounts centuries later speak of monks traveling to the middle east, and there is mention of an embassy sent by the Indian king Pandion, or Porus (possibly [[Pandya]]), to [[Caesar Augustus]] around 13 AD (see ''Pandion Embassy'' section above).

==Expansion of Buddhist culture westward==
{{Main|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
Meanwhile, the Buddha's teachings had spread north-west, into [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] territory. Buddhist [[stupa]] remains have been identified as distant as the [[Silk Road]] city of [[Merv]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Silk Road city of Marv (Grk. Margiana), situated in the eastern part of the Parthian Empire, became a major Buddhist center" Foltz, "Religions of the Silk Road", p47&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet archeological teams in [[Giaur Kala]], near Merv, have uncovered  a Buddhist monastery, complete with huge [[buddharupa]]. Parthian nobles such as [[An Shih Kao]] are known to have adopted Buddhism and were among those responsible for its further spread towards [[Han China]].

==Western knowledge of Buddhism==

[[File:SiddhartaBirth.jpg|thumb|300px|The birth of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], [[Gandhara]], 2nd–3rd century AD.]]
Some knowledge of Buddhism existed quite early in the West. In the 2nd century AD [[Clement of Alexandria]] wrote about the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]:{{ref|Clement2}}

{{quote|{{lang|grc|εἰσὶ δὲ τῶν Ἰνδῶν οἱ τοῖς Βούττα πειθόμενοι παραγγέλμασιν. ὃν δι’ ὑπερβολὴν σεμνότητος ὡς θεὸν τετιμήκασι.}} [Among the Indians are those philosophers also who follow the precepts of Boutta, whom they honour as a god on account of his extraordinary sanctity.]| [[Clement of Alexandria]]|''[[Stromata]]'' (''Miscellanies''), Book I, Chapter XV}}

He also recognized Bactrian Buddhists (Sramanas) and Indian [[Gymnosophists]] for their influence on Greek thought:{{ref|Clement}}

{{quote|"Thus philosophy, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity among the barbarians, shedding its light over the nations. And afterwards it came to [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. First in its ranks were the prophets of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]; and the [[Chaldea]]ns among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]; and the [[Druids]] among the [[Gauls]]; and the '''Sramanas''' among the [[Bactrians]] ("Σαρμαναίοι Βάκτρων"); and the philosophers of the [[Celts]]; and the [[Magi]] of the [[Persia]]ns, who foretold the Saviour's birth, and came into the land of [[Judea|Judaea]] guided by a [[Star of Bethlehem|star]]. The Indian gymnosophists are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called '''Sramanas''' ("Σαρμάναι"), and others [[Brahmins]] ("Βραχμάναι")." | [[Clement of Alexandria]]|''[[Stromata]]'' (''Miscellanies'')}}

The story of [[Queen Maya|the birth of the Buddha]] was also known: a fragment of Archelaos of Carrha (278 AD) mentions the Buddha's virgin-birth, and [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] (4th century) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says "was born from the side of a virgin". [[Queen Maya]] came to bear the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] after receiving a prophetic dream in which she foresaw the descent of the Bodhisattva (Buddha-to-be) from the [[Tushita|Tuṣita]] heaven into her womb. This story has some parallels with the story of Jesus being conceived in connection with the visitation of the [[Holy Spirit]] to the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].

==Buddhism and Gnosticism==
{{Main|Buddhism and Gnosticism}}
Early 3rd century–4th century [[Christian]] writers such as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] write about a [[Scythianus]], who visited India around 50 AD from where he brought "the doctrine of the Two Principles". According to [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], Scythianus' pupil [[Terebinthus]] presented himself as a "Buddha" ("He called himself Buddas" {{ref|Tere}}). Terebinthus went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Judea|Judaea]] ("becoming known and condemned"), and ultimately settled in [[Babylon]], where he transmitted his teachings to [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], thereby creating the foundation of [[Manichaeism]]:

{{quote|"But Terebinthus, his disciple in this wicked error, inherited his money and books and heresy, and came to Palestine, and becoming known and condemned in Judæa he resolved to pass into Persia: but lest he should be recognised there also by his name he changed it and called himself Buddas."|[[Cyril of Jerusalem]], [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310106.htm "Catechetical lecture 6"]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1594">'''Burtas''' ({{lang-ru|Буртасы}}, ''Burtasy''; {{lang-cv|Пăртассем}}, ''Părtassem''; {{lang-tt|Бортаслар|Bortaslar|برطاسلر or بۇرتاسلار}}) were a tribe of uncertain ethnolinguistic affiliation inhabiting the [[steppe]] region north of the [[Caspian Sea]] in medieval times (modern [[Penza Oblast]], [[Ulyanovsk Oblast]] and [[Saratov Oblast]] of the [[Russia| Russian Federation]]). They were subject to the [[Khazars]].

The ethnic identity of the Burtas is disputed, with several different theories ranging from them being a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] tribal confederacy (probably later assimilated to Turkic language), and therefore perhaps the ancestors of the modern [[Mokshas|Moksha people]], or that they were an [[Iranic]] tribe, possibly the ancestors of the modern [[Mishars]].

Recently, some scholars have suggested that the Burtas were actually [[Alans]] or another [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] ethnolinguistic group. The Alanic ([[Sarmatian]]) origin is also derived from their name furt/fort (big river on [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian language]])  and [[Alans|''as'']] is Alanic selfname, as [[Ossetians]] (Caucasian [[Alans]]) and [[Jassic people|Jasses]] ([[Jasz people|Jasz]], Hungarian [[Alans]]) all used the same name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1842">The '''Christian Maramatanga Society''' is a small Christian-based denomination originating in New Zealand in mid-1920s.

== History ==

Following a theological debate in the Rātana Established Church of New Zealand, Mrs. Ngapaki Hakaraia left the church to form her own movement at [[Kai Iwi]], a settlement in New Zealand to the west of [[Wanganui]]. It is said that when Mr. [[Tahupotiki Wiremu Rātana]], Mangai, founder of the Rātana Established Church of New Zealand (commonly known as [[Rātana Church]]) "closed the Bible", many thought that he implied that the members of the church should not read the [[Bible]] as well. This influenced Mrs. Hakaraia into forming her own church to ensure that the Bible "remained open". However, Rātana did not imply this but rather that the Bible be closed in order to stop fanciful prophecies being heralded from the Book of Revelation in the future.

Following the Rātana church, the Society actively engaged in politics.

== Today ==

The church continues today with a small membership.{{cn|date=August 2011}}

{{Expand German|Kontinentalgermanische Mythologie|date=September 2011}}
'''Continental Germanic mythology''' is a subtype of [[Germanic paganism]] as practiced in parts of [[Central Europe]] during the 6th to 8th centuries, a period of [[Germanic Christianity|Christianization]]. It continued in the [[legend]]s, and [[Middle High German]] epics of the [[Middle Ages]]. Traces of these stories, with the [[sacred]] elements largely removed, may be found throughout [[European folklore]] and [[fairy tale]]s.

==Tribes==
The mythologies of the following tribes are included in this category:
*[[Lombards]] (source: [[Paulus Diaconus]])
*[[Alamanni]] (see: [[Nordendorf fibula]], [[Pforzen buckle]])
*[[Franks]] and [[Thuringii]] (see: [[Frankish mythology]], [[Donar's Oak]])
*[[Saxons]] (see: [[Irminsul]])
*[[Frisians]] (source: Life of [[Saint Willibrord]])

==Paganism==
Compared to [[Norse mythology|North Germanic]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Anglo-Saxon mythology]], examples of Continental Germanic [[paganism]] are extremely fragmentary. Besides a handful of brief [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions the lone, genuinely pagan Continental Germanic documents are the short [[Old High German]] [[Merseburg Incantations]]. However, pagan mythological elements were preserved in later literature, notably in Middle High German epic poetry, but also in [[German folklore|German]], [[Swiss folklore|Swiss]], and [[Dutch folklore]].

{{Anthropology |theories}}

'''Cross-cultural studies''', sometimes called '''holocultural studies''' or '''comparative studies''', is a specialization in [[anthropology]] and sister sciences ([[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[political science]]) that uses field data from many [[Society|societies]] to examine the scope of [[human behavior]] and test hypotheses about human behavior and culture. Cross-cultural studies is the third form of cross-cultural comparisons. The first is comparison of case studies, the second is controlled comparison among variants of a common derivation,{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} and the third is comparison within a sample of cases. Unlike comparative studies, which examines similar characteristics of a few societies, cross-cultural studies uses a sufficiently large sample so that statistical analysis can be made to show relationships or lack of relationships between the traits in question. These studies are surveys of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] data.

Cross-cultural studies are applied widely in the [[social science]]s, particularly in [[cultural anthropology]] and [[psychology]].

==History==
The first cross-cultural studies were carried out by 19th-century anthropologists such as [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and [[Lewis H. Morgan]]. One of Edward Tylor's first studies gave rise to the central statistical issue of cross-cultural studies: [[Galton's problem]]. In the recent decades historians and particularly historians of science started looking at the mechanism and networks by which knowledge, ideas, skills, instruments and books moved across cultures, generating new and fresh concepts concerning the order of things in nature. In ''Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges in the Eastern Mediterranean 1560–1660'' Avner Ben-Zaken has argued that cross-cultural exchanges take place at a cultural hazy locus where the margins of one culture overlaps the other, creating a "mutually embraced zone" where exchanges take place on mundane ways. From such a stimulating zone, ideas, styles, instruments and practices move onward to the cultural centers, urging them to renew and update cultural notions.&lt;ref&gt;Avner Ben-Zaken, "From "Incommensurability of Cultures" to Mutually Embraced Zones" in ''Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges In the Eastern Mediterranean 1560-1660'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010)], pp. 163-167. {{ISBN|9780801894763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era of cross-cultural studies==

The modern era of cross-cultural studies began with [[George Murdock]] (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Whiting (1986:305)&lt;/ref&gt; Murdock set up a number of foundational data sets, including the [[Human Relations Area Files]], and the ''Ethnographic Atlas.'' Together with [[Douglas R. White]], he developed the widely used [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]], currently maintained by the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] electronic journal [[World Cultures]].

In [[linguistics]], '''ductus''' is the qualities and characteristics of [[speech|speaking]] or [[handwriting|writing]] instantiated in the act of speaking or the flow of writing the text. For instance, in writing, ductus includes the direction, sequencing, and speed with which the strokes making up a character are drawn.

Unlike [[rhythm]], ductus is the performative quality that emerges by actuating the metrically arranged language in voice. It is then the specific style and character of the language as it exists within time. While rhythm is tied to tempo, ductus picks up various features of performative language, such as pitch and tone as well.

It is for example possible to recognize people by their ductus.

[[Image:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|Roman [[Epicurus]] bust]]
'''Epicureanism''' is a system of [[philosophy]] based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]], founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an [[atomism|atomic]] [[materialism|materialist]], following in the steps of [[Democritus]]. His materialism led him to a [[Religious skepticism|general attack on superstition and divine intervention]]. Following [[Aristippus]]—about whom very little is known—Epicurus believed that what he called "pleasure" (ἡδονή) was the greatest good, but that the way to attain such pleasure was to live modestly, to gain knowledge of the workings of the world, and to limit one's desires. This would lead one to attain a state of tranquility (''[[ataraxia]]'') and freedom from fear as well as an absence of bodily pain (''[[aponia]]''). The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of [[hedonism]] insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from "hedonism" as [[colloquially]] understood.

Epicureanism was originally a challenge to [[Platonism]], though later it became the main opponent of [[Stoicism]]. Epicurus and his followers shunned politics. After the death of Epicurus, his school was headed by [[Hermarchus]]; later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era (such as those in [[Antioch]]ia, [[Alexandria]], [[Rhodes]], and [[Ercolano]]). Its best-known Roman proponent was the poet [[Lucretius]]. By the end of the Roman Empire, being opposed by philosophies (mainly Neo-Platonism) that were now in the ascendant, Epicureanism had all but died out, and would be resurrected in the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

Some writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' by Lucretius to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the scrolls unearthed at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]] are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean [[Philodemus]].

==History==
In [[Mytilene]], the capital of the island [[Lesbos]], and then in [[Lampsacus]], [[Epicurus]] taught and gained followers. In [[Athens]], Epicurus bought a property for his school called "Garden", later the name of Epicurus' school.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Konstan|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/|title=Epicurus|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members included [[Hermarchus]], [[Idomeneus of Lampsacus|Idomeneus]], [[Colotes]], [[Polyaenus of Lampsacus|Polyaenus]], and [[Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger)|Metrodorus]]. Epicurus emphasized friendship as an important ingredient of happiness, and the school seems to have been a moderately ascetic community which rejected the political limelight of Athenian philosophy. They were fairly [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] by Athenian standards, including women and slaves. Some members were also [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]] as, from slender evidence, Epicurus did not eat meat, although no prohibition against eating meat was made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/2010/08/the-hidden-history-of-greco-roman-vegetarianism/ The Hidden History of Greco-Roman Vegetarianism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dombrowski|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Dombrowski|title=The Philosophy of Vegetarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSLoTGecabsC&amp;pg=PA81|year=1984|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-0-87023-431-6|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's popularity grew and it became, along with [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]], [[Peripatetic school|Peripateticism]], and [[Pyrrhonism]], one of the dominant schools of [[Hellenistic philosophy]], lasting strongly through the later [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacGillivray|first1=Erlend D|title=The Popularity of Epicureanism in Late-Republic Roman Society. The Ancient World, XLIII (2012) pp. 151–172.|journal=The Ancient World|date=2012|volume=XLIII|page=151-172|url=https://www.academia.edu/3333818/The_Popularity_of_Epicureanism_in_Late-Republic_Roman_Society._The_Ancient_World_XLIII_2012_pp.151-172|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major source of information is the Roman politician and philosopher [[Cicero]], although he was highly critical, denouncing the Epicureans as unbridled [[hedonism|hedonists]], devoid of a sense of [[virtue]] and duty, and guilty of withdrawing from public life. Another ancient source is [[Diogenes of Oenoanda]], who composed a large inscription at [[Oenoanda]] in [[Lycia]]. 

Deciphered carbonized [[scroll]]s obtained from the library at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]] contain a large number of works by [[Philodemus]], a late Hellenistic Epicurean, and Epicurus himself, attesting to the school's enduring popularity. [[Diogenes Laërtius|Diogenes]] reports slanderous stories, circulated by Epicurus' opponents.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt; With growing dominance of [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Peripateticism]], and later, [[Christianity]], Epicureanism declined. By the late third century CE, there was little trace of its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Frede|title=Epilogue|publisher=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy|pages=795–96|year=1999|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/the-cambridge-history-of-hellenistic-philosophy/epilogue/360761D427CCAD70EA98919BEA3C4F67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Christian writer [[Lactantius]] criticizes Epicurus at several points throughout his ''Divine Institutes''. In [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', the Epicureans are depicted as [[Heresy|heretics]] suffering in the [[Inferno (Dante)#Sixth Circle|sixth circle of hell]]. In fact, Epicurus appears to represent the ultimate heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Trans. Robert Pinsky, The Inferno of Dante, p. 320 n. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The word for a heretic in the [[Talmud]]ic literature is "Apiqoros" ({{hebrew|אפיקורוס}}).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the 17th century, the French Franciscan priest, scientist and philosopher [[Pierre Gassendi]] wrote two books forcefully reviving Epicureanism. Shortly thereafter, and clearly influenced by Gassendi, [[Walter Charleton]] published several works on Epicureanism in English. Attacks by Christians continued, most forcefully by the [[Cambridge Platonists]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the [[early modern period]], scientists adopted [[atomism|atomist]] theories, while [[materialism|materialist]] philosophers embraced Epicurus' hedonist ethics and restated his objections to natural [[teleology]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Religion==
Epicureanism does not deny the existence of the gods; rather it denies their involvement in the world. According to Epicureanism, the gods do not interfere with human lives or the rest of the universe in any way.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=155-156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manner in which the Epicurean gods exist is still disputed. Some scholars say that Epicureanism believes that the gods exist outside the mind as material objects (the realist position), while others assert that the gods only exist in our minds as ideals (the idealist position).&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicurus and the Epicurean Tradition|last=Sedley|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Fish|editor-first=Jeffrey|location=United Kingdom|pages=29-30|chapter=Epicurus' theological innatism|editor-last2=Sanders|editor-first2=Kirk R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicurus and the Epicurean Tradition|last=Konstan|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Fish|editor-first=Jeffrey|location=United Kingdom|pages=53-54|chapter=Epicurus on the gods|editor-last2=Sanders|editor-first2=Kirk R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realist position holds that Epicureans understand the gods as existing as physical and immortal beings made of atoms that reside somewhere in reality.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; However, the gods are completely separate from the rest of reality; they are uninterested in it, play no role in it, and remain completely undisturbed by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mansfeld|first=Jaap|date=1993|title=Aspects of Epicurean Theology|url=|journal=Mnemosyne|volume=vol. 46, no. 2|pages=176-178|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the gods live in what is called the ''[[metakosmia]]'', or the space between worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Readings in Classical Studies: Lucretius|last=Buchheit|first=Vinzenz|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Gale|editor-first=Monica R.|location=New York, NY|pages=110-111|chapter=Epicurus' Triumph of the Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, the idealist position holds that Epicurus did not actually conceive of the gods as existing in reality. Rather, Epicurus is said to have viewed the gods as just idealized forms of the best human life,&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=158-159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is thought that the gods were emblematic of the life one should aspire towards.&lt;ref name=":1022"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicurus and the Epicurean Tradition|last=Sedley|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Fish|editor-first=Jeffrey|location=United Kingdom|pages=29-30|chapter=Epicurus' theological innatism|editor-last2=Sanders|editor-first2=Kirk R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate between these two positions was revived by A. A. Long and David Sedley in their 1987 book, ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'', in which the two argued in favor of the idealist position.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; While a scholarly consensus has yet to be reached, the realist position remains the prevailing viewpoint at this time.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

Epicureanism also offered arguments against the existence of the gods in the manner proposed by other belief systems. The ''Riddle of Epicurus'', or ''[[Problem of evil]]'', is a famous argument against the existence of an all-powerful and providential God or gods. As recorded by [[Lactantius]]:

{{quote|God either wants to eliminate bad things and cannot, or can but does not want to, or neither wishes to nor can, or both wants to and can. If he wants to and cannot, then he is weak – and this does not apply to god. If he can but does not want to, then he is spiteful – which is equally foreign to god's nature. If he neither wants to nor can, he is both weak and spiteful, and so not a god. If he wants to and can, which is the only thing fitting for a god, where then do bad things come from? Or why does he not eliminate them?|Lactantius|De Ira Deorum&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Ira Deorum'', 13.19 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150912180840/http://www.epicurus.info/etexts/epicurea.html Epicurus, Frag. 374, Usener]). [[David Hume]] paraphrased this passage in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'': "EPICURUS's old questions are yet unanswered. Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This type of ''[[trilemma]]'' argument (God is omnipotent, God is good, but Evil exists) was one favoured by the ancient Greek [[philosophical skepticism|skeptics]], and this argument may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his [[Christian]] perspective, regarded Epicurus as an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name="larrimore"&gt;Mark Joseph Larrimore, (2001), ''The Problem of Evil'', pp. xix–xxi. Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Reinhold F. Glei]], it is settled that the argument of theodicy is from an academical source which is not only not Epicurean, but even anti-Epicurean.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold F. Glei, ''Et invidus et inbecillus. Das angebliche Epikurfragment bei Laktanz, De ira dei 13, 20–21'', in: ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 42 (1988), pp. 47–58&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest extant version of this ''trilemma'' appears in the writings of the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]].&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', 175: "those who firmly maintain that god exists will be forced into impiety; for if they say that he [god] takes care of everything, they will be saying that god is the cause of evils, while if they say that he takes care of some things only or even nothing, they will be forced to say that he is either malevolent or weak"&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallels may be drawn to [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], which similarly emphasize a lack of divine interference and aspects of its [[atomism]]. Epicureanism also resembles Buddhism in its temperateness, including the belief that great excess leads to great dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scharfstein |first1=Ben-Ami |title=A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant |date=1998 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=9780791436837 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZQy2lu70bwC&amp;pg=PA202 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=David E. |last2=James |first2=Simon P. |title=Buddhism, Virtue and Environment |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781351954310 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AD4rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clayman33"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ceLUAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33 Berenice II and the Golden Age of Ptolemaic Egypt, Dee L.

==Philosophy==
{{Hedonism}}Epicureanism argued that [[pleasure]] was the chief good in life.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest amount of pleasure possible during one's lifetime, yet doing so moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in such pleasure.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than on physical pleasures.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=107-115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unnecessary and, especially, artificially produced desires were to be suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=125-127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the political life could give rise to desires that could disturb virtue and one's peace of mind, such as a lust for power or a desire for fame, participation in politics was discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism: A Very Brief Introduction|last=Wilson|first=Catherine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=84-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Epicurus sought to eliminate the fear of the gods and of death, seeing those two fears as chief causes of strife in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=155-171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epicurus actively recommended against passionate love, and believed it best to avoid marriage altogether. He viewed recreational sex as a natural, but not necessary desire that should be generally avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism: A Very Short Introduction|last=Wilson|first=Catherine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=95-96}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Epicurean understanding of justice was inherently self-interested. Justice was deemed good because it was seen as mutually beneficial.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=139-140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals would not act unjustly even if the act was initially unnoticed because of possibly being caught and punished.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=142-145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both punishment and fear of punishment would cause a person disturbance and prevent them from being happy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

Epicurus laid great emphasis on developing friendships as the basis of a satisfying life.

{{quote|of all the things which wisdom has contrived which contribute to a blessed life, none is more important, more fruitful, than friendship|quoted by Cicero&lt;ref&gt;''On Goals'', 1.65&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the pursuit of pleasure formed the focal point of the philosophy, this was largely directed to the "static pleasures" of minimizing pain, anxiety and suffering. In fact, Epicurus referred to life as a "bitter gift".

{{quote|When we say . . . that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do by some through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.|Epicurus|''"Letter to Menoeceus"''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Epicurus, "Letter to Menoeceus", contained in Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', Book X&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Epicureanism rejects immortality. It believes in the soul, but suggests that the soul is mortal and material, just like the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism: A Very Brief Introduction|last=Wilson|first=Catherine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epicurus rejected any possibility of an afterlife, while still contending that one need not fear death: "Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''A History of Western Philosophy''], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+History+of+Western+Philosophy#PPA239,M1 pp. 239–40]&lt;/ref&gt; From this doctrine arose the Epicurean Epitaph: ''Non fui, fui, non sum, non curo'' ("I was not; I was; I am not; I do not care"), which is inscribed on the gravestones of his followers and seen on many ancient gravestones of the [[Roman Empire]]. This quotation is often used today at [[humanism|humanist]] funerals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanism.org.uk/humanism/humanist-tradition/ancient-world/epicurus ''Epicurus (c 341–270 BC)''] [[British Humanist Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
Epicureanism bases its ethics on a hedonistic set of values. In the most basic sense, Epicureans see pleasure as the purpose of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics: An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy|last=Sharples|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence for this, Epicureans say that nature seems to command us to avoid pain, and they point out that all animals try to avoid pain as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism: A Very Short Introduction|last=Wilson|first=Catherine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epicureans had a very specific understanding of what the greatest pleasure was, and the focus of their ethics was on the avoidance of pain rather than seeking out pleasure.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Epicureanism divided pleasure into two broad categories: ''pleasures of the body'' and ''pleasures of the mind''.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=117-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Pleasures of the body'': These pleasures involve sensations of the body, such as the act of eating delicious food or of being in a state of comfort free from pain, and exist only the present.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; One can only experience pleasures of the body in the moment, meaning they only exist as a person is experiencing them.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=118-119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Pleasures of the mind'': These pleasures involve mental processes and states; feelings of joy, the lack of fear, and pleasant memories are all examples of pleasures of the mind.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These pleasures of the mind do not only exist in the present, but also in the past and future, since memory of a past pleasant experience or the expectation of some potentially pleasing future can both be pleasurable experiences.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Because of this, the pleasures of the mind are considered to be greater than those of the body.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
The Epicureans further divided each of these types of pleasures into two categories: ''kinetic pleasure'' and ''[[katastematic pleasure]]''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=119-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Kinetic pleasure'': Kinetic pleasure describes the physical or mental pleasures that involve action or change.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics: An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy|last=Sharples|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=91-92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eating delicious food, as well as fulfilling desires and removing pain, which is itself considered a pleasurable act, are all examples of kinetic pleasure in the physical sense.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicurus and Democritean Ethics: An Archaeology of Ataraxia|last=Warren|first=James|publisher=University of Cambridge|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Epicurus, feelings of joy would be an example of mental kinetic pleasure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* ''Katastematic pleasure'': Katastematic pleasure describes the pleasure one feels while in a state without pain.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Like kinetic pleasures, katastematic pleasures can also be physical, such as the state of not being thirsty, or mental, such as freedom from a state of fear.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Complete physical katastematic pleasure is called ''[[aponia]]'', and complete mental katastematic pleasure is called ''[[ataraxia]]''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
From this understanding, Epicureans concluded that the greatest pleasure a person could reach was the complete removal of all pain, both physical and mental.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal then of Epicurean ethics was to reach a state of ''aponia'' and ''ataraxia''.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; In order to do this an Epicurean had to control their desires, because desire itself was seen as painful.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Not only will controlling one's desires bring about ''aponia'', as one will rarely suffer from not being physically satisfied, but controlling one's desires will also help to bring about ''ataraxia'' because one will not be anxious about becoming discomforted since one would have so few desires anyway.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Epicurus distinguishes three kinds of desires: the natural and necessary, the natural but not necessary, and those that are neither natural or necessary.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=124-125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Natural and necessary'': These desires are limited desires that are innately present in all humans; it is part of human nature to have them.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; They are necessary for one of three reasons: necessary for happiness, necessary for freedom from bodily discomfort, and necessary for life.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Clothing would belong to the first two categories, while something like food would belong to the third.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* ''Natural but not necessary'': These desires are innate to humans, but they do not need to be fulfilled for their happiness or their survival.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=126-127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting to eat delicious food when one is hungry is an example of a natural but not necessary desire.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The main problem with these desires is that they fail to substantially increase a person's happiness, and at the same time require effort to obtain and are desired by people due to false beliefs that they are actually necessary.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; It is for this reason that they should be avoided.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;
* ''Not natural nor necessary'': These desires are neither innate to humans nor required for happiness or health; indeed, they are also limitless and can never be fulfilled.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=125-126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desires of wealth or fame would fall under this category, and such desires are to be avoided because they will ultimately only bring about discomfort.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;
If one follows only natural and necessary desires, then, according to Epicurus, one would be able to reach ''aponia'' and ''ataraxia'' and thereby the highest form of happiness.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Epicurus was also an early thinker to develop the notion of justice as a social contract. He defined justice as an agreement made by people not to harm each other.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The point of living in a society with laws and punishments is to be protected from harm so that one is free to pursue happiness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of this, laws that do not contribute to promoting human happiness are not just.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He gave his own unique version of the [[ethic of reciprocity]], which differs from other formulations by emphasizing minimizing harm and maximizing happiness for oneself and others:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly, and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living a pleasant life."&lt;ref name=classics&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Epicurus/princdoc.html |title=Epicurus Principal Doctrines 5 and 31 transl. by Robert Drew Hicks |publisher= |date=1925 |accessdate= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:("justly" meaning to prevent a "person from harming or being harmed by another")&lt;ref name=classics/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Epicureanism incorporated a relatively full account of the [[social contract]] theory, and in part attempts to address issues with the society described in [[Plato]]'s ''Republic''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=139-142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social contract theory established by Epicureanism is based on mutual agreement, not divine decree.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Epicurean physics==
Epicurean physics held that the entire universe consisted of two things: matter and void.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matter is made up of atoms, which are tiny bodies that have only the unchanging qualities of shape, size, and weight.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism: A Very Short Introduction|last=Wilson|first=Catherine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atoms were felt to be unchanging because the Epicureans believed that the world was ordered and that changes had to have specific and consistent sources, e.g. a plant species only grows from a seed of the same species.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics: An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy|last=Sharples|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=34-35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epicurus holds that there must be an infinite supply of atoms, although only a finite number of types of atoms, as well as an infinite amount of void.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Epicurus explains this position in his letter to Herodotus:&lt;blockquote&gt;“Moreover, the sum of things is unlimited both by reason of the multitude of the atoms and the extent of the void. For if the void were infinite and bodies finite, the bodies would not have stayed anywhere but would have been dispersed in their course through the infinite void, not having any supports or counterchecks to send them back on their upward rebound. Again, if the void were finite, the infinity of bodies would not have anywhere to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/diogenes_laertius-lives_eminent_philosophers_book_x_epicurus/1925/pb_LCL185.573.xml|title=Lives of Eminent Philosophers: Volume II: Books 6-10|last=Diogenes|first=Laertius|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1925|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=573-575|translator-last=Hicks|translator-first=R. D.|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Because of the infinite supply of atoms, there are an infinite amount of worlds, or ''cosmoi''.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Some of these worlds could be vastly different than our own, some quite similar, and all of the worlds were separated from each other by vast areas of void (''[[metakosmia]]'').&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

Epicureanism states that atoms are unable to be broken down into any smaller parts, and Epicureans offered multiple arguments to support this position.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics: An introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy|last=Sharples|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=35-37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epicureans argue that because void is necessary for matter to move, anything which consists of both void and matter can be broken down, while if something contains no void then it has no way to break apart because no part of the substance could be broken down into a smaller subsection of the substance.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=18-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also argued that in order for the universe to persist, what it is ultimately made up of must not be able to be changed or else the universe would be essentially destroyed.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Atoms are constantly moving in one of four different ways.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism: A Very Short Introduction|last=Wilson|first=Catherine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atoms can simply collide with each other and then bounce off of each other.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; When joined with each other and forming a larger object, atoms can vibrate as they into each other while still maintaining the overall shape of the larger object.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; When not prevented by other atoms, all atoms move at the same speed naturally downwards in relation to the rest world.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=25-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This downwards motion is natural for atoms; however, as their fourth means of motion, atoms can at times randomly swerve out of their usual downwards path.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; This swerving motion is what allowed for the creation of the universe, since as more and more atoms swerved and collided with each other, objects were able to take shape as the atoms joined together. Without the swerve, the atoms would never have interacted with each other, and simply continued to move downwards at the same speed.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

Epicurus also felt that the swerve was what accounted for humanity's free will.&lt;ref name=":222"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoics, Epicurus, and Sceptics: An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy|last=Sharples|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=64-66}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it were not for the swerve, humans would be subject to a never-ending chain of cause and effect.&lt;ref name=":222" /&gt; This was a point which Epicureans often used to criticize [[Democritus]]' [[Democritean theory of atoms|atomic theory]].&lt;ref name=":222" /&gt;

Epicureans believed that senses also relied on atoms. Every object was continually emitting particles from itself that would then interact with the observer.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism: A Very Short Introduction|last=Wilson|first=Catherine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=54-55}}&lt;/ref&gt; All sensations, such as sight, smell, or sound, relied on these particles.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; While the atoms that were emitted did not have the qualities that the senses were perceiving, the manner in which they were emitted caused the observer to experience those sensations, e.g. red particles were not themselves red but  were emitted in a manner that caused the viewer to experience the color red.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The atoms are not perceived individually, but rather as a continuous sensation because of how quickly they move.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

==Epistemology==
Epicurean philosophy employs an [[Empiricism|empirical]] epistemology.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Epicureans believed that all sense perceptions were true,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Epicureanism|last=Asmis|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Warren|editor-first=James|location=|pages=84|chapter=Epicurean empiricism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Pres|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=97-98}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that errors arise in how we judge those perceptions.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; When we form judgments about things (''hupolepsis''), they can be verified and corrected through further sensory information.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Greek Philosophy: From Thales to the Stoics Analysis and Fragments|last=Bakalis|first=Nikolaos|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2005|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=193-197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicurus and the Epicurean Tradition|last=Konstan|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Fish|editor-first=Jeffrey|location=Cambridge|pages=62-63|editor-last2=Sanders|editor-first2=Kirk R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=103-104}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if someone sees a tower from far away that appears to be round, and upon approaching the tower they see that it is actually square, they would come to realize that their original judgement was wrong and correct their wrong opinion.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Epicurus is said to have proposed three criteria of [[truth]]: sensations (''aisthêsis''), preconceptions (''prolepsis''), and feelings (''pathê'').&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics|last=Sharples|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth criterion called "presentational applications of the mind" (''phantastikai epibolai tês dianoias'') was said to have been added by later Epicureans.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Epicureanism|last=Asmis|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Warren|editor-first=James|location=Cambridge|pages=93-94|chapter=Epicurean empiricism}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria formed the method through which Epicureans thought we gained knowledge.&lt;ref name=":242"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Epicureans thought that sensations could not deceive, sensations are the first and main criterion of truth for Epicureans.&lt;ref name=":252"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Pres|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=97-98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in cases where sensory input seems to mislead, the input itself is true and the error arises from our judgments about the input. For example, when one places a straight oar in the water, it appears bent. The Epicurean would argue that image of the oar, that is the atoms traveling from the oar to the observer's eyes, have been shifted and thus really do arrive at the observer's eyes in the shape of a bent oar.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics: An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy|last=Sharples|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The observer makes the error in assuming that the image he or she receives correctly represents the oar and has not been distorted in some way.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; In order to not make erroneous judgments about perceivable things and instead verify one's judgment, Epicureans believed that one needed to obtain "clear vision" (''enargeia'') of the perceivable thing by closer examination.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics: An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy|last=Sharples|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acted as a justification for one's judgements about the thing being perceived.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; ''Enargeia'' is characterized as sensation of an object that has been unchanged by judgments or opinions and is a clear and direct perception of that object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Epicureanism|last=Asmis|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Warren|editor-first=James|location=|pages=85|chapter=Epicurean empiricism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual's preconceptions are his or her concepts of what things are, e.g. what someone's idea of a horse is, and these concepts are formed in a person's mind through sensory input over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics: An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy|last=Sharples|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=18-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the word that relates to the preconception is used, these preconceptions are summoned up by the mind into the person's thoughts.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=101-103}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is through our preconceptions that we are able to make judgments about the things that we perceive.&lt;ref name=":322"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=103-104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preconceptions were also used by Epicureans to avoid the paradox proposed by Plato in the ''[[Meno]]'' regarding learning.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; Plato argues that learning requires us to already have knowledge of what we are learning, or else we would be unable to recognize when we had successfully learned the information.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; Preconceptions, Epicureans argue, provide individuals with that pre-knowledge required for learning.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

Our feelings or emotions (''pathê'') are how we perceive pleasure and pain.&lt;ref name=":312"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Epicureanism|last=Asmis|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Warren|editor-first=James|location=Cambridge|pages=93-94|chapter=Epicurean empiricism}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are analogous to sensations in that they are a means of perception, but they perceive our internal state as opposed to external things.&lt;ref name=":312" /&gt; According to Diogenes Laertius, feelings are how we determine our actions. If something is pleasurable, we pursue that thing, and if something is painful, we avoid that thing.&lt;ref name=":312" /&gt;

The idea of "presentational applications of the mind" is an explanation for how we can discuss and inquire about things we cannot directly perceive.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsouna|first=Voula|date=2016|title=Epicurean Preconceptions|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15685284-12341304|journal=Phronesis|volume=Volume 61, Issue 2|pages=215|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; We receive impressions of such things directly in our minds, instead of perceiving them through other senses.&lt;ref name=":262"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics|last=Sharples|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "presentational applications of the mind" may have been introduced to explain how we learn about things that we cannot directly perceive, such as the gods.&lt;ref name=":262" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

==Tetrapharmakos==
{{Main|Tetrapharmakos}}
[[File:Tetrapharmakos PHerc 1005 col 5.png|thumb|Part of Herculaneum Papyrus 1005 (P.Herc.1005), col. 5. Contains Epicurean tetrapharmakos from Philodemus' Adversus Sophistas.]]
Tetrapharmakos, or "The four-part cure", is Epicurus' basic guideline as to how to live the happiest possible life. This poetic doctrine was handed down by an anonymous Epicurean who summed up Epicurus' philosophy on happiness in four simple lines:

{{quote|Don't fear god,&lt;br /&gt;Don't worry about death;&lt;br /&gt;What is good is easy to get, and&lt;br /&gt;What is terrible is easy to endure.|[[Philodemus]]|[[Herculaneum]] Papyrus, 1005, 4.9–14}}

==Notable Epicureans==
[[File:Lucretius, De rerum natura.jpg|thumb|''[[De rerum natura]]'' manuscript, copied by an Augustinian friar for Pope [[Sixtus IV]], c. 1483, after the discovery of an early manuscript in 1417 by the humanist and papal secretary [[Poggio Bracciolini]]]]
One of the earliest [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers espousing Epicureanism was [[Amafinius]]. Other adherents to the teachings of Epicurus included the poet [[Horace]], whose famous statement ''Carpe Diem'' ("Seize the Day") illustrates the philosophy, as well as [[Lucretius]], who wrote the poem ''De rerum natura'' about the tenets of the philosophy. The poet [[Virgil]] was another prominent Epicurean (see [[Lucretius]] for further details). The Epicurean philosopher [[Philodemus of Gadara]], until the 18th century only known as a poet of minor importance, rose to prominence as most of his work along with other Epicurean material was discovered in the [[Villa of the Papyri]]. In the second century CE, comedian [[Lucian of Samosata]] and wealthy promoter of philosophy [[Diogenes of Oenoanda]] were prominent Epicureans.

[[Julius Caesar]] leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, which e.g. led to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against [[Catiline]], during the [[Second Catilinarian Conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]] where he spoke out against the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Cato the Younger|Cato]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Sallust]], ''The War With Catiline'', Caesar's speech: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#51.20 51.29] &amp; Cato's reply: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#52.13 52.13]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times [[Thomas Jefferson]] referred to himself as an Epicurean:&lt;blockquote&gt;If I had time I would add to my little book the Greek, Latin and French texts, in columns side by side. And I wish I could subjoin a translation of Gassendi's Syntagma of the doctrines of Epicurus, which, notwithstanding the calumnies of the Stoics and caricatures of Cicero, is the most rational system remaining of the philosophy of the ancients, as frugal of vicious indulgence, and fruitful of virtue as the hyperbolical extravagances of his rival sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/writingsofthomas10jeffiala/writingsofthomas10jeffiala_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The writings of Thomas Jefferson;"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other modern-day Epicureans were [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[Walter Charleton]], [[François Bernier]], [[Saint-Evremond]], [[Ninon de l'Enclos]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Frances Wright]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]. 

[[Christopher Hitchens]] referred to himself as an Epicurean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.townhall.com/TalkRadio/Show.aspx?ContentGuid=dab6495c-e875-4fd1-9fa6-53809a40ef15&amp;RadioShowId=5 Townhall.com::Talk Radio Online::Radio Show&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, where perfumer/restaurateur Gérald Ghislain refers to himself as an Epicurean,&lt;ref&gt;Anon., [https://ideamensch.com/gerald-ghislain ''Gérald Ghislain – Creator of The Scent of Departure'']. IdeaMensch, July 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Onfray]] is developing a [[post-modern]] approach to Epicureanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Onfray]], ''La puissance d'exister: Manifeste hédoniste'', Grasset, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In his recent book titled ''[[The Swerve]]'', [[Stephen Greenblatt]] identified himself as strongly sympathetic to Epicureanism and Lucretius. [[Humanistic Judaism]] as a denomination also claims the Epicurean label.

== Modern usage and misconceptions ==
In modern popular usage, an Epicurean is a connoisseur of the arts of life and the refinements of sensual pleasures; ''Epicureanism'' implies a love or knowledgeable enjoyment especially of good food and drink.

Because Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good (''telos''), it has been commonly misunderstood since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in fleeting pleasures such as sexual excess and decadent food. This is not the case. Epicurus regarded ''[[ataraxia]]'' (tranquility, freedom from fear) and ''[[aponia]]'' (absence of pain) as the height of happiness. He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Instead, Epicurus preferred "the good", and "even wisdom and culture" to the "pleasure of the stomach"&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bailey, Epicurus: The Extant Remains, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1926, p.131 &lt;/ref&gt;.  While some twentieth-century commentary has sought to diminish this and related quotations, the consistency with Epicurean philosophy overall has more recently been explained.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Symons, "Epicurus, the foodies’ philosopher", pp. 13-30, in Fritz Allhoff and Dave Monroe, eds, Food &amp; Philosophy: Eat, think, and be merry, Malden (MA, USA): Blackwell Publishing, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

When Epicurus sought moderation at meals, he was also not averse to moderation in moderation, that is, to occasional luxury. His community also became known for its feasts of the twentieth (of the Greek month).

'''Epistrophe''' ({{lang-el|ἐπιστροφή}}, "return") is the repetition of the same word or words at the end of successive [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s or sentences.&lt;ref name="(schoolmaster.)1820"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Roberts (schoolmaster.)|title=A catechism of rhetoric|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DatbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=24 September 2013|year=1820|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as '''epiphora''' and occasionally as '''antistrophe'''. It is a [[figure of speech]] and the counterpart of [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]]. It is an extremely emphatic device because of the [[Stress (linguistics)|emphasis]] placed on the last word in a phrase or sentence.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2014}}

A '''consumer good''' or '''final good''' is any [[commodity]] that is produced or consumed by the [[consumer]] to satisfy current wants or needs. Consumer goods are ultimately consumed, rather than used in the production of another good. For example, a [[microwave oven]] or a [[bicycle]] that is sold to a consumer is a final good or consumer good, but the components that are sold to be used in those goods are [[intermediate good]]s. For example, [[textile]]s or [[transistor]]s can be used to make some further goods.

When used in [[measures of national income and output]], the term "final goods" includes only new goods. For instance, the [[GDP]] excludes items counted in an earlier year to prevent [[double counting (accounting)|double counting]] of production that is based on resales of the same item. In that context, the economic definition of goods includes what are commonly known as ''[[service (economics)|services]]''.
 
''Manufactured goods'' are goods that have been processed in any way. As such, they are the opposite of [[raw material]]s, but they include intermediate goods as well as final goods.

== Law ==
There are legal definitions. For example, the United States Consumer Product Safety Act has an extensive definition of '''consumer product''', which begins:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
CONSUMER PRODUCT.--The term ‘‘consumer product’’ means any article, or component part thereof, produced or distributed (i) for sale to a consumer for use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise, or (ii) for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise; but such term does not include—
(A) any article which is not customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption by, or enjoyment of, a consumer,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It then goes on to list eight additional specific exclusions and further details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/cpsa.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108013219/https://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/cpsa.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Durability ==
Final goods can be classified into the following categories:
#[[Durable goods]]
#[[Consumables|Nondurable goods]]
#Services

Consumer durable goods usually have a significant lifespan, which tends to be at least one year, based on the guarantee or warranty period. The maximum life depends upon the durability of the product or good. On the other hand, [[capital good]]s, which are tangible in nature, such as machinery or building or any other equipment that can be used in manufacturing of final product, are durable goods with limited lifespans that are determined by manufacturers before their sale. The longevity and the often-higher cost of durable goods usually cause consumers to postpone expenditures on them, which makes durables the most volatile (or cost-dependent) component of consumption.

Consumer nondurable goods are purchased for immediate use or for use very soon. Generally, the lifespan of nondurable goods is from a few minutes to up to three years: food, beverages, clothing, shoes and gasoline are examples.

Consumer services are the intangible in nature. They cannot be seen, felt or tasted by the consumer but still give satisfaction to the consumer. They are also inseparable and variable in nature: they are thus produced and consumed simultaneously. Examples are haircuts, auto repairs and landscaping.

== Buying habits ==
Final goods can be classified into the following categories, which are determined by the consumer's buying habits:
#Convenience goods 
#Shopping goods
#[[Speciality goods|Specialty goods]] 
#Unsought goods

=== Convenience goods ===
Convenience goods are regularly consumed and easily available. Generally, convenience goods come in the category of nondurable goods such as fast foods, cigarettes and tobacco with low value. Convenience goods are sold mostly by wholesalers or retailers to make them available to the consumers in good or large volume. Convenience goods can further be divided into staple convenience consumer goods and impulse convenience consumer goods.

Staple convenience consumer goods are the basic necessities of the consumer. These goods are easily available and in large quantity: milk, bread, sugar, etc.

Impulse convenience consumer goods do not belong to the priority list of the consumer. They are purchased without any prior planning, just on the basis of the [[impulse buying|impulse]]: potato wafers, candies, ice creams, cold drinks, etc.

=== Shopping consumer goods ===

Shopping consumer goods are the goods which take lot of time and proper planning before making purchase decision; in this case consumer does a lot of selection and comparison based on various parameters such as cost, brand, style, comfort etc., before buying an item. Shopping goods are costlier than convenience goods and are durable in nature. Consumer goods companies usually try to set up their shops and show rooms in active shopping area to attract customer attention and their main focus is to do lots of advertising and promotion so that to attract more customer.

Examples include clothing items, televisions, radios, footwear, home furnishings, etc.

=== Specialty consumer goods ===

Specialty goods are unique in nature; these are unusual and luxurious items available in the market. Specialty goods are mostly purchased by the upper class of the society as they are expensive in nature and difficult to be afforded by middle or lower-class people. Companies advertise their goods targeting the upper class. These goods do not fall under the category of necessity; rather they are purchased on the basis personal preference or desire. Brand name, uniqueness, and special features of an item are major attributes which attract customers and make them buy such products.

Examples include antiques, jewelry, wedding dresses, cars, etc.

=== Unsought consumer goods ===

Unsought goods neither belong to the necessity group of consumer goods list nor to specialty goods. They are always available in the market but are purchased by very few consumers, either based on their interest or their need for some specific reasons. The general public does not purchase such goods often.

Examples include [[snowshoe]]s, [[fire extinguisher]]s, [[flood insurance]], etc.

== Mergers and acquisitions ==

In the consumer product sector, there have been 107,891 deals announced between 1985 and 2018, which cumulates to a total value of around US$5,835 billion. 2007 was the year with the largest value (US$4,888 billion) followed by a steep slump in 2009 (-70.9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first wave in 2007, now is the second big M&amp;A wave in the consumer products sector, and a decline is expected.

'''Fitampoha''' is a traditional ceremony of the [[Sakalava]] people of [[Madagascar]], taking place every five years at [[Belo Sur Tsiribihina]]. The main ritual of Fitampoha consists in bathing the [[relics]] of the ancient Sakalava kings in the waters of the [[Tsiribihina River]], once part of the Sakalava kingdom of [[Menabe]]. The most venerated of the ancient kings is [[Andriamisara I]], who is considered the common ancestor of both the main Sakalava [[dynasty|dynasties]], that of Menabe and that of [[Boina Kingdom|Boina]].

In [[religious studies]] and [[folkloristics]], '''folk religion''', '''popular religion''', or '''vernacular religion''' comprises various forms and expressions of [[religion]] that are distinct from the official doctrines and practices of [[organized religion]]. The precise definition of folk religion varies among scholars. Sometimes also termed '''popular belief''', it consists of [[ethnic]] or regional [[religion|religious]] customs under the umbrella of a [[religion]], but outside official [[doctrine]] and practices.&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowman | first=Marion |editor-first=Steven| editor-last=Sutcliffe |title=Religion: empirical studies |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2004 |pages=3–4 |chapter=Chapter 1: Phenomenology, Fieldwork, and Folk Religion |isbn=0-7546-4158-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BU2BSj4dcHMC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22folk+religion%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "folk religion" is generally held to encompass two related but separate subjects.  The first is the religious dimension of [[folk culture]], or the folk-cultural dimensions of religion. The second refers to the study of [[syncretism]]s between two cultures with different stages of formal expression, such as the melange of African folk beliefs and [[Roman Catholicism]] that led to the development of [[Vodun]] and [[Santería]], and similar mixtures of formal religions with folk cultures.

[[Chinese folk religion]], folk Christianity, folk Hinduism, and folk Islam are examples of folk religion associated with major religions. The term is also used, especially by the [[clergy]] of the faiths involved, to describe the desire of people who otherwise infrequently attend religious [[worship]], do not belong to a [[church body|church]] or similar religious society, and who have not made a formal profession of [[faith]] in a particular [[creed]], to have religious weddings or funerals, or (among Christians) to have their children [[baptism|baptised]].&lt;ref name="Bowman"/&gt;

==Definition==
In ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', [[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]] characterized "folk religion" as either "religion which occurs in small, local communities which does not adhere to the norms of large systems" or "the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level."{{sfn|Bowker|2003}}

[[Don Yoder]] argued that there were five separate ways of defining folk religion.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The first was a perspective rooted in a [[cultural evolution]]ary framework which understood folk religion as representing the survivals of older forms of religion; in this, it would constitute "the survivals, in an official religious context, of beliefs and behavior inherited from earlier stages of the culture's development".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as the survivals of pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as the survivals of Medieval Catholicism.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of [[indigenous American]] and [[indigenous African|African]] communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=12&amp;ndash;13}}

Yoder's third definition was that often employed within folkloristics, which held that folk religion was "the interaction of belief, ritual, custom, and mythology in traditional societies", representing that which was often pejoratively characterised as [[superstition]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=13}} The fourth definition provided by Yoder stated that folk religion represented the "folk interpretation and expression of religion". Noting that this definition would not encompass beliefs that were largely unconnected from organised religion, such as in [[witchcraft]], he therefore altered this definition by including the concept of "folk [[religiosity]]", thereby defining folk religion as "the deposit in culture of folk religiosity, the full range of folk attitudes to religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=13&amp;ndash;14}} His fifth and final definition represented a "practical working definition" that combined elements from these various other definitions. Thus, he summarized folk religion as "the totality of all those views and practices of religion that exist among the people apart from and alongside the strictly theological and liturgical forms of the official religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=14}}

Yoder described "folk religion" as existing "in a complex society in relation to and in tension with the organized religion(s) of that society. Its relatively unorganized character differentiates it from organized religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=11}}

Alternately, the sociologist of religion [[Matthias Zic Varul]] defined "folk religion" as "the relatively un-reflected aspect of ordinary practices and beliefs that are oriented towards, or productive of, something beyond the immediate here-and-now: everyday transcendence".{{sfn|Varul|2015|p=449}}

===Historical development===

In Europe the study of "folk religion" emerged from the study of ''religiöse Volkskund'', a German term which was used in reference to "the religious dimension of folk-culture, or the folk-cultural dimension of religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=2}} This term was first employed by a German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] preacher, [[Paul Drews]], in a 1901 article that he published which was titled "''Religiöse Volkskunde, eine Aufgabe der praktischen Theologie''". This article was designed to be read by young Lutheran preachers leaving the seminary, to equip them for the popular variants of Lutheranism that they would encounter among their congregations and which would differ from the official, doctrinal Lutheranism that they had been accustomed to.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=2&amp;ndash;3}} Although developing within a religious environment, the term came to be adopted by German academics in the field of [[folkloristics]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} During the 1920s and 1930s, theoretical studies of ''religiöse Volkskund'' had been produced by the folklorists [[Josef Weigert]], [[Werner Boette]], and [[Max Rumpf]], all of whom had focused on religiosity within German peasant communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} Over the coming decades, [[Georg Schreiber]] established an Institut für religiöse Volkskund in [[Munich]] while a similar department was established in [[Salzburg]] by [[Hanns Koren]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}} Other prominent academics involved in the study of the phenomenon were [[Heinrich Schauert]] and [[Rudolf Kriss]], the latter of whom collected one of the largest collections of folk-religious art and material culture in Europe, later housed in Munich's [[Bayerisches Nationalmuseum]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}} Throughout the 20th century, many studies were made of folk religion in Europe, paying particular attention to such subjects as [[pilgrimage]] and the use of [[shrines]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}}

In the Americas, the study of folk religion developed among [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] studying the syncretistic cultures of the Caribbean and Latin America.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The pioneer in this field was Redfield, whose 1930 book ''Tepoztlán: A Mexican Village'' contrasted and examined the relationship between "folk religion" and "official religion" in a peasant community.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Yoder later noted that although the earliest known usage of the term "folk religion" in the English language was unknown, it probably developed as a translation of the German ''Volksreligion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} One of the earliest prominent usages of the term was in the title of [[Joshua Trachtenberg]]'s 1939 work ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The term also gained increasing usage within the academic field of [[comparative religion]], appearing in the titles of [[Ichiro Hori]]'s ''Folk Religion in Japan'', [[Martin Nilsson]]'s ''Greek Folk Religion'', and [[Charles Miller Leslie|Charles Leslie]]'s reader, the ''Anthropology of Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Courses on the study of folk religion came to be taught at various universities in the United States, such as [[John Messenger]]'s at [[Indiana University]] and [[Don Yoder]]'s at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}}
Although the subject of folk religion fell within the remit of scholars operating in both folkloristics and religious studies, by 1974 Yoder noted that U.S.-based academics in the latter continued to largely ignore it, instead focusing on the study of [[theology]] and institutionalised religion; he contrasted this with the situation in Europe, where historians of religion had devoted much time to studying folk religiosity.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=6}} He also lamented that many U.S.-based folklorists also neglected the subject of religion because it did not fit within the standard genre-based system for cataloguing folklore.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=9}}

The term "folk religion" came to be increasingly rejected in the 1990s and 2000s by scholars seeking more precise terminology.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=4}}

===Problems and critique===

Yoder noted that one problem with the use of the term "folk religion" was that it did not fit into the work of those scholars who used the term "religion" in reference solely to [[organized religion]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} He highlighted the example of the prominent sociologist of religion [[Émile Durkheim]], who insisted that "religion" was organized in order to contrast it with "[[magic (paranormal)|magic]]".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} Yoder noted that scholars adopting these perspectives often preferred the term "folk belief" over "folk religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}}

A second problem with the use of "folk religion" that Yoder highlighted was that some scholars, particularly those operating in the [[sociology of religion]], used the term as a synonym for [[ethnic religion]] (which is alternately known as national religion or tribal religion), meaning a religion closely tied to a particular ethnic or national group and is thus contrasted with a "universal religion" which cuts across ethnic and national boundaries.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}} Among the scholars to have adopted this use of terminology are E. Wilbur Bock.{{sfn|Bock|1966|p=204}}

The folklorist Leonard Norman Primiano argued that the use of "folk religion", as well as related terms like "popular religion" and "unofficial religion", by scholars, does "an extreme disservice" to the forms of religiosity that scholarship is examining, because &amp;ndash; in his opinion &amp;ndash; such terms are "residualistic, [and] derogatory".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=38}} He argued that using such terminology implies that there is "a pure element" to religion "which is in some way transformed, even contaminated, by its exposure to human communities".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=39}} As a corrective, he suggested that scholars use "vernacular religion" as an alternative.{{sfn|Primiano|1995|pp=41&amp;ndash;42}} Defining this term, Primiano stated that "vernacular religion" is, "by definition, religion as it is lived: as human beings encounter, understand, interpret, and practice it. Since religion inherently involves interpretation, it is impossible for the religion of an individual not to be vernacular".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=44}}

Kapaló was critical of this approach, deeming it "mistaken" and arguing that switching from "folk religion" to "vernacular religion" results in the scholar "picking up a different selection of things from the world".{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=9}} He cautioned that both terms were "ideological and semantic load[ed]" and warned scholars to pay attention to the associations that each word had.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|pp=15&amp;ndash;16}}

[[Chinese folk religion]] or Shenism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GBdX2ELnkXQC&amp;pg=PA21 |title= Reinventing Chinese Syncretic Religion: Shenism |publisher= Google |date = 2007-02-23 |accessdate= 2011-11-20|isbn= 9789812308658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/9/7/how-we-came-to-pai-shen | title = How we came to ‘pai shen’ | publisher = Straits times | date = 2009-09-07 | accessdate = 2011-11-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111207225051/http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/9/7/how-we-came-to-pai-shen/ | archivedate = 2011-12-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9MmNaNebFD8C&amp;pg=PA198 |title = Religious Diversity in Singapore |publisher = Google |date = 2001-09-11 | accessdate =2011-11-20|isbn = 9789812307545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are labels used to describe the collection of [[ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] traditions which have historically comprised the predominant belief system in [[China]] and among [[Han Chinese]] ethnic groups up to the present day. Shenism describes [[Chinese mythology]] and includes the worship of ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' ([[spirit]], [[Deity|god]], [[awareness]], [[consciousness]]) which can be [[nature god|nature deities]], [[Taizu (disambiguation)|Taizu]] or clan deities, [[city god]]s, [[national god|national deities]], [[culture hero]]es and [[demigod]]s, [[Chinese dragon|dragons]] and [[veneration of the dead|ancestors]]. "Shenism" as a term was first published by AJA Elliot in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = High beam | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-126163460.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with [[Taoism]], since over the centuries institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administrate local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a branch of Shenism, since it sprang out of folk religion and [[Chinese philosophy]]. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous.  With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Religion | year = 2011 | title = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese folk religion is one of the [[major religious groups|major religious traditions in the world]]. In [[People's Republic of China|China]] more than 30% of the population adheres to Shenism or Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://chartsbin.com/view/sgx |title=Chinese Folk Religion Adherents by Country |publisher=Charts bin |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate = 2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk Islam==
{{further |Islamic mythology|Druze|Alevi|Alawi|Kebatinan|Abangan|Adat}}
Folk Islam is an [[umbrella term]] used to collectively describe forms of [[Islam]] that incorporate native folk beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook|first= Chris|title = Spirituality and Psychiatry| publisher= [[RCPsych]] Publications | year = 2009 | page = 242 | isbn = 978-1-904671-71-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Folk Islam has been described as the Islam of the "urban poor, country people, and tribes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ridgeon | first = Lloyd | title =Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present | publisher =[[Routledge]]|year=2003|page=280|isbn = 978-0-415-29796-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] or "High" Islam (Gellner, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Sinisa Malesevic | last= Malešević| first = Siniša | title = Ernest Gellner and Contemporary Social Thought|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2007|page=189|isbn = 978-0-521-70941-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufism]] and Sufi concepts are often integrated into Folk Islam.

Various practices and beliefs have been identified with the concept of "folk Islam". They include the following:

==Folk Judaism==
In one of the first major academic works on the subject, titled ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg provided a definition of Jewish folk religion as consisting of ideas and practices that whilst not meeting with the approval of religious leaders enjoyed wide popularity such that they must be included in what he termed the field of religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg, 1939, Forgotten Books, Preface, pg xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; This included unorthodox beliefs about demons and angels, and magical practices.

Later studies have emphasized the significance of the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] to the many Jewish folk customs linked to mourning and in particular to the belief in ''hibbut ha-qever''  (torture of the grave) a belief that the dead are tortured in their grave for three days after burial by demons until they remember their names. This idea began with early eschatalogical [[aggadah]] and was then further developed by the kabbalists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', Edited by Adele Berlin,  Oxford University Press, 2011, pg 344,&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Raphael Patai has been acknowledged as one of the first to utilize anthropology to study Jewish folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'',
by Victor D. Sanua, pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he has drawn attention to the important role of the female divine element,&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 27&lt;/ref&gt; which he sees in the goddess [[Asherah]], the [[Shekhinah]], the [[Matronit]], and [[Lilith]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Writer Stephen Sharot has stated that Jewish popular religion in common with other forms of folk religion, has a focus on the [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]], or [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]], i.e. it is used to assist in protecting the individual from sickness, and misfortune.  He emphasizes that while Rabbinical Judaism dealt with orthodox Jewish ritual, and [[halakah]], magicians claimed to use unorthodox magical rituals to help people in everyday life.  He points to the example of a relatively professionalised type of magician being the [[Baal Shem|ba'al shem]] of Poland, who beginning in the 16th century thrived with the popularity of practical kabbalah in the 18th century.  These ba'al shem promised to use their knowledge of the names of god, and the angels, along with exorcism, chiromancy, and [[herbal medicine]] to bring harm to enemies, and  success in areas of social life such as marriage, and childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Liebman]] has written that the essence of the folk religion of American Jews is their social ties to one another, illustrated by the finding  that religious practices that would prevent social integration -such as a strict interpretation of  dietary laws and the Sabbath- have been abandoned, whilst the practices that are followed -such as the [[Passover seder]], social rites of passage, and the High Holy Days- are ones that strengthen Jewish family and community integration.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 152&lt;/ref&gt; Liebman described the rituals and beliefs of contemporary Jewish folk religion in his works, ''The Ambivalent American Jew'' (1973) and ''American Jewry: Identity and Affiliation''.

==In sociology==
In [[sociology]], folk religion is often contrasted with [[elite religion]]. Folk religion is defined as the beliefs, practices, rituals and symbols originating from sources other than the religion's leadership. Folk religion in many instances is tolerated by the religion's leadership, although they may consider it an error.&lt;ref&gt;Leibman, Charles. "The Religion of the American Jew". ''The Ambivalent American Jew''. Jewish Publication Society. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept is [[lived religion]], the study of religion as practiced by believers.

A '''ghost bike''' (also referred to as a '''ghostcycle''' or '''WhiteCycle''') is a [[bicycle]] [[roadside memorial]], placed where a cyclist has been killed or severely injured, usually by a [[automobile|motor vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Tom [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1034562/White-ghost-bikes-pay-tribute-dead-riders-danger-spots-Britain.html White 'ghost bikes' pay tribute to dead riders in danger spots across Britain] Daily Mail, 1 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{Citation | last =Sanders  | first =Jacob Quinn | title =Ghost Bikes: Rough memorials honor cyclists killed while riding | newspaper =post-gazette | date =1 December 2010| url =http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10335/1107199-51.stm  | accessdate =1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from being a memorial, it is usually intended as a reminder to passing motorists to share the road. Ghost bikes are usually junk bicycles painted white, sometimes with a placard attached, and locked to a suitable object close to the scene of the accident. They are also sometimes stripped of their tires, to deter theft.

A ghost bike may also refer to a bike without a rider. By jumping off while the bicycle is in motion, it will continue to roll until falling over or hitting an object that stops it. This is the original ghost bike.

[[File:Bicianimita de Arturo Aguilera.JPG|thumb|left|Ghost bike or "Bicianimita" in [[Chile]], with a traditional small house for the soul of a road accident victim]]
According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the first recorded ghost bike was in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in 2003. A witness to a collision between a cyclist and a car placed a painted bike at the location with a message that read: "Cyclist struck here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/nov/10/ghost-bikes-memorials-cycling-victims | title=Ghost bikes: memorials to road victims blamed for putting people off cycling |work=The Guardian  | date=10 November 2011 | accessdate=24 November 2011 | author=Walker, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original idea of [[White bicycle|painting bikes white]] reportedly goes back to the city of Amsterdam in the 1960s as an anarchist project to liberate two-wheel transport—white bikes were free, help yourself and then leave it for someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility  |url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1899_reg.html |last=Furness |first=Zack |year=2010 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-1-59213-613-1 |pages=55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ghost bike idea in the United States may have originated with a project by [[San Francisco]] artist [[Jo Slota]], begun in April 2002. This was a purely artistic endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.momentumplanet.com/features/ghost-bikes |title=Ghost Bikes |author=Terry Lowe |work=Momentum Planet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612115451/http://www.momentumplanet.com/features/ghost-bikes |archivedate=12 June 2009 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slota was intrigued by the [[abandoned bicycles]] that he found around the city, locked up but stripped of useful parts. He began painting them white, and posted photographs on his website, ghostbike.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghostbike.net/ |title=Jo Slota's website |publisher=Ghostbike.net |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the idea was taken up for different purposes, Slota faced a dilemma. San Francisco is one of the safer U.S. cities for bicyclists, but memorial ghost bikes sprang up there as elsewhere, changing perceptions of his project.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

A ghost bike memorial project was started in St. Louis in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Mark [http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2009/oct/25/friends-seek-ghost-bike-memorial-hit-and-run-victi/ Friends seek ghost bike memorial for hit-and-run victim] ''Lawrence Journal-World'' 25 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After observing a motorist strike a bicyclist in a bike lane on Holly Hills Boulevard, Patrick Van Der Tuin placed a white-painted bicycle on the spot with a hand-painted sign reading "Cyclist Struck Here".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1395">'''Haapsalu shawl''' or '''Haapsalu scarf''' is a '''knitted lace''' shawl that originated in the [[seaside resort]] town of [[Haapsalu]], [[Estonia]] during the early 19th century.
 
==Description==
A traditional Haapsalu shawl is a rectangle measuring 100x100 to 150 x150 cm square. It consists of three parts - a center section, a border and an edge, which is knit separately and sewn to the border. The shawls are knit from fine lamb's wool yarn using #3 or #4 knitting needles. The master artisans knit the shawls so fine that they can be pulled through a ladies' [[wedding ring]].

==History==
Russian aristocrats, including the [[Romanov]] family, frequented Haapsalu to bathe in the healing mud salts. Those same spas are in operation today. Those early visitors recognized the trademarks of an [[artisan]] and bought the [[shawls]] as souvenirs and gifts. Later the Haapsalu shawl became known in [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]] and were sometimes displayed at exhibitions. 

==Today==
The Knitters Guild of Haapsalu has preserved the tradition of the knitted lace shawl. Their works are available at the museum in Haapsalu, Estonia.

Examples of this art can be seen by virtual tour of the [http://www.visitestonia.com/en/haapsalu-shawl-museum Haapsalu Shawl Museum].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5705">'''Ikigai''' (生き甲斐,) is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for "a reason for being." The word ‘Ikigai’ usually refers to the source of value in one's life or the things that make one's life worthwhile.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakanishi|first=N|date=1999-05-01|title='Ikigai' in older Japanese people|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/28.3.323|journal=Age and Ageing|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=323–324|doi=10.1093/ageing/28.3.323|issn=1468-2834}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word roughly translates to the "thing that you live for"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-japanese-concept-ikigai-is-a-formula-for-happiness-and-meaning-8e497e5afa99|title=The Japanese Concept ‘Ikigai’ is a Formula for Happiness and Meaning|date=2017-11-30|work=Better Humans|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it also has the nuance of "the reason for which you wake up in the morning" similar to a daily purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theascent.pub/the-japanese-secret-to-finding-ones-purpose-is-forgetting-oneself-6828edf58310|title=The Japanese Secret to Finding One’s Purpose is Forgetting Oneself|date=2018-09-25|work=The Ascent|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual's ikigai is personal to them and specific to their lives, [[Value (ethics)|values]] and [[Belief|beliefs]]. It reflects the [[Self-realization|inner self]] of an individual and expresses that faithfully, while simultaneously creating a [[mental state]] in which the individual feels at ease. Activities that allow one to feel ikigai are never forced on an individual; they are often spontaneous, and always undertaken willingly, giving the individual satisfaction and a sense of meaning to life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''ikigai'' [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] two Japanese words: {{nihongo|''iki''|[[wikt:生き]]}} meaning "life; alive" and ''kai'' ([[wikt:甲斐|甲斐]]) meaning "(an) effect; (a) result; (a) fruit; (a) worth; (a) use; (a) benefit; (no, little) avail" ([[rendaku|sequentially voiced]] as ''gai'') to arrive at "a reason for living [being alive]; a meaning for [to] life; what [something that] makes life worth living; a raison d'etre".&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe Toshirō (渡邊敏郎), Edmund R. Skrzypczak, and Paul Snowden, eds. (2003), ''[[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary]]'' (新和英大辞典), 5th edition, Kenkyusha, pp. 127, 459, 130. In the game [[Go (game)|go]], ''iki'' especially means "[[Life and death|alive]]" (able to remain on the board indefinitely): "in go normally a situation in which a connected group of stones of any size contains at least two independent liberties [''me''] and so cannot be captured by an opponent".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the culture of [[Okinawa]], ''ikigai'' is thought of as "a reason to get up in the morning"; that is, a reason to enjoy life. In a [[TED Talk]], [[Dan Buettner]] suggested ''ikigai'' as one of the reasons people in the area had such long lives.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_buettner_how_to_live_to_be_100?language=en&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''ikigai'' usually is used to indicate the source of value in one's life or the things that make one's life worthwhile.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chaaipani.com/ikigai/|title=Ikigai – What makes you come alive?|last=|first=|date=|website=Chaaipani|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the word is used to refer to mental and spiritual circumstances under which individuals feel that their lives are valuable. It's not linked to one's financial status&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Even if a person feels that the present is dark, but they have a goal in mind, they may feel ''ikigai''.  Behaviours that make one feel ''ikigai'' are not actions one is forced to take—these are natural and spontaneous actions.

In the article titled {{nihongo|''Ikigai — jibun no kanosei, kaikasaseru katei''|}} ("Ikigai: the process of allowing the self's possibilities to blossom") Kobayashi Tsukasa says that "people can feel real ikigai only when, on the basis of personal maturity, the satisfaction of various desires, love and happiness, encounters with others, and a sense of the value of life, they proceed toward self-realization."&lt;ref name="JapAm"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520201330|title=What Makes Life Worth Living?: How Japanese and Americans Make Sense of Their Worlds|last=Mathews|first=Gordon|publisher=University of California Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kobayashi |first=Tsukasa |date=1990-04-04 |title={{nihongo|Ikigai — jibun no kanosei, kaikasaseru katei|}}

'''International Mother Language Institute''' ('''IMLI''') is statutory body in [[Bangladesh]] whose function is the preservation of languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/protect-all-spoken-words-575971|title=To protect all spoken words|date=2016-02-21|website=The Daily Star|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Declaration of 21 February as the International Mother Language Day by the United Nations on 17 November 1999 is an unprecedented event not only for the Bangla language but also in the history of all mother languages of the world. In a historic meeting commemorating this achievement on 7 December 1999 the honourable Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina announced that an international mother language institute would be established in Dhaka for the research and the preservation of the dignity and the rights  of augmenting/expanding as well as nearly extinct languages of the world. According to that declaration, she laid the foundation of the International Mother Language Institute (IMLI) at 1/ ka Segunbagicha, [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/59445/Mother-language-Int.-hardly-functional|title=Mother Language Institute hardly functional|website=Prothom Alo|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on 15 March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news/saving-languages-preserving-knowledge|title=SAVING LANGUAGES, PRESERVING KNOWLEDGE|date=2013-03-07|website=The Daily Star|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi A. Annan was present on that occasion. Honourable Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina]] inaugurated the newly constructed building of the International Mother Language Institute on the Martyrs' Day and International Mother Language Day, 2010. Since then, the International Mother Language Institute is moving ahead with its set mission and vision.

Construction started on 6 April 2003, stopped with the next change of government, and resumed on 11 February 2008. Six stories of the proposed twelve has been built. It was officially completed on 21 February 2010. In 2015 UNESCO applied Category II Institute status to IMLI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/10/18/unesco-s-executive-board-clears-dhaka-based-international-mother-language-institute-for-approval|title=UNESCO's executive board clears Dhaka-based International Mother Language Institute for approval|website=bdnews24.com|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2015/nov/07/intl-mother-language-institute-gets-unesco-recognition|title=Int’l Mother Language Institute gets UNESCO recognition {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kim Il-sung]] (1912–1994) developed the ideology, originally viewed as a variant of [[Marxism–Leninism]] until it became distinctly Korean in character&lt;ref name="North Korea: State of Paranoia"/&gt; whilst incorporating the [[historical materialist]] ideas of Marxism–Leninism and strongly emphasizing the individual, the nation state and its [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="North Korea: State of Paranoia"/&gt; Consequently, the [[North Korean government]] adopted ''Juche'' into a set of principles it uses to justify its policy decisions from the 1950s onwards. Such principles include moving the nation towards claimed ''jaju'' ("independence"),&lt;ref name="North Korea: State of Paranoia"/&gt; through the construction of ''jarip'' ("national economy") and an emphasis upon ''jawi'' ("self-defence") in order to establish [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="North Korea: State of Paranoia"/&gt;

The practice of ''Juche'' is firmly rooted in the ideals of sustainability through agricultural independence and a lack of dependency. The ''Juche'' ideology has been criticized by many scholars and observers as a mechanism for sustaining the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] rule of the North Korean regime&lt;ref name="The Impossible State: North Korea Past and Future"&gt;{{cite book|author= Victor Cha|date= 2009|title= The Impossible State: North Korea Past and Future|publisher= Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} and justifying the country's heavy-handed [[isolationism]] and oppression of the North Korean people.&lt;ref name="The Impossible State: North Korea Past and Future"/&gt; It has also been described as a form of [[Korean ethnic nationalism]], but one that promotes the Kim family as the saviours of the "Korean race" and acts as a foundation of the subsequent [[North Korean cult of personality|personality cult surrounding them]].&lt;ref name="North Korea: State of Paranoia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Impossible State: North Korea Past and Future"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2012|title=Kim Jong Il: The Great Man|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House|location=Pyongyang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Juche'' comes from a [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese word]] {{lang|ja|主體}} whose [[Japanese language|Japanese]] reading is ''shutai''. The word was coined in 1887 to translate the concept of ''{{lang|de|Subjekt}}'' in [[German philosophy]] ([[Subject (philosophy)|subject]], meaning "the entity perceiving or acting upon an object or environment") into Japanese. The word migrated to the [[Korean language]] at around the turn of the century and retained this meaning.{{sfn|Myers|2015|p=11}} ''Shutai'' went on to appear in Japanese translations of [[Karl Marx]]'s writings.{{sfn|Myers|2015|p=12}} North Korean editions of Marx used the word ''Juche'' even before the word was attributed to [[Kim Il-sung]] in its supposedly novel meaning in 1955.{{sfn|Myers|2015|p=13}}

In today's political discourse on [[North Korea]], ''Juche'' has a connotation of "self-reliance", "autonomy" and "independence".{{sfn|Cumings|1997|pp=207, 403–04}}{{sfn|Abt|2014|pp=73–74}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea's Twentieth-Century Odyssey|last=Robinson|first=Michael E|year=2007|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-3174-5|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often defined in opposition to the Korean concept of ''[[Sadae]]'', or reliance on the great powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea since 1850|last1=Lone|first1=Stewart|last2=McCormack|first2=Gavan|authorlink2=Gavan McCormack|publisher=Longman Cheshire|location=Melbourne|year=1993|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]]ns use the word without reference to the North Korean ideology.{{sfn|Myers|2015|pp=13–14}}

== History ==
=== Origin ===
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar|Variants}}
Official statements by the [[North Korean government]] attribute the origin of ''Juche'' to Kim Il-sung's experiences in the Anti-Imperialist Youth League in 1930 in his "liberation struggle" against Japan.&lt;ref name="Juche Idea: Answers to Hundred Questions"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyung-chan Kim and Tong-gyu Kim. ''Human Remolding in North Korea: A Social History of Education''. Lanham, MD: University Press of America. 2005. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented reference to ''Juche'' as an ideology appeared in 1955 in a speech given by Kim Il-sung entitled "On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing ''Juche'' in Ideological Work". The speech had been delivered to promote a political [[purge]] similar to the earlier [[Yan'an Rectification Movement]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|journal=Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=13|author=高麗大學校亞細亞問題硏究所|year=1970|page=63|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
{{History of North Korea}}
In his 1955 speech, the first known to refer to ''Juche'', Kim Il-sung said: &lt;blockquote&gt;To make revolution in Korea we must know Korean history and geography as well as the customs of the Korean people. Only then is it possible to educate our people in a way that suits them and to inspire in them an ardent love for their native place and their motherland.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=421–22}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the speech "On Socialist Construction and the South Korean Revolution in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" given on 14 April 1965, Kim Il-sung outlined the three fundamental principles of ''Juche'':
# Political independence ({{korean|hangul=자주|rr=jaju|mr=chaju|context=north}})
# Economic self-sustenance ({{korean|hangul=자립|rr=jarip|mr=charip|context=north}})
# Self-reliance in defence ({{korean|hangul=자위|rr=jawi|mr=chawi|context=north}})

''[[On the Juche Idea]]'', the main work on ''Juche'', was published in North Korea in [[Kim Jong-il]]'s name in 1982.{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=19}} In North Korea it functions as "the authoritative and comprehensive explanation of ''Juche''".{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=19}} According to the treatise, the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) is responsible for indoctrinating the masses in the ways of ''Juche'' thinking.{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=19}} According to the treatise, ''Juche'' is inexorably linked with Kim Il-sung and it "represents the guiding idea of the Korean Revolution [...] we are confronted with the honorable task of modeling the whole society on the ''Juche'' idea".{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=19}} Kim Jong-il states in the work that ''Juche'' is not a creative application of Marxism–Leninism, but rather "a new era in the development of human history"{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=19}} while criticizing the "communists and nationalists" of the 1920s for their elitist posture, claiming that they were "divorced from the masses".{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=20}} The WPK's break with basic premises of Marxism–Leninism emerges more clearly in the article "Let Us March Under the Banner of Marxism–Leninism and the ''Juche'' Idea".{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=20}}

In August 1997, the Central People's Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [[promulgated]] regulations regarding use of the [[North Korean calendar|''Juche'' Era calendar]]. [[Gregorian calendar]] dates are used for years before 1912 while years from 1912 (the year of [[Day of the Sun|Kim Il-sung's birth]]) are described as "''Juche'' years". The Gregorian year {{CURRENTYEAR}}, for example, is "''Juche'' {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1911}}" as {{CURRENTYEAR}}-1911={{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1911}}. When used, "''Juche'' years" are often accompanied by the Gregorian equivalent, i.e. "''Juche'' {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1911}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}" or "''Juche'' {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1911}} ({{CURRENTYEAR}})".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1997/9708/news8/25.htm#4 "Rules on use of Juche Era adopted"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313071908/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1997/9708/news8/25.htm|date=13 March 2010}} KCNA.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International outreach ===
Kim's regime saw Juche principles as applicable around the world, not just in Korea.{{sfn|Cumings|1997|p=404}} Since 1976 North Korea has organized international seminars on ''Juche''. The International Scientific Seminar on the ''Juche'' Idea took place in [[Antananarivo]] from 28 September to 30 September 1976 under the sponsorship of the [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar]]. Many prominent party and government officials, public figures, representatives of revolutionary and progressive organizations, scientists and journalists from more than fifty countries attended. [[List of Presidents of Madagascar|Malagasy President]] [[Didier Ratsiraka]] expressed strong sympathies and support for North Korea. An excerpt from the opening speech says:&lt;blockquote&gt;Regardless of the opposition forces, the determination of the people and their strength and conviction are not measured by territorial dimensions, possession of advanced technology, still less, opulence or riches. For those who wish to forget the lesson of history so easily and so quickly, Algeria, Viet Nam, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola – and closer to us – Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Azania are excellent examples which make them deeply reflect on. What we want is not the perfection of political independence alone. The evil forces craftily manipulate the economic levers in order to perpetuate their supremacy and reduce us to vassals and eternal mendicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Juche, the Banner of Independence |year= 1977 |publisher= Foreign Languages Publishing House |location= Pyongyang |oclc= 4048345 |page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The International Institute of the ''Juche'' Idea was established{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} in [[Tokyo]] in 1978 to supervise international ''Juche'' research-groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Hyung Gu Lynn | date = 2007 | title = Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 | publisher = Zed Books | pp= 107–08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Juche Tower|''Juche'' Tower]] in Pyongyang, completed in 1982, incorporated commemorative plaques from supporters and ''Juche'' Study Groups from around the world.{{sfn|Abt|2014|pp=73–74}} In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[Black Panther Party]] of the United States expressed sympathy for the Juche ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Black Panther's Secret North Korean Fetish |url= http://www.nknews.org/2012/12/the-black-panther-north-korean-juche-fetish |website=NKNEWS.ORG |access-date=26 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150510095420/http://www.nknews.org/2012/12/the-black-panther-north-korean-juche-fetish |archivedate= 10 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= "Our Common Struggle Against Our Common Enemy": North Korea and the American Radical Left |url= http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/NKIDP_eDossier_14_North_Korea_and_the_American_Radical_Left.pdf |website= WilsonCenter.org |publisher= Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |access-date= 26 May 2015 |format= PDF |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160306162949/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/NKIDP_eDossier_14_North_Korea_and_the_American_Radical_Left.pdf |archivedate= 6 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[Nepal Workers and Peasants Party]] identified ''Juche'' as the guiding idea in its governance of the city of [[Bhaktapur]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Concepts ==
=== Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism&lt;!-- 'Kimilsungism', 'Kimjongilism', and 'Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism' redirecte here. --&gt; ===
'''Kimilsungism'''&lt;!-- Boldface per WP:R#PLA. --&gt; was first mentioned by [[Kim Jong-il]] in the 1970s{{sfn|Lim|2012|p=561}} and was introduced alongside the [[Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System]].{{sfn|Lim|2012|p=561}} Not long after the term's introduction into the North Korean [[wikt:lexicon|lexicon]], Kim Jong-il allegedly launched a "{{sic|Kimilsungism-isation}} of the Whole Society" campaign.{{sfn|Lim|2012|p=561}} These campaigns were introduced so as to strengthen Kim Jong-il's position within the Workers' Party of Korea.{{sfn|Lim|2012|p=561}} According to political analyst Lim Jae-cheon, "''Kimilsungism'' refers to the thoughts of [[Kim Il-sung]]. It is interchangeable with the {{sic|''juche''}} idea".{{sfn|Lim|2012|p=561}} However, in his 1976 speech "On Correctly Understanding the Originality of Kimilsungism" he said that Kimilsungism comprises the "''Juche'' idea and a far-reaching revolutionary theory and leadership method evolved from this idea".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=89}} In the past Kim Il-sung's thoughts had been described by the official media as "contemporary [[Marxism–Leninism]]", but by calling it Kimilsungism Kim Jong-il was trying to elevate it to the same level as [[Maoism]], [[Hoxhaism]] and [[Stalinism]].{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=89–90}} The younger Kim further argued that Kim Il-sung's thoughts had evolved and they therefore deserved their own distinct name.{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=89–90}} He further added that "Kimilsungism is an original idea that cannot be explained within the frameworks of Marxism–Leninism. The idea of ''Juche'', which constitutes the quintessence of Kimilsungism, is an idea newly discovered in the history of mankind".{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=89–90}} Kim Jong-il went further, stating that Marxism–Leninism had become obsolete and must be replaced by Kimilsungism:{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=90}} {{quote|The revolutionary theory of Kimilsungism is a revolutionary theory which has provided solutions to problems arising in the revolutionary practice in a new age different from the era that gave rise to Marxism–Leninism. On the basis of ''Juche'' (idea), the leader gave a profound explanation of the theories, strategies and tactics of [[national liberation]], class emancipation and human liberations in our era. Thus, it can be said that the revolutionary theory of Kimilsungism is a perfect revolutionary theory of Communism in the era of ''Juche''.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=90}}}}

According to analyst Shin Gi-wook, the ideas of ''Juche'' and Kimilsungism were in essence the "expressions of North Korean particularism over supposedly more universalistic Marxism–Leninism".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=90}} In many ways, it signaled a move from socialism to [[nationalism]].{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=90}} This was made very clear in a speech in 1982, when North Korea celebrated Kim Il-sung's 70th [[Day of the Sun|birthday]] in which love for the nation came before love for socialism.{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=90–91}} This particularism gave birth to such concepts as A Theory of the Korean Nation as Number One and Socialism of Our Style.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}}

Following the [[death of Kim Jong-il]], Kimilsungism was turned into '''Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;  at the 4th Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea.{{sfn|Rüdiger|2013|p=45}} As well as stating that the WPK was "the party of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il", Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism was made "the only guiding idea of the party".{{sfn|Rüdiger|2013|p=45}} In the 4th Conference's aftermath, the [[Korean Central News Agency]] (KCNA) stated that "the Korean people have long called the revolutionary policies ideas of the President [Kim Il-sung] and Kim Jong-il as Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism and recognized it as the guiding of the nation".{{sfn|Alton|Chidley|2013|p=109}} [[Kim Jong-un]], the WPK First Secretary, said that "Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is an integral system of the idea, theory and method of ''Juche'' and a great revolutionary ideology representative of the ''Juche'' era. Guided by Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, we should conduct Party building and Party activities, so as to sustain the revolutionary character of our Party and advance the revolution and construction in line with the ideas and intentions of the President and the General."&lt;ref name="Speech"&gt;Kim Jong-un, ''Let Us Brilliantly Accomplish the Revolutionary Cause of Juche, Holding the Great Comrade Kim Jong Il in High Esteem as the Eternal General Secretary of Our Party'', 6 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialism of Our Style ===
Socialism of Our Style, also referred to as Korean-style socialism and our-style socialism within North Korea, is an ideological concept Kim Jong-il introduced on 27 December 1990 in the speech "Socialism of Our Country is a Socialism of Our Style as Embodied by the ''Juche'' idea".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}} Speaking after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] that brought down the [[Eastern Bloc]] regimes, Kim Jong-il explicitly stated that North Korea needed—and survived because of—Socialism of Our Style.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}} He argued that socialism in Eastern Europe failed because they "imitated the Soviet experience in a mechanical manner".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}} According to Kim, they failed to understand that the Soviet experience was based on specific historical and social circumstances and could not be used by other countries aside from the Soviet Union itself.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}} He added that "if experience is considered absolute and accepted dogmatically it is impossible to build Socialism properly, as the times change and the specific situation of each country is different from another".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}} Kim Jong-il went on to criticize "dogmatic application" of Marxism–Leninism, stating:{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=91–92}} {{quote|Marxism–Leninism presented a series of opinions on building of Socialism and Communism, but it confined itself to presupposition and hypothesis owing to the limitations of the conditions of their ages and practical experiences [...] But many countries applied the principles of Marxist–Leninist [[Historical materialism|materialistic conception of history]] dogmatically, failing to advance revolution continually after the establishment of the socialist system.{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=91–92}}}}

North Korea would not encounter such difficulties because of the conceiving of ''Juche''.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} In his words, North Korea was "a backward, colonial semifeudal society" when the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Communists]] took over, but since the North Korean Communists did not accept [[Marxism]] because it was based on European [[capitalist]] experiences, or [[Leninism]], which was based on Russia's experience, they conceived of ''Juche''.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} Additionally, he believed the situation in North Korea was also more complex because of the American presence in South Korea.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} Thanks to Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il argued, the revolution had "put forward original lines and policies suited to our people's aspirations and the specific situation of our country".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} "The ''Juche'' idea is a revolutionary theory which occupies the highest stage of development of the revolutionary ideology of the working class", Kim Jong-il said, further stating that the originality and superiority of the ''Juche'' idea defined and strengthened Korean socialism.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} He then conceded by stating that Socialism of Our Style was "a man-centered Socialism", explicitly making a break with basic Marxist–Leninist thought, which argues that material forces are the driving force of historical progress, not people.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} Socialism of Our Style was presented as an organic sociopolitical theory, using the language of Marxism–Leninism, saying:{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92–93}} {{quote|The political and ideological might of the motive force of revolution is nothing but the power of single-hearted unity between the leader, the Party, and the masses. In our socialist society, the leader, the Party, and the masses throw in their lot with one another, forming a single socio-political organism. The consolidation of blood relations between the leader, the Party and the masses is guaranteed by the single ideology and united leadership.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92–93}}}}

=== "Great Leader" theory ===
Unlike Marxism–Leninism, which considers improvements in the material conditions of production and exchange as the driving force of historical progress (known as [[historical materialism]]), ''Juche'' considers human beings in general the driving force in history.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=4}} It is summarized as "the popular masses are placed in the center of everything, and the leader is the center of the masses".{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=4}} ''Juche'', North Korea maintains, is a "man-centered ideology" in which the "man is the master of everything and decides everything".{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=4}} In contrast to Marxist–Leninist thought in which people's decisions are inextricably linked to their relations to the [[means of production]] (a concept referred to as "[[relations of production]]"), in ''Juche'' thought man is independent and decides everything.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=4}} Just like Marxist–Leninist thought, ''Juche'' believes history is law-governed, but that it is only man who drives progress, stating that "the popular masses are the drivers of history".{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=5}} However, for the masses to be successful, they need a "Great Leader".{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=5}} Marxism–Leninism argues that the popular masses will lead (on the basis of their relation to production), but in North Korea the role of a Great Leader should be essential for leadership.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=6}} This theory allegedly helped Kim Il-sung establish a unitary, one-man rule over North Korea.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=6}}

The theory turns the Great Leader into an absolutist, supreme leader.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=7}} The [[working class]] is not to think for themselves, but instead to think through the Great Leader.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=7}} The Great Leader is the "top brain" (i.e. "mastermind") of the working class, meaning that he is the only legitimate representative of the working class.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=7}} Class struggle can be realized only through the Great Leader and difficult tasks in general and revolutionary changes in particular can be introduced only through and by the Great Leader.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=7}} In historical development, it is the Great Leader who is the leading force of the working class.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=7}} The Great Leader is also a flawless human being who never commits mistakes, who is always benevolent and who always rules for the masses.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=8}} The leader is incorruptible.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=8}} For the Great Leader system to function, a unitary ideological system must be in place.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=9}} In North Korea, that unitary ideological system is known as the [[Ten Principles for a Monolithic Ideological System]].{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=9}}

=== The "masses" ===
Unlike the [[Joseon dynasty]], where there was a huge gap between the upper and lower classes, North Korea had adopted the concept of a gathered-together "people". Instead of a strict social hierarchy, North Korea had in theory divided the union into three classes, namely peasant, worker and ''samuwon'' (intellectuals and professionals), where each was just as important as the other. The ''samuwon'' class consisted of clerks, small traders, bureaucrats, professors and writers. This was a unique class that was created to increase education and literacy of North Korea's population.

Normally, Communist nations would value only the farmers or laborers, thus in the Soviet Union the [[intelligentsia]] was not defined as an independent class of its own, but rather as a "social stratum" that recruited itself from members of almost all classes: [[proletariat]], [[petite bourgeoisie]] and [[bourgeoisie]]. However, a "peasant intelligentsia" was never mentioned. Correspondingly, the "proletarian intelligentsia" was exalted for bringing forth progressive scientists and Marxist theoreticians whereas the "bourgeois intelligentsia" was condemned for producing "bourgeois ideology", which were all non-Marxist worldviews. Language reforms followed revolutions more than once, such as the [[New Korean Orthography]] in North Korea (which failed due to [[Korean ethnic nationalism|Korean ethnic nationalist]] fears of precluding [[Korean unification]]), or the simplification of Chinese characters under [[Mao Zedong]] (a consequence of the divergent orthographic choices of [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]), or the [[Reforms of Russian orthography#The post-revolution reform|simplification of the Russian language after the 1917 revolution]] in Russia and consequent struggle against illiteracy, known in Soviet Russia as ''[[Likbez]]'' (''Likvidaciya Bezgramotnosti'', liquidation of illiteracy).

They believed in rapid industrialization through labor and in subjecting nature to human will. By restructuring social classes into a mass of people who are theoretically all equal, the North Korean government claimed it would be able to attain self-reliance or ''Juche'' in upcoming years. This is questionable, because the country suffers massive food shortages annually and is heavily dependent on foreign aid.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=404–05}}

=== ''Songun'' ===
{{main article|Songun}}
''Songun'' (literally "military-first policy") was first mentioned on 7 April 1997 in ''[[Rodong Shinmun]]'' under the headline "There Is a Victory for Socialism in the Guns and Bombs of the People's Army".{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=63}} It defined the military-centered thinking of the time by stating; "the revolutionary philosophy to safeguard our own style of socialism under any circumstances".{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=63}} The concept was credited to "Respected General Kim Jong-il".{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=63}} In a joint editorial on 16 June 1998 entitled "Our Party's Military-First Politics Will Inevitably Achieve Victory and Will Never Be Defeated" by ''[[Kulloja]]'' (the WPK theoretical magazine) and ''Rodong Sinmun'', it was stated that ''Songun'' meant "the leadership method under the principle of giving priority to the military and resolving the problems that may occur in the course of revolution and construction as well as establishing the military as the main body of the revolution in the course of achieving the total tasks of socialism".{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=64}} While the article clearly referred to "our Party", this was not a reference to the WPK but rather to the personal leadership of Kim Jong-il.{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=64}} On 5 September 1998, the [[Constitution of North Korea|North Korean Constitution]] was revised and it made clear that the [[National Defence Commission]], the highest military body, was the supreme body of the state.{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=64}} This date is considered the beginning of the ''Songun'' era.{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=64}}

== ''Juche'' in practice ==
In the view of some observers, ''Juche'' is not mere rhetoric, but rather an ideal of self-reliance that North Korea has attempted to put into practice.{{sfn|Cumings|1997|p=419}}{{sfn|Abt|2014|pp=62–63}}&lt;ref name="Bluth"&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea|last=Bluth|first=Christoph|year=2008|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-07456-3357-2|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diplomacy ===
Based ''On the Juche Idea'', Kim Jong-il argued: "Independence is not in conflict with internationalism but is the basis of its strengthening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that North Korea co-operated with "socialist countries", the "international communist movement" and "newly-emerging nations" on the basis of non-interference, equality and mutual benefit.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea emerged from Soviet occupation and fought alongside the Chinese Communists in the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Korean War]]. However, it soon asserted its independence from both the Soviet Union and China. Though it rejected [[de-Stalinization]], it avoided taking sides in the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. As the [[Communist bloc]] split, introduced market reforms and collapsed, North Korea increasingly emphasized ''Juche'' in both theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hyung Gu Lynn |date= 2007 |title= Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 |publisher= Zed Books |pp=105–07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael E Robinson |date= 2007 |title= Korea's Twentieth Century Odyssey |publisher= University of Hawaii Books |pp=159–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buzo"&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea was admitted to the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1975 and began to present itself as a leader of the [[Third World]]. It fostered diplomatic relations with developing countries and promoted ''Juche'' as a model for others to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armstrong |first=Charles |title=Juche_and_North_Koreas_Global_Aspirations |journal=NKIDP Working Paper |date=April 2009 |issue=1 |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/NKIDP_Working_Paper_1_Juche_and_North_Koreas_Global_Aspirations_web.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307074422/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/NKIDP_Working_Paper_1_Juche_and_North_Koreas_Global_Aspirations_web.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=The DPRK Diplomatic Relations |last1=Wertz |first1=Daniel |last2=Oh |first2=JJ |last3=Kim |first3=Insung |year=2015 |publisher=National Committee on North Korea |url=http://www.ncnk.org/resources/publications/NCNK_Issue_Brief_DPRK_Diplomatic_Relations.pdf |p=1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085503/http://www.ncnk.org/resources/publications/NCNK_Issue_Brief_DPRK_Diplomatic_Relations.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===
In ''On the Juche Idea'', Kim Jong-il stated: "In order to implement the principle of economic self-sufficiency, one must build an independent national economy".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; More specifically, he stated, "Heavy industry with the machine-building industry as its backbone is the pillar of an independent national economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasized the importance of technological independence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-sufficiency in resources.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he stated that this did not rule out international economic co-operation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 1956, Kim Il-sung declared ''Juche'' to be the guiding principle of the economy. After the devastation of the Korean War, North Korea began to rebuild its economy with a base in heavy industry, with the aim of becoming as self-sufficient as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea| last = Bluth | first = Christoph | year = 2008| publisher = Polity Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-07456-3357-2 |pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, North Korea developed what has been called the "most [[autarky|autarkic]] industrial economy in the world".{{sfn|Cumings|1997|p=419}}&lt;ref name="Michael E Robinson"&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael E Robinson |date= 2007 |title= Korea's Twentieth Century Odyssey |publisher= University of Hawaii Books |p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea received a lot of economic aid and technical assistance from the Soviet Union and China, but it did not join [[Comecon]], the Communist common market.{{sfn|Cumings|1997|p=420}}&lt;ref name="Bluth"/&gt; In the 1990s, it had one of the world's lowest rates for dependence on petroleum, using hydroelectric power and coal instead of imported oil.{{sfn|Cumings|1997|p=426}} Its textile industry uses [[vinylon]], known as the "''Juche'' fiber", which was invented by a Korean and which is made from locally available coal and limestone.{{sfn|Abt|2014|p=39}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hyung Gu Lynn |date= 2007 |title= Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 |publisher= Zed Books |pp=134–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the development of vinylon often featured in propaganda that preached the virtues of technological self-reliance.&lt;ref name="Michael E Robinson"/&gt; North Korea had 10,000 [[CNC]] machines in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/m/read.php?cataId=nk01300&amp;num=6136|title=Vinylon and CNC?

Commentators have often pointed out the discrepancy between the principle of self-sufficiency and North Korea's dependence on foreign aid, especially during its economic crisis in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hyung Gu Lynn |date= 2007 |title= Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 |publisher= Zed Books |p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit of economic autarky has been blamed for contributing to the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |pp=147–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, attempts at self-sufficiency led to inefficiency and to the neglect of export opportunities in industries where there was a [[comparative advantage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jager | first = Sheila Miyoshi | title = Brothers at War – The Unending Conflict in Korea | year = 2013 | publisher = Profile Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84668-067-0|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defense ===
In ''On the Juche Idea'', Kim Jong-il stated: "Self-reliance in defense is a fundamental principle of an independent sovereign state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that it was possible to get aid from friends and allies, but that this would be effective only if the state was militarily strong in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated a state where "all the people are under arms and the whole country becomes a fortress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocated the development of a local defense industry to avoid dependence on foreign arms suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea has attempted to put this into practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Korean People's Army]] is one of the largest on earth.

== Religious features of ''Juche'' ==
Some South Korean scholars categorize ''Juche'' as a national religion or they compare its facets to those of some [[religion]]s. For instance, ''Juche'' has been compared to pre-existing religions in Korea (notably [[neo-Confucianism]] and [[Korean shamanism]]) due to their shared familiar principles.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=95}} While the influence of traditional [[East Asia]]n religions on ''Juche'' is widely disputed, the ideology has been thought of by several academic studies as having aspects of a national and indigenous religious movement in addition to being a political philosophy due to the following features: the presence of a sacred leader, rituals and familism.&lt;ref name="Scarecrow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoare|first1=James|title=Historical Dictionary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow|location=Lanham, MD|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the religious features of ''Juche'', it is a highly [[atheistic]] ideology that discourages the practice of mainstream religions. This draws from ''Juche''{{'}}s Marxist−Leninist origins. North Korea is officially an [[State atheism|atheist state]], but maintains a [[cult of personality]] identical to a religion, much like the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]].

=== Presence of a Sacred Leader ===
Although the ideology appears to emphasize the central role of the human individual, ''Juche'' can be fulfilled only through the masses’ subordination to a single leader and accordingly, his successor. The ideology teaches that the role of a Great Leader is essential for the popular masses to succeed in their revolutionary movement because without leadership they are unable to survive.{{sfn|Helgesen|1991|p=205}} This is the foundation of [[North Korean cult of personality]] surrounding Kim Il Sung. The personality cult explains how the ''Juche'' ideology has been able to endure until today, even during the North Korean government's undeniable dependence on foreign assistance during [[North Korean famine|its famine]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Scarecrow"/&gt; The concept of the "Sacred leader" in ''Juche'' as well as the cult around the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]] has been compared to the [[State Shinto]] ideology of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in which the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] was seen as a [[Imperial cult|divine being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/2015/02/north-koreas-kim-family-cult-roots-in-state-shinto/|title=North Korea’s Kim family cult: Roots in Japanese state Shinto?|last=Halpin|first=Dennis|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the fundamental belief in the essential role of the Great Leader, the former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung has become the "supreme deity for the people" and the ''Juche'' doctrine is reinforced in North Korea's constitution as the country’s guiding principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cumings|first1=Bruce|title=North Korea: Another Country|date=2003|publisher=New|location=New York|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel relationship structure between Kim Il-sung and his people to religious founders or leaders and their followers has led many scholars to consider ''Juche'' a religious movement as much as a political ideology.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=95}} However, those familiar with cults would again posit that ''Juche'' bypasses the tenants of religion completely and instead meets the criteria of a totalitarian cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomofmind.com/north-korea-hopefully-not-a-potential-global-waco/|title=North Korea: Hopefully Not a Potential Global Waco? - Freedom of Mind Resource Center|date=20 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Juche'''s emphasis on the political and sacred role of the leader and the ensuing worshipping by the popular masses has been critiqued by various intellectual [[Marxism|Marxists]].{{sfn|Helgesen|1991|p=205}} They argue that the North Korean working class or the proletariat has been stripped of their honor and therefore call the cult of personality non-Marxist and non-democratic.{{sfn|Helgesen|1991|p=206}}

=== Rituals ===
The religious behavior of ''Juche'' can also be seen in the perspectives of the North Korean people through refugee interviews from former participants in North Korea’s ritual occasions. One pertinent example is the [[Arirang Festival]], which is a gymnastics and artistic festival held in the [[Rungnado May Day Stadium]] in Pyongyang. All components of the festival, from the selection of performers, mobilization of resources, recruitment of the audience and publicity for the show have been compared to facets of a national religious event.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=101}}

The Arirang Festival has been described to demonstrate the power of the North Korean government to arrange a form of religious gathering. It has done so by "appropriating a mass of bodies for calisthenic and performative arts representing the leader as the Father and his faithful followers".{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=96}} The Festival's effectiveness in transforming its participants into loyal disciples of ''Juche'' seems to originate from the [[Collectivism|collectivist principle]] of "one for all and all for one" and the ensuing emotional bond and loyalty to the leader.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=96}} According to the accounts of refugees who have been recruited to mass gymnastics, the collectivist principle has been nurtured through physical punishment such as beatings and more importantly the organization of recruits into small units, whose performances were held accountable by larger units.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=111}} The Festival’s ritualistic components of collectivism serve to reinforce a "certain structure of sociality and affect", establishing Kim Il Sung as the "Father" in both the body and psyche of the performers.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=96}}

=== Familism ===
[[Charles K. Armstrong]] argues that familism has transformed itself into a kind of political religion in the form of ''Juche''. With the emergence of ''Juche'' as North Korea's guiding political principle since the 1960s, the familial relationship within the micro-family unit has been translated into a national, macro-unit with Kim Il-sung representing the father figure and the North Korean people representing his children. ''Juche'' is thus based on the language of family relationships with its East Asian or neo-Confucian "resonances of filial piety and maternal love".{{sfn|Armstrong|2005|p=383}}

[[File:Tributestojuche.jpg|thumb|150px|North Korea claims that the ''Juche'' idea has a wide international following which displays tributes from other socialist movements towards the idea in the entrance hall of the [[Juche Tower|''Juche'' Tower]]]]
Armstrong also notes that North Korea has actually transferred the "[[filial piety]] of nationalism in the family of the leader himself" by positioning Kim Il-sung as the universal [[patriarch]].{{sfn|Armstrong|2005|p=389}} He argues that while the official pursuit of the ''Juche'' ideology in the 1960s signaled North Korea's desire to separate from the "fraternity of international socialism", the ideology also replaced Stalin as the father figure with Kim Il-sung.{{sfn|Armstrong|2005|p=390}} In effect, North Korea's familial nationalism has supplanted the "rather abstract, class-oriented language of socialism with a more easily understandable and identifiable language of familial connections, love and obligations".{{sfn|Armstrong|2005|p=384}}

The cult of personality surrounding Kim expanded into a family cult when Kim Jong Il became the heir apparent after assuming important posts in the WPK and military in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim's Son 'Only One' to Take Over|agency=[[South China Morning Post]] &amp; the Hongkong Telegraph|issue=12|date=20 April 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong calls this a "family romance", which is a term Freud had used to describe "the neurotic replacement of a child's real parents with fantasy substitutes".{{sfn|Armstrong|2005|p=385}} Through the establishment of the North Korean family romance with the language, symbols and rituals related to familism, Kim Il Sung has been consecrated even further posthumously as the Great Father.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=95}}

== Criticism ==
Throughout the 1990s, the North Korean regime became increasingly nationalistic—at least, in its official pronouncements—leading Kim Chonghun to state that "Socialism of our Style" was really "Socialism without Socialism".{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=91–94}} Speeches and official announcements made references to socialism, but neither to Marxist–Leninist thought nor to any basic communist concepts.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=93}} Shin Gi-wook argues that "there is no trace of Marxist–Leninism or the Stalinist notion of nationhood [in North Korea]. Instead, Kim stresses the importance of the Korean people's blood, soul and national traits, echoing earlier Korean nationalists such as [[Sin Chaeho]], Yi Kwangsu and [[Choe Namson]]. He no longer has any interest in applying Marxism–Leninism to the North Korean situation; indeed it is no longer useful for the country".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=93}}

[[Charles K. Armstrong]] says that "North Korean Communism would not only be quite distinctive from the Soviet model, it would in some respects turn Marxism–Leninism upside-down".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=94}} The key differences are that the North Koreans place the primacy of ideology over materialism, retaining the vocabulary of family lineage and nationalism and giving it primacy over [[Class conflict|class struggle]] and supporting social distinction and hierarchy over classless society and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=94}} He concluded that North Korea may look "Stalinist in form", but that it was "nationalist in content".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=94}}

[[Brian Reynolds Myers]] dismisses the idea that ''Juche'' is North Korea's leading ideology, regarding its public exaltation as designed to deceive foreigners. He argues that it exists to be praised and not actually read.&lt;ref name="Rank"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/LD10Dg02.html |title=Lifting the cloak on North Korean secrecy: ''The Cleanest Race, How North Koreans See Themselves'' by B R Myers |first=Michael |last=Rank |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2012 |publisher=Asia Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his own experiences living in North Korea, [[Felix Abt]] describes Myers' arguments as "shaky" and "questionable". Having seen the extent to which North Korean university students actually believe in ''Juche'', Abt says it is "rather absurd" to describe the ideology as "window-dressing" for foreigners. He also questions how only three decades of Japanese occupation could simply upend the impact of "thousands of years" of history in Korea.{{sfn|Abt|2014|pp=62–63}}

[[Dae-Sook Suh]] has stated that Kim-Il Sung had failed to explain the difference between [[Socialist patriotism]] and nationalism which Kim stated he opposed. Suh also criticised Kim for allegedly failing to explain how Marxism–Leninism has been applied to Korean conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Il-Sung: The North Korean Leader&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1205">A '''kaross''' is a [[cloak]] made of [[sheepskin]], or the hide of other animals, with the hair left on. It is properly confined to the coat of skin without sleeves and used to be worn by the [[Khoikhoi]] and [[Bushmen|Bushmen / San]] peoples of [[South Africa]]. These karosses became replaced by a blanket. Their chiefs wore karosses of the skin of the wild cat, [[leopard]] or [[caracal]]. The word is also loosely applied to the cloaks of leopard-skin worn by the chiefs and principal men of several southern African tribes. Kaross is probably either a genuine Khoikhoi word, or else an adaptation of the Dutch kuras ({{lang-pt|couraça}}), a cuirass. In a vocabulary dated 1673 "karos" is described as a "corrupt Dutch word."

These days the kaross is a common tourist item, being made of various animal hides including cowhide. The term is loosely applied in modern times to fur blankets sold as bedding. These "karosses" often have panels of different types of animal fur sewn into them in order to make a decorative pattern.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

A '''latte stone''', or simply '''latte''' (also '''latde''' or '''latti'''), is a [[Column|pillar]] ([[Chamorro language]]: ''haligi'') capped by a [[Sphere|hemispherical]] stone [[capital (architecture)|capital]] (''tasa'') with the flat side facing up.  Used as building supports by the ancient [[Chamorro people]], they are found throughout most of the [[Mariana Islands]]. In modern times, the latte stone is seen as a sign of Chamorro identity and is used in many different contexts.

== Construction ==
[[Image:Taga Latte Stone Quarry, Rota.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Rota Latte Stone Quarry|latte quarry]] on [[Rota (island)|Rota]] has several partially cut stones]]
Latte stones have been made of [[limestone]], [[basalt]], or [[sandstone]].  Typical pillars range in height from 60 centimeters to three meters, and generally narrow towards the top.&lt;ref name=Guampedia&gt;{{cite web |first= John L.|last= Craib|url= http://guampedia.com/contents-of-a-latte-village |title= Contents of a Latte Village |accessdate= Jan 11, 2015|year= 2014|work= Guampedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pillar was normally quarried and then transported to the construction site.  For small to medium-sized lattes, the capstone was a large hemispherical [[coral]] head that was gathered from a [[reef]].  The massive capstones found in [[Rota (island)|Rota]] were instead quarried, like the pillars.&lt;ref name=ns&gt;{{cite web |first= Rudolph |last= Villaverde |url= http://ns.gov.gu/latte.html |title= From the Ancient Past: The Latte Stones of Guam |work= Guam Ultimate Guide |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051029211302/http://ns.gov.gu/latte.html |archivedate= 2005-10-29 |df=  }}{{self-published source|date= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Oceania]] the latte stone is unique to the Marianas, though [[megalith]]s of differing construction and purpose are common to Oceanic cultures.  Similarities between the latte stone and the wood posts made by the [[Ifugao]] sub-group of the [[Igorot]] in the [[Philippines]], on which they build rice stores, have been pointed out.  The rounded capstones help prevent rats from climbing up the pillar.  A similar wood post construction appears to be depicted in a relief carving at [[Borobodur]], [[Java]],&lt;ref name=Guampedia/&gt; which has caused one scholar to put forward the disputed theory of a prehistorical cultural exchange between the Marianas and Java.&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;

Latte stones varied greatly in size.  The smallest were several feet tall.  The largest latte still standing is 16 feet (5m) tall, located in [[Tinian]].  In [[Rota (island)|Rota]], quarried latte would have stood 25 feet (8m) high if erected.  The largest shaft found here weighs 34 [[ton]]s while the largest cap weighs 22 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carter |first1= Lee |first2= Rosa |last2= Carter |first3= William |last3= Wuerch |lastauthoramp= yes |year= 1997 |title= Guam History: Perspectives Volume One: MARC |isbn= 1-878453-28-9}}{{full|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the pre-contact Marianas is usually divided into three periods: Pre-Latte, Transitional Pre-Latte, and Latte.  Latte stones began to be used in about 800 A.D. and became increasingly more common until the arrival of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521 and Spanish colonization, when they fell rapidly out of use and were entirely abandoned by about 1700.  Latte stones have been found on [[Guam]] and the southern islands in the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]], including [[Rota Latte Stone Quarry (Mariana Islands)|Rota]], [[Tinian]], [[Aguijan]], and [[Saipan]], as well as several small northern islands, such as [[Pagan Island|Pagan]].&lt;ref name=Guampedia/&gt;

Undisturbed stones are found usually arranged in parallel pairs of between eight and fourteen lattes framing a rectangular space.&lt;ref name=Guampedia/&gt;  The more pairs in the structure, the taller the latte stones.&lt;ref name=Guampedia/&gt; One twenty latte arrangement was found in the current location of the military Ordnance Annex on southern Guam.&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;  While none of the early European visitors to the islands appear to have drawn pictures of latte stones in use, several Spanish accounts from the 16th and 17th centuries state that houses were erected on the stones, with one eyewitness specifying that the structures on lattes were used to shelter [[proa]]s and served as community meeting places.&lt;ref name=Guampedia/&gt;   However, the lack of definitive, consistent evidence means that all theories are disputed.  Some archaeologists believe that only high status Chamorros lived in structures built on latte stones, while others have put forward the theory that all Chamorros in the Latte Period lived in latte structures, and that the height and number of the stones in the structure indicated social status.&lt;ref name=Guampedia/&gt;  Other structures in a latte village, which may have included cooking huts, canoe houses and public houses for unmarried men,&lt;ref name=Guampedia/&gt; were built on the ground, typically in an [[A-frame]] of wood poles, often [[bamboo]], with [[thatched roof]]s of grass, [[coconut]] fronds or [[Nypa fruticans|Nipa]] fronds.&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;

== Cultural context ==
[[Image:Flag of the Northern Mariana Islands.svg|thumb|left|[[Flag of the Northern Mariana Islands]]]]
Archaeologists who have worked in the Marianas since the end of [[World War II]] have noted a distinct difference between latte stones located along the coast and those located inland.  Coastal latte tend to be placed in sand containing extensive relics of habitation, including shards of pottery, fish and animal bones, and stone and shell tools.  Human burials were placed within sand containing these archaeological remnants, either within or near sets of lattes.  In contrast, the soil in which inland latte stones are placed rarely has an archaeological stratum or associated burial.  The implication is that mainland latte sites were temporarily occupied, and perhaps that there was a change in burial practice in the later [[Latte Period]]{{clarify|date=November 2014}}&lt;!-- using "Latte Period" here as a proper noun really requires some sort of clarification --&gt;.&lt;ref name=Guampedia/&gt;

[[Image:University of Guam sign.jpg|thumb|The sign for the [[University of Guam]] is flanked by decorative latte stones]]
By the 18th and 19th centuries, travelers to the Marianas noted lattes only in abandoned areas, where they had apparently been left after foreign-introduced disease had decimated the Chamorro population.  In modern times, latte stones are a symbol of Chamorro identity and are found in a wide variety of government, business and personal contexts.  Concrete lattes are sometimes incorporated into new buildings, while residents of the Marianas will sometimes incorporate actual latte stones into the landscaping around their homes.&lt;ref name=Guampedia/&gt;

A latte stone features on the [[District of Columbia and United States Territories Quarters|US quarter coin]] for the Northern Marianas Islands. [[Highway shield]]s marking [[List of numbered highways in the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Mariana Islands highways]] superimpose the route number on a white outline of a latte stone.

'''Library history''' is a subdiscipline within [[library science]] and [[library and information science]] focusing on the history of libraries and their role in societies and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Anne L. &amp; Herubel, Jean-Pierre V. M. (2011). Subject and Historiographic Characteristics of Library History: Disciplinary considerations and scholarship. ''Journal of Scholarly Publishing'', 42(4), 503-522&lt;/ref&gt;   Some see the field as a subset of [[information history]]&lt;ref&gt;Black, A. (2006). Information history. ''[[Annual Review of Information Science and Technology]]'', 40 , 441-473.&lt;/ref&gt; Library history is an [[academic discipline]] and should not be confused with its object of study ([[history of libraries]]): the discipline is much younger than the libraries it studies. Library history begins in ancient societies through contemporary issues facing libraries today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stuart|title=The Library an illustrated history|year=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60239-706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Topics include recording mediums, cataloguing systems, scholars, scribes, library supporters and librarians.&lt;ref&gt;Hildenbrand, Suzanne, red. (1996). ''Reclaiming the American library past: Writing the women in'' Norwood, N.J.: Ablex. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest libraries==
The earliest records of a library institution as it is presently understood can be dated back to around 5,000 years ago in the Southwest Asian regions of the world. During the time, civilizations that began to keep records would do so by writing on mediums that ranged from clay tablets, bones, skin, bamboo, to papyrus. One of the oldest libraries found is that of the ancient library at [[Ebla]] (circa 2500 BCE) in present-day Syria. In the 1970s, the excavation at Ebla's library unearthed over 20,000 clay tablets written in [[cuneiform script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Basbanes|first1=Stuart A.P. Murray ; introduction by Donald G. Davis, Jr. ; foreword by Nicholas A.|title=The library : an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Al Qarawiyyin Library was founded in 859 by [[Fatima al-Fihri]] and is the oldest working library in the world. It is in [[Fez, Morocco]] and is part of the oldest continually operating university in the world, the [[University of al-Qarawiyyin]]. The library houses approximately 4,000 ancient Islamic manuscripts. These manuscripts include 9th century [[Quran|Qurans]] and the oldest known accounts of the Islamic prophet Muhammed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/inside-al-qarawiyyin-the-oldest-library-in-the-world-2016-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrian [[King Assurbanipal]] created one of the greatest libraries in [[Nineveh]] in the seventh century BCE. The collection consisted of over 30,000 tablets written in a variety of languages. The collection was cataloged both by the shape of the tablet and by the subject of the content (Murray, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;8-9).

The Greek government was the first to sponsor public libraries. By 500 BCE both Athens and Samos had begun creating libraries for the public, though as most of the population was illiterate these spaces were serving a small, educated portion of the community (Murray, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;14).

The library at [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandria]], Egypt, was renowned in the third century BCE while kings Ptolemy I Soter and Ptolemy II Philadelphus reigned. The library included a museum, garden, meeting areas and of course reading rooms (Lyons, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;26-27).&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. (2011). Books: a living history. Los Angeles, CA. Getty Publications. {{ISBN|978-1-60606-083-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Library, as it is known, was one of many in Alexandria. Beginning at its inception through the first century BCE Alexandria was a well known center for learning, the quantity and quality of the libraries speak to this renown (Murray, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;17).

It wasn't until the Middle Ages that libraries became a part of culture. During the Renaissance era, more people became educated and relied on libraries as a place to study and gain knowledge. During the Renaissance most of the text held in libraries were religious text. Libraries helped enrich the culture of those who were educated by providing this valuable resource otherwise unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/library/The-Middle-Ages-and-the-Renaissance&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library history reports and writings of the early 19th and 20th century==
In the early 19th and 20th century, representative titles were created reporting library history in the United States and the United Kingdom. American titles include: ''Public Libraries in the United States of America, Their History, Condition, and Management'' (1876), ''Memorial History of Boston'' (1881) by Justin Winsor, ''Public Libraries in America'' (1894) by William I. Fletcher, and ''History of the New York Public Library'' (1923) by Henry M. Lydenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=F. Williams|last2=Wiegand|first2=Wayne A.|editor1-last=Wiegand|editor1-first=Wayne A.|editor2-last=Davis, Jr.|editor2-first=Donald G.|title=Encyclopedia of Library History|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135787509|page=261|type=ebook|chapter=Historiography of Library History}}&lt;/ref&gt; British titles include: ''Old English Libraries'' (1911) by Earnest A. Savage and T''he Chained Library: A Survey of Four Centuries in the Evolution of the English Library'' by Burnett Hillman Streeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=F.

In the beginning of the 20th century, library historians began applying scientific research methodologies to examine the library as a social agency. Two works that demonstrate this argument are ''Geschichte der Bibliotheken'' (1925) by Alfred Hessel and the ''Library Quarterly'' article from 1931, “The Sociological Beginnings of the Library Movement in America” by Arnold Borden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=F. Williams|last2=Wiegand|first2=Wayne A.|editor1-last=Wiegand|editor1-first=Wayne A.|editor2-last=Davis, Jr.|editor2-first=Donald G.|title=Encyclopedia of Library History|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135787509|page=261|type=ebook|chapter=Historiography of Library History}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
With the establishment of library schools, master’s theses and doctoral dissertations represented the shift in serious research regarding libraries and library history. Two published doctoral dissertations that mark this trend are ''Foundations of the Public Library: The Origins of the American Public Library Movement in New England, 1629 – 1855'' (1940) by Jesse Shera and ''Arsenals of a Democratic Culture: A Social History of the American Public Library Movement in New England and the Middle Atlantic States From 1850 to 1900'' (1947).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=F.

Sharp'' by Laurel Grotzinger, a biographical study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=F.

==Cataloging==
The earliest methods of cataloging involved storing tablets separately based on their content. The subject matter was identified by small descriptions or 
color coding. Common practice was to have different rooms or chambers for the various subject types. Moving to the Renaissance period, cataloging took on a whole new level. Materials were still stored by content, but now titles were being listed and organized alphabetically. Catalogs were kept in ledger form listing all the materials in the collection, new additions added at the margins, until a librarian would redraft the catalog. Maintaining and revising the catalog became crucially important as collections grew. It was during the Renaissance period that one would find the first catalogs that referenced other collections to make finding materials easier. As printing grew, so did the need for accurate catalogs of material available. Additionally catalogs needed to be descriptive enough to help librarians in the locating and storing of books. As collections grew, so naturally did catalogs. Materials continued to be separated by subject and would then be further divided by more specific heading, still listed and stored within these sub headings alphabetically.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart. (2009). ''The Library: an Illustrated History''. [[Skyhorse Publishing]]: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">The '''marine reservoir effect''' is a phenomenon affecting [[radiocarbon dating]].  Because much of the carbon consumed by organisms in the ocean is older than that consumed by organisms on land, samples from marine life and from organisms that consumed a lot of sea-based foods while alive may appear older than they truly are when tested.&lt;ref name=Eureka&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiocarbon dating reveals mass grave did date to the Viking age|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-02/uob-rdr020118.php|author=University of Bristol|publisher=Eurekalert|date=February 2, 2018|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to account for changes in the Earth's oceans to correct for the marine reservoir effect.&lt;ref name=Ascough2005&gt;{{cite journal|title=Methodological approaches to determining the marine radiocarbon reservoir effect|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1191/0309133305pp461ra|author1=Philippa Ascough|author2=Gordon Cook| author3=Andrew Dugmore|volume=29|issue=4|pages=532-547|journal=Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment|doi=10.1191/0309133305pp461ra|date=December 1, 2005|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, affected radiocarbon dates appear c. 400 &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C years older than they would if unaffected. But the effect is highly variable in space and time, and can reach 800 to 1200 &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C years in Arctic regions.&lt;ref name=Ascough2005/&gt;

==Notable cases==

Since its initial discovery in the 1980s, a [[Viking]] burial site in England confounded archeologists.  It contained coins and other physical materials associated with the late 800s c.e., the time of the [[Great Danish Army]], but the radiocarbon dating placed the roughly 300 bodies within at a variety of different dates spanning centuries.  In February 2018, a team out of the [[University of Bristol]] published a study attributing this to the large amounts of sea-based foods eaten by Vikings and placed the burial site in the late 800s.&lt;ref name = Eureka&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UBristol&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/30DFE4A0D5581DEBC8B43096A37985EE/S0003598X1700196Xa.pdf/viking_great_army_in_england_new_dates_from_the_repton_charnel.pdf|title=The Viking Great Army in England: new dates from the Repton charnel|author1=Catrine L.

'''Medical fetishism''' refers to a number of [[sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]] involving objects, practices, environments, and situations of a medical or clinical nature. In [[sexual roleplay]] a hospital or medical scene involves the [[sex partners]] assuming the roles of doctors, nurses, surgeons and patients to act out specific or general medical fetishes. Medical fantasy is a genre in [[pornography]], though the fantasy may not necessarily involve pornography or sexual activity.

Medical fetishism may involve sexual attraction to [[respiratory therapy]] involving oxygen via nasal cannula or any sort of masks, [[medical practitioner]]s, [[medical uniform]]s, [[hospital gowns]],  [[anaesthesia]], [[intimate examination]]s (such as [[rectal examination]], [[gynecology|gynecological examination]], [[urology|urological examination]], [[andrology|andrological examination]], [[thermometer#Medical thermometer|rectal temperature-taking]]), [[catheterization]], [[diaper]]ing, [[enema]]s, [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]s, insertion (such as [[suppository]] insertion, [[Menstrual cup|menstrual-cup]] insertion, and [[prostatic massage]]), [[medical device]]s (such as [[orthopedic cast]]s and [[Brace (orthopaedic)|orthopedic brace]]s; see also "[[Abasiophilia]]"), [[dentistry|dental]] objects (such as [[dental braces]], [[retainer (orthodontic device)|retainers]], and [[orthodontic headgear|headgear]]), [[medical restraint]]s, and [[medical gag]]s.

== Physical examination ==
[[File:Kink.com photo shoot.jpg|thumb|The film set for a medical fetishism scene]]
Some people eroticize about intimate examinations as part of a medical fetish, and as such are a common service offered by [[professional dominant]]s.

An intimate examination can form part of a scene in medical play where the nurse or doctor inflicts one or more embarrassing and humiliating quasi-medical procedures on the patient. Often frozen or heated objects are introduced to the patient's body to simulate the uncomfortable sensations that can occur during a real examination. Examinations may include an examination and intrusion of the anus, urethra, or vagina, as well as handling and twisting of the penis, testicles, clitoris, and nipples. Quite often, strap on play is also incorporated, as this can heighten the intimacy, and also the sensations of the patient. This may be a prelude to masturbation or administration of an enema. Before examination, the patient can be placed in [[Bondage (sexual)|physical restraints]] and [[gag (BDSM)|gag]]ged, and wear some form of embarrassing clothing.

== Temperature-taking fetish ==
'''Temperature taking fetish''' is a sexual fetish for [[Thermometer|oral thermometers and rectal thermometers]]. This may include the sexual attraction to the equipment, processes, environments or scenarios/situations. Sexual arousal from the desire to take another's temperature or have one's temperature taken is primarily what surrounds the fetish.  While rectal temperature taking is more prominent, there is also an interest in oral temperature taking.

== Anesthesia fetishism ==
'''Anesthesia fetishism''' is a sexual fetish for [[anesthesia]]. This may include the sexual attraction to the equipment, processes, substances, effects, environments or situations. Sexual arousal from the desire to administer anesthesia, or the sexual desire for oneself to be anesthetized are two forms in which an individual may exist as an arbiter of the fetish. Older-style anesthesia masks of black rubber, still in occasional use today, are one of the more common elements fetishized, and have earned the nickname ''Black Beauty'' by many fetishists.

=== Acts, behaviour and rituals ===
Anesthesia fetish is considered [[edgeplay]] when realised outside the boundaries of fantasy, and may result in various degrees of harm, or death. [[fantasy (psychology)|Fantasies]] are elaborated by the viewing of images and reading of stories of anesthetic inductions. [[Edgeplay]] may involve obtaining and [[Scene (BDSM)|scening]] with various anesthesia-related paraphernalia—usually anesthesia masks for [[breathplay]], the acquisition of anesthetics for anesthetizing others or being anesthetized oneself, and the occupation of a medical setting or environment for the same practice.

Some anesthesia fetishists who seek to be anesthetized may feign or induce medical conditions in an attempt to obtain general anesthesia from medical personnel. This is considered safer than playing with anesthetic agents outside of a medical setting, but may nevertheless be an abuse of all concerned.

=== Internet influence ===
The [[Internet]] has enabled people with this relatively rare [[paraphilia]] to discuss the subject and exchange anesthesia-related [[multimedia]].{{cn|date=December 2014}}

'''Merlin''' ({{lang-cy|Myrddin}}) is a legendary figure best known as the [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] featured in [[Arthurian legend]] and [[medieval Welsh poetry]]. The standard depiction of the character first appears in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', written c. 1136, and is based on an amalgamation of previous historical and legendary figures. Geoffrey combined existing stories of [[Myrddin Wyllt]] (or Merlinus Caledonensis), a [[Hen Ogledd|North Brythonic]] [[prophet]] and madman with no connection to [[King Arthur]], with tales of the [[Romano-British]] war leader [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] to form the composite figure he called '''Merlin Ambrosius''' ({{lang-cy|Myrddin Emrys}}). 

Geoffrey's rendering of the character was immediately popular, especially in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd-Morgan, Ceridwen. "Narratives and Non-Narrtives: Aspects of Welsh Arthurian Tradition." ''Arthurian Literature''. 21. (2004): 115–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers expanded the account to produce a fuller image of the wizard. Merlin's traditional biography casts him as a [[cambion]]: born of a mortal woman, sired by an [[incubus]], the non-human from whom he inherits his supernatural powers and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katharine Mary Briggs]] (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', p.440. New York: Pantheon Books. {{ISBN|0-394-73467-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merlin matures to an ascendant sagehood and engineers the birth of Arthur through magic and intrigue.&lt;ref name="thorpe"&gt;{{cite book| author = Geoffrey of Monmouth| authorlink = Geoffrey of Monmouth| title = [[Historia Regum Britanniae|The History of the Kings of Britain]]| series = Penguin Classics| year = 1977| publisher = [[Penguin Books]]| isbn = 0-14-044170-0| editor = [[Lewis Thorpe]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later authors have Merlin serve as the king's advisor and mentor to the knights until he is bewitched and forever imprisoned or killed by the [[Lady of the Lake]].&lt;ref name="thorpe" /&gt; He is popularly said to be buried in the magical forest of [[Brocéliande]].

== Name and etymology ==
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 138r 5.jpg|thumb|upright|left| Merlin in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493)]]

The name "Merlin" is derived from the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''[[Myrddin]]'', the name of the [[bard]] who was one of the chief sources for the later legendary figure. [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinised]] the name to '''Merlinus''' in his works. Medievalist [[Gaston Paris]] suggests that Geoffrey chose the form ''Merlinus'' rather than the regular ''Merdinus'' to avoid a resemblance to the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] word ''merde'' (from [[Latin]] ''merda'') for [[feces]].&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|authorlink=|year=2008|title=Merlin|journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|volume=|issue=|pages=|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00306349?query_type=word&amp;queryword=merlin&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=2&amp;search_id=0h1m-im2NWy-2375&amp;hilite=00306349|accessdate=June 7, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110629011419/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00306349?query_type=word&amp;queryword=merlin&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=2&amp;search_id=0h1m-im2NWy-2375&amp;hilite=00306349|archivedate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clas Myrddin]] or ''Merlin's Enclosure'' is an early name for [[Great Britain]] stated in the Third Series of [[Welsh Triads]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rhys|Rhys, John]]: ''[[Hibbert Lectures]]'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Celticist A. O. H. Jarman suggests that the Welsh name ''{{lang|cy|Myrddin}}'' ({{IPA-cy|ˈmərðɪn}}) was derived from the toponym ''Caerfyrddin'', the Welsh name for the town known in English as [[Carmarthen]].&lt;ref name="Koch321"&gt;Koch, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the popular [[folk etymology]] that the town was named for the bard. The name Carmarthen is derived from the town's previous [[Roman Empire|Roman]] name [[Moridunum (Carmarthen)|Moridunum]],&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch321/&gt; in turn derived from Celtic [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''moridunon'', "sea fortress".&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Noms de lieux celtiques de l'Europe ancienne'', Errance, Paris, 2012 (French)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geoffrey and his sources ==
Geoffrey's composite Merlin is based primarily on the legendary "madman" poet and seer [[Myrddin Wyllt]] ("Myrddin the Wild", sometimes called ''Merlinus Caledonensis'' in later sources influenced by Geoffrey), and ''Emrys'' ([[Old Welsh|Old Welsh:]] ''Embreis''), a fictional character based in part on the 5th century, historical war leader [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] mentioned in one of Geoffrey's primary sources, the early 9th century [[Historia Brittonum|''Historia Brittonum'']].&lt;ref&gt;Ashe, Geoffrey. ''The Discovery of Arthur'', Owl Books, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The former had nothing to do with [[King Arthur]]: in British poetry he was a bard driven mad after witnessing the horrors of war, who fled civilization to become a [[wild man|wild man of the wood]] in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dames, Michael. ''Merlin and Wales: A Magician's Landscape'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey had ''Myrddin Wyllt'' in mind when he wrote his earliest surviving work, the ''[[Prophetiae Merlini]]'' (''Prophecies of Merlin''), which he claimed were the actual words of the legendary poet and madman.

[[File:Cotton Claudius B VII f.224 Merlin Vortigern.jpg|thumb|left|Merlin reads his prophecies to [[King Vortigern]] in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Prophetiae Merlini]]'' (c. 1250-1270)]]

Geoffrey's ''Prophetiae'' do not reveal much about Merlin's background. He included the prophet in his next work, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', supplementing the characterisation by attributing to him stories about Aurelius Ambrosius, taken from [[Nennius]]' ''Historia Brittonum''. According to Nennius, Ambrosius was discovered when the British king [[Vortigern]] was trying to erect a tower. The tower always collapsed before completion, and his wise men told him that the only solution was to sprinkle the foundation with the blood of a child born without a father. Ambrosius was rumoured to be such a child but, when brought before the king, he revealed the real reason for the tower's collapse: below the foundation was a lake containing two dragons who fought a battle representing the struggle between the invading [[Saxons]] and the native [[Celtic Britons]]. Geoffrey retells this story in his ''Historia Regum Britanniæ'' with some embellishments, and gives the fatherless child the name of the prophetic bard Merlin. He keeps this new figure separate from Aurelius Ambrosius and, with regard to his changing of the original Nennian character, he states that Ambrosius was also called 'Merlin'—that is, 'Ambrosius Merlinus'. He goes on to add new episodes that tie Merlin with King Arthur and his predecessors.

[[File:BLEgerton3028Fol30rStonehengeCropped.jpg|thumb|A giant helps Merlin build [[Stonehenge]] in a manuscript of [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]'' (c. 1325-1350)]]

Geoffrey's account of Merlin Ambrosius' early life in the ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' is based on the tale of Ambrosius in the ''Historia Brittonum''. He adds his own embellishments to the tale, which he sets in [[Carmarthen]], Wales (Welsh: [[Caerfyrddin]]). While Nennius' Ambrosius eventually reveals himself to be the son of a Roman [[consul]], Geoffrey's Merlin is begotten on a king's daughter by an [[incubus]] demon. (The name of Merlin's mother is not usually stated, but is given as Adhan in the oldest version of the [[Brut Chronicle|Prose ''Brut'']].&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliographical Bulletin of the Arthurian Society'' Vol LIX (2007) p 108, item 302.&lt;/ref&gt;) The story of Vortigern's tower is essentially the same; the underground dragons, one white and one red, represent the Saxons and the Britons, and their final battle is a portent of things to come. At this point Geoffrey inserts a long section of Merlin's prophecies, taken from his earlier ''Prophetiae Merlini''. He tells only two further tales of the character. In the first, Merlin creates [[Stonehenge]] as a burial place for Aurelius Ambrosius, bringing the stones from the [[Preseli Hills]] in south-west Wales and Ireland. In the second, Merlin's magic enables the new British king [[Uther Pendragon]] to enter into [[Tintagel]] in disguise and father his son Arthur with his enemy's wife, [[Igraine]]. These episodes appear in many later adaptations of Geoffrey's account. As [[Lewis Thorpe]] notes, Merlin disappears from the narrative after this; he does not tutor and advise Arthur as in later versions.&lt;ref name="thorpe" /&gt;

Geoffrey dealt with Merlin again in his third work, ''[[Vita Merlini]]''. He based it on stories of the original 6th-century Myrddin, set long after his time frame for the life of Merlin Ambrosius. Geoffrey tried to assert that the characters are the same with references to King Arthur and his death, as told in the ''Historia Regum Britanniae''. Here, Merlin survives Arthur, is married to a woman named Guendoloena, and spends his time observing stars from his home with seventy windows in the remote woods in the land of [[Rhydderch Hael|Rhydderch]], where he is often visited by his beautiful sister Ganieda (based on Myrddin's sister Gwendydd) who has become queen of the [[Cumbrians]].

[[Nikolai Tolstoy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tolstoy|first1=Nikolai|title=The Quest for Merlin|date=1985|publisher=Hamish Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesizes that Merlin is based on a historical personage, probably a 6th-century [[druid]] living in southern Scotland. His argument is based on the fact that early references to Merlin describe him as possessing characteristics which modern scholarship (but not that of the time the sources were written) would recognize as druidical—the inference being that those characteristics were not invented by the early chroniclers, but belonged to a real person. If so, the hypothetical Merlin would have lived about a century after the hypothetical historical Arthur. A late version of the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' (dubbed the "B-text", written at the end of the 13th century) and influenced by Geoffrey,&lt;ref&gt;Curley, Michael, ''Geoffrey of Monmouth'', Cengage Gale, 1994, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; records for the year 573, that after "the [[battle of Arfderydd]], between the sons of Eliffer and Gwenddolau son of Ceidio; in which battle Gwenddolau fell; Merlin went mad." The earliest version of the ''Annales Cambriae'' entry (in the "A-text", written c. 1100), as well as a later copy (the "C-text", written towards the end of the 13th century) do not mention Merlin.&lt;ref&gt;Gough-Cooper, Henry (2012). "[http://www.heroicage.org/issues/15/gough-cooper.php Annales Cambriae, from Saint Patrick to AD 682: Texts A, B &amp; C in Parallel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515221958/http://www.heroicage.org/issues/15/gough-cooper.php |date=2013-05-15 }}". ''The Heroic Age'', Issue 15 (October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later versions of the legend ==
[[File:Histoire de Merlin.png|thumb|left|350px|The story of Merlin's unholy birth as told in the 13th-century's prose version of ''[[Merlin (poem)|Merlin]]'' in an illumination by [[Jean Colombe]] (c. 1480-1485)]]

Several decades later, [[Robert de Boron]] retold and expanded on this material in his poem ''[[Merlin (poem)|Merlin]]'' written around 1200. Only a few lines of the poem have survived, but a prose retelling became popular and was later incorporated into [[chivalric romance]]s. In Robert's account, as in Geoffrey's ''Historia'', Merlin is begotten by a demon on a virgin as the intended [[Antichrist]]. This plot is thwarted when the expectant mother informs her confessor Blaise of her predicament; they immediately baptize the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny. The demonic legacy invests Merlin with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives the boy a prophetic knowledge of the future. Robert lays great emphasis on Merlin's power to [[shapeshift]],{{#tag:ref|He appears as a woodcutter with an axe about his neck, big shoes, a torn coat, bristly hair, and a large beard. He is later found in the forest of [[Northumberland]] by a follower of Uther's disguised as an ugly man and tending a great herd of beasts. He then appears first as a handsome man and then as a beautiful boy. Years later, he approaches Arthur disguised as a peasant wearing leather boots, a wool coat, a hood, and a belt of knotted sheepskin. He is described as tall, black and bristly, and as seeming cruel and fierce. Finally, he appears as an old man with a long beard, short and hunchbacked, in an old torn woolen coat, who carries a club and drives a multitude of beasts before him.&lt;ref name="loomis" /&gt;|group="note"}} on his joking personality, and on his connection to the [[Holy Grail]], the quest for which he foretells. Robert was inspired by [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]'', an Anglo-Norman adaptation of Geoffrey's ''Historia''. ''Merlin'' was originally a part of a cycle of Robert's poems, which tells the story of the Grail that gathered the blood of Christ: brought to Britain by followers of [[Joseph of Arimathea]], the Grail is eventually recovered by Arthur's knight [[Percival]]. 

Robert's poem was rewritten and continued in prose in the 13th century as the ''Estoire de Merlin'', also called the Vulgate ''Merlin ''or Prose ''Merlin''. It is a part of the vast [[Lancelot-Grail]]'','' also known as the Vulgate Cycle, where (in the Prose ''Lancelot'') it is said that Merlin actually was never baptized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=2a22CNzigcAC&amp;pg=PA101|title=Heroes and Anti-heroes in Medieval Romance|last=Cartlidge|first=Neil|date=2012|publisher=DS Brewer|isbn=9781843843047|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was further expanded with the [[Post-Vulgate]] ''Suite du Merlin'' (also known as ''Merlin Continuation'' or the Huth ''Merlin''), which describes King Arthur's many early wars and the role of Merlin in them.

He bursts into the presence of [[Julius Caesar]] (here Arthur's contemporary) and tells the emperor that only the wild man of the woods can interpret the dream that has been troubling him. Later, he returns in the form of a black, shaggy man, barefoot, with a torn coat. In another episode, he decides to do something that will be spoken of forever. Going into the forest of Brocéliande, he transforms himself into a herdsman carrying a club and wearing a wolf-skin and leggings. He is large, bent, black, lean, hairy and old, and his ears hang down to his waist. His head is as big as a buffalo's, his hair is down to his waist, he has a hump on his back, his feet and hands are backwards, he is hideous, and is over 18 feet tall. By his arts, he calls a herd of deer to come and graze around him.&lt;ref name="loomis" /&gt;|group="note"}} These works were adapted and translated into several other languages. Notably, the Post-Vulgate ''Suite'' was the source for the early parts of Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s influential English language ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.

Later medieval works also deal with the Merlin legend. One, ''Les Prophéties de Merlin'' (c. 1276) contains long prophecies of Merlin (mostly concerned with 11th to 13th-century Italian history and contemporary politics), some by his ghost after his death, interspersed with episodes relating Merlin's deeds and with various Arthurian adventures in which Merlin does not appear at all. The earliest English verse romance concerning Merlin is ''Of Arthour and of Merlin'', which drew from the chronicles and the French Lancelot-Grail. 

As the Arthurian myths were retold and embellished, Merlin's prophetic aspects were sometimes de-emphasised in favour of portraying him as a wizard and an elder advisor to Arthur. His role could be embellished and added to that of Aurelianus Ambrosius, or he could be made into just one of old Uther's favourite advisors.

Merlin's apprentice is often [[Morgan le Fay]] (in the ''Prophéties de Merlin'' along with [[Sebile]] and two other witch queens), Arthur's half-sister and sometimes Merlin's lover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/conlee-prose-merlin-arthur-and-gawain|title=Arthur and Gawain - Robbins Library Digital Projects|author=|date=|website=rochester.edu|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119190904/https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/conlee-prose-merlin-arthur-and-gawain|archivedate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the many modern works, Merlin and Morgan are never enemies in any medieval tradition. In fact, Merlin loves Morgan so much, that he even lies to Arthur (in the Huth ''Merlin'', which is the only instance of him ever doing such a thing) in order to save her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=pl&amp;id=CpWNAgAAQBAJ|title=Merlin: A Casebook|last=Goodrich|first=Peter H.|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781135583408|location=|pages=149-150|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Lancelot-Grail and later accounts, Merlin's eventual undoing came from his lusting after a woman often named [[Lady of the Lake|Nimue or Viviane]] (among various names and spellings), another female student of his and an [[unrequited love]] interest. Merlin's downfall and demise or eternal imprisonment is recounted differently in various versions of the narrative.{{#tag:ref|In the ''Suite du Merlin'', for example, Nimue is a 12 years old daughter of the king of Northumberland. She is about to depart from Arthur's court, but, with some encouragement from Merlin, Arthur asks her to stay in his castle with the queen. During her stay, Merlin falls in love with her and desires her. Nimue, frightened that Merlin might take advantage of her with his spells, swears that she will never love him unless he swears to teach her all of his magic. Merlin consents, unaware that throughout the course of her lessons, Nimue will use Merlin's own powers against him, forcing him to do her bidding. When Nimue finally goes back to her country, Merlin escorts her. However, along the way, Merlin receives a vision that Arthur is in need of assistance. Nimue and Merlin rush back to Arthur's castle, but have to stop for the night in a stone chamber, once inhabited by two lovers. Merlin relates that when the lovers died, they were placed in a magic tomb within a room in the chamber. That night, while Merlin is asleep, Nimue, still disgusted with Merlin's desire for her, as well as his demonic heritage, casts a spell over him and places him in the magic tomb so that he can never escape, thus causing his death.&lt;ref name="wilhelm"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert de Boron|editor=James J. Wilhelm|title =Suite du Merlin|publisher=Garland Reference Library|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} The enchanted prison can be a cave (as in the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a large rock (as in ''Le Morte d'Arthur''), an invisible tower, or a tree; in one version, Nimue confines him in the [[enchanted forest]] of [[Brocéliande]] with walls of air, visible as mist to others but as a beautiful tower to him.&lt;ref name="loomis"&gt;Loomis, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; In some texts, including in ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', Nimue then replaces Merlin in the role of Arthur's court mage and adviser as a [[Lady of the Lake]].

In the ''Prophéties de Merlin'', his tomb is unsuccessfully searched for by various parties, including by Morgan and her enchantresses, but cannot be accessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larrington|first=Carolyne|title=The Enchantress, the Knight and the Cleric: Authorial Surrogates in Arthurian Romance’|url=https://www.academia.edu/265037/The_Enchantress_the_Knight_and_the_Cleric_Authorial_Surrogates_in_Arthurian_Romance_|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legendary Brocéliande is often identified as the real-life [[Paimpont forest]] in Brittany.

'''Fővárosi Szabó Ervin Könyvtár''' (literally ''Metropolitan Ervin Szabó Library'') is the largest library network in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]].

The Metropolitan Ervin Szabó Library's main branch is housed in the 19th-century [[neo-baroque]] Wenckheim Palace.

The municipal library needed more space as its collection grew, so it expanded to a network of additional buildings while restoring the palace as a national monument. The library is now 13,000 m² and houses Budapest's largest public collection of books with a capacity for 1,100,000 volumes.

In 2003, the International Real Estate Federation awarded the [[Prix d’Excellence]] to its central building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiabci.org/awards-archieve.aspx Prix d' Excellence  Previous Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002003533/http://www.fiabci.org/awards-archieve.aspx |date=2015-10-02 }}, FIABCI&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Monsters vs. Aliens''''' is a [[media franchise]] created by [[DreamWorks Animation]]. The franchise began with the 2009 film ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'' and has since grown to include a short film, two television specials, a television series, and a video game.

The franchise involves a group of monsters who are assigned by the [[US Government]] to defend [[Earth]] from various [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] and [[supernatural]] threats.

==Feature film==
{{main|Monsters vs. Aliens}}
''Monsters vs. Aliens''  is a 2009 American [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] 3-D [[science fiction]] [[action comedy]] [[film]]. It was DreamWorks Animation's first feature film to be directly produced in a [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] 3-D format instead of being converted into 3-D after completion, which added $15 million to the film's budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Susan |last= Wloszczyna |title=First look: ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' is the ultimate; a 3-D 'first' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-03-10-monsters-aliens_N.htm |work=USA Today|date= March 11, 2008|accessdate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was scheduled for a May 2009 release, but the release date was moved to March 27, 2009. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray September 29, 2009, in North America and included the easter egg to the upcoming movies and previews. The film features the voices of [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Will Arnett]], [[Conrad Vernon]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Stephen Colbert]], and [[Paul Rudd]].

===Possible sequel===
In April 2011, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] commented that the studio did not have plans to produce future movie genre parodies, like ''[[Shark Tale]]'', ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'', and ''[[Megamind]]'', saying that these films "all shared an approach and tone and idea of parody, and did not travel well internationally. We don't have anything like that coming on our schedule now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/04/dreamworks-pins-hopes-on-kung-fu-panda-2-after-first-quarter-earnings-fall-short-125845/|title=DreamWorks Animation Pins Hopes On 'Kung Fu Panda 2' After 1Q Earnings Fall Short|last=Lieberman|first=David|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short films==

===''B.O.B.'s Big Break''===
''B.O.B.'s Big Break'' is a 3D animated short film. The short premiered on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] in 2D on September 26, 2009, and was released 3 days later in 2D and 3D on the ''Monsters vs Aliens'' [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and the double DVD pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Smash Hit Comedy, MONSTERS VS.

B.O.B., Dr. Cockroach, PhD, and The Missing Link are trying to outwit Captain W.R. Monger to escape from Area 52, the government's top-secret holding cell. Cockroach's escape attempt by feeding B.O.B. a chemical mixture to turn him into a bomb instead results in B.O.B. temporarily acquiring the ability to read minds, and allowing them to find out about a secret exit from Area 52. Unfortunately, the plan fails when B.O.B. smashes the jet they were using to escape believing it to be a [[piñata]], with the resulting explosion erasing B.O.B.'s new power.

Following the cliff hanger at the end of ''Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space'', the mutated carrot has spawned hundreds of zombie carrots which once they bite a victim they take control of the subject's mind. Dr. Cockroach determines that the only way to defeat the carrots and free their victims is for B.O.B. to eat all of the carrots (specifically because B.O.B. has no brain and thus is immune to the carrots' mind control powers), which B.O.B eventually, albeit reluctantly, does. At the end of the short, B.O.B. is turned into a giant zombie carrot.

Susan and the fellow monsters go back to Susan's home in Modesto, California; just in time for Halloween celebrations. Susan spends time with her parents, while the other monsters join in trick-or-treating and collect a large amount of candy. Later, it is revealed that the monsters came to destroy mutant pumpkins disguised as Jack-o-lanterns. When the pumpkins begin to eat children's candies to grow larger, the monsters and children defeat them by throwing excessive candy to bloat them up and explode them. But, in a [[twist ending]], some of the pumpkin "blood" (a green goo that mutated the ordinary pumpkins) falls into a planting of carrots, causing a mutant carrot to be formed.

'''Music [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]]''' is the copying and distributing of recordings of a piece of music for which the rights owners (composer, recording artist, or [[copyright]]-holding record company) did not give consent. In the contemporary legal environment, it is a form of [[copyright infringement]], which may be either a [[tort|civil wrong]] or a crime depending on jurisdiction. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw much controversy over the ethics of redistributing media content, how much production and distribution companies in the media were losing, and the very scope of what ought to be considered piracy — and cases involving the piracy of music were among the most frequently discussed in the debate.

==History==
The invention of the internet and digital media created music piracy in its modern form. With the invention of newer technology that allowed for the piracy process to become less complicated, it became much more common. Users of the web began adding media files to the internet, and prior potential risks and difficulties to pirating music, such as the physicality of the process, were eliminated. It was much easier for people with little to no knowledge of technology and old piracy methods to gather media files.&lt;ref name="Online Piracy-History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Piracy-History|url=http://piracy.web.unc.edu/brief-history-of-online-piracy/|website=Online Piracy|publisher=UNC Digital Commons|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first application that demonstrated the implications of music piracy was [[Napster]]. Napster enabled users to exchange music files over a common free server without any regard for copyright laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Piracy|url=http://www.csun.edu/~ch1842/piracy/index.html|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napster was quickly shut down after lawsuits filed by [[Metallica]] and [[Dr. Dre]] and a separate lawsuit in regards to the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].&lt;ref name="Online Piracy-History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Napster settles suits|url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/07/12/news/napster/|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other music sharing services such as [[Limewire]] continued to be a resource to those searching for free music files. These platforms were also removed after a few years of service due to copyright laws and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. After finding some loopholes, piracy began to exist in more legal forms, an example being [[Pirate Bay]]. This technical legality was due to the format of the websites and their country of origin and administration. The websites were set up so that the site itself did not host any of the illegal files, but gave the user a map as to where they could access the files. Additionally, in Pirate Bay's case, the website was hosted under Swedish law, where this “map” was not illegal.&lt;ref name="Online Piracy-History"/&gt;

===Arguments over legality===
In face of the growing encroachment on potential sales from internet piracy, industry associations like the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) have lobbied for stricter laws and stricter punishment of those breaking copyright law. Record companies have also turned to technological barriers to copying, such as [[Digital rights management|DRM]], to some [[Digital right management#Controversy|controversy]]. These organizations have tried to add more controls to the digital copy of the music to prevent consumers from copying the music. For the most part, the industry has come to a consensus that, if not DRM, then some similar measures are necessary for them to continue to make a profit.

Critics of the record companies' strategy have proposed that the attempts to maintain sales rates are impeding the rights of legitimate listeners to use and listen to the music as they wish. When the US Congress passed the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], it deliberately gave less copyright control to music composers than that of novelists: "Its fear was the monopoly power of rights holders, and that that power would stifle follow-on creativity".&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt; According to the internationally established [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]],&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; "Existing laws and regulations may be too broad and general to deal adequately with the rapid technological developments that facilitate digital piracy, and policy makers may need to consider enacting some specific provisions to deal with these infringements. Such provisions should not unduly impede legitimate digital communications, nor unreasonably impact on the Internet as an effective communications platform, commercial channel and educational tool..."&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt;

There have been several means of free access to copyrighted music for the general public including Napster, Limewire, and Spotify. Napster was a free file sharing software created by college student Shawn Fanning to enable people to share and trade music files in mp3 format. Napster became hugely popular because it made it so easy to share and download music files. However, the heavy metal band Metallica sued the company for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/04/14/mu4.html | work=Forbes | first=Amy | last=Doan | title=Metallica Sues Napster}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to other artists following suit and shutting down Napster’s service. Likewise, Limewire was a free peer-to-peer file sharing software similar to that of Napster. The software enabled unlimited file sharing between computers and ended being one of the most popular sharing networks around. Like Napster, Limewire struggled through multiple legal battles and inevitably wound up being shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/oct/27/limewire-shut-down|title=LimeWire shut down by federal court|author=Josh Halliday|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spotify and other on-demand streaming services are offering a way for consumers to still get their music for free while also contributing to the musician in a small way instead of simply illegally downloading the music, but it also moves customers away from buying hard copies of music or even legally downloading songs which is severely reducing artists' income. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wlömert|first=Nils|last2=Papies|first2=Dominik|date=2016-06-01|title=On-demand streaming services and music industry revenues — Insights from Spotify's market entry|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167811615001226|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|series=The Entertainment Industry|volume=33|issue=2|pages=314–327|doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2015.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) since Shawn Fanning started the program file sharing program Napster in 1999 music revenue has gone down 53% from $14.6 billion to $7.0 billion in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RIAA - Scope Of The Problem - June 14, 2015|url = https://www.riaa.com/physicalpiracy.php?content_selector=piracy-online-scope-of-the-problem|website = riaa.com|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study done in 2007 by the Institute of Policy Innovation states that music piracy resulted in a loss of 71,060 U.S. jobs, out of which 23,860 would have been in the recording industry and 44,200 jobs in other unrelated industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipi.org/ipi_issues/detail/the-true-cost-of-sound-recording-piracy-to-the-us-economy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law enforcement===
The RIAA, a powerful lobby for the recording industry, is responsible for carrying out most of the lawsuits against music piracy in the United States. Some claim that the enforcement against music piracy, which may cost copyright violators up to $150,000 per infringement,&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt; is unreasonable, and that it may even violate United States constitutional protections against [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. Some have accused the RIAA of outright bullying, as when one of their lawyers, Matt Oppenheimer, told the defendant in one lawsuit, “You don’t want to pay another visit to a dentist like me".&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt; In that same case, according to Lawrence Lessig, "the RIAA insisted it would not settle the case until it took every penny [the defendant] had saved".&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt;

Further attempts at progress towards controlling the privacy of public media content by targeting the elimination of piracy were made when the highly anticipated yet often debated bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) was passed in recent years. The bill was first introduced in October 2011 by the United States House representative Lamar S. Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/house-introduces-internet-piracy-bill/2011/10/26/gIQA0f5xJM_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Cecilia | last=Kang | title=House introduces Internet piracy bill | date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general scope of the law was to fulfill the goal of putting a stop to online piracy by expanding upon existing criminal laws regarding copyright violations. The essential goal of the bill was to protect intellectual property of content creators by raising awareness of the severity of punishments for copyright infringement. Naturally, the bill was met with considerable opposition from various parties. One instance of this was an article comment by Edward J. Black, president and CEO of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, who questioned the potential effectiveness of the bill by reasoning that the major pirate websites that SOPA attempts to eliminate could just as easily respawn under a different name if taken down as early as a few hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/edward-j-black/stop-online-piracy-act-vote_b_1145949.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Internet Users, Free Speech Experts, Petition Against SOPA | date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, strong protest attempts were made across the internet when numerous high-profile online organizations including Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, and participating in American Censorship Day on January 18, with some sites including Reddit and Wikipedia going as far as completely blacking out all of their pages, redirecting the user to SOPA protest messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2011-11-16/-american-censorship-day-makes-an-online-statement-the-ticker|title='American Censorship Day' Makes an Online Statement: The Ticker|date=16 November 2011|work=BloombergView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, as a result of aggressive protests and lack of consenting opinions within the congress, SOPA was tabled on January 20 by its creator, House representative Lamar Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/01/20/sopa-is-dead-timeline-january-blackout/|title=The Week That Killed SOPA: A Timeline|author=Alex Fitzpatrick|date=20 January 2012|work=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic ramifications==
Piracy's real effect on music sales is difficult to accurately assess. In [[neoclassical economics]] prices are determined by the combination of the forces of [[supply and demand]], but the participators in the digital market do not always follow the usual motives and behaviors of the supply and demand system. First, the cost of digital distribution has decreased significantly from the costs of distribution by former methods. Furthermore, the majority of the filesharing community will distribute copies of music for a zero price in monetary terms, and there are some consumers who are willing to pay a certain price for legitimate copies even when they could just as easily obtain pirated copies,&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; such as with [[pay what you want]] vendors.

Another issue is that because many people in the world illegally download music because they cannot afford to purchase legitimate copies, not every illegal download necessarily equates to a lost sale. This has some effect on music sales, but as [[Lawrence Lessig]] points out, there is wide asymmetry between the estimated volume of illegal downloading and the projected loss of sales:

{{cquote|In 2002, the RIAA reported that CD sales had fallen by 8.9 percent, from 882 million to 803 million units; revenues fell 6.7 percent. This confirms a trend over the past few years. The RIAA blames Internet piracy for the trend, though there are many other causes that could account for this drop. SoundScan, for example, reports a more than 20 percent drop in the number of CDs released since 1999. That no doubt accounts for some of the decrease in sales... But let’s assume the RIAA is right, and all of the decline in CD sales is because of Internet sharing. Here’s the rub: In the same period that the RIAA estimates that 803 million CDs were sold, the RIAA estimates that 2.1 billion CDs were downloaded for free. Thus, although 2.6 times the total number of CDs sold were downloaded for free, sales revenue fell by just 6.7 percent... [So] there is a huge difference between downloading a song and stealing a CD.&lt;ref name=lessig&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Lawrence Lessig]]|year=2004 |title=Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity |location=New York |publisher=The Penguin Press |isbn=1-59420-006-8 |oclc=53324884 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Woolley's introduction each year It is estimated that 12.5 billion dollars are lost due to file sharing and music piracy, and 5 billion of that is profits lost from the music industry directly. Due to this dramatic loss in profits the music industry has been forced to cut down their staffing. Music piracy has become such an issue that the industry is encouraged to adapt to this new era and change.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, D. J. (2010). The cynical pirate: how cynicism effects music piracy. Academy of Information and Management Sciences Journal, 13(1), 31+. Retrieved from http://bi.galegroup.com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/essentials/article/GALE|A241861851/b8772514a705be025bdcd7edee6d5cdc?u=maine_orono&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital copies==
The article, "The Music Industry On (The) Line? Surviving Music Piracy In A Digital Era" By Jelle Janssens, Stijn Vandaele, and Tom Vander Beken presents an analysis of the prevalence of piracy in music trade, which has affected the global sales of CDs. This article points out that technological development such as file sharing, MP3 players, and CDRs have increased music piracy. The most common forms of music piracy are Internet Piracy and compact disc piracy. It also discusses the association between music piracy and organized crime, which is defined as profit-driven illegal activities. The fact that digital products are virtual instead of physical affects the economic mechanisms behind the production and distribution of content, and how piracy works for digital as opposed to physical products: "the main consequence of the non-physical form of digital products is their virtually negligible marginal cost of reproduction and their ability to be digitally delivered."&lt;ref name=oecd&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Stryszowski |editor1-first=Piotr |editor2-last=Scorpecci |editor2-first=Danny |year=2009 |title=Piracy of Digital Content |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Publishing |isbn=978-92-64-06543-7 |oclc=663833839 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of burning a CD drastically lowered the [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] for record companies, as well as for music pirates, and with the growing tendency toward [[online distribution]] among legitimate and illicit distributors alike, the expense of distributing shrunk further from the costs of printing and transporting CDs to merely the costs of maintaining a [[website]].&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; By sheer volume of file transfers, though, distributing music through traditional web servers and [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers were not as popular as [[peer to peer]] (P2P) now, because the traditional [[Direct download link|direct download]] method is slower.

The 2008 British Music Rights survey&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Orlowski]]. ''[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/16/bmr_music_survey/ 80% want legal P2P - survey]''. [[The Register]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 80% of people in Britain wanted a legal P2P service. This was consistent with the results of earlier research conducted in the United States, upon which the [[Open Music Model]] was based.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]]. ''[http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8438 Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models]''. [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the majority of filesharers in the survey preferred to get their music from "local sources" such as [[Local area network|LAN]] connections, [[email]], [[USB flash drive|flash drives]], sharing with other people they know personally.&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; The other most common method of filesharing was with P2P technologies. By 2007, P2P networks' popularity had grown so much that they used as much as 39% of the total volume of information exchanged over the internet.&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt;

==Rights Holders Solution==
Alongside the RIAA and BPI's industry anti-piracy service sit a number of other independent companies offering anti-piracy solutions. 
These companies tend to have a better reach and success rate than the slower industry bodies and provide an alternative solution. Notable market leaders include [[Audiolock|AudioLock]], Web Sheriff, Topple Track, Detecnet, Muso and Attributor.

==Minimising Online Music Piracy==
There are ways to minimise music piracy on using the latest Google court decisions on the [[right to be forgotten]] as well as using some proven techniques relating to adding a watermark to the tracks and uploading the files yourself with promotional intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mixingmastering.co.uk/music-piracy-how-to-avoid/|title=Music Piracy And How To Avoid It|work=Mixing Mastering Resources for Music, Media and Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper called the '''Music Anti-Piracy Best Practise Guidelines''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicindie.com/resources/document-library|title=Document library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been published by music anti-piracy specialists [http://www.audiolock.net AudioLock] and endorsed by the [[Association of Independent Music]], the Association For Electronic Music (AFEM), [[Digital distribution|music distributors]] Believe Digital and [[Judge Jules]] (DJ and Lawyer). These guidelines give advice on how to minimise exposure to music-piracy and how best to utilise the solutions that are available.

Statistics have shown that since the latter half the 2000s, there has been a decline in music piracy. According to a NPD survey, in 2012, approximately one in ten Internet users in the United States downloaded music through a file sharing service similar to BitTorrent or LimeWire. This number is significantly less than 2005, the peak of the piracy phenomenon, when one in five users used peer-to-peer networks to gather music files. The emergence of free streaming services has decreased the number of users who pirate music on the internet. Services such as [[Spotify]] and [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]] have easy-to-use interfaces and decrease the risk for computer viruses and spyware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luckerson|first1=Victor|title=Revenue Up, Piracy Down: Has the Music Industry Finally Turned a Corner?|url=http://business.time.com/2013/02/28/revenue-up-piracy-down-has-the-music-industry-finally-turned-a-corner/|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=Time Magazine|date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to the illegal software used by older music piracy networks such as Napster or Limewire, current music streaming services such as Spotify and Rdio offer cheap yet legal access to copyrighted music by paying the rights holders through money made off of payments made by premium users and through advertisements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/30081/13-streaming-music-services-compared-by-price-quality-catalog-size-and-more/ | work=Time | title=13 Streaming Music Services Compared by Price, Quality, Catalog Size and More | first=Matt | last=Peckham | date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''National Anthem of the Republic of Colombia'''" ({{lang-es|Himno Nacional de la República de Colombia}}) is the official name of the [[national anthem]] of [[Colombia]]. It is commonly known by its [[incipit]] "'''¡Oh gloria inmarcesible!'''" ({{Lang-en|"O Unfading Glory"}}), although this is not its official title. It is largely the creation of José Domingo Torres, an actor from Bogotá, who took a poem written by former Colombian president Rafael Núñez and asked a friend, opera singer Oreste Sindici, to set it to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/colombia-himno-nacional-de-la-republica-de-colombia-oh-gloria-inmarcesible | title=Colombia: Himno Nacional de la República de Colombia (¡Oh gloria inmarcesible!) | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2011-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official announcement of the song came in the form of Act 33 of October 28, 1920. The law 198 of 1995, which legislates national symbols, its broadcast became mandatory for all radio and [[Television in Colombia|television]] in the country both at 6:00 am and at 6:00 pm (the latter half, at various times for private open signal and not applicable to national TV channels by cable), and public addresses of the [[President of Colombia|President of the Republic]] and other official events.

== Instrumental introduction lyrics ==
During the [[Colombia–Peru War|border conflict with Peru (1932–1934)]], the soldiers who defended Colombia's national sovereignty added a new verse after the trumpet fanfare. Written specifically for that time of war, it soon fell into disuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivosonoro.org/?id=75 Eduardo Galeano y Don Quijote de la Mancha]&lt;/ref&gt; The words are:

:Hoy que la madre patria se halla herida,
:Hoy que debemos todos combatir, combatir,
:Demos por ella nuestra vida
:Que morir por la patria no es morir, es vivir

: Now when the motherland is wounded,
: Now when we must all fight, fight,
: Let us give our life for her,
: Because to die for one's country is not to die but live.

According to José Antonio Amaya,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-3340627|title=UNA INICIATIVA NORTESANTANDEREANA  Buscan meter al general Santander en el Himno|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|website=El Tiempo|language=es-CO|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; elementary school students in the 1930s were taught this stanza.

The final line is very similar to a line in the [[national anthem of Cuba]] that goes, "¡Que morir por la patria es vivir!"

== Usage ==
The anthem should be played chorus-verse-chorus. Although the first verse is usually sung between choruses, any of the eleven verses may be used. The anthem should be played chorus-verse-chorus regardless of which verse is selected. This is how it is customarily performed in all public, political, and other important events both public and private.

However, it is not uncommon for only the chorus and verse to be played without repeating the chorus. This is usually the case when brevity is sought. By law, radio and television broadcasts must play the national anthem at 6:00 am and 6:00 pm, and the radio invariably uses the shorter format. The shorter anthem is also used at international events such as the Olympic Games or World Cup.

In ceremonies of the Colombian Artillery, the last verse is used instead of the first verse.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The Colombian Cavalry traditionally uses the sixth verse, while the 4th verse is used by the [[Colombian Navy]].

The '''need for cognition''' ('''NFC'''), in [[psychology]], is a [[personality trait|personality variable]] reflecting the extent to which individuals are inclined towards [[Effortfulness|effortful]] cognitive activities.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = John T. | last2 = Petty | first2 = Richard E. | year = 1982 | title = The need for cognition | url = http://psycinfo.apa.org/doi/index.cfm?fuseaction=showUIDAbstract&amp;uid=1982-22487-001 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 1| pages = 116–131 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.42.1.116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cacioppo1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = Rodriguez | last2 = Petty | first2 = John T. | last3 = Kao | first3 = Richard E. | last4 = Feng | first4 = Chuan | last5 = Regina | first5 =  | year = 1986 | title = Central and peripheral routes to persuasion: An individual difference perspective | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/51/5/1032.html | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 5| pages = 1032–1043 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.51.5.1032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Need for cognition has been variously defined as "a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways" and "a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world".&lt;ref name="Cohen1955"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = A.R. | last2 = Stotland | first2 = E. | last3 = Wolfe | first3 = D.M. | year = 1955 | title = An Experimental Investigation of Need for Cognition | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 291–294 | doi=10.1037/h0042761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher NFC is associated with increased appreciation of debate, idea evaluation, and problem solving. Those with a high need for cognition may be inclined towards  [[Elaboration likelihood model#Central route|high elaboration]]. Those with a lower need for cognition may display opposite tendencies, and may process information more [[Heuristic|heuristically]], often through [[Elaboration likelihood model#Peripheral route|low elaboration]].&lt;ref name="Dole1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dole | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Sinatra | first2 = G.M. | year = 1998 | title = Reconceptualizing Change in the Cognitive Construction of Knowledge | url = | journal = Educational Psychologist | volume = 33 | issue = 2–3| pages = 109–128 | doi=10.1080/00461520.1998.9653294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Need for cognition is closely related to the [[five factor model]] domain [[openness to experience#Measurement|openness to experience]], [[typical intellectual engagement]], and epistemic curiosity (see below).

==History==
Cohen, Stotland and Wolfe (1955),&lt;ref name="Cohen1955"/&gt; in their work on individual differences in cognitive motivation, identified a "''need for cognition''" which they defined as "the individual's need to organize his experience meaningfully", the "need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways", and "need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world" (p.&amp;nbsp;291). They argued that, if this "need" were frustrated, it would generate "feelings of tension and deprivation" that would instigate "active efforts to structure the situation and increase understanding" (p.&amp;nbsp;291), though the particular situations arousing and satisfying the need may vary (p.&amp;nbsp;291). Cohen argued that even in structured situations, people high in NFC see ambiguity and strive for higher standards of cognitive clarity.

Cohen and colleagues&lt;ref name="Cohen1955"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen1957"&gt;Cohen, A.R. (1957). "Need for Cognition and Order of Communication as Determinants of Opinion Change," 79–97. In Hovland, C.I. (ed.), ''The Order of Presentation in Persuasion'', Yale University Press, (New Haven).&lt;/ref&gt; themselves identified multiple prior identifications of need for cognition, citing works by [[Gardner Murphy|Murphy]], [[Abraham Maslow|Maslow]], Katz, [[Harry Harlow|Harlow]] and [[Solomon Asch|Asch]]&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, G. ''Personality''. New York: Harper, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maslow | first1 = A.H. | year = | title = A theory of human motivation | url = | journal = Psychol. Rev. | volume = 1943 | issue = 50| pages = 370–396 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Katz | first1 = D. | last2 = Sarnoff | first2 = I. | year = | title = Motivational bases of attitude change | url = | journal = J. Abnorm. Soc. Psychol. | volume = 1954 | issue = 49| pages = 115–124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harlow | first1 = H.F. | last2 = Harlow | first2 = M.K. | last3 = Meyer | first3 = D. | year = | title = Learning motivated by a manipulation drive | url = | journal = J.

New York, Prentice-Hall, 1952".&lt;/ref&gt; They&lt;ref name="Cohen1955" /&gt;  distinguished their concept from the apparently similar "intolerance of ambiguity" proposed by [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik|Frenkel-Brunswik]],&lt;ref name="Brunswik1949"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frenkel-Brunswik | first1 = E | year = 1949 | title = Intolerance of ambiguity as an emotional and perceptual personality variable | url = | journal = J. Pers. | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 108–143 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1949.tb01236.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that NFC does not reflect the need to experience an integrated and meaningful world. Contemporary research suggests that Cohen's conception of need is, however, closer to tolerance of ambiguity, need for structure, or need for cognitive closure than to current ideas of need for cognition. For instance, studies using Cohen's measures indicated avoidance of ambiguity and a need to get "meaning" even if this meant relying on heuristics or expert advice rather than careful scrutiny of incoming information.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cacioppo|first=John T.|author2=Petty, Richard E. |author3=Feinstein, Jeffrey A. |author4= Jarvis, W. Blair G. |title=Dispositional Differences in Cognitive Motivation: The Life and Times of Individuals Varying in Need for Cognition|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=March 1996|volume=119|issue=2|pages=197–253|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.2.197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on this work, [[John T. Cacioppo|Cacioppo]] therefore moved away from drive-reduction toward measuring [[Differential psychology|individual differences]] in the self-reward potential of cognitive activity,&lt;ref name="Thompson1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = E.P. | last2 = Chaiken | first2 = S. | last3 = Hazlewood | first3 = J.D. | year = 1993 | title = Need for Cognition and Desire for Control as Moderators of Extrinsic Reward Effects: A Person × Situation Approach to the Study of Intrinsic Motivation | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 6| pages = 987–999 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.6.987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|988}} stressing (p.&amp;nbsp;118) that they were using the word need in the statistical sense of a "likelihood or tendency", rather than in the rudimentary biological sense of "tissue deprivation", they defined the need for cognition as an individual's tendency to "engage in and enjoy thinking" (p.&amp;nbsp;116) and the tendency to "organize, abstract, and evaluate information" (p.&amp;nbsp;124)—or, variously, as a stable, but individually different "tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors", or an "intrinsic motivation to engage in effortful cognitive endeavors... and exercise their mental faculties",&lt;ref name="Cacioppo1996" /&gt;{{rp|197}} or an "intrinsic motivation for effortful thought".&lt;ref name="Thompson1993" /&gt;{{rp|997}}

Cacioppo and Petty (1982) created their own 34-item scale to measure the need for cognition. Two years later, an 18-item version was published&lt;ref name="Cacioppo1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = J.T. | last2 = Petty | first2 = R.E. | last3 = Kao | first3 = C.F. | year = 1984 | title = The Efficient Assessment of Need for Cognition | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 48 | issue = 3| pages = 306–307 | doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa4803_13| pmid = 16367530 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in most of the cases reported in the subsequent literature it is this amended scale that is administered. Recently, a 6-item version of the need for cognition scale was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lins de Holanda Coelho|first=Gabriel|last2=H. P. Hanel|first2=Paul|last3=J.

People high in the need for cognition are more likely to form their attitudes by paying close attention to relevant arguments (i.e., via the [[Elaboration likelihood model#Central route|central route to persuasion]]), whereas people low in the need for cognition are more likely to rely on [[Elaboration likelihood model#Peripheral route|peripheral cues]], such as how attractive or credible a speaker is.  People low in need for cognition are also more likely to rely on stereotypes alone in judging other people than those high in  need for cognition.&lt;ref name=Cacioppo2000&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Individual Differences in Social behavior|year=2009|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York/London|isbn=978-1-59385-647-2|pages=318–329|author=Petty, Richard E.|author2=Briñol, P |author3=Loersch, C. |author4=McCaslin, M.J. |editor=Leary, Mark R. |editor2=Hoyle, Rick H.|chapter=Chapter 21. The Need for Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological research on the need for cognition has been conducted using self-report tests, where research participants answered a series of statements such as "I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that I must solve" and were scored on how much they felt the statements represented them. The results have suggested that people who are high in the need for cognition scale score slightly higher in verbal intelligence tests but no higher in abstract reasoning tests.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo1996"/&gt;

Research has concluded that individuals high in NFC are less likely to attribute higher social desirability to more attractive individuals or to mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perlini|first=Arthur H.|author2=Hansen, Samantha|title=Moderating effects of need for cognition on attractiveness stereotyping|journal=Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal|year=2001|volume=29|issue=4|pages=313–321|doi=10.2224/sbp.2001.29.4.313}}&lt;/ref&gt; College students high in NFC report higher [[life satisfaction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCR/is_2_38/ai_n6130140/print The need for cognition and life satisfaction among college students]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on [[lucid dreaming]] found that frequent and occasional lucid dreamers scored higher on NFC than non-lucid dreamers.&lt;ref name=Cacioppo2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blagrove|first=M|author2=Hartnell, S.J.|title=Lucid dreaming: associations with internal locus of control, need for cognition and creativity|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2000|volume=28|pages=41–47|url=http://files.meetup.com/1675783/Lucid%20dreaming_cognition_creativity_locus%20of%20control.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(99)00078-1|access-date=2011-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426045505/http://files.meetup.com/1675783/Lucid%20dreaming_cognition_creativity_locus%20of%20control.pdf|archive-date=2012-04-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests there is continuity between waking and dreaming cognitive styles. Researchers have argued that this is because self-reflectiveness or self-focused attention is heightened in lucid dreams and also is associated with greater need for cognition.

===Relationship to intelligence===
A number of studies have found moderate correlations between NFC and measures of verbal intelligence. One study found that need for cognition had a moderate positive correlation with [[fluid intelligence]] (reasoning ability, particularly verbal, and to a lesser extent numeric and figural reasoning), and a weaker correlation with [[crystallised intelligence]] (knowledge), which had much smaller positive correlations.&lt;ref name=Monika/&gt;

===Dual-system theory===
NFC has been incorporated into Epstein's dual-system theory of personality called [[cognitive-experiential self-theory]].&lt;ref name=Cacioppo2000/&gt; The theory proposes that people have two information processing systems, a rational system and an experiential system. The rational system is thought to be logical, verbal and relatively unemotional. The experiential system is thought to be intuitive, based on images and highly reliant on emotion. A modified version of the Need for Cognition scale has been used to assess individual differences in the rational system, whereas the experiential system has been assessed using a scale called Faith in Intuition.

Research shows that the two system are uncorrelated and hence independent of each other. That is individuals either high or low in need for cognition may also make use of their intuitions in forming judgments. In fact, individuals high and low in need for cognition respectively may make use of their intuitions in differing ways. When individuals give little thought to their judgments these judgments may be influenced directly by emotions, intuitions, and images in an automatic way. On the other hand, those who are high in need for cognition tend to give more thought to their judgments, and the thoughts generated may be indirectly biased by their emotions, intuitions, and images. Hence individuals high in need for cognition are not necessarily more "rational" than those low in this trait, if their faith in intuition is also high. Rather, their "irrational" intuitions tend to be given more thoughtful elaboration than those who are low in need for cognition and yet also high in faith in intuition.&lt;ref name=Cacioppo2000/&gt;

===Biases and decision making===
NFC is associated with the amount of thought that goes into making a decision. Both high and low levels of the trait may be associated with particular biases in judgment. People low in need for cognition tend to show more bias when this bias is due to relying on mental shortcuts, that is, heuristic biases. People high in this trait tend to be more affected by biases that are generated by effortful thought.&lt;ref name=Cacioppo2000/&gt;

====False memories====
High need for cognition is associated with a greater susceptibility to the creation of false memories associated with certain learning tasks. In a commonly used research paradigm, participants are asked to memorise a list of related words. Recognition is tested by having them pick out learned words from a set of studied and non-studied items. Certain non-studied items are conceptually related to studied items (e.g., ''chair'' if the original list contained ''table'' and ''legs''). People high in NFC are more likely to show [[false memory]] for these lures, due to their greater elaboration of learned items in memory as they are more likely to think of semantically related (but non-studied) items.&lt;ref name=Cacioppo2000/&gt;

====Halo effects====
A bias associated with low need for cognition is the [[halo effect]], a phenomenon in which attractive or likeable people tend to be rated as superior on a variety of other characteristics (e.g., intelligence). People low on NFC are more likely to rely on stereotypes rather than individual features of a person when rating a novel target. People high in NFC still show a halo effect however, albeit a smaller one, perhaps because their thoughts about the target are still biased by the target's attractiveness.&lt;ref name=Cacioppo2000/&gt;

==Relationship with personality traits==

===Related constructs===
NFC has been found to be strongly associated with a number of independently developed constructs, specifically epistemic curiosity, [[typical intellectual engagement]], and [[openness to experience#Measurement|openness to ideas]].&lt;ref name=Mussell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mussell|first=Patrick|title=Epistemic curiosity and related constructs: Lacking evidence of discriminant validity|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2010|volume=49|pages=506–510|url=http://www.citeulike.org/article/7387092|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.014|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Epistemic [[curiosity]] can be defined as “desire for knowledge that motivates individuals to learn new ideas, eliminate information-gaps, and solve intellectual problems”.&lt;ref name=Mussell /&gt;
* Typical intellectual engagement was proposed by Goff and Ackerman (1992) and was defined as a "personality construct that represents an individual’s aversion or attraction to tasks that are intellectually taxing".&lt;ref name=Mussell /&gt;
* Openness to ideas is a facet of [[openness to experience]] associated with "aspects of being open minded, engaging in unconventional thoughts, and solving problems and thinking as an end in itself".&lt;ref name=Mussell /&gt;
::Based on the very large positive correlation between NFC and  typical intellectual engagement (''r'' = .78) it has been argued that they may be essentially the same construct.&lt;ref name=Woo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woo|first=S.E. |author2=Harms, P.D. |author3=Kuncel, N.R|title=Integrating personality and intelligence: Typical intellectual engagement and need for cognition|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2007|volume=43|pages=1635–1639|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/integrating-personality-and-intelligence-typical-intellectual-engagement-and-need-for-cognition/|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.04.022|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Further studies have found that NFC,  typical intellectual engagement, epistemic curiosity, and openness to ideas were all strongly intercorrelated. [[Factor analysis]] showed that measures of all four constructs loaded strongly onto a single factor suggesting they all share a common conceptual basis.&lt;ref name=Mussell /&gt;
::The author of this study argued that although the four constructs lack [[discriminant validity]] they are not necessarily all conceptually equivalent as each one may emphasise particular aspects of functioning more than others.
* A study comparing need for cognition and openness to ideas using confirmatory factor analysis found that although the two constructs were very strongly related they were not redundant. NFC and openness to ideas had somewhat contrasting correlation patterns with other personality traits.
::For example, NFC was more strongly correlated with emotional stability and activity than openness to ideas, whereas openness to ideas was more strongly correlated with [[novelty seeking|novelty]] and [[sensation seeking|experience seeking]] than NFC.&lt;ref name=Monika/&gt;

===Other personality characteristics===
* Within the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, NFC has been found to relate positively to [[openness to experience]] most strongly and to a more moderate extent to [[conscientiousness]], particularly the competence and achievement striving facets, and to relate inversely to an extent to [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name=Monika&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0146167209351886|title=Same or Different?

* Regarding [[Cloninger]]'s temperament traits, NFC has been related negatively to [[harm avoidance]] and positively to [[persistence (psychology)|persistence]] and was unrelated to [[reward dependence]] or [[novelty seeking]].&lt;ref name=Monika/&gt;
* NFC has only a weak positive relationship with [[sensation seeking]], specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales.&lt;ref name=Monika/&gt;
* NFC has a modest inverse correlation with [[negative affect]]. NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect, although it was positively correlated with feelings of activity, interest, and alertness.&lt;ref name=Monika/&gt;
* NFC has been positively related to other, theoretically unrelated, personality characteristics such as [[self-esteem]], masculine sex-role attitudes, and [[absorption (psychology)|absorption]].
* NFC is negatively related to [[social anxiety]] (more strongly in females than males).&lt;ref name=osberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osberg|first=Timothy M.|title=The Convergent and Discriminant Validity of the Need for Cognition Scale|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|year=1987|volume=3|pages=441–450|doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa5103_11|pmid=16372844|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phares&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to personality|year=1997|publisher=Longman|location=New York|isbn=978-0-673-99456-1|author=Phares, E.J.|edition=Fourth|author2=Chaplin, W.F.|page=521|chapter=Chapter 15. Personality and Intellect}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery, and hence greater self-esteem, although it is also possible that higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking.
* NFC may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality.
* Regarding absorption, people high in NFC may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks.
* Regarding social anxiety, it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation.&lt;ref name=osberg/&gt;
*NFC is positively related to stimulation, self-direction, and universalism values, and negatively to security and conformity values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lins de Holanda Coelho|first=Gabriel|last2=H.

==Consumers==
Research has shown that high-need for cognition consumers prefer advertising that features open-ended comparative advertising which allows consumers to decide which brand is best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Brett A. S. | last2 = Lang | first2 = Bodo | last3 = Wong | first3 = Stephanie | year = 2004 | title = Conclusion Explicitness in Advertising: The Moderating Role of Need for Cognition and Argument Quality | url = http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-Lang-Wong-2004.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 32 | issue = 4| pages = 57–65 | doi=10.1080/00913367.2003.10639148| citeseerx = 10.1.1.506.5890 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFC has also offered insights into how people respond to alternative web site designs. Martin, Sherrard and Wentzel (2005) demonstrate that high-need for cognition people prefer web sites with high verbal complexity (more in-depth information) and low visual complexity (static images rather than animations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Brett A. S. |author2=Sherrard, Michael J. |author3=Wentzel, Daniel|title=The Role of Sensation Seeking and Need for Cognition on Web-Site Evaluations: A Resource-Matching Perspective|journal=Psychology and Marketing|year=2005|volume=22|issue=2|pages=109–126|doi=10.1002/mar.20050|url=http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-Sherarrd-Wentzel2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nigerian Academy of Letters''' is a [[national academy]] and apex body of arts and literature in Nigeria. It is an autonomous, [[scholarly]] and non-political state institution for advancing scholarship and public interest in the humanities at the highest level in Nigeria.  Established in 1974 after recommendation of ''"Udoji report of 1974"'' it is currently governed by executive committee of distinguished professors and promote limited number of four types of fellows; Foundation Fellows, Regular Fellows, Overseas Fellows and Honorary Fellows on a yearly basis.

There are currently 84 Fellows in the Academy; 7 foundation fellows, 51 regular fellows, 12 overseas fellows and 14 honorary fellows.&lt;ref name="Fellows"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nal.org.ng/fellows|title=Our Fellows|publisher=Nigerian Academy of Letters|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Academy was established in 1974 after a governmental report ''Udoji Report of 1974'' made a recommendation for the creation of national academies.&lt;ref name="NICI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nico.gov.ng/index.php/category-list/906-nigerian-academy-of-letters-holds-15th-annual-convocation|title=Nigerian Academy Of Letters Holds 15th Annual Convocation|publisher=National Institute for Cultural Orientation|date=12 August 2013|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fellowship ==
There are four types of fellows in the Nigerian Academy of Letters: Foundation Fellows, Regular Fellows (normally resident in Nigeria), Overseas Fellows (resident abroad) and Honorary Fellows.&lt;ref name="UI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/index.php/en/communication-and-information-sciences/237-unilorinnews/4047-unilorin-staff-members-tasked-on-fitness-exercise|title=Guidelines for the Nomination of Fellows
|publisher=[[University of Ilorin]]|date=|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fellows are appointed for life and every prospective fellow must be nominated by a living Fellow. Self-nomination is forbidden.&lt;ref name="UI"/&gt;
The Fellowship is given rarely to distinguished professors after a rigorous election exercise. Not more than two candidates from any discipline and not more than four in any one year can be admitted into the Academy. Elected Fellows are inducted at an investiture ceremony, which formally confers on them the right to use the [[postnominal]] Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Letters (FNAL).&lt;ref name="Laurels"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/others/laurels-by-the-nigerian-academy-of-letters/14783.html|title=Laurels by the Nigerian Academy of Letters|work=[[Daily Trust]]|author=Olu Obafemi|date=14 September 2013|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Foundation Fellows ===
Foundation Fellowship is static, non elected body of Nigerian scholars who are the founding members of the Academy.

{{IPA notice}}

The [[Persian language]] has six [[vowel]] [[phoneme]]s and twenty-three [[consonant]] phonemes.  It features contrastive [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[syllable]]-final [[consonant cluster]]s.

==Vowels==
[[File:Farsi vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|The vowel phonemes of Tehrani Persian.]] The chart to the right reflects the vowels of many educated Persian speakers from Tehran.&lt;ref name="ipa_handbook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook of the International Phonetic Association: A guide to the use of the International Phonetic Alphabet | year=1999 | author=International Phonetic Association | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-0-521-63751-0 | pages=124–125 | chapter=Persian (Farsi) | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/rosettaproject_pes_phon-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=George L.|authorlink1=George Campbell (linguist)|title=Concise compendium of the world's languages|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415160499|page=385|edition=1st publ.|chapter=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three vowels {{IPAslink|æ}}, {{IPAslink|e}} and {{IPAslink|o}} are traditionally referred to as 'short' vowels and the other three ({{IPAslink|ɒ|ɒː}}, {{IPAslink|i|iː}} and {{IPAslink|u|uː}}) as 'long' vowels. In fact the three 'short' vowels are short only when in an open syllable (i.e. a syllable ending in a vowel) that is non-final (but can be unstressed or stressed), e.g. {{nastaliq|صدا|fa}} {{IPA|[seˈdɒː]}} 'sound', {{nastaliq|خدا|fa}} {{IPA|[xoˈdɒː]}} 'God'. In a closed syllable (i.e. a syllable ending in a consonant) that is unstressed, they are around sixty percent as long as a long vowel; this is true for the 'long' vowel {{IPA|/iː/}} as well. Otherwise the 'short' and 'long' vowels are all pronounced long. Example: {{nastaliq|سفتر|fa}} {{IPA|[seˑfˈtʰæːɾ]}} 'firmer'.&lt;ref name=Toos&gt;Toosarvandani, Maziar D. 2004 [http://people.ucsc.edu/~mtoosarv/papers/toosarvandani_2004_JRAS.pdf "Vowel Length in Modern Farsi"], JRAS, Series 3, 14, 3, pp. 241–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the short vowels are in open syllables, they are also unstable and tend in informal styles to assimilate in quality to the following long vowel. Thus {{nastaliq|دویست|fa}} {{IPA|[deˈviːst]}} 'two hundred' becomes {{IPA|[diˈviːst]}}, {{nastaliq|شلوغ|fa}} {{IPA|[ʃoˈluːɢ]}} 'crowded' becomes {{IPA|[ʃuˈluːɢ]}}, {{nastaliq|رسیدن|fa}} {{IPA|[ræsiːˈdæːn]}} 'to arrive' becomes {{IPA|[resiːˈdæːn]}} and so on.&lt;ref name=Toos /&gt;

Word-final {{IPA|/o/}} is rare except for {{nastaliq|تو|fa}} {{IPA|/to/}} ('you' [singular]), loanwords (mostly of Arabic origin), and proper and common nouns of foreign origin, and word-final {{IPA|/æ/}} is very rare in Iranian Persian, an exception being {{nastaliq|نه|fa}} {{IPA|/næ/}} ('no').  The word-final {{IPA|/æ/}} in Early New Persian mostly shifted to {{IPA|/e/}} in contemporary Iranian Persian (often romanized as {{angbr|eh}}, meaning {{IPA|[e]}} is also an allophone of {{IPA|/æ/}} in word-final position in contemporary Iranian Persian), but is preserved in the Eastern dialects.

===Diphthongs===
The status of [[diphthongs]] in Persian is disputed.&lt;ref name=Windfuhr1979&gt;{{cite book|last1=Windfuhr|first1=Gernot L.|title=Persian grammar: History and State of its Study|date=1979|publisher=Mouton|isbn=9027977747|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0g8n9mmnjKgC&amp;pg=PA137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alamolhoda&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alamolhoda|first1=Seyyed Morleza|title=Phonostatistics and Phonotactics of the Syllable in Modern Persian|journal=Studia Orientalia|date=2000|volume=89|pages=14–15|url=http://ojs.tsv.fi/index.php/StOrE/issue/view/3422|issn=0039-3282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors list {{IPA|/ei̯, ou̯, ɒi̯, oi̯, ui̯/}},&lt;ref name=Windfuhr1979/&gt; others list only {{IPA|/ei̯/}} and {{IPA|/ou̯/}}, but some do not recognize diphthongs in Persian at all.&lt;ref name=Windfuhr1979/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alamolhoda/&gt; A major factor that complicates the matter is the change of two classical and pre-classical Persian diphthongs: {{IPA|/ai̯/ &gt; /ei̯/}} and {{IPA|/au̯/ &gt; /ou̯/}}. This shift occurred in Iran but not in some modern varieties (particularly of Afghanistan).&lt;ref name=Windfuhr1979/&gt; Morphological analysis also supports the view that the alleged Persian diphthongs are combinations of the vowels with {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.&lt;ref name=Alamolhoda/&gt;

The Persian orthography does not distinguish between the diphthongs and the consonants {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}; that is, they both are written with {{lang|fa|ی}} and {{lang|fa|و}} respectively.

{{IPA|/ou̯/}} becomes {{IPAblink|o|oː}} in the colloquial Tehran dialect but is preserved in other Western dialects and standard Iranian Persian.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In the modern Persian alphabet, the short vowels {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/æ/}} are usually left unwritten, as is normally done in [[Arabic alphabet]]. (See {{slink|Arabic phonology|Vowels}}.)

===Historical shifts===
Early New Persian inherited from [[Middle Persian]] eight vowels: three short ''i, a, u'' and five long ''ī, ē, ā, ō, ū'' (in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/i a u/}} and {{IPA|/iː eː aː oː uː/}}). It is likely that this system passed into the common Persian era from a purely quantitative system into one where the short vowels differed from their long counterparts also in quality: ''i'' &gt; {{IPAblink|ɪ}}; ''u'' &gt; {{IPAblink|ʊ}}; ''ā'' &gt; {{IPAblink|ɑː}}. These quality contrasts have in modern Persian varieties become the main distinction between the two sets of vowels.&lt;ref name="rees2008"&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Rees|first=Daniel A.|year=2008|type=Ph.D.|title=Towards Proto-Persian: An Optimality Theoretic Historical Reconstruction|chapter=From Middle Persian to Proto-Modern Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherited eight-vowel inventory is retained without major upheaval in [[Dari language|Dari]], which also preserves quantitative distinctions.&lt;ref name="rastorgueva1982"&gt;{{cite book | title=Основы иранского языкознания | year=1982 | author1=Ефимов В. А. | author2=Расторгуева B. C. | author3=Шарова Е. Н.| chapter=Персидский, таджикский, дари | volume=3. Новоиранские языки: западная группа, прикаспийские языки. | publisher=Наука | location=Moscow | pages=5—315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western Persian]], two of the vowel contrasts have been lost: those between the tense mid and close vowels. Thus ''ē'', ''ī'' have merged as {{IPAblink|i}}, while ''ō'', ''ū'' have merged as {{IPAblink|u}}. In addition, the lax close vowels have been lowered: ''i'' &gt; {{IPAblink|e}}, ''u'' &gt; {{IPAblink|o}}. The lax open vowel has become fronted: ''a'' &gt; {{IPAblink|æ}}, and in word-final position further raised to {{IPAblink|e}}. Modern Iranian Persian does not feature distinctive vowel length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Грамматика современного литературного персидского языка | year=2001 | author=Рубинчик Ю. А. | publisher=Восточная литература | location=Moscow | isbn=5-02-018177-3 | page=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both varieties ''ā'' is more or less labialized, as well as raised in Dari. Dari ''ō'' is also somewhat fronted.&lt;ref name="rastorgueva1982"/&gt;

Tajiki has also lost two of the vowel contrasts, but differently from Western Persian: here the tense/lax contrast among the close vowels has been eliminated. That is, ''i'', ''ī'' have merged as {{IPAslink|ɪ}}, and ''u'', ''ū'' have merged as {{IPAslink|ʊ}}. The other tense back vowels have shifted as well. Mid ''ō'' has shifted front: {{IPAslink|ɵ}} or {{IPAslink|ʉ}}, a vowel usually romanized as ''ů''. Open ''ā'' has been labialized and raised to an open-mid vowel {{IPAslink|ɔ}}.

Loanwords from [[Arabic]] generally undergo these changes as well.

The following chart summarizes the later shifts into modern Tajik, Dari, and Western Persian.&lt;ref name="rastorgueva1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="windfuhr1987"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World's Major Languages | year=1987 | last=Windfuhr | first=Gernot | editor=Bernard Comrie |chapter=Persian|publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | isbn=978-0-19-506511-4 | page=543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notes:

* In [[Western Persian|Iranian Persian]] {{IPAslink|ɣ}} and {{IPAslink|q}} have merged into [{{IPA link|ɣ}}~[[Voiced uvular stop|ɢ]]]; as a voiced velar fricative {{IPA|[ɣ]}} when positioned [[Intervocalic|intervocalically]] and unstressed, and as a voiced uvular stop {{IPA|[ɢ]}} otherwise.&lt;ref name="ipa_handbook2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of the International Phonetic Association: A guide to the use of the International Phonetic Alphabet|author=International Phonetic Association|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-63751-0|location=Cambridge|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jahani20052"&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistic Convergence and Areal Diffusion: Case studies from Iranian, Semitic and Turkic|last=Jahani|first=Carina|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|year=2005|isbn=0-415-30804-6|editor=Éva Ágnes Csató|location=London|pages=79–96|chapter=The Glottal Plosive: A Phoneme in Spoken Modern Persian or Not?|editor2=Bo Isaksson|editor3=Carina Jahani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thackston1993_phonology"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Persian|last=Thackston|first=W.

===Allophonic variation===
Alveolar stops {{IPAslink|t}} and {{IPAslink|d}} are either [[Apical consonant|apical]] [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]] or [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] [[Denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar]].  The [[voiceless]] [[obstruent]]s {{IPA|/{{IPA link|p}}, {{IPA link|t}}, {{IPA link|t͡ʃ}}, {{IPA link|k}}/}} are [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] much like their English counterparts: they become aspirated when they begin a syllable, though aspiration is not [[Complementary distribution|contrastive]].&lt;ref name="mahootian1997"&gt;{{cite book | title=Persian | year=1997 | last=Mahootian | first=Shahrzad | publisher=Routledge | location=London | isbn=0-415-02311-4 | pages=287, 292, 303, 305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Persian language does not have syllable-initial consonant clusters ([[#Phonotactics|see below]]), so unlike in English, {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are aspirated even following {{IPAslink|s}}, as in {{nastaliq|هستم|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈhæstæm/}} ('I exist').&lt;ref name="mace1993"&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Teach Yourself
| isbn = 0-8442-3815-5
| last = Mace
| first = John
| title = Modern Persian
| date = March 1993
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also aspirated at the end of syllables, although not as strongly.

The [[velar]] stops {{IPA|/{{IPA link|k}}, {{IPA link|ɡ}}/}} are [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] before [[front vowel]]s or at the end of a syllable.

In Classical Persian, the [[uvular]] consonants {{nastaliq|غ|fa}} and {{nastaliq|ق|fa}} denoted the original Arabic phonemes, the fricative {{IPAblink|ɣ}} and the plosive {{IPAblink|q}}, respectively. In modern [[Tehrani Persian]] (which is used in the Iranian mass media, both colloquial and standard), there is no difference in the pronunciation of {{nastaliq|غ|fa}} and {{nastaliq|ق|fa}}, and they are both normally pronounced as a voiced stop {{IPAblink|ɢ}}. The classic pronunciations of {{nastaliq|غ|fa}} and {{nastaliq|ق|fa}} are preserved in the eastern varieties, [[Dari language|Dari]] and [[Tajik language|Tajiki]], as well as in the southern varieties (e.g. [[Zoroastrian Dari language]] and other Central / Central Plateau or [[Kermanic languages]]).

The [[alveolar flap]] {{IPAslink|ɾ}} has a [[Trill (phonetics)|trilled]] allophonic variant {{IPAblink|r}} at the beginning of a word (it is sometimes a free variation between a trill {{IPA|[r]}} and a flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}});&lt;ref name="mahootian1997"/&gt; the trill {{IPA|[r]}} as a separate phoneme occurs word-medially especially in loanwords of Arabic origin as a result of gemination of {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. An [[approximant]] {{IPAblink|ɹ}} also occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/ɾ/}} before {{IPA|/t, d, s, z, ʃ, l, ʒ/}}; {{IPA|[ɹ]}} is sometimes in free variation with {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in these and other positions, such that {{nastaliq|فارسی|fa}} ('Persian') is pronounced {{IPA|[fɒːɹˈsiː]}} or {{IPA|[fɒːɾˈsiː]}} and {{lang|fa|سقرلات}} ('scarlet') {{IPA|[sæɣeɹˈlɒːt]}} or {{IPA|[sæɣeɾˈlɒːt]}}. {{IPA|/r/}} is sometimes realized as a long approximant {{IPA|[ɹː]}}.

The [[velar nasal]] {{IPAblink|ŋ}} is an allophone of {{IPAslink|n}} before {{IPA|/k, ɡ/}} 

{{IPA|/f, k, s, ʃ, x/}} may be voiced to, respectively, {{IPA|[{{IPA link|v}}, {{IPA link|ɡ}}, {{IPA link|z}}, {{IPA link|ʒ}}, {{IPA link|ɣ}}]}} before voiced consonants; {{IPA|/n/}} may be bilabial {{IPAblink|m}} before [[bilabial consonant]]s. Also {{IPA|/b/}} may in some cases change into {{IPAblink|β}}, or even {{IPAblink|v}}; for example {{nastaliq|باز|fa}} ('open') may be pronounced {{IPA|[bɒːz]}} as well as {{IPA|[βɒːz]}} or {{IPA|[vɒːz]}} and/or {{IPA|[vɒː]}}, colloquially.

===Dialectal variation===
The pronunciation of {{nastaliq|و|fa}} {{IPAblink|w}} in Classical Persian shifted to {{IPAblink|v}} in Iranian Persian and Tajik, but is retained in Dari. In modern Persian {{IPA|[w]}} may be lost if preceded by a consonant and followed by a vowel in one whole syllable, e.g. {{nastaliq|خواب|fa}} {{IPA|/xwɒb/ &gt; [xɒb]}} 'sleep', as Persian has no syllable-initial consonant clusters ([[Persian phonology#Phonotactics|see below]]).

In standard Iranian Persian, the consonants {{IPAslink|ʁ}} and {{IPAslink|ɢ}} are pronounced identically.

Consonants can be [[Gemination|geminated]], often in words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. This is represented in the IPA either by doubling the consonant, {{nastaliq|سیّد|fa}} {{lang|tg-Cyrl|саййид}} {{IPA|[sejˈjed]}}, or with the length marker {{angbr|{{IPA|ː}}}}, {{IPA|[seˈjːed]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Vrzić|first=Zvjezdana|title=Farsi: A Complete Course for Beginners|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9k_u5vnX_8C&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=farsi+geminate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WKfhEGBX20&amp;sig=8-Zn_bduPwe06d4XwRKHkrrWNYY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4FRbS6umIpXSMrSFjYUP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=farsi%20geminate&amp;f=false|year=2007|series=Living Language|page=xxiii|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4000-2347-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syllable structure===
[[Syllables]] may be structured as (C)(S)V(S)(C(C)).&lt;ref name="mahootian1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jahani2005"&gt;{{cite book | title=Linguistic Convergence and Areal Diffusion: Case studies from Iranian, Semitic and Turkic | year=2005 | last=Jahani | first=Carina | chapter=The Glottal Plosive: A Phoneme in Spoken Modern Persian or Not? | publisher=RoutledgeCurzon | editor=Éva Ágnes Csató |editor2=Bo Isaksson |editor3=Carina Jahani | location=London | isbn=0-415-30804-6 | pages=79–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian [[Syllable#Structure|syllable structure]] consists of an optional syllable onset, consisting of one consonant; an obligatory syllable nucleus, consisting of a vowel optionally preceded by and/or followed by a [[semivowel]]; and an optional syllable coda, consisting of one or two consonants.  The following restrictions apply:
* Onset
** Consonant (C): Can be any consonant. (Onset is composed only of one consonant; consonant clusters are only found in loanwords, sometimes an epenthetic {{IPA|/æ/}} is inserted between consonants.)
* Nucleus
** Semivowel (S)
** Vowel (V)
** Semivowel (S)
* Coda
** First consonant (C): Can be any consonant.
** Second consonant (C): Can also be any consonant (mostly {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, &amp; {{IPA|/z/}}).

==Word accent==
The Persian word-accent has been described as a [[Stress (linguistics)|stress accent]] by some,&lt;ref&gt;Windfuhr, Gernot  L. 1997. [http://www.linguisticsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Windfuhr-Chapter33-Persian-Phonology1.pdf]. In Kaye, Alan S. / Daniels, Peter T. (eds). ''Phonologies of Asia and Africa (including the Caucasus), I-II'', pp.675-689. Winona Lake, Eisenbrauns.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a [[pitch accent]] by others.&lt;ref&gt;Abolhasanizadeh, Vahideh, Mahmood Bijankhan, &amp; Carlos Gussenhoven, 2012. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384112001271 "The Persian pitch accent and its retention after the focus"], ''Lingua'' 122, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the accented syllables in Persian are generally pronounced with a raised pitch as well as stress; but in certain contexts words may become deaccented and lose their high pitch.&lt;ref name="IntGram"&gt;Sadat-Tehrani, Nima, 2007. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.477.667&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "The Intonational Grammar of Persian"]. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Manitoba, pp.3, 22, 46-47, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hosseini&gt;Hosseini, Seyed Ayat 2014 [http://roa.rutgers.edu/content/article/files/1314_hosseini_1.pdf "The Phonology and Phonetics of Prosodic Prominence in Persian"] Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Tokyo, p.22f for a review of the literature; also p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

From an intonational point of view, Persian words (or accentual phrases) usually have the intonation (L +) H* (where L is low and H* is a high-toned stressed syllable), e.g. {{nastaliq|کتاب|fa}} {{IPA|/keˈtɒ́b/}} 'book'; unless there is a suffix, in which case the intonation is (L +) H* + L, e.g. {{nastaliq|کتابم|fa}} {{IPA|/keˈtɒ́b-æm/}} 'my book'. The last accent of a sentence is usually accompanied by a low [[boundary tone]], which produces a falling pitch on the last accented syllable, e.g. {{nastaliq|کتاب بود|fa}} {{IPA|/keˈtɒ̂b buːd/}} 'it was a book'.&lt;ref name="IntGram" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hosseini /&gt;

When two words are joined in an {{nastaliq|اضافه|fa}} ''[[ezafe]]'' construction, they can either be pronounced accentually as two separate words, e.g. {{nastaliq|مردم اینجا|fa}} {{IPA|/mærˈdóm-e inˈd͡ʒɒ́/}} 'the people (of) here', or else the first word loses its high tone and the two words are pronounced as a single accentual phrase: {{IPA|/mærˈdom-e inˈd͡ʒɒ́/}}. Words also become deaccented following a [[Focus (linguistics)|focused]] word; for example, in the sentence {{nastaliq|نامه‌ی مامانم بود رو میز|fa}} {{IPA|/nɒˈme-ye &lt;u&gt;mɒˈmɒn&lt;/u&gt;-æm bud ru miz/}} 'it was my &lt;u&gt;mom's&lt;/u&gt; letter on the table' all the syllables following the word {{nastaliq|مامان|fa}} {{IPA|/mɒˈmɒn/}} 'mom' are pronounced with a low pitch.&lt;ref name="IntGram" /&gt;

Knowing the rules for the correct placement of the accent is essential for proper pronunciation.&lt;ref name="mace2003"&gt;{{cite book | title=Persian Grammar: For reference and revision | year=2003 | last=Mace | first=John | publisher=RoutledgeCurzon | location=London | isbn=0-7007-1695-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Accent is heard on the last stem-syllable of most words.
# Accent is heard on the first syllable of [[interjection]]s, [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] and [[vocative]]s. E.g. {{nastaliq|بله|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈbæle/}} ('yes'), {{nastaliq|نخیر|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈnæxeir/}} ('no, indeed'), {{nastaliq|ولی|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈvæli/}} ('but'), {{nastaliq|چرا|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈtʃeɾɒ}} ('why'), {{nastaliq|اگر|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈæɡæɾ/}} ('if'), {{nastaliq|مرسی|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈmeɾsi/}} ('thanks'), {{nastaliq|خانم|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈxɒnom/}} ('Ma'am'), {{nastaliq|آقا|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈɒɢɒ/}} ('Sir'); cf. '''4-4''' below.
# Never accented are:
## personal suffixes on verbs ({{IPA|/-æm/}} ('I do..'), {{IPA|/-i/}} ('you do..'), .., {{IPA|/-ænd/}} ('they do..') (with two exceptions, cf. '''4-1''' and '''5''' below);
## the possessive and pronoun-object suffixes, {{IPA|/-æm/}}, {{IPA|/-et/}}, {{IPA|/-eʃ/}}, &amp;c.
## a small set of very common noun [[enclitic]]s:  the {{IPA|/ezɒfe/}} {{nastaliq|اضافه|fa}} ({{IPA|/-e/}}, {{IPA|/-je}}) ('of'), {{IPA|/-ɾɒ/}} a definite direct object marker, {{IPA|/-i/}} ('a'), {{IPA|/-o/}} ('and');
# Always accented are:
## the personal suffixes on the positive future auxiliary verb (exception to '''3-1''' above);
## the negative verb prefix {{IPA|/næ-/}}, {{IPA|/ne-/}}, if present;
## if {{IPA|/næ-/}}, {{IPA|/ne-/}} is not present, then the first non-negative verb prefix (e.g. {{IPA|/mi-/}} ('-ing'), {{IPA|/be-/}} ('do!') or the prefix noun in compound verbs (e.g. {{nastaliq|کار|fa}} {{IPA|/kɒr/}} in {{nastaliq|کار می‌کردم|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈkɒr mi-kærdæm/}});
## the last syllable of all other words, including the infinitive ending {{IPA|/-æn/}} and the participial ending {{IPA|/-te/}}, {{IPA|/-de/}} in verbal derivatives, noun suffixes like {{IPA|/-i/}} ('-ish') and {{IPA|/-eɡi/}}, all plural suffixes ({{IPA|/-hɒ/}}, {{IPA|/-ɒn/}}), adjective comparative suffixes ({{IPA|/-tæɾ/}}, {{IPA|/-tæɾin/}}), and ordinal-number suffixes ({{IPA|/-om/}}).  Nouns not in the vocative are stressed on the final syllable: {{nastaliq|خانم|fa}} {{IPA|/xɒˈnom/}} ('lady'), {{nastaliq|آقا|fa}} {{IPA|/ɒˈɢɒ/}} ('gentleman'); cf. '''2''' above.
# In the informal language, the present perfect tense is pronounced like the simple past tense. Only the word-accent distinguishes between these tenses: the accented personal suffix indicates the present perfect and the unstressed one the simple past tense (exception to '''3-1''' above):

==Colloquial Iranian Persian==
When spoken formally, Iranian Persian is pronounced as written. But colloquial pronunciation as used by all classes makes a number of very common substitutions.  Note that Iranians can interchange colloquial and formal [[sociolect]]s in conversational speech. They include:&lt;ref name="mace2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thackston1993_colloquial"&gt;{{Cite book
| edition = 3rd Rev

| first = W. M.
| title = An Introduction to Persian
| date = 1993-05-01
| chapter = Colloquial Transformations
| pages = 205–214
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Tehran accent and also most of the accents in Central and Southern Iran, the sequence {{IPA|/ɒn/}} in the colloquial language is nearly always pronounced {{IPA|[un]}}.   The only common exceptions are high prestige words, such as {{nastaliq|قرآن|fa}} {{IPA|[ɢoɾˈʔɒn]}} ('[[Qur'an]]'), and {{nastaliq|ایران|fa}} {{IPA|[ʔiˈɾɒn]}} ('[[Iran]]'), and foreign nouns (both common and proper), like the Spanish surname {{nastaliq|بلتران|fa}} ''Beltran'' {{IPA|[belˈtɾɒn]}}, which are pronounced as written. A few words written as {{IPA|/ɒm/}} are pronounced {{IPA|[um]}}, especially forms of the verb {{nastaliq|آمدن|fa}} {{IPA|/ɒmæˈdæn/}} ('to come').
* In the Tehran accent, the unstressed direct object suffix marker {{nastaliq|را|fa}} {{IPA|/ɾɒ/}} is pronounced {{IPA|/ɾo/}} after a vowel, and {{IPA|/o/}} after a consonant.
* The 2nd and 3rd person plural [[Persian grammar#Verbs|verb subject suffixes]], written {{IPA|/-id/}} and {{IPA|/-ænd/}} respectively, are pronounced {{IPA|[-in]}} and {{IPA|[-æn]}}.
* The stems of many frequently-occurring verbs have a short colloquial form, especially {{nastaliq|است|fa}} {{IPA|/æst/}} ('he/she is'), which is colloquially shortened to {{IPA|/e/}} after a consonant or {{IPA|/s/}} after a vowel. Also, the stems of verbs which end in {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/v/}} or a vowel are shortened; e.g. {{nastaliq|می‌خواهم|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈmixɒːhæm/}} ('I want') → {{IPA|[ˈmixɒːm]}}, and {{nastaliq|می‌روم|fa}} {{IPA|/ˈmiɾævæm/}} ('I go' → {{IPA|[ˈmiɾæm]}}.

'''Punternet''', also known as '''Punternet.com''', is a [[review site]] that allows customers to rate their experiences with [[call girls]] (customers are referred to as "punters" on the website).&lt;ref name="dailydot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/culture/jon-millward-prostitutes-punternet-interview/|title=A British author analyzes what traits men seek in prostitutes|date=26 October 2011|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21611074?cid1=d/dsp/Outbrain/dyn/21611074/20150520-00:00am/paid/display-LA/BR-LC/BRPII/none/subs/UK/BR-MIT |title=More bang for your buck |journal=The Economist |date=2014-08-09 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/511425/Punternet-prostitute-reviews-Uk-Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Harriet-Harman-escort-sex-addicts|title=STRIP ADVISOR: Brit sex addicts leaving escort reviews on site even Arnie couldn't kill|date=1 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The site offers free membership. Free members can submit reviews and access site features and a limited search function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2014/11/invisible-subjects-men-who-fuel-demand-prostitution|title=Invisible subjects: the men who fuel the demand for prostitution|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailydot.com"/&gt; 

The site was sold in August 2017 and the new owners dropped the [[discussion boards]] from the site.&lt;ref name="pnet"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.punternet.com/index.php/ownership |title= Change of Ownership |last= |first= |date= August 2017 |website= Punternet UK |publisher= |access-date= 12 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also changed the site's policy to allow male and transgender service providers to advertise and be reviewed (previously this was limited to female escorts only).&lt;ref name="pnet" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The site has been met with criticism, most notably in 2009 from [[Harriet Harman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/01/us-prostitutes-idUSTRE5905CU20091001|title= Schwarzenegger asked to close prostitute Website|publisher= Reuters |date= 2009-10-01|accessdate=2013-11-26 |first=Stefano |last=Ambrogi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harman, who was the [[Minister for Women and Equality]] at the time, asked then California governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] to ban the website, as it was based in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8282626.stm|title= Terminate degrading site - Harma|publisher= BBC |date= 2009-09-30|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web owners thanked Harriet for increasing web traffic to their site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/05/punternet_harman/|title= PunterNet thanks Harriet for massive upswing|publisher= Register |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/26/punternet_baird/|title= Solicitor General takes fresh pop at PunterNet|publisher= Register |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/punter-net-prostitutes-thank-harriet-harman-for-publicity-boost-1796759.html|title= Punter Net prostitutes thank Harriet Harman for publicity boost|publisher= Independent |date= 2009-10-02|accessdate=2013-11-26 |location=London |first=Jerome |last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Trishna Datta, an [[outreach]] worker from [[Ilford]], Essex, launched a petition to have the Punternet website taken down. She said that website lacked adequate safety measures to ensure details which could put sex workers in danger were not revealed. Additionally she expressed concern that some of the sex workers reviewed on the site might be underage or victims of trafficking or sexual assault. Punternet commented that they would report underage prostitutes to the authorities, and that they encourage customers to report underage prostitutes and victims of trafficking to [[Crimestoppers UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Metro|title=There’s a vile website that lets people review prostitutes and ‘victims of trafficking’|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/04/theres-a-vile-website-that-lets-people-review-prostitutes-and-victims-of-trafficking-8006330/|author=Martine Berg Olsen|date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Ilford Recorder|title=‘Prostitute Tripadvisor’: Campaign to close down website in which punters rate and review Ilford, Goodmayes and South Woodford sex workers|url=https://www.ilfordrecorder.co.uk/news/prostitute-tripadvisor-campaign-to-close-down-website-in-which-punters-rate-and-review-ilford-goodmayes-and-south-woodford-sex-workers-1-5721992|author=Ellena Cruse|date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49368">The [[Shroud of Turin]], a [[linen]] cloth that tradition associates with the crucifixion and burial of [[Jesus]], has undergone numerous scientific tests, the most notable of which is [[radiocarbon dating]], in an attempt to determine the [[relic]]'s authenticity. In 1988, scientists at three separate laboratories dated samples from the Shroud to a range of 1260–1390 AD, which coincides with the first certain appearance of the shroud in the 1350s and is much later than the burial of Jesus in 30 or 33 AD.&lt;ref name="Damon et al 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/337611a0 |title=Radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin |journal=Nature |volume=337 |issue=6208 |pages=611–5 |year=1989 |last1=Damon |first1=P.

==Background==

===1978: the creation of S.Tu.R.P.===
The idea of scientifically dating the shroud had first been proposed in the 1960s, but permission had been refused because the procedure at the time would have required the destruction of too much fabric (almost 0.05 sq m ≅ 0.538 sq ft). The development in the 1970s of new techniques for radio-carbon dating, which required much lower quantities of source material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1021/ba-1988-0220.ch016 |chapter=Carbon Dating the Shroud of Turin |title=Archaeological Chemistry IV |volume=220 |pages=313–20 |series=Advances in Chemistry |year=1989 |last1=Harbottle |first1=Garman |last2=Heino |first2=Walden |isbn=0-8412-1449-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; prompted the Catholic Church to found the ''[[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]'' (S.Tu.R.P.), which involved about 30 scientists of various religious faiths, including non-Christians.

The S.Tu.R.P. group initially planned to conduct a range of different studies on the cloth, including radio-carbon dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1364/ao.19.001909 |pmid=20221154 |title=Scientific investigation of the Shroud of Turin |journal=Applied Optics |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1909–12 |year=1980 |last1=Jumper |first1=Eric J. |last2=Mottern |first2=Robert W. |bibcode=1980ApOpt..19.1909J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jumper, E.J. - An Overview of the Testing Performed by the Shroud of Turin Research Project with a Summary of Results - IEEE 1982 Proceedings of the International Conference on Cybernetics and Society, October 1982, pp. 535-537.&lt;/ref&gt; A commission headed by chemist [[Robert H. Dinegar]] and physicist [[Harry E. Gove]] consulted numerous laboratories which were able at the time (1982) to carbon-date small fabric samples. The six labs that showed interest in performing the procedure fell into two categories, according to the method they utilised:
*Two used a [[proportional counter]] approach:
**[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], [[Upton, New York|Upton]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States;
**[[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]], [[Harwell]], [[Oxfordshire]], UK;
*Four used [[accelerator mass spectrometry]]:
**[[Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory]], [[University of Rochester]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], New York, USA;
**the [[University of Oxford]], UK;
**[[University of Arizona]], [[Tucson, Arizona]], USA;
** [[ETH Zürich]], Switzerland.
To obtain independent and replicable results, and to avoid conflict between the laboratories, it was decided to let all interested laboratories perform the tests at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Patruno. ''E quel falso lenzuolo diventò un business. La Repubblica, October 15, 1988, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disagreements between S.Tu.R.P. and  candidate laboratories===
In 1982, the S.Tu.R.P. group published the list of tests to be performed on the shroud; these aimed to identify how the image was impressed onto the cloth, to verify the relic's purported origin, and to identify better-suited conservation methods. However, a disagreement between the S.Tu.R.P. group and the candidate laboratories turned into a P.R. rift:&lt;ref&gt;Schafersman, S. D. - Are the STURP scientists pseudoscientists? - The Microscope 30 No.3, 1982, pp. 232-34.&lt;/ref&gt; the S.Tu.R.P. group expected to perform the [[Radiometer|radiometric examination]] under its own aegis and after the other examinations had been completed, while the laboratories considered radio-carbon dating to be the prime test, which should be completed at the detriment of other tests, if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Power, B.A. - Implications of Energy Compressibility for Shroud of Turin Image-Process and Carbon-14 Dating - Typescript - Dorval, Quebec, Canada, Jan. 20, 1984, pp. 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1986 Turin protocol===
A meeting with ecclesiastic authorities took place on September 29, 1986, to determine the way forward. In the end, a compromise solution was reached with the so-called "Turin protocol",&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, P. - Art Historian Not Convinced the Shroud is a Fake - Our Sunday Visitor, Oct. 23, 1988, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, P. - Shroud of Turin to Undergo Radiocarbon Testing - Our Sunday Visitor, Feb. 14, 1988, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; which stated that:
*carbon-dating would be the only test performed;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Meachum, W. | title=Radiocarbon Measurement and the Age of the Turin Shroud: Possibilities and Uncertainties | journal = Shroud Spectrum International | year = 1986 | volume = 19 | issue =  | pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*original and control samples, indistinguishable from each other, would be provided ([[blind test]]);
*the test would be performed concurrently by seven&lt;ref&gt;Nell'occasione si era aggiunto ai candidati anche il [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|laboratorio francese]] di [[Gif-sur-Yvette]].&lt;/ref&gt; laboratories, under the joint supervision of the Pontifical Academy of Science, the archbishop of Turin, and the British Museum;
*both dating methods would be adopted;&lt;ref&gt;Terrasi, F. - Lettera - Sulla datazione del carbonio-14 - Didattica delle Scienze, No. 149, Ottobre 1990, pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Haelst, R. - Radiocarbon dating and the Shroud of Turin - Typescript, Symposium Scientifique International de Paris sur le Linceul de Turin, 7-8 Septembre 1989, pp. 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the sample offered to each laboratory would weight 28&amp;nbsp;mg, in total equivalent to 9 sq. cm. of cloth;&lt;ref name= lemberg&gt;Mechtilde Flury-Lemberg, esperta mondiale in [[tessuto|tessuti]] appartenente alla Fondazione Abegg di [[Bern]]a. In altre occasioni verrà chiamata per eseguire studi sul lenzuolo; in particolare nel 2000 fece parte di una commissione creata per studiare i metodi migliori per la conservazione del lino; nel 2002 ha eseguito alcuni studi sulle toppe che coprivano i buchi causati dall'incendio di Chambery.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the British Museum would manage the distribution of the samples;
*laboratories would not communicate with each other during the analysis, nor divulge the results of the tests to anyone but the three supervising authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Prestipino, C.A. - Il carbonio-14 e la S. Sindone - Didattica delle Scienze, No. 147, Aprile 1990, pp. 16-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prestipino, C.A. - Replica - Sulla datazione del carbonio-14 - Didattica delle Scienze, No. 149, Ottobre 1990, pp. 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vatican subsequently decided to adopt a different protocol instead.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, I. - Vatican undermines tests on Turin shroud - New Scientist, January 21, 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On April 27, 1987, a Vatican spokesperson announced to the newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' that the procedure would likely be performed by two or three laboratories at most;
*On October 10, Cardinal [[Anastasio Ballestrero]] officially announced to the seven laboratories that the proportional counter method would not be used because this method would require too much Shroud material (gram quantities rather than milligram quantities).&lt;ref&gt;White, N.R., D. Phil Thesis, Oxford, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Oosterwyck-Gastuche, M.-C. - Age medieval du Linceul de Turin: Les étapes d'un bluff technologique - Science et Foi- Les Nouvelles du CESHE (Cercle Scientifique et Historique, Tournai, Belgique), No. 19, 1eme trimestre 1991, pp. 11-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Only three laboratories, namely Oxford, Tucson, and Zürich, would be provided with Shroud samples to be tested.
*The sole supervising institution would be the British Museum, headed by Dr Michael Tite.
These deviations  were heavily criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Raloff, J. - Controversy Builds as Shroud Tests Near - Science News, April 16, 1988, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The blind-test method was abandoned, because the distinctive three-to-one herringbone twill weave of the shroud could not be matched in the controls, and it was therefore still possible for a laboratory to identify the shroud sample.  Shredding the samples would not solve the problem, while making it much more difficult and wasteful to clean the samples properly.&lt;ref name="autogenerated611"&gt;Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin, Damon et al, Nature, Vol. 337, No. 6208, pp. 611-615, 16th February, 1989,&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Harry Gove, director of Rochester's laboratory (one of the four not selected by the Vatican), argued in an open letter published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/333110c0 |title=Radiocarbon-dating the shroud |journal=Nature |volume=333 |issue=6169 |pages=110 |year=1988 |last1=Gove |first1=H. E. |bibcode=1988Natur.333..110G }}&lt;/ref&gt; that discarding the blind-test method would expose the results – whatever they may be – to suspicion of unreliability. However, in a 1990 paper Gove conceded that the "arguments often raised, … that radiocarbon measurements on the shroud should be performed blind seem to the author to be lacking in merit; … lack of blindness in the measurements is a rather insubstantial reason for disbelieving the result."&lt;ref name=Gove1990&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033822200039990 |title=Dating the Turin Shroud—An Assessment |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=32 |pages=87 |year=2016 |last1=Gove |first1=H E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the heated debate that followed, a Church's spokesperson declared that {{quote|(t)he Church must respond to the challenge of those who want it to stop the process, who would want us to show that the Church fears the science. &lt;br/&gt;We are faced with actual blackmail: unless we accept the conditions imposed by the laboratories, they will start a marketing campaign of accusations against the Church, which they will portray as scared of the truth and enemy of science. [...] &lt;br/&gt;The pressure on the ecclesiastic authorities to accept the Turin protocol have almost approached illegality.|Luigi Gonella&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sindone.info/VHAELST6.PDF Radiocarbon dating the shroud of Turin A critical review of the Nature report (authored by Damon et al.) with a complete unbiased statistical analysis], Remi Van Haelst, Collegamento pro Sindone Internet - ottobre 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The final protocol===
The proposed changes to the Turin protocol sparked another heated debate among scientists, and the sampling procedure was postponed.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous - Shroud Dating Isn't Ironed Out - Science News, 1987, 132, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 1988, ten years after the S.Tu.R.P. project had been initiated, British Museum scientific director Michael Tite published in Nature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/332482c0 |pmid=3357508 |title=Turin Shroud |journal=Nature |volume=332 |issue=6164 |pages=482 |year=1988 |last1=Tite |first1=M. S. |bibcode=1988Natur.332..482T }}&lt;/ref&gt; the "final" protocol:
*the laboratories at Oxford, Zürich, and Tucson would perform the test;
*they would each receive one sample weighing 40&amp;nbsp;mg., sampled from a single portion of weave;
*the laboratories would each receive two control samples, clearly distinguishable from the shroud sample;
*samples would be delivered to the laboratories' representatives in Turin;
*each test would be filmed;
*there would be no comparison of results (nor communication) between laboratories until the results be certified as definitive, univocal, and complete;
*the proportional counter method would not be used because it required gram quantities rather than milligram quantities of shroud material.

Among the most obvious differences between the final version of the protocol and the previous ones stands the decision to sample from a single location on the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Marino, J.G., and Benford, M.S. (2000). Evidence for the Skewing of the C-14 Dating of the Shroud of Turin Due to Repairs.&lt;/ref&gt; This is  significant because, should the chosen portion be in any way not representative of the remainder of the shroud, the results would only be applicable to that portion of the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Marino, J. - The Shroud of Turin and the Carbon 14 Controversy - Fidelity, Feb. 1989, pp. 36-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further, relevant difference was the deletion of the blind test, considered by some scholars as the very foundation of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Van Oosterwyck-Gastuche, M.-C. - Le Sain Suaire et le radiocarbone - Sel de la Terre, No. 20, Printemps 1997, pp. 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Oosterwyck-Gastuche, M.-C. -Que penser des ages radiocarbone? - Science et Foi- Les Nouvelles du CESHE (Cercle Scientifique et Historique, Tournai, Belgique), No. 30, 4eme trimestre 1993, pp. 23-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whanger, A.D. - Whanger, M. - Comments on the C-14 Carbon Dating Results on the Shroud of Turin - Typescript, Sept. 29, 1988, pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The blind-test method was abandoned because the distinctive three-to-one herringbone twill weave of the shroud could not be matched in the controls, and a laboratory could thus identify the shroud sample.  Shredding the samples would not solve the problem, while making it much more difficult and wasteful to clean the samples properly.&lt;ref name="autogenerated611"/&gt;

==Testing process==

===Sampling===
Samples were taken on April 21, 1988, in the [[Turin Cathedral|Cathedral]] by [[Franco Testore]], an expert on weaves and fabrics, and by Giovanni Riggi, a representative of the maker of bio-equipment "Numana". Testore performed the weighting operations while Riggi made the actual cut. Also present were Cardinal Ballestrero, four priests, archdiocese spokesperson Luigi Gonella, photographers, a camera operator, Michael Tite of the British Museum, and the labs' representatives.

As a precautionary measure, a piece twice as big as the one required by the protocol was cut from the Shroud; it measured {{convert|81|x|21|mm|2|abbr=on}}. An outer strip showing coloured filaments of uncertain origin was discarded.&lt;ref&gt;The Crucifixion of Jesus, Completely Revised and Expanded: A Forensic Inquiry
By Frederick T. Zugibe, pg 322, at [https://books.google.co.za/books?id=naV1ua58ZQ8C&amp;pg=PA322&amp;lpg=PA322&amp;dq=Giorgio+Tessiore,+presence+of+different+color+threads&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TFcPWQS4qa&amp;sig=-OK-C4ylEEUi647HrolyCtr7o8o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsnuiXprvXAhUKLVAKHSlYDHAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Giorgio%20Tessiore%2C%20presence%20of%20different%20color%20threads&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining sample, measuring {{convert|81|x|16|mm|2|abbr=on}} and weighing 300&amp;nbsp;mg, was first divided in two equal parts, one of which was preserved in a sealed container, in the custody of the Vatican, in case of future need. The other half was cut into three segments, and packaged for the labs in a separate room by Dr Tite and the archbishop. The lab representatives were not present at this packaging process, in accordance with the protocol.

The labs were also each given three control samples (one more than originally intended), that were:
*a fragment of weave coming from an Egyptian burial, discovered in 1964 and already carbon-dated to 1100 AD.;
*a piece of mummy bandage carbon-dated to 200 AD;
*a sample of the cloak having belonged to [[Louis IX of France]] and preserved in [[Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume|Saint-Maximin]], [[Var (department)|Var]], France, which had a verifiable provenance and was woven between 1240 and 1270.

===Completion of tests===
Tucson performed the tests in May, Zürich in June, and Oxford in August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1994.tb00975.x |title=Radiocarbon Dates from the Oxford Ams System: Archaeometry Datelist 18 |journal=Archaeometry |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=337 |year=1994 |last1=Hedges |first1=R. E. M. |last2=Housley |first2=R. A. |last3=Ramsey |first3=C. Bronk |last4=Van Klinken |first4=G. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and communicated their results to the British Museum.

On September 28, 1988, British Museum director and coordinator of the study Michael Tite communicated the official results to the Diocese of Turin and to the [[Holy See]].

===Official announcement===
In a well-attended press conference on October 13, Cardinal Ballestrero announced the official results, i.e. that radio-carbon testing dated the shroud to a date of 1260-1390 AD, with 95% confidence. The official and complete report on the experiment was published in ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="Damon et al 1989"/&gt; The uncalibrated dates from the individual laboratories, with 1-sigma errors (68% confidence), were as follows:
*Tucson: 646 ± 31 years;
*Oxford: 750 ± 30 years;
*Zürich: 676 ± 24 years old;
*the unweighted mean was "691 ± 31 years", which corresponds to calibrated ages of "1273 - 1288 AD" with 68% confidence, and "1262 - 1312, 1353 - 1384 AD cal" with 95% confidence.
As reported in ''Nature'', Professor Bray of the Instituto di Metrologia 'G. Colonetti', Turin, "confirmed that the results of the three laboratories were mutually compatible, and that, on the evidence submitted, none of the mean results was questionable."&lt;ref name="Damon et al 1989"/&gt;

==Criticisms of the test results==

===Medieval repairs===
Although the quality of the radiocarbon testing itself is unquestioned, criticisms have been raised regarding the choice of the sample taken for testing, with suggestions that the sample may represent a medieval repair fragment rather than the image-bearing cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/352187d0 |title=Sampling error? |journal=Nature |volume=352 |issue=6332 |pages=187 |year=1991 |last1=Busson |first1=Pierre |bibcode=1991Natur.352..187B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John L.

These included an article by American chemist [[Raymond Rogers]], who conducted chemical analysis for the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]] and who was involved in work with the Shroud since the STURP project began in 1978. Rogers took 32 documented adhesive-tape samples from all areas of the shroud and associated textiles during the STURP process in 1978.&lt;ref name="Raymond N. Rogers 2004"/&gt; He received 14 yarn segments from Prof. Luigi Gonella (from the Department of Physics, at the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]]) on 14 October 1979, which Gonellla told him were from the Raes sample. On 12 December 2003, Rogers received samples of both warp and weft threads that Prof. Luigi Gonella claimed to have taken from the radiocarbon sample before it was distributed for dating. The actual provenance of these threads is uncertain, as Gonella was not authorized to take or retain genuine shroud material,&lt;ref name="freeinquiry1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://llanoestacado.org/freeinquiry/skeptic/shroud/articles/rogers-ta-response.htm |title=A Skeptical Response to ''Studies on the Radiocarbon Sample from the Shroud of Turin'' by Raymond N.

Rogers 2004"/&gt;

Raymond Rogers stated in a 2005 article that he performed chemical analyses on these undocumented threads, and compared them to the undocumented Raes threads as well as the samples he had kept from his STURP work. He stated that his analysis showed: "The radiocarbon sample contains both a gum/dye/mordant coating and cotton fibers. The main part of the shroud does not contain these materials."&lt;ref name="Raymond N. Rogers 2004"/&gt; He speculated that these products may have been used by medieval weavers to match the colour of the original weave when performing repairs and backing the shroud for additional protection. Based on this comparison Rogers concluded that the undocumented threads received from Gonella did not match the main body of the shroud, and that in his opinion: "The worst possible sample for carbon dating was taken."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/5137163/Turin-Shroud-could-be-genuine-as-carbon-dating-was-flawed.html ''Turin Shroud 'could be genuine as carbon-dating was flawed''] Stephen Adams in the [[Daily Telegraph]] 10 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the testing process in 1988, Derbyshire laboratory in the UK assisted the Oxford University radiocarbon acceleration unit by identifying foreign material removed from the samples before they were processed.&lt;ref name='Textile Horizons'&gt;[http://www.sindone.info/TEXTILE.PDF Rogue fibres foundin the Shroud] Textile Horizons, December 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Edward Hall of the Oxford team noticed two or three "minute" fibers which looked "out of place",&lt;ref name="Textile Horizons" /&gt; and those "minute" fibers were identified as cotton by Peter South (textile expert of the Derbyshire laboratory) who said: "It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven. It may not have taken us long to identify the strange material, but it was unique amongst the many and varied jobs we undertake.” &lt;ref name="Textile Horizons" /&gt;

The official report of the dating process, written by the people who performed the sampling, states that the sample "came from a single site on the main body of the shroud away from any patches or charred areas."&lt;ref name="Damon et al 1989"/&gt;

Mechthild Flury-Lemberg is an expert in the restoration of textiles, who headed the restoration and conservation of the Turin Shroud in 2002. She has rejected the theory of the "invisible reweaving", pointing out that it would be technically impossible to perform such a repair without leaving traces, and that she found no such traces in her study of the shroud.&lt;ref&gt;The Shroud, by Ian Wilson; Random House, 2010, pgs 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The Invisible Mending of the Shroud, the Theory and the Reality; by Mechthild Flury-Lemberg, at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n65part5.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Harry E. Gove, former professor emeritus of physics at the University of Rochester and former director of the Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory at the University of Rochester, helped to invent radiocarbon dating and was closely involved in setting up the shroud dating project. He also attended the actual dating process at the University of Arizona. Gove has written (in the respected scientific journal [[Radiocarbon (journal)|Radiocarbon]]) that: "Another argument has been made that the part of the shroud from which the sample was cut had possibly become worn and threadbare from countless handlings and had been subjected to medieval textile restoration. If so, the restoration would have had to be done with such incredible virtuosity as to render it microscopically indistinguishable from the real thing. Even modern so-called invisible weaving can readily be detected under a microscope, so this possibility seems unlikely. It seems very convincing that what was measured in the laboratories was genuine cloth from the shroud after it had been subjected to rigorous cleaning procedures. Probably no sample for carbon dating has ever been subjected to such scrupulously careful examination and treatment, nor perhaps ever will again."&lt;ref name=Gove1990/&gt;

In 2010, professors of statistics Marco Riani and Anthony C. Atkinson wrote in a scientific paper that the statistical analysis of the raw dates obtained from the three laboratories for the radiocarbon test suggests the presence of contamination in some of the samples. They conclude that: "The effect is not large over the sampled region; … our estimate of the change is about two centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Riani M., Atkinson A.C., Fanti G., Crosilla F., (4 May 2010).

[[The London School of Economics and Political Science]]. Retrieved 2010-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Professor [[A.J. Timothy Jull|Timothy Jull]], a member of the original 1988 radiocarbon-dating team and editor of the peer-reviewed journal ''Radiocarbon'', coauthored an article in that journal with Rachel A Freer-Waters. They examined a portion of the radiocarbon sample that was left over from the section used by the University of Arizona in 1988 for the carbon dating exercise, and were assisted by the director of the Gloria F Ross Center for Tapestry Studies. They viewed the fragment using a low magnification (~30×) stereomicroscope, as well as under high magnification (320×) viewed through both transmitted light and polarized light, and then with epifluorescence microscopy. They found "only low levels of contamination by a few cotton fibers" and no evidence that the samples actually used for measurements in the C14 dating processes were dyed, treated, or otherwise manipulated. They concluded that the radiocarbon dating had been performed on a sample of the original shroud material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033822200056277 |title=Investigating a Dated Piece of the Shroud of Turin |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=1521 |year=2016 |last1=Freer-Waters |first1=Rachel A |last2=Timothy Jull |first2=A J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermal measurement at the [[University of Padua]], conducted a battery of experiments on various threads that he believes were cut from the shroud during the 1988 Carbon-14 dating, and concluded that they dated from 300 BC to 400 AD, potentially placing the Shroud within the lifetime of Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/28/shroud-of-turin-real-jesus_n_2971850.html |title=Shroud Of Turin Real?

If you’re using old techniques in new ways, then you need to submit your approach to other scientists."&lt;ref name="ncregister.com"/&gt;

===Contrasting evidence===
Raymond Rogers &lt;ref name="Raymond N. Rogers 2004"/&gt; argued in the scientific journal ''Thermochimica Acta'' that the presence of [[vanillin]] differed markedly between the unprovenanced threads he was looking at, which contained 37% of the original vanillin, while the body of the shroud contained 0% of the original vanillin. He stated that: "The fact that vanillin cannot be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead Sea scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicate that the shroud is quite old. A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggest the shroud is between 1300 and 3000 years old. Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years".&lt;ref name="Raymond N. Rogers 2004"/&gt;

It has been stated that Roger’s vanillin-dating process is untested, and the validity thereof is suspect, as the deterioration of vanillin is heavily influenced by the temperature of its environment – heat strips away vanillin rapidly, and the shroud has been subjected to temperatures high enough to melt silver and scorch the cloth.&lt;ref name="freeinquiry1" /&gt; Rogers' analysis is also questioned by skeptics such as [[Joe Nickell]], who reasons that the conclusions of the author, [[Raymond Rogers]], result from "starting with the desired conclusion and working backward to the evidence".&lt;ref name="Joe Nickell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/claims_of_invalid_ldquoshroudrdquo_radiocarbon_date_cut_from_whole_cloth/ |title=Claims of Invalid "Shroud" Radiocarbon Date Cut from Whole Cloth |accessdate=2009-10-06 |author=[[Joe Nickell]] |work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contamination by bacteria===
Pictorial evidence dating from c. 1690 and 1842 indicates that the corner used for the dating and several similar evenly spaced areas along one edge of the cloth were handled each time the cloth was displayed, the traditional method being for it to be held suspended by a row of five bishops. Others contend that repeated handling of this kind greatly increased the likelihood of contamination by bacteria and bacterial residue compared to the newly discovered archaeological specimens for which carbon-14 dating was developed. Bacteria and associated residue (bacteria by-products and dead bacteria) carry additional carbon-14 that would skew the radiocarbon date toward the present.

Rodger Sparks, a radiocarbon expert from New Zealand, had countered that an error of thirteen centuries stemming from bacterial contamination in the Middle Ages would have required a layer approximately doubling the sample weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shroud.com/c14debat.htm |title=Debate of Roger Sparks and William Meacham on alt.turin-shroud |publisher=Shroud.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because such material could be easily detected, fibers from the shroud were examined at the National Science Foundation Mass Spectrometry Center of Excellence at the University of Nebraska. Pyrolysis-mass-spectrometry examination failed to detect any form of bioplastic polymer on fibers from either non-image or image areas of the shroud. Additionally, laser-microprobe [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] analysis at Instruments SA, Inc. in Metuchen, New Jersey, also failed to detect any bioplastic polymer on shroud fibers.

Professor Harry Gove, director of Rochester's laboratory (one of the laboratories not selected to conduct the testing), once hypothesised that a "bioplastic" bacterial contamination, which was unknown during the 1988 testing, could have rendered the tests inaccurate. He has however also acknowledged that the samples had been carefully cleaned with strong chemicals before testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Meacham| first = William |  title = From the Proceedings of the Symposium "Turin Shroud - Image of Christ?"| date = 1 March 1986| url = http://www.shroud.com/meacham.htm|accessdate =14 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that different cleaning procedures were employed by and within the three laboratories, and that even if some slight contamination remained, about two thirds of the sample would need to consist of modern material to swing the result away from a 1st Century date to a Medieval date. He inspected the Arizona sample material before it was cleaned, and determined that no such gross amount of contamination was present even before the cleaning commenced.&lt;ref name=Gove1990/&gt;

===Contamination by reactive carbon===
Others have suggested that  the silver of the molten reliquary and the water used to douse the flames may have catalysed the airborne carbon into the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Moroni, M. &amp; van Haelst, R. – ‘'Natural Factors Affecting the Apparent Radiocarbon Age of Textiles’’.

Jull, Donahue and Damon of the NSF Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometer Facility at the University of Arizona attempted to replicate the Kouznetsov experiment, and could find no evidence for the gross changes in age proposed by Kouznetsov et al.

===Contamination by smoke===
In 2008 Dr John Jackson of the Turin Shroud Center of Colorado proposed a new hypothesis – namely the possibility of more recent enrichment if carbon monoxide were to slowly interact with a fabric so as to deposit its enriched carbon into the fabric, interpenetrating into the fibrils that make up the cloth. Jackson proposed to test if this were actually possible.&lt;ref name="c14.arch.ox.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/embed.php?File=shroud.html |title=ORAU - Shroud of Turin |publisher=C14.arch.ox.ac.uk |date=2008-03-22 |accessdate=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Christopher Ramsey]], the director of the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, took the theory seriously and agreed to collaborate with Jackson in testing a series of linen samples that could determine if the case for the Shroud's authenticity should be re-opened. Before conducting the tests, he told the BBC that "With the radiocarbon measurements and with all of the other evidence which we have about the Shroud, there does seem to be a conflict in the interpretation of the different evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Omaar |first=Rageh |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7307646.stm |title=Science/Nature &amp;#124; Shroud mystery 'refuses to go away' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-03-21 |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ramsey stressed that he would be surprised if the results of the 1988 tests were shown to be far out – especially "a thousand years wrong" – but he insisted that he was keeping an open mind.&lt;ref&gt;Fresh tests on Shroud of Turin; By Jonathan Petre; Religion Correspondent; The Telegraph; 25 Feb 2008 at - https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579810/Fresh-tests-on-Shroud-of-Turin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the tests were to form part of a documentary on the Turin Shroud which was to be broadcast on BBC2. The producer of the 2008 documentary, David Rolfe, suggested that the quantity of carbon 14 found on the weave may have been significantly affected by the weather, the conservation methods employed throughout the centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Chickos, J.S., and Uang, J. (2001). Chemical Modification of Cellulose.  The Possible Effects of Chemical Cleaning on Fatty Acids Incorporated in Old Textiles  (St. Louis MO, Department of Chemistry - University of Missouri-St. Louis).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the volatile carbon generated by the fire that damaged the shroud while in Savoy custody at [[Chambéry]]. Other similar theories include that  candle smoke (rich in carbon dioxide) and the volatile carbon molecules produced during the two fires may have altered the carbon content of the cloth, rendering carbon-dating unreliable as a dating tool.&lt;ref&gt;Brunati, E. - Note critiche sulla datazione della S.Sindone con il radiocarbonio - Typescript, Gennaio 1994, pp. 1-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardamone-Blacksburg, J. - La cellulosa dal lino; caratterizzazione e datazione - Typescript, Symposium Scientifique International de Paris sur le Linceul de Turin, 7-8 Septembre 1989, pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008 Professor Ramsey reported back on the testing that: "So far the linen samples have been subjected to normal conditions (but with very high concentrations of carbon monoxide). These initial tests show no significant reaction – even though the sensitivity of the measurements is sufficient to detect contamination that would offset the age by less than a single year. This is to be expected and essentially confirms why this sort of contamination has not been considered a serious issue before." He noted that carbon monoxide does not undergo significant reactions with linen which could result in an incorporation of a significant number of CO molecules into the cellulose structure. He also added that there is as yet no direct evidence to suggest the original radiocarbon dates are not accurate.&lt;ref name="c14.arch.ox.ac.uk"/&gt;

In 2011, Ramsey commented that in general "there are various hypotheses as to why the dates might not be correct, but none of them stack up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100125247/the-turin-shroud-is-fake-get-over-it/ ''The Turin Shroud is fake. Get over it''] Tom Chivers in the [[Daily Telegraph]] 20 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incorrect calculations===
In 1994, J. A. Christen applied a strong statistical test to the radiocarbon data and concluded that the given age for the shroud is, from a statistical point of view, correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2986273 |jstor=2986273 |title=Summarizing a Set of Radiocarbon Determinations: A Robust Approach |journal=Applied Statistics |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=489 |year=1994 |last1=Christen |first1=J. Andres }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However critics claim to have identified statistical errors in the conclusions published in ''Nature'':&lt;ref name="Damon et al 1989"/&gt; including: the actual standard deviation for the Tucson study was 17 years, not 31, as published; the chi-square distribution value is 8.6 rather than 6.4, and the relative significance level (which measures the reliability of the results) is close to 1% – rather than the published 5%, which is the minimum acceptable threshold.&lt;ref&gt;Fanti, G., and Marinelli, E.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2013}}
In [[fantasy fiction]], a [[revenant]] is a sentient creature whose desire to fulfill a special goal allows it to return from the grave as a creature vaguely resembling an intelligent [[zombie]] or [[jiangshi]]. Another possibility is that a powerful [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] returns a dead [[hero]] from the past to make him go on a quest that no living human would dare to undertake. Such a revenant may be just as intelligent as it was in life but its will is usually bound by the wizard who summons and controls it.

[[Merriam-Webster]]'s definition of revenant is "one that returns after death or a long absence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/revenant "revenant"]. ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]''. Retrieved January 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In that the subject returns from death, one can easily see an association of the term with the undead in fantasy and horror fiction.  On the other hand, unlike zombies, the revenant's "long absence" does imply a certain [[anachronism]] in its eventual return.
The term often implies some underlying motive of revenge prompting the return.

Revenants exist primarily in [[role-playing game]]s, [[fantasy fiction]], [[science fiction]], and [[horror fiction]].

==Examples in fiction==
* The main character in ''Dreams of Darkness'' by Barry James is a revenant fighting a collective god, the Mondragoran, to prevent the apocalypse.
* In [[Peter Straub]]'s ''Ghost Story,'' the female ghost is a revenant as declared by the protagonist. The revenant manifests itself throughout time and space at will and as different personalities to fulfill its mission of vengeance. In ''Ghost Story,'' the revenant manifests as Angie Maul, a young girl; and Anna Mostyn, an attractive young lady, to wreak havoc on the nephew of one of the original victims.  Ann-Veronica Moore attacks the original victims and in life was known as Eva Galli.
* In [[Laurell K. Hamilton]]'s ''[[Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter]]'' series, revenants are animalistic vampires who were violently killed by a group of vampires (rather than being turned in the traditional 3-day period).
* In the ''Die For Me'' series by [[Amy Plum]], there are two kinds of revenants. When people die saving someone they become Bardia, who call themselves revenants, and when people die betraying someone, they become Numa. They are described as devastatingly attractive and depend on humans for their existence.
* [[EC Comics]], in particular with their horror series such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''[[The Vault of Horror (comics)|The Vault of Horror]]'', and ''[[The Haunt of Fear]]'', often made use of revenant-like characters as a plot device, and in a manner consistent with the theme of an individual coming back from the grave to fulfill a specific task.  Example stories which contain this theme include "The Thing From The Grave!" (''Tales From The Crypt'' #22), "None But The Lonely Heart" (''Tales From The Crypt'' #33), and "'Til Death" (''The Vault of Horror'' #27), among others.
* In the [[Wildstorm]] comic series ''[[Victorian Undead]]: Sherlock Holmes vs Zombies'', [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Doctor Watson]] must deal with a [[zombie outbreak]], which is led by [[Professor Moriarty]] who is a revenant.
* In [[DC Comic]]'s "[[Blackest Night]]" story arc, the [[Black Lantern Corps]] consists primarily of reanimated deceased [[superheroes]] and [[supervillains]] from the fictional universe of [[New Earth (DC Comics)|New Earth]] in the [[DC Multiverse]].
* In the second book in Brandon Mull's series ''[[Fablehaven]]'', a revenant guards an ancient magical item.  It is described as a zombie-like creature with disheveled clothing and a nail sticking in its neck.  In addition, it creates an intense irrational fear in all who approach it, and causes those whom it chokes to it to turn ghostly pale with white hair and in a zombie-like state with no feeling.  Removing the nail from its cures all those who are affected, and kills the revenant.
* In the [[Girl Genius]] milieu, Hive Engines create Revenants by infecting normal people with Slaver Wasps.  They are then bound to obey any command given by The Other.  While stories say the Heterodyne Brothers are able to 'cure' the Revenant (by sucking the slaver wasp out of the person), it is commonly assumed that it is impossible to actually cure a Revenant.  There are several different types of Revenant, including one which acts perfectly normally until given a command.
* In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[American Gods]]'', Shadow Moon's wife, Laura, dies in a car accident then returns as a revenant after he places a magical coin in her grave. She protects her husband from harm by killing his abductors and hopes that he will find a way to bring her fully back to life.

===Revenants in film and television===
* The Tabanga, from the 1957 film ''[[From Hell It Came]]'', has characteristics of a revenant, but the word is never used.
* The 1973 Clint Eastwood Western ''[[High Plains Drifter]]'' involves a revenant; Eastwood plays the role of Marshal Jim Duncan, a man killed by the Carlin brothers in the town of Lago, Arizona, while investigating if the town was mining on government land. The plot consists of a "''Stranger''" riding into town on the day the Carlin brothers are due to be released from prison.  The Stranger offers to protect the town's inhabitants from the Carlin brothers.  As it happens, the townsfolk had hired the brothers to kill Marshal Duncan, then arrested the Carlins afterwards for a set-up gold robbery.  In exchange for his protection, the town agrees to provide anything The Stranger wants, in which he indulges. The next day, the gunslingers arrive and attack the town without resistance; The Stranger is nowhere to be found. After dark, The Stranger comes back into Lago and kills the gunslingers while parts of the town burn. The next day, as The Stranger leaves the partially ruined town, he stops by Boot Hill, where Mordicai, the only person he befriended—a dwarf he named as Sheriff and Mayor as part of his payment—is carving "James Duncan" on the Marshal's grave. He says to The Stranger that he doesn't know The Stranger's name, to which Eastwood replies, "Yes, you do," before heading out across the plains.
* While never referred to as such, in the later ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' films, [[Jason Voorhees]] fits the description of a revenant.
* Similarly, the ''[[Creepshow]]'' character Nathan Grantham, a miserly old man who returns from the grave to seek revenge on the relatives who murdered him, can best be described as a revenant, although he is not given any specific title in his undead state during the course of the story. Creepshow is inspired directly by the various EC Comics horror series, being a tribute to them.
* The character of Eric in [[James O'Barr]]'s ''[[The Crow]]'' is brought back from the dead to avenge his own murder, as well as the murder of his betrothed.
* In the animated series ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', Slade (known as [[Deathstroke]] in the [[Teen Titans|DC comic]]) is revived by the demon [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]] to be used as the harbinger of the coming apocalypse. Slade, however, diverges from his typically villainous path and uses this new-found life to become an [[antihero]] and help annihilate Trigon.
* In the 2011 reboot of ''Thundercats'', Pumyra is killed during the fall of Thundera and brought back as a Revenant by Mumm-Ra to serve as a spy and lover.
* EC-inspired revenant characters also appear in the 2007 horror film ''[[Trick r treat|Trick 'r Treat]]'' in the segment ''The School Bus Massacre Revisited''.  Though the undead children in the story appear to devour their victims like modern zombies, the retention of their personalities, urban legend surrounding their creation, and the displayed ability of one to speak directly to his killer mark them as revenants.
* ''[[They Came Back|Les Revenants]]'' (in the US '''They Came Back''', in the UK '''The Returned''') is a 2004 French zombie film about the reaction of the inhabitants of a French town after the spontaneous return of 70 million deceased people who, unlike typical zombies, present as cognitively conscious and healthy, having not suffered any biological damage.  The revenants, however, are not unlike children, having to relearn how to talk and remember.
* In Sheldon Wilson's 2004 indie sleeper hit ''Shallow Ground'' all the action in the film centers around a bloodsoaked revenant (portrayed by Rocky Marquette). This Bloody Boy is in fact an amalgamation of several murder victims of one crazed killer who was never caught.
* ''[[Les Revenants (TV series)|Les Revenants]]'' (international title '''The Returned''') is a French supernatural drama television series loosely adapted from the 2004 film of the same name, consisting of an initial season of eight episodes. It focuses on the return of four core characters—Camille, Simon, "Victor," and Serge—who attempt to resume their lives in a remote French city located near a lake. The series was renewed for a second season, which aired in the fall of 2015.
* In SyFy's ''[[Wynonna Earp (TV series)|Wynonna Earp]]'' the titular heroine fights revenants who were killed by her great-grandfather [[Wyatt Earp]]'s Colt Peacemaker.
* In the show ''Lost Girl'', Bo the unaligned succubus faces off against revenants. Also, Tamsin and Acacia have used them as soldiers for hire. It is said that the only way to gain dominion over a revenant or to find out who sent it is to drink its blood.

===Revenants in video games and gaming===

* The classic [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth|Doom II]]'' introduced a new enemy type called 'Revenant', which was portrayed as a large demonic skeleton, reanimated through the use of cybernetic armor, equipped with two shoulder cannons that fired both regular and homing rocket missiles.
* In the ''[[Warcraft]]'' universe, revenants are minor elemental creatures who once served as foot soldiers for the malefic Old Gods when the world was young.
* In the ''[[Dragon Age]]'' universe, revenants are particularly powerful undead. Like all ''Dragon Age'' undead, revenants are corpses that have been possessed by demons, in this case particularly powerful ones that use magic to bolster a melee oriented combat style. 
*In ''[[Dragon's Dogma]]'', the playable character is an Arisen. The Arisen is a person whose heart is taken by a dragon, and must go on a journey to battle the dragon to get it back. Arisen can only be killed in battle. Given the circumstances of becoming an Arisen, and tasked with a goal after "death," the Arisen may be considered a revenant.
* ''[[Hack/Slash]]'' is a popular horror comic that features Revenants. They are usually referred to as Slashers, and many of them are undead and monstrous beings who return from the grave, usually for revenge.
* In the ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' series, [[Raziel (Legacy of Kain)|Raziel]] served the purpose of a revenant. He was murdered by [[Kain (Legacy of Kain)|Kain]] in the prologue of ''[[Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver]]'', but was subsequently brought back by the [[List of Legacy of Kain characters#The Elder God|Elder God]] as a soul-devouring wraith to avenge himself, while simultaneously tasked to fulfill the designs of the God.
* ''[[Soul Calibur 3]]'' features a Revenant clad in a musketeer's outfit wielding two wave blades as a playable character. He is sometimes encountered in various characters' Tales of Souls mode.
* In ''[[Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness]]'', revenants can be found at night.
* After the events of ''[[Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare]]'', [[John Marston (Red Dead Redemption)|John Marston]] is dead, and in Escalera, Seth is shown stealing the ancient mask, causing the dead, including John, to return as undead. As John was buried with Holy Water, he returns as a revenant with a man's soul, allowing the player to still play as him.
* In the video game ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', revenants appear as a powerful deformed spirit found in the depths of cave systems.
* [[Commander Shepard]] (the protagonist of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' trilogy) has a signature weapon, the M-76 Revenant Light Machine Gun. The Revenant's name is also a symbolic reference to Shepard, a soldier brought back to life by Cerberus' ''Project Lazarus'' to protect humanity.
*In ''[[Counter-Strike Online]]'', Revenant appear as a boss that uses the fire skill in Zombie Scenario season 2. He can throw fireballs, dash, summon firestorms and heal.
* In the online game ''[[Ultima Online]]'', the revenant is a creature that can be summoned by a necromancer character to attack a specified target. It is also a creature that spawns occasionally in the dungeon Khaldun.
* In the [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]],'' the [[Revenant (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|revenant]] is a powerful [[undead]] creature strongly resembling a [[zombie]], a far less powerful undead creature, at first glance.
* [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]], from ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', qualified as a revenant. He returned from the dead prior to [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament]] to avenge his death at the hands of [[Noob Saibot|the elder Sub-Zero]], who would also become a revenant after Scorpion took his revenge.
* [[Caleb (computer game character)|Caleb]], the protagonist from the video game series ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]'' can also be considered a revenant.
* In the online game ''[[City of Heroes]],'' references are made in one story to 'The Revenant Hero Project'. This program inspired the enemies called Paragon Protectors, who exist within the villain group of Crey Industries. This project consisted of the harvesting of DNA from deceased heroes and the recording of their memories and personalities from life. A new body would be grown using the supplied genetic material and implanted with the memories of the past person, albeit with some minor adjustments to make that person subservient to Crey. This is the culmination of years of Crey research into cloning and [[memory implantation]]; they intended to keep the hero population in check by creating heroes of their own. They are in their own way bringing the dead back to life for the fulfillment of a task.
* In Cinematix Studios action roleplaying game [[Revenant (video game)|Revenant]], revenants are deceased individuals who have been transported, body and soul, back from the game world's version of Hell to serve the whims of the rich and powerful. These revenants function exactly like normal, healthy humans. The titular revenant is Locke D'Averam, is brought back from the dead by the wizard Sardok in order to save the island of Ahkulion from a mysterious cult, and to save the daughter of feudal lord Tendrick, whom the cultists had kidnapped.
* In the online game ''[[RuneScape]]'', revenants are the powerful undead spirits of warriors who died during the God Wars.
* In Yasuhiro Nightow's video game/anime series ''[[Gungrave (anime)|Gungrave]]'', the protagonist, Brandon Heat, is betrayed and murdered by his best friend, Harry McDowell. Heat returns as a revenant, re-animated through a complicated procedure called "necro-rise." The revenant's name is "Beyond The Grave," and while he is sentient, he seldom speaks as he embarks on a mission of vengeance against McDowell's Millenion Crime Syndicate. In the second installment of the video game franchise ([[Gungrave: Overdose]]), Jyuji Kabane is introduced as another revenant protagonist who joins forces with Heat. Jyuji was dead once, but re-animated by the Corisione crime family to be experimented on. After the experiments, Jyuji was injected with the series' apocalyptic drug, Seed, and left for dead. However, the blinded Jyuji uses a mysterious form of meditation to keep himself alive as he seeks revenge on The Corisiones.
* ''[[Guild Wars 2]]'' has a playable class called Revenant.
* Revenant appears in the digital card game [[Cabals: Magic &amp; Battle Cards]].
* In the indie RPG ''[[Undertale]]'', there is an undead character named Sans. Whilst referred to as simply a skeleton in-game, the character's actions and motivations, specifically in the game's "No Mercy" storyline, would qualify him as a revenant.
* The Nameless One, protagonist of Dungeons &amp; Dragons game [[Planescape: Torment]] could be considered a revenant. Each time he is killed, The Nameless One finds himself resurrected again, with scars and other major wounds carrying from one incarnation to the next. His intelligence, skills, and (eventually) memories remain intact as well.
* In guild wars two on the release of the first DLC one of the story's characters (Rytlock) turns into a revenant after jumping into the mist to reclaim his blade. With the release of this expansion, the player base is given one more class to play as. The Revenant. While playing as this class players will occasionally hear a disembodied voice talk to them depending on which heroic hero's soul they are attuned with.
* In ''[[Warframe]]'', Revenant is a playable character based on the in-game Sentient enemy class. Revenant has the ability to cause enemies to fight for him and his allies.

The '''Sarajevo Ramadan Festival''' ({{lang-bs|Sarajevo Ramazan Festival / Сарајево Рамазан Фестивал}}) is an annual religious and cultural [[festival]] held in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] that celebrates the [[Islamic]] holy month of [[Ramadan]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starigrad.ba/v2/vijest.php?id=4006|title=Na Žutoj tabiji otvoren prvi Sarajevo Ramazan Festival

The '''Signature Bridge''' is a [[Cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge|cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge]] which spans the [[Yamuna]] river at Wazirabad section, connecting [[Wazirabad, Delhi|Wazirabad]] to [[East Delhi]].&lt;ref name=NDTV&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/signature-bridge-to-be-ready-by-october-arvind-kejriwal-1878987|title= Signature Bridge To Be Ready By October: Arvind Kejriwal|date= 6 July 2018| accessdate=6 July 2018|publisher= www.ndtv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is India's first asymmetrical [[cable-stayed bridge]].&lt;ref name=NDTV/&gt; The [[Tower#Transportation support|pylon]] of the Signature bridge is the tallest structure in Delhi and is double the height of [[Qutb Minar]] with its 154-metre high viewing box, which acts as selfie points for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/154-metre-high-viewing-box-selfie-points-delhi-s-signature-bridge-opens-tomorrow/story-ss5rUlwFk5PI7Tkz2SV2AL.html|title=154-metre high viewing box, selfie points: Delhi’s Signature Bridge opens today}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shortens the travel time between north and northeast Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/as-signature-bridge-opens-rush-to-ease-on-ring-road-and-nh-9/articleshow/66493331.cms?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=TOIDesktop|title=As Delhi's Signature Bridge opens, rush to ease on Ring Road and National Highway-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Wazirabad bridge on sahibi river.jpg|thumb|left|The old wazirabad bridge]]
In 1997, 28 school students died in an accident on the narrow Wazirabad bridge.&lt;ref name= kolkata24x7/&gt; Since then, the Delhi government had plans to build another parallel wide bridge nearby to alleviate traffic congestions. By the end of 1998, the [[Government of Delhi|Delhi government]] finalised the draft plan for this bridge.&lt;ref name= kolkata24x7/&gt; The bridge was inaugurated on 4 November 2018 by the Chief Minister of Delhi [[Arvind Kejriwal]] with the aim to ease the burgeoning traffic congestion on the existing [[Wazirabad]] bridge.&lt;ref name= Y/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDTV_inaugration"&gt;{{cite news |title=Delhi's Signature Bridge To Have Selfie Spots, Glass Viewing Deck |url=https://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/delhi-signature-bridge-opens-to-public-on-monday-heres-what-it-offers-1942195 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |publisher=NDTV |date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By the end of 1998, the Delhi government finalized the draft plan made by Divyansh Sharma for the construction of the bridge. However, the construction of the bridge was stuck due to multiple reasons - lack of manpower and financial difficulties, being the major reason. When the project started, its cost was estimated to be ₹1,100&amp;nbsp;crore. Now it has surpassed  ₹1,875&amp;nbsp;crores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= More funds for Signature Bridge may help it meet latest dead|url= https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/more-funds-for-signature-bridge-may-help-it-meet-latest-deadline/articleshow/64890739.cms|date=  7 July 2018| accessdate= 7 July 2018 |publisher=Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theweekendleader&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theweekendleader.com/Headlines/13516/delhi-government-clears-signature-bridge-project.html|title=Delhi government clears signature bridge project |date= 6 July 2018| accessdate=7 July 2018|publisher=www.theweekendleader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Delhi|Delhi government]] was tight handed and it was very difficult for it to shell out the extra rising budget. ₹1,244&amp;nbsp;crores of rupees have been sanctioned recently through PBDB. The work had started in full swing in 2004 on the bridge. A fresh deadline of end 2016 was set in 2013.&lt;ref name=theweekendleader/&gt; Since then half a dozen times, deadlines have been missed and fresh deadlines set. Finally, the bridge was inaugurated in November 2018.&lt;ref name=kolkata24x7&gt;{{cite news|url=https://kolkata24x7.com/delhi-may-get-indias-first-asymmetrical-cable-stayed-bridge-by-october-will-decongest-wazirabad-bridge.html|title= নজির গড়ে দেশের বুকে তৈরি হচ্ছে প্রথম ‘অ্যাসমিট্রিক্যাল’ ব্রিজ|date= 6 July 2018| accessdate=6 July 2018|publisher= kolkata24x7.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The bridge is a [[Cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge]], a type of [[Cable-stayed bridge]] and in which cables were in a combination of radial and semi-harp arrangement, in which cables are spaced apart on the pylon, like the harp design, but connect to one point or a number of closely spaced points on the deck.&lt;ref name="Dayaratnam2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=T.K.

==Site description==

===Ownership===
TV Tropes was founded in 2004 by a programmer under the pseudonym "Fast Eddie", who described himself as having become interested in the conventions of [[genre fiction]] while studying at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in the 1970s and after browsing Internet forums in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://io9.com/5479423/behind-the-wiki-meet-tv-tropes-cofounder-fast-eddie |title=Behind The Wiki: Meet TV Tropes Cofounder Fast Eddie |publisher=[[io9]] |first=Annalee |last=Newitz |date=February 24, 2010 |accessdate=February 25, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227083524/https://io9.com/5479423/behind-the-wiki-meet-tv-tropes-cofounder-fast-eddie |archivedate=February 27, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018 the site is privately owned and the site publicly lists two co-owners besides Eddie.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/about.php |website=TV Tropes |accessdate=April 19, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421145813/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/about.php |archivedate=April 21, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
Initially focused on the television show ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'',&lt;ref name="MarySue"/&gt; TV Tropes has since increased its scope to include television series, [[film]]s, [[novel]]s, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[professional wrestling]], [[video game]]s, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[comic strip]]s/[[comic book|books]], [[fan fiction]], and many other subjects, including Internet works such as [[Wikipedia]] (referred to in-wiki as "The Other Wiki").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia |title=Wikipedia - Television Tropes &amp; Idioms |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025202729/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia |archivedate=October 25, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, articles on the site often relate to real life, or point out real situations where certain tropes can be applied. It has also used its informal style to describe topics such as science, philosophy, politics, and history under its Useful Notes section. TV Tropes does not have [[notability]] standards for the works it covers.&lt;ref name="Notability"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability |title=There Is No Such Thing As Notability - TV Tropes |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=May 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/696zkCvpC?url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability |archivedate=July 12, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article organization===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
The site includes entries on various series and tropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tropes|title=Tropes - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article on a work includes a brief summary of the work in question along with a list of associated tropes. Trope pages are the reverse of articles on works: they give a description of the trope itself, then provide a list of the trope's appearances in various works of media. In this way TV Tropes is fully interconnected through the various connections made between the works and their tropes.

For example, the trope "I Am Spartacus" is a specific type of scene that appears in multiple works. It refers to scenes where a character is shielded from identification by other characters who are also claiming to be that particular character. The trope name references a famous scene in the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=I Am Spartacus |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus |website=TV Tropes |accessdate=September 7, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907080917/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus |archivedate=September 7, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example is included, along with examples from ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'', the [[Talmud]] and even recent stories from real life. Not all examples of a trope may be cases where it is "played straight". They may also include cases where the trope is parodied, played with, inverted or even averted (i.e. avoided altogether in a context where it would be expected).

In addition to the tropes, most articles about a work also have a "Your Mileage May Vary"&lt;ref name="mileage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/HomePage |title=Your Mileage May Vary - Television Tropes &amp; Idioms |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=August 21, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903082355/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/HoMepage |archivedate=September 3, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (YMMV) page with items that are deemed to be subjective. These items are not usually storytelling tropes, but are audience reactions which have been defined and titled. For example, the page of the well known trope "[[jumping the shark]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark|title=Jumping the Shark - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the moment at which a series experiences a sharp decline in quality as in the notorious story point in ''[[Happy Days]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays|title=Happy Days (Series) - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; only contains a list of works that reference the phrase. TV Tropes does not apply the term to a show, that being a subjective opinion about the show, but cites uses of the phrase by the show ("in-universe"). Most articles also have various pages within them. For example, the article may have an "Awesome"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/sugarwiki/momentofawesome?from=main.crowningmomentofawesome|title=Moment of Awesome / Sugar Wiki - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; page to describe crowning moments of awesome (i.e., a moment in a show or other fictional work that the majority of the readers or viewers regard as one of the high points); a "Fridge" page which describes examples of the tropes "Fridge Logic"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic|title=Fridge Logic - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (issues of a given work's internal consistency that do not typically occur to one until later), as well as the related "Fridge Horror"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror|title=Fridge Horror - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Fridge Brilliance";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance|title=Fridge Brilliance - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "Laconic"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaconicWiki|title=Laconic Wiki - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; page which describes an article/trope in a few short words; and more pages that focus on a particular aspect of an article/item.

===Trope descriptions===
Trope description pages are generally created through a standardized launching system, known as the "Trope Launch Pad" (TLP, formerly "You Know That Thing Where" [YKTTW]); site members, (referred to as "Tropers"), can draft a trope description and have the option of providing examples or suggesting refinements to other drafts before launch. While going through TLP is not necessary to launch a trope, it is strongly recommended in order to strengthen the trope as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TLPGuidelines |title=TLP Guidelines |accessdate=October 2, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003124445/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TLPGuidelines |archivedate=October 3, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has created its own self-referencing meta-trope, known as "TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life". The trope warns that some readers may become jaded and cynical as an unanticipated side effect of reading TV Tropes, "[replacing] surprise almost entirely with recognition,"  referring to the inability to read books, watch films, etc. without identifying each trope as it occurs. Also mentioned is that many frequently-contributing community members self-describe themselves as addicted to the site. The community has dubbed the pattern of many tropers as taking a "Wiki Walk," starting an edit on an intended article, and subsequently following links from one page to the next for hours on end without intending to, pausing occasionally to add examples the troper notices to the listings or rework articles. In the process, this leads to the discovery of entirely new tropes to analyze, edit, and add examples to. This self-perpetuating cycle of behavior has become the subject of much lampooning for the community, with tongue-in-cheek references being made in the articles for tropes such as "[[Brainwashing]]," "Hive Mind," and ''Tome of Eldritch Lore'' (a book of cursed knowledge which infects the reader with obsessive madness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife |title=TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/696zkhf0z?url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife |archivedate=July 12, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanding scope===
Considerable redesign of some aspects of content organization occurred in 2008, such as the introduction of [[namespace]]s, while 2009 saw the arrival of other languages, [[German language|German]] being the most developed. In 2011, TV Tropes branched out into video production, and launched ''Echo Chamber'', a web series about a TV Tropes [[vlog]]ger explaining and demonstrating tropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EchoChamber |title=Echo Chamber |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901055445/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EchoChamber |archivedate=September 1, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In an interview with TV Tropes co-founder Fast Eddie, [[Gawker Media]]'s blog ''[[io9]]'' described the tone of contributions to the site as "often light and funny". [[Cyberpunk]] author [[Bruce Sterling]] once described its style as a "wry [[fan fiction|fanfic]] analysis".&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;{{cite web |author=Bruce Sterling |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/01/tv-tropes-the-a |title=TV Tropes, the all-devouring pop-culture wiki |publisher=WIRED |date=January 21, 2009 |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312063723/https://www.wired.com/2009/01/tv-tropes-the-a |archivedate=March 12, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essayist Linda Börzsei described TV Tropes as a technological continuum of classical archetypal literary criticisms, capable of deconstructing [[Trope (literature)|recurring elements]] from creative works in an ironic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Börzsei |first=Linda |title=Literary Criticism in New Media |website=Academia.edu |date=April 2012 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4570620/Literary_Criticism_in_New_Media_A_critical_analysis_of_the_website_Television_Tropes_and_Idioms_and_the_place_of_literature_in_digital_culture |accessdate=September 3, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711171506/https://www.academia.edu/4570620/Literary_Criticism_in_New_Media_A_critical_analysis_of_the_website_Television_Tropes_and_Idioms_and_the_place_of_literature_in_digital_culture |archivedate=July 11, 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Robin Hanson]], inspired by a scholarly analysis of Victorian literature,&lt;ref name=epjournal&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep06715738.pdf |format=PDF |author=Kruger, Daniel et. al. |year=2006 |title=Hierarchy in the Library: Egalitarian Dynamics in Victorian Novels |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Psychology |accessdate=November 1, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023074308/https://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep06715738.pdf |archivedate=October 23, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests TV Tropes offers a veritable treasure trove of information about fiction - a prime opportunity for research into its nature.&lt;ref name=overcomingbias&gt;{{cite web |last=Hanson |first=Robin |url=https://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/05/tropes-are-treasures.html |title=Tropes Are Treasures |publisher=Overcoming Bias |date=May 9, 2009 |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020232952/https://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/05/tropes-are-treasures.html |archivedate=October 20, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lifehacker]], Nick Douglas compared TV Tropes to [[Wikipedia]], recommending to "use [TV Tropes] when Wikipedia feels impenetrable, when you want opinions more than facts, or when you've finished a Wikipedia page and now you want the juicy parts, the hard-to-confirm bits that Wikipedia doesn't share."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Douglas |first=Nick |url=https://lifehacker.com/use-the-tv-tropes-site-the-same-way-you-would-wikipedia-1822930619 |title=Use the TV Tropes Site the Same Way You Would Wikipedia |work=Lifehacker |date=February 12, 2018 |accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Mature content incident===
In October 2010, in what the site refers to as "The Google Incident", [[Google]] temporarily withdrew its [[AdSense]] service from the site after determining that pages regarding adult and mature tropes were inconsistent with its terms of service.&lt;ref name="GoogIn"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TheGoogleIncident |title=Administrivia: The Google Incident |publisher=TV Tropes |accessdate=May 16, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516034226/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TheGoogleIncident |archivedate=May 16, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!category-topic/adsense/i-dont-yet-have-an-account-getting-approved/T7-CeRf60B0 |title=Google Groups |website=productforums.google.com|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a separate incident in 2012, in response to other complaints by Google, TV Tropes changed its guidelines to restrict coverage of sexist tropes and [[rape]] tropes. Feminist blog ''The Mary Sue'' criticized this decision, as it censored documentation of sexist tropes in [[sexism in video games|video games]] and [[young adult fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.themarysue.com/tv-tropes-rape-articles/ |title=TV Tropes Deletes Every Rape Trope; Geek Feminism Wiki steps in |publisher=themarysue.com |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=May 16, 2014 |author=Aja Romano |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423223946/https://www.themarysue.com/tv-tropes-rape-articles/ |archivedate=April 23, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[ThinkProgress]]'' additionally condemned Google AdSense itself for "providing a financial disincentive to discuss" such topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/06/26/506563/tv-tropes/ |title=TV Tropes Bows to Google’s Ad Servers, Deletes Discussions of Sexual Assault in Culture |publisher=[[ThinkProgress]] |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=May 16, 2014 |author=Alyssa Rosenberg |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517121952/https://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/06/26/506563/tv-tropes/ |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site now separates NSFG articles (Not Safe for Google) from SFG articles (Safe for Google) in order to allow discussion of these kinds of tropes.&lt;ref name="GoogIn"/&gt;

Regarding these and other concerns of re-licensing and advertising, a wiki called All The Tropes [[Fork (software development)|fork]]ed all the content from TV Tropes with the original CC-BY-SA license in late 2013.

==Origin of phrase==
The term "teach the controversy" originated with [[Gerald Graff]], a professor of English and education at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]],&lt;ref name = Graff&gt;[http://insidehighered.com/views/2005/09/28/graff "To Debate or Not to Debate Intelligent Design?"] by Gerald Graff, Inside Higher Ed, September 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; as an admonition to teach that established knowledge is not simply given as a settled matter, but that it is created in a crucible of debate and controversy. To the chagrin of Graff, who describes himself as a liberal secularist,&lt;ref name = Graff /&gt; the idea was later appropriated by [[Phillip E. Johnson]], Discovery Institute program advisor and father of the ID movement. Discussing the 1999-2000 Kansas State Board of Education controversy over the teaching of intelligent design in public school classrooms, Johnson wrote "What educators in Kansas and elsewhere should be doing is to 'teach the controversy'." In his book Johnson proposed casting the conflicting points of view and agendas as a scholarly controversy. Johnson's usage differs somewhat from Graff's original concept. While Graff advocated that a comprehensive understanding of what are considered to be "established" concepts must include teaching the debates and conflicts by which they were established, Johnson appropriated the phrase to cast doubt upon the very concept of established knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/evolution.html?pg=2 The Crusade Against Evolution], Evan Ratliff, October 2004, ''Wired'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was picked up by other Discovery Institute affiliates [[Stephen C. Meyer]], David K. DeWolf, and Mark E. DeForrest in their 1999 article, "Teaching the Controversy: Darwinism, Design and the Public School Science Curriculum"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Scholarship%20-%20Law%20and%20Policy&amp;id=58 Teaching the Controversy: Darwinism, Design and the Public School Science Curriculum] David K. DeWolf, Stephen C. Meyer, Mark E. DeForrest. Foundation for Thought and Ethics, October 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]]. The Foundation for Thought and Ethics also publishes the controversial pro-intelligent design biology textbook ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', suggested as an alternative to mainstream science and biology textbooks in the Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plans proposed by Teach the Controversy proponents.

==Development of the strategy==
The roots of the intelligent design movement's strategy are found in the past attempts of creationists to force religious views into public school science classes. The most recent of these had been [[creation science]], which sought to provide a scientific veneer for the biblical account of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. The characteristics of the intelligent design movement are a direct response to the tactical and legal failings of earlier creationist movements. Design proponents' strategies represent a natural evolution of the "creation science" movement, proceeding still further in the direction of claiming the mantle of science while denying their religious intentions in argument.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Comparisons of the drafts of the intelligent design textbook ''Of Pandas and People'' before and after the 1987 ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' ruling showed that the definition given in the book for creation science in pre Edwards drafts is identical to the definition of intelligent design in post Edwards drafts; cognates of the word creation—creationism and creationist, which appeared approximately 150 times were deliberately and systematically replaced with the phrase 'intelligent design'; and the changes occurred shortly after the Supreme Court ruled in ''Edwards'' that creation science is religious and cannot be taught in public school science classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 2: context#Page 32 of 139|Ruling - context, pg. 32]] ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was devised by Stephen C. Meyer and Discovery Institute founder and President Bruce Chapman as a compromise strategy in March 2002. They had come to the realisation that the dispute over intelligent design's (lack of) scientific standing was complicating their efforts to have evolution challenged in the science classroom. This strategy was designed to move the focus onto an approach that stresses open debate and evolution's purported weakness, but does not require students to study intelligent design. The intention was to create doubt over evolution and avoid the question of whether the [[intelligent designer]] was [[God]], while giving the institute time to strengthen their purported theory of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html?referrer=email Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens] Peter Slevin. Washington Post, March 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of this strategy was to allay teacher fears of legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest and Gross(2004) p206&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment of the strategy==
The Discovery Institute's strategy has been for the institute itself or groups acting on its behalf to lobby state and local boards of education, and local, state and federal policymakers to enact policies and/or laws, often in the form of textbook disclaimers and the language of state science standards, that undermine or remove evolutionary theory from the public school science classroom by portraying it as "controversial" and "in crisis;" a portrayal that stands in contrast to the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community that there is no controversy, that evolution is one of the best-supported theories in all of science, and that whatever controversy does exist is political and religious, not scientific.&lt;ref name="nap"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/teach-controversy.html Turn out the lights, the "Teach the controversy" party’s over]&lt;/ref&gt; The Teach the Controversy strategy has benefitted from 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with intelligent design proponents&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/dfiles/file_161.pdf Creationism in 2001: A State-by-State Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615102746/http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/dfiles/file_161.pdf |date=2006-06-15 }} [[People For the American Way]]. (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; as alluded to in the Discovery Institute's [[Wedge Strategy]].

As the primary organizer and promoter of the Teach the Controversy campaign, the Discovery Institute has played a central role in nearly all intelligent design cases, often working behind the scenes to orchestrate, underwrite and support local campaigns and intelligent design groups such as the Intelligent Design Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intelligentdesignnetwork.org/ Intelligent Design Network.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It has provided support ranging from material assistance to federal, state and regionally elected representatives in the drafting of bills to the provision of support and advice to individual parents confronting their school boards. DI's goal is to move from battles over standards to curriculum writing and textbook adoption while undermining the central positions of evolution in biology and [[methodological naturalism]] in science. In order to make their proposals more palatable, the Institute and its supporters claim to advocate presenting evidence both for and against evolution, thus encouraging students to evaluate the evidence.

Though Teach the Controversy is presented by its proponents as encouraging [[academic freedom]], it, along with the [[Santorum Amendment]], is viewed by many academics as a threat to academic freedom&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bemidjistate.edu/dsiems/ID/teach.html Intelligent Design: Teach the Controversy?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910141925/http://www.bemidjistate.edu/dsiems/ID/teach.html |date=2006-09-10 }} Dann P. Siems, Assistant Professor Biology &amp; Integrative Studies, [[Bemidji State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is rejected by the [[National Science Teachers Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nsta.org/positionstatement%26psid%3D10 |title=NSTA Position Statement: The Teaching of Evolution |access-date=2018-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030419072737/http://www.nsta.org/positionstatement%26psid%3D10 |archive-date=2003-04-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.&lt;ref name="AAAS" /&gt; The American Society for Clinical Investigation's ''Journal of Clinical Investigation'' describes the Teach the Controversy strategy and campaign as a "[[hoax]]" and that "the [[manufactured controversy|controversy is manufactured]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/116/5/1134 Defending science education against intelligent design: a call to action] American Society for Clinical Investigation, Journal of Clinical Investigation. 116:1134-1138 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the objection that there is no scientific controversy to teach, another common objection is that the Teach the Controversy campaign and intelligent design arise out of a [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] and [[evangelism|evangelistic]] movement that calls for broad social, academic and political changes.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context|Context]] Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District. Pages 17-35&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligent design proponents argue their concepts and motives should be given independent consideration. Those critical of intelligent design see the two as intertwined and inseparable, citing the foundational documents of the movement such as the ''Wedge Document'' and statements made by intelligent design proponents to their constituents. The judge in the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial considered testimony and evidence from both sides on the question of the motives of intelligent design proponents when he ruled that "ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents"&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|Ruling]], Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, Case No. 04cv2688. December 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and "that ID is an interesting theological argument, but that it is not science."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 89 of 139|Ruling, Whether ID Is Science]], Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, Case No. 04cv2688. December 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the debate surrounding the linking of the motives of intelligent design proponents to their arguments, following the [[Kansas evolution hearings]] the chairman of the Kansas school board, Steve Abrams, cited in The New York Times as saying that though he's a creationist who believes that God created the universe 6,500 years ago, he is able to keep the two separate:
{{quotation|In my personal faith, yes, I am a creationist, ... But that doesn't have anything to do with science. I can separate them. ... my personal views of Scripture have no room in the science classroom.&lt;ref name="nyt_kansas"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/us/01evolution.html?ei=5088&amp;en=da489440c39ebbb4&amp;ex=1312084800&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all Evolution’s Backers in Kansas Start Counterattack] Ralph Blumenthal. The New York Times, August 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Afterward, [[Lawrence Krauss]], a Case Western Reserve University physicist and astronomer, in a New York Times essay said: {{quotation|A key concern should not be whether Dr. Abrams's religious views have a place in the classroom, but rather how someone whose religious views require a denial of essentially all modern scientific knowledge can be chairman of a state school board. ... As we work to improve the abysmal state of science education in our public schools, we will continue to do battle with those who feel that knowledge is a threat to religious faith ... we should remember that the battle is not against faith, but against ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/15/science/sciencespecial2/15essa.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin How to Make Sure Children Are Scientifically Illiterate] Lawrence M. Krauss. The New York Times, August 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A rudimentary form of the teach the controversy strategy had emerged first among creationists following the Supreme Court's ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' decision. The [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) prepared an evaluation of what the movement should try next, suggesting "school boards and teachers should be strongly encouraged at least to stress the scientific evidences and arguments against evolution in their classes . . . even if they don't wish to recognize these as evidences and arguments for creationism." [[Glenn Branch]] of the [[National Center for Science Education]] says this comment shows that the teach the controversy strategy was "pioneered in the wake of Edwards v. Aguillard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.waronscience.com/excerpt.php?p=2|title=The Republican War on Science|author=Chris Mooney|publisher=Basic Books|date=August 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the September 2005 start of the ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' trial, the "Dover trial," prominent intelligent design proponents gradually shifted to a "Teach the Controversy" strategy. They had realised that mandates requiring the teaching of intelligent design were unlikely to survive challenges based on the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and that an unfavorable ruling had the effect of legally ruling intelligent design a form of religious creationism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Thus, the Discovery Institute repositioned itself. It publicly abandoned advocating for any policies or laws that required the teaching of intelligent design in favor of a Teach the Controversy strategy.&lt;ref&gt;"In a country in which more than 50 percent of adults consistently tell pollsters that they believe God created humans in their present form within the past 10,000 years, however, there will undoubtedly be a fourth wave that will feature yet another strategy to promote creationism by questioning evolution. It looks as if this next wave will jettison the creationist and intelligent-design baggage and concentrate exclusively on a "teach the controversy" strategy." [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/21/2277 Intelligent Judging — Evolution in the Classroom and the Courtroom] George J. Annas, New England Journal of Medicine, Volume 354:2277-2281 May 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Institute Fellows reasoned that once the "fact" that a controversy indeed exists had been established in the public's mind, then the reintroduction of intelligent design into public school criteria would be much less controversial later.&lt;ref name=show_me&gt;[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dennett05/dennett05_index.html Show Me The Science] Daniel C. Dennett. New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best illustration of this shift in strategy is comparing the Discovery Institute's 1999 guidebook ''Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula'' which concludes "school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution"&lt;ref name=guidebook&gt;[http://arn.org/docs/dewolf/guidebook.htm Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula: A Legal Guidebook] David K. DeWolf, Stephen C. Meyer, Mark E. DeForrest 1999, Foundation for Thought and Ethics.&lt;/ref&gt; to 2006 statements by Phillip E. Johnson, that his intent was never to use public school education as the forum for his ideas and that he hoped to ignite and perpetuate a debate in universities and among the higher echelon of scientific thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/education/story/14254103p-15069795c.html Father of intelligent design]{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Kim Minugh, Sacramento Bee, May 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

With the December 2005 ruling in ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', wherein Judge John E. Jones III concluded that intelligent design is not science, intelligent design proponents were left with the Teach the Controversy strategy as the most likely method left to realize the goals stated in the [[Wedge strategy|wedge document]]. Thus, the Teach the Controversy strategy has become the primary thrust of the Discovery Institute in promoting its aims. Just as intelligent design is a [[stalking horse]] for the campaign against what its proponents claim is a materialist foundation in science that precludes God, Teach the Controversy has become a stalking horse for intelligent design. But the ''Dover'' ruling also characterized "teaching the controversy" as part of a religious ploy.&lt;ref name="Establishment Clause Page 134"/&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2011}}

==Shift to the "Critical Analysis of Evolution"==
{{See also|Critical Analysis of Evolution}}
By May 2006{{Chronology citation needed|date=June 2011}} the Discovery Institute sought to replace the failed "teach the controversy" strategy with a strategy broadened to include examples of other supposedly legitimate scientific controversies. In Ohio and Michigan where school boards were again reviewing science curricula standards the Discovery Institute and its allies proposed lesson plans that included [[global warming]], [[cloning]] and [[stem cell research]] as further examples of controversies that are akin to the alleged scientific controversy over evolution. All four topics are widely accepted by the majority of the scientific community as legitimate science, and all four are areas where US political conservatives have been known to be critical of the [[scientific consensus]]. Members of the scientific community have responded to this tactic by pointing out that like evolution whatever controversy may exist over cloning and stem cell research has been largely social and political, while dissident viewpoints over global warming are often viewed as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=hoppe&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/ohio_here_we_go_1.html Ohio: Here We Go Again] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180810/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/ohio_here_we_go_1.html |date=2007-09-30 }} Richard B.

Dispatches from the Culture Wars, June 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Richard B. Hoppe, holder of a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Minnesota, described the tactic in the following way:
{{quotation|Like the attacks on evolution, the attack on climate science is driven by the sectarian conviction that 'materialistic' science is untrustworthy and must be replaced. As with intelligent design creationism, science-deniers' so-called evidence takes the form of claims for the insufficiency of current scientific explanations rather than concrete, testable alternative hypotheses. As in the evolution debate, religious extremists use the clever strategy of denigrating the scientific consensus on causality (global warming is human-caused via pollution) by pretending it contrasts sharply with an alternative scientific theory that, properly-understood, is really just a more nuanced view that's not really in opposition (current global warming is part of the earth’s natural cycle but is being exacerbated by pollution). This exaggerates the intensity of normal scientific debate in order to suggest there's something wrong with climate science, and then uses this manufactured controversy to cloak the anti-science view and smuggle it into classrooms — sectarian religious evangelism masquerading as science.&lt;ref name=hoppe/&gt;}}

Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 89 of 139|p89]]&lt;/ref&gt; intelligent design proponents have moved to a fallback position, emphasizing contrived flaws in evolution and overemphasizing remaining questions in the theory what they call the ''Critical Analysis of Evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligentdesign.podomatic.com/entry/2006-07-11T09_38_44-07_00 Critical Analysis of Evolution is Not the Same as Teaching Intelligent Design] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828121119/http://intelligentdesign.podomatic.com/entry/2006-07-11T09_38_44-07_00 |date=2006-08-28 }} Casey Luskin.

The Panda's Thumb, July 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Critical Analysis of Evolution]]'' continues the themes of the teach the controversy strategy, emphasizing what they say are the "criticisms" of evolutionary theory and "arguments against evolution," which continues to be portrayed as "a theory in crisis." Early drafts of the Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan referred to the lesson as the "great evolution debate"; one of the early drafts of the lesson plan had one section titled "Conducting the Macroevolution Debate". In a subsequent draft, it was changed to "Conducting the Critical Analysis Activity". The wording for the two sections is nearly identical, with just "debate" changed to "critical analysis activity" wherever it appeared, in the manner of how intelligent design proponents simply replaced "creation" with "intelligent design" in ''Of Pandas and People'' to repackage a creation science textbook into an intelligent design textbook.

==Repercussions==
The campaigns of intelligent design proponents seeking curricular challenges have been disruptive, divisive and expensive for the affected communities. In pursuing the goal of establishing intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science classes, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/Day2PMSession.pdf Testimony, Aralene Callahan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201142541/http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/Day2PMSession.pdf |date=2007-12-01 }} Kitzmiller v.

For example, as a result of the Dover trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of ''teaching the controversy''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130105132526/http://www.yorkdispatch.com/searchresults/ci_3535139 Dover gets a million-dollar bill] Christina Kauffman.

Four days after the six-week ''Dover'' trial concluded, all eight of the Dover school board members who were up for reelection were voted out of office. [[Televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]] in turn told the citizens of Dover, "If there is a disaster in your area, don't turn to God. You just rejected him from your city." Robertson said if they have future problems in Dover, "I recommend they call on Charles Darwin. Maybe he can help them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/10/politics/main1036232.shtml Robertson: PA Voters Rejected God] CBS News, November 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics, like [[Wesley R. Elsberry]], say the Discovery Institute has cynically manufactured much of the political and religious controversy to further its agenda, pointing to statements of prominent proponents like Johnson:
{{quotation|Whether educational authorities allow the schools to teach about the controversy or not, public recognition that there is something seriously wrong with Darwinian orthodoxy is going to keep on growing. While the educators stonewall, our job is to continue building the community of people who understand the difference between a science that tests its theories against the evidence, and a pseudoscience that protects its key doctrines by imposing philosophical rules and erecting legal barriers to freedom of thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arn.org/docs/pjweekly/pj_weekly_010611.htm The Pennsylvania Controversy] Phillip E. Johnson, Phillip Johnson's Weekly Wedge Update. June 11, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To the absence of actual scientific controversy over the validity of evolutionary theory, Johnson said:

Johnson, Phillip Johnson's Weekly Wedge Update. May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And to the resistance of science educators over portraying evolution as controversial or disputed, Johnson said:
{{quotation|If the public school educators will not "teach the controversy," our informal network can do the job for them.

April 9, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Elsberry and others allege that statements like Johnson's are proof that the alleged scientific controversy intelligent design proponents seek to have taught is a product of the institute's members and staff. In the ''Dover'' trial's ruling the judge wrote that intelligent design proponents had misrepresented the scientific status of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;"ID proponents support their assertion that evolutionary theory cannot account for life’s complexity by pointing to real gaps in scientific knowledge, which indisputably exist in all scientific theories, but also by misrepresenting well-established scientific propositions."

According to published reports, the nonprofit Discovery Institute received grants and gifts totaling $4.1 million for 2003 from 22 foundations. Of these, two-thirds had primarily religious missions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050911/OPINION02/509110732/1087/opinion Intelligent design group is just a religious front] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627201715/http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050911%2FOPINION02%2F509110732%2F1087%2Fopinion |date=2006-06-27 }} by Fred Barton, Lansing State Journal.

==Political action==
The Discovery Institute aggressively promotes its Teach the Controversy campaign and intelligent design to the public, education officials and public policymakers. Its efforts are largely aimed at conservative Christian policymakers, where it is cast as a counterbalance to the liberal influences of "atheistic scientists" and "Dogmatic Darwinists." As a measure of their success in this effort, on 1 August 2005, during a round-table interview with reporters from five Texas newspapers, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] said that he believes schools should discuss intelligent design alongside evolution when teaching students about the origin of life. Bush, a conservative Christian, declined to go into detail on his personal views of the origin of life, but advocated the ''Teach the Controversy'' approach - "I think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought... you're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas, the answer is yes." Christian conservatives, a substantial part of Bush's voting base, have been central in promoting the Teach the Controversy campaign.

In some state battles, the ties of Teach the Controversy and intelligent design proponents to the Discovery Institute's political and social activities have been made public resulting in their efforts being temporarily thwarted. The Discovery Institute takes the view that all publicity is good and that no defeat is real. The Institute has shown a willingness to back off, even to not advocate for the inclusion of ID, to ensure that all science teachers are required to portray evolution as a "theory in crisis." The Institute's strategy is to move, relentlessly, from standards battles, to curriculum writing, to textbook adoption, and back again doing whatever it takes to undermine the central position of evolution in biology. Critics of this strategy and the movement contend that the intelligent design controversy diverts much time, effort and tax money away from the actual education of children.

===Political battles involving the Discovery Institute===
{{Off topic|date=June 2011}}&lt;!-- This section involves little that is of direct relevance to TtC specifically, as opposed to various other ID-related articles --&gt;
{{Main article|Intelligent design in politics}}
*'''2000 Congressional briefing''': In 2000, the leading ID proponents operating through the Discovery Institute held a congressional briefing in [[Washington, D.C.]], to promote ID to lawmakers. Sen. [[Rick Santorum]] was and continues to be one of ID's most vocal supporters. One result of this briefing was that Sen. Santorum inserted pro-ID language into the No Child Left Behind bill calling for students to be taught why evolution "generates so much continuing controversy," an assertion heavily promoted by the Discovery Institute.
*'''2001 Santorum Amendment''': As a result of the 2000 Congressional briefing, the Discovery Institute drafted and lobbied for the Santorum Amendment to the [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]] education act. The amendment encouraged the "teach the controversy" approach to evolution education. The amendment was passed by the U.S. Senate, but was left out of the final version of the Act, and remains only in highly modified form in the conference report, where it does not carry the weight of law. The conference report language is commonly touted by the Discovery Institute as model language for bills and curricula. The Discovery Institute lobbies states, counties, and municipalities, and offers them legal analysis and Institute-developed curricula and text books they proclaim meet constitutional criteria established by the courts in previous creationism/evolution First Amendment cases.
*'''2002-2006 Ohio Board of Education''': The Discovery Institute proposed a model lesson plan that featured intelligent design prominently in its curricula. It was adopted in part in October 2002, with the Board's advising that the science standards do "not mandate the teaching or testing of intelligent design." This was touted by the Discovery Institute as a significant victory. By February 2006 the Ohio Board of Education voted 11-4 to delete the science standard and correlating lesson plan adopted in 2002. [http://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/02/15/evolution.debate.ap/index.html] The board also rejected a competing plan from the institute to request a legal opinion from the state attorney general on the constitutionality of the science standards. Intelligent design proponents pledged to force another vote on the issue.
*'''2005 [[Kansas evolution hearings]]''': A series of hearings instigated by the institute held in Topeka, Kansas May 2005 by the Kansas State Board of Education to review changes how the origin of life would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. The hearings were boycotted by the [[scientific community]], and views expressed represented largely those of intelligent design advocates. The result of the hearings was the adoption of new science standards by the Republican-dominated board in defiance of the State Board Science Hearing Committee that relied upon the institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan and adopted the institute's Teach the Controversy approach. In August 2006 conservative Republicans lost their majority on the board in a primary election. The moderate Republican and Democrats gaining seats vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board.
*'''2005 [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]''': Eleven parents of students in the [[school district]] of [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], sued the [[Dover Area School District]] over a statement that the school board required to be read aloud in ninth-grade science classes when evolution was taught endorsing intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. In December, 2005 United States federal court judge John E. Jones III [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|ruled that]] intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature.

==Criticism==
The theory of evolution is accepted by the vast majority of biologists and by the scientific community in general, in such overwhelming numbers that the theory of evolution is viewed as having scientific [[consensus]]. Over 70 scientific societies, institutions, and other professional groups representing tens of thousands individual scientists have issued policy statements supporting evolution education and opposing intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of scientific societies rejecting intelligent design]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 83 of 139|Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover]] page 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific controversies are minor and concern the details of the mechanisms of evolution, not the validity of the overarching theory of evolution. In the absence of an actual professional controversy between groups of experts on evolution, critics say intelligent design proponents have merely renamed the conflict that already existed between biologists and creationists, and that the controversy to which intelligent design proponents refer is political in nature and thus, by definition, outside of the realm of science and scientific educational curricula. Critics contend that intelligent design proponents ignore this point by continuing to make the claim of a "scientific controversy." According to Thomas Dixon, "The 'controversy' in question has not arisen from any substantial scientific disagreement but is the product of a concerted public relations exercise aimed at the Christian parents of America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| page = 102| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the National Association of Biology Teachers, in a statement endorsing evolution as noncontroversial, quoted [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]]: "[[Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution]]" and went on to state that the quote "accurately reflects the central, unifying role of evolution in biology. The theory of evolution provides a framework that explains both the history of life and the ongoing adaptation of organisms to environmental challenges and changes." They emphasized that "Scientists have firmly established evolution as an important natural process" and that "The selection of topics covered in a biology curriculum should accurately reflect the principles of biological science. Teaching biology in an effective and scientifically honest manner requires that evolution be taught in a standards-based instructional framework with effective classroom discussions and laboratory experiences."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabt.org/sub/position_statements/evolution.asp Statement on Teaching Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927160040/http://www.nabt.org/sub/position_statements/evolution.asp |date=2006-09-27 }} National Association of Biology Teachers, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent evolutionary biologists such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Jerry Coyne]] have proposed various "controversies" that are worth teaching, instead of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/life/feature/story/0,13026,1559743,00.html One side can be wrong] The Guardian. September 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins compares teaching intelligent design in schools to teaching [[Flat Earth|flat earthism]]: perfectly fine in a history class but not in science. "If you give the idea that there are two schools of thought within science, one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat, you are misleading children."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1090909,00.html The Evolution Wars] Claudia Wallis. TIME magazine. August 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Time Magazine, 15 August 2005, page 32--&gt; [[Tufts University]] Professor of Philosophy [[Daniel C. Dennett]], author of ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', describes how they generate a sense of controversy: "The proponents of intelligent design use an ingenious ploy that works something like this: First you misuse or misdescribe some scientist's work. Then you get an angry rebuttal. Then, instead of dealing forthrightly with the charges leveled, you cite the rebuttal as evidence that there is a 'controversy' to teach."&lt;ref name=show_me/&gt;

Critics of the Teach the Controversy movement and strategy can also be found outside of the scientific community. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], described the approach of the movement's proponents as "a disarming subterfuge designed to undermine solid evidence that all living things share a common ancestry." "The movement is a veneer over a certain theological message. Every one of these groups is now actively engaged in trying to undercut sound science education by criticizing evolution," said Lynn. "It is all based on their religious ideology. Even the people who don't specifically mention religion are hard-pressed with a straight face to say who the intelligent designer is if it's not God."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens] Peter Slevin.

Real Time with Bill Maher, HBO, August 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Discovery Institute===
According to critics of the Discovery Institute's efforts through the Teach the Controversy campaign and the intelligent design movement, the Wedge strategy betrays the Institute's political rather than scientific and educational purpose. The Discovery Institute and its [[Center for Science and Culture]] (CSC) has an overarching conservative Christian social and political agenda that seeks to redefine both law and science and how they are conducted, with the stated goal of a religious "renewal" of American culture.

Critics also allege that the Discovery Institute has a long-standing record of misrepresenting research, law and its own policy and agenda and that of others:

*The Discovery Institute, following the policies outlined by Phillip E. Johnson, obfuscates its agenda. Opposed to the public statements to the contrary made by the Discovery Institute, Johnson has admitted that the goal of intelligent design movement is to cast creationism as a scientific concept:

Phrase the argument in such a way that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, "Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?" and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touchstonemag.com/docs/issues/15.5docs/15-5pg40.html Berkeley’s Radical An Interview with Phillip E.

Johnson}}
*[[Rob Boston]] of the Americans United for Separation of Church and State described Johnson's vision of the Wedge as: "The objective [of the Wedge Strategy] is to convince people that Darwinism is inherently atheistic, thus shifting the debate from creationism vs. evolution to the existence of God vs. the non-existence of God. From there people are introduced to 'the truth' of the Bible and then 'the question of sin' and finally 'introduced to Jesus.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010508032051/http://www.au.org/churchstate/cs4995.htm ''Missionary Man''], Rob Boston, ''Church &amp; State'', April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
* Instead of producing original scientific data to support ID’s claims, the Discovery Institute has promoted ID politically to the public, education officials and public policymakers through its Teach the Controversy campaign.

Johnson's statements validate the criticisms leveled by those who allege that the Discovery Institute and its allied organizations are merely stripping the obvious religious content from their anti-evolution assertions as a means of avoiding the legal restriction on establishment. They argue that ID is simply an attempt to put a patina of secularity on top of what is a fundamentally religious belief and agenda.

Given the history of the Discovery Institute as an organization committed to opposing any scientific theory inconsistent with "the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubtheo.com/savedpages/discovery-institute-wedge-document.pdf The "Wedge Document": So What?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050512085720/http://www.pubtheo.com/savedpages/discovery-institute-wedge-document.pdf |date=2005-05-12 }} Discovery Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; many scientists regard the movement purely as a ploy to insert creationism into the science curriculum rather than as a serious attempt to discuss scientific evidence. In the words of [[Eugenie Scott]] of the National Center for Education:
{{quotation|Teach the controversy' is a deliberately ambiguous phrase. It means 'pretend to students that scientists are arguing over whether evolution took place.' This is not happening. I mean you go to the scientific journals, you go to universities... and you ask the professors, is there an argument going on about whether living things had common ancestors? They'll look at you blankly. This is not a controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/US/418_creation_conflict_in_schools_3_29_2005.asp "Creation Conflict in Schools"] National Center for Science Education.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though Teach the Controversy proponents cite the current public policy statements of the Discovery Institute as belying the criticisms that their strategy is a creationist ploy and decry critics as biased in failing to recognize that the intelligent design movement's Teach the Controversy strategy as really just a question of science with no religion involved, is itself belied by Discovery Institute's former published policy statements,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19970514072337/http://www.discovery.org/crsc/aboutcrsc.html What is The Center for the Renewal of Science &amp; Culture All About?] &lt;br/&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/19970514073708/http://www.discovery.org/crsc/crscmisn.html The Mission of The Center for Renewal of Science &amp; Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; its "Wedge Document", and statements made to its constituency by its leadership, and in particular Phillip E.

Establishing that point isn't enough, but it is absolutely essential to the rest of the gospel message. ... The first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion. ...This is not to say that the biblical issues are unimportant; the point is rather that the time to address them will be after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/le_wedge.htm The Wedge Breaking the Modernist Monopoly on Science] Phillip E. Johnson. ARN.org.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Johnson's words bolster the claims of those critics who cite Johnson's admission that the ultimate goal of the campaign is getting "the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools."&lt;ref name=intelligent_darwin/&gt;

Amid this political and religious controversy the clear, categorical and oft-repeated view of established national and international scientific organizations remains that there is no ''scientific'' controversy over teaching evolution in public schools.

===University course===
[[George Mason University]] Biology Department introduced a 1-credit course on the creation/evolution controversy, and Emmett Holman, an associate professor of philosophy from the university, found that as students learn more about biology, they find [[objections to evolution]] less convincing. He concluded that "teaching the controversy" would undermine creationists’ criticisms, and that the scientific community’s resistance to this approach was bad public relations. Rather than being taught in a mainstream science course, it would be a separate elective course, probably taught by a scientist but called a course on "philosophy of science", "history of science", or "politics of science and religion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/02_Events/Lectures/2006/02_Lecture_2006_0420.shtml AAAS Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421015554/http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/02_Events/Lectures/2006/02_Lecture_2006_0420.shtml |date=2006-04-21 }}, 20 April 2006, Emmett Holman, Associate Professor of Philosophy from George Mason University, retrieved 2007-04-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist Tom A. Langen argues in a journal letter entitled ''"What is right with ‘teaching the controversy’?"'' that offering a specific course about this controversy will help students understand the demarcation between science and other ways of obtaining knowledge about nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=What is right with ‘teaching the controversy’? |first=Tom A. |last=Langen |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=114–115 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2003.12.005 |pmid=16701239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar positions have been expressed by atheists [[Julian Baggini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Baggini |authorlink=Julian Baggini |date=2007-06-15 |title=Why we should learn Intelligent Design |work=Times Educational Supplement |publisher=TSL Education Ltd |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/search/story/?story_id=2397963 |accessdate=2008-06-27 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aaron Sloman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Sloman |authorlink=Aaron Sloman |title=Why scientists and philosophers of science should teach intelligent design (ID) alongside the theory of evolution |url=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/id/ |accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wormy''''', drawn and written by [[David A. Trampier]], was a fantasy [[comic strip]] about a talking dragon named Wormy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/133338-Old-School-AD-D-Artist-David-Trampier-aka-D-A-T-Is-Gone|title=Old-School AD&amp;D Artist David Trampier aka D.A.T.

Trampier, the Illustrator Who Defined the Look of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Has Passed Away, 1954-2014|work=Tor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 1977 issue of ''Dragon'' (Issue #9) featured the first 6-panel comic of ''Wormy''. The first comic featured the title character, a [[cigar]]-chomping, [[pool hustling]], [[wargaming]] [[dragon]], and subsequent issues revealed the cast of goblins and ogres who were his neighbors and friends. ''Wormy'' continued to appear in ''Dragon'' for the next 10 years, until Issue #132 (April 1988).

==Disappearance==
In the late 1980s, ''Wormy'' creator David A. Trampier abruptly vanished from public life.  The final installment of ''Wormy'' ended the strip in the middle of an unfinished storyline. No further ''Wormy'' comics were ever published.&lt;ref name="D&amp;Dfaq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp |title = ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' FAQ |accessdate=2008-10-03 |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_FAQ.asp&amp;date=2008-10-03 |archivedate=October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
