The '''Battle of Dengbu Island''' ({{zh|c=登步島戰役|p=Dēngbù Dǎo Zhànyì}}) was a conflict between the [[Republic of China Army]] and [[People's Liberation Army]] over [[Dengbu Island]] (in the [[Zhoushan Islands]]) near [[mainland China]]. This conflict occurred from 3 November 1949 to 5 November 1949 and resulted in a [[Republic of China]] victory.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://museum.mnd.gov.tw/Publish.aspx?cnid=1444&amp;p=12176 | title=戡亂暨臺海戰役 |trans-title=Counter-insurgency Campaign and Battle of the Taiwan Strait | publisher=國軍歷史文物館 | language=zh-tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the ROC was later forced to withdraw when the PRC gained air superiority over the region, leaving Dengbu Island in the control of the PRC.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

'''Bergitka Roma''' or '''Carpathian Roma''' (also ''"Polish Highlander Gypsies"'' in some works) are a [[Romani people|Roma]] ethnic sub-group, living mostly in [[Poland]]. They were one of the first, if not the first, group of Roma to [[Human migration|migrate]] to Poland, mostly from the territories of the [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of Hungary]] and [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], through the [[Carpathian mountains]], sometime during the 15th century. The name ''Bergitka'' (sometimes ''Bergare'') is actually the term for the group used by other Roma groups, originating in [[German language|German]] "berg" or "mountain". The members of the group refers to themselves simply as "Rroma" or "amare Roma".

Their [[dialect]] of the [[Roma language]], [[Carpathian Romani]], contains many loan words from [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and it has also preserved some grammar and tense structure of Hungarian. Unlike many other Romani dialects of Eastern and Central Europe, it lacks any influence from German.&lt;ref name=bartosz/&gt;

Bergitka Roma are non-[[nomadic]] and have lived a settled existence since at least the 18th century. For this reason, and because their interpretation of traditional Roma laws and customs, [[Romanipen]], is regarded as lax by other groups of Roma, other Roma accord them a low social status. Bergitka Roma in turn regard non-Bergitka Roma as of low social status and as "inauthentic Roma".&lt;ref name=bartosz/&gt;

Traditional occupations of Bergitka Roma have been [[blacksmith|iron working]] and music.

Until [[World War II]] they lived mostly in the rural countryside of the Carpathian highlands, but after the war began moving to larger cities of [[Malopolska]], such as [[Kraków]], [[Tarnów]], and [[Rzeszów]]. Many of them also moved to the [[Recovered Territories]] in the west of Poland. Currently they live mostly in the [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Subcarpathian]], [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Lesser Poland]], [[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesian]] and [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Lower Silesian]] [[voivodeships]].&lt;ref name=bartosz&gt;Adam Bartosz, "Nie boj sie cygana/Na dara rromesoar", Pograniczne, Sejny, 1994, pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Bergitka communities also exist in [[Slovakia]], close to the Polish-Slovak border.

== Synopsis ==

Students at a school with the band [[Super7 (band)|Super7]], Sonya (Bella Anastasya), Mella (Rebeca), Kiki (Shifa Bella), and Adisty (Khanza), are inspired to form a [[girl group]]. They form the band D'Pinks, triggering fierce competition with Super7.

Competition between D'pinks and Super7 increasingly heats up when they become representatives of their school to compete in a singing championship event. Every effort is made by Super7 to deter D'Pinks, but their efforts fail. Through ingenuity and struggle, D'Pinks win the competition.

Competition between D'Pinks and Super7 also occurs in other activities at the school. Mella and Jose always compete in every science competition, and there is an internal problem among parents.

'''COSMO-1''' or '''COSMO-Skymed 1''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[radar imaging]] satellite. Launched in 2007, it was the first of four [[COSMO-Skymed]] satellites to be placed into orbit. The spacecraft is operated by the [[Italian Space Agency|Agenzia Spaziale Italiana]], the Italian space agency, in conjunction with Italy's [[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministry of Defence]]. It uses [[synthetic aperture radar]] to produce images for civilian, commercial and military purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asi.it/en/activity/earth_observation/cosmoskymed|title=COSMO-SkyMed|publisher=Agenzia Spaziale Italiana|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COSMO-1 was constructed by [[Thales Alenia Space]], based on the [[Prima (spacecraft bus)|Prima]] bus. It was the first Prima-based spacecraft to be launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/alenia_prima.htm|title=Alenia Aerospace → Thales Alenia: Prima|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed for a five-year mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/cosmo-skymed-1.htm|title=COSMO 1, 2, 3, 4|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the satellite remains operational {{as of|2013}}.

ASI awarded [[Boeing]] a contract to launch COSMO-1, with the launch being subcontracted to [[United Launch Alliance]] when it was formed to take over Delta launch operations. The launch took place at 02:34:00 UTC on 8 June 2007. A [[Delta II]] rocket in the 7420-10C configuration, flight number Delta 324, lifted off from [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 2|Space Launch Complex 2W]] at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], successfully injecting the satellite into low Earth orbit. Spacecraft separation occurred 58&amp;nbsp;minutes and 5&amp;nbsp;seconds after liftoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/delta/d324/status.html|title=Delta Mission Report - Mission Status Center|first=Justin|last=Ray|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=8 June 2007|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite operates in a [[sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous]] [[low Earth orbit]]. As of {{Orbit|Epoch|25 January 2015}} it was located in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|{{Orbit|perigee|628}}|km|mi}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|{{Orbit|apogee|630}}|km|mi}}, [[orbital inclination|inclined]] at {{Orbit|inclination|97.88}}&amp;nbsp;degrees to the equator. It has an [[orbital period]] of {{Orbit|period|97.16}}&amp;nbsp;minutes, with [[right ascension of the ascending node]] of {{Orbit|RAAN|211.26}}&amp;nbsp;degrees and an [[argument of perigee]] of {{Orbit|arg of perigee|84.67}}&amp;nbsp;degrees.{{Orbit|ref|&lt;ref name="n2yo"/&gt;}}

The '''Cocosates''' were an [[Aquitani]] pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tribe settled in what today is southwestern [[France]], at north of the river [[Adour]]. They were surrounded by the [[Tarbelli]] at south and the [[Boiates]] at north. They inhabited what today is the western part of the [[France|French]] department of [[Landes (department)|Landes]].

== History ==

They were called ''Cocosates sexsignani'' by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], meaning ''Cocosates of the six banners'', which means they were actually a confederacy of six tribes. They lived in present-day [[Landes (department)|Landes]], at north of the [[Adour]], in [[Brassenx]].

Their name, ''Cocosates'' is similar to the [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''kokots'', which means "chin". It probably comes from the [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] or [[Proto-Basque language|Proto-Basque]] root ''koiz'' or ''coç'', meaning "hill", or "height", root which is also present in ''Cossium'', the capital of the [[Vasates (tribe)]].

The '''Council of European National Top-Level Domain Registries''' ('''CENTR''') is the association of European [[Internet]] [[ccTLD|country code top-level domain]] [[domain name registry|registries]], such as .de for Germany or .si for Slovenia. CENTR currently counts 54 full and 9 associate members – together, they are responsible for over 80% of all registered domain names worldwide. The objectives of CENTR are to promote and participate in the development of high standards and best practices among ccTLD registries. Full membership is open to organisations, corporate bodies or individuals that operate a country code top level domain registry.

The project that became CENTR was formed in March 1998 and was informally funded by participating registries. In 1999, it was legally established as a not-for-profit company in the UK. Since 2006, CENTR is registered as a non-for-profit organisation based in Brussels, Belgium. CENTR activities are funded by membership fees, and performed by a secretariat based in Brussels.

The organisation has a European focus, but there are no geographical restrictions to membership. In addition to more than forty of the countries in the region, CENTR is very pleased to have as members the country code registries from a number of countries outside of Europe (such as Iran, Japan, New Zealand and Canada). CENTR welcomes the application from all country code managers.

CENTR provides a forum to discuss matters of policy affecting ccTLD registries and acts as a channel of communication to Internet governing bodies and other organisations involved with the Internet. It promotes the interests of ccTLDs and advocates on their behalf.

The rules and registration procedures of ccTLD registries vary considerably and CENTR aims to collect information on, and document the practices of ccTLD registries. It provides a focal point for enquiries on such matters and encourages amongst ccTLDs the provision of better service for users.

CENTR also facilitates collaborative projects on technical managerial and legal issues affecting ccTLDs.

The '''ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters''', simply called the '''Survey of Professional Forecasters''', is a quarterly survey of macroeconomic forecasts for the [[economy of Europe]] issued by the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB).&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/prices/indic/forecast/html/index.en.html|title = ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters|publisher = [[European Central Bank]]|accessdate = April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters was started in 1999.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp8.pdf|title = An Introduction to the ECB's Survey of Professional Forecasters|author = Juan Angel Garcia|date = September 2003|publisher = [[European Central Bank]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the ECB published a review of the survey based on eight years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp59.pdf|title = The ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters: A Review After Eight Years of Experience|date = April 2007|author = Carlos Bowles|author2 = Roberta Friz|author3 = Veronique Genre|author4 = Geoff Kenny|author5 = Aidan Meyler|author6 = Tuomas Rautanen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Academic research===

The ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters has been the subject of some academic research, including a 2013 paper considering whether there was a better way of combining the forecasts than simply taking the average. They found some methods of combining that did better than the average, but noted that it was not clear that these methods would continue to beat the average in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Combining expert forecasts: Can anything beat the simple average?|last = Genre|first = Veronique|last2 = Kenny|first2 = Geoff|last3 = Meyler|first3 = Aidan|last4 = Timmermann|first4 = Aidan|doi = 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2012.06.004|journal = [[International Journal of Forecasting]]|publisher = [[International Institute of Forecasters]] in collaboration with [[Elsevier]]|volume = 29|year = 2013|pages = 108-121}}&lt;!--|accessdate = April 23, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Echternacher Anzeiger''''' was a [[newspaper]] published in [[Luxembourg]] between 1863 and 1940.

The ''Echternacher Anzeiger'' started business on 10 May 1863. It was published twice a week in Echternach, first by Dominik Burg, later by his son Joseph Burg, then by the latter's son, also named Joseph Burg.&lt;ref&gt;Romain Hilgert: [http://www.gouvernement.lu/publications/download/zeitungen_FR_2004.pdf ''Les journaux au Luxembourg. 1704-2004''], p. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

It had a small readership — in 1865 it sold about 160 copies — and mainly consisted of articles which had already been published elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Hilgert 2004"&gt;Hilgert 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, it developed the ambition to grow beyond its local basis, and even beyond the national borders, as evidenced by its byline: "a national newspaper. An organ for the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg and the neighbouring areas".

Its publication ended on 31 December 1940.

اسلمى يا مصر إننى الفدا

ذى يدى إن مدت الدنيا يدا

أبدا لن تستكينى أبدا

إننى أرجو مع اليوم غدا

ومعى قلبى وعزمى للجهاد

ولقلبى أنت بعد الدين دين

''لك  يا مصر السلامة''

''وسلاما يا بلادى''

''إن رمى الدهر سهامه''

''أتقيها بفؤادى''

''واسلمى فى كل حين''

أنا مصرى بنانى من بنى
 
هرم الدهر الذى أعيا الفنا

وقفة الأهرام فيما بيننا

لصروف الدهر وقفتى أنا

فى دفاعى وجهادى للبلاد

لا أميل لا أمل لا ألين

''لك  يا مصر السلامة''

''وسلاما يا بلادى''

''إن رمى الدهر سهامه''

''أتقيها بفؤادى''

''واسلمى فى كل حين''

ويك يا من رام تقييد الفلك

أى نجم فى السما يخضع لك

وطن الحر سمًا لا تمتلك

والفتى الحر بأفقه ملك

لا عدا يا أرض مصر بكى عاد

أننا دون حماكى أجمعين

''لك  يا مصر السلامة''

''وسلاما يا بلادى''

''إن رمى الدهر سهامه''

''أتقيها بفؤادى''

''واسلمى فى كل حين''

للعلا أبناء مصر للعلا
 
وبمصر شرفوا المستقبلا

وفدًا لمصرنا الدنيا فلا

نضع الأوطان إلا أولا

جانبى الأيسر قلبه الفؤاد

وبلادى هى لى قلبى اليمين

''لك  يا مصر السلامة''

''وسلاما يا بلادى''

''إن رمى الدهر سهامه''

''أتقيها بفؤادى''

&lt;poem&gt;Be safe, O Egypt; I will sacrifice

There is my hand for you, if the world raised a hand [to hurt you]

Never you shall yield, ever

I am hoping for tomorrow [to be better]

My heart and my determination are with me for strife

And to my heart, O Egypt, you are a faith, in addition to my religion

''Safety for you, O Egypt

And peace, O my homeland

If the world threw arrows [at you]

I would shield you by my heart

And be safe in all times''

I am an Egyptian, built by the founders of the

everlasting pyramid, who defeated doom

The pyramids stand beside us

Against the world's arrogance, is as my stand

In my defense and struggle for my country

I do not turn away, tire, or yield

''Safety for you, O Egypt

And Peace, O my homeland

If the world threw arrows [at you]

I would shield you by my heart

And be safe in all times''

Hey, you who are trying to chain our orbits

There is no star in the sky under your control

The homeland of freemen is a sky that cannot be possessed

And the freemen own its horizons

There is no enemy that can attack you, O land of Egypt

We are all for your protection

''Safety for you, O Egypt

And Peace, O my homeland

If the world threw arrows [at you]

I would shield you by my heart

And be safe in all times''

To highness, O sons of Egypt, to highness

And honor the future by Egypt

The whole world is to save our Egypt, because

we put our country's sake first

My left side has my heart

And my homeland is the heart of my right side

''Safety for you, O Egypt

And Peace, O my homeland

If the world threw arrows [at you]

I would shield you by my heart

And be safe in all times''
&lt;/poem&gt;

The typical ''album'' is printed in large format, generally with high quality paper and colouring, roughly [[ISO 216|A4]]-sized, approx. 21x30 centimetres (8.4x11.6 in), has around 40–60 pages, but examples with more than 100 pages are common. While sometimes referred to as [[graphic novel]]s, this term is rarely used in Europe, and is not always applicable as albums often consist of separate short stories, placing them somewhere halfway between a comic book and a graphic novel. The European comic genres vary from the humorous adventure vein, such as ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://europeisnotdead.com/video/images-of-europe/european-comics/|title=European Comics|date=2013-04-29|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; to more adult subjects like ''[[Tex Willer]]'', ''[[Diabolik]]'', and ''[[Thorgal]]''.

==History==
The roots of European on-paper comics date back to 18th century [[caricature]]s (mocking others styles or behaviors) and illustrated picture books such as [[Wilhelm Busch]]'s [[Max and Moritz]]. The early 19th century [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist [[Rodolphe Töpffer]] is regarded by many as the "father of the modern comic" and his publication ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois]]'' is sometimes called the first "comic book".&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott McCloud|McCloud, Scott]], ''[[Understanding Comics|Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art]]''. New York: Harper Collins &amp; Kitchen Sink Press. 1994. {{ISBN|0-06-097625-X}}, pg 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franco-Belgian comics]], [[Spanish comics]], and [[Italian comics]] are historically amongst the dominant scenes of European comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/11/moebius-and-beyond-an-introduction-to-european-com.html|title=Moebius and Beyond: An Introduction to European Comics|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, paintings, depicting stories in subsequent frames, using descriptive text resembling bubbles-text, were used in murals, one such example witten in [[Greek_language|Greek]], dating to the [[2nd century]], found in [[Capitolias#Archaeology|Capitolias]], today in [[Jordan]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ancient-comics-line-roman-era-tomb-jordan-180970400/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Festivals==
A number of festivals celebrating comic art are held around Europe.  These include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2051">The Global Power Barometer (GPB) is a tool that measures which nations, ideologies or movements are most powerful based on how successfully they influence global opinion and events.

== About ==

Located on PostGlobal, washingtonpost.com and Newsweek.com’s panel blog on international issues, the Global Power Barometer (GPB) is a visual monitor updated each weekday by the research firm Denver Research Group, Inc. (DRGI) using a weighted sample of sources from the media, academia, governments, and NGOs from around the world. The GPB offers an indication of the most powerful nations and ideologies on any given day. PostGlobal is hosted by journalists [[Fareed Zakaria]] and [[David Ignatius]].

== Transparency in Reporting ==

Clicking on “Decoding Today’s Chart” takes you to a bulleted explanation of the observations and drivers for the current chart, as well as archived paragraphs from earlier days and weeks. Clicking on an individual country or group on the chart displays a representative sample of sources used in determining the power shift for that day.

== Looking at What’s Next ==

As it tracks and analyzes information from across the world, the GPB often comes across issues that the PostGlobal branch of DRGI thinks will impact [[global politics]]. These are the issues that likely will move the icons in coming weeks. The “What’s Next” button lets a reader access “Emerging Issues,” which is a listing of issues, players, events, political intrigues or other items that the PostGlobal team believes may become important in coming days or weeks.

== Tracking Movements ==

The reader can click on the time bar at the top of the chart to watch movement of the icons over the current week. Clicking on any of the dates stops the chart at that specific date. The movement in previous weeks can also be viewed by clicking “Other Weeks.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8885">'''Globality''' is the end-state of [[globalization]] &amp;ndash; a hypothetical condition in which the process of globalization is complete or nearly so, barriers have fallen, and "a new global reality" is emerging. 

The term was used in 1998 by author and economist [[Daniel Yergin]] in a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article that described the end-state of the globalization process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel |last=Yergin |coauthors= |title=The Age Of 'Globality' |date=1998-05-18 |publisher= |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/92486?tid=relatedcl |work=Newsweek |pages= |accessdate=2008-07-18 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323082216/http://www.newsweek.com/id/92486?tid=relatedcl |archivedate=March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book, ''[[Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy]]''.  Though Yergin was credited with having coined it, the word is in fact much older. [[William Safire]] traces the etymology of “globality” in his book ''No Uncertain Terms''&lt;ref&gt;Safire, William. (2004). ''No Uncertain Terms: More Writing from the Popular "On Language" Column in The New York Times Magazine'', Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|0-7432-5812-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-5812-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and identifies a range of citations as far back as 1942, when it was used as a synonym for “global.” Current use of “globality” as it applies to business – as a description of the current competitive state of world commerce – was not adopted until recently. The book: Globality: Competing with Everyone from Everywhere for Everything, Hal Sirkin Jim Hemerling Arindam Bhattacharya June 11, 2008, elaborates on how 'challenger' businesses from rapidly developing economies abroad are aggressively and inventively overtaking existing 'incumbent' nations.  

The term has been described by William J. Holstein in the ''[[New York Times]]'' as "a new buzzword [that] doesn’t work — it merely describes trends that have been under way for at least two decades under a very similar name."&lt;ref&gt;Holstein, William J. (2008). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/29/business/29shelf.html "The American Multinational, Unbowed,"] ''The New York Times'', June 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

According to all these authors, globality is what comes next after globalization: a new state of worldwide hyper-competition. Sirkin et al. (2008) further detail globality’s three main features as they apply to commerce and business:
# A significant structural shift in the flow of commerce: companies from every part of the world are now competing with each other for “everything” – customers, suppliers, partners, capital, intellectual property, raw materials, distribution systems, manufacturing capabilities, and most important, talent. In this competitive free-for-all, products and services flow from many locations to many destinations.
# A breakdown in the established hierarchy of commercial power and influence: power is shifting away from traditional centers of influence in developed markets in the United States, Europe, and Japan, as companies from rapidly developing economies (RDEs) are quickly assuming leadership positions in global markets, forcing established leaders to compete on new terms.
# The emergence of new business and governance practices better suited to a truly global and decentralized business environment. To compete successfully in a world of globality, established industry leaders from developed markets are being forced to learn from competitors in developing markets. The practices include shifting autonomy and decision making outward to satellite operations; redeploying assets to build commerce within emerging regions; and expanding quickly into new markets to match the speed and scale with which challengers are rising.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== History ==

Yergin’s chief distinction between globality and globalization is conceptual – he says that former is a “condition” while the latter is a “process.” He describes globality as the end-state of the process of globalization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The borders that constrained commerce―but also protected companies from the full brunt of competition―are eroding. Governments are retreating from control of the commanding heights of their economies: they are privatizing and deregulating. Barriers to trade and investment are coming down rapidly. Ever-cheaper communications and ever-faster computers, along with the Internet, are facilitating the flow of goods and services, as well as knowledge and information. Increasingly, companies are integrating their global strategies with global capital markets. {{Cite quote|date=May 2012}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their book, Sirkin et al. (2008) focus on the business conditions that emerge &amp;ndash; and the challenges for management &amp;ndash; once the state of globality is established. They distinguish globality from [[globalization]] based on the emergence of a new set of competitive dynamics between established leaders from developed economies and challenger companies from developing economies. With respect to global business, they argue that the three fundamental characteristics of globalization were these:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Established industry leaders―known as “incumbents”―from the developed economies of the United States, Europe, and Japan &amp;ndash; relocated their manufacturing activities to developing countries in order to lower the cost of production and, accordingly, reduce the price of their goods offered in their home markets.
# The incumbents also began to sell their offerings―usually with few if any modifications for local consumers―into the low-cost markets and enjoyed incremental sales gains, as the consumer economies began to grow in these countries.
# Local companies in developing economies acted primarily as suppliers, jobbers, and local distribution partners, to these established industry leaders. {{Cite quote|date=May 2012}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this traditional model of globalization, the flow of commerce was predominantly from West to East and followed established Western business practices. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

According to Sirkin et al., globality is a totally different kind of environment &amp;ndash; one in which the competitive landscape has changed dramatically. In today’s new phase of worldwide trade and economic development, companies are “competing with everyone from everywhere for everything.” And while there is no ultimate model for success, no surefire strategy for innovation and growth, emerging-market challengers have evolved new management and governance structures that are ideally suited to this new competitive reality.

'''Luxembourgish Brazilians''' refers to Brazilian citizens of full, partial, or predominantly [[Luxembourg]]ish ancestry, or Luxembourg-born immigrants in [[Brazil]]. There are an estimated 50,000 Brazilians of partial Luxembourgish descent.

Luxembourgish immigration to Brazil occurred mainly around 1828, when nearly 1,000 Luxembourgers settled there.&lt;ref&gt;"De L'Etat à la nation 1839-1989" Imprimeries St. Paul p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mfalikuivahaas''' ("one who is courageous and can address the public") are of chieftain bloodlines, '[[Mfalme]]s', 'Chiefs', from [[Southern Africa]] at a time when [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n civilizations were rich in luxury products including incense, gold, ivory, and ebony. The name Mfalikuivahaa was better known when many areas in Africa were ruled through forms of governance that place power in the hands of a small, privileged ruling class of elders, leaders, and [[Shamanism|Shamans]]. Such a tribal assembly played an important role in the lives of many Africans contrasting as a form of governance to direct democracy today.

== Origins ==
=== Aggrandizing the dynasty ===
In the late 1700s, early 1800s the area that became [[Tanganyika]], and then [[Tanzania]], a part of the [[Great Lakes region]], consisted of many small kingdoms/ [[Chieftain (disambiguation)|Chieftains]]. A legitimate function of Chiefs was to aggrandize their dynasties and increase the territory and power of family members. Families of Chiefs sent their children (with the assistance of lower-rank rulers, as well as a large number and levels of advisers who for the most part also occupy their positions by virtue of their family or clan origins and status) to rule or act as security within neighbouring lands of friendly chieftains. This ensured trust in high ranking circles, non-contestation of seats enthroned to siblings in addition to other reciprocal obligations fulfilled by the families carrying out rituals on behalf of the communities. Such mechanisms ascertained that the chief does not rule arbitrarily. In the late 1800s there was a dispersal of the children/grandchildren of Mfalikuivahaa to the outposts where each was said to have made his or her mark in the subsequent urbanization and consolidation of the alliance of chieftains with each child or grandchild fashioning his or her state after their origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Societies, Networks, and Transitions: A Global History|last = Craig Lockhard|first = David|publisher = Cencage Learning|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Songea - Salubwiti Mfalikuivahaa ===
Salubwiti and Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa journeyed through Malawi and moved to the [[Ruvuma Region]] where Salubwiti Mfalikuivahaa remained to rule in the Namtumbo area while Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa travelled north-seeking land to locate his chieftain. Germans occupied the area around the Great Lakes region since 1897 completely altering many aspects of everyday life. They were actively supported by the [[Missionaries of Charity|missionaries]] who attempted to change all indigenous beliefs, notably by razing the 'mahoka' huts where the local population worshiped their ancestors' spirits and by scorning their [[rites]], dances and other ceremonies.[[Songea]], (Ruvuma) was the centre of African resistance during the [[Maji Maji Rebellion]] in [[German East Africa]] temporarily uniting a number of southern tribes.

=== Lubiki Lwamtwa, ‘the staff of a Chief’ - Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa ===
Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa travelled to Utengule where he befriended and was welcomed by Chief Toigali Soliambingu of the [[Bena people]]. Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa was installed as head of the chieftain security. Historically, the family members of chiefs in the many kingdoms/ chieftains became soldiers and can trace their origins to military leaders from the migration period. The fundamental idea of a leader was that of essential superiority of the fighting man, usually maintained in the granting of arms. The spear was an outward and visible sign of a "leader and a hunter”. As the best friend of Chief Toigali, Kamonga was given the name Lubiki, ‘the staff of a Chief’ as one is often found next to a Chief.

=== Settling in the Mngeta area ===
A tradition of Bena people included burying the Chief’s right-hand man with him, as an escort in the [[after life]], upon the Chief’s death. Chief Toigali Soliambingi’s death lead Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa to flee the chieftain and finally settle in the Mngeta area ([[Kilombero District]]) where he instituted his own, clan seat, seat of the Chief. Practicing polygamy, Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa had forty wives yet only two children from two of his wives, Abiba Makwega and Joahali Makwega. Each of the Makwega sisters had a child, Mohammed and Mira Lubiki Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa . Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa died when his children were infants and his son Mohammed Lubiki grew up with his uncles in [[Mofu]]. Mohammed Lubiki went on to have four daughters and four sons with Mdasula Zaina Kitabu. Mohammed Lubiki Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa now referred to simply as Lubiki, inherited his father’s physical strength and was an exceptionally skilled hunter well known for having the house feeding the chieftain.

== The ‘Mfalikuivahaas’ today ==
The Chiefs were suspicious of foreign missionary schools as they thought that a foreign product might prove to have evolved too suddenly in a different world discounting a general view that future constitutional development in Tanzania depended more on the Western educated elite than on the hitherto favoured traditional rulers. ‘Mohammed’ of Islamic inclinations as a result of the Arabization of much of the Tanganyikan population, calculating his sons would remain to rule in the region, only sent his four daughters to be stewarded by Sister Solana (Baldegger sisters, [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]]) in [[Ifakara]].

In the 1960s, East Africa’s nationalists set out to build independent states by dismantling tribes and chieftains. ‘A truly socialist state is one in which all people are workers and in which neither capitalism nor feudalism exists”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Freedom and Unity|last = Julius|first = Nyerere|publisher = |year = 1967|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There followed the largest resettlement effort in the history of Africa: nearly 70 percent of Tanzania’s rural people were uprooted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethnic Patriotism and the East African Revival: A History of Dissent, c.1935 ...|last = Peterson|first = Derek|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in collective villages. Alongside the growth of nationalist movements among the educated elite and the organization of trade unions among workers, there was a disruption of chieftain family politics, a restructuring of ethnic identification, and a resort to modern solutions.

Several members of the family are now educated abroad in Swiss private schools (alongside leaders including [[Kim Jong-un]]; the supreme leader of North Korea), the United Kingdom and United States.

{{NSA surveillance|1|2|3}}
The '''National Security Agency''' ('''NSA''') is a national-level [[intelligence agency]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]], under the authority of the [[Director of National Intelligence]]. The NSA is responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign intelligence and [[counterintelligence]] purposes, specializing in a discipline known as [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT). The NSA is also tasked with the [[Information assurance|protection]] of U.S. communications networks and information systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About NSA: Mission|publisher=National Security Agency |url=https://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/index.shtml|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakashima" /&gt; The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are [[clandestine operations|clandestine]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Executive Order 13470]] – [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-2008-08-04/pdf/WCPD-2008-08-04-Pg1064.pdf 2008 Amendments to Executive Order 12333], United States Intelligence Activities'', July 30, 2008 (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in [[World War II]], it was officially formed as the NSA by President [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1952. Since then, it has become the largest of the [[U.S. intelligence community#Organization|U.S. intelligence organizations]] in terms of personnel and budget.&lt;ref name="wapoblack1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bamford|Bamford, James]]. ''[[Body of Secrets]]: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency'', [[Random House Digital, Inc.]], December 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA currently conducts [[mass surveillance|worldwide mass data collection]] and has been known to physically [[bugging|bug]] electronic systems as one method to this end.&lt;ref&gt;Malkin, Bonnie. ''NSA surveillance: US bugged EU offices''. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', June 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA has also been alleged to have been behind such attack software as [[Stuxnet]], which severely damaged Iran's nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;Ngak, Chenda.

SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass "close surveillance, burglary, wiretapping, [and] breaking and entering".&lt;ref name=today01&gt;{{cite episode |credits=[[Ann Curry]] (anchor), John Pike (guest), [[Pete Williams (journalist)|Pete Williams]] (guest) and [[James Bamford]] (guest) |title=Congress to Hold Closed Hearings on Accused Spy Robert Hanssen Later This Week |series=Today |serieslink=Today (U.S. TV program) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=February 27, 2001 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2001/010227-spy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lichtblau01&gt;{{cite news |last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Lichtblau |title=Spy Suspect May Have Revealed U.S. Bugging; Espionage: Hanssen left signs that he told Russia where top-secret overseas eavesdropping devices are placed, officials say |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 28, 2001  |page=A1 | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/updates2/lat_spy010228.htm | archivedate=April 17, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417230720/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/updates2/lat_spy010228.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the CIA and the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), both of which specialize primarily in foreign [[Clandestine HUMINT|human espionage]], the NSA does not publicly conduct human-source intelligence gathering. The NSA is entrusted with providing assistance to, and the coordination of, SIGINT elements for other government organizations – which are prevented by law from engaging in such activities on their own.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Executive Order 13470]] – [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-2008-08-04/pdf/WCPD-2008-08-04-Pg1064.pdf 2008 Amendments to Executive Order 12333], United States Intelligence Activities'', Section C.2, July 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As part of these responsibilities, the agency has a co-located organization called the [[Central Security Service]] (CSS), which facilitates cooperation between the NSA and other U.S. defense [[cryptanalysis]] components. To further ensure streamlined communication between the signals [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] divisions, the [[Director of the National Security Agency|NSA Director]] simultaneously serves as the Commander of the [[United States Cyber Command]] and as Chief of the Central Security Service.

The NSA's actions have been a matter of political controversy on several occasions, including [[#Vietnam War|its spying on anti-Vietnam-war leaders]] and the agency's participation in [[economic espionage]]. In 2013, the NSA had many of its secret surveillance programs [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|revealed to the public]] by [[Edward Snowden]], a former NSA contractor. According to the leaked documents, the NSA intercepts and stores the communications of over a billion people worldwide, including United States citizens. The documents also revealed the NSA tracks hundreds of millions of people's movements using cellphones [[metadata]]. Internationally, research has pointed to the NSA's ability to surveil the domestic Internet traffic of foreign countries through "[[Network Sovereignty#Protection of National Traffic|boomerang routing]]".&lt;ref name="boomerang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Obar |first1=Jonathan A.|last2=Clement|first2=Andrew|title=Internet Surveillance and Boomerang Routing: A Call for Canadian Network Sovereignty|journal=TEM 2013: Proceedings of the Technology &amp; Emerging Media Track – Annual Conference of the Canadian Communication Association (Victoria, June 5–7, 2012)|date=2013|ssrn=2311792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The origins of the National Security Agency can be traced back to April 28, 1917, three weeks after the U.S. Congress declared war on Germany in [[World War I]]. A [[Code (cryptography)|code]] and [[cipher]] decryption unit was established as the Cable and Telegraph Section which was also known as the [[Cipher Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/center-cryptologic-history/pearl-harbor-review/black-chamber.shtml |title= The Black Chamber - Pearl Harbor Review |publisher= nsa.gov |accessdate= 23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was headquartered in Washington, D.C. and was part of the war effort under the executive branch without direct Congressional authorization. During the course of the war it was relocated in the army's organizational chart several times. On July 5, 1917, [[Herbert O. Yardley]] was assigned to head the unit. At that point, the unit consisted of Yardley and two [[civilian]] clerks. It absorbed the navy's [[Cryptanalysis]] functions in July 1918. World War I ended on November 11, 1918, and the army cryptographic section of Military Intelligence (MI-8) moved to New York City on May 20, 1919, where it continued intelligence activities as the Code Compilation Company under the direction of Yardley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/457.html|title=The National Archives, Records of the National Security Agency|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/cryptologic-spectrum/assets/files/many_lives.pdf |title=The Many Lives of Herbert O.

=== The Black Chamber ===
{{main|Black Chamber}}
[[File:Black Chamber cryptanalytic work sheet for solving Japanese diplomatic cipher, 1919 - National Cryptologic Museum - DSC07698.JPG|thumb|right|Black Chamber cryptanalytic work sheet for solving Japanese diplomatic cipher, 1919]]
After the disbandment of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] cryptographic section of military intelligence, known as MI-8, in 1919, the U.S. government created the Cipher Bureau, also known as Black Chamber. The Black Chamber was the United States' first peacetime [[cryptanalytic]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yardley|first=Herbert O.|title=The American black chamber|year=1931|publisher=[[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]]|location=Annapolis, MD|isbn=978-1-59114-989-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jointly funded by the Army and the State Department, the Cipher Bureau was disguised as a [[New York City]] [[commercial code (communications)|commercial code]] company; it actually produced and sold such codes for business use. Its true mission, however, was to break the communications (chiefly diplomatic) of other nations. Its most notable known success was at the [[Washington Naval Conference]], during which it aided American negotiators considerably by providing them with the decrypted traffic of many of the conference delegations, most notably the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].&lt;!-- partially copied from the article Black Chamber --&gt; The Black Chamber successfully persuaded [[Western Union]], the largest U.S. [[Telegraphy|telegram]] company at the time, as well as several other communications companies to illegally give the Black Chamber access to cable traffic of foreign embassies and consulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James Bamford|title=Building America's secret surveillance state|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/06/10/building-americas-secret-surveillance-state/|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, these companies publicly discontinued their collaboration.

Despite the Chamber's initial successes, it was shut down in 1929 by U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry L. Stimson]], who defended his decision by stating, "Gentlemen do not read each other's mail".&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hastedt|first1=Glenn P.|title=Spies, wiretaps, and secret operations: An encyclopedia of American espionage|year=2009|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-1-85109-807-1|page=32|author2=Guerrier, Steven W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II and its aftermath ===
During [[World War II]], the [[Signal Intelligence Service]] (SIS) was created to intercept and decipher the communications of the [[Axis powers]].&lt;ref name="armymil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Army Security Agency Established, 15 September 1945 |url=http://www.army.mil/article/110544/|publisher=[[United States Army]]|accessdate=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the war ended, the SIS was reorganized as the [[United States Army Security Agency|Army Security Agency]] (ASA), and it was placed under the leadership of the Director of Military Intelligence.&lt;ref name="armymil" /&gt;

On May 20, 1949, all cryptologic activities were centralized under a national organization called the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA).&lt;ref name="armymil" /&gt; This organization was originally established within the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] under the command of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;{{cite web|title=The Origins of the National Security Agency 1940–1952 (U)|last=Burns|first=Thomas L.|publisher=National Security Agency |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB278/02.PDF|format=PDF|accessdate=August 11, 2010|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AFSA was tasked to direct Department of Defense communications and electronic intelligence activities, except those of U.S. [[military intelligence]] units.&lt;ref name=Burns /&gt; However, the AFSA was unable to centralize [[COMINT|communications intelligence]] and failed to coordinate with civilian agencies that shared its interests such as the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).&lt;ref name=Burns /&gt; In December 1951, President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered a panel to investigate how AFSA had failed to achieve its goals. The results of the investigation led to improvements and its redesignation as the National Security Agency.&lt;ref name=NSApt2of3&gt;{{cite web|title=The Creation of NSA – Part 2 of 3: The Brownell Committee |url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/The_Creation_of_NSA_Part_3.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=National Security Agency|accessdate=July 2, 2013|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918015612/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/The_Creation_of_NSA_Part_3.pdf|archivedate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency was formally established by Truman in a memorandum of October 24, 1952, that revised [[National Security Council Intelligence Directives|National Security Council Intelligence Directive (NSCID) 9]].&lt;ref name=Truman&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum|author=Truman, Harry S. |url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/truman/truman_memo.pdf|format=PDF |publisher=National Security Agency|date=October 24, 1952 |accessdate=July 2, 2013|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821073605/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/truman/truman_memo.pdf|archivedate=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since President Truman's memo was a [[classified information|classified]] document,&lt;ref name=Truman /&gt; the existence of the NSA was not known to the public at that time. Due to its ultra-secrecy the U.S. intelligence community referred to the NSA as "No Such Agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/no-such-agency-spies-on-the-communications-of-the-world/2013/06/06/5bcd46a6-ceb9-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html|title='No Such Agency' spies on the communications of the world|last=Anne Gearan|date=June 7, 2013|work=|accessdate=November 9, 2013|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam War ===
{{Main|Project MINARET|NESTOR (encryption)}}
In the 1960s, the NSA played a key role in expanding U.S. commitment to the [[Vietnam War]] by providing evidence of a [[North Vietnam]]ese attack on the American destroyer {{USS|Maddox|DD-731|6}} during the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Shane |title=Vietnam Study, Casting Doubts, Remains Secret |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/31/politics/31war.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=October 31, 2005 |quote=The National Security Agency has kept secret since 2001 a finding by an agency historian that during the Tonkin Gulf episode, which helped precipitate the Vietnam War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A secret operation, code-named "[[Project MINARET|MINARET]]", was set up by the NSA to monitor the phone communications of Senators [[Frank Church]] and [[Howard Baker]], as well as major civil rights leaders, including [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and prominent U.S. journalists and athletes who criticized the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=Minaret&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-anti-vietnam-muhammad-ali-mlk "Declassified NSA Files Show Agency Spied on Muhammad Ali and MLK Operation Minaret Set Up in the 1960s to Monitor Anti-Vietnam Critics, Branded 'Disreputable If Not Outright Illegal' by NSA Itself"] ''The Guardian'', September 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project turned out to be controversial, and an internal review by the NSA concluded that its Minaret program was "disreputable if not outright illegal".&lt;ref name=Minaret /&gt;

The NSA mounted a major effort to secure tactical communications among U.S. forces during the war with mixed success. The [[NESTOR (encryption)|NESTOR]] family of compatible [[secure voice]] systems it developed was widely deployed during the [[Vietnam War]], with about 30,000 NESTOR sets produced. However a variety of technical and operational problems limited their use, allowing the North Vietnamese to exploit and intercept U.S. communications.&lt;ref name=boaklectures&gt;{{Cite book|last=Boak|first=David G.|title=A History of U.S. Communications Security; the David G.

=== Church Committee hearings ===
{{Further|Watergate scandal|Church Committee}}

In the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal]], a congressional hearing in 1975 led by Senator [[Frank Church]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/preemption/telecoms.html|title=Pre-Emption – The Nsa And The Telecoms – Spying On The Home Front – FRONTLINE – PBS|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that the NSA, in collaboration with Britain's SIGINT intelligence agency [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti-Vietnam war leaders such as [[Jane Fonda]] and Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Martin |date= |title=No Holiday: 80 Places You Don't Want to Visit |location=New York |publisher=Disinformation Company Ltd |isbn=978-1-932857-29-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Pj1_-1a79kkC&amp;dq=9781932857290 |accessdate=March 14, 2014|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agency tracked these individuals in a secret filing system that was destroyed in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Security Agency Tracking of U.S. Citizens – “Questionable Practices” from 1960s &amp; 1970s|editor=William Burr|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/cybervault-intelligence-nuclear-vault/2017-09-25/national-security-agency-tracking-us|accessdate=August 2, 2018|date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;Following the resignation of President [[Richard Nixon]], there were several investigations of suspected misuse of FBI, CIA and NSA facilities.&lt;ref name=Moyers-2007 /&gt; Senator [[Frank Church]] uncovered previously unknown activity,&lt;ref name=Moyers-2007 /&gt; such as a CIA plot (ordered by the administration of President [[John F.

After the Church Committee hearings, the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] of 1978 was passed into law. This was designed to limit the practice of [[mass surveillance in the United States]].&lt;ref name=Moyers-2007&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/10262007/profile2.html|title=The Church Committee and FISA|date=October 26, 2007|author=Bill Moyers Journal|publisher=Public Affairs Television|accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From 1980s to 1990s ===
In 1986, the NSA intercepted the communications of the Libyan government during the immediate aftermath of the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|Berlin discotheque bombing]]. The [[White House]] asserted that the NSA interception had provided "irrefutable" evidence that Libya was behind the bombing, which U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] cited as a justification for the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seymour M.

In 1999, a multi-year investigation by the European Parliament highlighted the NSA's role in economic espionage in a report entitled 'Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Peggy Becker |date=October 1999 |title=Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/cache/offonce/home/publications/studies?page=12 |publisher=STOA, European Parliament |page=12 |accessdate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the NSA founded the [[NSA Hall of Honor]], a memorial at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]] in Fort Meade, Maryland.&lt;ref name=SunHall /&gt; The memorial is a, "tribute to the pioneers and heroes who have made significant and long-lasting contributions to American cryptology".&lt;ref name=SunHall /&gt; NSA employees must be retired for more than fifteen years to qualify for the memorial.&lt;ref name=SunHall&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|title=NSA honors 4 in the science of codes |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-06-13/news/0306130156_1_cryptology-hall-of-honor-pioneers|date=June 13, 2003|work=The Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSA's infrastructure deteriorated in the 1990s as defense budget cuts resulted in maintenance deferrals. On January 24, 2000, NSA headquarters suffered a total network outage for three days caused by an overloaded network. Incoming traffic was successfully stored on agency servers, but it could not be directed and processed. The agency carried out emergency repairs at a cost of $3 million to get the system running again. (Some incoming traffic was also directed instead to Britain's [[GCHQ]] for the time being.) Director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] called the outage a "wake-up call" for the need to invest in the agency's infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency|author=James Bamford|page=454 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqY4Wr3T5K4C&amp;pg=PA454|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|date=2007|isbn=978-0-307-42505-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s the defensive arm of the NSA – the Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) –  started working more openly; the first public technical talk by an NSA scientist at a major cryptography conference was J. Solinas' presentation on
efficient Elliptic Curve Cryptography algorithms at Crypto 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koblitz|first=Neal|title=Random Curves: Journeys of a Mathematician|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2008|page=312|isbn=9783540740773}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAD's cooperative approach to academia and industry culminated in its support for a [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|transparent process]] for replacing the outdated [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES) by an [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES). Cybersecurity policy expert [[Susan Landau]] attributes the NSA's harmonious collaboration with industry and academia in the selection of the AES in 2000 — and the Agency's support for the choice of a strong encryption algorithm designed by Europeans rather than by Americans — to [[Brian Snow]], who was the Technical Director of IAD and represented the NSA as cochairman of the Technical Working Group for the AES competition, and [[Michael J. Jacobs (NSA)|Michael Jacobs]], who headed IAD at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Landau|first=Susan|title=NSA and Dual EC_DRBG: Deja vu all over again?|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=37|issue=4|year=2015|pages=72–83|doi=10.1007/s00283-015-9543-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}} 

After the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001]], the NSA believed that it had public support for a dramatic expansion of its surveillance activities.&lt;ref name="teleg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Sophie|title=Ex-NSA technical chief: How 9/11 created the surveillance state|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=13 November 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/11221287/Ex-NSA-technical-chief-How-911-created-the-surveillance-state.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Neal Koblitz]] and [[Alfred Menezes]], the period when the NSA was a trusted partner with academia and industry in the development of cryptographic standards started to come to an end when, as part of the change in the NSA in the post-September 11 era, Snow was replaced as Technical Director, Jacobs retired, and IAD could no longer effectively oppose proposed actions by the offensive arm of the NSA.&lt;ref&gt; "In 2002 Brian Snow was moved from the technical directorship of IAD to a different position within the NSA that had high status but little influence, particularly with regard to actions that were being proposed by SIGINT; Mike Jacobs retired from the NSA the same year." {{citation|last1=Koblitz|first1=Neal|last2=Menezes|first2=Alfred J.|title=A riddle wrapped in an enigma|journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy|volume=14|issue=6|year=2016|pages=34–42|doi=10.1109/MSP.2016.120}} Footnote 9 in the full version, see {{cite web|title=A riddle wrapped in an enigma|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf|access-date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War on Terror ===
In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], the NSA created new IT systems to deal with the flood of information from new technologies like the Internet and cellphones. [[ThinThread]] contained advanced [[data mining]] capabilities. It also had a "privacy mechanism"; surveillance was stored encrypted; decryption required a warrant. The research done under this program may have contributed to the technology used in later systems. ThinThread was cancelled when Michael Hayden chose [[Trailblazer Project|Trailblazer]], which did not include ThinThread's privacy system.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news|first=Siobhan |last=Gorman |title=NSA killed system that sifted phone data legally|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.nsa18may18,1,5386811.story|work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]] (Chicago, IL)|date=May 17, 2006 |accessdate=March 7, 2008|quote=The privacy protections offered by ThinThread were also abandoned in the post–September 11 push by the president for a faster response to terrorism.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193047/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.nsa18may18%2C1%2C5386811.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true|archivedate=September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trailblazer Project]] ramped up in 2002 and was worked on by [[Science Applications International Corporation]] (SAIC), [[Boeing]], [[Computer Sciences Corporation]], [[IBM]], and [[Litton Industries]]. Some NSA [[whistleblower]]s complained internally about major problems surrounding Trailblazer. This led to investigations by Congress and the NSA and DoD [[Inspectors General]]. The project was cancelled in early 2004.

[[Turbulence (NSA)|Turbulence]] started in 2005. It was developed in small, inexpensive "test" pieces, rather than one grand plan like Trailblazer. It also included offensive cyber-warfare capabilities, like injecting [[malware]] into remote computers. Congress criticized Turbulence in 2007 for having similar bureaucratic problems as Trailblazer.&lt;ref name=Bamford325&gt;Bamford, [[Shadow Factory]], pp. 325–340.&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be a realization of information processing at higher speeds in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/bal-nsa050607,0,1517618.story|title=Management shortcomings seen at NSA |author=Baltimore Sun|date=May 6, 2007|work=baltimoresun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global surveillance disclosures ===
{{Main|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|l2=|selfref=}}

The massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic, was revealed to the public in a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents beginning in June 2013. Most of the disclosures were leaked by former NSA contractor, [[Edward Snowden]].

== Mission ==
{{Global surveillance}}
NSA's [[eavesdropping]] mission includes radio broadcasting, both from various organizations and individuals, the Internet, telephone calls, and other intercepted forms of communication. Its secure communications mission includes military, diplomatic, and all other sensitive, confidential or secret government communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bamford, James|title=The Agency That Could Be Big Brother|date=December 25, 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/25bamford.html|work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2010 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "[e]very day, collection systems at the National Security Agency intercept and store 1.7&amp;nbsp;billion e-mails, phone calls and other types of communications. The NSA sorts a fraction of those into 70 separate databases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dana Priest, William Arkin|authorlink=Dana Priest|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/print/|title= A hidden world, growing beyond control]|work=[[The Washington Post]]''|date=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its listening task, NSA/CSS has been heavily involved in [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic]] research, continuing the work of predecessor agencies which had broken many World War II [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and [[cipher]]s (see, for instance, [[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple]], [[Venona project]], and [[JN-25]]).

In 2004, NSA [[Central Security Service]] and the [[National Cyber Security Division]] of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) agreed to expand NSA Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=National Security Agency and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Form New Partnership to Increase National Focus on Cyber Security Education|url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/press_room/2004/nsa_dhs_new_partnership.shtml|publisher=NSA Public and Media Affairs|accessdate=July 4, 2008| date=April 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[National Security Directive|National Security Presidential Directive]] 54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 (NSPD 54), signed on January 8, 2008, by President Bush, the NSA became the lead agency to monitor and protect all of the federal government's computer networks from [[cyber-terrorism]].&lt;ref name=Nakashima&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/25/AR2008012503261_pf.html|title=Bush Order Expands Network Monitoring: Intelligence Agencies to Track Intrusions|author=Ellen Nakashima|work=The Washington Post|date=January 26, 2008|accessdate=February 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
Operations by the National Security Agency can be divided in three types:
* Collection overseas, which falls under the responsibility of the Global Access Operations (GAO) division.
* Domestic collection, which falls under the responsibility of the [[Special Source Operations]] (SSO) division.
* Hacking operations, which falls under the responsibility of the [[Tailored Access Operations]] (TAO) division.

==== BoundlessInformant ====
[[Edward Snowden]] revealed in June 2013 that between February 8 and March 8, 2013, the NSA collected about 124.8&amp;nbsp;billion telephone data items and 97.1&amp;nbsp;billion computer data items throughout the world, as was displayed in charts from an internal NSA tool codenamed [[Boundless Informant]]. Initially, it was reported that some of these data reflected eavesdropping on citizens in countries like Germany, Spain and France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2013/10/21/france-in-the-nsa-s-crosshair-phone-networks-under-surveillance_3499741_651865.html France in the NSA's crosshair : phone networks under surveillance] Le Monde October 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; but later on, it became clear that those data were collected by European agencies during military missions abroad and were subsequently shared with NSA.

==== Software backdoors ====

[[Linus Torvalds]], the founder of [[Linux kernel]], joked during a [[LinuxCon]] keynote on September 18, 2013, that the NSA, who are the founder of [[SELinux]], wanted a backdoor in the kernel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/news/2013/09/techweekeurope-linus-torvalds-jokes-nsa-wanted-backdoor-linux|title=TechWeekEurope: Linus Torvalds Jokes The NSA Wanted A Backdoor In Linux |work=linuxfoundation.org|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916142701/http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/news/2013/09/techweekeurope-linus-torvalds-jokes-nsa-wanted-backdoor-linux|archivedate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later, Linus' father, a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP), revealed that the NSA actually did this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://falkvinge.net/2013/11/17/nsa-asked-linus-torvalds-to-install-backdoors-into-gnulinux/|title=NSA Asked Linus Torvalds To Install Backdoors Into GNU/Linux|work=falkvinge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|When my oldest son was asked the same question: "Has he been approached by the NSA about backdoors?" he said "No", but at the same time he nodded.

[[IBM Notes]] was the first widely adopted software product to use [[public key cryptography]] for client–server and server–server authentication and for encryption of data. Until US laws regulating encryption were changed in 2000, IBM and Lotus were prohibited from exporting versions of Notes that supported symmetric encryption keys that were longer than 40 bits. In 1997, Lotus negotiated an agreement with the NSA that allowed export of a version that supported stronger keys with 64 bits, but 24 of the bits were encrypted with a special key and included in the message to provide a "workload reduction factor" for the NSA. This strengthened the protection for users of Notes outside the US against private-sector [[industrial espionage]], but not against spying by the US government.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States|"The Swedes discover Lotus Notes has key escrow!"]] [[intelligence agency|The Risks Digest]], Volume 19, Issue 52, December 24, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[codebreaking|Only NSA can listen, so that's OK]] Heise, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Boomerang routing ====
While it is assumed that foreign transmissions terminating in the U.S. (such as a non-U.S. citizen accessing a U.S. website) subject non-U.S. citizens to NSA surveillance, recent research into boomerang routing has raised new concerns about the NSA's ability to surveil the domestic Internet traffic of foreign countries.&lt;ref name="boomerang" /&gt; Boomerang routing occurs when an Internet transmission that originates and terminates in a single country transits another. Research at the [[University of Toronto]] has suggested that approximately 25% of Canadian domestic traffic may be subject to NSA surveillance activities as a result of the boomerang routing of Canadian [[Internet service provider]]s.&lt;ref name="boomerang" /&gt;

==== Hardware implanting ====
{{Multiple image|image1 = NSA implanting station.jpg|image2 = NSA interception.jpg|caption1 = Intercepted packages are opened carefully by NSA employees|caption2 = A "load station" implanting a beacon}}

A document included in NSA files released with [[Glenn Greenwald]]'s book ''[[No Place to Hide (Greenwald book)|No Place to Hide]]'' details how the agency's [[Tailored Access Operations]] (TAO) and other NSA units gain access to hardware. They intercept [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Server (computing)|servers]] and other [[network hardware]] being shipped to organizations targeted for surveillance and install covert implant firmware onto them before they are delivered. This was described by an NSA manager as "some of the most productive operations in TAO because they preposition access points into hard target networks around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant|title=Photos of an NSA "upgrade" factory show Cisco router getting implant|last = Gallagher|first=Sean|date=May 14, 2014|publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) group implant catalog, after implanting Cottonmouth, the NSA can establish a [[Bridging (networking)|network bridge]] "that allows the NSA to load exploit software onto modified computers as well as allowing the NSA to relay commands and data between hardware and software implants."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/static/happ/netzwelt/2014/na/v1/pub/img/USB/S3223_COTTONMOUTH-I.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic collection ===
{{Further|Mass surveillance in the United States}}
NSA's mission, as set forth in [[Executive Order 12333]] in 1981, is to collect information that constitutes "foreign intelligence or counterintelligence" while ''not'' "acquiring information concerning the domestic activities of [[United States person]]s". NSA has declared that it relies on the FBI to collect information on foreign intelligence activities within the borders of the United States, while confining its own activities within the United States to the embassies and missions of foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/speeches_testimonies/2013_08_09_the_nsa_story.pdf nsa.gov: The NSA story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209113543/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/speeches_testimonies/2013_08_09_the_nsa_story.pdf |date=2014-12-09 }}, retrieved January 19, 2015 – Page 3: 'NSA ... will work with the FBI and other agencies to connect the dots between foreign-based actors and their activities in the U.S.'&lt;/ref&gt;

NSA's domestic surveillance activities are limited by the requirements imposed by the [[Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]. The [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] for example held in October 2011, citing multiple Supreme Court precedents, that the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures applies to the contents of all communications, whatever the means, because "a person's private communications are akin to personal papers."&lt;ref name="FiscPrivacyRuling2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/fisc_opinion_-_unconstitutional_surveillance_0.pdf|pages=73–74|date=October 3, 2011|author=John D Bates|title=[redacted]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these protections do not apply to non-U.S. persons located outside of U.S. borders, so the NSA's foreign surveillance efforts are subject to far fewer limitations under U.S. law.&lt;ref name="Jordan_David"&gt;David Alan Jordan.

==== President's Surveillance Program ====
[[George W. Bush]], president during the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]], approved the [[Patriot Act]] shortly after the attacks to take anti-terrorist security measures. [[Patriot Act, Title I|Title 1]], [[Patriot Act, Title II|2]], and [[Patriot Act, Title IX|9]] specifically authorized measures that would be taken by the NSA. These titles granted enhanced domestic security against terrorism, surveillance procedures, and improved intelligence, respectively. On March 10, 2004, there was a debate between President Bush and White House Counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]], Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]], and Acting Attorney General [[James Comey]]. The Attorneys General were unsure if the NSA's programs could be considered constitutional. They threatened to resign over the matter, but ultimately the NSA's programs continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=President George W. Bush's Influence Over Bureaucracy and Policy|last=Provost|first=Colin|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-60954-9|pages=94–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2004, President Bush signed a new authorization for mass surveillance of Internet records, in addition to the surveillance of phone records. This allowed the president to be able to override laws such as the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]], which protected civilians from mass surveillance. In addition to this, President Bush also signed that the measures of mass surveillance were also retroactively in place.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2015-09-20 /&gt;

=== Hacking operations ===
Besides the more traditional ways of eavesdropping in order to collect signals intelligence, NSA is also engaged in [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] computers, smartphones and their networks. These operations are conducted by the [[Tailored Access Operations]] (TAO) division, which has been active since at least circa 1998.&lt;ref name=fp2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aid|first=Matthew M.|title=Inside the NSA's Ultra-Secret China Hacking Group|journal=Foreign Policy|date=10 June 2013|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/06/10/inside-the-nsas-ultra-secret-china-hacking-group/|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine, "... the Office of Tailored Access Operations, or TAO, has successfully penetrated Chinese computer and telecommunications systems for almost 15 years, generating some of the best and most reliable intelligence information about what is going on inside the People's Republic of China."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.businessinsider.com/us-nsa-unit-tao-hacking-china-for-years-2013-6 U.S. NSA Unit 'TAO' Hacking China For Years]".

== Organizational structure ==
[[File:General Paul M. Nakasone (NSA).jpg|thumb|[[Paul M. Nakasone]], the director of the NSA.]]

The NSA is led by the [[Director of the National Security Agency]] (DIRNSA), who also serves as Chief of the [[Central Security Service]] (CHCSS) and Commander of the [[United States Cyber Command]] (USCYBERCOM) and is the highest-ranking military official of these organizations. He is assisted by a [[Deputy Director of the National Security Agency|Deputy Director]], who is the highest-ranking civilian within the NSA/CSS.

NSA also has an [[Inspector General]], head of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a [[General Counsel]], head of the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) and a Director of Compliance, who is head of the Office of the Director of Compliance (ODOC).&lt;ref&gt;These offices are for example mentioned in a [http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/PrimaryOrder_Collection_215.pdf FISA court order] from 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other intelligence organizations such as CIA or [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]], NSA has always been particularly reticent concerning its internal organizational structure.

As of the mid-1990s, the National Security Agency was organized into five Directorates:
* The Operations Directorate, which was responsible for SIGINT collection and processing.
* The Technology and Systems Directorate, which develops new technologies for SIGINT collection and processing.
* The Information Systems Security Directorate, which was responsible for NSA's communications and information security missions.
* The Plans, Policy and Programs Directorate, which provided staff support and general direction for the Agency.
* The Support Services Directorate, which provided logistical and administrative support activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/nsa/oldind.html |title=National Security Agency |publisher=fas.org |date= |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each of these directorates consisted of several groups or elements, designated by a letter. There were for example the A Group, which was responsible for all SIGINT operations against the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and G Group, which was responsible for SIGINT related to all non-communist countries. These groups were divided in units designated by an additional number, like unit A5 for breaking Soviet codes, and G6, being the office for the Middle East, North Africa, Cuba, Central and South America.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew M. Aid, The Secret Sentry, New York, 2009, pp. 130, 138, 156–158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the information about the historical structure of NSA that is archived at [https://fas.org/irp/nsa/oldind.html#organizations FAS.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Directorates ===
{{as of|2013}}, NSA has about a dozen directorates, which are designated by a letter, although not all of them are publicly known. The directorates are divided in divisions and units starting with the letter of the parent directorate, followed by a number for the division, the sub-unit or a sub-sub-unit.

The main elements of the organizational structure of the NSA are:&lt;ref&gt;TheWeek.com: [http://theweek.com/article/index/249658/the-nsas-secret-org-chart The NSA's secret org chart], September 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

* F – Directorate only known from unit F6, the [[Special Collection Service]] (SCS), which is a joint program created by CIA and NSA in 1978 to facilitate clandestine activities such as [[bugging]] computers throughout the world, using the expertise of both agencies.&lt;ref name=f6a&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/226723/inside-the-secret-world-of-americas-super-sophisticated-eavesdropping-spies|title=Inside the secret world of America's top eavesdropping spies|author=D.B.

* I – Information Assurance Directorate (IAD), which ensures availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation of national security and telecommunications and information systems (national security systems).
* J – Directorate only known from unit J2, the Cryptologic Intelligence Unit
* L – Installation and Logistics
* M – Human Resources
* Q – Security and Counterintelligence
* R – Research Directorate, which conducts research on signals intelligence and on information assurance for the U.S. Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA501547 National Intelligence – a consumer's guide] (PDF) 2009, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* S – [[Signals Intelligence Directorate]] (SID), which is responsible for the collection, analysis, production and dissemination of signals intelligence. This directorate is led by a director and a deputy director. The SID consists of the following divisions:
** S1 – Customer Relations
** S2 – Analysis and Production Centers, with the following so-called Product Lines:
*** S2A: South Asia, S2B: China and Korea, S2C: International Security, S2E: Middle East/Asia, S2F: International Crime, S2G: Counter-proliferation, S2H: Russia, S2I: Counter-terrorism, S2J: Weapons and Space, S2T: Current Threats
** S3 – Data Acquisition, with these divisions for the main collection programs:
*** S31 – Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES)
*** S32 – [[Office of Tailored Access Operations|Tailored Access Operations]] (TAO), which hacks into foreign computers to conduct cyber-espionage and reportedly is "the largest and arguably the most important component of the NSA's huge Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Directorate, consisting of over 1,000 military and civilian computer hackers, intelligence analysts, targeting specialists, computer hardware and software designers, and electrical engineers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aid |first=Matthew M. |title=Inside the NSA's Ultra-Secret China Hacking Group |journal=Foreign Policy |date=June 10, 2013 |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/06/10/inside_the_nsa_s_ultra_secret_china_hacking_group?page=0,0 |accessdate=June 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615011918/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/06/10/inside_the_nsa_s_ultra_secret_china_hacking_group?page=0%2C0 |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** S33 – Global Access Operations (GAO), which is responsible for intercepts from satellites and other international SIGINT platforms.&lt;ref name="theweek.com" /&gt; A tool which details and maps the information collected by this unit is code-named [[Boundless Informant]].
*** S34 – Collections Strategies and Requirements Center
*** S35 – [[Special Source Operations]] (SSO), which is responsible for domestic and compartmented collection programs, like for example the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] program.&lt;ref name="theweek.com"&gt;Marc Ambinder, [http://theweek.com/article/index/245408/how-a-single-it-tech-could-spy-on-the-world How a single IT tech could spy on the world], June 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Special Source Operations is also mentioned in connection to the [[Fairview (surveillance program)|FAIRVIEW]] collection program.&lt;ref&gt;The Special Source Operations logo can be seen on [http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2013/07/new-slides-about-nsa-collection-programs.html slides about the FAIRVIEW program].&lt;/ref&gt;
* T – Technical Directorate (TD)
* Directorate for Education and Training
* Directorate for Corporate Leadership
* Foreign Affairs Directorate, which acts as liaison with foreign intelligence services, counter-intelligence centers and the [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA]]-partners.
* Acquisitions and Procurement Directorate
* Information Sharing Services (ISS), led by a chief and a deputy chief.&lt;ref&gt;This is mentioned in a [http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/PrimaryOrder_Collection_215.pdf FISA court order] from 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, a leadership team was formed, consisting of the Director, the Deputy Director and the Directors of the Signals Intelligence (SID), the Information Assurance (IAD) and the Technical Directorate (TD). The chiefs of other main NSA divisions became associate directors of the senior leadership team.&lt;ref name=nsa60&gt;[https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf National Security Agency – 60 Years of Defending Our Nation], Anniversary booklet, 2012, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

After president George W. Bush initiated the [[President's Surveillance Program]] (PSP) in 2001, the NSA created a 24-hour Metadata Analysis Center (MAC), followed in 2004 by the Advanced Analysis Division (AAD), with the mission of analyzing content, Internet metadata and telephone metadata. Both units were part of the Signals Intelligence Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Ambinder, [http://theweek.com/article/index/246277/3008-selectors 3008 Selectors], June 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NSANet ===
[[File:Intel GreenDoor.jpg|thumb|''Behind the Green Door'' – Secure communications room with separate computer terminals for access to [[SIPRNET]], GWAN, [[NSANET]], and [[JWICS]]]]

The management of NSANet has been delegated to the [[Central Security Service]] Texas (CSSTEXAS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/67nww/publication/67nwwi33-1160/67nwwi33-1160.pdf Lackland Security Hill Enterprise Infrastructure and Computer Systems Management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204013239/http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/67nww/publication/67nwwi33-1160/67nwwi33-1160.pdf |date=2014-02-04 }}, October 1, 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

NSANet is a highly secured computer network consisting of fiber-optic and satellite communication channels which are almost completely separated from the public Internet. The network allows NSA personnel and civilian and military intelligence analysts anywhere in the world to have access to the agency's systems and databases. This access is tightly controlled and monitored. For example, every keystroke is logged, activities are audited at random and downloading and printing of documents from NSANet are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Ambinder, [http://theweek.com/article/index/245408/how-a-single-it-tech-could-spy-on-the-world How a single IT tech could spy on the world], June 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, NSANet, along with [[NIPRNET]] and [[SIPRNET]], had "significant problems with poor search capabilities, unorganized data and old information".&lt;ref name=nps2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/1998/Sep/98Sep_Misiewicz.pdf |title=Thesis; Modeling and Simulation of a Global Reachback Architecture ... |date=September 1998 |accessdate=April 13, 2011 |author=Misiewicz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812153842/http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/1998/Sep/98Sep_Misiewicz.pdf |archivedate=August 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the network was reported to have used over twenty [[commercial off-the-shelf]] operating systems.&lt;ref name=cmu1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/jarzombek.pdf|title=Systems, Network, and Information Integration Context for Software Assurance|author=Joe Jarzombek|year=2004|accessdate=April 13, 2011|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities that do highly sensitive research are allowed to connect to it.&lt;ref name=ps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exportcontrols.msu.edu/FBI_2010/Dr_Christopher_Griffin_Applied_Research_Laboratories_Penn_State_University_10_20_2010.pdf|title=Dealing with Sensitive Data at Penn State's Applied Research Laboratory: Approach and Examples|author= Christopher Griffin|year=2010|accessdate=April 13, 2011|publisher=msu.edu}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thousands of Top Secret internal NSA documents that were taken by [[Edward Snowden]] in 2013 were stored in "a file-sharing location on the NSA's intranet site"; so, they could easily be read online by NSA personnel. Everyone with a TS/SCI-clearance had access to these documents. As a system administrator, Snowden was responsible for moving accidentally misplaced highly sensitive documents to safer storage locations.&lt;ref&gt;NPR.org: [https://www.npr.org/2013/09/18/223523622/officials-edward-snowdens-leaks-were-masked-by-job-duties Officials: Edward Snowden's Leaks Were Masked By Job Duties], September 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Watch centers ===
The NSA maintains at least two watch centers:

* [[National Security Operations Center]] (NSOC), which is the NSA's current operations center and focal point for time-sensitive SIGINT reporting for the United States SIGINT System (USSS). This center was established in 1968 as the National SIGINT Watch Center (NSWC) and renamed into National SIGINT Operations Center (NSOC) in 1973. This "nerve center of the NSA" got its current name in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Top Level Telecommunications: [http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2012/12/pictures-at-nsas-60th-anniversary.html Pictures at the NSA's 60th anniversary]&lt;/ref&gt;
* NSA/CSS Threat Operations Center (NTOC), which is the primary NSA/CSS partner for [[Department of Homeland Security]] response to cyber incidents. The NTOC establishes real-time network awareness and threat characterization capabilities to forecast, alert, and attribute malicious activity and enable the coordination of Computer Network Operations. The NTOC was established in 2004 as a joint Information Assurance and Signals Intelligence project.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf National Security Agency – 60 Years of Defending Our Nation], Anniversary booklet, 2012, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employees ===
The number of NSA employees is officially classified&lt;ref name=Introv&gt;"[http://fcw.com/blogs/circuit/2012/04/fedsmc-chris-inglis-federal-workforce.aspx Introverted? Then NSA wants you.]" ''[[Florida Championship Wrestling]]''. April 2012. Retrieved July 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but there are several sources providing estimates.
In 1961, NSA had 59,000 military and civilian employees, which grew to 93,067 in 1969, of which 19,300 worked at the headquarters at Fort Meade. In the early 1980s NSA had roughly 50,000 military and civilian personnel. By 1989 this number had grown again to 75,000, of which 25,000 worked at the NSA headquarters. Between 1990 and 1995 the NSA's budget and workforce were cut by one third, which led to a substantial loss of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew M. Aid, The Secret Sentry, New York, 2009, pp. 128, 148, 190 and 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the NSA said more than 30,000 employees worked at Fort Meade and other facilities.&lt;ref name=60yearsp3 /&gt; In 2012, [[John C. Inglis]], the deputy director, said that the total number of NSA employees is "somewhere between 37,000 and one billion" as a joke,&lt;ref name=Introv /&gt; and stated that the agency is "probably the biggest employer of [[Extraversion and introversion|introverts]]."&lt;ref name=Introv /&gt; In 2013 ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' stated that the NSA had 40,000 employees.&lt;ref name="employees"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/prism-leak-inside-the-controversial-us-data-surveillance-program-a-904761.html |title=Prism Exposed: Data Surveillance with Global Implications |page=2 |publisher=Spiegel Online International |date=June 10, 2013}} "How can an intelligence agency, even one as large and well-staffed as the NSA with its 40,000 employees, work meaningfully with such a flood of information?"&lt;/ref&gt; More widely, it has been described as the world's largest single employer of [[mathematician]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |title=Statement for the Record |author=Harvey A.

As of 2013 about 1,000 [[system administrator]]s work for the NSA.&lt;ref name=DrewSengupta /&gt;

==== Personnel security ====
The NSA received criticism early on in 1960 after two agents had defected to the [[Soviet Union]]. Investigations by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and a special subcommittee of the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services]] revealed severe cases of ignorance in personnel security regulations, prompting the former personnel director and the director of security to step down and leading to the adoption of stricter security practices.&lt;ref name="Kahn"&gt;David Kahn, ''The Codebreakers'', Scribner Press, 1967, chapter 19, pp. 672–733.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, security breaches reoccurred only a year later when in an issue of ''[[Izvestia]]'' of July 23, 1963, a former NSA employee published several cryptologic secrets.

The very same day, an NSA clerk-messenger committed [[suicide]] as ongoing investigations disclosed that he had sold secret information to the Soviets on a regular basis. The reluctance of Congressional houses to look into these affairs had prompted a journalist to write, "If a similar series of tragic blunders occurred in any ordinary agency of Government an aroused public would insist that those responsible be officially censured, demoted, or fired." [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] criticized the NSA's tactics of concealing its doings as smug and the Congress' blind faith in the agency's right-doing as shortsighted, and pointed out the necessity of surveillance by the Congress to prevent abuse of power.&lt;ref name="Kahn" /&gt;

[[Edward Snowden]]'s leaking of the existence of [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] in 2013 caused the NSA to institute a "[[two-man rule]]", where two system administrators are required to be present when one accesses certain sensitive information.&lt;ref name=DrewSengupta&gt;{{cite news|author1=Drew, Christopher  |author2=Somini Sengupta |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/technology/nsa-leak-puts-focus-on-system-administrators.html|title=N.S.A.

===== Polygraphing =====
[[File:DOD polygraph brochure.pdf|thumb|[[Defense Security Service]] (DSS) polygraph brochure given to NSA applicants]]
The NSA conducts [[polygraph]] tests of employees. For new employees, the tests are meant to discover enemy spies who are applying to the NSA and to uncover any information that could make an applicant pliant to coercion.&lt;ref name=Bauer359&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBkEGAOlCDsC&amp;pg=PA359|author=Bauer, Craig P.|title=Secret History: The Story of Cryptology |publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-6186-1|year=2013|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the latter, historically ''EPQs'' or "embarrassing personal questions" about sexual behavior had been included in the NSA polygraph.&lt;ref name=Bauer359 /&gt; The NSA also conducts five-year periodic reinvestigation polygraphs of employees, focusing on counterintelligence programs. In addition the NSA conducts periodic polygraph investigations in order to find spies and leakers; those who refuse to take them may receive "termination of employment", according to a 1982 memorandum from the director of NSA.&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyp538&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James Bamford|Bamford]]|title=[[Body of Secrets]]|chapter=page 538 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqY4Wr3T5K4C&amp;pg=PA538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NSApolygraphvideo.webm|thumb|left|180px|NSA-produced video on the polygraph process]]
There are also "special access examination" polygraphs for employees who wish to work in highly sensitive areas, and those polygraphs cover counterintelligence questions and some questions about behavior.&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyp538 /&gt; NSA's brochure states that the average test length is between two and four hours.&lt;ref name=NSApolybrochure&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Polygraph Examination: An Important Appointment to Keep|url=https://www.nsa.gov/careers/_files/poly_brochure_final2.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=National Security Agency |accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1983 report of the [[Office of Technology Assessment]] stated that "It appears that the NSA [National Security Agency] (and possibly CIA) use the polygraph not to determine deception or truthfulness per se, but as a technique of interrogation to encourage admissions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McCarthy, Susan|title=The truth about the polygraph|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/03/02/polygraph/|publisher=''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes applicants in the polygraph process confess to committing felonies such as murder, rape, and selling of illegal drugs. Between 1974 and 1979, of the 20,511 job applicants who took polygraph tests, 695 (3.4%) confessed to previous felony crimes; almost all of those crimes had been undetected.&lt;ref name=Bauer359 /&gt;

==== Arbitrary firing ====
The number of exemptions from legal requirements has been criticized. When in 1964 the Congress was hearing a bill giving the director of the NSA the power to fire at will any employee,''The Washington Post'' wrote: "This is the very definition of arbitrariness. It means that an employee could be discharged and disgraced on the basis of anonymous allegations without the slightest opportunity to defend himself." Yet, the bill was accepted by an overwhelming majority.&lt;ref name="Kahn" /&gt; Also, every person hired to a job in the US after 2007, at any private organization, state or federal government agency, ''must'' be reported to the [[New Hire Registry]], ostensibly to look for [[child support]] evaders, ''except'' that employees of an intelligence agency may be excluded from reporting if the director deems it necessary for national security reasons.

==== History of headquarters ====
[[File:NSA-Fort Meade-1950.png|thumb|Headquarters at [[Fort Meade]] circa 1950s]]
When the agency was first established, its headquarters and cryptographic center were in the Naval Security Station in Washington, D.C.  The COMINT functions were located in [[Arlington Hall]] in [[Northern Virginia]], which served as the headquarters of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s cryptographic operations.&lt;ref name=60yearsp15&gt;{{cite web|title=60 Years of Defending Our Nation |publisher=National Security Agency|year=2012|format=PDF |url=https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf|accessdate=July 6, 2013|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the [[Soviet Union]] had detonated a nuclear bomb and because the facilities were crowded, the federal government wanted to move several agencies, including the AFSA/NSA. A planning committee considered [[Fort Knox]], but [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]], [[Maryland]], was ultimately chosen as NSA headquarters because it was far enough away from Washington, D.C. in case of a nuclear strike and was close enough so its employees would not have to move their families.&lt;ref name="60yearsp10" /&gt;

Construction of additional buildings began after the agency occupied buildings at Fort Meade in the late 1950s, which they soon outgrew.&lt;ref name=60yearsp10&gt;{{cite web|title=60 Years of Defending Our Nation|publisher=National Security Agency|year=2012|format=PDF|url=https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf|accessdate=July 6, 2013|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 the new headquarters building, nine stories tall, opened.

The main NSA headquarters and operations building is what [[James Bamford]], author of ''[[Body of Secrets]]'', describes as "a modern boxy structure" that appears similar to "any stylish office building."&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyofSecretsp488&gt;[[James Bamford|Bamford]], ''[[Body of Secrets]]: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=VqY4Wr3T5K4C&amp;pg=PA488 p. 488].

On August 6. 2006, ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' reported that the NSA had completely maxed out the grid, and that Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric (BGE, now [[Constellation Energy]]) was unable to sell them any more power.

The agency's European Cryptologic Center (ECC), with 240 employees in 2011, is headquartered at a US military compound in [[Griesheim (Hesse)|Griesheim]], near [[Frankfurt]] in Germany. A 2011 NSA report indicates that the ECC is responsible for the "largest analysis and productivity in Europe" and focuses on various priorities, including Africa, Europe, the Middle East and counterterrorism operations.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach and Holger Stark, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/germany-is-a-both-a-partner-to-and-a-target-of-nsa-surveillance-a-916029.html Ally and Target: US Intelligence Watches Germany Closely], August 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thailand ====
[[Thailand]] is a "3rd party partner" of the NSA along with nine other nations.&lt;ref name=Heise&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell |first1=Duncan|title=Paper 1: Echelon and its role in COMINT|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/7/7747/1.html|website=heise online |accessdate=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are non-English-speaking countries that have made security agreements for the exchange of SIGINT raw material and end product reports.

Thailand is the site of at least two US SIGINT collection stations. One is at the [[US Embassy]] in [[Bangkok]], a joint NSA-[[CIA]] Special Collection Service (SCS) unit. It presumably eavesdrops on foreign embassies, governmental communications, and other targets of opportunity.&lt;ref name=Electrospaces-2014-07-17&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA's global interception network |url=http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2013/12/nsas-global-interception-network.html|website=electrospaces.net|accessdate=March 11, 2015|date=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second installation is a FORNSAT (foreign satellite interception) station in the Thai city of [[Khon Kaen]]. It is codenamed INDRA, but has also been referred to as LEMONWOOD.&lt;ref name=Electrospaces-2014-07-17 /&gt; The station is approximately 40&amp;nbsp;ha (100 acres) in size and consists of a large 3,700–4,600 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (40,000–50,000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) operations building on the west side of the ops compound and four radome-enclosed parabolic antennas. Possibly two of the radome-enclosed antennas are used for SATCOM intercept and two antennas used for relaying the intercepted material back to NSA. There is also a PUSHER-type circularly-disposed antenna array (CDAA) array just north of the ops compound.&lt;ref name=MattAid&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA Satellite Communications SIGINT Station in Thailand Found|url=http://www.matthewaid.com/post/56608069320/nsa-satellite-communications-sigint-station-in |work=matthewaid.com/|accessdate=March 11, 2015|date=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No title |url=https://www.google.com/maps/@16.4755559,102.8442837,171m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en|website=Google Maps|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSA activated Khon Kaen in October 1979. Its mission was to eavesdrop on the radio traffic of Chinese army and air force units in southern China, especially in and around the city of [[Kunming]] in Yunnan Province. Back in the late 1970s the base consisted only of a small CDAA antenna array that was remote-controlled via satellite from the NSA listening post at [[Kunia, Hawaii]], and a small force of civilian contractors from Bendix Field Engineering Corp. whose job it was to keep the antenna array and satellite relay facilities up and running 24/7.&lt;ref name=MattAid /&gt;

According to the papers of the late General William Odom, the INDRA facility was upgraded in 1986 with a new British-made PUSHER CDAA antenna as part of an overall upgrade of NSA and Thai SIGINT facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.&lt;ref name=MattAid /&gt;

The base apparently fell into disrepair in the 1990s as China and Vietnam became more friendly towards the US, and by 2002 archived satellite imagery showed that the PUSHER CDAA antenna had been torn down, perhaps indicating that the base had been closed. At some point in the period since [[9/11]], the Khon Kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable SATCOM intercept mission. It is likely that the NSA presence at Khon Kaen is relatively small, and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors.&lt;ref name=MattAid /&gt;

== Research and development ==
NSA has been involved in debates about public policy, both indirectly as a behind-the-scenes adviser to other departments, and directly during and after [[Bobby Ray Inman|Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman]]'s directorship. NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the [[export of cryptography in the United States]]. Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996.

Its secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas, including the design of specialized communications [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software, production of dedicated [[semiconductor]]s (at the [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Ft. Meade]] chip fabrication plant), and advanced [[cryptography]] research. For 50 years, NSA designed and built most of its computer equipment in-house, but from the 1990s until about 2003 (when the U.S. Congress curtailed the practice), the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress curbs NSA's power to contract with suppliers|author=Sabar, Ariel|date=July 20, 2013|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-07-20/news/0307200276_1_nsa-eavesdropping-agency|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data Encryption Standard ===
{{Main|Data Encryption Standard}}
[[File:Frostburg.jpg|thumb|[[FROSTBURG]] was the NSA's first [[supercomputer]], used from 1991 to 1997]]

NSA was embroiled in some minor controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a standard and public [[block cipher]] [[algorithm]] used by the [[U.S. government]] and banking community. During the development of DES by [[IBM]] in the 1970s, NSA recommended changes to some details of the design. There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required, including speculation that a critical component—the so-called [[S-box]]es—had been altered to insert a "[[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]" and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power. It has since been observed that the S-boxes in DES are particularly resilient against [[differential cryptanalysis]], a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s but known to the IBM DES team.

=== Advanced Encryption Standard ===
{{Main|Advanced Encryption Standard}}
The involvement of NSA in selecting a successor to Data Encryption Standard (DES), the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), was limited to hardware performance testing (see [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|AES competition]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hardware Performance Simulations of Round 2 Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithms|author=Weeks, Bryan |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=June 29, 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSA has subsequently certified AES for protection of classified information when used in NSA-approved systems.&lt;ref name="suiteB"&gt;"the NIST standards that define Suite B..." in {{cite web|title=Suite B Cryptography / Cryptographic Interoperability|url=https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/|publisher=National Security Agency|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSA has specified [[NSA Suite A Cryptography|Suite A]] and [[NSA Suite B Cryptography|Suite B]] cryptographic algorithm suites to be used in U.S. government systems; the Suite B algorithms are a subset of those previously specified by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] and are expected to serve for most information protection purposes, while the Suite A algorithms are secret and are intended for especially high levels of protection.&lt;ref name="suiteB" /&gt;

=== SHA ===
The widely used [[SHA-1]] and [[SHA-2]] hash functions were designed by NSA. SHA-1 is a slight modification of the weaker [[SHA-0]] algorithm, also designed by NSA in 1993. This small modification was suggested by NSA two years later, with no justification other than the fact that it provides additional security. An attack for SHA-0 that does not apply to the revised algorithm was indeed found between 1998 and 2005 by academic cryptographers. Because of weaknesses and key length restrictions in SHA-1, NIST deprecates its use for [[digital signature]]s, and approves only the newer SHA-2 algorithms for such applications from 2013 on.&lt;ref&gt;Draft NIST SP 800-131, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new hash standard, [[SHA-3]], has recently been selected through the [[NIST hash function competition|competition]] concluded October 2, 2012 with the selection of [[SHA-3|Keccak]] as the algorithm. The process to select SHA-3 was similar to the one held in choosing the AES, but some doubts have been cast over it,&lt;ref name="cdt.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lorenzo |first=Joseph |url=https://www.cdt.org/blogs/joseph-lorenzo-hall/2409-nist-sha-3 |title=What the heck is going on with NIST's cryptographic standard, SHA-3? &amp;#124; Center for Democracy &amp; Technology |publisher=Cdt.org |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/marshray/status/380800393367674880 |title=Twitter / marshray: Believe it or not, NIST is |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; since fundamental modifications have been made to Keccak in order to turn it into a standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzRYQSHuuMYOQXdHWkRiZXlURVE/ |title=kelsey-invited-ches-0820.pdf – Google Drive |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes potentially undermine the cryptanalysis performed during the competition and reduce the security levels of the algorithm.&lt;ref name="cdt.org" /&gt;

=== Dual_EC_DRBG random number generator cryptotrojan ===
{{Main|Dual_EC_DRBG}}

NSA promoted the inclusion of a random number generator called [[Dual EC DRBG]] in the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'s 2007 guidelines. This led to speculation of a [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] which would allow NSA access to data encrypted by systems using that pseudo random number generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/11/securitymatters_1115|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CYqAu1fE?url=http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/11/securitymatters_1115 |archivedate=November 30, 2012 |title=Did NSA Put a Secret Backdoor in New Encryption Standard? |first=Bruce |last=Schneier |authorlink=Bruce Schneier|publisher=Wired News|date=November 15, 2007|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clipper chip ===
{{Main|Clipper chip}}
Because of concerns that widespread use of strong cryptography would hamper government use of [[Telephone tapping|wiretaps]], NSA proposed the concept of [[key escrow]] in 1993 and introduced the Clipper chip that would offer stronger protection than DES but would allow access to encrypted data by authorized law enforcement officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baker, Stewart A.|title= Don't Worry Be Happy |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.06/nsa.clipper_pr.html|journal=Wired|issue=2.06|accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was strongly opposed and key escrow requirements ultimately went nowhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Escrow, Key Recovery, Trusted Third Parties &amp; Govt.

=== Academic research ===
NSA has invested many millions of dollars in academic research under grant code prefix ''MDA904'', resulting in over 3,000 papers {{as of|2007|10|11|lc=y|df=US|post=.}} NSA/CSS has, at times, attempted to restrict the publication of academic research into cryptography; for example, the [[Khufu and Khafre]] block ciphers were voluntarily withheld in response to an NSA request to do so. In response to a [[Freedom of information in the United States|FOIA]] lawsuit, in 2013 the NSA released the 643-page research paper titled, "Untangling the Web: A Guide to Internet Research,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/Untangling_the_Web.pdf |title=Untangling the Web: A Guide to Internet Research |author1=Robyn Winder |author2=Charlie Speight |lastauthoramp=yes |work=National Security Agency Public Information |date=April 19, 2013 |accessdate=May 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509043240/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/Untangling_the_Web.pdf |archivedate=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; written and compiled by NSA employees to assist other NSA workers in searching for information of interest to the agency on the public Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/05/nsa-manual-on-hacking-internet/ |title=Use These Secret NSA Google Search Tips to Become Your Own Spy Agency|last=Zetter |first=Kim |work=Wired Magazine |date=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patents ===
NSA has the ability to file for a patent from the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] under [[gag order]]. Unlike normal patents, these are not revealed to the public and do not expire. However, if the Patent Office receives an application for an identical patent from a third party, they will reveal NSA's patent and officially grant it to NSA for the full term on that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schneier|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography, Second Edition|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=1996|pages=609–610|isbn=978-0-471-11709-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy and litigation ==
{{main|Mass surveillance in the United States}}
In the United States, at least since 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=dlj Echelon and the Legal Restraints on Signals Intelligence: A Need For Reevalualtion] by Lawrence D. Sloan on April 30, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; there has been legal controversy over what signal intelligence can be used for and how much freedom the National Security Agency has to use signal intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Edward C. et. al. (May 21, 2015) [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/R43459.pdf Overview of Constitutional Challenges to NSA Collection Activities]. Washington, DC: [[Congressional Research Service]].&lt;/ref&gt; The government has made, in 2015, slight changes in how it uses and collects certain types of data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/world/president-tweaks-the-rules-on-data-collection.html|title=Obama's changes to NSA data collection published on February 5, 2015, by Christina Murray quoting David E. Sanger of ''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically phone records.

=== Warrantless wiretaps ===
{{Main|NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)}}

On December 16, 2005, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that, under [[White House]] pressure and with an [[executive order]] from President [[George W. Bush]], the National Security Agency, in an attempt to thwart terrorism, had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country, without obtaining [[warrant (law)|warrants]] from the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]], a secret court created for that purpose under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA).&lt;ref name="NYTWarrantless"&gt;[[James Risen]] &amp; [[Eric Lichtblau]] (December 16, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

One such surveillance program, authorized by the U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 of President George Bush, was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U.S. Army 513th Military Intelligence Brigade. NSA relayed telephone (including cell phone) conversations obtained from ground, airborne, and satellite monitoring stations to various U.S. Army Signal Intelligence Officers, including the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion. Conversations of citizens of the U.S. were intercepted, along with those of other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB23/index2.html |title=Gwu.edu |publisher=Gwu.edu |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the surveillance program claim that the President has [[Unitary executive theory|executive authority]] to order such action, arguing that laws such as FISA are overridden by the President's Constitutional powers. In addition, some argued that FISA was implicitly overridden by a subsequent statute, the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]], although the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' deprecates this view. In the August 2006 case ''[[ACLU v. NSA]]'', [[U.S. District Court]] Judge [[Anna Diggs Taylor]] concluded that NSA's warrantless surveillance program was both illegal and unconstitutional. On July 6, 2007, the [[6th Circuit Court of Appeals]] vacated the decision on the grounds that the ACLU lacked standing to bring the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/nytimes/docs/nsa/aclunsa70607opn.pdf |title=6th Circuit Court of Appeals Decision |format=PDF |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053024/http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/nytimes/docs/nsa/aclunsa70607opn.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2006, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] filed a lawsuit, [[CCR v. Bush]], against the [[George W. Bush]] Presidency. The lawsuit challenged the National Security Agency's (NSA's) surveillance of people within the U.S., including the interception of CCR emails without securing a warrant first.&lt;ref name=TheJurist200705may21&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/05/ex-guantanamo-lawyers-sue-for.php |date=May 19, 2007 |title=Ex-Guantanamo lawyers sue for recordings of client meetings |author=Mike Rosen-Molina |publisher=[[The Jurist]] |accessdate=May 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502051556/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/05/ex-guantanamo-lawyers-sue-for.php |archivedate=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CcrVBushDocket&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/ccr-v.-bush |title=CCR v.

In September 2008, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) filed a [[class action]] lawsuit against the NSA and several high-ranking officials of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]],&lt;ref name=digjourn1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/260075|title=Jewel Vs.

As a result of the [[USA Freedom Act]] passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in June 2015, the NSA had to shut down its bulk phone surveillance program on November 29 of the same year. The USA Freedom Act forbids the NSA to collect metadata and content of phone calls unless it has a warrant for terrorism investigation. In that case the agency has to ask the [[Telephone company|telecom companies]] for the record, which will only be kept for six months.

In May 2008, [[Mark Klein]], a former [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]] employee, alleged that his company had cooperated with NSA in installing [[Narus (company)|Narus]] hardware to replace the FBI [[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]] program, to monitor network communications including traffic between U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name="mark"&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 16, 2007|title=For Your Eyes Only?|journal=[[NOW On PBS|NOW]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/307/index.html}} on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data mining ===
NSA was reported in 2008 to use its computing capability to analyze "transactional" data that it regularly acquires from other government agencies, which gather it under their own jurisdictional authorities. As part of this effort, NSA now monitors huge volumes of records of domestic email data, web addresses from Internet searches, bank transfers, credit-card transactions, travel records, and telephone data, according to current and former intelligence officials interviewed by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. The sender, recipient, and subject line of emails can be included, but the content of the messages or of phone calls are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120511973377523845 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124141023/http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB120511973377523845.html |archivedate=January 24, 2009 |title=NSA's Domestic Spying Grows As Agency Sweeps Up Data |first=Siobahn|last=Gorman|publisher=The Wall Street Journal Online|date=March 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illegally obtained evidence ===
{{Further|Parallel construction#Parallel construction in the United States Drug Enforcement Administration}}
In August 2013 it was revealed that a 2005 IRS training document showed that NSA intelligence intercepts and wiretaps, both foreign and domestic, were being supplied to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) and [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and were illegally used to launch criminal investigations of US citizens. Law enforcement agents were directed to conceal how the investigations began and recreate an apparently legal investigative trail by re-obtaining the same evidence by other means.&lt;ref&gt;John Shiffman and Kristina Cooke (August 5, 2013) ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805 Exclusive: U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans]''.

In the months leading to April 2009, the NSA intercepted the communications of U.S. citizens, including a Congressman, although the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] believed that the interception was unintentional.

=== Section 215 metadata collection ===
On April 25, 2013, the NSA obtained a court order requiring [[Verizon]]'s Business Network Services to provide metadata on all calls in its system to the NSA "on an ongoing daily basis" for a three-month period, as reported by ''[[The Guardian]]'' on June 6, 2013. This information includes "the numbers of both parties on a call&amp;nbsp;... location data, call duration, unique identifiers, and the time and duration of all calls" but not "[t]he contents of the conversation itself". The order relies on the so-called "business records" provision of the Patriot Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Glenn Greenwald]] |title=Revealed: NSA collecting phone records of millions of Americans daily|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order |accessdate=June 6, 2013|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes2013-06-05 /&gt;

In August 2013, following the Snowden leaks, new details about the NSA's data mining activity were revealed. Reportedly, the majority of emails into or out of the United States are captured at "selected communications links" and automatically analyzed for keywords or other "selectors". Emails that do not match are deleted.&lt;ref name="SavageBroaderSifting"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/us/broader-sifting-of-data-abroad-is-seen-by-nsa.html |title=N.S.A.

The utility of such a massive metadata collection in preventing terrorist attacks is disputed. Many studies reveal the dragnet like system to be ineffective. One such report, released by the [[New America Foundation]] concluded that after an analysis of 225 terrorism cases, the NSA  "had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost2014"&gt;Nakashima, Ellen. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-phone-record-collection-does-little-to-prevent-terrorist-attacks-group-says/2014/01/12/8aa860aa-77dd-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html/ "NSA phone record collection does little to prevent terrorist attacks, group says"], ''The Washington Post'', January 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of the program said that while metadata alone can't provide all the information necessary to prevent an attack, it assures the ability to "connect the dots"&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;Nakashima, Ellen. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-chief-defends-collecting-americans-data/2013/09/25/5db2583c-25f1-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html / "NSA chief defends collecting Americans' data"], ''The Washington Post'', September 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; between suspect foreign numbers and domestic numbers with a speed only the NSA's software is capable of. One benefit of this is quickly being able to determine the difference between suspicious activity and real threats.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} As an example, NSA director General [[Keith B. Alexander]] mentioned at the annual Cybersecurity Summit in 2013, that metadata analysis of domestic phone call records after the [[Boston Marathon bombing]] helped determine that rumors of a follow-up attack in New York were baseless.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com" /&gt;

In addition to doubts about its effectiveness, many people argue that the collection of metadata is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. {{As of|2015}}, the collection process remains legal and grounded in the ruling from Smith v. Maryland (1979). A prominent opponent of the data collection and its legality is U.S. District Judge [[Richard J.

=== Responsibility for international ransomware attack ===
An exploit, [[EternalBlue]], which is believed to have been created by the NSA, was used in the unprecedented worldwide [[WannaCry ransomware attack]] in May 2017.

A number of experts have pointed the finger at the NSA's non-disclosure of the underlying vulnerability, and their loss of control over the EternalBlue attack tool that exploited it.

An '''Offshore Financial Centre''' or '''OFC''' is defined as a ''country or jurisdiction that provides financial services to nonresidents on a scale that is incommensurate with the size and the financing of its domestic economy''.{{efn|This is the IMF 2007 definition, however, it is almost identical to the general academic definition, and the other FSF–IMF–definitions of an OFC, see {{slink|#Definitions}}.}}&lt;ref name="imf"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2007/wp0787.pdf|title=Concept of Offshore Financial Centers: In Search of an Operational Definition|author=Ahmed Zoromé|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|quote=IMF Working Paper 07/87|date=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   "Offshore" does not refer to the location of the OFC (many [[Financial Stability Forum|FSF]]–[[IMF]] OFCs, such as Luxembourg and Hong Kong, are located "onshore"), but to the fact that the largest users of the OFC are nonresident (e.g. they are "offshore").{{efn|It is common to see lists of "Offshore Financial Centres" that are a subset of the [[Financial Stability Forum|FSF]]–[[IMF]] OFC list, restricted to the locations that are small islands (e.g. Jersey, Bermuda, Gurnsey etc.)}} The IMF lists OFCs as a third class of [[financial centre]], with International Financial Centres (IFCs), and Regional Financial Centres (RFCs); there is overlap (e.g. Singapore is an RFC and an OFC).

[[File:Ugland_House.jpg|thumb|[[Ugland House]], the Cayman Islands.  The Caribbean, including the Caymans, the British Virgin Islands and Bermuda, has several major Sink OFCs, is the 2nd largest global tax haven (in aggregate),&lt;ref name="z1"/&gt; and largest OFC shadow banking centre.&lt;ref name="shadow"/&gt;]]

During April–June 2000, the [[Financial Stability Forum|FSF]]–[[IMF]] produced the first list of 42–46 OFCs using a qualitative approach.  In April 2007, the IMF produced a revised quantitative-based list of 22 OFCs,{{efn|name=IMF2007}} and in June 2018, another revised quantitative-based list of 8 major OFCs, who are responsible for 85% of OFC financial flows (which includes, Ireland, the Caribbean,{{efn|Mainly the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and the British Virgin Islands}} Luxembourg, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Netherlands).&lt;ref name="imfx"/&gt;  The removal of currency and capital controls, the early driver for the creation and use of many OFCs in the 1960s and 1970s,{{efn|name=ofcx}} saw taxation and/or regulatory regimes become the main reasons for using OFCs from the 1980s.&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt; Progress from 2000 onwards from [[IMF]]–[[OECD]]–[[Financial Action Task Force|FATF]] initiatives on common standards, regulatory compliance, and banking transparency, has significantly weakened the regulatory attraction of OFCs. Academics now consider the activities of OFCs to be synonymous with [[tax havens]],&lt;ref name="missing profits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="imfx"/&gt;  with a particular focus on corporate tax planning [[BEPS]] tools, tax-neutral{{efn|name=tax|''Ta-neutral'' is a term that OFCs use to describe legal structures where the OFC does not levy any taxes, duties or VAT on fund flows into, during, or exiting (e.g. no withholding taxes) the vehicle.  Major examples being the Irish [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)]], and the Cayman Islands SPC.}} asset structuring vehicles, and [[shadow banking]]/asset [[securitization]].

[[File:Spuerkeess headquarters 2012-04.JPG|thumb|[[Banque et Caisse d'Épargne de l'État|Spuerkeess Bank HQ]], Luxembourg.  Luxembourg is the 2nd largest Sink OFC, the 6th largest global tax haven,&lt;ref name="z1"/&gt; and the 2nd largest OFC shadow banking centre.&lt;ref name="shadow"/&gt;]]

Research in 2013–14, showed OFCs harboured 8–10% of global wealth in tax-neutral structures, and act as hubs for U.S. multinationals, in particular, to avoid corporate taxes via [[base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") tools (e.g. the [[double Irish]]).  A study in July 2017, [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]], split the understanding of an OFC into 24 Sink OFCs (e.g. traditional [[tax haven]]s, to which a disproportionate amount of value disappears from the economic system), and 5 Conduit OFCs (e.g. modern [[corporate tax haven]]s, through which a disproportionate amount of value moves toward the Sink OFCs).  In June 2018, research showed that OFCs had become the dominant locations for corporate tax avoidance BEPS schemes, costing USD 200 billion in lost annual tax revenues.  A June 2018 joint-IMF study showed much of the [[Foreign Direct Investment|FDI]] from OFCs, into higher-tax countries, originated from higher-tax countries (e.g. the U.K. is the largest investor in itself, via OFCs).&lt;ref name="imfx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quartz"/&gt;

[[File:Beursplein5 frontwholebuilding.JPG|thumb|[[Euronext Amsterdam|Dutch Stock Exchange]], Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Netherlands is the largest global Conduit OFC, and is  the 5th largest global tax haven, and is the 4th largest shadow banking OFC.&lt;ref name="z1"/&gt;]]

===Core definition===

The definition of an ''offshore financial centre'' dates back to academic papers by Dufry &amp; McGiddy (1978), and McCarthy (1979) regarding locations that are: ''Cities, areas or countries which have made a conscious effort to attract offshore banking business, i.e., non-resident foreign currency denominated business, by allowing relatively free entry and by adopting a flexible attitude where taxes, levies and regulation are concerned.”'' An April 2007 review of the historical definition of an OFC by the IMF, summarised the 1978–2000 academic work regarding the attributes that define an OFC, into the following four main attributes, which still remain relevant:&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt; 
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
|Primary orientation towards non-residents;
|Favourable regulatory environment;
|Low or zero-taxation scheme;
|Disproportion between the size of the financial sector and the domestic financing needs.
}}

In April 2000, the term rose to prominence when the [[Financial Stability Forum]] ("FSF"), concerned about OFCs on global financial stability, produced a report listing 42 OFCs.&lt;ref name="FSF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_0004b.pdf?page_moved=1|title=Report from the Working Group on Offshore Centres|publisher=[[Financial Stability Forum]]|date=5 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FSF used a qualitative approach to defining OFCs, noting that: ''Offshore financial centres (OFCs) are not easily defined, but they can be characterised as jurisdictions that attract a high level of non-resident activity [...] and volumes of non-resident business substantially exceeds the volume of domestic business.''&lt;ref name="FSF"/&gt;

In June 2000, the IMF accepted the FSF's recommendation to investigate the impact of OFCs on global financial stability.  On the 23 June 2000, the IMF published a working paper on OFCs which expanded the FSF list to 46 OFCs, but split into three Groups based on the level of co-operation and adherence to international standards by the OFC.&lt;ref name="IMFJune2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/mae/oshore/2000/eng/back.htm|title=Offshore Financial Centers: IMF Background Paper|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=23 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IMF paper categorised OFCs as a third type of [[financial centre]], and listed them in order of importance: International Financial Centre ("IFC"), Regional Financial Centres ("RFC") and Offshore Financial Centres ("OFC"); and gave a definition of an OFC:

{{quote|A more practical definition of an OFC is a center where the bulk of financial sector activity is offshore on both sides of the balance sheet, (that is the counterparties of the majority of financial institutions liabilities and assets are non-residents), where the transactions are initiated elsewhere, and where the majority of the institutions involved are controlled by non-residents|source=IMF Background Paper: Offshore Financial Centres (June 2000)&lt;ref name="IMFJune2000"/&gt;}} 

The June 2000 IMF paper then listed three major attributes of offshore financial centres:&lt;ref name="IMFJune2000"/&gt;
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
| Jurisdictions that have relatively large numbers of financial institutions engaged primarily in business with non-residents; and
| Financial systems with external assets and liabilities out of proportion to domestic financial intermediation designed to finance domestic economies; and
| More popularly, centers which provide some of the following services: low or zero taxation; moderate or light financial regulation; banking secrecy and anonymity.
}}

A subsequent April 2007 IMF on OFCs, established a quantitative approach to defining OFCs which the paper stated was captured by the following definition:&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt; 

{{quote|An OFC is a country or jurisdiction that provides financial services to nonresidents on a scale that is incommensurate with the size and the financing of its domestic economy.|source=IMF Working Paper: Concept of Offshore Financial Centers: In Search of an Operational Definition (April 2007)&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt; }} 

The April 2007 IMF paper used a quantitative ''proxy text'' for the above definition: ''More specifically, it can be considered that the ratio of net financial services exports to GDP could be an indicator of the OFC status of a country or jurisdiction''.  This approach produced a revised list of 22 OFCs,{{efn|name=IMF2007|The 104 jurisdictions in the IMF's 2007 quantitative study sample, did not include several of those in the IMF–FSF 2000 lists that are generally recognised as tax havens or OFCs, such as Andorra, the British Virgin Islands, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Montserrat, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This may be remedied if more countries begin to collect and supply relevant data, needed in the quantitative study, which is being attempted through the IMF’s Information Framework Initiative}} however, the list had a strong correlation with the original list of 46 OFCs from the IMF's June 2000 paper.&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt; The revised list was much shorter than the original IMF list as it only focused on OFCs where the national economic accounts produced breakdowns of net financial services exports data.

By September 2007, the definition of an OFC from the most cited academic paper on OFCs,&lt;ref name="respec"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch?form=extended&amp;wm=wrd&amp;dt=range&amp;ul=&amp;q=tax+haven&amp;cmd=Search%21&amp;wf=4BFF&amp;s=C&amp;db=&amp;de=|title=IDEAS/RePEc Database|quote=Offshore Financial Centres by Most Cited}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed a strong correlation with the FSF–IMF definitions of an OFC:&lt;ref name="RoseSpiegel"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w12044.pdf|title=Offshore Financial Centers: Parasites or Symbionts?|author1=Andrew K.

The common FSF–IMF–Academic definition of an OFC focused on the ''outcome'' of non-resident activity in a location (e.g. financial flows that are disproportionate to the indigenous economy), and not on the reason that non-residents decide to conduct financial activity in a location.  However, since the early academic papers into OFCs in the late 1970s, and the FSF-IMF investigations, it has been consistently noted that tax planning is one of the prime drivers of OFC activity.  The other most commonly noted prime driver is favorable regulation, or regulatory arbitrage, such as in OFCs like Liberia, that focus on shipping.

In April–June 2000, when the FSF–IMF produced their lists of OFCs, ''tax justice'' campaigners highlighted their similarity with [[tax haven]] lists.&lt;ref name="TJN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Identifying_Tax_Havens_Jul_07.pdf |title=Identifying Tax Havens and Offshore Finance Centres|quote=Various attempts have been made to identify and list tax havens and offshore finance centres (OFCs).

The reduction in ''banking secrecy'' as a result of these projects, led the leading academics who study tax havens and OFCs, to conclude that by 2010 onwards, the term tax haven and the term OFC had become practically synonymous:

While from 2010 onwards, academics began to treat tax havens and OFCs as practically synonymous, the OECD and the EU went in a different direction.  By 2017, the OECD's list of tax havens only contained Trinidad &amp; Tobago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ft.com/content/94d84054-5bf0-11e7-b553-e2df1b0c3220|title=Trinidad &amp; Tobago left as the last blacklisted tax haven|publisher=Financial Times|quote=Alex Cobham of the [[Tax Justice Network]] said: It’s disheartening to see the OECD fall back into the old pattern of creating ‘tax haven’ blacklists on the basis of criteria that are so weak as to be near enough meaningless, and then declaring success when the list is empty.” |date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the EU's 2017 "blacklist" of 17 tax havens, only contained one jurisdiction, Samoa, in the [[Tax haven#Top 20 tax havens|top 20 tax havens]], as ranked by academics and non-governmental organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c4d721dc-d9cf-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482|title=EU puts 17 countries on tax haven blacklist|quote=EU members were not screened but Oxfam said that if the criteria were applied to publicly available information the list should feature 35 countries including EU members Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Malta | publisher = Financial Times|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the [[University of Amsterdam]]'s CORPNET group ignored any definition of a tax haven and followed a quantitive approach, analyzing 98 million global corporate connections on the [[Bureau van Dijk|Orbis database]].&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt; CORPNET used a variation of the technique in the IMF's 2007 OFC working paper,&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt; and ranked the jurisdictions by the scale of international corporate connections relative to the connections from the indigenous economy.  In addition, CORPNET split the resulting OFCs into jurisdictions that acted like a ''terminus'' for corporate connections (a Sink), and jurisdictions that acted like ''nodes'' for corporate connections (a Conduit).

CORPNET's [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]] study split the understanding of an offshore financial centre into two classifications:&lt;ref name="xx"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Javier Garcia-Bernardo|author2=Jan Fichtner|author3=Frank W. Takes|author4=Eelke M. Heemskerk | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06322-9 | volume=7 | issue=6246 | title=Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network | journal=[[Scientific Reports]], [[Nature Publishing Group]] | date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  24 Sink OFCs: jurisdictions in which a disproportionate amount of value disappears from the economic system (e.g. the traditional [[tax havens]]).
*  5 Conduit OFCs: jurisdictions through which a disproportionate amount of value moves toward sink OFCs (e.g. the modern [[corporate tax haven]]s)&lt;br&gt;(Conduits are: Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Singapore and Ireland)

Sink OFCs rely on Conduit OFCs to reroute funds from high-tax locations using the BEPS tools which are encoded, and accepted, in the Conduit OFC's extensive networks of bilateral [[tax treaties]].  Because Sink OFCs are more closely associated with traditional tax havens, they tend to have more limited treaty networks.

CORPNET's lists of top five [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Conduit OFC|Conduit OFCs]], and top five [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Sink OFC|Sink OFCs]], matched 9 of the top 10 havens in the [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines 2010 list|Hines 2010 tax haven list]], only differing in the United Kingdom, which only [[Corporate haven#U.K. transformation|transformed their tax code in 2009–12]], from a "worldwide" corporate tax system, to a "territorial" corporate tax system.

In a similar method to the various IMF lists, the FSF produces a table of the locations with the highest concentration of OFI/shadow banking financial assets, versus domestic GDP, in its 2018 report, thus creating a ranked table of "Shadow Banking OFCs".&lt;ref name="FSF1"/&gt;  The fuller table is produced in the {{slink|#Shadow banking}} section, however, the 4 largest OFCs for shadow banking with OFI assets over 5x GDP are:&lt;ref name="FSF1"/&gt;

==Regulatory clampdown==
[[File:HMRC offshore evasion poster February 2014.jpg|thumb|[[HM Revenue and Customs]] offshore evasion poster, February 2014]]

Offshore finance became the subject of increased attention since the FSF–IMF reports on OFC in 2000, and also from the April 2009 G20 meeting, during the height of the financial crisis,  when heads of state resolved to "take action" against non-cooperative jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110104192515/http://www.g20.org/Documents/final-communique.pdf G20 Communiqué]. g20.org. 2 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Initiatives spearheaded by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) and the [[International Monetary Fund]] have had an effect on curbing some excesses in the offshore financial centre industry, although it would drive the OFC industry towards a {{slink|#Focus on tax}} for institutional and corporate clients. The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work [http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019 supports] increased government efforts to curb tax avoidance.

{{ordered list|type=lower-roman

|Money laundering. In 2000 the FATF began a policy of assessing the cooperation of all countries in programmes against [[money laundering]]. Considerable tightening up of both regulation and implementation was noted by the FATF over subsequent years (see generally [[FATF Blacklist]]). Most of the principal OFCs strengthened their internal regulations relating to money laundering and criminal financial activities.

|Tax avoidance. Similarly, in 2000 the OECD began a policy of forcing greater compliance by traditional tax havens by increasing the requirements for data sharing and transparency to avoid being included on the OECD's tax haven blacklist. While objections from the U.S. limited the OECD's effect on tax havens, the increased information disclosure enabled tax academics to use more quantitative methods for identifying tax avoidance.&lt;ref name="crs2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/R40114.pdf|title=The OECD Initiative on Tax Havens|date=11 March 2010|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|author=James K. Jackson|page=7|quote=As a result of the Bush Administration’s efforts, the OECD backed away from its efforts to target “harmful tax practices” and shifted the scope of its efforts to improving exchanges of tax information between member countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Financial and banking secrecy. The April 2000 FSF OFC report, which launched the June 2000 IMF OFC initiative, led to a process of increased data disclosure and financial reporting by financial institutions in OFCs.  It also led to more specific clampdowns in the area of ''bank secrecy'', over which the IMF have greater control, and which ultimately removed much of the main distinctions between historical definitions of OFCs and tax havens.&lt;ref name="zucbank"/&gt;

Early research on offshore financial centers, from 1978–2000, identified reasons for nonresidents using an OFC, over the financial system in their own home jurisdiction (which in most cases was more developed than the OFC).  Prominent reasons in these lists were:&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt;  

{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
|Low taxation (Dufey and Giddy (1978); McCarthy (1979); Johnston (1982); Park (1994); Errico and Musalem (1999))
|Favourable regulations (Dufey and Giddy (1978); McCarthy (1979); Johnston (1982); Errico and Musalem (1999))
|Manage around currency and capital controls{{efn|name=ofcx|This is a complex area and is considered core to the original development of OFCs back in the 1960s and 1970s, and their role in the Eurodollar and Eurobond markets and other such "offshored" capital markets reliant on "international" pools of capital,&lt;ref name="eurodollar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/07/the-real-goldfinger-the-london-banker-who-broke-the-world|title=The real Goldfinger: the London banker who broke the world|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} (Johnston (1982); Park (1994); IMF (1995); Hampton (1996))
}}

The third reason, ''Manage around currency and capital controls'', dissipated with globalisation of financial markets and free-floating exchange rate mechanisms, and ceases to appear in research after 2000.  The second reason, ''Favourable regulations'', had also dissipated, but to a lesser degree, as a result of initiatives by the IMF–OECD–FATF post–2000, promoting common standards and regulatory compliance across OFCs and tax havens.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zucbank"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/docs/zucman-gabriel/revised_october12.pdf|title=THE END OF BANK SECRECY?

In Q1 2015, Apple executed the largest BEPS transaction in history, moving USD 300 billion in [[intellectual property]] ("IP") assets to Ireland, an IMF OFC, to use the Irish "[[Ireland as a tax haven#Green Jersey|Green Jersey]]" BEPS tool (see "[[Leprechaun economics]]").  In August 2016, the [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|EU Commission levied the largest tax fine in history, at USD 13 billion, against Apple in Ireland]] for abuse of the [[double Irish]] BEPS tool from 2004–2014.

In June 2018, another joint-IMF study showed that 8 ''pass-through economies'', namely, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong SAR, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Singapore; host more than 85 per cent of the world’s investment in special purpose entities, which are often set up for tax reasons.&lt;ref name="imfx"/&gt;

==Shadow banking and securitisation==

[[File:Credit Suisse - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|[[Banking in Switzerland#Banking secrecy|Banking secrecy]] in Switzerland is federally protected by the [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks|Banking Law of 1934]]. ]]

===Shadow banking===

Research into OFCs highlighted [[shadow banking]] as an original service of OFCs.&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt;  Shadow banking enabled the pools of ''offshore'' capital, mostly dollars, that had escaped capital controls in the 1960s and 1970s, and thus the main ''onshore'' banking systems, to be recycled back into the economic system while paying interest to the capital's owner, thus encouraging them to keep their capital offshore.  They highlight the Eurodollar capital market as particularly important.&lt;ref name="eurodollar"/&gt; However, as OFCs developed in the 1980s, it became apparent that OFC banks were not just recycling Eurodollars from foreign corporate transactions, but also capital from tax avoidance (e.g. money being hidden in tax havens), and also from other criminal and illegal sources.&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt;  Many OFCs, such as Switzerland, had banking secrecy laws protecting the identity of the owners of the ''offshore'' capital in the OFC.  Over the years, a {{slink|#Regulatory clampdown}} has weakened the ability for OFCs to provide bank secrecy.  Shadow banking, however, remains a key part of OFCs services, and the [[Financial Stability Forum]] list of major shadow banking locations are all recognized OFCs.&lt;ref name="FSF1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P050318-1.pdf|title=Global Shadow Banking and Monitoring Report: 2017|date=5 March 2018|quote=Jurisdictions with the largest financial systems relative to GDP (Exhibit 2-3) tend to have relatively larger OFI [or Shadown Banking] sectors: Luxembourg (at 92% of total financial assets), the Cayman Islands (85%), Ireland (76%) and the Netherlands (58%)|page=30|publisher=[[Financial Stability Forum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Securitisation===

{{see also|Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)}}

OFCs, however, have expanded into a related area to shadow banking, which is asset [[securitisation]].  Unlike traditional shadow banking, where the OFC bank needs to access a pool of ''offshore capital'' to operate, securitisation involves no provision of capital.  OFC securitisation involves the provision of legal structures, registered in the OFC, into which foreign capital is placed to finance foreign assets (e.g. aircraft, ships, mortgages assets etc.), used by foreign operators and foreign investors.  The OFC thus behaves more like a ''legal conduit'' rather than providing actual banking services.  This has seen a rise in large specialist legal and accounting firms, who provide the legal structures for securitisations, in OFC locations.  In normal securitisations, the foreign capital, assets and operators can all come from major ''onshore'' locations.  For example, Deutsche Bank in Germany might lend Euro 5 billion into an Irish Section 110 SPV (the Irish securitisation legal structure), which then buys Euro 5 billion in aircraft engines from Boeing, and then leases the engines to Delta Airlines.  The reason why Deutsche Bank would use an Irish Section 110 SPV is that it is tax neutral,{{efn|name=tax}} and that it has certain legal features, particularly [[Orphan structure|orphaning]], which are helpful to Deutsche Bank, but which are not available in Germany.  Orphaning poses considerable risks of tax abuse and tax avoidance to the tax base of higher-tax jurisdictions; even Ireland discovered a major domestic tax avoidance scheme in 2016, by U.S. distressed debt funds, using the [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Vulture fund tax avoidance|Irish Section 110 SPVs]], on Irish domestic investments.

==Defences of OFCs==

===Better regulations===

OFCs sometimes market themselves as ''leaders in regulation'' operating under the highest standards with the most advanced legal systems.  Because OFCs are willing to create legal structures for broad classes of assets, including [[intellectual property]] ("IP") assets, cryptocurrency assets, and carbon credit assets, there is a justification that OFCs are often at the forefront of certain types of regulation.  However, in the area of more general regulation, there is little real evidence to support these claims.  In addition, there are contrary examples, even from the biggest OFCs, of poor regulation and oversight. (see [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Unregulated shadow banking|here]]).

Supporters of OFCs also claim that the costs of regulation and operation in OFCs are lower than in the major [[financial centres]] due to scale effects and cheaper operating locations.  However, there have been no credible studies or evidence put forward, as yet, to demonstrate that it is cheaper to operate from OFCs than major IFCs/RFCs.  There is evidence that OFCs have faster approval times, even 24 hours, for approval of new legal structures and [[special purpose vehicles]], however critics highlight this aspect as a sign of weaker regulation and oversight in OFCs (e.g. [[brass plate company]]).

===Securitisation transactions===

{{see also|Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)}}

One of the most important service lines for OFCs is in providing legal structures for global [[securitisation]] transactions for all types of asset classes, including aircraft finance, shipping finance, equipment finance, and collateralised loan vehicles.  OFCs provide what are called ''tax neutral'' [[special purpose vehicles]] ("SPVs") where no taxes, VAT, levies or duties are taken by the OFC on the SPV.  In addition, aggressive legal structuring, including [[Orphan structures]], is facilitated to support requirements for [[Bankruptcy remote]]ness, which would not be allowed in larger [[financial centres]], as it could damage the local tax base, but are needed by banks in securitisations.  As the ''effective'' tax rate in most OFCs is near zero (e.g. they are really tax havens), this is a lower risk, although, the experience of U.S. distressed debt funds abusing [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Vulture fund tax avoidance|Irish Section 110 SPVs]] in 2012–2016 is notable.  However, OFCs play a key role in providing the legal structure for global securitisation transactions that could not be performed from the main [[financial centres]].

===Promotion of growth===

The most controversial claim is that OFCs promote global economic growth by providing a preferred platform, even if due to tax avoidance or regulatory arbitrage reasons, from which global capital is more readily deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Leonid |last = Bershidsky|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-07-25/fighting-corporate-tax-avoidance-can-kill-economic-growth|title=Fighting tax dodgers can kill economic growth|publisher=Bloomberg|date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are strong academic advocates, and studies, on both sides of this argument.  Some of the most cited researchers into tax havens/offshore financial centres, including [[James R. Hines Jr.|Hines]], [[Dhammika Dharmapala|Dharmapala]] and [[Mihir A. Desai|Desai]] show evidence that, in certain cases, tax havens/OFCs, appear to promote economic growth in neighbouring higher-tax countries, and can solve issues that the higher-tax countries can have in their own tax or regulatory systems, which deter capital investment.

{{quote|Tax havens{{efn|name=Hines|From 2010, Hines stated in ''Treasure Islands'' that: "Tax havens are also known as “offshore financial centres” or “international financial centers”, phrases that may carry slightly different connotations but nevertheless are used almost interchangeably with “tax havens.”"}} change the nature of tax competition among other countries, very possibly permitting them to sustain high domestic tax rates that are effectively mitigated for mobile international investors whose transactions are routed through tax havens. [..] In fact, countries that lie close to tax havens have exhibited more rapid real income growth than have those further away, possibly in part as a result of financial flows and their market effects.|author=[[James R. Hines Jr.]] |source="Treasure Islands" p. 107 (2010)&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;}}

The most cited paper specifically on OFCs,&lt;ref name="respec"/&gt; also came a similar conclusion (although recognising that there are strong negatives as well):

{{quote|CONCLUSION: Using both bilateral and multilateral samples, we find empirically that successful offshore financial centers encourage bad behaviour in source countries since they facilitate tax evasion and money laundering [...] Nevertheless, offshore financial centers created to facilitate undesirable activities can still have unintended positive consequences. [...] We tentatively conclude that OFCs are better characterized as "symbionts".|source=Andrew K. Rose, Mark M. Spiegel, "Offshore Financial Centers: Parasites or Symbionts?", [[The Economic Journal]], (September 2007)&lt;ref name="RoseSpiegel"/&gt;}}

However, other major tax academics take the opposite view and accuse Hines (and others) of mixing cause and effect (e.g. the capital investment would have come through the normal taxed channels had the OFC option not been available), and include papers by [[Joel Slemrod|Slemrod]],&lt;ref name="Slemrod"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/teaching/SlemrodWilson09.pdf|title=Tax competition with parasitic tax havens|date=6 September 2009|journal=[[Journal of Public Economics]]|author1=[[Joel Slemrod]]|author2=John D. Wilson|quote=Although a previous literature has modelled tax havens as a benign phenomenon that helps high-tax countries reduce the negative impact of their own suboptimal domestic tax policies, there is considerable concern that the havens are “parasitic” on the tax revenues of the non-haven countries}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gabriel Zucman|Zucman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/tax-havens-dodging-theft-multinationals-avoiding-tax|title=The desperate inequality behind global tax dodging|publisher=The Guardian|author=Gabriel Zucman|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of this theory also point to studies showing that in many cases, the capital that is invested into the high tax economy via the OFC, actually originated from the high-tax economy, and for example, that the largest source of FDI into the U.K., is from the U.K., but via OFCs.&lt;ref name="imfx"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2018/06/inside-the-world-of-global-tax-havens-and-offshore-banking/damgaard.htm|title=Piercing the Veil of Tax Havens|first1=Jannick|last1= Damgaard|first2=Thomas |last2= Elkjaer|first3=Niels|last3= Johannesen | journal= International Monetary Fund: [[Finance &amp; Development|Finance &amp; Development Quarterly]]|quote=The eight major pass-through economies—the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong SAR, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Singapore—host more than 85 percent of the world’s investment in special purpose entities, which are often set up for tax reasons.|volume=55|issue=2|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quartz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1300880/tax-havens-mean-40-of-foreign-direct-investments-are-artificial/|title=How tax havens turn economic statistics into nonsense|date=11 June 2018|author=Max de Haldevang|publisher=[[Quartz (publication)]]|quote=For example, according to the UK Treasury, on the surface it looks like Britain’s second-biggest investor is the Netherlands. But the UK Treasury has admitted most of those investments actually consist of British cash that has been sent to Holland for tax purposes and rerouted back home.

This claim can get into wider, and also contested, economic debates around the optimised rate of taxation on capital and other free-market theories, as expressed by Hines in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/tax-havens-and-treasure-hunts/|title=Tax havens and treasure hunts|publisher=[[New York Times]]|quote=Some economists champion tax havens. In an article in the Journal of Economic Perspectives published last fall (also titled “Treasure Islands”), James R. Hines Jr. of the University of Michigan argued that they contribute to financial market competition, encourage investment in high-tax countries and promote economic growth.  Like many economists, Professor Hines expresses far more confidence in the market than in the state. He worries more about possible overtaxation than about undertaxation of corporate income. He does not engage with such concepts as “tax justice.”|date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offshore Financial Centre structures==
{{cleanup section|date=September 2018|reason=list of structures is unsourced and seems arbitrary and unstructured}}

===Legal structures===

The bedrock of most offshore financial centres is the formation of offshore legal structures:

*'''Asset holding vehicles''': Many corporate conglomerates employ a large number of holding companies, and often high-risk assets are parked in separate companies to prevent legal risk accruing to the main group (i.e. where the assets relate to [[asbestos]], see the English case of ''[[Adams v Cape Industries]]''). Similarly, it is quite common for fleets of ships to be separately owned by separate offshore companies to try to circumvent laws relating to group liability under certain environmental legislation.
*'''Asset protection''': Wealthy individuals who live in politically unstable countries utilise offshore companies to hold family wealth to avoid potential [[Nationalization|expropriation]] or [[exchange control]] restrictions in the country in which they live. These structures work best when the wealth is foreign-earned, or has been expatriated over a significant period of time (aggregating annual exchange control allowances).&lt;ref&gt;Legitimate asset protection against future political or economic risk should be distinguished from unlawfully attempting to evade creditors; see below.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Avoidance of forced heirship provisions''': Many countries from France to [[Saudi Arabia]] (and the U.S. state of [[Louisiana]]) continue to employ [[forced heirship]] provisions in their succession law, limiting the testator's freedom to distribute assets upon death. By placing assets into an offshore company, and then having probate for the shares in the offshore determined by the laws of the offshore jurisdiction (usually in accordance with a specific [[Will (law)|will]] or [[codicil (will)|codicil]] sworn for that purpose), the testator can sometimes avoid such strictures.
*'''Collective Investment Vehicles''': [[Mutual funds]], [[Hedge funds]], [[unit trust]]s and [[SICAV]]s are formed offshore to facilitate international distribution. By being domiciled in a low tax jurisdiction investors only have to consider the tax implications of their own domicile or residency.
*'''Derivatives and securities trading''': Wealthy individuals often form offshore vehicles to engage in risky investments, such as [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and global securities trading, which may be extremely difficult to engage in directly onshore due to cumbersome financial markets regulation.
*'''Exchange control trading vehicles'':''''' In countries where there is either [[exchange control]] or is perceived to be increased political risk with the repatriation of funds, major exporters often form trading vehicles in offshore companies so that the sales from exports can be "parked" in the offshore vehicle until needed for further investment. Trading vehicles of this nature have been criticised in a number of shareholder lawsuits which allege that by manipulating the ownership of the trading vehicle, majority shareholders can illegally avoid paying minority shareholders their fair share of trading profits.

[[File:Hong Kong China Middle-Island-01.jpg|thumb|[[Hong Kong]] is frequently a financial center for corporate structuring. ]]

* '''Joint venture vehicles''': Offshore jurisdictions are frequently used to set up [[joint venture]] companies, either as a compromise neutral jurisdiction (see for example, [[TNK-BP]]) and/or because the jurisdiction where the joint venture has its commercial centre has insufficiently sophisticated corporate and commercial laws.

*'''Stock market listing vehicles''': Successful companies who are unable to obtain a [[stock market]] listing because of the underdevelopment of the [[corporate law]] in their home country often transfer shares into an offshore vehicle, and list the offshore vehicle. Offshore vehicles are listed on the [[NASDAQ]], [[Alternative Investment Market]], the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and the [[Singapore Exchange|Singapore Stock Exchange]].
*'''Trade finance vehicles''': Large corporate groups often form offshore companies, sometimes under an [[orphan structure]] to enable them to obtain financing (either from [[bond (finance)|bond issues]] or by way of a [[syndicated loan]]) and to treat the financing as "[[off-balance-sheet]]" under applicable accounting procedures. In relation to bond issues, offshore special purpose vehicles are often used in relation to [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] transactions (particularly [[securitization|securitisations]]).
*'''Creditor avoidance''': Highly indebted persons may seek to escape the effect of bankruptcy by transferring cash and assets into an anonymous offshore company.&lt;ref&gt;In practice, such attempts are rarely effective. A [[trustee in bankruptcy]] will usually have access to all of the debtor's financial records, and will usually have little difficulty tracing where the assets were transferred to. [[Fraudulent conveyance|Transfers to defraud creditors]] are prohibited in most jurisdictions (offshore and onshore) and a bankruptcy trustee usually has little difficulty persuading a local court to nullify the transfer. Despite the poor prognosis for success, applications to courts in offshore jurisdictions seem to indicate that insolvent individuals still try this strategy from time to time, notwithstanding that it is usually a serious criminal offence in both jurisdictions.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Market manipulation''': The [[Enron scandal|Enron]] and [[Parmalat#Financial fraud (2002–2005)|Parmalat]] scandals demonstrated how companies could form offshore vehicles to manipulate financial results.
*'''Tax evasion''': Although numbers are difficult to ascertain, it is widely believed that individuals in wealthy nations unlawfully [[tax evasion|evade tax]] through not declaring gains made by offshore vehicles that they own. Multinationals including [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[Sony]] have been accused of [[Transfer pricing|transferring profits]] from the higher-tax jurisdictions in which they are made to zero-tax offshore centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/28/transfer-pricing-illegal-glaxo-dodging-taxes-personal-finance-transferprice.html|title=Illicit Transfer Pricing Endangers Shareholders|last=Morais|first=Richard C.|date=28 August 2009|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ship and aircraft registrations===
{{See also|Flags of convenience}}
[[File:EsclusasdeMiraflores2Barcos 08-130.jpg|thumb|Commercial ships register in [[Central America|Central American]] states to avoid scrutiny from foreign countries. ''Pictured'': a large carrier ship docking in [[Panama]].]]
Many offshore financial centres also provide registrations for ships (notably [[Bahamas]] and [[Panama]]) or [[Aircraft registration|aircraft]] (notably [[Aruba]], [[Bermuda]] and the [[Cayman Islands]]). Aircraft are frequently registered in offshore jurisdictions where they are leased or purchased by carriers in [[emerging markets]] but financed by banks in major onshore financial centres. The financing institution is reluctant to allow the aircraft to be registered in the carrier's home country (either because it does not have sufficient regulation governing [[civil aviation]], or because it feels the courts in that country would not cooperate fully if it needed to enforce any [[security interest]] over the aircraft), and the carrier is reluctant to have the aircraft registered in the financier's jurisdiction (often the United States or the United Kingdom) either because of personal or political reasons, or because they fear spurious lawsuits and potential arrest of the aircraft.

For example, in 2003, state carrier [[Pakistan International Airlines]] re-registered its entire fleet in the Cayman Islands as part of the financing of its purchase of eight new [[Boeing 777]]s; the U.S. bank refused to allow the aircraft to remain registered in Pakistan, and the airline refused to have the aircraft registered in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/PIA-pledges-its-fleet-to-fake-firm/articleshow/229197.cms|title=PIA pledges its fleet to fake firm|work=The Times of India|date = 12 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance===
{{See also|Captive insurance}}
A number of offshore jurisdictions promote the incorporation of [[captive insurance]] companies within the jurisdiction to allow the sponsor to manage risk. In more sophisticated offshore insurance markets, onshore [[insurance]] companies can also establish an offshore subsidiary in the jurisdiction to reinsure certain risks underwritten by the onshore parent, and thereby reduce overall reserve and capital requirements. Onshore [[reinsurance]] companies may also incorporate an offshore subsidiary to reinsure catastrophic risks.

Bermuda's insurance and re-insurance market is now the third largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;13 of the world's top 40 reinsurers are based in Bermuda, including [[American International Group|American International Underwriters Group]], [[HSBC|HSBC Insurance Solutions]], [[Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (X)|XL Capital Limited]] and [[ACE Ltd.|ACE Limited]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are also signs the primary insurance market is becoming increasingly focused upon Bermuda; in September 2006 [[Hiscox|Hiscox PLC]], the [[FTSE 250]] insurance company announced that it planned to relocate to Bermuda citing tax and regulatory advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/09/12/cnhiscox12.xml|title=Hiscox to be domiciled in 'favourable' Bermuda|last=Muspratt|first=Caroline|date=12 September 2006|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective investment vehicles===
{{See also|Offshore fund}}
[[File:Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands.jpg|thumb|The [[Cayman Islands]] are the market leaders in [[Offshore fund|offshore funding]].]]
Many offshore jurisdictions specialise in the formation of [[collective investment scheme]]s, or [[collective investment scheme|mutual funds]]. The market leader is the [[Cayman Islands]], estimated to house about 75% of world’s hedge funds and nearly half the industry's estimated $1.1 trillion of [[assets under management]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070310221113/http://www.dailyii.com/article.asp?ArticleID=1039798&amp;LS=EMS73445 |work =Institutional Investor|date = 4 May 2006|url =https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b150nvk4c9tmwg/they-cayman-they-saw-they-conquered|title = They Cayman, They Saw, They Conquered|archivedate = 10 March 2007|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although statistics in the hedge fund industry are notoriously speculative), followed by [[Bermuda]], although a market shift has meant that a number of [[hedge fund]]s are now formed in the [[British Virgin Islands]]. 

But the greater appeal of offshore jurisdictions to form mutual funds is usually in the regulatory considerations. Offshore jurisdictions tend to impose few if any restrictions on what investment strategy the mutual funds may pursue and no limitations on the amount of [[leverage (finance)|leverage]] which mutual funds can employ in their investment strategy. Many offshore jurisdictions ([[Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Guernsey]]) allow promoters to incorporate ''[[segregated portfolio company|segregated portfolio companies]]'' (or SPCs) for use as mutual funds; the unavailability of a similar corporate vehicle onshore has also helped fuel the growth of offshore incorporated funds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Banking===
{{See also|Offshore bank}}
Traditionally, a number of offshore jurisdictions offered banking licences to institutions with relatively little scrutiny. International initiatives have largely stopped this practice, and very few offshore financial centres will now issue licences to [[offshore bank]]s that do not already hold a banking licence in a major onshore jurisdiction. The most recent reliable figures for offshore banks indicates that the Cayman Islands has 285&lt;ref&gt;Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; licensed banks, the [[Bahamas]] &lt;ref&gt;Not treating Switzerland (with 500) as an offshore financial centre for these purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; has 301. By contrast, the [[British Virgin Islands]] only has seven licensed offshore banks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2089">'''Orchestra Makassy''' were an [[East Africa]]n [[soukous]] band of the late 1970s and early 1980s consisting of musicians from [[Uganda]] and [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). In 1975, under the leadership of their principal vocalist Kitenzogu "Mzee" Makassy the group moved from [[Kampala]], Uganda to [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]] taking up residence at the New Africa Hotel where they were joined by guitarists and singers such as [[Mose Fan Fan|Mose Se Sengo ('Fan Fan')]] and [[Remmy Ongala]]. One of the band's first recordings was the song "[[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]]" praising the Tanzanian independence party with lyrics based on the words of the country's first president, [[Julius Nyerere]]. In 1982, the band moved to [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] to record ''The Nairobi AGWAYA Sessions'' at the CBS Nairobi studio. Remmy Ongala left the band and stayed in Tanzania where he went on to join Orchestra Super Matimila. Mose Se Sengo left the band in Kenya to start his own band Somo Somo. The Nairobi Agwaya Sessions, produced by London-based Australian engineer, Norman Mighell, has been described as "one of the finest moments of East African rumba". The band broke up in 1984.&lt;ref name="OM-1"&gt;{{cite web

'''''Ornithoptera aesacus''''', the '''Obi Island birdwing''', is a [[Rare species|rare]] [[species]] of [[birdwing]] [[butterfly]], [[Endemism|endemic]] to the Island of [[Obira]] (formerly Obi), [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="distribution"&gt;[http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20l?id=GBIF204248149 Global Biodiversity Information Facility], record for ''Ornithoptera aesacus''&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific epithet of ''Ornithoptera aesacus'', is named after [[aesacus|Æsacus]], the eldest son of [[Priam]].

==History==
[[File:OrnithopteraObiensisRippon.jpg|thumb|left|''Ornithoptera obiensis'' in [[Robert Henry Fernando Rippon]] ''Icones Ornithopterorum'' (1898 to 1906)]]
The original description is: ''aesacus'' Ney, F. 1903 as ''Troides priamus'' Form ''aesacus''. The full reference is Ney, F. 1903 Eine neue Troides-Form von Obi. [[Insektenbörse|Insekten-Börse]] 20 (5): 36., 1903.

The depository of the four [[syntype]]s collected by J. Waterstradt in May 1902 is unknown. They were once held by [[Hermann Rolle]], whose collection, in part, was sold to [[Eugène Le Moult]].

==Description==
''Ornithoptera aesacus'' is a member of the ''[[Ornithoptera priamus]]'' [[species group]]. The two species are very similar but the male ''O. aesacus'' has a brilliant turquoise-blue sheen.

==Taxonomy==
The classification of ''Ornithoptera aesacus'' as a species does not have full consensus, and is sometimes regarded as a subspecies of ''Ornithoptera priamus'' by some, such as Parsons (1996).

===Synonymy===
*''O. obiana'' (Waterstradt [[in litt.]]) [[Hans Rebel|Rebel]], 1906
*''O. obiensis'' Rippon, 1906
*''O. obiana'' (as ''O. arruana obiana'') Rippon, 1906-1912

==Distribution==
[[File:Obi Islands Topography.png|thumb|right|The [[Obi Islands]]. ''Ornithoptera aesacus'' is known to occur only on Obira]]
The Obi Island birdwing is endemic to the Island of Obira in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="distribution" /&gt; It inhabits [[tropical rainforest]]. Due to extensive logging on the Island the conservation of the species is a concern, and has been classified as 'Vulnerable' by the IUCN&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; Twenty years ago it was the rarest birdwing species in the world. It remains threatened, but is commercially bred.

The '''Patriotic Salvation Movement''' ({{lang-ar|الحركة الوطنية للإنقاذ}}, {{lang-fr|Mouvement patriotique du salut}}, MPS) is the ruling [[political party]] in [[Chad]].

==History==
After [[Idriss Déby]], an army commander who participated in an unsuccessful plot against President [[Hissène Habré]] in 1989, fled to [[Sudan]], he and his supporters, known as the April 1 Movement, operated from Sudan with [[Libya]]n backing and carried out attacks across the border into Chad. The MPS was founded in Sudan on March 10, 1990 through the merger of the April 1 Movement with other anti-Habre groups in exile. After a successful offensive in November 1990, Déby and the MPS came to power on December 2, 1990, when their forces entered [[N'Djamena]], the Chadian capital.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lanne, "Chad: Regime Change, Increased Insecurity, and Blockage of Further Reforms", ''Political Reform in Francophone Africa'' (1997), ed. Clark and Gardinier, pages 274&amp;ndash;275.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Déby was the MPS candidate in the [[Chadian presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]] and won in a second round. He was again the MPS candidate in the [[Chadian presidential election, 2001|presidential election]] of 20 May 2001, receiving 63.2% of the vote. In the [[Chadian parliamentary election, 2002|parliamentary election]] held on 21 April 2002, the MPS won according to [[Inter-Parliamentary Union|IPU Parline]] 113 out of 155 seats. In the [[Chadian presidential election, 2006|May 2006 presidential election]], Déby was re-elected with 64.7% of the vote.

The '''Republic of Ilirida''' ({{lang-sq|Republika e Iliridës}}) is a proposed state declared twice by politician [[Nevzat Halili]], once in 1992 and once in 2014. The idea has been declared unconstitutional by the Macedonian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Turkish yearbook of international  relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt9VAAAAYAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Dış Münasebetler Enstitüsü, Siyasal Bilgiler Fakültesi, Ankara Üniversitesi|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secessionist concept of Ilirida emerged in the early 1990s and was advocated by some Albanian politicians as a solution to concerns and disputes the Albanian community had regarding constitutional recognition and minority rights within Macedonia.&lt;ref name = Bugajski&gt;Bugajski, Janusz (1994). ''[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PXScAJFQFloC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Republic+of+Ilirida&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Republic%20of%20Ilirida&amp;f=false Ethnic politics in Eastern Europe: a guide to nationality policies, organizations, and parties]''. ME Sharpe. pp. 116-117. "The PDP also abstained from voting on the new constitution, arguing that the document did not provide sufficient provision for the group rights of Albanians. Halili asserted that he would continue to press for amendments in the constitution to redefine the Albanians as a constituent nation and more solidly guarantee their “collective rights.” If this proved impossible to achieve, then the PDP would consider the constitution invalid and undertake steps toward full minority autonomy. PDP leaders have urged the holding of new elections once a fairer election law was passed by parliament and electoral districts were rearranged. They also supported some measure of territorial autonomy for regions containing Albanian majorities within an independent Macedonia. According to Halili, such regions could form an Assembly of Citizens that would be eligible to pass laws on education, the local economy, police, and local courts. A referendum on autonomy among the Albanian community in January 1992 was won overwhelmingly by a pro-autonomy vote, but the plebiscite was immediately dismissed as invalid by the Macedonian government. After the ballot, several local leaders in predominantly Albanian communes in western Macedonia declared the region as the Republic of Ilirida, Stating their objective as the unification of all Albanians in the former Yugoslavia. In the interim, they favored the federalization of Macedonia in which Ilirida would cover approximately half of the republic’s territory. The government vowed to combat any anti-constitutional attempts to create parallel authorities in Macedonia. PDP leaders criticized the Ilirida proclamation and denied that they intended to partition Macedonia and join the region with an independent Kosovo or with Albania. The state-controlled Belgrade media reported with some relish on the Ilirida declaration and the potential partition of Macedonia."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danforth, Loring (1997). ''[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PXScAJFQFloC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Republic+of+Ilirida&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Republic%20of%20Ilirida&amp;f=false The Macedonian conflict: Ethnic nationalism in a transnational world]''. Princeton University Press. p. 145. "The Albanians in Macedonia, however, have expressed dissatisfaction with their minority status in a variety of ways. They boycotted the September 8, 1991, referendum which established the Republic of Macedonia as a sovereign and independent state. Then, in January 1992, they held their own referendum and voted overwhelmingly in favor of “the political and territorial autonomy of Albanians in Macedonia” and the establishment of their own state, to be named the Republic of Ilirida."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Goldman&gt;Goldman, Minton (1996). ''[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aLZlX13le_wC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=Ilirida+separatism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ilirida%20separatism&amp;f=false Revolution and change in Central and Eastern Europe: political, economic, and social challenges]''. ME Sharpe. pp. 324-325. "With the failure of the republic leaders in discussions held in 1991 to agree on a plan for transforming Yugoslavia into a confederation, the Macedonian government planned for complete independence. In early September 1991, it held a national referendum on independence, in which Macedonians voted overwhelmingly for separation from Yugoslavia. In November 1991, Macedonia formalized its new status and a commitment to democratic processes when it approved a new constitution. Although the preamble was similar to the preamble of the Croatian constitution in that it emphasized historical aspirations for national independence, the constitution also called for “cohabitation” between Macedonian and non-Macedonian people and therefore was somewhat less ethnically chauvinistic than the Croatian document. To serve the interests of the ethnic minorities, the constitution provided for the establishment of a Council for Inter- ethnic Relations within the legislature. The new document nevertheless alarmed Macedonia’s Albanian minority, which made up 23 percent of the republic’s population and opposed independence. They were worried that, despite provisions that appeared to guarantee minority rights, the Skopje government, which was controlled by ethnic Macedonians fearful of an outbreak of Albanian separatism, would discriminate against them and get away with it because of the failure of the constitution to identify them as a “nation.” The Albanian minority wanted assurances, which they never received from the Macedonian political leadership, that once Macedonia was independent of Yugoslavia the new republic would not violate their cultural rights and try to assimilate them. By 1992, local Albanian leaders were demanding autonomy for Ilirida, as they called the territory in northwest Macedonia where the bulk of Albanian-speaking people resided. The demands of Macedonian Albanians and their talk of the possibility of joining kinsmen in Kosovo and in the Republic of Albania to create a “Greater Albania” began to resemble the situation of Croatia’s Serb minority in the Krajina. Albanian politicians in Macedonia urged the EC not to recognize the independence of Yugoslav Macedonia on the grounds that it failed to meet the Union’s human- and civil-rights standards. Other ethnic minorities, notably, Greeks, Bulgarians, and Serbs, shared the worry of the Albanians. The problem for an independent Macedonia was to make sure that its powerful neighbors would not use the protection of these minorities as a pretext for interference in its internal affairs and possibly even some landgrabbing."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Makedonija - Etnicki sastav po naseljima 2002.gif|thumb|220px|Ethnic groups in the Republic of Macedonia according to the 2002 census, with Albanians in brown]]
A referendum on the status of the Albanians in Macedonia, declared illegal by the Macedonian government, was held in January 1992. 74% out of 92% of those eligible to vote, voted for the autonomy of the Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Federalism, Regionalism, Local Autonomy and Minorities: Proceedings, Cividale Del Friuli (Italy), 24-26 October 1996 : Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ycTQOISqWQC&amp;pg=PA82|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Council of Europe|isbn=978-92-871-3434-9|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 1992, about 40,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated on the streets of Skopje, asking that Macedonia remain an unrecognized state until areas with an Albanian majority were autonomous.&lt;ref name="Daskalovski2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Židas Daskalovski|title=Walking on the Edge: Consolidating Multiethnic Macedonia, 1989-2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5RtM_MZlgVcC&amp;pg=PA68|year=2006|publisher=Globic Press|isbn=978-0-9776662-3-2|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

6 days later, on April 6, 1992, the Republic of Ilirida, was proclaimed by [[Albanians in Macedonia|Albanian Macedonian]] activists in [[Struga]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], the main organizer being former [[Party for Democratic Prosperity|PDP]] member, Nevzat Halili, in front of a crowd of 2,500 people.&lt;ref name="Ahrens2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geert-Hinrich Ahrens|title=Diplomacy on the Edge: Containment of Ethnic Conflict and the Minorities Working Group of the Conferences on Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3fLRcHYSVAC&amp;pg=PA399|date=6 March 2007|publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8557-0|pages=399–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed republic would have covered approximately half of Macedonia's territory, mainly where Albanians form large concentrations and/ or majorities in the west and northwest.&lt;ref name = Bugajski/&gt;&lt;ref name = Goldman/&gt; It intended to unite all Albanians living under the former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name = Goldman/&gt; Later on, the aim of the republic was that of favoring the federalization of Macedonia.&lt;ref name = Bugajski/&gt;

On November 6, 1992 Macedonian police used force to disperse ethnic Albanians who were protesting for the release of a cigarette smuggler. Clashes with police resulted in the deaths of 4 Albanians and 36 injured. The Macedonian police seized 2,000 leaflets signed by the Ilirida Albanian youth movement, which called for the Albanians of Macedonian to wage war for their rights to self-determination.&lt;ref name="Daskalovski2006"/&gt;

At that time a group of Albanian activists were accused by Skopje that they were in possession of 300 machine guns and ready to organize an uprising of 20,000 Albanians to achieve the goal of the creation of the Republic of Ilirida.&lt;ref name="Miall1994"/&gt; According to the official sources of the Macedonian government, there was coordination between the Macedonian Albanian activists, and the Kosovo Albanians, as well as by Albania.&lt;ref name="Miall1994"/&gt; The government of Albania denied these accusations, and so did [[Ibrahim Rugova]], then president of the [[Republic of Kosova]].&lt;ref name="Miall1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Miall|title=Minority rights in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxswAQAAIAAJ|date=1 November 1994|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations Press|isbn=978-0-87609-172-2|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 Halili was tried for “paramilitary” secessionism, but was not jailed, however he quit politics since.&lt;ref name=Marusic/&gt;

The opening of the [[University of Tetova|University of Tetovo]] in 1994 served as a trial balloon for the parallel independent educational institutions of the Albanians in Macedonia.&lt;ref name=FBIS/&gt; The plan was to create similar institutions around other areas of the economy as well.&lt;ref name=FBIS&gt;{{cite book|title=FBIS Daily Report: East Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_MTAQAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=The Service|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Muhamed Halili, then coordinator of the now split [[Party for Democratic Prosperity]] (PDP), declared to a Bulgarian newspaper that the party still wanted to achieve autonomy, and the Albanians' autonomy in Macedonia was the "first stage of the two-nation state".&lt;ref name="Ramet1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabrina P. Ramet|title=Whose Democracy?: Nationalism, Religion, and the Doctrine of Collective Rights in Post-1989 Eastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GghxFpyBH7MC&amp;pg=PA80|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-8324-6|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other Albanian leaders kept silent about the issue, but in June 1994 the [[Albanian National Party]] (NPD) resolved that "Ilirida autonomy is the minimum which the Albanians of Macedonia should realize", and, Abdurahman Haliti, president of the PDP, warned that "those who think that the autonomy option for the Albanians of Macedonia doesn't exist, are wrong".&lt;ref name="Ramet1997"/&gt;

By 1999 the [[Albanian Paramilitary in Macedonia|Albanian Paramilitary]] of the Republic of Ilirida had been created, and were deemed illegal by the government of Skopje, however tolerated.&lt;ref name="BrownRosecrance1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael E.

In 2002 the Army of the Republic of Ilirida was created. The goal of the army is to incorporate Western Macedonia into Albania or into Kosovo. Allegedly composed of 200 members, it was rumored that the army members took an oath with [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1939)|Leka Zogu]], then Crown Prince of Albania, however he denied that.&lt;ref name="StojarováEmerson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vera Stojarová|author2=Peter Emerson|title=Party Politics in the Western Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQsjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98|date=2 October 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-23584-0|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the idea of the Republic of Ilirida seemed to have been abandoned by its proponents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indiana Slavic Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fddmAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Indiana University.|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; on September 18, 2014, a few dozen Albanians assembled in [[Skopje]] to declare the formation of the Republic of Ilirida.&lt;ref name=Marusic&gt;{{cite news |last=Marusic |first=Sinisa Jakov |date=September 19, 2014 |title= Albanians Declare 'Republic' in Macedonia|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/republic-of-ilirida-declared-in-macedonia |deadurl= |newspaper=Balkaninsight |location= |accessdate= September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nevzat Halili, the self-proclaimed president, the right of [[Albanians in Macedonia]] to self-determination and the proclamation of Ilirida as an autonomous region is based on the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://inserbia.info/today/2014/09/albanians-proclaimed-republic-of-ilirida-in-macedonia/|title=Albanians proclaim "Republic of Ilirida" in Macedonia|publisher=InSerbia|date=September 19, 2014|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halili threatened to organise a referendum if his plans are ignored by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=19&amp;nav_id=91668|title="Republic of Ilirida" declared in Macedonia|date=September 19, 2014|accessdate=September 20, 2014|publisher=b92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thalia Theater''' is one of the three state-owned theatres in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. It was founded in 1843 by [[Charles Maurice Schwartzenberger]] and named after the [[muse]] [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]]. Today, it is home to one of Germany's most famous ensembles and stages around 9 new plays per season. Current theatre manager is [[Joachim Lux]], who in 2009/10 succeeded [[Ulrich Khuon]].

In addition to its main building, located in the street ''Raboisen'' in the [[Altstadt, Hamburg|Altstadt]] quarter near the [[Binnenalster]] and [[Gerhart-Hauptmann-Platz]] in Hamburg's inner city, the theatre operates a smaller stage, used for experimental plays, the '''Thalia in der Gaußstraße''', located in the borough of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]].

==Plays==
In October 1991 [[Ruth Berghaus]] directed [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[In The Jungle of Cities]]'' (German: ''Im Dickicht der Städte'') as part of a series of 'related texts', as she called them (which also included [[Georg Büchner|Büchner]]'s ''[[Danton's Death]]'').&lt;ref name="meech54"&gt;Meech (1994, 54).&lt;/ref&gt;
