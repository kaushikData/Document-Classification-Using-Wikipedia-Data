      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5319">'''CRP-2B''' ('''Crisis Relocation Program 2B''') is a hypothetical scenario of [[nuclear war]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] that was created in 1976 by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]].  It involved the detonation of 1444 weapons, with a yield of 6559 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]]s, and projected an American death toll of between 85 and 125 [[megadeath]]s.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book|title=Mission Improbable|author=Lee Ben Clarke|pages=36|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1999|isbn=0-226-10941-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medical Implications of Nuclear War|author=Fredric Solomon and Robert Q. Marston|pages=590|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1986|isbn=0-309-03636-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; CRP-2B predicts a "[[countervalue]]" attack (an attack targeting cities instead of military and industrial infrastructure).

The program was referred to as a "study", but in fact it was the product of a computer simulation.  It was also the source of an 80% survival rate figure that was quoted by many people in the years afterwards.  The 80% survival rate was an initial assumption, built into the parameters of the computer simulation by its designers. The assumption stems from the conditions of the scenario, with historical precendence in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]: FEMA assumes that the nuclear exchange would be preceded by 3–5 days of "heightened tensions" that would give Americans time to evacuate major cities.&lt;ref name=fas&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/lib-www/la-pubs/00173165.pdf |title=NUCLEAR WINTER: THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF HUMAN SURVIVAL |last1=Bumstead |first1=Pamela |date=December 6, 1985 |publisher=American Anthropological Association |location=Washington, DC |conference=84th Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological Association
 |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But as the program came to be a "study", so the survival rate figure came to be the "finding" of the study.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

Charles F. Estes Jr., director of strategic police at the Office of the Undersecretary of Defence for Policy, stated:&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;
{{quote|text=It was assumed at the outset that 80 percent of the population of hypothesized target areas would in fact have been evacuated and would survive.  [&amp;hellip;] [T]his was an entering assumption rather than one of the study's analytically derived findings. [&amp;hellip;] It is importance to note that the survivability assumptions [&amp;hellip;] of the computer model were derived from opinions of interested civil defense program managers, academics, and contractor personnel  These opinions were obtained through the use of accepted opinion survey techniques.|sign=Charles F. Estes Jr.|source=&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;&lt;ref name=LeaningKeyes&gt;{{cite book|title=Counterfeit Ark: Crisis Relocation for Nuclear War|author=Jennifer Leaning and Langley Carleton Keyes|publisher=Ballinger Pub. Co.|year=1983|isbn=0-88410-940-2|pages=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This 80% figure was quoted in the 1980s by U.S. congresspeople and other officials.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

== Criticism ==
The 80% survival rate assumption has since came under significant criticism from academics and organizations like the [[Federation of American Scientists]] (FAS). FAS criticized CRP-2B for failing to consider the potential ecological impacts of nuclear war, including [[nuclear winter]], disruptions to agriculture, and the radioactive contamination of water supplies. It further criticized CRP-2B for studying only direct and immediate consequences of the attacks, ignoring the long-term threats to human health posed by [[ionizing radiation]] and social problems caused by breakdowns in law and order, strife between relocated populations and host communities, and disruptions to the supply of medical equipment.&lt;ref name=fas /&gt; [[Stanford University]] radiologist and anti-nuclear activist [[Herbert L. Abrams]] was particularly critical of the scenario's assumptions regarding the injured. He noted that hospitals would quickly be overwhelmed by the number of victims, particularly burn victims, who already face shortages of beds, medical personnel, and resources. Abrams estimated that because 80% of hospitals are in urban areas and would so be destroyed in the attack, there would 1 bed for every 563 severely injured patients. Hospitals would face similar post-attack shortages for blood, plasma, and other fluids and drugs and bandages, which would prevent effective treatment of the wounded and patients with chronic illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Herbert|authorlink1=Herbert L. Abrams|editor1-last=Marston|editor1-first=Solomon|title=The Medical Implications of Nuclear War|date=1986|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|location=Washington, DC|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK219179/|accessdate=25 April 2018|chapter=Medical Supply and Demand in a Post-Nuclear-War World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account these impacts on medical facilities, Abrams estimates that only 60 million Americans would survive in the CRP-2B scenario, before nuclear winter, social strife, and disruptions to the food supply are considered.&lt;ref name=fas /&gt;

[[File:Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg|alt=A monochrome, profile illustration of four oxen dragging a plough through a field. The ploughman walks behind, controlling the plough, while his colleague stands to his side, holding a long whip in the air.|Some carucages were assessed on ploughteams, such as this four-ox-team plough, redrawn from the [[Luttrell Psalter]], an [[illuminated manuscript]] of c. 1330.&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt ''Ties that Bound'' p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;|thumb|400px]]

'''Carucage'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ær|ə|k|ᵻ|dʒ}};&lt;ref&gt;Staff "Carucage" ''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-lat-med|carrūcāgium}}, from ''carrūca'', "wheeled plough"&lt;ref&gt;Mantella and Rigg ''Medieval Latin'' p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;}} was a medieval English [[Land value tax|land tax]] introduced by King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] in 1194, based on the size—variously calculated—of the estate owned by the taxpayer. It was a replacement for the [[danegeld]], last imposed in 1162, which had become difficult to collect because of an increasing number of exemptions. Carucage was levied just six times: by Richard in 1194 and 1198; [[John of England|John]], his brother and successor, in 1200; and John's son, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], in 1217, 1220, and 1224, after which it was replaced by taxes on income and [[personal property]].

The taxable value of an estate was initially assessed from the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]], but other methods were later employed, such as valuations based on the sworn testimony of neighbours or on the number of plough-teams the taxpayer used. Carucage never raised as much as other taxes, but nevertheless helped to fund several projects. It paid the [[Richard I of England#Captivity and return|ransom for Richard's release]] in 1194, after he was taken prisoner by [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]]; it covered the tax John had to pay [[Philip II of France]] in 1200 on land he inherited in that country; and it helped to finance Henry III's military campaigns in England and on continental Europe.

Carucage was an attempt to secure new sources of revenue in order to supplement and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances. Although derived from the older danegeld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.

==Background==
{{main|Taxation in medieval England|History of the English fiscal system}}
In medieval England there was no clear separation between the king's household and the treasury.&lt;ref name=SaulGovern&gt;Saul "Government" ''Companion to Medieval England'' pp. 115–118&lt;/ref&gt; The main sources of royal income were the royal estates, [[Feudalism|feudal rights]] (such as [[feudal aid]]s or [[feudal relief]]s, which derived from the king's position as a [[Feudal lord|feudal overlord]]), taxation, and fees and other profits from the judicial courts. In 1130, the records of revenues paid into the treasury show that about 40% came from royal estates, 16% from feudal rights, 14% from taxes, and 12% from the judicial courts.&lt;ref name=Bartlett165&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; By 1194 revenue from the land came to about 37% of the total,{{efn|This includes the revenues that the sheriffs collected from the shires, the [[Farm#Etymology|farm]] of the shire, which included not only taxes, but also rents and other payments from the king's lands.&lt;ref name=Dict120&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary'' p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barratt645&gt;Barratt "English Revenue of King Richard" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 645–646&lt;/ref&gt;}} about 25% came from feudal rights, taxation raised about 15%, and income from judicial sources about 11%.&lt;ref name=Barratt645/&gt;{{efn|The numbers do not add up to 100% exactly because of rounding and because a few sources of income do not fit into the above categories. These include income from the [[royal forest]]s and money gained from the Jews in England.&lt;ref name=Barratt645/&gt;}}

English taxation after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of 1066 was based on the geld or danegeld, a national tax paid by all free men, those who were not [[serfdom|serfs]] or slaves. The geld was based on the number of [[Hide (unit)|hides]] of land owned by the taxpayer,&lt;ref name=Huscroft98/&gt;{{efn|A hide was a variable amount of land, often equated to the amount of land required to support a family for a year, or the amount of land an eight-ox ploughteam would plough in one year. The total amount varied wildly depending on the fertility of the land. The size could be as small as {{convert|40|acre|ha}} in Berkshire, up to {{convert|120|acre|ha}} elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Dict154&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'' p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;}} and could be demanded by the king and assessed at varying levels without the need for consultation with the barons or other subjects. During King [[Henry I of England|Henry I's]] reign, an increasing number of exemptions, and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld, lowered its importance to the [[Exchequer]]—the treasury of England. It is unclear whether the geld was collected at all during the reign of Henry's successor, King Stephen.&lt;ref name=Huscroft98&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 98–99, 166&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen's successor, King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], collected the geld only twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161–1162. The geld was unpopular, and after 1162 Henry may have felt it politically expedient to stop collecting it.&lt;ref name=Huscroft166&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;

Most information about the carucage comes from the financial records associated with its collection, but there is no detailed description of the way it was collected or assessed, unlike the account of the workings of the Exchequer given in the ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer]]'', written in about 1180.&lt;ref name=Mitchell129&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Government records such as the [[Pipe Roll]]s, the [[Memoranda Roll]]s, and other financial records,&lt;ref name=Tax135/&gt; some of which are specific to the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected.&lt;ref name=Tax136&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.&lt;ref name=Tax14/&gt;

==Under Richard I==
Under Henry's son, King Richard I, a new land tax was collected, the first since 1162. It was organised by [[Hubert Walter]], the [[Justiciar]] of England who was in charge of governing England while the king was gone. Like the geld, the carucage was based on the amount of land owned,&lt;ref name=Govern105/&gt; thus targeting free men rather than serfs, who owned no land and were therefore exempt.&lt;ref name=Coredon255&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'' p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; First collected in 1194, and the first land tax collected in England since the geld,&lt;ref name=Lyon253&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; carucage was based on the size of the estate as measured in either hides or [[carucate]]s&lt;ref name=Govern105&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance of Mediaeval England'' p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; (a unit of land that could be ploughed by an eight-ox plough-team in a year,&lt;ref name=Dict61&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'' p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; which was normally considered equivalent to a hide).&lt;ref name=Hudson241&gt;Hudson ''Formation of the English Common Law'' p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Because the first collection of the carucage was levied to pay Richard's ransom when he was imprisoned during his return from the [[Third Crusade]], this incident of the tax can also be considered a [[feudal aid]]—a payment from a feudal [[vassal]] to their overlord required when the latter had to be ransomed.&lt;ref name=Lyon269/&gt;}} The original property assessment of the carucage was based on the Domesday Survey, a survey of land holdings in England that was completed by 1087.&lt;ref name=Lyon269/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bartlett194&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

Collected again in 1198,&lt;ref name=Lyon269/&gt; and usually called the "great carucage",&lt;ref name=Tax14&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; it was initially assessed at a rate of 2&amp;nbsp;[[shilling]]s per carucate (estimated at {{convert|100|acre|ha}}&lt;ref name=Lyon269/&gt; or {{convert|120|acre|ha}}&lt;ref name=Tax154&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;), but later an additional 3&amp;nbsp;shillings per carucate was imposed.&lt;ref name="Tax14"/&gt; This 1198 collection was to provide the king with money for his military campaigns in France,&lt;ref name=Tax179&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; and raised about £1,000.&lt;ref name=Richard637&gt;Barratt "English Revenue of King Richard" ''English Historical Review'' p. 637&lt;/ref&gt; A number of fines were subsequently imposed on taxpayers for evading payment,{{efn|These are recorded in the 1199 Pipe Roll.&lt;ref name=Richard642/&gt;}} suggesting that the 1198 tax was not very successful.&lt;ref name=Richard642&gt;Barratt "English Revenue of King Richard" ''English Historical Review'' p. 642&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the late 12th century chronicler [[Roger of Howden]], the main source for information on the 1198 carucage,&lt;ref name=Tax14/&gt; assessments were carried out in county by a commission of two royal officials working in each [[Hundred (administrative division)|hundred]] (a subdivision of a county). Each of these commissions included two local knights who would take sworn testimonies in each village from four villagers and the [[bailiff]]s or estate officials of those barons holding land in the village. The resulting assessments were recorded, and the sheriff, or chief royal official of the county, would receive the money and forward it to the treasury.&lt;ref name=Lyon269&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Estate holders in the area were responsible for the payments from their estates, and when they were handed to the Exchequer a special procedure was followed to record the payments,&lt;ref name=Warren147/&gt; which were then deposited into a dedicated set of accounts.&lt;ref name=Tax29&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; These elaborate procedures were probably meant to avoid misappropriation of funds, but may not have been successful, as justices were later sent out to inquire into the commissioners' activities. As a result of their investigations, 23&amp;nbsp;counties paid fines to secure an end to royal inquiries and any arrears in payments.&lt;ref name=Warren147&gt;Warren ''Governance of Norman and Angevin England'' pp. 147–148&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower clergy and bishops resisted Richard's attempt to impose the 1198 carucage on their estates. In response, Richard withdrew their access to his royal courts forcing them to buy it back for a sum greater than the carucage would have collected.&lt;ref name=Lyon305&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 305–306&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The royal courts were the best way for non-serfs to litigate when they were dispossessed of land by other freemen, as well as being the main way of obtaining justice in criminal matters.&lt;ref name=Justice152&gt;Saul "Justice" ''Companion to Medieval England'' p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Under John==
King John, Richard's brother and successor, collected the carucage only once, in 1200. John set the amount to be collected from each carucate at three shillings.&lt;ref name=Lyon269/&gt; Revenues from this taxation do not appear in the 1200 Pipe Roll, although the designation in official records of [[William of Wrotham]] and his assistants as ''receptores carucagii''—"receivers of the carucage"—suggest that the money raised was paid into a special commission in the Exchequer.&lt;ref name=Tax14/&gt; Whether lands were assessed by the system used in 1198 is unknown.&lt;ref name=Tax65&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary chronicler [[Ralph of Coggeshall]] noted that an "order went throughout England by the justices or&lt;!--not "of"?--&gt;&lt;!-- Double checked, the source does indeed say "or" Eald. --&gt; the king" to collect the tax,{{efn|Or possibly "from the justices" in place of "by the justices".&lt;ref name=Tax83&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=QTax83&gt;Quoted in Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; which may imply that the King appointed justices to collect the tax instead of using the earlier system.&lt;ref name=Tax83/&gt; The carucage was raised in order to pay John's feudal relief— the payment to an overlord on inheriting lands—for his 1199 inheritance of lands in France.&lt;ref name=Tax179/&gt; The relief had been set by King Philip II of France, John's overlord, at 20,000 [[mark (money)|marks]].&lt;ref name=John148&gt;Warren ''King John'' pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the amount raised by this carucage—about £3,000—are based on later revenues raised during the following reign.&lt;ref name=Barratt839&gt;Barratt "Revenue of King John" ''English Historical Review'' p. 839&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monasteries in the north of England resisted the tax, claiming that they were immune to taxation. John put pressure on them, as he was in the north when the tax was announced, but the various abbeys appealed to Hubert Walter, by then Chancellor. Walter secured from the abbeys the promise of a group payment of £1,000, but in June 1200 the King rejected the offer. In October, the King returned from Normandy and resumed pressure on the monasteries, ordering the confiscation of all Cistercian livestock on royal lands after two weeks if a settlement was not reached. At the end of November, through Walter's intercession, the King capitulated and agreed to a Cistercian immunity from this tax.&lt;ref name=Monastic366&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order'' pp. 366–367&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Henry III==
John's son, King Henry III, assessed the carucage on three occasions, in 1217, 1220, and 1224. A new approach in 1217 and 1220 was to secure the consent of leading noblemen for the tax to be levied.&lt;ref name=Lyon384/&gt; The 1217 tax was once again assessed at 3&amp;nbsp;shillings per carucate.&lt;ref name=Tax135&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment of the amount of lands held by each taxpayer involved having each landowner provide the information and swear an oath that it was correct.&lt;ref name=Tax92&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Like the 1200 tax, the 1217 tax was not recorded in that year's Pipe Roll, lending support to the possibility that the revenue from the tax was sent to a separate branch of the Exchequer.&lt;ref name=Tax19/&gt; The 1217 carucage was only paid by [[Laity|laymen]]; the [[clergy]] made a donation in lieu of being taxed.&lt;ref name=Tax109&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The money raised was intended to defray the expense of the war being fought against Prince [[Louis VIII of France|Louis of France]], who had invaded England before the death of King John and was claiming the English throne.&lt;ref name=Harriss33/&gt;

The 1220 carucage, which was imposed on both laymen and clergy,&lt;ref name=Lyon384/&gt; was collected by a special commission, and was paid not into the Exchequer, but to the [[Templar Order]] church in London, the [[Temple Church|New Temple]].&lt;ref name=Tax19/&gt; The Templars through their international organization functioned as bankers in and between countries.&lt;ref name=Monasticism214&gt;Lawrence ''Medieval Monasticism'' p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The three men appointed to the commission—William de Halliwell, a friar, William FitzBenedict, a London resident, and Alexander de Sawbridgeworth, an Exchequer clerk&lt;ref name=Tax19&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;—were responsible for accounting for the money received, which amounted to £3,000.&lt;ref name=Tax34&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The time frame of the 1220 carucage collection was quite short; the orders for the assessments to be made were issued in August, but required the tax to be collected by [[Michaelmas]] in late September.&lt;ref name=Tax105&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The 1220 tax attempted to allow for variation in land values, exempting barren land from taxation.&lt;ref name=Lyon384&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; The system for the 1220 assessments was simpler than the 1217 levy, as plough-teams were counted to determine the land size rather than requiring oaths from taxpayers. This tax gathered around £5,500.&lt;ref name=Warren147/&gt; There was some difficulty in its collection however, as some counties did not pay, and a number of barons refused to pay, at least at first.&lt;ref name=Tax137&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The 1220 carucage was levied to pay for the defence of Henry's lands in [[Poitou]], southern France.&lt;ref name=Harriss33/&gt;

The 1224 carucage was a tax levied only on the clergy,&lt;ref name=Tax67&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; and the revenues from it did not appear in that year's Pipe Roll. It is likely that the clergy who owed the carucage also collected the tax. Records indicate that the bulk of the money raised was paid into the [[Wardrobe (government)|Wardrobe]], the king's personal treasury, rather than the Exchequer.&lt;ref name=Tax20&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The 1224 assessment was based on ploughteams,&lt;ref name=Tax154/&gt; and was imposed to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France.&lt;ref name=Harriss33&gt;Harriss ''King, Parliament, and Public Finance'' p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The last carucage was imposed in 1224,&lt;ref name=Tax154/&gt; after which most of the medieval government's revenue was raised by levying taxes on moveable or personal property, instead of on land;&lt;ref name=Lyon382&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 382–384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitchell113&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; taxes on moveable property were first assessed in 1207.&lt;ref name=Campbell51/&gt; A probable reason for the abandonment of land taxes was the greater revenues raised by taxes on property and income.&lt;ref name=Tax237&gt;Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Carucage was an attempt to secure new sources of revenue to supplement existing sources of income.&lt;ref name=Harriss9/&gt; It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them. Although derived from the older geld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes.&lt;ref name=Harriss9&gt;Harriss ''King, Parliament, and Public Finance'' pp. 9–15&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained [[scutage]], feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system.&lt;ref name=Campbell51&gt;Campbell "Some Observations on English Government" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Investigative Journalism''' ('''CIJ''') is a British Charity providing training to journalists, researchers, producers and students in the practice and methodology of [[investigative journalism]]. Incorporated as a Company Limited by Guarantee in June 2005 and registered as a Charity in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends02/0001118602_AC_20121130_E_C.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; Using grants from the Lorana Sullivan Foundation, the CIJ organises annual three-day summer schools, an annual investigative film week and courses in data journalism and investigative techniques. It has provided training to thousands of journalists, researchers and students from over 35 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Renaissance of Investigative Journalism Summer School at the CIJ in London |url=http://www.mediakritiek.be/blog/2009/07/the_renaissance_of_investigative_journalism_summer_school_at_the_cij_in_london.html |publisher=www.mediakritiek.be |accessdate=18 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408230205/http://www.mediakritiek.be/blog/2009/07/the_renaissance_of_investigative_journalism_summer_school_at_the_cij_in_london.html |archivedate=8 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIJ is based at the School of Journalism at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gold.ac.uk/media-communications/school-of-journalism/|title=School of Journalism|website=Goldsmiths, University of London|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014, has held the CIJ summer school each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gold.ac.uk/media-communications/cij/|title=The Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ)|website=Goldsmiths, University of London|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work has been supplemented by publication of Logan handbooks on investigative methods and techniques and mentoring journalist youth groups and young filmmakers.

The CIJ’s supporters include reporters from the [[BBC Radio]] and Television, [[Canal Plus]] (Paris), [[CBS 60 Minutes]], [[Channel Four]], ''[[Private Eye]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Insight Team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Evans is new Centre for Investigative Journalism patron|url=http://adrianmonck.com/2008/06/harry-evans-is-new-centre-for-investigative-journalism-patron/|publisher=Adrianmonck.com|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'', and [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIJ summer school line-up includes speakers from ProPublica, ''The New York Times'' and Wikileaks |url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/2/articles/535132.php |publisher=www.journalism.co.uk |accessdate=18 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306203320/https://www.journalism.co.uk/2/articles/535132.php |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2007 the CIJ acquired registered charity status&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1118602&amp;subid=0&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted support from a number of foundations including the [[Open Society Foundations|Open Society Institute]], the [[David E. Potter|David and Elaine Potter Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Roy H. Park|Park Foundation]], the Reva and David Logan Foundation, Democratie en Media, [[Goldsmiths]], [[University of London]], and several smaller private trusts.

In 2009, the CIJ was instrumental in helping to found the [[Bureau for Investigative Journalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/|publisher=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an independent, foundation-supported producer of in-depth reporting in defence of the public interest.

In 2012, the CIJ instituted a programme of active pro bono assistance, counselling and defence to whistleblowers and those who have exposed crimes and wrongdoing in their workplace.

The CIJ recently launched a programme on information security, organising workshops for journalists, researchers and lawyers on encryption, Tor, OTR and other protective technologies. In 2014, the organisation also began a series of conferences which bring together journalists, technologists and hacktivists to forge alliances against [[mass surveillance]] and censorship. These events are titled the CIJ Logan Symposia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4901">The '''Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act''' ([[Act of Congress|Public Law]] 93-247) of 1988 provides [[federal government of the United States|federal]] funding to [[US states]] in support of prevention, assessment, investigation, prosecution, and treatment activities and provides grants to public agencies and [[nonprofit]] [[organization]]s for demonstration programs and projects. Additionally, it identifies the federal role in supporting research, evaluation, technical assistance, and data collection activities; establishes the Office on Child Abuse and Neglect; and mandates the National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information. It also sets forth a minimum definition of child abuse and neglect.

The key federal [[legislation]] addressing [[child abuse]] and [[neglect]] is the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), originally enacted in 1974 ([[Public Law 93-247]]). It was amended several times and was most recently amended and reauthorized by the CAPTA Reauthorization Act on December 20, 2010.

The complete text of the lengthy law is listed under [[U.S. Code]] [[Title]] 42, Chapter 67.[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/ch67.html]. A booklet presenting CAPTA, as amended by the [[Keeping Children and Families Safe Act]] of 2003, including the [[Adoption Opportunities]] program and [[Abandoned Infants Assistance Act]], as amended, is available from the [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20050404175355/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/laws/capta03/index.htm]

==Legislative history==
The law was completely rewritten in the [[Child Abuse Prevention, Adoption and Family Services Act]] of 1988 (Public Law 100-294). It was further amended by the [[Child Abuse Prevention Challenge Grants Reauthorization Act]] of 1989 ([[P.L. 101-126]] and the [[Drug Free School Amendments]] of 1989 ([[Public Law 101-226]]).

The [[Community-Based Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Grants]] was a program that was originally authorized by Sections 402 to 409 of the [[Continuing Appropriations Act]] for [[Fiscal year|Fiscal Year]] 1985 ([[Public Law 98-473]]). The [[Child Abuse Prevention Challenge Grants Reauthorization Act]] of 1989 (Public Law 101-126) transferred the program to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, as amended.

A new Title III, Certain Preventive Services Regarding Children of Homeless Families or Families at Risk of Homelessness, was added to the Child Abuse and Neglect and Treatment Act by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act Amendments of 1990 (Public Law 101-645).

The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act was amended and reauthorized by the [[Child Abuse, Domestic Violence Adoption and Family Services Act]] of 1992 ([[Public Law 102-295]]), and amended by the [[Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act]] [[Amendments]] of 1992 ([[Public Law 102-586]]).

The Act was amended by the Older American Act Technical Amendments of 1993 (Public Law 103-171, 12/2/93) and the Human Services Amendments of 1994 (Public Law 103-252, 5/19/94).
 
CAPTA was further amended by the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act Amendments of 1996 (P.L. 104-235, 10/3/96), which amended Title I, replaced the Title II Community-Based Family Resource Centers program with a new Community-Based Family Resource and Support Program, and repealed Title III.

CAPTA was most recently amended by the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-36, 6/25/03), which amended Title I and replaced Title II, Community-Based Family Resource and Support Program with Community-Based Grants for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.

CAPTA was reauthorized in 2010, as the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 2011 (Public Law 111-320)

{{homicide}}

'''Child murder''' or '''child homicide''' is the [[homicide]] of an individual who is a [[Age of majority|minor]].

== Punishment by jurisdiction ==
===United States===
In 2008, there were 1,494 child homicides in the United States. Of those killed, 1,035 were male and 452 were female.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation. (2009). Crime in the United States: Uniform Crime Report, 2008. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/offenses/expanded_information/data/shrtable_02.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819101712/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/offenses/expanded_information/data/shrtable_02.html |archivedate=2010-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several U.S. states have included child murder to their list of aggravating factors that may make a murder punishable by the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]], but the victim’s age under which the crime is a capital crime varies between them. In 2011, Texas raised this age from six to ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= AN ACT relating to the murder of a child as a capital offense. |url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/html/SB00377F.HTM |publisher= legis.state.tx.us |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child [[manslaughter]] can result in an aggravated charge in some jurisdictions such as the State of [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0700-0799/0782/Sections/0782.07.html The 2015 Florida Statutes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==By other children==
In most countries, there are very few cases where children are killed by other young children. According to the U.S. Department of Justice statistics for 1996,{{fact|date=January 2014}} one in five murders of children are committed by other children. Several murders by children have gained prominent media exposure. One was the killing on 12 February 1993 of the almost 3-year-old boy [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] by two 10-year-old boys in [[Bootle]], [[Merseyside]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. He was beaten and stoned before his unconscious body was left on train tracks to give the impression that a train had hit him. Another notable case in the UK occurred in 1968 in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], when 10-year-old [[Mary Bell]] was convicted of [[manslaughter]] due to diminished responsibility in the deaths of toddlers Martin Brown and Brian Howe. She was released in 1980 at the age of 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1110123/Child-killer-Mary-Bell-grandmother-51-But-I-left-grief-says-victims-mother.html|title = Child killer Mary Bell becomes a grandmother at 51: But all I have left is grief, says victim's mother | date = 9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, 8-year-old Madelyn Clifton was killed by 14-year-old [[Josh Phillips (murderer)|Josh Phillips]].

==Media coverage==
In 1992, after the fatal shooting of 7-year-old [[Dantrell Davis]] as he left the [[Cabrini–Green]] [[public housing]] project for school, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' put every child murder on the front page (generally no murders were front-page news). 62 child murders were reported that year.

Multiple deaths in one incident, such as the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]] and the 2012 [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], tend to gather the most media attention but are statistically scarce.

{{main|Military use of children}}
The military use of children refers to children being placed in harm's way in military actions, in order to protect a location or provide propaganda. This is sometimes referred to as child sacrifice, though not equivalent to the religious variety. It may also refer to the use of children as child soldiers or saboteurs.

[[Red Hand Day]] on 15 February is an annual commemoration day to draw public attention to the practice of using children as soldiers in wars and armed conflicts.

=="Muti killings"==
[[Medicine murder]] (often referred to as ''muti killing'') is a practice of [[human sacrifice]] and [[disfigurement|mutilation]] associated with traditional medicinal practices, such as [[Muti]]. Victims of muti killings are often children. Organs and/or body parts are usually taken while child is still alive. An unknown child (referred to as ''[[Adam (unsolved Thames murder case)|Adam]]''), whose decapitated torso was found in the [[River Thames]] in [[London]] in 2002 is believed to have been the victim of a muti killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1723795.stm | work=BBC News | title=Torso murder reward offered | date=21 December 2001 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''China–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement''' ('''CAMBA''') is a treaty between [[Australia]] and [[China]] to minimise harm to the major areas used by [[migratory bird]]s which migrate between the two countries. CAMBA was first developed on October 20, 1986 and came into force on September 1, 1988.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3184">'''Civil authority''' or '''[[civilian]] authority''', also known as '''civilian government''', is the practical implementation of a [[State (polity)|State]], other than its [[military]] units, that enforces [[law and order (politics)|law and order]]. It is also used to distinguish between religious authority (for example [[Canon law]]) and [[secular]] authority. The enforcement of law and order is typically the role of the [[police]] in modern states.

==History==
Among the first modern experiments in civil government took place in 1636 when [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], a Christian minister, founded the colony of [[Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. He sought to create a "[[Separation of church and state|wall of separation]]" between church and state to prevent corruption of the church and maintain civil order as expounded upon in his 1644 book, ''[[Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Williams, James Calvin Davis (editor), ''On religious liberty: selections from the works of Roger Williams'', (Harvard University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|0-674-02685-3}}, {{ISBN|9780674026858}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=1_iNvIgKzfsC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s](accessed July 11, 2009 on Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Emanuel Ernst, Roger Williams, ''New England Firebrand'' (Macmillan Co., Rhode Island, 1932), pg. 246 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IsgMAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=bloudy+tenent+of+persecution+vigor+style+roger+williams&amp;dq=bloudy+tenent+of+persecution+vigor+style+roger+williams&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of authority==
Thus three forms of authority may be seen:
*Civil authority
*[[Military government|Military authority]]
*Religious authority (certain constitutions exclude the state having any religious authority)

It can also mean the moral power of command, supported (when need be) by physical coercion, which the State exercises over its members.  In this view, because man can not live in isolation without being deprived of what makes him human, and because authority is necessary for a society to hold together, the authority has not only the power but the right to command.  It is natural to man to live in society, to submit to authority, and to be governed by that custom of society which crystallizes into law, and the obedience that is required is paid to the powers that be, to the authority in possession.  The extent of its authority is bound by the ends it has in view, and the extent to which it provides for the government of society.

In modern states enforcement of law and order is typically the role of the [[police]] although the line between military and civil units may be hard to distinguish; especially when [[militia]]s and volunteers, such as [[yeomanry]], act in pursuance of non-military, domestic objectives.

'''Clay''' is a finely-grained natural [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[soil]] material that combines one or more [[clay minerals]] with possible traces of [[quartz]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[metal oxide]]s ([[Aluminium oxide|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ,]] [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]] etc.) and [[organic matter]]. Geologic clay [[deposit (geology)|deposits]] are mostly composed of [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicate minerals]] containing variable amounts of [[water]] trapped in the mineral structure. Clays are [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] due to particle size and geometry as well as water content, and become hard, brittle and non–plastic upon drying or [[Pottery#Firing|firing]].&lt;ref name="guggenheim"&gt;{{harvnb|Guggenheim|Martin|1995|pp=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University College London Geology on Campus: Clays"&gt;{{cite web|title=University College London Geology on Campus: Clays |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/ucl/materials/clay |publisher=Earth Sciences department, [[University College London]]|accessdate=10 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127051002/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/ucl/materials/clay|archivedate=27 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science Learning Hub"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is clay|url=http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Ceramics/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/What-is-clay|website=Science Learning Hub|publisher=[[University of Waikato]]|accessdate=10 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103182308/http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Ceramics/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/What-is-clay|archivedate=3 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soil classification|Depending on the soil's content]] in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red.

Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. [[Silt]]s, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties.  The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. [[Geologist]]s and [[soil scientist]]s usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 [[Micrometre|µm]] (clays being finer than silts), [[sedimentologist]]s often use 4–5 μm, and [[colloid]] [[chemist]]s use 1 μm.&lt;ref name="guggenheim" /&gt; [[Geotechnical engineering|Geotechnical engineers]] distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' [[Atterberg limits]]. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 μm and silt particles as being larger.

Mixtures of [[sand]], [[silt]] and less than 40% clay are called [[loam]]. Loam makes good [[soil]] and is used as a building material.

== Formation ==
[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|Deforestation for clay extraction in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The picture is of Morro da Covanca, Jacarepaguá.]]
Clay minerals typically form over long periods of time as a result of the gradual chemical [[weathering]] of rocks, usually silicate-bearing, by low concentrations of [[carbonic acid]] and other diluted [[solvents]]. These solvents, usually acidic, migrate through the weathering rock after [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] through upper weathered layers. In addition to the weathering process, some clay minerals are formed through [[hydrothermal]] activity. There are two types of clay deposits: primary and secondary. Primary clays form as residual deposits in soil and remain at the site of formation. Secondary clays are clays that have been transported from their original location by water erosion and [[Deposition (geology)|deposited]] in a new [[sedimentary]] deposit.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/info/clays/|title=Environmental Characteristics of Clays and Clay Mineral Deposits|work=usgs.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208055734/http://pubs.usgs.gov/info/clays/|archivedate=8 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay deposits are typically associated with very low energy [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environments]] such as large lakes and marine basins.

== Grouping ==
Depending on the academic source, there are three or four main groups of clays: [[kaolin]]ite, [[montmorillonite]]-[[smectite]], [[illite]], and [[chlorite group|chlorite]]. Chlorites are not always considered to be a clay, sometimes being classified as a separate group within the [[phyllosilicate]]s. There are approximately 30 different types of "pure" clays in these categories, but most "natural" clay deposits are mixtures of these different types, along with other weathered minerals.

[[Varve]] (or ''varved clay'') is clay with visible annual layers, which are formed by seasonal deposition of those layers and are marked by differences in [[erosion]] and organic content. This type of [[deposition (geology)|deposit]] is common in former [[glacial lake]]s. When fine sediments are delivered into the calm waters of these glacial lake basins away from the shoreline, they settle to the lake bed. The resulting seasonal layering is preserved in an even distribution of clay sediment banding.&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt;

[[Quick clay]] is a unique type of [[marine clay]] indigenous to the glaciated terrains of [[Norway]], [[Canada]], [[Northern Ireland]], and [[Sweden]]. It is a highly sensitive clay, prone to [[Soil liquefaction|liquefaction]], which has been involved in several deadly [[landslide]]s.

Clays exhibit [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] when mixed with water in certain proportions. However, when dry, clay becomes firm and when [[pottery firing|fired]] in a [[kiln]], permanent physical and chemical changes occur. These changes convert the clay into a [[ceramic]] material. Because of these properties, clay is used for making [[pottery]], both utilitarian and decorative, and construction products, such as bricks, wall and floor tiles. Different types of clay, when used with different [[mineral]]s and firing conditions, are used to produce [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]], and [[porcelain]]. [[Prehistoric]] humans discovered the useful properties of clay. Some of the earliest pottery shards recovered are from central [[Honshu]], [[Japan]]. They are associated with the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]] culture and deposits they were recovered from have been [[radiocarbon dating|dated]] to around 14,000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, C. 2005.

Purpose-made clay balls were also used as [[sling (weapon)#Ammunition|sling ammunition]].

Clays [[sintering|sintered]] in fire were the first form of [[ceramic]]. [[Brick]]s, cooking pots, art objects, [[dishware]], [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipes]], and even [[musical instrument]]s such as the [[ocarina]] can all be shaped from clay before being fired. Clay is also used in many industrial processes, such as [[paper]] making, [[cement]] production, and chemical [[filter (chemistry)|filtering]]. Until the late 20th century, [[bentonite]] clay was widely used as a mold binder in the manufacture of [[sand casting]]s.

Clay, being relatively [[permeability (fluid)|impermeable]] to water, is also used where natural seals are needed, such as in the cores of [[dam]]s, or as a barrier in [[landfill]]s against toxic seepage (lining the landfill, preferably in combination with [[geotextile]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Koçkar, Mustafa K.; Akgün, Haluk; Aktürk, Özgür, [http://www2.widener.edu/~sxw0004/abstract34.html ''Preliminary evaluation of a compacted bentonite / sand mixture as a landfill liner material'' (Abstract)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204075553/http://www2.widener.edu/~sxw0004/abstract34.html |date=4 December 2008 }}.

Clay as the defining ingredient of [[loam]] is one of the oldest building materials on [[Earth]], among other ancient, naturally-occurring geologic materials such as [[stone]] and organic materials like [[wood]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grim|first1=Ralph|title=Clay mineral|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/clay-mineral|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=10 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209182021/http://www.britannica.com/science/clay-mineral|archivedate=9 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population, in both traditional societies as well as developed countries, still live or work in buildings made with clay, often baked into [[brick]], as an essential part of its load-bearing structure. Also a primary ingredient in many [[natural building]] techniques, clay is used to create [[adobe]], [[cob (material)|cob]], [[cordwood]], and [[rammed earth]] structures and building elements such as [[wattle and daub]], clay plaster, clay render case, clay floors and clay [[paints]] and [[ceramic building material]]. Clay was used as a [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in brick [[chimneys]] and stone walls where protected from water.

[[Image:Cebhomes.jpg|thumb|Building a CEB project in Midland, Texas in August 2006]]
A '''compressed earth block''' ('''CEB'''), also known as a ''pressed earth block'' or a ''compressed soil block'', is a [[building material]] made primarily from damp [[soil]] compressed at high pressure to form blocks. Compressed earth blocks use a mechanical press to form blocks out of an appropriate mix of fairly dry inorganic [[subsoil]], non-expansive [[clay]] and [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]. If the blocks are stabilized with a chemical binder such as [[Portland cement]] they are called ''compressed stabilized earth block'' (CSEB) or ''stabilized earth block'' (SEB). Typically, around {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} is applied in compression, and the original soil volume is reduced by about half.

Creating CEBs differs from [[rammed earth]] in that the latter uses a larger formwork into which earth is poured and manually tamped down, creating larger forms such as a whole wall or more at one time rather than building blocks. CEBs differ from [[mud brick]]s in that the latter are not compressed and solidify through chemical changes that take place as they air dry. The compression strength of properly made CEB can meet or exceed that of typical cement or mud brick. Building standards have been developed for CEB.

CEBs are assembled onto walls using standard [[bricklaying]] and [[masonry]] techniques. The [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] may be a simple [[slurry]] made of the same soil/clay mix without aggregate, spread or brushed very thinly between the blocks for bonding, or cement mortar may also be used for high strength, or when construction during freeze-thaw cycles causes stability issues. [[Hydraform block]]s are shaped to be interlocking.

==Development==
CEB technology has been developed  for low-cost construction, as an alternative to adobe, and with some advantages.  A commercial industry has been advanced by eco-friendly contractors, manufacturers of the mechanical presses, and by cultural acceptance of the method.  In the [[United States]], most general contractors building with CEB are in the Southwestern states: [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], and to a lesser extent in [[Texas]].  The methods and presses have been used for many years in [[Mexico]], and in [[developing countries]].

The [[South Africa]]n Department of Water Affairs and Forestry considers that CEB, locally called "'''Dutch brick'''" is an appropriate technology for a developing country, as are adobe, rammed earth and cob. All use natural building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=6|url=http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Masibambane/documents/civil/CrossCuttingFeb08.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Critical Sustainability Pillars for service delivery in the Water Sector|publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, South Africa|date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 the International Institute for Energy Conservation was one of the winners of a [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award]] for a project to make an energy-efficient Dutch brick-making machine for home construction in South Africa. By making cheaper bricks that use earth, the project would reduce housing costs while stimulating the building industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/29725/south-africa-poverty-reduction-winners|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=SOUTH AFRICA: Poverty reduction winners|publisher=IRIN|date=11 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The machine would be mobile, allowing bricks to be made locally from earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbdm/idea/housing-and-jobs-better-future|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Housing and Jobs for a Better Future|publisher=[[World Bank]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of CEB production machines exist, from manual to semi-automated and fully automated,  with increasing capital-investment and production rates, and decreased labor.  Automated machines are more common in the developed world, and manual machines in the developing world.

==Advantages==
There are many advantages of the CEB system.   On-site materials can be used, which reduces cost, minimizes shipping costs for materials, and increases efficiency and sustainability.  The wait-time required to obtain materials is minimal, because after the blocks are pressed, materials are available very soon after a short drying period.  The uniformity of the blocks simplifies construction, and minimizes or eliminates the need for mortar, thus reducing both the labor and materials costs.  The blocks are strong, stable, water-resistant and long-lasting.
* CEB can be pressed from damp earth. Because it is not wet, the drying time is much shorter. Some soil conditions permit the blocks to go straight from the press onto the wall. A single mechanical press can produce from 800 to over 5,000 blocks per day, enough to build a {{convert|1200|sqft|m2}} house in one day.   A high performance CEB press, of [[open source]] design, named "The Liberator", can produce from 8,000 to 17,000 or more blocks per day.  The production rate is limited more by the ability to get material into the machine, than the machine itself.
* Shipping cost: Suitable soils are often available at or near the construction site. [[Adobe]] and CEB are of similar weight, but distance from a source supply gives CEB an advantage.  Also, CEB can be made available in places where adobe manufacturing operations are non-existent.
* Uniformity: CEB can be manufactured to a predictable size and has true flat sides and 90-degree angle edges.  This makes design and costing easier.  This also provides the contractor the option of making the exteriors look like conventional [[stucco]] houses. 
* Presses allow blocks to be consistently made of uniform size, while also obtaining strengths that exceed the ASTM standard for concrete blocks (1900 psi).
* Non-toxic:  materials are completely natural, non-toxic, and do not out-gas
* Sound resistant:  an important feature in high-density neighborhoods, residential areas adjacent to industrial zones
* Fire resistant:  earthen walls do not burn
* Insect resistant: Insects are discouraged because the walls are solid and very dense, and have no food value
* [[Mold]] resistant:  there is no cellulose material - such as in wood, [[Oriented Strand Board]] or [[drywall]] - that can host [[mold]] or rot
* In India, CSEB's with cement stabilization have shown to be very beneficial. The observed compressive strength, flexural strength at 28 days of aging with 9% cement stabilization has been observed to be 3.2 MPa and 1 MPa respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267637559|accessdate=2014-11-11|title=Effect Of Varying Cement Proportions On Properties Of Compressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEB) - A Sustainable Low-Cost Housing Material|publisher=DOI: 10.13140/2.1.4966.4963 Conference: International Conference on Sustainable Civil Infrastructure, ASCE India Section 17–18 October 2014, At Hyderabad, India, Volume: pg 1000-1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presses==
CEB had very limited use prior to the 1980s. It was known in the 1950s in [[South America]], where one of the most well-known presses, the [[Cinva Ram]], was developed by Raul Ramirez in the Inter-American Housing Center (CINVA) in Bogota, Colombia.  The Cinva Ram is a single-block, manual-press that uses a long, hand-operated lever to drive a [[cam]], generating high pressure.

Industrial manufacturers produce much larger machines that run with diesel or gasoline engines and hydraulic presses that receive the soil/aggregate mixture through a hopper. This is fed into a chamber to create a block that is then ejected onto a conveyor.

During the 1980s, soil-pressing technology became widespread. [[France]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[South Africa]] and [[Switzerland]] began to write standards. The [[Peace Corps]], [[USAID]], [[Habitat for Humanity]] and other programs began to implement it into housing projects.

==Finishing==
Completed walls require either a reinforced bond beam or a ring beam on top or between floors and if the blocks are not stabilized, a plaster finish, usually stucco wire/stucco cement and/or lime plaster. Stabilized blocks can be left exposed with no outer plaster finish. In tropical environments, polycarbonate varnish is often used to provide an additional layer of wet-weather protection.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Foundations==
Standards for foundations are similar to those for brick walls. A CEB wall is heavy. Footings must be at least 10&amp;nbsp;inches thick, with a minimum width that is 33 percent greater than the wall width. If a stem wall is used, it shall extend to an elevation not less than eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  above the exterior finish grade. Rubble-filled foundation trench designs with a reinforced concrete grade beam above are allowed to support CEB construction.

==Strength==
Using the [[ASTM]] D1633-00 stabilization standard, a pressed and cured block must be submerged in water for four hours. It is then pulled from the water and immediately subjected to a compression test. The blocks must score at least a 300 [[pound-force per square inch]] (p.s.i) (2 MPa) minimum.  This is a higher standard than for adobe, which must score an ''average'' of at least 300 p.s.i. (2 MPa)

'''Conduit OFC''' and '''Sink OFC''' is an empirical quantitative method of classifying [[corporate tax haven]]s, [[offshore financial centres]] and [[tax havens]].&lt;ref name="guar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/25/netherlands-and-uk-are-biggest-channels-for-corporate-tax-avoidance|title=Netherlands and UK are biggest channels for corporate tax avoidance|publisher=The Guardian|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-31/is-the-u-k-already-the-kind-of-tax-haven-it-claims-it-won-t-be|title=Is the U.K. Already the Kind of Tax Haven It Claims It Won't Be?|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloom2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-11/tax-havens-can-be-surprisingly-close-to-home|title=Tax Havens Can Be Surprisingly Close to Home|publisher=Bloomberg View|date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than analyzing taxation and legal structures to identify and classify potential tax havens (the preferred EU, IMF, and OECD route), this approach analyses the ownership chains of 98 million global companies (a purely empirical, or outcomes–based, route), relative to the size of countries of their incorporation.  The technique gives both a method of classification and a method of understanding the relative scale of corporate tax havens/offshore financial centers.

The results were formally published by the University of Amsterdam's CORPNET Group in July 2017, and identify two major classifications:

*  24 global Sink OFCs: jurisdictions in which a disproportional amount of value disappears from the economic system (i.e. the traditional [[tax havens]]).&lt;br&gt;(See the table below for the list of Sinks)
*  5 global Conduit OFCs: jurisdictions through which a disproportional amount of value moves toward sink OFCs (i.e. modern [[corporate tax haven]]s).&lt;br&gt;(Conduits are: Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Singapore and Ireland)

A key difference between the lists regards the major corporate tax havens (or offshore financial centres), like Ireland the Netherlands and Luxembourg (amongst others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caymancompass.com/2017/08/01/new-study-offers-more-nuanced-look-at-offshore-finance/|title=New study offers more nuanced look at offshore finance| publisher=Cayman Compass | date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major regulators like the EU and the OECD don't regard them as tax havens, and point to their transparency and compliance with international regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/there-is-a-definition-of-a-tax-haven-and-ireland-doesnt-make-that-grade-35095264.html|title=There is a definition of a tax haven - and Ireland doesn't make that grade|publisher=Irish Independent|date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/oced-ireland-tax-haven-1005122-Jul2013/|title=OECD tax chief: 'Ireland is not a tax haven'|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/140279|title=EU countries are not 'tax havens', parliament says|publisher=EU Observer|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nltimes.nl/2017/12/06/eu-releases-tax-haven-blacklist-netherlands|title=EU RELEASES TAX HAVEN BLACKLIST; NETHERLANDS NOT ON IT|publisher=NL Times|date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was the result of a multi–year investigation by political economists and computer scientists in the CORPNET research group at the University of Amsterdam.

The report used the Moody's [[Bureau van Dijk|Orbis corporate database]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bvdinfo.com/en-us/blog/transfer-pricing/-uncovering-offshore-financial-centers-conduits-a| title='Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network' - and how Orbis helped|publisher=Moodys BUREAU VAN DIJK|date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to examine 98 million global companies and their 71 million ownership connections (using [[big data]] computer modelling) to identify 5 global Conduit OFCs (Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore and Switzerland). These are countries of high financial reputation (i.e. not formally labelled "tax havens" by OECD/EU), but who have "advanced" legal and tax structuring vehicles (and SPVs) that help legally route funds to the 24 tax havens (called Sink OFCs), without incurring tax in the Conduit OFC (or even tax in the source of funds location, where [[royalty payment]] schemes can be used).&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tjn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/07/25/new-research-key-role-major-economies-play-global-tax-avoidance/| title=New research on key role major economies play in global tax avoidance|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/these-five-countries-are-conduits-for-the-worlds-biggest-tax-havens-79555| title=These five countries are conduits for the world’s biggest tax havens|publisher=theconversation.com|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work builds on methods established in the "Offshore–Intensity Ratio",&lt;ref name="fir"/&gt; and in particular the understanding activity relative to the scale of the domestic economy in a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corpnet.uva.nl/apple-multinationals-avoid-taxes-accountability-network-study-offshore-finance/| title=How Apple and Other Multinationals Avoid Taxes and Accountability: A Network Study of Offshore Finance|publisher=CORPNET|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At its crudest level, the Offshore-Intensity Ratio explains why the countries at the top of global [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]] lists are mostly [[tax haven]] types.

The EU Parliament's Policy Department on Economic and Scientific Policies included the research in its findings for the EU Committee on Money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion (PANA),&lt;ref name="pana1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eppgroup.eu/PANA| title=PANA Committee on Money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion|publisher=EU Parliament|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by tabulating against existing EU–IMF–FSI tax–haven lists, showed material gaps in EU understanding of conduits.&lt;ref name="pana2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/115250/PANA%202016-04%20ST%20Offshore%20activities%20Final.pdf| title=Offshore activities and money laundering: recent findings and challenges|page=39|publisher=EU Parliament|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CORPNET's top 5 Conduits and top 5 Sinks are 9 of the 10 largest tax havens identified in 2010 by one of the academic founders of tax haven research, [[James R. Hines Jr.]].  Hines' 2010 list of [[James R.

==Conduit OFC==
{{see also|Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy}}

Conduit OFCs are described as having advanced legal and tax systems designed to enable corporations to route funds from high tax locations (e.g. Germany) to the Sink OFCs (e.g. Bermuda). They tend to have attractive "holding company" regimes (e.g. no withholding taxes, foreign dividends exempt from taxes, capital gains reliefs, full double–tax relief), advanced tax treatment of intellectual property regimes, and large global networks of bilateral [[tax treaties]].&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/these-five-countries-are-conduits-for-the-worlds-biggest_us_5975f0aee4b0f1feb89b4500| title=These Five Countries Are Conduits For The World’s Biggest Tax Havens|publisher=Huffington Post| date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ft1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ft.com/content/b83e697a-c625-11e7-b2bb-322b2cb39656| title=Stranger than paradise: the truth about tax|publisher=Financial Times| date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CORPNET's five major Conduit OFCs, all have a top–ten ranking in the 2018 ''[[Global Intellectual Property Center|Global Innovation Property Centre]] (GIPC) IP Index''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GIPC_IP_Index_2018.pdf|title=GIPC IP Index 2018|date=February 2018|author=[[United States Chamber of Commerce]]|quote=Figure I: U.S. Chamber International IP Index 2018, Overall Scores|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IP has been described as the "raw materials of corporate tax avoidance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bnrbeurs.nl/2017/02/22/the-corporate-tax-avoidance-toolbox/| title=The Corporate Tax Avoidance Toolbox|publisher=B&amp;R Beurs|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the leading corporate tax avoidance vehicle".&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/62-1-1.pdf | title=Intellectual Property Law Solutions to Tax Avoidance | author=Andrew Blair-Stanek|quote=Intellectual property (IP) has become the leading tax-avoidance vehicle.| publisher=UCLA Law Review |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fordam"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordhamiplj.org/2016/08/30/ip-tax-avoidance-ireland/ | title=Intellectual Property and Tax Avoidance in Ireland | publisher=[[Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal]] | date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conduit OFCs tend to be dominated by major law firms and global accounting firms, who create the lawfully constructed vehicles that make the Sink OFC connections, by exploiting legislative [[loopholes]] such as the [[double Irish]] and [[dutch sandwich]]. They advise clients (and the Government) on anticipating future changes (e.g. from OECD BEPS processes), that may need new loopholes.&lt;ref name="apple"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html|title=After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits|publisher=New York Times|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt;  They write most of the State's relevant SPV legislation (where they create the new loopholes) through detailed lobbying and representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/matheson-lobbied-oecd-to-dilute-proposed-tax-rules-1.2601058?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fmatheson-lobbied-oecd-to-dilute-proposed-tax-rules-1.2601058| title=Law firm Matheson lobbied OECD to dilute proposed tax rules|publisher=Irish Times | date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ie/Documents/Tax/ie-Tax-Coffey-Review-Public-Consultation-Paper.pdf| title=Consultation Paper on Review of Ireland’s Corporation Tax Code|publisher=Deloitte| date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-needs-to-stay-ahead-of-the-corporate-tax-reform-game-1.3218774?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fireland-needs-to-stay-ahead-of-the-corporate-tax-reform-game-1.3218774| title=Ireland needs to stay ahead of the corporate tax reform game|publisher=Irish Times| date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ft1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.somo.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tax-games-the-race-to-the-bottom.pdf| title=Tax Games|publisher=EURODAD|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of legal and tax structuring is considered beyond the trust–structuring type work of the [[offshore magic circle]] firms.  Conduit OFCs need structures that can integrate with bilateral tax treaties involving G20 countries, as well as meeting U.S. GAAP / SEC Regulations that U.S. multinationals (one of the largest users of Conduit OFCs) need to adhere to.

These top 5 global Conduit OFCs channel 47% of corporate offshore connections and have different attributes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uva.nl/en/content/news/press-releases/2017/07/highly-developed-countries-canalise-almost-50-of-equity-flows-to-tax-havens.html| title=Highly developed countries canalise almost 50% of equity flows to tax havens|publisher=CORPNET| date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sink OFC==
[[File:List of sink-OFCs, ordered by sink centrality value.png|thumb|"Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers": List of Sink OFCs ordered by value (showing U.K. dependencies)]]

Sink OFCs cover a broad range of locations from very small counties (e.g. the Marshall Islands), to major global [[financial centres]] (e.g. Hong Kong).

Just because funds reach a Sink OFC, does not mean that they remain dormant.  Quite the contrary, the funds can be invested in assets all over the world, but their legal ownership and future gains remain in the Sink OFC.  For example, the circa $1 trillion of US company offshore cash, is held in Sink OFCs (esp. Caribbean).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-real-story-behind-us-companies-off-shore-cash-reserves| title=The real story behind US companies' offshore cash reserves | publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/20/us-corporate-giants-hoarding-over-a-trillion-dollars-apple-microsoft-google| title=US corporate giants hoarding more than a trillion dollars | work=The Guardian | date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report highlighted some interesting aspects of the 24 Sink OFCs:
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
| British Virgin Islands – in terms of connections, is the "Netherlands of Sink OFCs" and heavily linked with the Conduit OFC United Kingdom.
| Luxembourg and Hong Kong – would have been considered Conduit OFCs, but the research shows they are even bigger Sink OFCs (i.e. longer–term homes for funds), Luxembourg (for routing funds from high–tax EU countries) and Hong Kong (for routing funds out of China)
| Jersey – remains a unique link with major Conduit OFC, Switzerland (because the study could not capture individual "trusts", Jersey could be understated).
| Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Triad – these three classic offshore tax havens are heavily interlinked and starting to present as one large Sink OFC.
| Taiwan – has been a controversial entrant on several tax haven lists (the [[Tax Justice Network]] calls Taiwan the "Switzerland of Asia",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2016/02/10/taiwan-the-un-noticed-asian-tax-haven/|title=Taiwan, the un–noticed Asian tax haven?|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Taiwan is not on any EU/OECD/IMF tax-haven list), and is identified as the 2nd largest Asian Sink OFC.

CORPNET highlighted the lack of progress the OECD [[Base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") project is making, and that the OECD's support of transparent [[intellectual property]]–based tax structuring (or patent/knowledge boxes), is incompatible with the emerging position of intellectual property as the leading [[BEPS]] tool in conduit OFCs.&lt;ref name="un1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/09/11/new-un-tax-handbook-sets-lower-income-countries-oecd-beps/|title=New UN tax handbook: Lower–income countries vs OECD BEPS failure|publisher=Tax Justice Network| date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reasons for this failure are discussed in [[Corporate haven#Failure of OECD BEPS Project|failure of OECD BEPS Project]].

An example of an IP–based [[Base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS tool]] is Ireland's [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|capital allowances for intangible assets]] ("CAIA") tool, also known as the "[[Ireland as a tax haven#Green Jersey|Green Jersey]]", which has an [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rate]] of 0–3%.  Apple used the CAIA (or Green Jersey) BEPS tool in Q1 2015 (and created the noted Irish "[[leprechaun economics]]" restatement of GDP).  Ireland has other IP–based [[Base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS tools]] (Ireland as the first OECD nexus-compliant [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Knowledge development box|KDB]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/oecd-gives-cautious-welcome-to-knowledge-box-tax-scheme-30685281.html|title=OECD gives cautious welcome to Irish Knowledge Box tax scheme|publisher=Irish Independent|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a supporter of the [[Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)|OECD BEPS project]] (see box).

The Chief Minister of the IOM, [[Howard Quayle]], announced that the CORPNET report proved that the IOM is not a tax haven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/article.cfm?id=35167&amp;headline=We%27re%20no%20tax%20haven%20study%20concludes&amp;sectionIs=news&amp;searchyear=2017| title=We're no tax haven study concludes | publisher=IOM Today | date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://business-reporter.co.uk/2017/11/07/isle-man-closely-mirrors-uk-rules-says-chief-minister/?getcat=2934| title=Isle of man ‘closely mirrors’ UK rules, says Chief Minister| publisher=Daily Telegraph Business Reporter | date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, CORPNET researchers from the University of Amsterdam directly replied to Howard Quayle's article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corpnet.uva.nl/response-to-howard-quayle-chief-minister-of-isle-of-man/| title=Response to Howard Quayle, Chief Minister of Isle of Man| publisher=CORPNET| date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifying that while the IOM does not appear as a leading Sink OFC for corporate tax avoidance, it does not mean that individuals (personal bank accounts and trusts) do not use the IOM to avoid taxes, and particularly United Kingdom VAT.

Other commentators have added that the IOM is "failing as a tax haven", and is now too small to appear in major studies like the CORPNET research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2017/08/02/the-isle-of-man-is-failing-at-being-a-tax-haven/| title=The Isle of Man is failing at being a tax haven| publisher=Tax Research UK| date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CORPNET report uses corporate connections on the [[Bureau van Dijk|Orbis database]], rather than the quantum of money, as its primary metric of analysis.  In theory, the authors feel that this does not impede the goal of classification, and of making relative rankings.  However, it does mean the amount of potential tax avoidance is ignored.&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt;

Acclaimed author on tax havens and offshore financial centers, [[Gabriel Zucman]], uses a different quantitative approach.  Zucman focuses on macro–data of national statistical accounts.  In theory, the total assets in a system should equal the total liabilities.  By aggregating national account data, Zucman can identify an excess of liabilities over assets, implying that the missing assets (to balance the equation), are hidden in tax–havens.  On this basis, in 2015, he estimated that 8% of the world's wealth (or $7.6 trillion) was "missing" in offshore tax–havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/opinion/a-piketty-proteges-theory-on-tax-havens.html|title=The True Cost of Hidden Money|publisher=New York Times |date=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zucman's analysis highlights the special case of Ireland and why the Orbis database underestimates Ireland's scale as one of the world's largest corporate tax avoidance, or [[base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS]], hubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/tax-havens-dodging-theft-multinationals-avoiding-tax|title=The desperate inequality behind global tax dodging|publisher=The Guardian| date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US multinationals dominate Ireland's economy, using it as a shield from the US "worldwide tax" system (pre 2017 [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|TCJA]] leglislation).&lt;ref name="her"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Territorial Tax System Would Create Jobs and Raise Wages for U.S. Workers|url = https://www.heritage.org/taxes/report/territorial-tax-system-would-create-jobs-and-raise-wages-us-workers|publisher = The Heritage Foundation|date = 12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are 14 of Ireland's 20 largest firms,&lt;ref name="itimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top1000.ie/companies| title=Ireland's Top 1000 Companies | publisher=Irish Times| date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; directly employ one–quarter of the labour force,&lt;ref name="oecdx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/investment/IRELAND-trade-investment-statistical-country-note.pdf|title=IRELAND Trade and Statistical Note 2017|publisher=OECD|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; pay 80% of all business taxes,&lt;ref name="ctx1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/research/corporation-tax-returns-2016.pdf|title=An Analysis of 2015 Corporation Tax Returns and 2016 Payments|publisher=Revenue Commissioners|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and create 57% of non–farm private sector OECD value–add.&lt;ref name="oecdx"/&gt; There are no non–US/non–UK foreign firms in Ireland's top 50 firms by turnover (and only one by employees, Lidl).&lt;ref name="itimes"/&gt; When Apple restructured its Irish subsidiaries in January 2015, it caused Irish GDP to rise 26.3% and Irish GNP to rise 18.7% (became the [[leprechaun economics]] affair).

Zucman's analysis shows many of Ireland's US multinationals don't appear on Orbis (Facebook), or only have a small fraction of their data on Orbis (Google and Apple).  Analysed using "quantum of funds" (not "Orbis connections"), Zucman shows Ireland is one of the largest corporate tax shelters in the world, and a route for Zucman’s estimated loss of 20% in EU corporate tax revenues annually.&lt;ref name="zuc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/TWZ2018Slides.pdf|page=35|title=The Missing Profits of Nations|author=[[Gabriel Zucman]]|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]], Working Papers| date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporations-push-profits-into-tax-havens-as-countries-struggle-in-pursuit-study-says-1528634659|title=Zucman:Corporations Push Profits Into Corporate Tax Havens as Countries Struggle in Pursuit, Gabrial Zucman Study Says|quote=The new research draws on data from countries such as Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands that hadn’t previously been collected.|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Legend|#008066|Continental System}}]]
The '''Continental System''' or '''Continental Blockade''' (known in French as ''Blocus continental'') was the [[foreign policy]] of [[Napoleon|Napoleon I of France]] against the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. As a response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on 16 May 1806, Napoleon issued the [[Berlin Decree]] on 21 November 1806, which brought into effect a large-scale embargo against British trade.&lt;ref name="HeidlerHeidler2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Stephen Heidler|author2=Jteanne T. Heidler|title=Encyclopedia of the War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_c09EJgek50C&amp;pg=PA48|year= 2004|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-59114-362-8|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Napoléon, Hachette 2008, p.207"&gt;[[Jean Tulard]], ''Napoléon'', Hachette, 2008, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The embargo was applied intermittently, ending on 11 April 1814 after Napoleon's first abdication. The blockade caused little economic damage to the UK, although British exports to the continent (as a proportion of the UK's total trade) dropped from 55% to 25% between 1802 and 1806.&lt;ref name = "Histoire et dictionnaire du Consulat et de l'Empire"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Alfred Fierro|author2=André Palluel-Guillard|author3=Jean Tulard|title=Histoire et dictionnaire du Consulat et de l'Empire|publisher=Robert Laffont|isbn=2-221-05858-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Napoleon realized that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, he invaded those two countries. His forces were tied down in Spain—in which the [[Spanish War of Independence]] was occurring simultaneously—and suffered severely in, and ultimately retreated from, Russia in 1812.

The Berlin Decree forbade the import of British goods into any European countries allied with or dependent upon France, and it installed the Continental System in Europe. All connections with Britain were to be cut, even the mail.  British merchants smuggled in many goods and the Continental System was not a powerful weapon of economic war.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics 1763–1858'' (1999) pp. 305–10&lt;/ref&gt; There was some damage to British trade, especially in 1808 and 1812, but British control of the oceans led to replacement trade with North and South America, as well as large scale smuggling in Europe.
The loss of Britain as a trading partner also hit the economies of France and its allies.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp. 29–33&lt;/ref&gt;  Angry governments gained an incentive to ignore the Continental System, which led to the weakening of Napoleon's coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Crouzet]], "Wars, blockade, and economic change in Europe, 1792–1815." ''[[Journal of Economic History]]'' (1964) 24#4 pp. 567–88 {{JSTOR|2115762}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The United Kingdom was the central important force in [[Golden Cavalry of St George|encouraging and financing]] alliances against Napoleonic France. In addition, the British government enacted a naval blockade of the French and French-allied coasts, on 16 May 1806. As France lacked the naval strength to invade Britain or to decisively defeat the [[Royal Navy]] at sea, Napoleon resorted instead to economic warfare. Britain was Europe's manufacturing and business center as a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Napoleon believed it would be easy to take advantage of an embargo on trade with the European nations under his control, causing inflation and great debt to undermine the British strength.

In November 1806, having recently conquered or allied with every major power on the [[Continental Europe|European continent]], [[Napoleon]], in retaliation to the British [[Order-in-Council]] of 17 May 1806 blockading all ports from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to the [[Elbe]], issued the [[Berlin Decree]] forbidding his allies and conquests from trading with the British.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_continental.html&lt;/ref&gt; The UK responded with further [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders in Council]] issued on 10 January and 11 November 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Holberg, Tom. [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/british/decrees/c_britdecrees1.html The Acts, Orders in Council, &amp;c. of Great Britain (on Trade), 1793–1812]&lt;/ref&gt; These forbade French trade with the UK, its allies or neutrals, and instructed the Royal Navy to blockade all French and allied ports, and to prevent all shipping whether neutral or not. Napoleon responded again with the [[Milan Decree]] of 1807, declaring that all neutral shipping using British ports or paying British tariffs were to be regarded as British and seized.

Napoleon's plan to defeat Britain was to destroy its ability to trade. As an island nation, trade was its most vital lifeline. Napoleon believed that if he could isolate Britain economically, he would be able to invade the nation after its economic collapse. Napoleon decreed that all commerce ships wishing to do business in Europe must first stop at a French port in order to ensure that there could be no trade with Britain. He also ordered all European nations and French allies to stop trading with Britain, and he threatened Russia with an invasion if they did not comply as well. His orders backfired in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in Portugal (being allied to Britain), setting off the [[Peninsular War]]. He pushed Russia too hard, both in terms of the Continental System, and in his demands for control over part of Poland. His attempted punishment of Russia through a massive invasion 1812 was one of the famous military disasters in world history, and set the stage for Napoleon's final downfall.

==Effects==

===United Kingdom===
The embargo encouraged British merchants to seek out new markets aggressively and to engage in smuggling with continental Europe. Napoleon's exclusively land-based customs enforcers could not stop British smugglers, especially as these operated with the connivance of Napoleon's chosen rulers of Spain, [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and other [[List of historic states of Germany|German states]].
The System had mixed effects on British trade, with British exports to the Continent falling between 25% to 55% compared to pre-1806 levels.  However, trade sharply increased with the rest of the world, covering much of the decline.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Thompson, ''Napoleon Bonaparte: His rise and fall'' (1951) pp. 235–40&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:USS Constitution vs Guerriere.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Constitution}} defeats {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}} in the 1812 war]]
Britain, by [[Orders in Council (1807)]], prohibited its trade partners from trading with France. The British countered the Continental system by threatening to sink any ship that did not come to a British port or chose to comply with France. This double threat created a difficult time for neutral nations like the United States. In response to this prohibition, compounded by the [[Chesapeake Incident]], the U.S. government adopted the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] and eventually [[Macon's Bill No. 2]]. This embargo was designed as an economic counterattack to hurt Britain, but it proved even more damaging to American merchants. Together with the issues of the [[impressment]] of foreign seamen, and British support for Indian raids in the American west, tensions led to a declaration of war by the U.S. in the [[War of 1812]]. This war, not Napoleon's blockade, sharply reduced British trade with the United States.

===France and Continental Europe===
The embargo also affected France itself. Shipbuilding, and its trades such as rope-making, declined, as did many other industries that relied on overseas markets, such as the linen industries. With few exports and lost profits, many industries were closed down. Southern France, especially the port cities of [[Marseille]] and [[Bordeaux]], as well as the city of [[La Rochelle]], suffered from the reduction in trade. Moreover, the prices of staple foods rose in most of continental Europe.

Napoleon's St. Cloud Decree in July 1810 opened the southwest of France and the Spanish frontier to limited British trade, and reopened French trade to the United States. It was an admission that his blockade had hurt his own economy more than the British. It had also failed to reduce British financial support for its allies.&lt;ref&gt;Eric A. Arnold, Jr. "Napoleon's St. Cloud Decree, 3 July 1810: Text and Analysis," ''Proceedings of the Western Society for French History'' (1998), Vol. 25, pp. 49–54&lt;/ref&gt; The industrialized north and east of France, and [[Wallonia]] (the south of today's Belgium) saw significantly increased profits due to the lack of competition from British goods (particularly textiles, which were produced much more cheaply in Britain).

In Italy, the agricultural sector flourished;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Grab and Charles F. Delzell, "The Kingdom of Italy and Napoleon's Continental Blockade," ''Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750–1850: Proceedings'' (1988), Vol. 18, pp. 587–604.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Dutch economy, predicated on trade, suffered greatly as a result of the embargo. Napoleon's economic warfare was much to the chagrin of his own brother, [[Louis Bonaparte|King Louis I]] of [[List of monarchs of the Netherlands|Holland]].

===Scandinavia and the Baltic region===
[[File:Vice-Admiral James Saumarez.jpg|thumb|Vice-Admiral James Saumarez was the commander of the Royal Navy in the Baltic campaign of 1808–1814 that secured British trade to the region]]Britain's first response to the Continental system was to launch a major naval attack on the weakest link in Napoleon's coalition, Denmark. Although ostensibly neutral, Denmark was under heavy French and Russian pressure to pledge its fleet to Napoleon. London could not take the chance of ignoring the Danish threat. In the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Second battle of Copenhagen]] in August–September 1807, the Royal Navy bombarded Copenhagen, seized the Danish fleet, and assured control of the sea lanes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea for the British merchant fleet.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Ryan, "The Causes of the British Attack upon Copenhagen in 1807." ''English Historical Review'' (1953): 37–55. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/555118 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munch-Petersen, ''Defying Napoleon: How Britain Bombarded Copenhagen and Seized the Danish Fleet in 1807'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The island of [[Heligoland#19th century|Heligoland]] off the west coast of Denmark was occupied in September 1807. This base made it easier for Britain to control trade to North Sea ports and to facilitate smuggling. The attacks against Copenhagen and Heligoland started the [[Gunboat War]] against Denmark, which lasted until 1814.

Sweden, Britain's ally in the [[Third Coalition]], refused to comply with French demands and was attacked by [[Finnish War|Russia]] in February and by [[Dano-Swedish War of 1808–09|Denmark/Norway]] in March 1808. At the same time, a French force threatened to invade southern Sweden, but the plan was stopped as the Royal Navy controlled the Danish straits. The Royal Navy set up a base outside the port of [[Gothenburg]] in 1808 to simplify operations into the Baltic Sea. The Baltic campaign was under the command of admiral [[James Saumarez]]. In November 1810 France demanded that Sweden should declare war upon the United Kingdom and stop all trade. The result was a [[Anglo-Swedish War (1810–12)|phoney war between Sweden and Britain]]. A second navy base was set up on the island of [[Hano (island)|Hanö]] in the south of Sweden in 1810. These two bases were used to support convoys from Britain to Gothenburg, then through the [[Danish straits]] to Hanö. From Hanö the goods were smuggled to the many ports around the Baltic Sea. To further support the convoys, the small Danish island of [[Anholt (Denmark)#British occupation|Anholt]] was occupied in May 1809. A lighthouse on the island simplified navigation through the Danish straits.

[[Russian Empire|Russia]] also chafed under the embargo, and in 1810 reopened trade with Britain. Russia's withdrawal from the system was a motivating factor behind Napoleon's decision to [[French invasion of Russia|invade Russia in 1812]], which proved the turning point of the war.

===Portugal and Spain===
Portugal openly refused to join the Continental System. In 1793, Portugal signed a treaty of mutual assistance with Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Portugal|author2=José Ferreira Borges de Castro (Visconde de)|author3=Julio Firmino Judice Biker|agency=Portugal. Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros|title=Supplemeto á Collecção dos tratados, convenções, contratos e actos publicos celebrados entre a corôa de Portugal e as mais potencias desde 1640|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9VVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA19|year=1857|publisher=Imprensa nacional|pages=19–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]] of July 1807, Napoleon attempted to capture the Portuguese Fleet and the [[House of Braganza]], and to occupy the Portuguese ports. He failed, as king [[John VI of Portugal]] took his fleet and [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|transferred the Portuguese Court]] to Brazil with a Royal Navy escort. The Portuguese population rose in revolt against the French invaders, with the help of the [[British Army]] under Arthur Wellesley, later [[1st Duke of Wellington]]. Napoleon intervened, and the [[Peninsular War]] began in 1808. Napoleon also forced the Spanish royal family to resign their throne in favor of Napoleon's brother, Joseph.

'''''Daugherty v. Vanguard''''', 116 F.Supp.2d 897 (W.D. Mich. 2000) is one of a number of United States federal cases decided in the 2000s pertaining to the scope of allowable religious expression and/or activities in public schools. In the court’s summary judgment issued in September 2000, [[U.S. District Court]] Judge [[David McKeague]] ruled that Vanguard Charter Academy and its corporate parent, [[National Heritage Academies]], did not violate the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] through its Moral Focus Curriculum.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.educationlaw.org/images/PDFs/Feb01SLR.pdf  School Law Reporter] {{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case filed in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan]]-Southern Division derives its name from plaintiff Megan Daugherty and four other parents who alleged in 1998 that their children were subjected to “Christian influences” while the children attended Vanguard Charter School Academy in Wyoming, Michigan. Judge McKeague ruled that the allegations were unfounded and granted summary judgment to Vanguard and its parent corporation.&lt;ref&gt; [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3994/is_200107/ai_n8967937 ''Journal of Law and Education''] {{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the court’s 36-page opinion, Judge McKeague found that the school maintained a “correct posture of neutrality” regarding religious activities during school. The court granted the school and National Heritage Academies summary judgment, finding that the defendants “presented no more than a scintilla of evidence to support a finding that any constitutionally impermissible conduct occurred.” The ruling was not appealed by the defendants. 

The court’s opinion in ''Daugherty v. Vanguard'' is consistent with the U.S. Department of Education’s “Guidelines on Constitutionally Protected Prayer in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, [http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/religionandschools/prayer_guidance.html ''Guidance on Constitutionally Protected Prayer in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216013335/http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/religionandschools/prayer_guidance.html |date=December 16, 2016 }}, February 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''De divortio Lotharii regis et Theutbergae reginae''''' ("On the divorce of King Lothar and Queen Theutberga") is an extended mid ninth-century [[treatise]] written by [[Hincmar|Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims]] (d. 882), which survives in a single manuscript, Paris BnF. lat. 2866. It explores the issues arising from the attempt by [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothar II, king of Lotharingia]] (855–869), to rid himself of his wife Teutberga and replace her with his concubine, Waldrada. Hincmar is primarily concerned with defining what marriage is and how (or if) it may be ended, and with the duties of bishops and of kings. However, in the course of discussing these questions, he touches on many other issues too, and gives much detail on ninth-century politics and religious practice in [[Francia]].

For example: a [[witness]] who [[testimony|testifies]] that he saw the [[defendant]] shoot the [[crime victim|victim]] gives direct evidence. A witness who testifies that he saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime, or a [[forensics]] expert who says that ballistics proves that the defendant’s gun shot the bullet that killed the victim both give circumstantial evidence from which the defendant’s guilt may be inferred.

In direct evidence, a witness relates what he or she directly experienced. (Usually the experience is by sight or hearing, though it may come through any sense, including [[olfaction|smell,]] touch or pain. ''State v Famber'', 358 Mo 288, 214 SW2d 40.)

An '''emergency exit''' in a structure is a special exit for emergencies such as a fire: the combined use of regular and special exits allows for faster evacuation, while it also provides an alternative if the route to the regular exit is blocked by fire, etc.

The qualifications for an emergency exit are as follows: it must be in a location that is easily accessible, the exit must have an area or location that it can bring people to in the event of any emergency situation, it must be controlled by the inside of the building, it must be well managed and regularly up kept, and it must be in a permanent location.

It is usually in a strategically located (e.g. in a stairwell, hallway, or other likely places) outward opening door with a [[crash bar]] on it and with [[exit sign]]s leading to it. The name is a reference to when they were frequently used, however, a fire exit can also be a main doorway must be able to be unlocked from the inside of the room. A [[fire escape]] is a special kind of emergency exit, mounted to the outside of a building.

==History==
[[File:City Lit fire exit London.JPG|thumbnail|Fire exit in London. This was not originally a fire exit, as there is an engraving of the name of the building, but is now only used as a fire exit.]]
Following  the events of the [[Victoria Hall disaster]] in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland, England]] in 1883 in which more than 180 children died because a door had been bolted at the bottom of a stairwell, the [[British government]] began legal moves to enforce minimum standards for building safety. This slowly led to the legal requirement that venues must have a minimum numbers of outward opening emergency exits as well as locks which could be opened from the inside.

However, these moves were not globally copied for some time. For example, in the [[United States]], 146 factory workers died in the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 when they were stopped by locked exits, and 492 people died in the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] in a Boston nightclub in 1942. This led to regulations requiring that exits of large buildings open outward, and that enough emergency exits be provided to accommodate the building's capacity.

Similar disasters around the world also resulted in public fury and calls for changes to emergency regulations and enforcement. An investigation was launched by the Argentine federal government after 194 people were killed during the 2004 [[República Cromañón nightclub fire]] in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]. The emergency exits had been chained shut by the owners, to prevent people from sneaking into the nightclub without paying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reel|first=Monte|title=Fire, panic, and a locked main exit|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38140-2004Dec31.html|accessdate=July 11, 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=January 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
[[File:Fire Escape.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[fire escape]] is a type of emergency exit that is external to a building.]]

Local [[building code]]s will often dictate the number of fire exits required for a building of a given size. This may include specifying the number of [[stairs]]. For any building bigger than a private house, modern codes invariably specify at least two sets of stairs. Furthermore, such stairs must be completely separate from each other. Some architects meet this requirement by housing two stairs in a "[[double helix]]" configuration where two stairs occupy the same floor space, intertwined. For old buildings that predate modern fire code requirements and lack space for a second staircase, having intertwining stairs so close to each other may allow firefighters going up and evacuees going down to use separate staircases. &lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-statue-of-liberty-to-get-new-staircase-for-safety-2010aug09-story.html|title=Statue of Liberty to get new staircase for safety|first=COLLEEN LONG, Associated Press|last=Writer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Westfield Stratford City]] uses this configuration in the Upper car park. This part of the building has 8 storeys: LG, G &amp; 1 are part of the shopping centre; 2 has some offices &amp; a storage area; CP1, CP2, CP3 &amp; CP4 are a [[multi-storey car park]]. The floors are served by the main public lifts &amp; escalators, &amp; by 1 set of a double-helix stairway &amp; lift per 1000 square metres, going into the service areas. The main public escalators don't count as fire exits, as the doors may be locked during less busy periods. The building, therefore, has one fire exit per 4000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor space.

Knowing where the emergency exits are in buildings can save lives. Some buildings, such as schools, have [[fire drill]]s to practice using emergency exits. Many [[List of historic fires|disasters]] could have been prevented if people had known where fire escapes were and if emergency exits had not been blocked. For example, in the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], some of the emergency exits inside the building were inaccessible, while others were locked. In the [[Stardust Disaster]] and the [[2006 Moscow hospital fire]], the emergency exits were locked and most windows barred shut. In the case of the [[The Station nightclub fire|Station Nightclub]], the premises was over capacity the night fire broke out, the front exit was not designed well (right outside the door, the concrete approach split 90 degrees and a railing ran along the edge), and an emergency exit swung inward, not outward as code requires.

In many countries, it is required that all new commercial buildings include well-marked emergency exits. Older buildings must be retrofitted with [[fire escape]]s. In countries where emergency exits are not standard, fires will often result in a much greater loss of life.

===Signage===
[[File:Evac chair.jpg|thumb|upright|Sign for an emergency down stairs evacuation device for disabled people]]
{{Main|Exit sign}}

The UK Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996 define a fire safety sign as an illuminated sign or acoustic signal that provides information on escape routes and emergency exits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityfire.co.uk/news/fire-safety-signs-law-meaning/|title=Fire Safety Signs: The Law and Their Meaning - City Fire Protection - Blog|first=City Fire|last=Protection|date=22 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-designed emergency exit signs are necessary for emergency exits to be effective.

Fire escape signs usually display the word "EXIT" or the equivalent word in the local language with large, well-lit, green letters, or the green pictorial "running-man" symbol&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:grs:7010:2:E002 ISO 7010:2011 — Graphical symbols]&lt;/ref&gt; developed and adopted in [[Japan]] around 1980&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/signs/2010/03/the_big_red_word_vs_the_little_green_man.html?yahoo=y "The Big Red Word vs. the Little Green Man"], Julia Turner, March 2010, Slate.com&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced in 2003 by [[ISO 7010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connectingindustry.com/factoryequipment/the-iso-7010-safety-standard-and-what-it-means-for-you.aspx|title=The ISO 7010 safety standard and what it means for you - Factory Equipment|website=www.connectingindustry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pictorial green "running-man" sign is mandatory in the Japan, [[European Union]], [[South Korea]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianpropertymanagement.ca/TraditionalExitSignChangestoRunningMan.aspx Traditional Signs to EXIT in Favour of the Running Man ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228000000/http://www.canadianpropertymanagement.ca/TraditionalExitSignChangestoRunningMan.aspx |date=February 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and increasingly becoming common elsewhere.

Some states in the [[United States]] currently require the exit signs to be colored red, despite the usage of color red in signage usually implies hazards, prohibited actions or stop, while the color green implies safe place/actions or to proceed. Older building code in Canada required red exit signs, but no new installation is allowed.

==Blocked exits==
[[File:Door Alarmed.jpg|thumb|upright|Sign with unauthorized alarm warning]]
{{further|:Category:Fire disasters involving barricaded escape routes}}
Fire fighters have cited{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} overzealous guards who told people during a fire that they are not allowed to use emergency exits. The practice is actually quite common in the absence of fires, as well. Some skyscrapers have stairwells with standard emergency exit signs on each door, which then lock upon closing. Users of these stairwells are trapped, whether they know or do not know that the only door that opens from the inside is the one on the ground floor.

A further problem becoming very common in the USA (2005) is that retail stores at night close one of their main entrance/exits through makeshift heavy metal barriers, signage, paper notes, or junk placed in front of the exits. Some actually lock their exits. A large array of signage and mechanical exit systems have also been devised, including signage that says contradictorily, "This is not an exit," "Do not use this exit," or warning users that a heavy penalty will be assessed for non-emergency use.

Some systems do not allow the exit to be opened until the user signals the intention to exit (through a button or lever) for some amount of time, such as 20 seconds. It is also common for these exits to remain completely locked until somebody tests them.

Some have alarms activated when they are opened, to alert staff of unauthorized use during non-emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.firesafe.org.uk/security-and-fire-safety |title= security and fire safety |work= firesafe.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On many exits, the user may have to hold down a [[crash bar]] or other door opening device for a period of time to unlock the door. Many exits have a sign reading, 'emergency exit only, alarm will sound if opened', to warn of the fact that it is an emergency exit only.

==Aircraft==
[[File:737 emergency-exit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Boeing 737]] overwing emergency exit]]

In aircraft terms, an "exit" is any one of the main doors (entry doors on the port side of the aircraft and service doors on the starboard side) and an "emergency exit" is defined as a door that is only ever used in an emergency (such as [[overwing exits]] and permanently armed exits). Passengers seated in [[exit row]]s may be called upon to assist and open exits in the event of an emergency.

The number and type of exits on an aircraft is regulated through strict rules within the industry, and is based on whether the aircraft is single or twin-aisled; the maximum passenger load; and the maximum distance from a seat to an exit. The goal of these regulations is to make possible the evacuation of an airliner's designed maximum occupancy of passengers and crew within 90 seconds even if half of the available exits are blocked.

Any aircraft where the emergency exit door sill height is above that which would make unaided escape possible is fitted with an automatic inflatable [[evacuation slide]], which allows occupants to slide to the ground safely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7620">An '''equitable adjustment''', in [[government contracting]], is a [[contract adjustment]] pursuant to a [[changes clause]], to compensate the contractor expense incurred due to actions of the Government or to compensate the Government for contract reductions. An equitable adjustment includes an allowance for profit; clauses that provide for adjustments, excluding profit, are not considered "equitable adjustments."

==Variations==

*A "price adjustment" is a change to the established price of the contract arrived at by mutual agreement between the Government and contractor.
*An "adjustment in estimated quantities" is a contract adjustment pursuant to the contract clause on variation in estimated quantities.
*A "bilateral modification" is a supplemental agreement on which the Contracting Officer and the contractor have agreed to a price and/or time adjustment.  Contrast a "unilateral modification," a modification on which the Contracting Officer and the contractor cannot agree to a price and/or time adjustment equal to or within the Government Estimate. In such cases the modification containing the adjustment in price and/or time price contained in the Government Estimate may be issued unilaterally, with or without a Contracting Officer's Final Decision. Unilateral modifications are also used to make administrative changes and to issue termination notices.

==In a "changes clause" in government construction contracts==
[[Changes clause]]s give the government the power unilaterally to order contractual modifications;&lt;ref&gt;4-15 Construction Law P 15.03&lt;/ref&gt; in return, the contract specifies that if the parties are unable to agree on compensation to be received by the contractor for the modified work, the contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment. The goal of an equitable adjustment is to place the contractor in the position he or she would have been in had the change not been encountered. The adjustment should not alter the contractor's profit or loss position from what it was before the change occurred.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Shea Co. v. United States, 10 Cl. Ct. 620 (1986) . Where a contract was bid in a lump sum, the equitable adjustment for substitution of work is computed by the following formula: (1) Adjusted contract price; (2) Less projected cost without changed conditions; (3) Plus actual cost under changed conditions; (4) Plus reasonable profit/overhead computed in accordance with governing regulations on difference between 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
As mutually agreed by the government and contractor.

==Venues==
Equitable adjustments are determined by federal agencies.&lt;ref&gt;4-15 Construction Law P 15.03&lt;/ref&gt;  The cornerstone of the regulatory scheme is the [[Federal Acquisition Regulations System]], which comprises the [[Federal Acquisition Regulation]] (hereinafter referred to as "FAR"), which are contained in Chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations,&lt;ref&gt;The FAR were published at  48 Fed. Reg. 42,102&lt;/ref&gt; and agency regulations supplementing or implementing the FAR.&lt;ref&gt;Agency regulations implementing the FAR are as follows:  Agency for International Development (AID), 49 Fed. Reg. 13,236 (1984) ;  Department of Commerce, 49 Fed. Reg. 12,956 (1984) ;  Department of Defense, 49 Fed. Reg. 11,302 (1984) ;  Department of Energy, 49 Fed. Reg. 11,922 (1984) ;  Environmental Protection Agency, 49 Fed. Reg. 8834 (1984) ;  Federal Emergency Management Agency, 49 Fed. Reg. 12,646 (1984) ;  General Services Administration, 49 Fed. Reg. 10,792 (1984) ; Department of Health and Human Services, 48 C.F.R. ch. 3;  Department of Housing and Urban Development, 49 Fed. Reg. 8258 (1984) ;  National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 49 Fed. Reg. 12,370 (1984) ; National Science Foundation, 48 C.F.R. ch. 25; Department of Transportation, 48 C.F.R. ch. 12; and Veterans Administration, 48 C.F.R. ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the FAR apply to contract solicitations issued on or after April 1, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;48 Fed. Reg. 42,102 .&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier contracts are governed by the prior agency regulations. The principal prior regulations were the Defense Acquisition Regulations &lt;ref&gt;48 C.F.R. ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Federal Procurement Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;48 C.F.R. ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several major legislative changes over the years. The [[Contract Disputes Act]] of 1978&lt;ref&gt;41 U.S.C. §§ 601-613. See also  In re Liberty Constr., 9 F.3d 800 (9th Cir. 1993) (the federal district courts have subject matter jurisdiction in suits against the SBA, even after the passage of the Contract Disputes Act, because the SBA's "sue and be sued" provision independently confers jurisdiction).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal Courts Improvement Act]] of 1982&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 97-164, 96 Stat. 25 (Apr. 2, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; established new procedures and remedies for the resolution of disputes between the government and contractors. The [[Competition in Contracting Act]] of 1984 (CICA) &lt;ref&gt;41 U.S.C. §§ 251 and 253.&lt;/ref&gt; encourages competitive government [[procurement]] procedures.&lt;ref&gt;See  AT&amp;T Communications, Inc. v. Wiltel, Inc., 1 F.3d 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (The [[Competition in Contracting Act|CICA]] does not prevent modifications to a contract if the modifications are not outside the scope of the original contract); Birch &amp; Davis Int'l, Inc. v. Christopher, 4 F.3d 970 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (CICA and FAR preclude the elimination of a bidder as not in competitive range if such bidder has a "reasonable chance" that it will be selected); Rapides Regional Medical Ctr. v. Secretary, 974 F.2d 565 (5th Cir. 1992) (defining "procurement" as the term applies to the CICA).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirement of causation==
To paraphrase Ralph L. Jones Co. v. United States, 33 Fed. Cl. 327, 331-332 (Fed. Cl. 1995):
:The ultimate goal of an equitable adjustment is to do equity;&lt;ref&gt;General Dynamics Corp. v. United States. 218 Ct. Cl. 40, 56, 585 F.2d 457 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve equity, the government contractor seeking an equitable adjustment bears the "essential burden of establishing the fundamental facts of liability, causation, and resultant injury."&lt;ref&gt;Wunderlich Contracting Co. v. United States, 351 F.2d 956, 968-969 (Ct. Cl. 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;  It must show that the increased costs arose from work which was materially different from that contemplated by the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Mojave Enterprises v. United States 3 Cl. Ct. 353, 357 (1983); Miller Elevator Co., Inc. v. United States 30 Fed. Cl. 662, 678 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The increased costs must be the direct and necessary result of the changes.&lt;ref&gt;Johns-Manville v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. 1, 33 (1987) (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;
:An equitable adjustment is determined by whether the work was foreseeable based on the information before the contractor at the time of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;See Johns-Manville v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. 1, 33 (1987); Sterling Millwrights v. United States, 26 Cl. Ct. 49, 72 (1992); Mojave Enterprises, 3 Cl. Ct. at 357.&lt;/ref&gt; "Foreseeability" in this instance refers to work that reasonably could be anticipated based on the contemplation of the parties. The question is whether the work would be a foreseeable consequence of those matters the parties "considered with continued attention," regarded thoughtfully, or "viewed . . . as probable or as an . . . intention."See Webster's New International Dictionary, 2d ed. 574 (1955).

'''Familial homicide''' is a form of [[homicide]] recognised in England and Wales by the [[Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004]] and carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years.

The Act closes a legal [[loophole]] that allows those jointly accused of the murder of a child or [[vulnerable adult]] to avoid prosecution by remaining silent or blaming each other; it puts a clear legal responsibility on adults who have frequent contact with a child or vulnerable adult to take reasonable steps of protection if they knew or should have known the child or vulnerable adult was at significant [[risk]] of serious physical harm from members of that household.

==Cases and convictions==
On Friday, 15 December 2006, Rebecca Lewis was sentenced to six years imprisonment for failing to prevent the murder of her 13-month-old son by her boyfriend in [[Wales]].

A number of people were charged with this offence in connection with the discovery of a headless and dismembered body (which later proved to be that of [[Murder of Michael Gilbert|Michael Gilbert]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/8530096.stm]) in the Blue Lagoon, [[Arlesey]], Bedfordshire, an English beauty spot. On 23 April 2010 James Watt, his girlfriend Natasha Oldfield, and his brother's girlfriend Nichola Roberts were convicted of murder whilst James's brothers Richard Watt and Robert Watt and his mother Jennifer Smith-Dennis were convicted of the familial homicide of Michael Gilbert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5540">This is an appendix to the article [[Territorial formation of France]]. It is concerned with the detail of the minor treaties dealing with the borders between France and its neighbours, since the [[Treaty of Vienna (1815)]]. It is a translation of the appendix in the French Wikipedia article, [[:fr:Formation territoriale de la France métropolitaine]].

== Appendix: minor modifications to the frontiers since 1815 ==

=== Modifications of France's frontiers with [[Andorra]] (2001) ===
In 2001, a treaty was concluded between France and [[Andorra]] mentioning amendment of the border. In it, two parcels of territory were exchanged, each 1.5 ha in area. The operation should permit Andorra to erect, on the land ceded to it, the viaduct which should link the [[Bordes d'Envalira|Envalira]] tunnel to the French [[Route nationale 22]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/projets/pl3115.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modifications of France's frontiers with [[Luxembourg]] (2006) ===
In July 2006, a treaty between Luxembourg and France exchanged parcels of 8.096079 hectares, to allow the formation of infrastructure financed by the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, on French territory, (in the commune of [[Russange]], [[Moselle (département)|Moselle]]). The work was connected with the industrial site of West [[Belval, Luxembourg|Belval]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/projets/pl3551.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modifications of France's frontiers with [[Switzerland]] (1945 to 2002) ===
Since 1945 very many minor modifications of the frontier have been concluded with Switzerland.:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/rapports/r1339.asp#P108_2840&lt;/ref&gt;
* 19 December 1947 : accord concerning the [[Canal pound|pound]]s&lt;ref&gt;The French word, ‘bief ‘ may be referring to [[leat]]s feeding mills or small power stations, or it may mean the [[Canal pound|pounds or levels]] of the canal itself; probably, the latter.&lt;/ref&gt; at Kembs and at Ottmarsheim, of the lateral canal of the [[Rhine]] (modification of the frontier to take account of the diversion of the [[Rhine]] from the canal bed).
* 4 July 1949 : convention relating to the construction and use of the [[EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg|Basel-Mulhouse airport]] at [[Blotzheim]] (construction of the airport of [[Basel]] was done partially on land of the commune of Blotzheim; Switzerland reciprocated by secession of territory and Mulhouse (France) has benefited equally from the improved international airport. Furnishing and extending the airport have entailed the signing of a series of accords, some of which involved the exchange of land.
* 25 February 1953 : convention on the determination of the frontier in [[Lake Geneva]] (codification of the customary line of the frontier on the lake).
* 25 February 1953 : convention on various modifications of the frontier (exchange of land with Switzerland in [[Haut-Rhin]], the [[Territory of Belfort]] and [[Doubs (département)|Doubs]] in order to conform with changes in the local topography).
* 25 February 1953 : convention on various modifications of the frontier along the French route nationale N206.
* 3 December 1956 : convention concerning the fixing the frontier between the canton of [[Basel-City]] (Switzerland) and the département of Haut-Rhin (France).
* 3 December 1959 : convention concerning rectifying the border between the [[canton of Neuchâtel]] and the département of [[Doubs]].
* 3 December 1959 : convention on the correction of the stream, The Boiron.
* 3 December 1959 : convention relative to a modification of the border between the [[canton of Vaud]] and the [[Ain|département of Ain]] (between marker stones 287 and 299).
* 3 December 1959 : convention concerning a rectification of the border of the [[Hermance (river)|Hermance]].
* 23 August 1963 : convention concerning a rectifying the border between the [[Valais|Canton of Valais]] and the département of [[Haute-Savoie]];
* 10 July 1973 : convention concerning a rectification of the frontier between the département of Haute-Savoie and the [[Canton of Geneva]];
* 4–7 July 1977 : exchange of notes relating to the coming into force of the convention of 25 February 1953 between France and Switzerland on various modifications of the border ([[Route nationale (France)|RN 206]]) - The date of coming into force was fixed for 26 November 1979.
* 18 September 1996 : convention including rectifying the border between the département of Doubs and the [[Canton of Vaud]];
* 18 September 1996 : convention aimed at rectifying the border, following the joining of the motorways between [[Saint-Julien-en-Genevois]], Haute-Savoie, and [[Bardonnex]], canton of Geneva (permitted Switzerland to arrange holdings necessary for the construction of a road interchange).
* 18 January 2002 : convention aimed at four border rectifications between the canton of Geneva and the départements of Haute-Savoie (communes of [[Viry, Haute-Savoie|Viry]], [[Valleiry]] et [[Veigy-Foncenex]]) and of Ain (commune de [[Saint-Genis-Pouilly]]), dealing with a total area of 578 m², aimed at making the line of the frontier more orderly and rational, and so taking into account developments of the land with the passage of time, both in France and in Switzerland, of which most had already been backed by the adjoining owners.

== Global Warming Taxes ==
In response to widespread concerns about a general increase in the temperature of the earth's climate, a number of tax jurisdictions have proposed or imposed '''global warming taxes''' intended to generate revenues to mitigate the effects of the human activities contributing to [[global warming]] or to discourage such activities.

== History ==
The idea of using taxes to fix problems, rather than merely raise government revenue, has a long history. The British economist [[Arthur Cecil Pigou|Arthur Pigou]] advocated such corrective taxes to deal with pollution in the early 20th century. In his honor, economics textbooks now call them “Pigovian taxes.”

Using a Pigovian tax to address global warming is also an old idea. It was proposed as far back as 1992 by Martin S. Feldstein, once chief economist to Ronald Reagan, on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/business/16view.html] www.nytimes.com, "One Answer to Global Warming: A New Tax"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jurisdictions Imposing Global Warming Taxes ==

=== California ===
* San Francisco Bay Area Air Quality Management District has proposed a carbon dioxide emission fee that would charge businesses 4.2 cents for every metric ton of carbon dioxide released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/19/MNEV1083DT.DTL] www.sfgate.com, "Bay Area businesses may pay fee for emissions"&lt;/ref&gt;  The estimated $1.2 million in fees raised annually on businesses in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area region would start July 1, 2008, and are not intended to deter greenhouse gas production in most cases,  but would pay for the cost of monitoring greenhouse gases.
* California Assembly Bill 2358 will take the existing $34 vehicle registration fee and add up to an extra $25 based on the unladen weight of the vehicle. A second tax of up to $25 would be added based on the level of carbon dioxide emissions. Together, the new fees would more than double the total possible registration fee to $84.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/23/2315.asp] theNewspaper.com "California Legislators to Consider Global Warming Tax
"&lt;/ref&gt;

* California Assembly Bill 2558 would hand the [[Metro (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], which operates bus and light rail service, the authority to impose either a three-percent sales tax on gas (11 cents per gallon at current prices) or a $90 hike in vehicle registration taxes. Funds raised from motorists would then be placed in a Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Fund that would be used on "public transit projects and programs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/23/2315.asp] theNewspaper.com "California Legislators to Consider Global Warming Tax

The '''Hague choice of court convention''', formally the '''Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements''' is an international treaty concluded within the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]. It was concluded in 2005, and entered into force on 1 October 2015. The European Union (covering the European territory of all [[member states of the European Union|member states]] except Denmark), Denmark, Mexico and Singapore are parties to the convention.&lt;ref name=parties&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&amp;cid=98|title=Status Table: 37: Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements|accessdate=19 April 2013|work=[[Hague Conference on Private International Law|HCCH]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; China, Montenegro, Ukraine and the United States signed the convention, but did not ratify.

Parties under the convention recognize a [[choice of court]] agreement between parties in the field of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and thus courts not chosen in the agreement will stay all proceedings (unless the chosen court refuses to uphold the jurisdiction). For the convention choice of court agreements must be "exclusive": which means in the context of the convention that also a group of courts may be chosen, as long as they are in the same country. It is not required for a choice of court agreement to explicitly state that the agreement is exclusive, designating a specific (set of) courts will automatically render it exclusive.

Judgments by the chosen court must be recognized in all states where the convention is applicable.

==History==
The Hague Conference started with the "Judgements project" in 1996: the development of a convention regarding jurisdiction and recognition of judgements. Jurisdiction within such a convention would be classified in three categories: bases of jurisdiction which were obligatory, optional or prohibited. As the negotiators were not able to come to a consensus on such a convention, the scope of the work was reduced to jurisdiction and recognition of decisions based on a choice of court agreement between the parties. During the negotiations parallels were drawn between the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention]] on arbitral awards: the aim was to create a system of recognition of decisions based on court cases where the court was chosen pursuant to a choice of court agreements, which would create the same level of predictability and enforceability as is the case in arbitral awards in New York Convention states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The 2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements|authors=Ronald A. Brand and Paul M. Herrup|publisher=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dP9HEwtsaUwC&amp;pg=PA222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heinrich Boere''' (27 September 1921 – 1 December 2013) was a convicted [[Germans|German]]-[[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[war crime|war criminal]] and former member of the [[Waffen-SS]]. He was on the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]'s [[List of Most Wanted Nazi War Criminals according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center|list of most wanted Nazi war criminals]].

== Early life ==

Boere was born in [[Eschweiler]], Germany, to a Dutch father and a German mother, but his parents moved to [[Maastricht]] when he was two years old. He volunteered for the [[Waffen-SS]] in September 1940, only months after the [[German occupation of the Netherlands#German invasion|German occupation of the Netherlands]]. In June 1941 at the age of 19 he left to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] including, in 1942, service in the Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7072489.ece |title=Times On Line article |publisher=Times On Line article |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, he contracted [[pyelonephritis]] and was sent back to [[Maastricht]].&lt;ref&gt;Menno van Dongen, [http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article400930.ece A war criminal without remorse], [[De Volkskrant]] 26 februari 2007 &amp; {{cite web |url=http://www.tekstidee.nl/ArtikeloorlogsmisdadigerBoere.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307141701/http://www.tekstidee.nl/ArtikeloorlogsmisdadigerBoere.htm |archivedate=2008-03-07 |df= }} (both Dutch), retrieved Aug 24 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== War crimes ==

In 1943, Boere became a member of a 15-man [[Waffen-SS]] squad of Dutch volunteers, the ''Sonderkommando'' ''[[Henk Feldmeijer|Feldmeijer]]'', who were given the task of killing members of the [[Dutch resistance]] and anti-German citizens in retaliation for acts of resistance against the Nazi occupation of their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7072489.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=SS killer Heinrich Boere finally jailed at 88 | date=24 March 2010 | first1=Roger | last1=Boyes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following attacks on German occupation forces and Dutch [[Collaboration during World War II#Netherlands|collaborators]], the [[SS and Police Leader]] for the Netherlands, [[Hanns Albin Rauter]], ordered the ''Sonderkommando'' to retaliate by assassinating civilians presumed to be in some way connected to the resistance.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite news | last = Crossland| first = David | coauthors = | title = 86-Year-Old SS Killer Faces Murder Charges | publisher = [[Der Spiegel]] | date = 2008-04-14 | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,547216,00.html| language = | accessdate = 2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This operation, codenamed ''[[Operation Silbertanne|Silbertanne]]'' ([[Abies alba|Silver Fir]]), was responsible for probably 54 known killings, three of which Boere admitted to committing.&lt;ref name=rising&gt;{{cite news  | last = Rising  | first = David| coauthors =  | title =Nazis' gunman dodges jail, ages in peace  | work =  | pages =  | language =  | agency = Associated Press  | date = 8 March 2008  | url = http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2008/03/07/nazis_gunman_dodges_jail_ages_in_peace/ | accessdate = 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boere’s first killing was committed in July 1944 when he and fellow SS member [[Jacobus Petrus Besteman]] received orders from the local [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (Security Service) office in [[Breda]] to murder a [[Pharmacy|pharmacist]] named [[Fritz Hubert Ernst Bicknese]], father of twelve. Wearing civilian clothes, Boere and Besteman walked into Bicknese’s pharmacy and asked him his identity. Upon a positive reply, Boere fired three shots into Bicknese’s upper body, then Besteman fired several more shots as Bicknese lay on the floor.&lt;ref name=rising/&gt;

In September 1944, on a Sunday, Boere and [[Hendrik Kromhout]] arrived in [[Voorschoten]] at the home of [[Teun de Groot]], a bicycle-shop owner and father of five children, who hid fugitives in his shop and was an acquaintance of anti-Nazi activists. As De Groot, still in his pyjamas, fumbled with his wallet to show his ID papers, Boere and Kromhout shot him. They then went to the apartment of [[Frans Willem Kusters]], forced him into their car, and drove out of town. The pair then falsely claimed that they had a flat tire, stopped the vehicle and shot Kusters.&lt;ref name=rising/&gt;

== Post-war years ==

In the immediate post-war years, Boere spent two years in an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[prisoner-of-war camp]], where he was interrogated and admitted to the three killings. After release from the PoW camp, Boere initially went into hiding out of fear of being sentenced to a lengthy prison sentence, but managed to flee to [[Germany]]. In 1949, a Dutch court sentenced Boere to [[capital punishment|death]] ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for the three murders, for supporting the enemy, and for serving in the army of the enemy. According to Dutch law, the last automatically leads to the loss of Dutch citizenship. Boere claimed German citizenship on the basis of a so-called ''Führererlass'', a law promulgated by Hitler providing all SS-members with German citizenship. This law remained in force during the 1950s and 1960s in Germany, but was later annulled under pressure from the [[European Union]]. From that point on, Boere was stateless, which was confirmed during the trial against him that started in October 2009. The German government refused to [[extradition|extradite]] him. [[West Germany]] was responsible for prosecuting war criminals, but Boere was never brought to trial there.&lt;ref name=rising/&gt;

The Dutch government repeatedly sought Boere’s extradition. In 1983, a German court refused the Dutch request to hand Boere over to the Dutch authorities on the grounds that Boere might have German citizenship, and Germany, at that time, did not permit extraditing its own nationals. In 2007, a court in [[Aachen]] ruled that Boere could serve his sentence in Germany, but an appeals court in [[Cologne]] overturned the ruling, saying that the 1949 conviction was invalid because Boere was unable to present a defense. Boere’s case attracted a great deal of public attention and, in 2007, the opposition in the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|Dutch parliament]] brought the case up with the [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Justice]]. Boere was listed by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] as a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] war criminal-at-large. Besteman, Boere’s partner in the Bicknese slaying, served time in prison in the Netherlands for his war crimes.&lt;ref name=rising/&gt;

On 14 April 2008 the state prosecution in [[Dortmund]] announced it was preparing to file charges against Boere.&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; On 8 January 2009, the State Court of [[Aachen]] ruled that Boere was medically unfit and did not have to stand trial in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Oud-SSer Boere niet meer voor de rechter| publisher = [[NRC Handelsblad]] | date = 2009-01-07 | url = http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/article2114523.ece/Oud-SSer_Boere_niet_meer_voor_de_rechter | language = Dutch | accessdate = 2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oberlandesgericht|Provincial Court of Appeal]] in [[Cologne]] ruled on 7 July 2009, that Boere was fit for trial, overturning the lower court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Nazi hitman Heinrich Boere, 88, IS fit to stand trial for 1944 triple execution, court rules| publisher = [[Mail Online]] | date = 2009-07-07 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1198100/Nazi-hitman-Heinrich-Boere-88-IS-fit-stand-trial-1944-triple-execution-court-rules.html | language = | accessdate = 2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a [[judicial review]] by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|German Constitutional Court]], the court decided not to accept Boere's appeal and ruled further that Boere was indeed fit to stand trial. However, according to the court he would be under medical supervision, being provided with a doctor for the length of the trial. The trial started on 28 October 2009, at Aachen's regional court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Boere/Demjanjuk: Die letzten großen NS-Prozesse | newspaper = [[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]] | location = | pages = | language = German | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.focus.de/panorama/vermischtes/boere-demjanjuk-die-letzten-grossen-ns-prozesse_aid_443145.html | accessdate = 2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Boere lived in an old-age home in his birth town of Eschweiler, Germany.&lt;ref name=rising/&gt; He was not taken into custody for the trial against him. In an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', he said, "I'm not interested in what happened back then."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;"[http://worldnews.about.com/od/crime/tp/nazimostwanted.htm Most Wanted Nazis]," Bridget Johnson, [[About.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; In a documentary by Dutch journalists [[Rob van Olm]] and [[Jan Louter]], who were the first to bring Boere to the attention of the public, Boere did admit to some feeling of [[remorse]] and stated he has confessed his crimes to a priest, and prayed for his victims. On 23 March 2010 in Aachen, Germany, he was sentenced to life in prison. His defence, that he would have been shot had he disobeyed orders (sometimes known as the '[[Nuremberg Defense]]'), was rejected. Following the ruling of the court, his solicitors announced that they would appeal the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Former Nazi SS member convicted of Dutch murders   | work = | publisher = BBC | date = 23 March 2010 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8582449.stm | doi = | accessdate = 23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his appeal was rejected, Boere began serving his life sentence on 16 December 2011 at the age of 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = SS killer Heinrich Boere begins jail term at 90 | work = BBC News | date= 15 December 2011 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16204994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boere died on 1 December 2013 while in prison custody at [[Fröndenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/kriegsverbrecher-tot-ss-mann-heinrich-boere-in-haft-gestorben-a-936767.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8129">{{UStaxation}}
In the [[United States of America]], an '''income tax audit''' is the examination of a business or individual tax return by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) or state tax authority. The IRS and various state revenue departments use the terms audit, examination, review, and notice to describe various aspects of enforcement and administration of the tax laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8ypVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jj0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6131%2C3242089 Income Tax Audit Hits One Of Every 47 Filers], ''The Robesonian'', January 24, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose of a tax audit or a return examination is to determine whether reports filed with the taxing authorities are correct.&lt;ref name="IRS Audits"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=219552,00.html |title=IRS Audits |publisher=[[IRS]] |year=2012 |access-date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax agencies identify and resolve [[taxpayer]] errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/10databk.pdf |title=IRS Data Book 2010 |publisher=[[IRS]] |year=2010 |access-date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection methods==
There are several different methods used to select individuals and businesses for examination.

=== Third party documentation ===
Employers and financial institutions, among other organizations, are required by law to send documentation (W-2's and 1099's, for example) to the IRS. The IRS uses software to ensure that the numbers on a tax return match the numbers the IRS receives from third parties. If the documentation does not match, the return may be examined.&lt;ref name="Common Reasons for Tax Audits"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.taxaudit.com/common-reasons-for-tax-audits |title=Common Reasons for Tax Audits |publisher=[[Tax Resources, Inc]] |year=2012 |access-date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DIF score===
When a tax return is filed, the IRS uses computer software called the Discriminant Index Function System (DIF) to analyze the return for oddities and discrepancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/personal-income-taxes/income-tax-audits2.htm|title=How Income Tax Audits Work |publisher=[[How Stuff Works]] |year=2007 |access-date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the return has been processed through DIF, it is given a score. If the DIF score is high enough (i.e. a large amount of oddities or discrepancies are found), that tax return may be selected for examination. The formulas the IRS use to create the DIF software and analysis are a closely guarded secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moneyunder30.com/avoid-irs-audit|title=How to Avoid an IRS Audit |publisher=[[Money Under 30]] |year=2009 |access-date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UIDIF score===
Filed tax returns are also subjected to an evaluation called the UIDIF, or the Unreported Income Discriminant Index Function System. This evaluation involves the analysis of tax returns based on a series of factors to determine a tax return's potential for unreported income. Returns that are found to have a high UIDIF score (i.e. the likelihood of unreported income) and a high DIF score may be selected for examination. The IRS formulas used to calculated UDIF are secret, but it is commonly thought that the IRS uses statistical comparisons between returns to determine UIDIF potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sambrotman.com/irs-audit-red-flags-part-one/|title=Why IRS Audits Occur|publisher=[[The Resource Blog]] |year=2013 |access-date=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random selection===
The IRS selects a certain number of income tax returns to be audited each year through random selection.&lt;ref name="Common Reasons for Tax Audits"/&gt; No errors need to be found for the Enforcement branch to examine a tax return. Random selection exams tend to be more extensive and time-consuming than other forms of review.

====Controversy====
The practice of random selection has been a source of controversy for many years. The practice was suspended for a short time in the early 2000s amid criticism that the audits were too burdensome and intrusive. The IRS revived the practice in the fall of 2006.&lt;ref name='The Wall Street Journal June 13, 2007'&gt;{{Cite news|first=Tom |last=Herman |title=The Next Audit Scare |date=June 13, 2007 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118169532238233324 |work=The Wall Street Journal    |accessdate=February 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxpayer rights &amp; tax audit representation==
When a return is selected for examination, the taxpayer has certain rights during the process.

===Taxpayer rights===
Each state will have its own version with respect to state taxes. With respect to U.S. federal income taxation, the taxpayer has the following rights:&lt;ref name="IRS Audits"/&gt;
* A right to professional and courteous treatment by IRS employees.
* A [[right to privacy]] and confidentiality about tax matters.
* A right to know why the IRS is asking for information, how the IRS will use it and what will happen if the requested information is not provided.
* A right to representation, by oneself or by an authorized representative.
* A right to appeal disagreements, both within the IRS and before the courts.
* A right to be provided with all information concerning with any changes on tax administration 
A taxpayer is required only to submit the auditor information relating to the specific year listed in the audit notice.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last = Brabec|first= Barbara|authorlink=|title=How to Maximize Schedule C Deductions &amp; Cut Self-Employment Taxes to the BONE -|publisher=Barbara Brabec Productions |date=Nov 26, 2014 |location=| pages=107|isbn= 978-0985633318|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax audit representation===
[[Audit representation]], also called audit defense, occurs when a tax or legal professional stands in on behalf of a taxpayer during an examination. Federal law and all states allow a taxpayer to have an authorized representative. The representative must have permission to practice before the IRS or state, and specific credentials are required. The types of representatives who are allowed to represent taxpayers before the IRS in income tax audits include [[Attorneys in the United States|attorneys]], [[Certified Public Accountant|certified public accountants]] (CPAs), and [[enrolled agent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1.pdf|title=Your Rights as a Taxpayer |publisher=[[IRS]] |year=2005 |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joint Audit==
A '''joint tax audit''' is the examination of a business or individual tax return by a common audit team with members of two or more States examining cross-border tax situations as one tax audit to gain a uniform actual and legal assessment concerning this situation.&lt;ref&gt;Till Meickmann, [https://books.google.de/books?id=_U1mBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA572&amp;lpg=PA572&amp;dq=books+taxing+german+dutch+cross+border&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wmjkSrwY6h&amp;sig=n27YTC8wGKRldto9qV7ze6oWnGw&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0hA2VebUBIW6sQHGk4HoDQ&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Taxing German-Dutch Cross-Border Business Activities], p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1323">In the [[law of evidence]], the phrase '''information and belief'''  identifies a statement that is made, not from firsthand knowledge, but "based on secondhand information that the declarant believes is true".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan A. Garner]] ed., ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' 783 (7th ed. 1999), cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=-pp2GmvAZgAC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22information+and+belief%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NJFQTMWmM4i8sQOKr5m-Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22information%20and%20belief%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is often used in [[legal pleadings]], [[declaration (law)|declaration]]s under penalty of [[perjury]], and [[affidavit]]s under oath.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary"/&gt;  It is often used in a phrase similar to: "The plaintiff is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief alleges".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fhYLAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Southeastern reporter'', Volume 108]''&lt;/ref&gt; This "protects the maker of the statement from claims of outright falsehood or [[perjury]]".&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary"&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Information+and+Belief The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coat of Arms of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.svg|250px|right|thumb|Coat of Arms of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland used 1654-5.]]
The '''Instrument of Government''' was a constitution of the [[Commonwealth of England#The Protectorate, 1653–1659|Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]]. Drafted by [[John Lambert (General)|Major-General John Lambert]] in 1653, it was the first sovereign codified and written constitution in England.

==Antecedence==
The ''Instrument of Government'' included elements incorporated from an earlier document "[[Heads of Proposals]]",&lt;ref&gt;Tyacke [https://books.google.com/books?id=McvcmiZ6h8gC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22Heads+of+Proposals%22+++%22Instrument+of+Government%22&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heads%20of%20Proposals%22%20%20%20%22Instrument%20of%20Government%22&amp;f=false p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farr [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MmxFHPk0MSUC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22Heads+of+Proposals%22+++%22Instrument+of+Government%22&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heads%20of%20Proposals%22%20%20%20%22Instrument%20of%20Government%22&amp;f=false pp. 80,81]. See ''Declaration of Representation'' of 14 June 1647&lt;/ref&gt; which had been agreed to by the [[Army Council (1647)|Army Council]] in 1647, as set of propositions intended to be a basis for a constitutional settlement after [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] was defeated in the [[First English Civil War]]. Charles had rejected the propositions, but before the start of the Second Civil War the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|"Grandees"]] (senior officers opposing the Leveller faction) of the [[New Model Army]] had presented the ''Heads of Proposals'' as their alternative to the more radical [[Agreement of the People]] presented by the Agitators and their civilian supporters at the [[Putney Debates]].

On 4 January 1649, the [[Rump Parliament]] declared "that the people are, under God, the original of all just power; that the Commons of England, being chosen by and representing the people, have the supreme power in this nation".&lt;ref name=Fritze&gt;Fritze, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8goko0Lpr5sC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;f=false p. 228]&lt;/ref&gt; This was used as the basis for the House of Commons to pass acts of parliament which did not have to be passed by the House of Lords or receive royal assent. Two days later the Rump alone passed the act creating the high court of justice that would try Charles as a traitor.&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt; Charles was [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|tried and executed]] later that month.

On 17 March, the Rump passed an [[Act abolishing the kingship|act abolishing the monarchy]] and two days later an act abolishing the House of Lords. On 19 May 1649 the Rump passed [[s:Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth|An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt; It was a simple declaration that Parliament would appoint "Officers and Ministers under them for the good of the People... without any King or House of Lords".

==Articles==
The ''Instrument of Government'' split the government of England across three elements.

*An [[English Council of State]] of around twenty members to provide advice in the same manner as former [[Privy Council]]s
*[[Executive power]] was held by the [[Lord Protector]]. Although this post was elective, not hereditary, appointment was to be held for life. 
*Legislation was raised in Parliament. These had to be called triennially, with each sitting for at least five months.

The powers of the Lord Protector were limited in some areas. He could effectively temporarily veto a bill from Parliament but a second majority vote after twenty days would pass the bill.(XXIV)


The instrument declared "That the supreme legislative authority of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the dominions thereunto belonging, shall be and reside in one person, and the people assembled in Parliament: the style of which person shall be the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland"


Provision for a standing army "of 10,000 horse and dragoons, and 20,000 foot, in England, Scotland and Ireland, for the defence and security thereof" and "a convenient number of ships for guarding of the seas"(XXVII). 

The instrument defined the numbers of MPs to be elected to parliament but at the same time disbarred Royalists from election and temporarily from voting - (XIV) and Catholics from election or voting (XV).

Electors needed to have a property holding of £200.

==Adoption and replacement==
The ''Instrument of Government'' was adopted by the [[Council of Officers]] on 15 December 1653 and [[Oliver Cromwell]] was installed as [[Lord Protector]] on the following day. In January 1655, Cromwell dissolved the [[first Protectorate Parliament]], ushering in a period of [[Military dictatorship|military rule]] by the [[Rule of the Major-Generals|Major Generals]].

The ''Instrument of Government'' was replaced in May 1657 by England's second, and last, codified constitution, the [[Humble Petition and Advice]].

==Influence on the American constitution==
Since America had already been [[colonised]] by the [[Kingdom of England|English]]—in 1607, at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], and in 1620, at [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]]—the United States has sometimes claimed this historic document as a part of its political, legal, and historic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, [https://books.google.com/books?id=94W2jll2wgYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA113&amp;dq=American+constitution++%22Instrument+of+Government%22+1653&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 113]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International University College of Turin''', or '''IUC Turin''', is an independent University founded in 2006 with a grant from  the [[:it:Compagnia di San Paolo|Compagnia di San Paolo]] and [[:it:Consiglio Nazionale del Notariato|Consiglio Nazionale del Notariato]]. Teaching at IUC focuses on the interdisciplinary and critical study of [[law]], [[economics]] and [[finance]]. The IUC is located in the center of the city of [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. The Founding President of IUC is Franzo Grande Stevens. Stefano Rodotà served as President until 2014. The current  President is Edoardo Reviglio.

==Purpose and programme==

The reported aim of the IUC is to further the study of global [[capitalism]] and the preparation of an international class of lawyers and finance experts, with a critical policy orientation.&lt;ref name="EndOfEndOfHistory"&gt;[http://www.bepress.com/gj/vol9/iss3/ "IUC Independent Policy Report: At the End of the End of History - Global Legal Standards: Part of the Solution or Part of the Problem?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826023930/http://www.bepress.com/gj/vol9/iss3/ |date=2009-08-26 }}, ''Global Jurist'', vol. 9, iss. 3 (June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The IUC offers a two-year [[Master of Science]] in [[Comparative Law]], [[Economics]] and [[Finance]] ([[MSc]] CLEF) degree.&lt;ref name="MScIUC"&gt;[http://www.iuctorino.it/en/02924/page.html IUC Turin: MSc CLEF] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080316224040/http://www.iuctorino.it/en/02924/page.html |date=2008-03-16 }}, ''www.iuctorino.it'' (September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewsPiemonteItalian"&gt;[http://www.regione.piemonte.it/innovazione/universit-/notizie/a-torino-il-primo-master-of-science-in-comparative-law-economics-and-finance-msc-clef-2.html "A Torino il primo Master of Science in Comparative Law, Economics and Finance (MSc CLEF)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023054252/http://www.regione.piemonte.it/innovazione/universit-/notizie/a-torino-il-primo-master-of-science-in-comparative-law-economics-and-finance-msc-clef-2.html |date=2016-10-23 }}, ''Department of Science and Innovation of the Piedmont Region'', News Archive (April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in academic year 2010–11, the IUC also offers a one-year [[LL.M.]] degree whose title is jointly offered together with University of Turin,  University of Eastern Peadmont and Collegio Carlo Alberto.  
From Academic Year 2016-2017, after its first ten years of existence, IUC offers an entirely newly designed Master of Research in Food Law and Finance. The program, in English, is open to an international students and develops a highly interdisciplinary approach to the Food Chain and its financialization. The degree is granted jointly with the Università Scienze Gastronomiche, established in Pollenzo by Slow Food. A special focus of teaching and research at IUC has traditionally been the study and active defence of water and the commons.

The IUC is a center for the interdisciplinary and critical study of law, economics, finance and the commons. Teachers and students from all over the world (since 2008, over 300 students from 66 countries) gather in Turin to examine the phenomenon of [[globalization]] with a particular attention to the conception of achievable long-period policies to govern its effects. To do so, research at the IUC explores the great variety of financial and institutional settings across the world in their analogies and differences to obtain a more realistic and scientific grasp on current global transformations. A successful example of this approach is the IUC Report "At the End of the End of History. Global Legal Standards: Part of the Solution or Part of the Problem?",&lt;ref name="EndOfEndOfHistory" /&gt; which was presented at the Seminar "Global Standards in the 21st Century" organized by the [[G8|G-8]] Presidency in Rome in May 2009. The Report calls for a broader understanding of markets and the structural impact of legal institutions on their unfolding needs, and issues a challenge to the biases produced by mainstream theory, while proposing innovative solutions for the harms caused by the recent financial and economic crisis.
The teaching and scholarly interest for the commons as an institutional setting for a more ecologically compatible anthropocene has been the most recognisable trademark of IUC. More than 95% of IUC Alumni have received the sort of financial aid that equals free education, allowing the IUC to be one of the few really accessible global institutions of higher education.

==Faculty and academic partnership==

The faculty at IUC is a mix of younger academics on a full-time basis and of stellar Associate faculty collaborators including [[Guido Calabresi]] (former Dean of the [[Yale Law School]]), [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]] ([[Harvard Law School]]), Joseph Halevi, (Emeritus of Sidney University), Jan Toporowsky (SOAS), Gunther Frankenberg (Frankfurt).

'''Justice and the Poor''' was an article on law and ethics first published in 1919, promoting the concept of free legal assistance for the poor. It was written by [[Reginald Heber Smith]], director of the Boston Legal Aid Society.&lt;ref&gt;''Law and Society'', Matthew Lippman, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith challenged the legal profession to consider it an obligation to see that access to justice was available to all, without regard to ability to pay.  "Without equal access to the law," he wrote, "the system not only robs the poor of their only protection, but places in the hands of their oppressors the most powerful and ruthless weapon ever invented."&lt;ref&gt;''Justice and the Poor'', Reginald Heber Smith, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As a result of Smith's book, the [[American Bar Association]] created the Special Committee on Legal Aid Work.  By the middle of the 20th century, virtually every major metropolitan area had some kind of legal aid program.

'''''Law and Critique''''' (print: {{ISSN|0957-8536}}, online: {{ISSN|1572-8617}}) is a triannual [[law journal]] closely involved with the [[critical legal studies]] community. It was established in 1990 and is associated with the [[Critical Legal Conference]]. ''Law and Critique'' takes a critical perspective on all aspects of [[legal theory]], [[jurisprudence]], and [[substantive law]] and covers the influences of a variety of schools of thought into legal scholarship (such as [[postmodernism]], [[feminism]], [[queer theory]], [[critical race theory]], literary approaches to law, [[psychoanalysis]], law and the humanities, law and [[aesthetics]], and [[post-colonialism]]).

It is not affiliated with any law school.

==List of former trademarks that have since become generic terms due to reasons other than genericization==
The following partial list contains marks which were originally legally protected [[trademark]]s, but which have subsequently lost legal protection as trademarks due to abandonment, non-renewal or improper issuance (the generic term predated the registration). Some marks retain trademark protection in certain countries despite being generic in others.

==List of protected trademarks frequently used as generic terms==
Marks in this partial list are still legally protected as trademarks, at least in some jurisdictions, but are sometimes used by consumers in a generic sense. Unlike the names in the list above, these names are still widely known by the public as brand names, and are not used by competitors. Scholars disagree as to whether the use of a recognized trademark name for similar products can truly be called "generic", or if it is instead a form of [[synecdoche]].&lt;ref name=Butters&gt;Butters, Ronald R. and Jennifer Westerhaus. "Linguistic change in words one owns: How trademarks become 'generic'" in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VWkfaTRQa5YC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=kleenex+generic&amp;sig=ACfU3U1IozbCHr5IJG7XW08OaEDI-cAlEw#PPA118,M1 Studies in the History of the English Language II]'', Anne Curzan and Kimberly Emmons, eds. Walter de Gruyter, 2004 Retrieved 2008-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous list contains trademarks that have completely lost their legal status in some countries, while the following list contains marks which have been registered as trademarks, continue in use, and are actively enforced by their trademark owners. Writing guides such as the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'' advise writers to "use a generic equivalent unless the trademark is essential to the story".

Please note that other generic terms may be equally appropriate.

{{canon law}}
The '''matrimonial nullity trial reforms of Pope Francis''' are the reforms of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] governing such trials, made public 8 September 2015. The reforms were effected by two separate [[apostolic letter]]s&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/09/08/pope-francis-is-reforming-the-catholic-churchs-marriage-annulment-process/ Pope Francis announces biggest changes to annulment process in centuries], The Washington Post, accessed 8 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Pope Francis]], the [[motu proprio]] ''[[List of Motu Proprium|Mitis iudex dominus Iesus]]'' amending the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], and the motu proprio ''[[List of Motu Proprium|Mitis et misericors Iesus]]'' amending the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/09/08/pope_francis_reforms_church_law_in_marital_nullity_trials/1170336 Pope Francis reforms Church law in marital nullity trials], Vatican Radio, accessed 8 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This was in response to the Bishops who, during the [[Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|Synod on the Family of]] 5-9 October 2014, called for simplification of the procedure whereby a legally invalid marriage is declared null.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libweb.hofstra.edu:2082/search~S1?/dDivorce+%28Canon+law%29/ddivorce+canon+law/1%2C2%2C3%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=ddivorce+canon+law&amp;1%2C%2C2|title=Articles from Catholic University of America Workshop, March 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the press conference announcing the reforms, Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, the president of the [[Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts]], emphasized that the Church does not decree the "annulment" of a legally valid marriage, but rather declares the "nullity" of a legally invalid marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/09/08/press_conference_details_marriage_law_reforms/1170376 Press conference details marriage law reforms], Vatican Radio, accessed 8 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of the reforms==
There are three main reforms:&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/07/living/pope-francis-annulments-preview/ Pope Francis makes annulment of marriages cheaper and easier], CNN.com, accessed 8 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
# A cleric's "second review" before nullity can be declared was eliminated.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
# Bishops now have the authority to declare nullity themselves, and in a more efficient manner.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
# The process should be ''gratis'', as long as the tribunal workers can still be paid a just wage.&lt;ref name="Madison Diocese"/&gt;

The reforms [[vacatio legis|took legal effect]] on 8 December 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.catholic.com/blog/jimmy-akin/pope-francis-reforms-annulment-process-9-things-to-know-and-share Pope Francis Reforms Annulment Process: 9 things to know and share], Catholic Answers, accessed 8 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedited process may take as few as 120 days.&lt;ref name="Madison Diocese"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madisondiocese.org/DioceseofMadison/FAQaboutrevisedmarriagenullityprocess.aspx |title=Frequently Asked Questions Re: Mitis Iudex Dominus Iesus |accessdate=16 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913000300/http://madisondiocese.org/DioceseofMadison/FAQaboutrevisedmarriagenullityprocess.aspx |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the reforms==
The reforms were proposed by a group of experts in matrimonial jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; According to experts at the Vatican, they are the most expansive revision in matrimonial nullity jurisprudence in centuries.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The reforms move away from 18th century matrimonial nullity reforms of the canonist [[Pope Benedict XIV]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Reception==
[[Austen Ivereigh]] described the reforms as "revolutionary" and says that they are the broadest reforms in 300 years.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Kurt Martens, a [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] professor, worries that the reduction in procedure will not guarantee a fair trial.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; He likened the reforms to the Catholic Church providing a means of no-fault divorce.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In an article published by conservative religious journal ''[[First Things]]'', Martens stated that many Italian jurists fear that there might be a spike in conflicts between the canonical, Italian, and European Union judicial systems, since the reforms abolish a number of "basic due process norms" which are neither respected nor acknowledged. In his view, this renders the canonical judicial system "incompatible" with modern judicial procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2015/12/new-norms-for-marriage-nullity New Norms for Marriage Nullity], Kurt Martens, 4 December 2015; accessed 6 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Cardinal [[Raymond Leo Burke|Raymond Burke]], former Prefect of the [[Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura]], raised concerns over the prudence of the reforms, stating that [[Pope John Paul II]], when preparing the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], had rejected many of the same reforms accepted by [[Pope Francis]], and cited the centuries of development of the former nullity trial process regarding legal certainty of the truth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/cardinal-burke-had-grave-reservations-on-the-same-annulment-proposals-pope Cardinal Burke had grave reservations on the same annulment proposals Pope Francis just enshrined], Retrieved 9 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Francis reflected after the 2014 Synod on the Family that: "A great number of synod fathers emphasized the need to make the procedure in cases of nullity more accessible and less time-consuming, and, if possible, at no expense."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Between 1970 and 1983 the United States bishops had experimented with the possibility of one rather than two hearings and 90% of the cases were decided without the second tribunal. But the Code of Canon Law of 1983 eliminated this possibility, now restored through Pope Francis' revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/the-vaticans-new-policy-on-annulments-the-first-hint-of-shake-ups-to-come/404182/|title=Thanks to Pope Francis, It's Now Easier to Get Your Marriage Officially Annulled in the Church|last=Green|first=Emma|work=The Atlantic|access-date=15 July 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others saw that "Putting the poor at the centre is what distinguishes the reform of Pope Francis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.catholicweekly.com.au/pope-francis-reforms-annulment-process/|title=Pope Francis reforms annulment process|date=10 September 2015|work=The Catholic Weekly|access-date=15 July 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the ''[[motu proprio]]'': "Care is to be taken that everyone, parties or witnesses, can participate in the process at a minimum of cost."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/motu_proprio/documents/papa-francesco-motu-proprio_20150815_mitis-iudex-dominus-iesus.html|title=Apostolic Letter Motu Proprio Mitis Iudex Dominus Iesus by which the canons of the Code of Canon Law pertaining to cases regarding the nullity of marriage are reformed (15 August 2015) {{!}} Francis|last=|first=|date=|website=w2.vatican.va|at=Article 7,2|access-date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''McDonald's Corporation v Steel &amp; Morris''''' [1997] EWHC QB 366, known as "the '''McLibel case'''", was an English [[lawsuit]] for [[libel]] filed by [[McDonald's|McDonald's Corporation]] against [[environmentalism|environmental]] activists Helen Steel and David Morris (often referred to as "The McLibel Two") over a factsheet critical of the company. Each of two [[hearing (law)|hearings]] in English courts found some of the leaflet's contested claims to be libellous and others to be true. The partial nature of the victory, the [[David and Goliath|David-and-Goliath]] nature of the case, and the drawn-out litigation embarrassed McDonald's.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The original case lasted nearly ten years which, according to the [[BBC]], made it the longest-running libel case in English history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=McLibel pair get police payout | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/820786.stm | date=5 July 2000}} {{cite news  | title='McLibel' pair in fresh court bid | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3632944.stm | date=7 September 2004}} {{cite news  | title=McLibel: Longest case in English history | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4266741.stm | date=15 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's announced it did not plan to collect the £40,000 it was awarded by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McDonald's lets McLibel case rest |publisher=AP |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071997/biz_mclibel.html |date=19 July 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006063257/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071997/biz_mclibel.html |archivedate=6 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the decision, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled in ''Steel &amp; Morris v United Kingdom'' the pair had been denied a fair trial, in breach of Article 6 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (right to a fair trial) and their conduct should have been protected by Article 10 of the Convention, which protects the right to freedom of expression.

The United Kingdom]" The [[European Court of Human Rights]], 15 February 2005. Received 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's itself was not involved in, or a party to, this action, as applications to the ECHR are independent cases filed against the relevant [[Sovereign state|state]].

In 2013 it was revealed that one of the authors of the "McLibel leaflet", [[Bob Lambert (undercover police officer)|Bob Lambert]], had been an undercover police officer who had infiltrated [[London Greenpeace]]. In 2016 it was revealed that a second undercover police officer, John Dines, had a sexual, romantic relationship with Helen Steel.

[[Franny Armstrong]] and [[Ken Loach]] made a documentary film, ''[[McLibel (film)|McLibel]]'', about the case.

==History==

===Background===
[[London Greenpeace]] was a small environmental campaigning group which existed between 1972 and 2001. They were not affiliated with the larger [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace International]] organisation, which they declined to join as they saw it being too "centralised and mainstream for their tastes".&lt;ref name="second"&gt;pg 388 of ''No Logo''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libel charges===
In 1990, McDonald's brought [[Slander and libel|libel]] proceedings against five London Greenpeace supporters, Paul Gravett, Andrew Clarke and Jonathan O'Farrell, as well as Steel and Morris, for distributing the sheet on the streets of London. This case followed past instances in which McDonald's threatened to sue more than fifty organisations for libel, including [[Channel 4]] television and several major publications. In all such cases, the media outlets settled, and offered apologies for the alleged libel.&lt;ref&gt;"Over the past 15 years, McDonald's has threatened legal action against more than 90 organisations in the U.K., including the [[BBC]], [[Channel 4]], the ''Guardian'', ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', the [[Scottish TUC]], the New Leaf Shop, student newspapers, and a children's theatre group. Even [[Prince Philip]] received a stiff letter. All of them backed down and many formally apologised in court." from "Why Won't British TV Show a Film about McLibel?", Franny Armstrong, 19 June 1998, ''[[The Guardian]]''; as quoted in ''No Logo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[English defamation law]], the defendant must show that each disparaging statement made is substantively true. This can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Three of the charged individuals (Gravett, Clarke and O'Farrell) chose to apologise as requested by McDonald's. Steel and Morris, however, chose to defend the case.&lt;ref&gt;Skau, S. (2013) McLibel. followthethings.com (www.followthethings.com/mclibel.shtml) Accessed 16 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two were denied [[Legal Aid]], as was policy for libel cases, despite having very limited income.&lt;ref name="jobs"&gt;"For 313 days in court - the longest trial in English history - an unemployed postal worker (Morris) and a community gardener (Steel) went to war with chief executives from the largest food empire in the world." pg 389 of ''No Logo''&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, they had to represent themselves, though they received significant [[pro bono]] assistance. Steel and Morris called 180 witnesses, seeking to prove their assertions about [[food poisoning]], unpaid [[overtime]], misleading claims about how much McDonald's [[recycling|recycled]], and "corporate spies sent to infiltrate the ranks of London Greenpeace".&lt;ref&gt;pg 389 of ''No Logo''&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's spent several million pounds, while Steel and Morris spent £30,000; this disparity in funds meant Steel and Morris were not able to call all the witnesses they wanted, especially witnesses from South America who were intended to support their claims about McDonald's activities in that continent's rainforests.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;McLibel film, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In its libel allegation, McDonald's asserted all claims in the pamphlet as being false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/pretrial/state%27o%27claim.html |title=Statement of Claim |publisher=Mcspotlight.org |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found it difficult to support this position despite the indirectness of some of the claims. The case eventually became a [[media circus]]. McDonald's executives, including [[Ray Cesca]], entered the witness box, enabling cross-examination by the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vidal|first=john|title=McLibel: British Culture on Trial|publisher=The New Press|date=1997|pages=11–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1995 McDonald's offered to settle the case (which "was coming up to its [tenth] anniversary in court"&lt;ref name="first"&gt;pg 387 of ''No Logo'', 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt;) by donating a large sum of money to a charity chosen by the two. They further specified they would drop the case if Steel and Morris agreed to "stop criticising McDonald's".&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; Steel and Morris secretly recorded the meeting, in which McDonald's said the pair could criticise McDonald's privately to friends but must cease talking to the media or distributing leaflets. Steel and Morris wrote a letter in response saying they would agree to the terms if McDonald's ceased advertising its products and instead only recommended the restaurant privately to friends.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Judgment===

====High Court====
The case was adjudicated by Hon. Mr Justice Rodger Bell.&lt;ref&gt;Bell J had never tried, or acted as a barrister in, a libel case. His area of law had been primarily professional negligence, and so it has been felt by many that he was "led" by Richard Rampton QC, for McDonald's, throughout most of the case.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 1997, Bell delivered a more than 1,000-page decision largely in favour of McDonald's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j379/mcdonalds_190697.htm |title=The Court Service - Queens Bench Division - Judgment - McDonald's Corporation &amp; McDonald's Restaurants Limited against Helen Marie Steel &amp; David Morris |publisher=Hmcourts-service.gov.uk |accessdate=13 November 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605062408/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j379/mcdonalds_190697.htm |archivedate = 5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarised by a 45-page paper read in court.&lt;ref&gt;"On 19 June 1997, the judge finally handed down the verdict....It felt like an eternity to most of us sitting there, as Judge Rodger Bell read out his forty-five-page ruling - a summary of the actual verdict, which was over a thousand pages long. Although the judge deemed most of the factsheet's claims too hyperbolic to be acceptable (he was particularly unconvinced by its direct linking of McDonald's to "hunger in the 'Third World'"), he deemed others to be based on pure fact." pg 389-390 of ''No Logo''.&lt;/ref&gt; Steel and Morris were found liable on several points, but the judge also found some of the points in the factsheet were true.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; McDonald's considered this a legal victory, though it was tempered by the judge's endorsement of some of the allegations in the sheet. Specifically, Bell ruled McDonald's endangered the [[health]] of their workers and customers by "misleading advertising", and they "exploit children", that they were "culpably responsible" in the infliction of unnecessary [[cruelty to animals]], and they were "antipathetic"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/verdict10_sum.html|title=SUMMARY OF THE JUDGEMENT / Employment practices|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Trade union|unionisation]] and paid their workers low wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/quotes.html | date = 19 June 1997| title = Judgement Day Verdict - Highlights | publisher = McSpotlight | accessdate = 14 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although the decision awarded £60,000 to the company, McDonald's legal costs were much greater, and the defendants lacked the funds to pay it. Steel and Morris immediately appealed against the decision.&lt;ref name="BBC payout"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/820786.stm |title=McLibel pair get police payout |first=BBC |last=News |accessdate=12 May 2007 | date=5 July 2000 |authorlink=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 a documentary film was made about the case, also titled [[McLibel (film)|''McLibel'']]. This was updated in 2005 after the verdict of the final appeal.

In September 1998, the pair sued the [[Metropolitan Police]] for disclosing confidential information to investigators hired by McDonald's and received £10,000 and an apology for the alleged disclosure.&lt;ref name="BBC payout" /&gt;

====Court of Appeal====
An appeal began on 12 January 1999 and lasted 23 court days, ending on 26 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/msc_6jan99.html |title=Press Release - McLibel Support Campaign; 6 January 1999 |publisher=Mcspotlight.org |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was heard in Court 1 of the Court of Appeal in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]]. The case was adjudicated by Lord Justices Pill and May and Mr Justice Keane. The defendants represented themselves in court, assisted by first year law student Kalvin P. Chapman ([[King's College London]]). McDonald's were represented by libel lawyer [[Richard Rampton|Richard Rampton QC]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onebrickcourt.com/barristers.asp?id=20 One Brick Court - Barristers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and a junior barrister, Timothy Atkinson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/people/biogs/atkinson.html Curriculum Vitae - Timothy Atkinson]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ms Pattie Brinley-Codd of Barlow, Lyde &amp; Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/people/biogs/brinley_codd.html Curriculum Vitae - Patti Brinley-Codd]&lt;/ref&gt; Steel and Morris filed a 63-point appeal. They had requested a time extension, but were denied. The verdict for the appeal was handed down on 31 March, in Court 1 at the Royal Courts of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/msc_25mar99.html Press Release - McLibel Support Campaign; 25 March 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges ruled it was fair comment to say that McDonald's employees worldwide "do badly in terms of pay and conditions"&lt;ref&gt;[Appeal Judgment p247]&lt;/ref&gt; and true "if one eats enough McDonald's food, one's diet may well become high in fat, etc., with the very real risk of heart disease". They further stated the last finding "must have a serious effect on their trading reputation since it goes to the very business in which they are engaged. In our judgment, it must have a greater impact on the respondents' [McDonald's] reputation than any other of the charges that the trial judge had found to be true".&lt;ref&gt;[Judgment p264]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The Court of Appeal also stated that it had "considerable sympathy" with the defendants' submissions that the leaflet meant "that there is a respectable body of medical opinion which links a junk food diet with a risk of cancer and heart disease", that 'this link was accepted both in literature published by McDonald's themselves and by one or more of McDonald's own experts and in medical publications of high repute', and that therefore 'that should have been an end of this part of the case'.&lt;ref&gt;[p169]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} They ruled against the defendants on the allegation that McDonald's food was a [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref&gt;[p170-2]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

As a result of their further findings against the Corporation, the three Lord Justices reduced Mr Justice Bell's award of £60,000 damages to McDonald's by £20,000. The court ruled against the argument by Steel and Morris that multinational corporations should no longer be able to sue for libel over [[public interest]] issues; they believed "that may be seen as an argument of some substance", but ultimately rejected it, on grounds that it was a matter for Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[p287]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}  Steel and Morris announced their intention to appeal over these and other points to the [[House of Lords]], and then take the [[UK Government|UK government]] to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] if necessary.

In response to the verdict, [[David Pannick, Baron Pannick|David Pannick QC]] said in ''[[The Times]]'': "The McLibel case has achieved what many lawyers thought impossible: to lower further the reputation of our law in the minds of all right thinking people."&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 24 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel and Morris appealed to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Law Lords]], arguing that their right to legal aid had been unjustly denied. When the Law Lords refused to accept the case, the pair formally retained [[solicitor]] [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article515008.ece|title=McDonald's gets a taste of defeat as Europe backs the McLibel Two|publisher=Times newspapers|date=16 February 2005|accessdate=29 January 2011|location=London|first=Frances|last=Gibb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[barrister]] (later [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] (England and Wales)), [[Keir Starmer]] QC to file a case with the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR), contesting the UK government's policy that legal aid was not available in libel cases, and setting out a highly detailed case for what they believed to be the oppressive and unfair nature of UK libel laws in general, and in their case in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/Echr.html European Court of Human Rights Application&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, this action was heard by the ECHR. Lawyers for Steel and Morris argued that the lack of legal aid had breached the pair's right to freedom of expression and to a fair trial.

====European Court of Human Rights====
[[File:Anti-McDonalds protest Leicester Square London 20041016.jpg|thumb|right|An anti-McDonald’s leafleting campaign in front of the McDonald’s restaurant in Leicester Square, London, during the European Social Forum season, 16-10-2004.]]
On 15 February 2005, the European Court of Human Rights ruled&lt;ref name="echr"&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-68224  CASE OF STEEL AND MORRIS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM (Application no. 68416/01): JUDGMENT]&lt;/ref&gt; that the original case had breached Article 6 (right to a fair trial) and Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and ordered that the UK government pay Steel and Morris £57,000 in compensation. In their ruling, the ECHR criticised the way in which UK laws had failed to protect the public right to criticise corporations whose business practices affect people's lives and the environment (which violates Article 10); they also ruled that the trial was biased because of the defendants' comparative lack of resources and what they believed were complex and oppressive UK libel laws.

In particular the Court held:
{{quote|in a democratic society even small and informal campaign groups, such as London Greenpeace, must be able to carry on their activities effectively and that there exists a strong public interest in enabling such groups and individuals outside the mainstream to contribute to the public debate by disseminating information and ideas on matters of general public interest such as health and the environment.|ECJR judgement, para. 89&lt;ref name="echr"/&gt;}}
{{quote|The safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (...), and the same principle must apply to others who engage in public debate.|ECHR judgement, para. 90&lt;ref name="echr"/&gt;}}
{{quote|It is true that large public companies inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their acts and, as in the case of the businessmen and women who manage them, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider in the case of such companies.|ECHR judgement, para. 94&lt;ref name="echr"/&gt;}}

In response to the European Court of Human Rights' decision, Steel and Morris issued the following press release:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Having largely beaten McDonald's... we have now exposed the notoriously oppressive and unfair UK laws. As a result of the... ruling today, the government may be forced to amend or scrap some of the existing UK laws. We hope that this will result in greater public scrutiny and criticism of powerful organisations whose practices have a detrimental effect on society and the environment. The McLibel campaign has already proved that determined and widespread grass roots protests and defiance can undermine those who try to silence their critics, and also render oppressive laws unworkable. The continually growing opposition to McDonald's and all it stands for is a vindication of all the efforts of those around the world who have been exposing and challenging the corporation's business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/releases/msc150205.html

===Post court developments===
In the course of the [[UK undercover policing relationships scandal]] it was revealed that one of the authors of the "McLibel leaflet" was [[Bob Lambert (undercover police officer)|Bob Lambert]], an undercover police officer who infiltrated [[London Greenpeace]]; John Dines, another undercover officer, was also Helen Steel's partner for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McLibel leaflet was co-written by undercover police officer Bob Lambert |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/mclibel-leaflet-police-bob-lambert-mcdonalds|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 June 2013|first=Paul|last=Lewis|author2=Rob Evans|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/09/undercover-uk-police-spy-apologises-after-being-tracked-down-by-woman-he-deceived|title=Undercover UK police spy apologises after being tracked down by woman he deceived|publisher=The Guardian|author= Paul Farrell and Rob Evans|date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Defamation Act 2013]] brought some changes to libel cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/assembly-business/official-report/committee-minutes-of-evidence/session-2012-2013/july-2013/defamation-act-2013-libel-reform-campaign-briefing/|title=Defamation Act 2013: Libel Reform Campaign Briefing}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were expected to make it harder for corporations to abuse libel law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/6-may-2013/can-new-act-clean-up-libel-law/|author=Matt Byrne|title=Can new Act clean up libel law?|date=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The McLibel case also raised awareness about how defamation proceedings can harm the reputation of companies which raise them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaronandpartners.com/defamation-act-2013/|title=Defamation Act 2013|date=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[Streisand effect]].

==McDonald's response==
The ''McLibel'' film quoted McDonald's as offering little comment on the European Court decision other than to point out that it was the Government and not McDonald's who was the losing party and that "times have changed and so has McDonald's".

On a website aiming to state its view on issues raised about it, McDonald's stated that the case is in the past and the issues more so, and that both sides in it have moved on (although Morris and Steel did continue related litigation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/15/food.foodanddrink&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Skau, S. (2013) McLibel. www.followthethings.com/mclibel.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
A feature-length documentary film, ''[[McLibel (film)|McLibel]]'', was made about the case by [[Franny Armstrong]] and [[Ken Loach]] in 1997. An extended version was produced in 2005.

[[File:MediterraneanPassport1820.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Mediterranean passport from 1820]]
The '''Mediterranean pass''' (or '''Mediterranean passport''', the name used in the United States) was a document which identified a ship as being  protected under a treaty with states of the [[Barbary Coast]].  Now known as the [[Barbary pirate]]s, these states required countries to pay tribute in exchange for not capturing that country's ships and crews.  These passes identified ships which had safe passage.&lt;ref name="NavyBarbaryI"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top of the British document was [[indenture|cut off in an erratic scalloped pattern]] used to confirm its authenticity.  The matching top of the document was sent to officials along the Barbary Coast, so [[cruiser]]s from those ports would have samples for comparison with the edge of the documents.  A similar design was adopted by the United States, although U.S. Consul General in Algiers Richard O'Brien pointed out the document should be on thicker paper (or parchment) and kept in a tin container so as to ensure a better match between tops and bottoms (he also suggested that ships fly the [[American flag]] rather than the flags of individual states).&lt;ref name="NavyBarbaryI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Background ==
For about 300 years, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] lanes were largely controlled by the [[north Africa]]n Muslim states of the [[Barbary Coast]] (Tripoli, Algiers, [[Morocco]], and [[Tunis]]) through [[piracy]]. [[Hostage]]s were either [[ransom]]ed or sold into [[slavery]]. Over time, most countries found it expedient to simply pay a yearly [[tribute]] ([[bribe]]) to the Barbary [[sultan]]s in exchange for safe passage through the Mediterranean.

Following the [[American Revolution]], America was no longer under the protection of the British tribute treaties, resulting in the crippling of American commerce in the Mediterranean. Having no significant [[United States Navy|navy]], the U.S. decided to form tribute treaties with the Barbary states, such as the 1796 [[Treaty of Tripoli]].  This treaty required ship's passports within 18 months.

[[File:Drug-Packer X-Ray.jpg|thumb|Plain radiograph of the abdomen of a drug "mule" showing drug capsules]]
[[File:Bodypacks.jpg|thumb|German Customs Officer with seized cocaine containers (Bodypacks)]]
A '''mule''' or '''courier''' is someone who personally [[smuggling|smuggles]] [[contraband]] across a border (as opposed to sending by mail, etc.) for a [[smuggling organization]]. The organizers employ mules to reduce the risk of getting caught themselves. Methods of smuggling include hiding the goods in vehicles or carried items, attaching them to one's [[human body|body]], or using the body as a container.

In the case of [[illegal drug trade|transporting illegal drugs]], the term '''drug mule''' applies. Other slang terms include [[Kinder Surprise]] and [[Easter Egg]].  Small-scale operations, in which one courier carries one piece or a very small quantity, are sometimes called the '''ant trade'''.

==Techniques==

===Concealment===
Methods of smuggling include hiding the goods in a vehicle,&lt;ref name=DEA/&gt; luggage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://mensnewsdaily.com/2006/03/20/panamanian-drug-gang-and-swallowers-nailed-by-nypd/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204145933/http://mensnewsdaily.com/2006/03/20/panamanian-drug-gang-and-swallowers-nailed-by-nypd/ | archive-date = February 4, 2012 | title = Panamanian Drug Gang and "Swallowers" Nailed by NYPD | date = March 20, 2006 | first = Jim | last = Kouri | publisher = Mens News Daily | work = mensnewsdaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or clothes.&lt;ref name=DEA&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.dea.gov/pubs/cngrtest/ct110905.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051210020757/http://www.dea.gov/pubs/cngrtest/ct110905.html | archive-date = December 10, 2005 | title = Statement of Michael A. Braun, Chief of Operations, Drug Enforcement Administration, Before the House International Relations Committee, Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, November 9, 2005 – “The Illicit Drug Transit Zone in Central America” | date = November 9, 2005 | publisher = U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a vehicle, the contraband is hidden in secret compartments.&lt;ref name=DEA/&gt;

Sometimes the goods are hidden in the bag or vehicle of an innocent person, who does not know about the contraband, for the purpose of retrieving the goods elsewhere.

Some contraband is legal to possess but is subject to [[Import tax|taxes]] or other import restrictions, such as [[second-hand clothes]] and [[computer]]s, and the purpose of the smuggling is to get around these restrictions.  In this case, smuggling may be done in plain sight, in smaller quantities, so that a suitcase full of used clothes or a new computer can be passed off as a personal possession rather than an importing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/platform/amp/2018/3/13/17082288/used-clothing-mexico-goodwill|title=Here’s What Really Happens to Your Used Clothes - Racked|last=Guo|first=Eileen|date=13 March 2018|website=www.racked.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body packing===
The practice of transporting goods outside or inside of the body is called body packing. This is done by a person usually called a mule, or bait. The contraband is attached to the outside of the body using [[adhesive tape]], [[glue]], or [[straps]], often in such places as between the cheeks of the buttocks or between rolls of fat. Other inconspicuous places, like the soles of cut out shoes, inside belts, or the rim of a hat, were used more often prior to the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Due to increased airport security the "body packing" method is rarely used any more.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Some narcotics-trafficking organizations such as the Mexican Cartels will purposely send one or two people with drugs on the outside of their body to purposely be caught, so that the authorities are occupied while dozens of mules pass by undetected with drugs inside their body.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, even these diversion tactics are becoming less and less prevalent as airport security increases.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Swallowing===
[[File:Bolletjes.jpg|thumb|Abdominal [[X-ray]] showing swallowed packages of cocaine.]]
This is often done using a mule's [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] or other [[Body cavity|body cavities]] as containers. Swallowing has been used for the transportation of [[heroin]],&lt;ref name=DEA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thai/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pediatric/&gt; [[cocaine]],&lt;ref name=USU/&gt; and [[MDMA|MDMA/Ecstasy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Australasian Radiol |last1=Low |volume=49 |first1=VHS |issue=5 |last2=Dillon |first2=EK |title=Agony of the ecstasy: Report of five cases of MDMA smuggling |pages=400–3 |date=October 2005 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1673.2005.01503.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1673.2005.01503.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A swallower typically fills tiny balloons with small quantities of a drug. The balloons may be made with multilayered [[condom]]s, fingers of [[Medical glove|latex glove]]s,&lt;ref name=USU/&gt; or more sophisticated hollow [[Pelletizing|pellets]]. One smuggling method involves swallowing the balloons, which are recovered later from the excreted [[feces]]. Alternately, the balloons may be hidden in other natural or artificial body cavities – such as [[rectum]],&lt;ref name=USU&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rad.usuhs.edu/medpix/cow_image.php?mode=case_viewer&amp;imageid=51652&amp;pt_id=13303&amp;quiz=no#top | title = Cocaine overdose secondary to rupture of latex cocaine packet | first = Sonja I | last = Parisek | publisher = [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]] | quote = Dx by: Abdominal radiograph, physical evidence of packet, exploratory laparotomy to remove additional packets, sigmoidoscopy....

A drug mule may swallow dozens upon dozens of balloons.&lt;ref name=Pediatric/&gt; The swallower then attempts to cross international borders, excrete the balloons, and sell the drugs.

It is most common for the swallower to be making the trip on behalf of a drug lord or drug dealer. Swallowers are often impoverished and agree to transport the drugs in exchange for money or other favors. In fewer cases, the drug dealers can attempt [[extortion]] against people by threatening physical harm against friends or family, but the more common practice is for swallowers to willingly accept the job in exchange for big payoffs. As reported in ''Lost Rights'' by [[James Bovard]]: "Nigerian drug lords have employed an army of 'swallowers', those who will swallow as many as 150 balloons and smuggle drugs into the [[United States]]. Given the [[per capita]] yearly income of [[Nigeria]] is $2,100, Nigerians can collect as much as $15,000 per trip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bovard | first = James | title = Lost Rights: the Destruction of American Liberty | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0312123338 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan Trade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swallowers have been apprehended from a variety of age groups, including adults, teens, and children.&lt;ref name=Pediatric&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://opioids.com/heroin/pediatric.html | title = Pediatric "body packing" | last1 = Traub | first1 = SJ | last2 = Kohn | first2 = GL | last3 = Hoffman | first3 = RS | last4 = Nelson | first4 = LS | location = Department of Emergency Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA | journal = Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med | date = February 2003  | volume = 157 | issue = 2 | pages = 174–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection and medical treatment==
Routine detection of the smuggled packets is extremely difficult, and many cases come to light because a packet has ruptured or because of intestinal obstruction. Unruptured packets may sometimes be detected by rectal or vaginal examination, but the only reliable way is by X-ray of the abdomen. Hashish appears denser than stool, cocaine is approximately the same density as stool, while heroin looks like air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00330-003-2091-5 |vauthors=Hergan K, Kofler K, Oser W |title=Drug smuggling by body packing: what radiologists should know about it|journal=Eur Radiol|year=2004|volume=14|issue=4|pages=736–42 |pmid=14566426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasingly popular type of swallowing involves having the drug in the form of liquid-filled balloons or condoms/packages. These are impossible to detect unless the airport has high-sensitivity X-Ray equipment, as a liquid mixture of water and the drug will most likely not be detected using a standard X-Ray machine. Most of the major airports in Europe, Canada, and the US have the more sensitive machines.

In most cases, it is only necessary to wait for the packets to [[defecation|pass normally]], but if a packet ruptures or if there is intestinal obstruction, then it may be necessary to operate and surgically remove the packets.&lt;ref name="NEJM2004"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM200403183501220|vauthors=Dueñas-Laita A, Nogué S, Burillo-Putze G |title=Body packing|journal=N Engl J Med | year=2004 | volume=350 | pages=1260–1 | pmid=15028835 | issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil-based laxatives should never be used, as they can weaken the latex of condoms and cause packets to rupture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMra022719|vauthors=Traub SJ, Hoffman RS, Nelson LS |title=Body packing—the internal concealment of illicit drugs|pmid=14695412|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2003|volume=349|issue=26|pages=2519–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emetics like [[syrup of ipecac]], enemas, and endoscopic retrieval all carry a risk of packet rupture and should not be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(02)00505-X|vauthors=Pidoto RR, Agliata AM, Bertoline R, Mainini A, Rossi G, Giani G |title=A new method of packaging cocaine for international traffic and implications for the management of cocaine body-packers|pmid=12359282|journal=J Emerg Med|year=2002|volume=23|issue=2|pages=149–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeat imaging is only necessary if the mule does not know the packet count.

Ruptured packets can be fatal and often require treatment as for a drug overdose and may require admission to an intensive care unit. Body packers are not always reliable sources of information about the contents of the packages (either because of fears about information being passed on to law enforcement agencies or because the mule genuinely does not know). Urine toxicology may be necessary to determine what drugs are being carried and what antidotes are needed.&lt;ref name=Thai&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16583590 | title = Fatal Heroin Intoxication in Body Packers in Northern Thailand during the Last Decade: Two Case Reports | last1 = Sribanditmongkol | first1 = P | last2 = Supasingsiripreecha | first2 = W | last3 = Thampitak | first3 = S | last4 = Junkuy | first4 = A | journal = J Med Assoc Thai | date = January 2006 | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 106–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEJM2004"/&gt;

==International incidents==
&lt;!-- Countries should be arranged in alphabetical order. --&gt;

===People's Republic of China===
Electronic products such as [[iPhones]] sell cheaper in [[Hong Kong]], one of China's [[Special Administrative Region]]s where the tax laws are relaxed. Smugglers buy them in Hong Kong and employ mules that strap iPhones around their waists and ankles and smuggle them across the border from Hong Kong to [[Shenzhen]]. According to Customs Law of China and Smuggling Penalties, a person shall be subject to a criminal charge if found smuggling small quantities of goods three times in one year. The maximum jail sentence is three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNQp0lHHAk4 | title = iPhone Mules Attempt to Smuggle Tech into China | publisher = Mashable | date = March 5, 2012 | first = Lauren | last = Goren }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://szdaily.sznews.com/html/2012-03/01/content_1945051.htm | title = Man in jail for multiple smugglings | author = Li Hao | location = Shenzhen | work = Shenzhen Daily | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903074251/http://szdaily.sznews.com/html/2012-03/01/content_1945051.htm | archivedate = 2014-09-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] dealt with body packing in ''[[United States v. Montoya De Hernandez]]''. In ''Hernandez'', a woman attempted to smuggle 88 balloons of cocaine in her gastrointestinal tract. She had been detained for over 16 hours by customs inspectors before she finally passed some of the balloons. She was being held because her [[abdomen]] was noticeably swollen (she claimed to be [[pregnant]]), and a search of her body had revealed that she was wearing two pairs of elastic underpants and had lined her crotch area with paper towels. This is done because balloon swallowing makes [[bowel movement]]s difficult to control. The woman claimed her [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights had been violated, but the court found in favor of the border authorities.

With regard to traffic from South America to the US, the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] reports: "Unlike cocaine, heroin is often smuggled by people who swallow large numbers of small capsules (50–90), allowing them to transport up to 1.5 kilograms of heroin.

===United Kingdom===
In 2003, over 50% of foreign females in UK jails were drug mules from Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3097882.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jamaica's women drug mules fill UK jails | date=2003-09-13 | accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigerian women make a large contribution to the remaining figure.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In all, around 18% of the UK's female jail population are foreigners, 60% of whom are serving sentences for drug-related offences – most of them drug mules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4261934.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nigerian drug mules 'on the rise' | date=2005-10-03 | accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NYAS''' provides a safety net for people of all ages who have nowhere else to turn.

== Mission ==

NYAS provides a range of information, advocacy and legal services for children, young people and vulnerable adults to enable them to speak for themselves.  NYAS advocates and lawyers help clients to express their wishes and feelings and to participate in decision making and planning that affects their lives.  The charity also influences local and national policy makers and practitioners to acknowledge the legitimacy and importance of children's, young people's and vulnerable adult's rights. Formerly known as the National Youth Advocacy Service, the charity changed its name to NYAS in March 2012. NYAS works for the implementation of the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

== Services ==

NYAS provides separate representation for children and young people where a family court considers it necessary under the [[Family Procedure Rules|Family Procedure Rules 2010 (FPR)]]. Under FPR, ‘a child who is capable of forming his or her own views has the right to express those views in the proceedings with the views being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. The child should have the opportunity to have their situation represented separately from that of any of the adults.’

'''''Community Care Law, Public Law and Education Law.'''''NYAS has a contract with the [[Legal Services Commission|Legal Services Commission (LSC)]] to offer specialist help where there is a refusal by the local authority to undertake an assessment of community care needs or a failure to provide the necessary services under legislation such as [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990|The National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]].  NYAS also holds contracts with the LSC to offer help to anyone wishing to challenge the decision of a public authority.  This could be a complaint, an appeal to a tribunal or court proceedings such as a [[judicial review]] or obtaining an assessment and support for children and young people with [[Special education in the United Kingdom|special educational needs]].

=== 5. Separated Parents Information Programme ===

NYAS is a [[CAFCASS|Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS)]] approved provider of the [[Separated Parents Information Programme]] ([[Children and Adoption Act 2006|SPIP - Children and Adoption Act 2006]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5894">The [[New York (state)|New York]] '''Disability Benefits Law''' ('''DBL''') is article 9 of the Workers' Compensation Law (which is itself chapter 67 of the [[Consolidated Laws of New York]]) and creates a [[State disability benefits|state disability insurance]] program designed to provide employees with some level of income replacement in case of disability caused off-the-job.

==Eligibility==
To be required to have DBL coverage for its employees, a company must employ at least one person besides the proprietor within the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Full-time employees are eligible for coverage after four consecutive weeks of work, and part-time employees are eligible after their twenty-fifth day of employment.

Out of state employees can be covered under some DBL policies, but the employer must have some [[New York (state)|New York]] employees in order to attain DBL coverage.

==Cost and rates==
DBL [[insurance]] groups are divided up into those covering fewer than 50 employees and those with 50 or more employees.

Employers with less than 50 employees are written at rates which are fixed for all groups, but that vary from one insurance carrier to another. Rates for employers with less than 50 employees are usually written as a dollar cost per employee, per month. These rates are further divided into separate male and female rates (which are higher than the male rates), to reflect the impact that pregnancy has on DBL claims. Many carriers offer a discounted rate for employers willing to pay all of their premium at the beginning of the year. If a carrier offers this option, the rate will be expressed as a dollar amount per male per year, and per female per year.

Carriers are prevented by the state [[Worker's compensation]] Board from raising or lowering their rates for groups with fewer than 50 lives. If a carrier's overall loss ratio (claims paid divided by premium) for their groups with less than 50 employees is too low, then the [[Worker's compensation]] Board may force the carrier to lower their rates for all of the groups with fewer than 50 covered lives.

Employers with 50 or more employees are not given fixed rates, but will request a quote from various insurance carriers through an insurance agent or broker. These rates can vary considerably and are based on the overall risk factors of the case. Carriers are permitted to review these groups and increase or decrease the rates based on the claims paid to the group and the premiums that the group pays to the carrier. These reviews are generally conducted quarterly, and the carriers will issue letters to the policyholders and their insurance brokers indicating the proposed changes in rate.

Rates for cases with more than 50 employees are usually given as a dollar amount per employee, per month (called a "per capita rate") with no division into male- and female-specific rates, or as a dollar amount per $100 of covered payroll. Other, less common rate structures include offering a dollar amount per male and per female (as with the groups with less than 50 employees), and offering a dollar amount per $10 of benefit.

==Benefits==
As of 2006, DBL offers a benefit of 50% of weekly wages to a maximum of $170 per week of benefit. The normal waiting period for DBL benefits to start is seven days, and benefits can extend to a maximum duration of 26 weeks.

It is possible for carriers to offer benefits that extend beyond the statutory DBL coverage known as "enhanced" or "enriched" DBL. This extended coverage usually takes the form of a higher maximum benefit, but can also include shorter waiting periods or a longer maximum duration. Carriers take these factors into account when underwriting DBL coverage, and so enriched DBL is often more costly than statutory DBL coverage.

==Premium payment==
An employer is allowed, but not required, to collect contributions from its employees to offset the cost of providing benefits. An employee's contribution is computed at the rate of one-half of one percent of his/her wages, but no more than sixty cents a week (WCL §209).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcb.ny.gov/content/main/offthejob/IntroToLaw_DB.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paid Family Leave==
In 2016, Governor Cuomo signed into law the Paid Family Leave policy. Starting January 1, 2018, the New York State Paid Family Leave Program provides New Yorkers job-protected, paid leave to bond with a new child, care for a loved one with a serious health condition or to help relieve family pressures when someone is called to active military service. Coverage for this benefit will generally be provided as a rider to the DBL insurance policy. For employers who are not required to have DBL coverage, PFL coverage may be obtained on a stand-alone basis. (NYCRR 380).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ny.gov/programs/new-york-state-paid-family-leave&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcb.ny.gov/PFL/pfl-regs-text-summary-revised.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''North Coast Women's Care Medical Group vs. Superior Court''''' ({{law report|44|Cal. 4th|1145}}) is a case decided before the [[California Supreme Court]] on August 19, 2008, ruling that physicians must offer [[IUI]] infertility services to [[gay]]s and [[lesbian]]s despite religious objections or find a colleague in their office who will do so.

The suit was brought by Guadalupe Benitez, a lesbian from [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]], [[California]], who was treated in 1999 for infertility at the only clinic in her area that accepted her insurance. Two physicians at the North Coast Women's Care Medical Group, Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton, refused to perform an artificial insemination treatment on Benitez because they claimed that such treatment to an unmarried person violated their [[Christian]] religious beliefs.

After she was denied treatment, Benitez argued in court that the physicians and the clinic really based their decision on her being a lesbian. This violated the [[Unruh Civil Rights Act]], a state law prohibiting discrimination based on sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity covering places of business and public accommodation; marital status was not addressed until 2006. She won at the trial court level in [[San Diego]], but that decision was later overturned by a state appeals court. The California State Supreme Court's decision favoring Benitez was unanimous.&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{cite news|last=Egelko|first=Bob|title=Doctors can't use bias to deny gays treatment|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-08-19/bay-area/17124235_1_california-doctors-lesbian-religious-freedom|accessdate=24 January 2011|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=August 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the court, justice Kennard said

&lt;blockquote&gt;California's Unruh Civil Rights Act, from which defendant physicians seek religious exemption, is "a valid and neutral law of general applicability" (Smith, supra, 494 U.S. at p.&amp;nbsp;879). As relevant in this case, it requires business establishments to provide "full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services" to all persons notwithstanding their sexual orientation. (Civ. Code, § 51, subds. (a) &amp; (b).) Accordingly, the First Amendment's right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the Act's antidiscrimination requirements even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with defendants' religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=North Coast Women's Care Medical Group v.

The '''Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act''' (ch. 27, {{USStat|22|403}}) is a [[United States federal law]] enacted in 1883 that mandated that positions within the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] should be awarded on the basis of merit instead of political affiliation.&lt;ref name=penl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&amp;psid=1098|title=Digital History|website=www.digitalhistory.uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act provided selection of government employees by competitive exams,&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation. It also made it illegal to fire or demote government officials for political reasons and prohibited soliciting campaign donations on Federal government property.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; To enforce the merit system and the judicial system, the law also created the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; This board would be in charge of determining the rules and regulations of the act.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; The act also allowed for the president, by executive order, to decide which positions would be subject to the act and which would not.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; A result was the shift of the parties to reliance on funding from business,&lt;ref name=Tragedy&gt;{{cite book|last=Quigley|first=Carroll|title=Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time|year=1966|publisher=Macmillan Co.|location=San Pedro, CA|isbn=094500110X|pages=71|url=https://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-Hope-History-World-Time/dp/094500110X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347944945&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=tragedy+and+hope}}&lt;/ref&gt; since they could no longer depend on patronage.

== History ==
In 1877, there was growing interest in the United States concerning the effects of the [[spoils system]] on the American political system.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; [[New York City]] established the Civil Service Reform Association to help address the issues, which would lead to several other organizations like it appearing in other cities.&lt;ref name=CS2014&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Service 2014|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=0a1a74b1-da5a-4d83-9d8d-68f2d4ebbdca%40sessionmgr110&amp;hid=120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=funk&amp;AN=CI149100|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these organizations was one of the first steps in trying to up end the spoils system in America.

The [[assassination of James A. Garfield|assassination]] of President [[James A. Garfield]] moved the Civil Service Reform from city organizations to a leading topic in the political realm.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt;  President Garfield was shot in July 1881 by [[Charles Guiteau]], because Guiteau believed the president owed him a patronage position for his "vital assistance" in securing [[United States presidential election, 1880|Garfield's election]] the previous year.&lt;ref name=TAP&gt;{{cite web|title=Life and Death in the White House|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/presidency/3d1d.html|website=The American Presidency|publisher=Smithsonian Natural Museum of American History|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield died two months later, and Vice President [[Chester A. Arthur]] acceded to the presidency.&lt;ref name=Study&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilded Age Politics: Political Machines &amp; Civil Service Reform|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/gilded-age-politics-political-machines-civil-service-reform.html|website=Study.Com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in office, President Arthur pushed through legislation for civil reform.&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;

On January 16, 1883 Congress passed the Civil Service Act, which is sometimes referred to as the Pendleton Act after Senator [[George H. Pendleton]] of [[Ohio]],&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; one of the primary sponsors. The Act was written by [[Dorman Bridgman Eaton]], a staunch opponent of the patronage system who was later first chairman of the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].  However, the law would also prove to be a major political liability for Arthur.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt;  The law offended [[Political machine|machine politicians]], or politicians who belong to a small clique that controls a political party.&lt;ref name=TFD&gt;{{cite web|title=Machine Politician|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/machine+politician|website=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These politicians realized that with the Pendleton Act in place they would have to find a new means of income, since they could no longer count on donations from the wealthy hoping to receive jobs.&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;

The Act initially covered only about 10% of the U.S. government's civilian employees.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt;  However, there was a provision that allowed outgoing presidents to lock in their own appointees by converting jobs to civil service. After a series of party reversals at the presidential level (1884, 1888, 1892, 1896), the result was that most federal jobs were under civil service.

The '''Penguin Group''' is a trade book publisher and part of [[Penguin Random House]]. It is owned by [[Pearson PLC]], the global education and publishing company, and [[Bertelsmann]], the German media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]. The new company was created by a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] that was finalised on 1 July 2013, with Bertelsmann owning 53% of the joint venture, and Pearson controlling the remaining 47%.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sweney [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/29/penguin-random-house-book-publisher "Penguin and Random House merger to create biggest book publisher ever seen"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[City of Westminster]]. Retrieved 28 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its British division is ''[[Penguin Books]] Ltd.'' Other separate divisions can be found in the United States, Ireland, New Zealand, India, Australia, Canada, China, Brazil and South Africa.

==History==
[[Penguin Books]] Ltd. (est. 1935) of the United Kingdom was bought over by [[Longman|Pearson Longman]] in 1970. In 1975, Penguin acquired the American hardcover firm [[Viking Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/11/archives/viking-press-is-sold-to-penguin-books.html|title=Viking Press Is Sold to Penguin Books|last=Whitman|first=Alden|date=1975-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Penguin acquired the [[New American Library]], a mass-market paperback publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = McDowell| first = Edwin| title = PENGUIN AGREES TO BUY NEW AMERICAN LIBRARY| accessdate = 2018-12-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/garden/penguin-agrees-to-buy-new-american-library.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penguin Group (USA) Inc. was formed in 1996 as a result of the merger between Penguin Books USA and the [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam Berkley Group]] after Penguin acquired Putnam Berkley from [[MCA Inc.|MCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Lyall| first = Sarah| title = Penguin Is Buying MCA's Putnam Berkley for $336 Million| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-12-02| date = 1996-11-27| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/penguin-is-buying-mca-s-putnam-berkley-for-336-million.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/5618/index1.html|title=Now for the Grann Finale|website=NYMag.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed company was originally called Penguin Putnam Inc., but, in 2003, it changed its name to Penguin Group (USA) Inc. to reflect the parent Pearson PLC's grouping of all the Penguin companies worldwide under the supervisory umbrella of Pearson's own Penguin Group division.

The different Penguin companies use many [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s, many of which used to be independent publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/index.html|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penguin Group (USA) Inc. also operates its own [[speaker's bureau]] that books speaking engagements for many of the publisher's authors. In 2011, the online writing and publishing community [[Book Country]] was launched as a subsidiary of Penguin Group USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcountry.com/AboutUs/Penguin.aspx |title=What's the Penguin About? |publisher=Bookcountry.com |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] filed ''[[United States v. Apple Inc.]]'', naming [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], Penguin, and four other major publishers as defendants.  The suit alleged that they conspired to [[price-fixing|fix prices]] for [[e-books]] and weaken [[Amazon.com]]'s position in the market in violation of [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]].&lt;ref name="washington post DOJ sues"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/justice-department-files-suit-against-apple-publishers-report-says/2012/04/11/gIQAzyXSAT_story.html | title=Justice Department sues Apple, publishers over e-book prices | work=The Washington Post | date=11 April 2012 | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Mui, Ylan Q. and Hayley Tsukayama}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which Penguin and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing.&lt;ref name="usatoday settlements rolling out"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/03/25/amazon-settlements-ebooks/6869033/ | title=E-book price fixing settlements rolling out | work=USA Today | date=25 March 2014 | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Molina, Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate [[Bertelsmann]], over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and [[Random House]]. The houses were considered two of the Big-Six publishing companies, prior to the merger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edgecliffe |first=Andrew |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/eaf8eaaa-1eac-11e2-be82-00144feabdc0.html |title=Penguin and Random House in deal talks |work=Financial Times |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the Big-Five publishing houses upon completion of the combination. The [[European Union]] approved of the [[Penguin Random House]] merger on 5 April 2013; Pearson controls 47% of the publisher.

'''Project Neptune'''  is a water distribution project in the United Kingdom with the goal of establishing an optimized and more sustainable system for water distribution. The project was officially announced in April 2007, and received a budget of £2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www-csd.eng.cam.ac.uk/themes0/water-1/project-neptune-delivering-sustainable-water-systems-by-optimising-existing-infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, water service providers (WSPs) are legally obligated to provide drinking water to all of their customers. The difficulty in optimizing this service involves the minimum water pressure and flow standards, as well as the strict regulations regarding water quality. The innovative technologies required to support the goal of Project Neptune are either partially evolved with no proven reliability or do not exist yet. The Centre for Sustainable Development at the [[University of Cambridge]] is heading the work on integrating [[artificial intelligence]] and mathematical simulation technologies to create an efficient online reporting and analyzing system for monitoring performance of the water distribution system.

== Research priority areas ==
In order to address the technological deficiencies of the project, research priority areas (RPA) have been identified by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The RPA three key concentrations include “data and knowledge management, pressure management (including energy management), and the associated complex decision support systems on which to base interventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savic D. A.|last2=Boxall J. B.|last3=Ulanicki B.|last4=Kapelan Z.|last5=Makropoulos C.|last6=Fenner R.|last7=Soga K.|last8=Marshall I. W.|last9=Maksimovic C.|title=Project Neptune: Improved Operation of Water Distribution Networks|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/41024(340)47|journal=Water Distribution Systems Analysis 2008|series=Proceedings|doi=10.1061/41024(340)47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific objectives of the RPA are focused on developing communication networks, sustainable technologies, real time information feedback system, and optimal operations. The function of the communication network is to evaluate the performance and reliability of already implemented hardware and sensors for collecting faraway data. In order to achieve a reduction in energy usage, sustainable technologies that develop innovative energy harvesting technology and reduce the necessity for constant battery replacement are necessary for the project. Real time information relates to acquiring knowledge related to performance of the water distribution system. Optimal operations can be achieved through improvement in understanding and analyzing relevant data, which includes online models of hydraulics. The first round of RPA work is contributing to the initiative headed by Yorkshire Water Services to install the first prototypes of Ground Penetrating Radar Systems (GPRS). The Yorkshire initiative aims to install around 490 prototypes that are connected to sensors that collect pressure and flow data on a half hourly basis.

== Development goals ==
Project Neptune’s academic and industrial partners aim to address the tasks of developing: energy saving options, online simulation model to provide an overlook of a full day’s water distribution patterns, system to mitigate and manage leakage, automate system adjustments, power harvesting methods, and optimized system for reacting to incidents.

Staff involved in the system controls department of the project have the burden of handling large amounts of data received. The Decision Support System (DSS) was developed in order to alleviate this burden and aid the staff in decision making, prioritizing urgent incidents, and identifying faulty alarms. The DSS functions to combine these strategy and decision making outputs into one single and comprehensive presentation of data for the operator.

== Partners and funding ==
The project today receives funding from the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in order to further advance understanding and contribute knowledge about optimal and efficient water supply systems. Industrial funding is also provided for the project, the main contributors include the United Utilities and Yorkshire Water Services. University of Exeter in the UK carries out research for the project in collaboration with seven other research universities located in the UK, including University of Cambridge, the University of Sheffield, Imperial College London, De Montfort University, Lancaster University, University of Leicester, and University of Sheffield.

'''Section 35''' of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' provides constitutional protection to the [[indigenous rights|indigenous]] and [[treaty rights]] of [[indigenous peoples in Canada]]. The section, while within the [[Constitution of Canada]], falls outside the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. The section does not define the term "aboriginal rights" or provide a closed list; some examples of the rights that section 35 has been found to protect are fishing, logging, hunting, the right to land (cf. [[aboriginal title]]) and the right to enforcement of treaties. There remains a debate over whether the right to [[Indigenous self-government in Canada|indigenous self-government]] is included within section 35. {{As of|2006}} the Supreme Court of Canada has made no ruling on the matter.  However, since 1995 the [[Government of Canada]] has had a policy recognizing the inherent right of self-government under section 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Department of Indian and Northern Affairs|title= The Government of Canada's Approach to Implementation of the Inherent Right and the Negotiation of Aboriginal Self-Government|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/al/ldc/ccl/pubs/sg/sg-eng.asp|accessdate=2009-11-17|quote=The Government of Canada recognizes the [[inherent right]] of self-government as an existing Aboriginal right under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. It recognizes, as well, that the [[inherent right]] may find expression in treaties, and in the context of the Crown's relationship with treaty First Nations. Recognition of the inherent right is based on the view that the Aboriginal peoples of Canada have the right to govern themselves in relation to matters that are internal to their communities, integral to their unique cultures, identities, traditions, languages and institutions, and with respect to their special relationship to their land and their resources.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The provision provides that:&lt;ref name="defe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html |title=RIGHTS OF THE ABORIGINAL PEOPLES OF CANADA|work=Department of Justice Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|35. (1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.

(2) In this Act, "aboriginal peoples of Canada" includes the Indian, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada.

(3) For greater certainty, in subsection (1) "treaty rights" includes rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.

(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the aboriginal and treaty rights referred to in subsection (1) are guaranteed equally to male and female persons.}}

==Aboriginal rights==
In 1982, when section 35 was entrenched into the Canadian Constitution, Delbert Riley the National Leader of the National Indian Brotherhood or later known as the "AFN" or "Assembly of First Nations", was quoted as saying "Aboriginal Rights are what First Nations define them as. Their rights are what they were before European contact, and remain the same after European contact".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 

Aboriginal rights refer to the activities, practice, and traditions of the Aboriginal peoples in Canada that are integral to the distinctive culture of Aboriginal peoples.

The word "existing" in section 35(1) has created the need for the Supreme Court to define what Aboriginal rights "exist". The Supreme Court ruled in ''[[R. v. Sparrow]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=R. v. Sparrow|link=R. v. Sparrow|year=1990|court=scc|num=104|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1990] 1 SCR 1075|date=1990-05-31|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, before 1982 (when section 35 came into effect), Aboriginal rights existed by virtue of the [[common law]]. Common law could be changed by legislation. Therefore, before 1982, the federal Parliament could extinguish Aboriginal rights, whereas now it can no longer extinguish any rights that still existed in 1982.  [[Extinguishment]] of rights can only occur through an act that showed "clear and plain intention" on the government to deny those rights.

In ''Sparrow'', the Court also held the words "recognized and affirmed" incorporate the government's [[fiduciary]] duty to the Aboriginal peoples which requires them to exercise restraint when applying their powers in interference with Aboriginal rights. This further suggests that Aboriginal rights are not absolute and can be encroached upon given sufficient reason.  After the ''Sparrow'' case, provincial legislation can only limit Aboriginal rights if it has given them appropriate priority.

However, in the ''Sparrow'' case, the court did not have to address what was in fact an Aboriginal right for the purposes of s.35(1) since neither side disputed that the [[Musqueam]] had an Aboriginal right to fish for food. This was developed in ''[[R. v. Van der Peet]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=R. v. Van der Peet|link=R. v. Van der Peet|year=1996|court=scc|num=216|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1996] 2 SCR 507|date=1996-08-21|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Chief Justice Lamer's majority decided that to be considered an Aboriginal right, a practice must have been integral to the distinctive nature of the culture prior to contact by Europeans.

==Honour of the Crown==

As part of the historical relationship between them, any time the government is interacting with Aboriginal people the honour of the crown is said to be at stake. This principle of the "honour of the crown" imposes a number of duties upon the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AILR/1996/44.html |title=The Government of Canada's Approach to Implementation of the Inherent Right and the Negotiation of Aboriginal Self-Government|work=the Honourable Ronald A. Irwin, P.C., M.P.|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2009-11-17|quote=The Crown has a unique, historic, fiduciary relationship with Aboriginal peoples in Canada. The fact that the federal government recognizes an inherent right of self-government does not imply the end of this historic relationship. But it is important to understand the ways in which the exercise of Aboriginal self-government may change the nature of this relationship. As Aboriginal governments assume greater control over decision-making that affects their communities, they will also assume greater responsibilities for those decisions. This will mean that the role and responsibilities of the Crown will lessen. In this sense, the historic relationship between Aboriginal peoples and the Crown will not disappear, but will evolve as a natural consequence of Aboriginal peoples' changing role in shaping their own lives and communities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flowing from the honour principle is a duty on the Crown to consult with Aboriginals in any industry activities. This duty was first described in the decisions of ''[[Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests)]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests)|link=Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests)|year=2004|court=scc|num=73|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2004] 3 SCR 511|date=2004-11-18|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Taku River Tlingit First Nation v. British Columbia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Taku River Tlingit First Nation v. British Columbia (Project Assessment Director)|link=|year=2004|court=scc|num=74|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2004] 3 SCR 550|date=2004-11-18|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duty is engaged when "the Province has knowledge, real or constructive, of the potential existence of Aboriginal right or title and contemplates conduct that might adversely affect them."&lt;ref&gt;''Haida'', at para. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The determination of such a duty depends both on the strength of the right that is being encroached upon as well as the negative impact and gravity of the government's conduct.

==Not a Charter right==

The section in the ''Charter'' that most directly relates to Aboriginal people is [[Section Twenty-five of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 25]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atns.net.au/agreement.asp?EntityID=1091|title=Inherent Right of Self-Government Policy |year=1995 |publisher=Indigenous Studies Program, The University of Melbourne|accessdate=2009-11-17|quote=The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms forms a part of the Canadian Constitution and sets out the rights and freedoms believed necessary to a free and democratic Canadian society. It came into effect on 17 April 1982 as a part of the package of reforms contained in the Constitution Act, 1982. The Charter covers subjects including: Freedom of expression; Democratic government; Right to live and seek employment anywhere in Canada; Legal rights of persons accused of criminal offences; Rights of Aboriginal Peoples; Rights to equality, including that between women and men; Protection of cultural heritage; and Right to use either of Canada’s official languages.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It merely states that ''Charter'' rights do not diminish Aboriginal rights; it is therefore not as important as section 35.&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Charter'' forms Part I of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' while section 35 is placed in Part II.  This placement in the Constitution is considered significant.  Professor Kent McNeil has written it could be seen as meaning section 35 allows for Aboriginal self-government, while the ''Charter'' is concerned with more [[individual rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Kent McNeil, "Aboriginal Governments and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms," (Canada, Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 1996), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor [[Peter Hogg]] has argued there are negative and positive effects of excluding section 35 from the ''Charter''. Section 35 cannot be limited by [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] or the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]. However, [[Section Twenty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 24]] of the ''Charter'', which allows remedies for rights violations, is not available to section 35. Moreover, in ''R. v. Sparrow'' the Court developed a test to limit section 35 that Hogg has compared to the section 1 [[Oakes test]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, 621.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, professors [[Ted Morton]] and [[Rainer Knopff]], in their criticisms of ''Charter'' case law and growing judicial discretion, treat section 35 as if it were part of the ''Charter''.  They write that "Section 35 is technically 'outside' of the Charter, but as a declaration of the special rights of Canada's most salient racial minority- rights that are enforceable in the courts- it has become an important part of the Charter revolution."&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Morton and Rainer Knopff, ''The Charter Revolution &amp; the Court Party'' (Toronto: Broadview Press, 2000), page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6633">A '''servitude''' is a qualified beneficial [[interest]] severed or fragmented from the [[ownership]] of an inferior [[property]] (''servient [[estate in land|estate]]'') and attached to a superior property (''dominant estate'') ''or'' to some [[person]] (''personal beneficiary'') other than the [[ownership|owner]].&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Elliott, ''The South African Notary'', 6th edn. (Cape Town: Juta, 1987), 168.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], ownership (''dominium'') (e.g. of land) is the only full [[ius in re|real right]] whereas a servitude is a [[encumbrance|subordinate real right]] on par with [[English_land_law#Easements_and_Wayleaves|wayleaves]], real burdens (i.e. [[real covenant]]s), [[security interest]]s, and reservations. There are two types:&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Yiannopoulos, Predial Servitudes, sections 3-12 (3d ed. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; ''predial'', attaching to property, and ''personal'', attaching to a person.

A servitude cannot impose the performance of a positive duty on the owner of the burdened property but only duties either to refrain from exercising certain rights to which an owner could be otherwise entitled (''negative servitude'') or to suffer certain things to be done to his property which an owner otherwise could be entitled to forbid or resist (''positive servitude''). Servitudes arise from express [[Contract|agreement]], [[adverse possession]], or as a matter of law.

==Predial servitude==
A predial (Brit. ''praedial'') servitude is an [[incorporeal]] [[hereditament]] burdening a servient estate (''praedium serviens'') for the benefit of a dominant estate (''praedium dominans'') to protect the holder in his own rights to the use or enjoyment of property. The two estates must belong to different bare title holders (''dominus nudea proprietatis'', i.e. [[fee simple]] owners). This type of servitude may only burden immovable property (i.e. [[real property]]). The right is for the benefit of the dominant estate rather than the person&lt;ref&gt;La. Civ. Code Ann. Art. 646 (West 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and remains in effect upon its transfer, that is, it runs with the land and extends to any owner, whether the original or successor-in-title. Predial servitudes are limited to:
* [[nonpossessory interest in land|nonpossessory interests]]: [[easement]]s appurtenant, whether public or private.

Predial servitudes are generally characterized as: 
* permanent - the interest is effective for as long as ownership continues, that is, in perpetuity or for a fixed term of years;
* accessory - servitudes are inseparable from the dominant estate and run with it, and the property interest cannot be conveyed, leased, or encumbered separately from the dominant estate; and
* indivisible - the servitude burdens the whole servient estate and benefits the whole dominant estate; the servitude runs in benefit of each subdivided estate resulting from the partition of the dominant estate, and this does not result in an additional burden for each subdivision on the servient estate.

When a servient estate exists but the servient owner cannot be determined, and where the law allows, a dominant owner may be granted a servitude right ''a non domino'', i.e. absent the servient owner. In this event, the dominant owner will generally not be indemnified by the land registry for the statutory prescriptive period.
===Benefitting enclaves===
{{main|Enclaves and exclaves}}
Originally, [[enclave]] was a term of property law, across much of Europe, particularly seen early in 15th century France derived from earlier ecclesiastical senses, for the situation of a main estate of land or a parcel of land surrounded by land owned by a different owner(s), and that could not be reached for its exploitation in a practical and sufficient manner without crossing the surrounding land.&lt;ref name="LGR"&gt;Le Grand Robert, ''Dictionnaire de la Langue Française'', 2001, vol.&amp;nbsp;III, p.&amp;nbsp;946.&lt;/ref&gt;  In law, this created a ''servitude''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |quote=Servitude: '''Law'''. ''A right possessed by one person with respect to another's property, consisting either of a right to use the other's property, or a power to prevent certain uses of it''. |title=Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language |year=1989  |page=1304}}&lt;/ref&gt; of passage for the benefit of the owner of the surrounded land.

==Personal servitude==
A personal servitude is an interest that benefits its holder personally or financially with or without the use or enjoyment of property. In this case, there is no dominant estate, only a personal beneficiary, and therefore the servitude is in principle not assignable or inheritable, unless transferability is part of the original grant or results from economic purposes that the servitude is designed to serve. Instead, the servitude moves with a particular person, not with a specific property, and includes:
* easements in gross;
* [[life interest]]s: rights of use (''usus''), residence (''habitatio''), and [[usufruct]];
* limited interests: rights of pre-emption, emption, and redemption.

[[Code Napoleon|Napoleonic]] civil-law countries do not generally recognize personal servitudes. The mixed jurisdictions of [[Quebec]] and [[Louisiana]] are exceptions due to influence from [[common law]], but under these systems personal servitudes are limited to easements in gross.

==Quebec==
Under [[Quebec]] law, a servitude is a [[ius in re|real right]] excluding [[wikt:third party|third parties]] and which is created ''[[sui generis]]'', by agreement (''ex contractu''), or by operation of law (''ex lege''). [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec Civil Code]], article 1177 provides:
:''A servitude is a charge imposed on an immovable, the servient land, in favour of another immovable, the dominant land, belonging to a different owner. [...]''

Quebec law distinguishes between predial and personal servitudes.
* A predial servitude is a perpetual real right in the property of another (the ''servient estate'') which confers on the owner of the dominant estate permanent, specific entitlements of use and enjoyment (''beneficial interest'') of the servient estate.
* A personal servitude is a limited real right granting the holder specific entitlements of use and enjoyment of an item of movable (personal) or immovable (real) property of another in his personal capacity for a specific period or his lifetime or, in the case of a [[legal person]], for a maximum of 100 years.

On November 26, 2012, Chief District Judge [[Robert Clive Jones|Robert Jones]] ruled against the plaintiff same-sex couples, granting in part a [[motion (legal)|motion to dismiss]] the complaint against the Nevada government officials named in it. The plaintiffs appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] on December 3, 2012.

A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments in ''Sevcik'' and two related cases, ''[[Jackson v. Abercrombie]]'' and ''[[Latta v. Otter]]'', on September 8, 2014. On October 7, the panel reversed the lower court's ruling in ''Sevcik'', remanding the case back to district court with direction to enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. This effectively legalized same-sex marriage in Nevada. After at least one judge on the Court of Appeals asked for a vote on the defendants' petition to have the case reheard by a larger, 11-judge panel, a majority of judges on the Ninth Circuit did not agree; thus making the ruling final on January 9, 2015.

==Constitutional amendment==
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Nevada}}
The [[Constitution of Nevada]] was amended in 2002 to incorporate Article 1, Section 21, which reads: "Only a marriage between a male and female person shall be recognized and given effect in this state," restricting marriage to different-sex couples. Voters first approved a ballot question endorsing this amendment to that effect on November 7, 2000, with 70% of the vote.&lt;ref name=proposal&gt;{{cite news|title=Marriage proposal heading to Legislature|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2002/nov/06/marriage-proposal-heading-to-legislature/|accessdate=December 3, 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=November 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal sponsor was the Coalition to Protect Marriage, a local organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drive targets same-sex marriages|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2000/jan/04/drive-targets-same-sex-marriages/|accessdate=December 3, 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=January 4, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Nevada requires a constitutional amendment be approved by the voters twice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willis|first=Stacey J.|title=Question 2 opponents appeal to young voters|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2000/oct/19/question-2-opponents-appeal-to-young-voters/|accessdate=December 3, 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=October 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevada voters considered the same [[Nevada Question 2 (2002)|ballot question]] on November 5, 2002, and approved it by a margin of 67%–33%.&lt;ref name=proposal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Petition filed to ban gay marriages|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2000/jan/04/petition-filed-to-ban-gay-marriages/|accessdate=December 4, 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=January 4, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
On April 10, 2012, [[Lambda Legal]], an [[LGBT]] rights advocacy organization, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada on behalf of eight same-sex couples. Four of the couples had been denied marriage licenses by county clerks in Nevada. The other four had married in other jurisdictions (California and Canada) and wanted Nevada to recognize their relationships as marriages. The suit named as defendants Gov. [[Brian Sandoval]] and three county clerks. Lambda Attorney Tara Borelli explained the plaintiffs' argument: "[W]e are relying on the Nevada domestic partnership law to help illustrate how irrational the unequal treatment of same-sex couples is, because there are a number of rationales they have articulated for this kind of discrimination that really are not credible in Nevada. For example, it is often argued in these cases that there is an interest relating to children and parenting. But in Nevada, separate and apart from the constitutional amendment, the state treats same-sex couple equally as parents in other respects. And so that can't be what the marriage amendment is about, because it has no effect on parenting."&lt;ref name=conversation&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomaston|first=Scottie|title=Sevcik v. Sandoval: A conversation with Tara Borelli, staff attorney at Lambda Legal and lead counsel on Nevada's marriage equality case|url=http://www.prop8trialtracker.com/2012/08/13/sevcik-v-sandoval-a-conversation-with-tara-borelli-staff-attorney-at-lambda-legal-and-lead-counsel-on-nevadas-marriage-equality-case/ |accessdate=December 3, 2012 |newspaper=Prop8TrialTracker|date=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs argued that Nevada's contrast of marriage and domestic partnership, which it called a "second-class status", distinguished their case from Minnesota's lack of any provision for same-sex couples in 1972, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'' refused to hear a challenge to Minnesota's restrictive marriage definition "for want of a substantial federal question."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/105609502/2-12-cv-00578-86 Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, September 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of their equal protection claim, the plaintiffs argued that the court should evaluate distinctions based on sexual orientation using the [[heightened scrutiny]] standard. They did not assert a fundamental right to marry nor a due process claim, but focused on the equal protection claim and Nevada's disparate treatment of same-sex couples, being "so convinced that our equal protection claim is correct that we wanted to keep the focus of the case there.... And courts often like to decide questions no more broadly than they need to, to resolve a case.&lt;ref name=conversation/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner|first=Chris|title=Lambda Legal Files Federal Lawsuit Seeking Marriage Equality in Nevada|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2012/04/lambda-legal-files-federal-lawsuit-seeking-marriag.html|accessdate=December 4, 2012|newspaper=Metro Weekly|date=April 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022103151/http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2012/04/lambda-legal-files-federal-lawsuit-seeking-marriag.html|archivedate=October 22, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Nevada reporter noted that both Republican Gov. Sandoval, the principal defendant in the suit, and Democratic Attorney General [[Catherine Cortez Masto]], who was representing him, tended to avoid public controversy and "both ... refused to fully engage in the political debate. They're framing their roles as technocrats doing an administrative job rather than politicians or ideologues wading into an emotional issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=David McGrath|title=Governor, attorney general stick to book on gay marriage|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/may/27/governor-attorney-general-stick-book-gay-marriage/ |accessdate=December 3, 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Robert Clive Jones|Robert Jones]], Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court of Nevada, held an initial hearing on August 10, 2012. The parties had agreed in advance on how they wanted the court to handle motions in the case. The plaintiffs agreed not to oppose the request by the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, the original backers of the constitutional amendment and now based in Boise, Idaho, to intervene as a defendant. The defendants agreed that the court should postpone consideration of its arguments for summary dismissal&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93951551/2-12-cv-00578-32]&lt;/ref&gt; until the case was fully briefed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomaston|first=Scottie|title=Federal judge agrees to hear Nevada marriage equality lawsuit|url=http://www.prop8trialtracker.com/2012/08/10/breaking-federal-judge-agrees-to-hear-nevada-marriage-equality-lawsuit/ |accessdate=December 3, 2012 |newspaper=Prop8TrialTracker|date=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides asked the court to allow them to present expert testimony. Jones did not rule out expert testimony but expressed strong reservations, that it would require him to act "as a legislature". He said: "This area you're talking about ... is so broad it's across the entire United States. You're asking them to summarize thousands of incidences." Noting that several related cases were nearing possible consideration by the Supreme Court, he agreed the case should be expedited: "It makes sense to get this decided and off with the circus train." He thought ''Sevcik'' would make a good complement to the Ninth Circuit's decision in ''[[Perry v. Brown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Combs|first=Jacob |title=An analysis of the initial hearing in the Nevada marriage equality case Sevcik v. Sandoval|url=http://www.prop8trialtracker.com/2012/08/24/an-analysis-of-the-initial-hearing-in-the-nevada-marriage-equality-case-sevcik-v-sandoval/|accessdate=December 3, 2012|newspaper=Prop8TrialTracker|date=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones scheduled oral argument for November 26 on all issues in the case, but on September 19 he canceled the oral argument and announced he would rule on the basis of the briefs alone.

==District court decision==
On November 29, Jones ruled against the plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner|first=Chris|title=Federal Judge Rules Nevada Can Ban Same-Sex Couples From Marriage|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-judge-rules-the-nevada-can-ban-same-sex-co|accessdate=November 30, 2012|newspaper=BuzzFeed Politics|date=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that "the present challenge is in the main a garden-variety equal protection challenge precluded by ''Baker''.... The equal protection claim is the same in this case as it was in ''Baker'', i.e., whether the Equal Protection Clause prevents a state from refusing to permit same-sex marriages."

Jones also analyzed the plaintiffs' other arguments "so that the Court of Appeals need not remand for further proceedings should it rule that ''Baker'' does not control..." He identified the discrimination Nevada makes between marriages the state does and does not recognize as a distinction based not on gender, which would require him to use [[intermediate scrutiny]], but on sexual orientation, stating that the state maintains "heterosexual superiority ... by relegating (mainly) homosexual legal unions to a lesser status".

He found that only the [[rational basis]] standard applies to distinctions based on sexual orientation, relying on ''[[High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office]]'' (1990). He explained his agreement with that case's determination that "homosexuals are not a suspect or quasi-suspect class" requiring a higher standard of review because "where no lingering effects of past discrimination are inherited, it is contemporary disadvantages that matter for the purpose of assessing disabilities due to discrimination. Any such disabilities with respect to homosexuals have been largely erased since 1990." He also argued that homosexuals have gained significant political power, citing the rarity of anti-homosexual messages in the national media and attributing the president's acceptance of same-sex marriage to "the homosexual-rights lobby". He disputed the Second Circuit's finding in ''[[Windsor v. United States]]'' (2012) that homosexuals are a politically powerless class: "The question of 'powerlessness' under an equal protection analysis requires that the group's chances of democratic success be virtually hopeless, not simply that its path to success is difficult or challenging because of democratic forces." He states that no action should be taken on unclear Constitutional rules, such as "equal protection of the laws", which is a vague clause of the Constitution whose enforcement is "a usurpation of democratic governance via judicial whim—a judicial practice much in vogue today". Having determined that there is no clear Constitutional prohibition, he cited a [[concurring opinion]] in ''Frontiero v. Richardson'' that the Supreme Court should not decide sensitive issues at the very time they are under consideration.

Finally, applying rational basis review, Jones found that "[t]he protection of the traditional institution of marriage ... is a legitimate state interest" and quoted ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', stating that the prevention of "abuse of an institution the law protects" is a valid state interest. He found that the state may rely on speculation alone for its rational basis, citing ''Heller v. Doe''. If marriage is extended to same-sex couples, he wrote, "it is conceivable that a meaningful percentage of heterosexual persons would cease to value the civil institution as highly as they previously had ... leading to an increased percentage of out-of-wedlock children, single-parent families, ... or other unforeseen consequences." He stated that Nevada has not decreased same-sex couples' rights (having no right to marry to begin with) and that their exclusion from marriage but not from a separate-but-parallel institution can only be seen as "benevolence".

He also addressed issues not raised by the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs had referenced ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'' (1996) only to note that the Supreme Court in that case had found it unnecessary to consider more than rational basis review.&lt;ref group=n&gt;"Although the Supreme Court has not yet ruled that sexual orientation classifications are suspect, that is because the Supreme Court has not yet found it necessary to resolve the question. ''Romer v. Evans'' ... did not decide the issue, finding it unnecessary to look beyond rational basis review both because the state's attempt to strip gay people of all antidiscrimination protections was a 'denial of equal protection of the laws in the most literal sense,' and because the state's action 'confound[ed]' and 'defie[d]' rational basis review." [https://www.scribd.com/doc/105609502/2-12-cv-00578-86 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgement, September 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Jones discussed ''Romer'' at length to show how it did not apply to Nevada's marriage restriction, since ''Romer'' addressed, he wrote, "an extreme case concerning a novel and ambitious type of law ... prevalent only under totalitarian regimes." Nevada's definition of marriage by contrast was "not based purely upon anti-homosexual animus, as the constitutional provision in ''Romer'' was."

==Appeal==
Attorneys for the plaintiffs filed an appeal on December 3, 2012 with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/115480472/2-12-cv-00578-104 Sevcik v. Sandoval, Plaintiffs' Notice of Appeal, December 3, 2012], accessed December 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Court originally planned to hear the case on a parallel track with a similar Hawaii same-sex marriage case, ''[[Jackson v.

The Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on September 8 before Judges [[Stephen Reinhardt]], [[Ronald M. Gould]], and [[Marsha S. Berzon]] in ''Sevcik'', ''Jackson'', and a third case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geidner|first1=Chris|title=Appeals Court Appears Ready To Strike Down Idaho, Nevada Same-Sex Marriage Bans|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/appeals-court-appears-ready-to-strike-down-idaho-nevada-same#3h452jn|accessdate=September 18, 2014|work=BuzzFeed News|date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It overturned the district court's ruling on October 7, finding Nevada's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snow|first1=Jutsin|title=Federal appeals court finds Idaho, Nevada same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/2014/10/federal-appeals-court-finds-idaho-nevada-same-sex-marriage-bans-unconstitutional/|accessdate=October 7, 2014|work=MetroWeekly|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the federal district court in Nevada and remanded it back to the district court, ordering it to immediately issue an injunction to bar enforcement of the Nevada same-sex marriage ban amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ninth Circuit Opinion|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2014/10/07/12-17668%20opinion.pdf|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It immediately made its holdings final and issued its mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ninth Circuit Mandate|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2014/10/07/14-35420%20mandate.pdf |date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 8, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, apparently by mistake, ordered the Ninth Circuit's mandate temporarily stayed as part of his response to a request from Idaho officials in a related case.

On remand, the plaintiffs submitted a motion asking the district court for an injunction preventing the state from enforcing its same-sex marriage ban and providing the court with its suggested language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plaintiffs' Proposed Order Granting Permanent Injunctive Relief, October 7, 2014|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/242251794/2-12-cv-00578-116|website=Scribd.com |publisher=US.

==Petition for rehearing==
The Coalition to Protect Marriage asked the Ninth Circuit to rehear the case ''[[en banc]]''. Among other arguments, it presented a statistical analysis that called into question the randomness of the Circuit's method of assigning judges to cases. Attorneys for the same-sex couples, while contending that the method of judge selection could not be grounds for rehearing the case, disputed the Coalition's statistical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plaintiffs' Response to Intervenor's Petition for Rehearing En Banc|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/246428243/12-17668-286|publisher=Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals |accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After at least one circuit judge called for a vote on the petition for rehearing ''Sevcik'' (along with ''[[Latta v.

'''Singapore International Arbitration Centre''' (SIAC) is a not-for-profit [[arbitration]] organisation based in Singapore, which administers arbitrations under its own rules of arbitration and the [[UNCITRAL]] Arbitration Rules. It was established in 1991 and is located at [[Maxwell Chambers]], formerly the Customs House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawgazette.com.sg/2001-8/Aug01-focus3.htm|title=Why Arbitration? Why Singapore?|publisher=Law Gazette, Singapore|date=Aug 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
SIAC arbitration awards have been enforced in many jurisdictions including Australia, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Thailand, UK, USA and Vietnam, amongst other New York Convention signatories. SIAC is a global arbitral institution providing case management services to parties from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siac.org.sg/2014-11-03-13-33-43/about-us|title=About SIAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also see [http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/08/define-term-international-law.html Definition of international law]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Sources of international law''' include [[treaties]], [[customary international law|international customs]], general principles of law as recognized by civilized nations, the decisions of national and lower courts, and scholarly writings.  They are the materials and processes out of which the rules and principles regulating the [[international community]] are developed. They have been influenced by a range of political and [[legal theory|legal theories]].

== The Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ==
The sources of international law can be found in Article 38.1 of the Statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/?p1=4&amp;p2=2#CHAPTER_II|title=Statute of the Court|publisher=International Court of Justice, United Nations|accessdate=18 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213184603/http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/?p1=4&amp;p2=2#CHAPTER_II|archivedate=13 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This portfolio of sources was extracted from Article 38 of the original world court's constitutive statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Perspectives on International Law|last=Solmanson|first=William|publisher=WADSWORTH CENGAGE Learning|year=2011|isbn=978-0-495-79723-4|location=Boston|pages=27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 38 (1) of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]] is generally recognized as a definitive statement of the sources of international law. It requires the Court to apply, among other things, (a) international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states; (b) international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law; (c) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations; (d) subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.[http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/index.php?p1=4&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=0]

== Historic considerations and development ==
During the 19th century, it was recognized by [[legal positivism|legal positivists]] that a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] could limit its authority to act by consenting to an [[Treaty|agreement]] according to the principle ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]''. This consensual view of international law was reflected in the 1920 Statute of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], and was later preserved in Article 38(1) of the 1946 Statute of the [[International Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/index.php?p1=4&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=0 Statute of the International Court of Justice].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hierarchy ==
On the question of preference between sources of international law, rules established by [[treaty]] will take preference if such an instrument exists. It is also argued however that international treaties and international custom are sources of international law of equal validity; this is that new custom may supersede older treaties and new treaties may override older custom. Also, [[Peremptory norm|''jus cogens'' (peremptory norm)]] is a custom, not a treaty. Certainly, judicial decisions and juristic writings are regarded as auxiliary sources of international law, whereas it is unclear whether the general principles of law recognized by 'civilized nations' should be recognized as a principal or auxiliary source of international law. Nevertheless, treaty, custom, and general principles of law are generally recognized as primary sources of international law.

== Treaties as law ==
{{Main article|Treaties}}

Treaties and conventions are the persuasive source of international law and are considered "hard law." Treaties can play the role of [[contract]]s between two or more parties, such as an [[extradition]] treaty or a defense pact. Treaties can also be [[legislation]] to regulate a particular aspect of international relations or form the constitutions of international organizations. Whether or not all treaties can be regarded as sources of law, they are sources of obligation for the parties to them. Article 38(1)(a) of the ICJ, which uses the term "international conventions", concentrates upon treaties as a source of contractual obligation but also acknowledges the possibility of a state expressly accepting the obligations of a treaty to which it is not formally a party.

For a treaty-based rule to be a source of law, rather than simply a source of obligation, it must either be capable of affecting non-parties or have consequences for parties more extensive than those specifically imposed by the treaty itself.

Thus, the procedures or methods by treaties become legally binding are formal source of law which is a process by a legal rule comes into existence: it is law creating.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Dixon, ''Textbook on International Law'' (Oxford University Press, 7th ed 2013) 24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treaties as custom ===
Some treaties are the result of codifying existing customary law, such as laws governing the global commons, and ''[[jus ad bellum]]''. While the purpose is to establish a code of general application, its effectiveness depends upon the number of states that ratify or accede to the particular convention. Relatively few such instruments have a sufficient number of parties to be regarded as international law in their own right. The most obvious example is the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions for the Protection of War Victims]].

Most multi-lateral treaties fall short of achieving such a near universal degree of formal acceptance and are dependent upon their provisions being regarded as representing customary international law and, by this indirect route, as binding upon non-parties. This outcome is possible in a number of ways:

* When the treaty rule reproduces an existing rule of customary law, the rule will be clarified in terms of the treaty provision. A notable example is the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] 1969, which was considered by the ICJ to be law even before it had been brought into force.&lt;ref&gt;''Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South-West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276'' (1970) (Advisory Opinion) [1971] ICJ Reports 16 at 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
* When a customary rule is in the process of development, its incorporation in a multilateral treaty may have the effect of consolidating or crystallizing the law in the form of that rule. It is not always easy to identify when this occurs. Where the practice is less developed, the treaty provision may not be enough to crystallize the rule as part of customary international law.&lt;ref&gt;''North Sea Continental Shelf'' cases, note 6 at 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even if the rule is new, the drafting of the treaty provision may be the impetus for its adoption in the practice of states, and it is the subsequent acceptance of the rule by states that renders it effective as part of customary law.&lt;ref&gt;''North Sea Continental Shelf'' cases, note 6 at 41. See also ''Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal'', Vol. 1, Judgment, 171 at 253–4.&lt;/ref&gt; If a broad definition is adopted of state practice, the making of a treaty would fall within the definition. Alternatively, it is possible to regard the treaty as the final act of state practice required to establish the rule in question, or as the necessary articulation of the rule to give it the ''opinion juries'' of customary international law.
* Convention-based "instant custom" has been identified by the ICJ on several occasions as representing customary law without explanation of whether the provision in question was supported by state practice. This has happened with respect to a number of provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969. If "instant custom" is valid as law, it could deny to third parties the normal consequences of non-accession to the

=== The United Nations Charter ===
Pursuant to [[Chapter XVI of the United Nations Charter#Article 103|Chapter XVI, Article 103]] of the [[United Nations Charter]], the obligations under the United Nations Charter overrides the terms of any other [[treaty]]. Meanwhile, its [[Preamble to the United Nations Charter|Preamble]] affirms establishment of the obligations out of treaties and source of international law.

== International custom ==
{{Main article|Customary international law}}

Article 38(1)(b) of the ICJ Statute refers to "international custom" as a source of international law, specifically emphasizing the two requirements of state practice plus acceptance of the practice as obligatory or ''[[opinio juries save necessitatis]]'' (usually abbreviated as ''opinion juries'').

Derived from the consistent practice of (originally) Western states accompanied by opinion juries (the conviction of States that the consistent practice is required by a legal obligation), [[customary international law]] is differentiated from acts of [[comity]] (mutual recognition of government acts) by the presence of ''opinion juries'' (although in some instances, acts of comity have developed into customary international law, i.e. [[diplomatic immunity]]). Treaties have gradually displaced much customary international law. This development is similar to the replacement of customary or common law by codified law in municipal legal settings, but customary international law continues to play a significant role in international law.

=== State practice ===
When examining state practice to determine relevant rules of international law, it is necessary to take into account every activity of the organs and officials of states that relate to that purpose. There has been continuing debate over where a distinction should be drawn as to the weight that should be attributed to what states do, rather than what they say represents the law. In its most extreme form, this would involve rejecting what states say as practice and relegating it to the status of evidence of ''opinion juries''.&lt;ref&gt;D'Amato, A., ''The Concept of Custom in International Law'' (Cornell University Press: Ithaca, New York, 1971) at 88.&lt;/ref&gt; A more moderate version would evaluate what a state says by reference to the occasion on which the statement was made.&lt;ref&gt;Thirlway, H., ''International Customary Law and its Codification'' (A. W. Sijthoff: Leiden, 1972) at 58.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only relatively powerful countries with extensive international contacts and interests that have regular opportunities of contributing by deed to the practice of international law. The principal means of contribution to state practice for the majority of states will be at meetings of international organizations, particularly the [[UN General Assembly]], by voting and otherwise expressing their view on matters under consideration. Moreover, there are circumstances in which what states say may be the only evidence of their view as to what conduct is required in a particular situation.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States of America) (Merits)'' [1986] ICJ Reports 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of practice establishing a customary rule implies that the practice is followed regularly, or that such state practice must be "common, consistent and concordant".&lt;ref&gt;''Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (United Kingdom v Iceland) (Merits)'' [1974] ICJ Reports 3 at 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the size of the international community, the practice does not have to encompass all states or be completely uniform. There has to be a sufficient degree of participation, especially on the part of states whose interests are likely to be most affected,&lt;ref&gt;''North Sea Continental Shelf Cases (Federal Republic of Germany v Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany v Netherlands'') [1969] ICJ Reports 4 at 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and an absence of substantial dissent.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicaragua'' case (Merits), note 4 at 98.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of occasions on which the ICJ has rejected claims that a customary rule existed because of a lack of consistency in the practice brought to its attention.&lt;ref&gt;''Asylum Case (Colombia v Peru)'' [1950] ICJ Rep 266 at 277; ''Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict'' [1996] ICJ Reports 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of a specific dispute, however, it is not necessary to establish the generality of practice. A rule may apply if a state has accepted the rule as applicable to it individually, or because the two states belong to a group of states between which the rule applies.&lt;ref&gt;''Case Concerning Right of Passage over Indian Territory (Portugal v India) (Merits)'' [1960] ICJ Reports 6 at 39; ''Asylum'' case, note 8 at 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

A dissenting state is entitled to deny the opposability of a rule in question if it can demonstrate its [[persistent objector|persistent objection]] to that rule,&lt;ref&gt;''North Sea Continental Shelf'' cases, note 6 at 229, 232 per Judge Lachs.&lt;/ref&gt; either as a member of a regional group&lt;ref&gt;''Asylum'' case, note 8 at 277–8.&lt;/ref&gt; or by virtue of its membership of the international community.&lt;ref&gt;''Fisheries Case (United Kingdom v Norway) (Judgment)'' [1951] ICJ Reports 116, at 131.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not easy for a single state to maintain its dissent. Also, rules of the ''jus cogens'' have a universal character and apply to all states, irrespective of their wishes.&lt;ref&gt;See ''North Sea Continental Shelf'' cases, note 6 at 229 per Judge Lachs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand for rules that are responsive to increasingly rapid changes has led to the suggestion that there can be, in appropriate circumstances, such a concept as "instant custom". Even within traditional doctrine, the ICJ has recognized that passage of a short period of time is not necessarily a bar to the formation of a new rule.&lt;ref&gt;''North Sea Continental Shelf'' cases, note 6 at 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the question is sometimes raised as to whether the word "custom" is suitable to a process that could occur with great rapidity.

=== Practice by international organizations ===
It may be argued that the practice of international organizations, most notably that of the [[United Nations]], as it appears in the resolutions of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], are an additional source of international law, even though it is not mentioned as such in Article 38(1) of the 1946 Statute of the [[International Court of Justice]]. Article 38(1) is closely based on the corresponding provision of the 1920 Statute of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], thus predating the role that international organizations have come to play in the international plane. That is, the provision of Article 38(1) may be regarded as 'dated'', and this can most vividly be seen in the mention made of 'civilized nations', a mentioning that appears all the more quaint after the decolonization process that took place in the early 1960s and the participation of nearly all nations of the world in the [[United Nations]].

=== ''Opinio juris'' ===

A wealth of state practice does not usually carry with it a presumption that ''[[opinio juries give necessitatis|opinio juris]]'' exists. “Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it.”&lt;ref&gt;See ''North Sea Continental Shelf'' cases, note 6 at 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where practice (of which evidence is given) comprises abstentions from acting, consistency of conduct might not establish the existence of a rule of customary international law. The fact that no [[nuclear weapons]] have been used since 1945, for example, does not render their use illegal on the basis of a customary obligation because the necessary ''opinion juries'' was lacking.&lt;ref&gt;''Legality of Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion (GA)'', note 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ICJ has frequently referred to ''opinion juries'' as being an equal footing with state practice,&lt;ref&gt;''Case Concerning the Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v Malta) (Judgment)'' [1985] ICJ Reports 13 at 29; ''Legality of Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion (GA)'', note 8 at 16.&lt;/ref&gt; the role of the psychological element in the creation of customary law is uncertain.

=== ''Jus cogens'' ===
A [[peremptory norm]] or ''jus cogens'' ([[Latin]] for "compelling law" or "strong law") is a principle of international law considered so fundamental that it overrides all other sources of international law, including even the Charter of the [[United Nations]]. The principle of ''jus cogens'' is enshrined in Article 53 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]]:

:For the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognised by the international community of States as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.&lt;ref&gt;1155 [[United Nations Treaty Series|UNTS]] 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules of ''jus cogens'' generally require or forbid the state to do particular acts or respect certain rights. However, some define criminal offenses which the state must enforce against individuals. Generally included on lists of such norms are prohibitions of such crimes and internationally wrongful acts as waging aggressive [[war]], [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[pirate|piracy]], [[genocide]], [[apartheid]], [[slavery]] and [[torture]].

The evidence supporting the emergence of a rule of ''jus cogens'' will be essentially similar to that required to establish the creation of a new rule of customary international law. Indeed, ''jus cogens'' could be thought of as a special principle of custom with a superadded ''opinions juries''. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has stressed the international public policy aspect of the ''jus cogens''.

== General principles of law ==
The scope of general principles of law, to which Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ refers, is unclear and controversial but may include such legal principles that are common to a large number of systems of [[municipal law]]. Given the limits of treaties or custom as sources of international law, Article 38(1) may be looked upon as a directive to the Court to fill any gap in the law and prevent a [[nonliquet]] by reference to the general principles.

In earlier stages of the development of international law, rules were frequently drawn from municipal law. In the 19th century, legal positivists rejected the idea that international law could come from any source that did not involve state will or consent but were prepared to allow for the application of general principles of law, provided that they had in some way been accepted by states as part of the legal order. Thus Article 38(1)(c), for example, speaks of general principles "recognized" by states. An area that demonstrates the adoption of municipal approaches is the law applied to the relationship between international officials and their employing organizations,&lt;ref&gt;Amerasinghe, C., ''The Law of the International Civil Service'', 2nd rev. ed, vol. 1 (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1994) at 151–8.&lt;/ref&gt; although today the principles are regarded as established international law.

The significance of general principles has undoubtedly been lessened by the increased intensity of treaty and institutional relations between states. Nevertheless, the concepts of [[estoppel]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]] have been employed in the adjudication of international disputes. For example, a state that has, by its conduct, encouraged another state to believe in the existence of a certain legal or factual situation, and to rely on that belief, may be estopped from asserting a contrary situation in its dealings.&lt;ref&gt;See ''North Sea Continental Shelf'' cases, note 6 at 26; ''Flegenheimer Claim'' 25 ILR 91; ''Case Concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v Thailand) (Merits)'' [1962] ICJ Reports 6 at 32–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of good faith was said by the ICJ to be "[o]ne of the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations".&lt;ref&gt;''Nuclear Tests Cases (Australia v France; New Zealand v France)'' [1974] ICJ Reports 253 at 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there have been frequent references to equity.&lt;ref&gt;''River Meuse Case (Netherlands v Belgium)'' PCIJ Reports Series A/B No 70 76 at 76 per Judge Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally agreed that equity cannot be employed to subvert legal rules (that is, operate ''[[contra legem]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''Case Concerning the Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso v Republic of Mali) (Judgment)'' [1986] ICJ Reports 554 at 567–8; ''North Sea Continental Shelf'' cases, note 6 at 46–50.&lt;/ref&gt; This "equity as law" perception is reinforced by references to equitable principles in the text of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] 1982, though this may be little more than an admission as to the existence, and legitimation, of the discretion of the adjudicator.

However, the principles of estoppel and equity in the international context do not retain all the connotations they do under [[common law]]. The reference to the principles as "general" signify that, if rules were to be adapted from municipal law, they should be at a sufficient level of generality to encompass similar rules existing in many municipal systems. Principles of municipal law should be regarded as sources of inspiration rather than as sources of rules of direct application.&lt;ref&gt;''International Status of South-West Africa (Advisory Opinion)'' [1950] ICJ Reports 128 at 148.&lt;/ref&gt;
 

== Judicial decisions and juristic writings ==
According to Article 38(1)(d) of its Statute, the ICJ is also to apply "judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law". It is difficult to tell what influence these materials have on the development of the law. Pleadings in cases before the ICJ are often replete with references to [[case law]] and to legal literature.

=== Judicial decisions ===
The decisions of international and municipal courts and the publications of academics can be referred to, not as a source of law as such, but as a means of recognizing the law established in other sources. In practice, the [[International Court of Justice]] does not refer to domestic decisions although it does invoke its previous case-law. &lt;!-- this is not true, will change eventually, of course, the ICJ refers to decisions which by universal agreement express IL, especially ones preceding the existence of the ICJ. --&gt;

There is no rule of [[stare decisis]] in international law. The decision of the Court has no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.&lt;ref&gt;''Article 59 of the ICJ Statute'' [http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/index.php?p1=4&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=0 Statute of the International Court of Justice].&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, often the Court would refer to its past decisions and advisory opinions to support its explanation of a present case.

Often the International Court of Justice will consider General Assembly resolutions as indicative of customary international law.

=== Juristic writings ===
Article 38(1)(d) of the ''[[Statute of the International Court of Justice|International Court of Justice Statute]]'' states that the 'teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations' are also among the 'subsidiary means for the determination of the rules of law'. The scholarly works of prominent jurists are not sources of international law but are essential in developing the rules that are sourced in treaties, custom and the general principles of law. This is accepted practice in the interpretation of international law and was utilized by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''The Paquete Habana'' case (175 US (1900) 677 at 700-1).

==Reception==
[[Peter Sunde]], one of the main characters in the film, wrote on his blog, that he has "mixed feelings about the movie and the release of it". While he likes the technical side, he has serious issues with some scenes and general attitude of the film. This includes too much focus put on the trial, too dark depiction of it and portraying himself beyond self recognition. Despite having such different views on the subject, he regards the director as a friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sunde|first=Peter|title=TPB AFK – My Review|url=http://blog.brokep.com/2013/02/07/tpb-afk-my-review|publisher=Peter Sunde's blog|accessdate=20 February 2013|date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Werner Grothmann''' (23 August 1915 – 26 February 2002) was a mid-ranking commander in the [[Waffen-SS]] of [[Nazi Germany]] and ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] from 1940 until Himmler's death in 1945.

==Biography==
Grothmann was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1915. In his youth he studied [[economics]] and carved out a career as an [[accountant]] at a bank.  In 1933 he joined the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) at 18 years old, and was assigned to the ''Junkerschule SS''.  On 20 April 1936, he was commissioned an SS-''[[Untersturmführer]]'' ([[second lieutenant]]) and thereafter promoted to the rank of SS-''[[Obersturmführer]]'' ([[first lieutenant]]) on 11 September 1938. He was made the commander the ''Deutsches SS Standarten'' in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

At the beginning of the [[Second World War]], he had already reached the rank of SS-''[[Hauptsturmführer]]'' (captain) and was given command of ''SS-Sturmbann Nº 13'', a unit of the ''SS Standarte Deutschland''.  He was mobilized with his unit during the conquest of France and was wounded in combat in June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcap70.net/A%20History%20of%20the%20SS%20Organisation%201924-1945.html/G/GROTHMANN,%20Werner.html Index SS-Grothmann, Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the suggestion of [[Joachim Peiper]], Grothmann was appointed second assistant to ''Reichsführer-SS'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] until July 1942, when he was promoted to ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to the leader of the SS.  As  Himmler's aide, Grothmann accompanied him on all field visits.  In 1943 he was promoted to SS-''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' (major) and then to SS-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' (lieutenant colonel).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epier.com/product.asp?1723003 Color photograph of Grothmann with Himmler in the field]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last few days of the war in Europe, Himmler, Grothmann and [[Heinz Macher]] traveled from Lübeck to [[Flensburg]], where Himmler offered his services as second-in-command to the new [[Flensburg government|interim government]] led by [[Karl Dönitz]], successor to [[Adolf Hitler]]. Dönitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. Himmler was formally dismissed from all his posts.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=733–734}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=239, 243}}

Unwanted by his former colleagues and hunted by the Allies, Himmler attempted to go into hiding. Himmler had not made extensive preparations for this, but he had equipped himself with a forged paybook under the name of Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger of the ''[[Geheime Feldpolizei]]'' (Secret Field Police), which was a mistake since members of this organization were sought after by the liberation forces. Grothmann and Macher were both dressed as army privates.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=410}} Grothmann, Himmler, and Macher were stopped at a checkpoint, which had been set up by former Soviet POWs, on 21 May and detained. The three men were taken to an Allied barracks in [[Lüneburg]] on 23 May.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=410}} During a routine interrogation, Himmler admitted who he was, and was then taken to the headquarters of the Second British Army. During an attempted medical examination, Himmler bit into a hidden cyanide pill and died.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=410, 411}}  After Himmler's suicide, Grothmann and Macher were arrested.

Grothmann was taken to a barracks at [[Lübeck]], where he was extensively questioned.  He denied any knowledge of [[Operation Reinhard]].  Then he was taken to an SS prison camp.  Grothmann served as a prosecution witness against several SS officials between 1946 and 1948,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/captured-german-records/microfilm/m1019.pdf ''Records of the United States Nuernberg War Crimes trials Interrogations 1946-1949''] (PDF; 186&amp;nbsp;kB), published 1977&lt;/ref&gt; but during the trial of [[Karl Wolff]] he denied having any knowledge of the [[Final Solution]].  
After release from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] internment, Grothmann was [[denazification|denazified]], considered part of category III (Lesser Offenders), by a court in [[Freising]] in March 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[[Institut für Zeitgeschichte]]: [http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/archiv/zs/zs-0521.pdf ''Werner Grothmann – Zeugenschrifttum''] (PDF; 1,8&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

Grothmann remade his life as a [[businessman]] and granted a few interviews in the 1970s in which he disparaged Himmler's character. Werner Grothmann died in 2002.
