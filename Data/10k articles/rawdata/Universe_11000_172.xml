      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1626">The '''2009 Lüderitz oil spill''' began in April 2009 off the coast of [[Lüderitz]], [[Namibia]]. The oil spill directly affected 171 [[African penguin]]s, with many more possibly threatened. The oil spill is in the area where the fishing trawler ''[[Meob Bay]]'' sank in June 2002, killing 19 seamen. The boat sank after a rope got caught in the propeller, which then detached causing water to flood into the engine room. However, an inspection of the site where the vessel had sunk showed that the wreck was not the source of the oil; the source of the spill could not be found but is thought to be bunker oil that was released by a large vessel passing through Namibian waters. In terms of wildlife affected, it was the largest spill in Namibian history according to local residents of Lüderitz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namibian.com.na/news/full-story/archive/2009/april/article/oil-spill-hits-luederitz/ Oil spill hits Lüderitz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607185021/http://www.namibian.com.na/news/full-story/archive/2009/april/article/oil-spill-hits-luederitz/ |date=2011-06-07 }} The Namibian, 21 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5722">The '''Al Zour Refinery''' is an [[oil refinery]] under construction in [[Kuwait]], a member of [[OPEC]]. The [[Kuwait National Petroleum Company]] (KNPC) first released plans to build what would have been the country's fourth oil refinery in May&amp;nbsp;2006 before construction was postponed in March&amp;nbsp;2008 due to political opposition. Two years later, however, the government re-approved construction and [[Kuwait Integrated Petroleum Industries Company]] was created to manage its operations after 2019.&lt;ref name=manama&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwait to tender for oil refinery in June-official|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E8G8EZJ20120508|accessdate=12 June 2012|newspaper=Thompson Reuters|date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial plans==
The Kuwait National Petroleum Company released plans to construct the refinery in July&amp;nbsp;2007. In May&amp;nbsp;2008, it awarded construction contracts; the largest contracted was granted to a consortium of Japan's [[JGC Corporation]] and [[South Korea]]'s [[GS Group|GS]] Engineering &amp; Construction, covering the installation of six [[distillation]] and atmospheric residue desulphurisation units, and diesel, [[naphtha]], and kerosene [[Hydrodesulfurization|hydrotreating]] plants. Korea's [[SK Group|SK]] Engineering &amp; Construction was charged with constructing the [[hydrogen]] plants, as well as the compression and [[sulphur]] recovery units; [[Daelim]] Industrial was to construct storage tanks; and [[Hyundai]] Engineering and Construction was to be responsible for the marine works. U.S. engineering and construction firm [[Fluor Corporation]] was awarded the offsites and utilities contract.&lt;ref name =zawia&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; KNPC announced that it would be operational in 2012 and that it planned on spending approximately $14&amp;nbsp;billion on the project.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news|last=Ackerman|first=Ruthie|title=Kuwait Fluor Deal Falls Through|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/03/20/fluor-refinery-kuwait-markets-equity-oil.html|accessdate=12 June 2012|newspaper=Forbes|date=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery is expected to have a capacity of {{convert|615000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}, which would have made it the largest refinery in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=kuwaittimes&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
In March&amp;nbsp;2009, the Kuwaiti government informed the contractors to halt construction, citing a drop in [[Price of petroleum|oil prices]]. Some investment analysts predicted the project's cancellation as early as December&amp;nbsp;2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Daley|first=Will|title=Fluor Says Kuwait Halts $2.1 Billion in Refinery Work (Update4)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aoM0P55v5HZ8&amp;refer=energy|accessdate=12 June 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the project encountered political opposition by lawmakers who claimed that the government had not consulted the Central Tenders Committee before awarding contracts to foreign companies.&lt;ref name=fiona /&gt;

==Re-approval==
However, in June&amp;nbsp;2011, the Supreme Petroleum Council—Kuwait's oil agency—re-approved construction of the refinery in [[Al Ahmadi Governorate|Al Ahmadi]], Kuwait. Construction had been halted due to financial concerns and political wrangling, but the Oil Minister affirmed that Kuwait was indeed moving forward with the refinery that would be able to process 615,000&amp;nbsp;barrels of oil per day. The estimated cost is $14.5&amp;nbsp;billion, or 4&amp;nbsp;billion [[dinar]].&lt;ref name=fiona&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDonald |first=Fiona |title=Kuwait May Tap Private Investors for $14.5 Billion Refinery |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-06-28/kuwait-may-tap-private-investors-for-14-5-billion-refinery.html |accessdate=12 June 2012 |newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=28 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903204836/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-06-28/kuwait-may-tap-private-investors-for-14-5-billion-refinery.html |archivedate=3 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May&amp;nbsp;2012 Kuwait's three existing refineries produce 930,000&amp;nbsp;barrels per day.&lt;ref name=manama /&gt;

'''Alepu''' is a [[swamp]] on the [[Bulgaria]]n [[Black Sea]] coast, situated within [[Burgas Province]], 6.5 kilometers south of the [[resort town]] of [[Sozopol]]. It is {{Convert|3.3|km|mi}} long and up to {{Convert|320|m|ft}} wide, with an area of {{Convert|167|ha|acre}}. Since 1986, the area has been designated a [[nature reserve]] due to the large variety of rare and protected [[water bird]]s who live there, and has sustained significant interest from local and foreign [[ornithology|ornithologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=407 |title=Birdlife Data Zone |publisher=Birdlife.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dune|sand dunes]] adjacent to the reserve have also been designated as protected. Because of the lax protection from the local authorities, illegal hunting and fishing remain a threat to the reserve.  It forms part of the [[Ropotamo]] [[Important Bird Area]].

The [[beach]] across from Alepu is known for its scenic beauty and aquamarine water. Up until the building of the Saint Thomas resort complex in 2009, it was known as one of the few truly wild beaches in Bulgaria.

[[Alepu Rocks]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] are named after the Alepu locality.

[[File:ARPESgeneral.png|thumb|An Experimental Setup of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy]]
[[File:Photoemission and metals.ogv|thumb|upright=1.5|Photoemission and metals]]

'''Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy''' ('''ARPES'''), is a direct experimental technique to observe the distribution of the [[electrons]] (more precisely, the density of single-particle electronic excitations) in the [[reciprocal space]] of solids. The technique is a refinement of ordinary [[photoemission spectroscopy]], studying photoemission of electrons from a sample achieved usually by illumination with soft X-rays. ARPES is one of the most direct methods of studying the electronic structure of the surface of solids.

ARPES gives information on the direction, speed and scattering process of [[valence electrons]] in the sample being studied (usually a solid).  This means that information can be gained on both the energy and momentum of an electron, resulting in detailed information on band dispersion and [[Fermi surface]].

The technique is also known as '''ARUPS''' (angle-resolved [[ultraviolet]] [[photoemission spectroscopy]]) when using ultraviolet light (as opposed to X-rays) to generate photoemission. 

==Band mapping==
'''Band mapping''', in [[condensed matter physics]] refers to the process which allows for detection (and measurement) of [[photoelectron]]s emitted from an observed surface at different emission angles. This process is employed in ARPES. ARPES is used to investigate the electronic structure of solids, solid surfaces and interfaces.

By employing the band mapping process, several fundamental physical properties of a solid can be determined.   The properties which can be determined using this process include (but are not limited to) the following:

*[[Kinetic energy]] of the electron(s);
*Elasticity;
*Electrical/Magnetic properties; and
*Optical properties.

The electronic states in the solid are described by [[energy band]]s, which have associated energy band dispersions '''''E'''''('''k''') &amp;mdash; energy [[eigenvalue]]s for delocalized electrons in a [[crystalline]] medium according to [[Bloch wave|Bloch's theorem]]. 

Band mapping has an advantage over [[optical spectroscopy]]. In the latter, only the energy-band separations at various optical critical points in k-space &amp;mdash; energy between the initial and final states &amp;mdash; are determined. ARPES, on the other hand, provides information about the absolute location of energy bands at different values of k relative to the [[Fermi level]] (E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Theory==
From conservation of energy, we have
:&lt;math&gt; E = \hbar  \omega - E_{B} - \phi&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt; \hbar \omega&lt;/math&gt; is the incoming photon energy — measured
*&lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; is the kinetic energy of the outgoing electron — measured
*&lt;math&gt; E_{B} &lt;/math&gt; is the binding energy of the electron
*&lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is the electron [[work function]] (energy required to remove electron from sample to vacuum)
Photon momentum is often neglected because of its relatively small contribution compared with electron momentum.

In the typical case, where the surface of the sample is smooth, translational symmetry requires that the component of electron momentum in the plane of the sample be conserved:
:&lt;math&gt; \hbar k_{i\parallel}=\hbar k_{\parallel}=\sqrt{2m E}\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;\hbar k&lt;/math&gt; is the momentum of the outgoing electron — measured by angle
*&lt;math&gt;\hbar k_i&lt;/math&gt; is the initial momentum of the electron

However, the normal component of electron momentum &lt;math&gt;k_{i\perp}&lt;/math&gt; might not be conserved. The typical way of dealing with this is to assume that the final in-crystal states are free-electron-like, in which case one has
:&lt;math&gt;k_{i\perp}=\frac{1}{\hbar}\sqrt{2m(E \cos^2\theta+V_0)}&lt;/math&gt;
in which &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the band depth from vacuum, including electron work function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; can be determined by examining only the electrons emitted perpendicular to the surface, measuring their kinetic energy as a function of incident photon energy.

The equations for energy and momentum can be solved to determine the dispersion relation between the binding energy, &lt;math&gt; E_{B} &lt;/math&gt;, and the wave vector, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{k}_i=\mathbf{k}_{i\parallel}+\mathbf{k}_{i\perp} &lt;/math&gt;, of the electron.

The city is renowned for its harsh winds, which is reflected in its nickname, the "[[City of Winds]]".

== Etymology ==
Baku is derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] name of the city باد-کوبه ''Bād-kube'', meaning "Wind-pounded city", in which ''bād'' means "wind" and ''kube'' is rooted in the verb کوبیدن ''kubidan'', "to pound", thus referring to a place where wind is strong and pounding.&lt;ref name="Web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013212555/http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php |archivedate=13 October 2007 |title=Culture &amp; Religion on Podium: Politicizing Linguistics |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=25 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds. This is also reflected in the city's nickname as the "[[City of Winds]]". A less probable [[folk etymology]] explains the name as deriving from ''Baghkuy'', meaning "God's town". ''Baga'' (now ''بغ'' ''bagh'') and ''kuy'' are the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] words for "god" and "town" respectively; the name ''Baghkuy'' may be compared with ''[[Baghdad|Baghdād]]'' ("God-given") in which ''dād'' is the Old Persian word for "give". [[Arabic language|Arabic]] sources refer to the city as ''Baku'', ''Bakukh'', ''Bakuya'', and ''Bakuye'', all of which seem to come from a Persian name.

During [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet rule]], the city was spelled in Cyrillic as "Баку"{{Specify|date=November 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} in Russian and «Бакы» in Azerbaijani. Nowadays, when Azerbaijan is using the Latin alphabet, it is spelled as "Bakı".

{{Main|History of Baku|Timeline of Baku}}

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Qobustan inscription.jpg|thumb|Roman stone inscription in [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]] dating back to 84–96 A.D.]]
Around 100,000 years ago, the territory of modern Baku and [[Absheron Rayon|Absheron]] was [[savanna]] with rich flora and fauna.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Traces of human settlement go back to the [[Stone age]]. From the [[Bronze age]] there have been rock carvings discovered near Bayil, and a bronze figure of a small fish discovered in the territory of the Old City. These have led some to suggest the existence of a Bronze Age settlement within the city's territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azerisite.narod.ru/2.html Город Баку...] Retrieved on 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Near [[Nardaran]], in a place called Umid Gaya, a prehistoric observatory was discovered, where on the rock the images of sun and various constellations are carved together with a primitive astronomic table.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Observatory of Absheron. ''Gobustan'', No 3 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Further archeological excavations revealed various prehistoric settlements, native temples, statues and other artifacts within the territory of the modern city and around it.

In the 1st century CE, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] organized two Caucasian campaigns and reached Baku. Near the city, in [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]], Roman inscriptions dating from 84–96&amp;nbsp;CE were discovered. This is one of the earliest written evidences for Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080102011734/http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm |archivedate=2 January 2008 |title=Azerbaijan – Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace... |accessdate=14 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise of the Shirvanshahs and the Safavid era ===
{{See also|Shirvanshah}}
[[File:1541-Battle in the war between Shah Isma'il and the King of Shirvan-Shahnama-i-Isma'il.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature painting]] marking the downfall of the Shirvanshahs at the hands of the Safavids.]]
Baku was the realm of the [[Shirvanshahs]] during the 8th century CE. The city frequently came under assault of the [[Khazars]] and (starting from the 10th century) the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]]. [[Akhsitan I ibn Minuchihr III|Shirvanshah Akhsitan I]] built a navy in Baku and successfully repelled another Rus assault in 1170. After a devastating earthquake struck [[Shamakhi]], the capital of [[Shirvan]], Shirvanshah’s court moved to Baku in 1191.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaspiy.az/rubrics.php?code=316 "Ичери Шехер": быть или не быть] Retrieved on 25 June 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620120625/http://www.kaspiy.az/rubrics.php?code=316 |date=20 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sabayil relics.jpg|thumb|Relics from the sunken [[Sabayil Castle]].]]
The Shirvan era greatly influenced Baku and the remainder of what is present-day Azerbaijan. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, massive fortifications were undertaken in Baku and the surrounding towns. The [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]], the [[Ramana Tower]], the [[Nardaran Fortress]], the Shagan Castle, the [[Quadrangular castle (Mardakan)|Mardakan Castle]], the [[Round Castle (Mardakan)|Round Castle]] and also the famous [[Sabayil Castle]] on the island of the [[Bay of Baku]] was built during this period. The [[Old City (Baku)|city walls of Baku]] were also rebuilt and strengthened.

By the early 16th century Baku's wealth and strategic position attracted the focus of its larger neighbors; in the previous two centuries, it was under the rule of the in Iran-centred [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]]. The fall of the Ak Koyunlu brought the city immediately into the sphere of the newly formed Iranian [[Safavid dynasty]], led by king (''[[shah]]'') [[Ismail I]] (r. 1501–1524). Ismail I laid siege to Baku in 1501 and captured it; he allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power, under Safavid suzerainty. His successor, king [[Tahmasp I]] (r. 1524–1576), completely removed the Shirvanshahs from power, and made Baku a part of the [[Safavid Shirvan|Shirvan]] province. Baku remained as an integral part of his empire and the successive Iranian dynasties to come for the next centuries, until the irrevocable cession in the [[Treaty of Gulistan|first half of the 19th century]]. The House of Shirvan, who ruled Baku since the 9th century, was extinguished in the course of the Safavid rule.

At this time the city was enclosed within the lines of strong walls, which were washed by the sea on one side and protected by a wide trench on land. The Ottomans briefly gained control over Baku as a result of the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578-1590)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578–1590]]; by 1607, it was again put under Iranian control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&amp;pg=PA65|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-919-5|author1=Dumper|first1=Michael|last2=Stanley|first2=Bruce E|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1604 Baku fortress was destroyed by Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] (r. 1588-1629).

Baku is noted for being a focal point for traders from all across the world during the [[Early modern period]], commerce was active and the area was prosperous. Notably, traders from the [[Indian subcontinent]] established themselves in the region.

In the wake of the demise of the Safavids, the Russians took advantage of the situation [[Russo-Persian War (1722-1723)|and invaded]]; the Safavids were forced to cede Baku to Russia for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/the-caucasus-in-the-system-of-international-relations-the-turkmanchay-treaty-was-signed-180-years-ago|title=THE CAUCASUS IN THE SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: THE TURKMANCHAY TREATY WAS SIGNED 180 YEARS AGO|author=SHUKIUROV KERIM|work=Cyberleninka|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1730, the situation had deteriorated for the Russians; the successes of [[Nader Shah]] (r. 1736–1747) forced them to make an [[Treaty of Ganja|agreement]] near [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] on 10 March 1735, ceding the city and all other conquered territories in the Caucasus back to [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mikaberidze|first=Alexander|title=Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia|year=2011|location=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-59884-336-2|page=329|editor=Mikaberidze, Alexander|chapter=Treaty of Ganja (1735)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was ruled by Mirza Muhammed Khan but soon became a dependency of the much stronger [[Quba Khanate]]. During this time, the population of Baku was small (approximately 5,000), and the economy was ruined as a result of constant warfare.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Russo-Persian Wars and Iran's forced ceding ===
[[File:Баку. Набережная. 1861.jpg|left|thumb|Painting of Baku's shoreline in 1861 by [[Alexey Bogolyubov]].]]

From the late 18th century, Imperial Russia switched to a more aggressive geopolitical stance towards its two neighbors and rivals to the south, namely Iran and the Ottoman Empire. In the spring of 1796, by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]]’s order, General [[Valerian Zubov]]’s troops started [[Persian Expedition of 1796|a large campaign]] against [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/9137125/Relations_between_Tehran_and_Moscow_1979-2014|title=Relations between Tehran and Moscow, 1797–2014|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zubov had sent 13,000 men to capture Baku, and it was overrun subsequently without any resistance. On 13 June 1796, a Russian flotilla entered Baku Bay, and a garrison of Russian troops was placed inside the city. Later, however, [[Paul I of Russia|Pavel I]] ordered the cessation of the campaign and the withdrawal of Russian forces following his predecessor, [[Catherine the Great]]'s death. In March 1797, the tsarist troops left Baku and the city became part of [[Qajar Iran]] again.

In 1813, following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813]], Qajar Iran was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] with Russia, which provided for the irrevocable cession of Baku and most of Iran's territories in the [[North Caucasus]] and [[South Caucasus]] to Russia. During the next and final bout of hostilities between the two, the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)|Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828]], Baku was briefly recaptured by the Iranians. However, militarily superior, the Russians ended this war in a victory as well, and the resulting [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] made its inclusion into the [[Russian Empire]] definite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mojtahed-Zadeh, Pirouz|year=2007|title=Boundary Politics and International Boundaries of Iran: A Study of the Origin, Evolution, and Implications of the Boundaries of Modern Iran with Its 15 Neighbors in the Middle East by a Number of Renowned Experts in the Field|publisher=Universal|isbn=1-58112-933-5|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|war of 1804–13]], nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat]].&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"&gt;{{cite book|author=James B.

=== Discovery of oil ===
{{Main|Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan}}
[[File:BibiEybat.jpg|thumb|Oil workers digging an oil well by hand at Bibi-Heybat.]]

Drilling for oil began in the mid-1800s, with the first [[oil well]] drilled in the [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque|Bibi-Heybat]] suburb of Baku in 1846. It was mechanically drilled, though a number of hand-dug wells predate it. Large-scale oil exploration started in 1872 when Russian imperial authorities auctioned the parcels of oil-rich land around Baku to private investors. The pioneer of oil extracting from the bottom of the sea was Polish geologist Witold Zglenicki.&lt;ref&gt;[[Witold Zglenicki]]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that Swiss, British, French, Belgian, German, Swedish and American investors appeared in Baku. Among them were the firms of the [[Robert Nobel|Nobel brothers]] together with the family [[Schuch|von Börtzell-Szuch]] (Carl Knut Börtzell, who also owned the [[Livadia Palace]]) and the [[Rothschild family]]. An industrial oil belt, better known as Black City, was established near Baku.

Professor [[A. V. Williams Jackson]] of Columbia University wrote in his work ''From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam'' (1911):
{{quotation|Baku is a city founded upon oil, for to its inexhaustible founts of naphtha it owes its very existence, its maintenance, its prosperity... At present Baku produces one-fifth of the oil that is used in the world, and the immense output in crude petroleum from this single city far surpasses that in any other district where oil is found. Verily, the words of the Scriptures find illustration here: 'the rock poured me out rivers of oil.

Oil is in the air one breathes, in one's nostrils, in one's eyes, in the water of the morning bath (though not in the drinking water, for that is brought in bottles from distant mineral springs), in one's starched linen – everywhere. This is the impression one carries away from Baku, and it is certainly true in the environs.''&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson. {{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/fromconstantino00jackgoog#page/n10/mode/2up|title=From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam|publisher=The Macmillan Company, 1911, p. 25|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the beginning of the 20th century, half of the oil sold in international markets was being extracted in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVABAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 |title=Troubled Waters: The Geopolitics of the Caspian Region |publisher=I.B. Tauris|authors=R.Hrair Dekmejian, Hovann H. Simonian |year=2003|page=16|isbn=978-0-85771-755-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[oil boom]] contributed to the massive growth of Baku. Between 1856 and 1910 Baku's population grew at a faster rate than that of [[London]], [[Paris]] or [[New York City|New York]].

=== World War I ===
[[File:Army of Azerbaijan in 1918.jpg|thumb|Soldiers and officers of the army of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic shortly after the [[Battle of Baku]].]]
[[File:Neftchiler Avenue 1918-1920.jpg|thumb|[[Neftchiler Avenue]] in Baku, circa 1920.]]
In 1917, after the [[October Revolution|October revolution]] and amidst the turmoil of [[World War I]] and the [[Russian revolution|breakup of the Russian Empire]], Baku came under the control of the [[26 Baku Commissars|Baku Commune]], which was led by veteran Bolshevik [[Stepan Shahumyan]]. Seeking to capitalize on the existing inter-ethnic conflicts, by spring 1918, Bolsheviks inspired and condoned civil warfare in and around Baku. During the infamous [[March Days]], Bolsheviks and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]] seeking to establish control over Baku streets, were faced with armed Azerbaijani groups. The Azerbaijanis suffered a crushing defeat by the united forces of Baku Soviet and were massacred by Dashnak teams in what was called [[March Days]]. An estimated 3–12,000 Azerbaijanis were killed in their own capital.&lt;ref name="smithmusavat"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Michael |last2= |first2= |date=April 2001 |title=Anatomy of Rumor: Murder Scandal, the Musavat Party and Narrative of the Russian Revolution in Baku, 1917–1920 |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |publisher= |volume=36 |issue=2 |page=228 |url= |doi= 10.1177/002200940103600202|quote=''The results of the March events were immediate and total for the Musavat.

I.B.Tauris, 2000. {{ISBN|1-86064-822-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-86064-822-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The newly independent Azerbaijani republic, being unable to defend the independence of the country on their own, asked the Ottoman Empire for military support in accordance with clause 4 of the treaty between the two countries. Shortly after, Azerbaijani forces, with support of the [[Ottoman Army of Islam]] led by [[Nuri Killigil|Nuru Pasha]], started their advance onto Baku, eventually capturing the city from the loose coalition of [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Esers]], [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]], [[Menshevik]]s and British forces under the command of General [[Lionel Dunsterville]] on 15 September 1918.

After the [[Battle of Baku]], the Azerbaijani irregular troops, with the tacit support of the Turkish command, conducted four days of pillaging and killing of 10–30,000&lt;ref name="Gen"&gt;Andreopoulos, George (1997). ''Genocide: Conceptual and Historical Dimensions''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, {{ISBN|0-8122-1616-4}}, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Armenians in Baku|Armenian residents of Baku]]. This pogrom was known as the [[September Days]]. Shortly after this Baku was proclaimed the new capital of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

With Turkey having lost the war by October 1918 they conducted the [[Armistice of Mudros]] with the British which meant Baku was to be evacuated. Headed by General [[William Montgomery Thomson|William Thomson]], British troops of 5,000 soldiers, including parts of Dunsterforce, arrived in Baku on 17 November. Thomson declared himself military governor of Baku and implemented [[Martial law]] on the capital until "the civil power would be strong enough to release the forces from the responsibility to maintain the public order". British forces left before the end of 1919 having felt they had done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Behbudov|first1=Tahir|title=British Police in Baku|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/99/afcf2df0/|website=Visions of Azerbaijan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet period ===
The independence of the Azerbaijani republic was significant but a short-lived chapter. On 28 April 1920, the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Red Army]] invaded Baku and reinstalled the Bolsheviks, making Baku the capital of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]].

The city underwent many major changes. As a result, Baku played a great role in many branches of the Soviet life. Since about 1921, the city was headed by Baku City Executive Committee, commonly known in Russian as ''Bakgorispolkom''. Together with Baku Party Committee (known as the ''Baksovet''), it developed the economic significance of the Caspian metropolis. From 1922 to 1930, Baku was the venue for one of the major [[Trade fair]]s of the Soviet Union, serving as a commercial bridgehead to Iran and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Forestier-Peyrat, ″[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ab_imperio/summary/v2013/2013.4.forestier-peyrat.html Red Passage to Iran: Baku Trade Fair and the Unmaking of the Azerbaijani Borderland, 1922–1930]″, ''Ab Imperio'', Vol 2013, Issue 4, pp. 79–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===
Baku's growing importance as a major energy hub remained in sight of the major powers. During [[World War II]] and the [[Case Blue|Nazi German invasion of the southwestern Soviet Union]], Baku had become of vital strategic importance. In fact, capturing the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan#World War II|oil fields of Baku]] was one of the ultimate goals of [[Operation Edelweiss]], carried out between May and November 1942. However, the German Army's closest approach to Baku was no closer than some {{convert|530|km|0|abbr=off}} northwest of Baku in November 1942, falling far short of the city's capture before being driven back during the Soviet [[Operation Little Saturn]] in mid-December 1942.

=== Fall of the Soviet Union and later ===
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Baku embarked on a process of restructuring on a scale unseen in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Money from oil changes the face of Azerbaijan|url=http://news.az/articles/society/41029|publisher=news.az|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of buildings from the Soviet period were demolished to make way for a green belt on its shores; parks and gardens were built on the land reclaimed by filling up the beaches of the [[Baku Bay]]. Improvements were made in the general cleaning, maintenance, and garbage collection, and these services are now at Western European standards. The city is growing dynamically and developing at full speed on an east-west axis along the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Sustainability has become a key factor in future urban development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakuwhitecity.com/en/page/4-sustainability|title=Baku White City – Sustainability|website=www.bakuwhitecity.com|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Baku, Azerbaijan, satellite image, LandSat-5, 2010-09-06.jpg|thumb|Absheron Peninsular satellite image, [[Landsat 5]], 6 September 2010]]
Baku is situated on the western coast of [[Caspian Sea]]. In the vicinity of the city there are a number of [[mud volcano]]es (Keyraki, Bogkh-bogkha, [[Lokbatan]] and others) and [[salt lake]]s ([[Lake Boyukshor|Boyukshor]], Khodasan and so on).

=== Climate ===
Baku has a [[temperate]] [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BSk'') with hot and humid summers, cool and occasionally wet winters, and strong winds all year long. However, unlike many other cities with such climate features, Baku does not see extremely hot summers. This is largely because of its northerly [[latitude]] and the fact that it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea. Baku and the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on which it is situated, is the most arid part of Azerbaijan ([[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] here is around or less than {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} a year). The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer, but none of these seasons are particularly wet.
During Soviet times, Baku with its long hours of sunshine and dry healthy climate, was a vacation destination where citizens could enjoy beaches or relax in now-dilapidated [[destination spa|spa]] complexes overlooking the Caspian Sea. The city's past as a Soviet industrial center has left it as one of the most polluted cities in the world.&lt;ref name="ForbesPollution"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/26/pollution-baku-oil-biz-logistics-cx_tl_0226dirtycities.html |title=The World's Dirtiest Cities |work=Forbes |author=Tiffany M. Luck |date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=17 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202072636/http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/26/pollution-baku-oil-biz-logistics-cx_tl_0226dirtycities.html |archivedate=2 December 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Baku is noted as a very windy city throughout the year, hence the city's nickname the "[[City of Winds]]", and gale-force winds, the cold northern wind ''[[khazri]]'' and the warm southern wind ''[[gilavar]]'' are typical here in all seasons. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds.&lt;ref name="Web.archive.org"/&gt;
The speed of the ''khazri'' sometimes reaches 144 kph (89&amp;nbsp;mph), which can cause damage to crops, trees and roof tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-ict.mincom.gov.az/aboutazerb.php |title=Global ICT Conference: 25–28, November, 2004 : Baku, Azerbaijan |publisher=Global-ict.mincom.gov.az |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719093010/http://www.global-ict.mincom.gov.az/aboutazerb.php |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daily mean temperature in July and August averages {{convert|26.4|°C|°F}}, and there is very little rainfall during that season. During summer the ''khazri'' sweeps through, bringing desired coolness. Winter is cool and occasionally wet, with the daily mean temperature in January and February averaging {{convert|4.3|°C|°F}}. During winter the ''khazri'' sweeps through, driven by polar [[air mass]]es; temperatures on the coast frequently drop below freezing and make it feel bitterly cold. Winter [[Winter storm|snow storms]] are occasional; [[snow]] usually melts within a few days after each snowfall.

== Demographics ==
Until 1988 Baku had very large Russian, Armenian, and Jewish populations which contributed to [[cultural diversity]] and added in various ways (music, literature, architecture and progressive outlook) to Baku's history. With the onset of the [[Karabakh War]] and the [[Pogrom of Armenians in Baku|pogrom against Armenians]] starting in January 1990, the city's large Armenian population was expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Azerbaijan: The status of Armenians, Russians, Jews and other minorities, report, 1993, INS Resource Informacion Center, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-44300/Azerbaijan#481451.hook |title=Azerbaijan – The Soviet and post-Soviet periods |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under Communism, the Soviets took over the majority of Jewish property in Baku and Kuba. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[President of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani President]] [[Heydar Aliyev]] returned several synagogues and a Jewish college, nationalized by the Soviets, to the Jewish community. He encouraged the restoration of these buildings and is well liked by the Jews of Azerbaijan. Renovation has begun on seven of the original 11 synagogues, including the Gilah synagogue, built in 1896, and the large Kruei Synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Azerbaijan.html |title=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |publisher=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |date=10 July 2006 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnic groups ===
[[File:Christmas in Baku on January 6, 1904 and Armenian church.jpg|thumb|The Armenian [[Saint Gregory the Illuminator's Church, Baku]]]]
Today the vast majority of the population of Baku are ethnic [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] (more than 90%). When Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|war of 1804–13]], nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat]].&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"/&gt; The intensive growth of the population started in the middle of the 19th century when Baku was a small town with a population of about 7,000 people. The population increased again from about 13,000 in the 1860s to 112,000 in 1897 and 215,000 in 1913, making Baku the largest city in the Caucasus region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-946.html |title=Country-data.com |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baku has been a cosmopolitan city at certain times during its history, meaning ethnic Azerbaijanis did not constitute the majority of population.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Altstadt, Conflict, Cleavage and Change in Central Asia and the Caucasus, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997, p. 112, table 4.1, Ethnic composition of Baku, 1897, 1903,1913&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Baku additionally had 153,400 [[internally displaced person]]s and 93,400 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701132551/http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm |archivedate=1 July 2007 |script-title=ru:Баку |accessdate=15 July 2007 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
[[File:Bibi-Eybat mosque, Baku, 2009.jpg|thumb|The 13th century [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]]. The mosque was built over the tomb of a descendant of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Bibi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharifov|first=Azad|title=Legend of the Bibi-Heybat Mosque|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/63_folder/63_articles/63_bibiheybat.html|publisher=Azerbaijan International Magazine|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The urban landscape of Baku is shaped by many communities. The religion with the largest community of followers is Islam. The majority of the Muslims are [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], and the Republic of Azerbaijan has the second highest Shia population percentage in the world after [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo,''Encyclopedia of Islam'', p.625&lt;/ref&gt; The city's notable mosques include [[Juma Mosque (Baku)|Juma Mosque]], [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]], [[Muhammad Mosque (Baku)|Muhammad Mosque]] and [[Taza Pir Mosque]].

There are some other faiths practiced among the different ethnic groups within the country. By article 48 of its [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]], Azerbaijan is a [[secular state]] and ensures religious freedom. Religious minorities include [[Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox Christians]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Catholic Levantines]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Orthodox Christians]], [[Lutherans]], [[Azerbaijani Jews|Ashkenazi]] Jews and [[Sufi]] Muslims.

[[Zoroastrianism]], although extinct in the city as well as in the rest of the country by the present time, had a long [[Zoroastrianism in Azerbaijan|history in Azerbaijan]] and the [[Nowruz|Zoroastrian New Year]] (Nowruz) continues to be the main holiday in the city as well as in the rest of Azerbaijan.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Baku}}
Baku's largest industry is petroleum, and its petroleum exports make it a large contributor to Azerbaijan's [[balance of payments]]. The existence of petroleum has been known since the 8th century. In the 10th century, the Arabian traveler, Marudee, reported that both white and black oil were being extracted naturally from Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/22_folder/22_articles/22_historyofoil.html |title=The History of Oil in Azerbaijan by Natig Aliyev |publisher=Azer.com |accessdate=22 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424163308/http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/22_folder/22_articles/22_historyofoil.html |archivedate=24 April 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century, oil for lamps was obtained from hand-dug surface wells.
Commercial exploitation began in 1872, and by the beginning of the 20th century the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|Baku oil fields]] were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century [[skilled worker]]s and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] equipment before World War II. The World War II [[Battle of Stalingrad]] was fought to determine who would have control of Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aghazade|first=Emil|title=Азербайджан: сто лет надежд|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/business/newsid_4649000/4649873.stm|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=12 May 2011|date=4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the oil economy of Baku is undergoing a resurgence, with the development of the massive [[Azeri–Chirag–Guneshli|Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli]] field (Shallow water Gunashli by [[State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic|SOCAR]], deeper areas by a consortium led by [[BP]]), development of the [[Shah Deniz gas field]], the expansion of the [[Sangachal Terminal]] and the construction of the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline|BTC Pipeline]].

The [[Baku Stock Exchange]] is Azerbaijan's largest [[stock exchange]], and largest in the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] region by [[market capitalization]]. A relatively large number of transnational companies are headquartered in Baku. One of the more prominent institutions headquartered in Baku is the [[International Bank of Azerbaijan]], which employs over 1,000 people. International banks with branches in Baku include [[HSBC]], [[Société Générale]] and [[Credit Suisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abdullayev |first=Rovshan |title=Which foreign banks has Azerbaijan capital been trusted in? |url=http://www.nhmt-az.org/ts_general/eng/news/n-6.htm |accessdate=6 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518140408/http://www.nhmt-az.org/ts_general/eng/news/n-6.htm |archivedate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tourism and shopping ===
Baku is one of the most important tourist destinations in the Caucasus, with hotels in the city earning 7 million euros in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azerbaijan24.com/component/content/article/1-latest-news/224-hotels-in-baku.html |title=Hotels in Baku earned 6,8 million euros last year |publisher=Azerbaijan24.com |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917135847/http://azerbaijan24.com/component/content/article/1-latest-news/224-hotels-in-baku.html |archivedate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sizable world [[hotel chain]]s have a presence in the city. Baku has many popular tourist and entertainment spots, such as the downtown [[Fountains Square, Baku|Fountains Square]], the One and Thousand Nights Beach, [[Shikhov Beach]] and [[Oil Rocks]]. Baku's vicinities feature [[Yanar Dag]], an ever-blazing spot of natural gas. On 2 September 2010, with the inauguration of [[National Flag Square]], Baku became home to the world's tallest [[flagpole]], according to the [[Guinness Book of Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijani flag flies on world's tallest flagpole |url=http://news.az/articles/22041 |publisher=news.az |accessdate=2 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904092905/http://www.news.az/articles/22041 |archivedate=4 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=İşte dünyanın en yüksek bayrak direği |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25128411/ |language=Turkish |publisher=ntvmsnbc.com |accessdate=2 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100904080023/http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25128411/ |archivedate=4 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 24 May 2011 Baku lost this record by just {{convert|3|m|abbr=off}} to the city of Dushanbe in Tajikistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-1/tallest-unsupported-flagpole|title=Guinness World Records|author=|date=|work=guinnessworldrecords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2017, the Flag Pole is dismantled and the National Flag Square closed with fences.

Baku has several shopping malls; the most famous city center malls are Port Baku, [[Park Bulvar]], Ganjlik Mall, [[Metro Park]], [[28 MALL]], [[Aygun city]] and [[AF MALL]]. The retail areas contain shops from chain stores up to high-end boutiques.

The city is listed 48th in the 2011 [[List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees|list]] of the most expensive cities in the world conducted by the [[Mercer Human Resource Consulting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24264196.html |title=Bakı dünyanın ən bahalı 48-ci şəhəridir, 13 July 2011, Azadlıq Radiosu. Retrieved 13 July 2011 |publisher=Azadliq.org |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Nizami Street]] is one of the most expensive streets in the world.

== Culture ==
The city has many amenities that offer a wide range of cultural activities, drawing both from a rich local dramatic portfolio and an international repertoire. In 2007 the [[Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center]] designed by famous Iraqi-British architect, Zaha Hadid, was opened&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heydaraliyevcenter.az/#1_AboutUs|title=Heydər Əliyev Mərkəzi|website=heydaraliyevcenter.az|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Baku also boasts many museums such as [[Baku Museum of Modern Art]] and [[Azerbaijan State Museum of History]], most notably featuring historical artifacts and [[art museum|art]]. Many of the city's cultural sites were celebrated in 2009 when Baku was designated an Islamic Culture Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.az/eng/news/41154.html |title=Closing ceremony of Cultural Year "Baku- Islamic Culture Capital-2009" conducted in Azerbaijan |author=Azerbaijan Business Center |accessdate=5 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811020803/https://abc.az/eng/news/41154.html |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baku was chosen to host the [[Eurovision Dance Contest]] 2010. It has also become the first city hosting the first European Games in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baku2015.com/|title=Baku 2015 European Games|website=Baku 2015|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Architecture ==
{{Main|Architecture in Baku}}
[[File:Baku Maiden Tower 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]] in [[Old Baku]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] built in the 11th–12th century, recognised as the symbol of the city.]]
[[File:Baku, Azerbaiyán, 2016-09-26, DD 207-209 PAN.jpg|thumb|[[Caravanserai]] in Baku.]]
Baku has wildly varying architecture, ranging from the [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]] core to modern buildings and the spacious layout of Baku port. Many of the city's most impressive buildings were built during the early 20th century, when architectural elements of the European styles were combined in [[eclecticism|eclectic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_architecture.html |title=Baku's Architecture:A Fusion of East and West |publisher=Azer.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baku has an original and unique appearance, earning it a reputation as the 'Paris of the East'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window2baku.com/006development.htm Архитектурное развитие города] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamams ===

The [[Turkish bath|Hamam]] tradition in Baku is interesting. There are a number of ancient hamams in Baku dating back to the 12th, 14th and 18th centuries. Hamams play a very important role in the architectural appearance of Baku.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.azernews.az/travel/62986.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Teze Bey Hamam ====
Teze Bey is the most popular hamam (traditional bath) in Baku. It was built in 1886 in the center of Baku and in 2003 it was fully restored and modernized. Along with its modern amenities, Teze Bey features a swimming pool and architectural details inspired by Oriental, Russian and Finnish baths.

==== Gum Hamam ====
Gum Hamam was discovered during archaeological excavations underneath the sand; hence the name: Gum hamam (sand bath). It was built sometime during the 12th–14th centuries.

==== Bairamali hamam ====
In ancient times Bairamali Hamam was called “Bey Hamam”. The original structure was built sometime during the 12th–14th centuries and was reconstructed in 1881.

==== Agha Mikayil Hamam ====
Agha Mikayil Hamam was constructed in the 18th century by Haji Agha Mikayil on Kichik Gala Street in the Old City (icherisheher). It is still operating in its ancient setting. The Hamam is open to women on Mondays and Fridays and to men on the other days of the week.

=== Modern Architecture ===
 
Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the early 2000s. With economic development, old buildings such as Atlant House were razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells have appeared around the city, the most prominent examples being the [[Azerbaijan Tower]], [[Heydar Aliyev Center|Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center]], [[Flame Towers]], [[Baku Crystal Hall]], [[Baku White City]] and [[SOCAR Tower]]. These projects also caught the attention of international media as notable programmes such as [[Discovery Channel]]'s [[Extreme Engineering]] did pieces focusing in on changes to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center And Flame Towers|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv/build-bigger/projects/azerbaijan/heydar-aliyev-cultural-center.html|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old City of Baku, also known as the Walled City of Baku, refers to the ancient Baku settlement. Most of the walls and towers, strengthened after the Russian conquest in 1806, survived. This section is picturesque, with its maze of narrow alleys and ancient buildings: the cobbled streets past the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]], two [[Caravanserai|caravansaries]], the baths and the [[Juma Mosque (Baku)|Juma Mosque]] (which used to house the [[Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum|Azerbaijan National Carpet and Arts Museum]] but is now a mosque again). The old town core also has dozens of small mosques, often without any particular sign to distinguish them as such.

In 2003, UNESCO placed the Inner City on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]], citing damage from a [[2000 Baku earthquake|November 2000 earthquake]], poor conservation as well as "dubious" restoration efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |title=Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Inner City was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger.&lt;ref&gt;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music and media ===
[[File:Pht-Vugar Ibadov eurovision (31).jpg|thumb|[[Baku Crystal Hall]] during the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]]]]

The music scene in Baku can be traced back to ancient times and villages of Baku, generally revered as the fountainhead of [[meykhana]] and [[mugham]] in the Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baki-xeber.com/new/2009/06/22/get=29330 "Meyxana", ya "bədihə" sözü aləmi bir-birinə qatıb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707205524/http://www.baki-xeber.com/new/2009/06/22/get%3D29330 |date=7 July 2011 }} {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-library.musigi-dunya.az/sonoteka/son_garabah_text_az3.html QARABAĞ MUĞAM MƏKTƏBİ] {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{See also|List of universities in Baku}}
Baku hosts many universities, junior colleges and vocational schools. [[Baku State University]], the first established university in Azerbaijan was opened in 1919 by the government of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. In the early years of the Soviet era, Baku already had [[Azerbaijan State Oil Academy]], [[Azerbaijan Medical University]] and [[Azerbaijan State Economic University]]. In the post-WWII period, a few more universities were established such as [[Azerbaijan Technical University]], [[Azerbaijan University of Languages]] and the [[Azerbaijan Architecture and Construction University]]. After 1991 when Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union, the fall of communism led to the development of a number of private institutions, including [[Qafqaz University]] and [[Khazar University]] which are currently considered the most prestigious academic institutions. Apart from the private universities, the government established the [[Academy of Public Administration (Azerbaijan)|Academy of Public Administration]], the [[Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy]] and various military academies. The largest universities according to the student population are Baku State University and Azerbaijan State Economic University. In addition, there are the [[Baku Music Academy]] and the Azerbaijan National Conservatoire in Baku established in the early 1920s. Publicly run kindergartens and elementary schools (years 1 through 11) are operated by local wards or municipal offices.

The [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], the main state research organization in Azerbaijan is locating in Baku as well. Moreover, Baku has numerous libraries, many of which contain vast collections of historic documents from the Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Soviet periods, as well as from other civilisations of the past. The most important libraries in terms of historic document collections include the [[Nizami Museum of Azerbaijan Literature]], the [[National Library of Azerbaijan]], the Mirza Alakbar Central Library, the Samad Vurgun Library and Baku Presidential Library.

The '''Bullet Cluster''' ('''1E 0657-558''') consists of two colliding [[Galaxy cluster|clusters of galaxies]]. Strictly speaking, the name ''Bullet Cluster'' refers to the smaller subcluster, moving away from the larger one. It is at a co-moving radial distance of 1.141 Gpc (3.7 billion light-years).&lt;ref name="NED" /&gt;

Observations of other [[galaxy]] cluster collisions, such as [[MACS J0025.4-1222]], are similarly claimed to support the existence of dark matter.

== Overview ==
The major components of the cluster pair—[[star]]s, [[gas]] and the putative dark matter—behave differently during collision, allowing them to be studied separately.  The stars of the galaxies, observable in visible [[light]], were not greatly affected by the collision, and most passed right through, [[gravity|gravitationally]] slowed but not otherwise altered.  The hot gas of the two colliding components, seen in [[X-ray]]s, represents most of the [[baryon]]ic, i.e. ordinary, matter in the cluster pair. The gases interact electromagnetically, causing the gases of both clusters to slow much more than the stars. The third component, the dark matter, was detected indirectly by the [[gravitational lens]]ing of background objects.  In [[scientific theory|theories]] without dark matter, such as [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics]] (MOND), the lensing would be expected to follow the baryonic matter; i.e. the X-ray gas.  However, the lensing is strongest in two separated regions near (possibly coincident with) the visible galaxies.  This provides support for the idea that most of the mass in the cluster pair is in the form of two regions of dark matter, which bypassed the gas regions during the collision.  This accords with predictions of dark matter as only weakly interacting, other than via the gravitational force.

The Bullet Cluster is one of the [[Temperature|hottest]] known [[galaxy groups and clusters|clusters of galaxies]]. It provides an observable constraint for cosmological models, which may diverge at temperatures beyond their predicted critical cluster temperature.&lt;ref name="Tucker1998" /&gt; Observed from [[Earth]], the subcluster passed through the cluster center 150 [[Mya (unit)|million years ago]], creating a "bow-shaped [[shock wave]] located near the right side of the cluster" formed as "70 million kelvin gas in the sub-cluster plowed through [1 E6 K|100 million ] kelvin gas in the main cluster at a speed of about 6 million miles per hour (nearly 10 million km/h)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2002/0066/ Harvard photo and description]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spaceimages.com/1e065756.html spaceimages.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edpsciences-usa.org/articles/aa/abs/2002/18/aah3368/aah3368.html The dynamical status of the cluster of galaxies 1E0657-56]&lt;/ref&gt; This energy output is equivalent to that of 10 typical quasars.&lt;ref name="Tucker1998" /&gt;

== Significance to dark matter ==

According to Greg Madejski:
{{bquote|Particularly compelling results were inferred from the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] observations of the 'bullet cluster' (1E0657-56; Fig. 2) by Markevitch et al. (2004) and Clowe et al. (2004). Those authors report that the cluster is undergoing a high-velocity (around 4500&amp;nbsp;km/s) merger, evident from the spatial distribution of the hot, [[X-ray]] emitting gas, but this gas lags behind the subcluster galaxies. Furthermore, the dark matter clump, revealed by the weak lensing map, is coincident with the collisionless galaxies, but lies ahead of the collisional gas. This—and other similar observations—allow good limits on the cross-section of the self-interaction of dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = astro-ph/0512012 |bibcode=2005AIPC..801...21M |last1 = Tucker|first1 = W |title=Recent and Future Observations in the X-ray and Gamma-ray Bands: Chandra, Suzaku, GLAST, and NuSTAR |journal= AIP Conference Proceedings |volume = 801|pages = 21–30|last2 = Blanco|first2 = P|last3 = Rappoport|first3 = S|last4 = David|first4 = L|last5 = Fabricant|first5 = D|last6 = Falco|first6 = E.

According to Eric Hayashi:
{{bquote| The [[velocity]] of the bullet subcluster is not exceptionally high for a cluster substructure, and can be accommodated within the currently favoured [[Lambda-CDM model]] [[cosmology]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eric Hayashi |author2=White |doi=10.1111/j.1745-3933.2006.00184.x |journal=Mon.

A 2010 study has concluded that the velocities of the collision as currently measured are "incompatible with the prediction of a LCDM model".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jounghun Lee |author2=Komatsu |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=718|issue=1 |pages=60–65 |title=Bullet Cluster: A Challenge to LCDM Cosmology |date=2010 |arxiv=1003.0939 |bibcode = 2010ApJ...718...60L |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/718/1/60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However subsequent work has found the collision to be consistent with LCDM simulations,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Robert|last2=Davé|first2=Romeel|last3=Nagamine|first3=Kentaro|date=2015-09-01|title=The rise and fall of a challenger: the Bullet Cluster in Lambda cold dark matter simulations|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=452|issue=3|pages=3030–3037|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv1433|issn=0035-8711|arxiv = 1410.7438 |bibcode = 2015MNRAS.452.3030T }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the previous discrepancy stemming from small simulations and the methodology of identifying pairs. Earlier work claiming the Bullet Cluster was inconsistent with standard cosmology was based on an erroneous estimate of the in-fall velocity based on the speed of the shock in the X-ray emitting gas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the Bullet Cluster phenomenon may provide direct evidence for dark matter on large cluster scales, it offers no specific insight into the original [[galaxy rotation problem]].  In fact, the observed ratio of dark matter to visible matter in a typical rich galaxy cluster is much lower than predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/topics/clusters_group/composition.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825170926/http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/topics/clusters_group/composition.html |archivedate=2009-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may indicate that the Lambda-CDM model, the prevailing cosmological model, is insufficient to describe the mass discrepancy on galaxy scales, or that its predictions about the [[shape of the universe]] are incorrect.

== Alternative interpretations ==
[[Mordehai Milgrom]], the original proposer of [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics]], has posted an on-line rebuttal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |first=Moti |last=Milgrom |author-link=Mordehai Milgrom |title=Milgrom's perspective on the Bullet Cluster |url=http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/moti_bullet.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721044735/http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/moti_bullet.html |archive-date=July 21, 2016 |work=The MOND Pages |accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of claims that the Bullet Cluster proves the existence of dark matter. Milgrom claims that MOND correctly accounts for the dynamics of galaxies outside of galaxy clusters, and even in clusters such as the Bullet Cluster it removes the need for most dark matter, leaving only a factor of two which Milgrom expects to be simply unseen ordinary matter ([[Baryonic dark matter|non-luminous baryonic matter]]) rather than [[cold dark matter]]. Without MOND, or some similar theory, the matter discrepancy in galaxy clusters is a factor of 10, i.e. MOND reduces this discrepancy five-fold to a factor of 2. Another study in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=G.W. Angus| author2=B. Famaey| author3=H. Zhao| last-author-amp=yes | title=Can MOND take a bullet?

The '''carat''' ('''ct''') (not to be confused with the [[Fineness#Karat|karat]], sometimes spelled carat, a unit of purity of gold alloys), is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[mass]] equal to 200&amp;nbsp;[[gram|mg]] (0.2 [[gram|g]]; 0.007055 [[ounce|oz]]) and is used for measuring [[gemstone]]s and [[pearl]]s.
The current definition, sometimes known as the '''metric carat''', was adopted in 1907 at the Fourth [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]],&lt;ref name= "Science1908"&gt;{{cite book| title= Science| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=D5YCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=30 June 2012|year=1908|publisher= [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |page= 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon afterwards in many countries around the world.{{efn-lr|The [[United States]] adopted the metric carat definition on July 1, 1913, the [[United Kingdom]] on 1 April 1914.}} The carat is divisible into one hundred ''points'' of two milligrams each. Other subdivisions, and slightly different mass values, have been used in the past in different locations.

In terms of [[diamond]]s, a [[Paragon (diamond)|paragon]] is a flawless stone of at least 100 carats (20&amp;nbsp;g).&lt;ref name=ahdparagon&gt;{{cite book|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|year=2013|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=paragon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
First attested in English in the mid-15th century, the word ''carat'' comes from Italian ''carato'', which comes from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''qīrāṭ'' قيراط, in turn borrowed from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kerátion'' κεράτιον '[[carob]] seed',&lt;ref name=harper&gt;{{OEtymD|carat|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkera%2Ftion |title= κεράτιον| first1= Henry George| last1= Liddell| first2= Robert |last2= Scott| work= A Greek-English Lexicon| via= Perseus.Tufts.edu| publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first= Walter W.| last= Skeat| year= 1888| url= https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00skeauoft | title= carat | work= An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language| publisher= Henry Frowde| place= London| pages= 93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; a diminutive of ''keras'' 'horn'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dke%2Fras |title= κέρας| first1= Henry George| last1= Liddell| first2= Robert |last2= Scott| work= A Greek-English Lexicon| via= Perseus.Tufts.edu| publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a unit of weight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0122990#m_en_gb0122990 |title= carat| work= Oxford Dictionaries| via=oxforddictionaries.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; though unlikely to have been used to measure gold in classical times.&lt;ref name=harper/&gt;

==History==
Carob seeds have been used throughout history to measure jewelry, because it was believed that there was little variance in their mass distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Naturski|first1=Sebastian|title=Carat Weight|url=http://yourdiamondteacher.com/diamond-4cs/carat-weight/|website=Your Diamond Teacher|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was a factual inaccuracy, as their mass varies about as much as seeds of other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Turnbull | first1 = L.

In the past, each country had its own carat. It was often used for weighing [[gold]]. Starting in the 1570s, it was used to measure weights of [[diamond]]s.&lt;ref name=harper/&gt;

===Standardization===
An 'international carat' of 205 milligrams was proposed in 1871 by the Syndical Chamber of Jewellers, etc., in Paris, and accepted in 1877 by the Syndical Chamber of Diamond Merchants in Paris. A metric carat of 200 milligrams – exactly one-fifth of a gram – had often been suggested, and was finally proposed by the International Committee of Weights and Measures, and accepted at the fourth sexennial General Conference of the Metric Convention held in Paris in October 1907. It was soon made compulsory by law in France, but uptake of the new carat was slower in England, where its use was allowed by the [[Weights_and_Measures_Acts_(UK)#19th_century|Weights and Measures (Metric System) Act of 1897]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation-attribution|now=n|{{cite magazine|title=Notes on the weight of the 'Cullinan' diamond|author=Leonard J.

=== UK Board of Trade ===
In the [[United Kingdom]] the original '''[[Board of Trade]] carat''' was exactly {{frac|3|1647|9691}} [[Grain (unit)|grain]]s (~3.170&amp;nbsp;grains = ~205 mg);{{efn-lr|The pre-1888 [[Board of Trade]] carat, of which there were exactly {{frac|151|27|64}} per [[ounce#International troy ounce|ounce troy]], was approximately {{cvt|205.4094|mg}}.}} in 1888, the Board of Trade carat was changed to exactly {{frac|3|17|101}} grains (~3.168&amp;nbsp;grains = ~205 mg).{{efn-lr|The post-1887 Board of Trade carat, of which there were exactly {{frac|151|1|2}}; per ounce troy, was approximately {{cvt|205.3035|mg}}.}} Despite its being a non-metric unit, a number of metric countries have used this unit for its limited range of application.

The Board of Trade carat was divisible into four ''diamond grains'',{{efn-lr|Unlike the modern carat, the Board of Trade carat was not used for measuring pearls; those were measured with ''pearl grains''.}} but measurements were typically made in multiples of {{frac||1|64}} carat.

There were also two varieties of ''refiners' carats'' once used in the United Kingdom — the '''pound carat''' and the '''ounce carat'''.{{efn-lr|The refiners’ carats were the offspring of the [[carat (purity)|carat as a measure of fineness for gold]].}} The [[pound (mass)#Troy pound|pound troy]] was divisible into 24 ''pound carats'' of 240 grains troy each; the pound carat was divisible into four ''pound grains'' of 60 grains troy each; and the pound grain was divisible into four ''pound quarters'' of 15 grains troy each. Likewise, the [[ounce#International troy ounce|ounce troy]] was divisible into 24 ''ounce carats'' of 20 grains troy each; the ounce carat was divisible into four ''ounce grains'' of 5 grains troy each; and the ounce grain was divisible into four ''ounce quarters'' of {{frac|1|1|4}} grains troy each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Chaffers| first= William| |authorlink=William Chaffers| year= 1883| title= Hall Marks on Gold and Silver Plate| edition= 6th| place= [[London]]| publisher= Bickers &amp; Son}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greco-Roman ===
The ''solidus'' was also a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] weight unit. There is literary evidence that the weight of 72&amp;nbsp;coins of the type called ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' was exactly 1 [[Roman pound]], and that the weight of 1&amp;nbsp;''solidus'' was 24&amp;nbsp;''[[siliqua]]e''. The weight of a Roman pound is generally believed to have been 327.45&amp;nbsp;g or possibly up to 5&amp;nbsp;g less. Therefore, the metric equivalent of 1 ''siliqua'' was approximately 189&amp;nbsp;mg. The Greeks had a similar unit of the same value.&lt;ref name="grierson"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/sho/1960/00000003/00000003/art00001 | last=Grierson | first=Philip | title=The Monetary Reforms of 'Abd Al-Malik | journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient | volume=3 | year=1960 | pages=241–264 | doi = 10.1163/156852060X00098 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''China University of Petroleum''' ({{zh|s=中国石油大学|t=中國石油大學|p=Zhōngguó Shíyóu Dàxué}}) is a university in [[China]]. It consists of China University of Petroleum（which located in [[Qingdao]] ) and branch school called China University of Petroleum (Beijing), located in [[Beijing]]. Both are regarded{{whom|date=December 2014}} as the best universities in the field of petroleum related subjects in China. It is placed under the jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]]. It is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The university, founded in 1953, was known then as [[Beijing Petroleum Institute]]. It was founded acquiring the best petroleum associated departments in the country:
* Petroleum research groups in Department of Geology, Department of Mining and Department of Chemical Engineering from [[Tsinghua University]]
* Petroleum research groups in four departments of Peiyang University (now [[Tianjin University]])
* Part of Department of Chemical Engineering from [[Peking University]]

* Some students and faculty from fluid fuel research group in Department of Chemical Engineering from Dalian Institute of Technology (now [[Dalian University of Technology]])
* Some students and faculty in Department of Mining and Department of Chemical Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical Institute (now [[Northwest Polytechnical University]])

It moved to [[Dongying]], [[Shandong]] Province in 1969, with name changed to [[Huadong Petroleum Institute]]. In 1988, it was renamed The University of Petroleum consisting of one part in [[Dongying]] as the college and one in [[Beijing]] as the graduate school. Each gradually developed into universities with both undergraduate and graduate students. In January 2005, its name changed to China University of Petroleum. In 2004, China University of Petroleum (East China) began to move to Qingdao, and completed the relocation in 2012. Dongying campus currently serves as the base for continuing education, remote education, research laboratories, and industry collaboration.

China University of Petroleum specializes in upstream, midstream and downstream petroleum science and engineering, in the overall level of domestic lead. Its five national key specialties are:
* Chemical Engineering and Technology
* Mineral Resources Prospecting and Exploration

'''Coaxial rotors''' or "coax rotors" are a pair of [[helicopter rotor]]s mounted one above the other on concentric shafts, with the same axis of rotation, but turning in opposite directions ([[contra-rotating]]). This configuration is a feature of helicopters produced by the [[Russia]]n [[Kamov]] helicopter [[design bureau]].

== History ==
The idea of coaxial rotors originates with [[Mikhail Lomonosov]]. He had developed a small helicopter model with coaxial rotors in July 1754 and demonstrated it to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Leishman, J. Gordon (2006). Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics. Cambridge University Press. p. 8. {{ISBN|0-521-85860-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, the British Patent Office awarded the first helicopter patent to Henry Bright for his coaxial design. From this point, coaxial helicopters developed into fully operational machines as we know them today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanpoweredhelicopters.org/articles/nasa-tp-3675.pdf NASA Technical Paper 3675] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522075851/http://www.humanpoweredhelicopters.org/articles/nasa-tp-3675.pdf |date=2012-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~leishman/Aero/history.html A History of Helicopter Flight ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713201846/http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~leishman/Aero/history.html |date=2014-07-13 }} , J. Gordon Leishman
Professor of Aerospace Engineering,
University of Maryland, College Park.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two pioneering helicopters, the [[Corradino D'Ascanio#Between the wars|Corradino D'Ascanio]]-built "D'AT3" of 1930, and the generally more successful French mid-1930s ''[[Gyroplane Laboratoire]]'', both used coaxial rotor systems for flight.

== Design considerations ==
[[File:QH-50 DD-692 1967.jpg|thumb|A [[Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH|QH-50]] on board the destroyer USS ''Allen M. Sumner'' (DD-692) during a deployment to Vietnam between April and June 1967]]

Having two coaxial sets of rotors provides symmetry of forces around the central axis for lifting the vehicle and laterally when flying in any direction.  Because of the mechanical complexity, many helicopter designs use alternate configurations to avoid problems that arise when only one rotor is used.  Common alternatives are single-rotor helicopters or [[Tandem rotors|tandem rotor]] arrangements.

=== Torque ===

One of the problems with any single set of rotor blades is the torque (rotational force) exerted on the [[helicopter]] fuselage in the direction opposite to the rotor blades. This torque causes the fuselage to rotate in the direction opposite to the rotor blades. In single rotor helicopters, the antitorque rotor or tail rotor counteracts the main rotor torque and controls the fuselage rotation.

Coaxial rotors solve the problem of main rotor torque by turning each set of rotors in opposite directions. The opposite torques from the rotors cancel each other out.  Rotational maneuvering, [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] control, is accomplished by increasing the collective pitch of one rotor and decreasing the collective pitch on the other.  This causes a controlled dissymmetry of torque.

=== Dissymmetry of lift ===
{{Main|Dissymmetry of lift}}

Dissymmetry of lift is an aerodynamic phenomenon caused by the rotation of a helicopter's rotors in forward flight. Rotor blades provide lift proportional to the amount of air flowing over them. When viewed from above, the rotor blades move in the direction of flight for half of the rotation (advancing half), and then move in the opposite direction for the remainder of the rotation (retreating half). A rotor blade produces more lift in the advancing half. As a blade moves toward the direction of flight, the forward motion of the aircraft increases the speed of the air flowing around the blade until it reaches a maximum when the blade is perpendicular to the [[relative wind]]. At the same time, a rotor blade in the retreating half produces less lift. As a blade moves away from the direction of flight, the speed of the airflow over the rotor blade is reduced by an amount equal to the forward speed of the aircraft, reaching its maximum effect when the rotor blade is again perpendicular to the relative wind. 
Coaxial rotors avoid the effects of dissymmetry of lift through the use of two rotors turning in opposite directions, causing blades to advance on either side at the same time.

=== Other benefits ===
Another benefit arising from a coaxial design includes increased payload for the same engine power; a tail rotor typically wastes some of the available engine power that would be fully devoted to lift and thrust with a coaxial design. Reduced noise is a second advantage of the configuration; some of the loud "slapping" noise associated with conventional helicopters arises from interaction between the airflows from the main and tail rotors, which in some designs can be severe. Also, helicopters using coaxial rotors tend to be more compact (with a smaller footprint on the ground), though at the price of increased height, and consequently have uses in areas where space is at a premium; several Kamov designs are used in [[navy|naval]] roles, being capable of operating from confined spaces on the decks of ships, including ships other than [[aircraft carrier]]s (an example being the [[Kara class cruiser|Kara Class cruisers]] of the Russian navy, which carry a [[Kamov Ka-25|Ka-25]] 'Hormone' helicopter as part of their standard equipment).  Another benefit is increased safety on the ground; the absence of a tail rotor eliminates the major source of injuries and fatalities to ground crews and bystanders.

=== Disadvantages ===
A principal disadvantage of the coaxial rotor design is the increased mechanical complexity of the rotor hub. The linkages and [[Swashplate (helicopter)|swashplates]] for two rotor systems need to be assembled atop the mast, which is more complex because of the need to drive two rotors in opposite directions. Because of the greater number of moving parts and complexity, the coaxial rotor system is more prone to mechanical faults and possible failure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Coaxial helicopters are also more prone to the "whipping" of blades and blade self-collision according to critics.&lt;ref name="BBC crash"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/russia/2013/10/131029_moscow_helicopter_crash.shtml | title=На юго-востоке Москвы разбился новый боевой вертолет | publisher=BBC | accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coaxial models ==

[[File:Axe micro with phone.jpg|thumb|Heli-Max Axe Micro CX, a micro-sized coaxial model helicopter. Note that the tail rotor on this model is angled upwards, giving the operator forward and aft control, rather than countering main rotor torque.]]

The system's inherent stability and quick control response make it suitable for use in small [[radio controlled helicopter]]s. These benefits come at the cost of a limited forward speed, and higher sensitivity to wind. These two factors are especially limiting in outdoor use. Such models are usually fixed-pitch (i.e., the blades cannot be rotated on their axes for different angles of attack), simplifying the model but eliminating the ability to compensate with [[collective pitch|collective]] input. Compensating for even the slightest breeze causes the model to climb rather than to fly forward even with full application of [[Helicopter pilotage#Cyclic|cyclic]].

== Coaxial [[multirotor]]s ==
[[File:OnyxStar HYDRA-12.jpeg|thumb|Coaxial hexacopter - OnyxStar HYDRA-12 from [[AltiGator]]]]
[[Multirotor]] type [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|Unmanned Aerial Vehicles]] exist in numerous configurations including [https://www.research-drone.com/en/DuoCopter.html duocopter], tricopter, [[quadcopter]], hexacopter and octocopter. All of them can be upgraded to coaxial configuration in order to bring more stability and flight time while allowing carrying much more payload without gaining too much weight. Indeed, coaxial [[multirotor]]s are made by having each arm carrying two motors facing in opposite directions (one up and one down). Therefore, it is possible to have an octorotor looking like a quadcopter thanks to coaxial configuration. Special Duocopters are characterised by two motors aligned in a vertical axis. The control is performed by the appropriate acceleration of a single rotor blade for targeted thrust generation during revolution. Having more lifting power for a greater payload explains why coaxial [[multirotor]]s are preferred for all professional commercial application of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coptercraft.com/multirotor-frame-configurations/|title=Multirotor Frame Configurations|work=Coptercraft|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reduced hazards of flight ==
{{Main|Helicopter#Hazards}}

The U.S. Department of Transportation has published a “Basic Helicopter Handbook”.  One of the chapters in it is titled, “Some Hazards of Helicopter Flight'.  Ten hazards have been listed to indicate what a typical single rotor helicopter has to deal with.  The unique coaxial rotor design either reduces or completely eliminates these hazards.  The following list indicates which:

* [[Vortex_ring_state|Settling with power]]&amp;nbsp;— Reduced
* [[Retreating blade stall]] &amp;nbsp;— Reduced
* [[Helicopter#Vibration|Medium frequency vibrations]]&amp;nbsp;— Reduced
* [[Helicopter#Vibration|High frequency vibrations]]&amp;nbsp;— None
* [[Helicopter#Anti-torque|Anti torque system failure in forward flight]]&amp;nbsp;— Eliminated
* [[Helicopter#Anti-torque|Anti torque system failure while hovering]]&amp;nbsp;— Eliminated

The reduction and elimination of these hazards are the strong points for the safety of coaxial rotor design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gyrodynehelicopters.com/coaxial_benefits.htm Coaxial Benefits]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071220021153/http://www.kamov.ru/market/news/petr11.htm Aerodynamic Features of Coaxial Configuration Helicopters]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4950">[[File:DC injection brake.jpg|right|thumb|200px|DC injection brake module]]
'''DC injection braking''' is a method of slowing [[AC motor|AC electric motors]]. A DC voltage is injected into the winding of the AC motor after the AC voltage is disconnected, providing braking force to the rotor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Ralph L. | last=Jaeschke | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1978 | title=Controlling Power Transmission Systems | publisher=Penton/IPC | location=Cleveland, OH |pages=200–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of DC injection braking ==

When power is disconnected from the motor, the rotor spins freely until friction slows it to a stop. Large rotors and loads with a high [[moment of inertia]] may take a significant amount of time to stop through inherent friction alone. To reduce downtime, or possibly as an emergency safety feature, DC injection braking can be used to quickly stop the rotor.

A DC injection brake system can be used as an alternative to a friction brake system. DC injection brakes only require a small module located with the other motor switchgear and/or drivers, mounted in a remote and convenient location, whereas a friction brake must be mounted somewhere on the rotating system. Friction brakes eventually wear out with use and require replacement of braking components. DC brake modules do not have consumable parts and should not require maintenance. Friction brakes also require a method of actuation, requiring either a human operator or system controlled actuator, adding to the complexity of the system. A DC brake is easily integrated into the motor control circuitry.

== Operation ==

[[File:Gleichstrombremse 1.svg|thumb|Half-wave rectification to supply DC current]]
A DC voltage is applied to the motor stator windings, creating a stationary magnetic field which applies a static torque to the rotor. This slows and eventually halts the rotor completely. As long as the DC voltage is applied to the windings, the rotor will be held in position and resistant to any attempt to spin it. The higher the voltage that is applied, the stronger the braking force and holding power. The DC current should only be applied for a few seconds or the motor will overheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parr |first1=E.A. |title=Industrial Control Handbook |date=1998 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |location=Oxford |isbn=9780750639347 |page=351 |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLwtngK3T1UC&amp;pg=PA351 |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In a thyristor-controlled injection braking unit, the DC voltage to be injected into the motor [[Stator|stator]] winding is obtained by [[Rectifier|rectifying]] the supply voltage. Two [[Thyristor|thyristors]] are connected as a phase controlled rectifier (PCR). The braking torque depends on the magnitude of the current, which can be varied by phase control of the thyristors. When the motor is switched off, the motor [[Contactor|contactor]] relay not only disconnects the AC current supply to the motor windings, but also causes a braking relay contactor to close. This initiates a sequence beginning with a time delay of about 300ms that allows voltage still present in the motor windings, caused by residual magnetism ([[Remanence|remanence]]), to diminish to a safe level. Then, the thyristors begin firing to produce the DC braking current. The DC current is set by a timer to continue for a few seconds, and then is switched off. The braking current decays, and after a delay of about 1.5 seconds the braking relay contactor opens again. At this point the motor can be restarted. In such a unit, there are typically two [[Potentiometer|potentiometers]], one to vary the braking torque from the firing circuit and the other to vary the timer. These settings are balanced so that braking torque does not exceed rated motor torque, but also the  braking time must be limited to prevent motor overheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electronic injection brakes: Lektromik® B1 |url=https://www.kimo.de/index.php?file=produkte/bg/b1/pb-LB1-05-10-18.html |publisher=KIMO Industrial Electronics GmbH |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Braking Devices VB 230/400-40 ... 600 Assembly and Commissioning Instructions |publisher=PETER electronic GmbH &amp; Co KG |url=https://www.peter-electronic.com/wp/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/electronic-braking-system-versibrake-40-600a-commissioning-instructions-en.pdf |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great advantage of DEA is that it can be employed not only on a laboratory scale, but also in process.

==Measuring principle==

In a typical test, the sample is placed in contact with two electrodes (the [[Capacitance probe|dielectric sensor]]) and a sinusoidal voltage (the excitation) is applied to one electrode.&lt;ref name="brown2001"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  resulting sinusoidal current (the response) is measured at the second electrode. The response signal is attenuated in amplitude and shifted in phase in relation to the mobility of the ions and alignment of the dipoles. Dipoles in the material will attempt to align with the electric field and ions (present as impurities) will move toward the electrode of opposite polarity. The dielectric properties of [[permittivity]] ε' and loss factor ε" are then calculated from this measured amplitude and phase change.&lt;ref name="brown2001"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15663">'''Dynamical mean-field theory''' ('''DMFT''') is a method to determine the electronic structure of [[strongly correlated materials]]. In such materials, the approximation of independent electrons, which is used in [[density functional theory]] and usual [[band structure]] calculations, breaks down. Dynamical mean-field theory, a non-perturbative treatment of local interactions between electrons, bridges the gap between the [[Nearly free electron model|nearly free electron]] gas limit and the atomic limit of [[condensed-matter physics]].&lt;ref name=Georges&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dynamical mean-field theory of strongly correlated fermion systems and the limit of infinite dimensions |author=A.

&lt;/ref&gt;

DMFT consists in mapping a [[many-body problem|many-body]] lattice problem to a many-body ''local'' problem, called an impurity model.&lt;ref name=Georges_Kotliar&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hubbard model in infinite dimensions |author=A.

The mapping in itself does not constitute an approximation. The only approximation made in ordinary DMFT schemes is to assume the lattice [[self-energy]] to be a momentum-independent (local) quantity. This approximation becomes exact in the limit of lattices with an infinite [[coordination number|coordination]].&lt;ref name=Metzner&gt;{{cite journal |title=Correlated Lattice Fermions in d = ∞ Dimensions |author1=W.

==Relation to mean-field theory==
The DMFT treatment of lattice quantum models is similar to the [[mean-field theory]] (MFT) treatment of classical models such as the [[Ising model]].&lt;ref name=Georges_2&gt;{{cite conference |booktitle=AIP Conference Proceedings |author=Antoine Georges |year=2004 |doi=10.1063/1.1800733 |title=Strongly Correlated Electron Materials: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory and Electronic Structure |volume=715 |pages=3–74 |issue=1 |journal=Lectures on the Physics of Highly Correlated Electron Systems VIII |conference=American Institute of Physics Conference |arxiv=cond-mat/0403123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ising model, the lattice problem is mapped onto an effective single site problem, whose magnetization is to reproduce the lattice magnetization through an effective "mean-field". This condition is called the self-consistency condition. It stipulates that the single-site observables should reproduce the lattice "local" observables by means of an effective field. While the N-site Ising Hamiltonian is hard to solve analytically (to date, analytical solutions exist only for the 1D and 2D case), the single-site problem is easily solved.

Likewise, DMFT maps a lattice problem (''e.g.'' the [[Hubbard model]]) onto a single-site problem. In DMFT, the local observable is the local [[Green's function (many-body theory)|Green's function]]. Thus, the self-consistency condition for DMFT is for the impurity Green's function to reproduce the lattice local Green's function through an effective mean-field which, in DMFT, is the hybridization function &lt;math&gt;\Delta(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; of the impurity model. DMFT owes its name to the fact that the mean-field &lt;math&gt;\Delta(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; is time-dependent, or dynamical. This also points to the major difference between the Ising MFT and DMFT: Ising MFT maps the N-spin problem into a single-site, single-spin problem. DMFT maps the lattice problem onto a single-site problem, but the latter fundamentally remains a N-body problem which captures the temporal fluctuations due to electron-electron correlations.

==Description of DMFT for the Hubbard model==

=== The DMFT mapping===

====Single-orbital Hubbard model====
The Hubbard model &lt;ref name=Hubbard&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Electron Correlations in Narrow Energy Bands|author=John Hubbard |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |pages=238 |volume=276 |year=1963 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1963.0204 |issue=1365|bibcode = 1963RSPSA.276..238H }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the onsite interaction between electrons of opposite spin by a single parameter, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. The Hubbard Hamiltonian may take the following form:
:&lt;math&gt; H_{\text{Hubbard}}=t \sum_{\langle ij \rangle \sigma}  c_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{j\sigma} + U\sum_{i}n_{i \uparrow} n_{i\downarrow}&lt;/math&gt;
where, on suppressing the spin 1/2 indices &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_i^{\dagger},c_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the creation and annihilation operators of an electron on a localized orbital on site &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n_i=c_i^{\dagger}c_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The following assumptions have been made:
* only one orbital contributes to the electronic properties (as might be the case of copper atoms in superconducting [[High-temperature superconductivity#Cuprates|cuprates]], whose &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-bands are non-degenerate),
* the orbitals are so localized that only nearest-neighbor hopping &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is taken into account

====The auxiliary problem: the Anderson impurity model====
The Hubbard model is in general intractable under usual perturbation expansion techniques. DMFT maps this lattice model onto the so-called [[Anderson impurity model]] (AIM). This model describes the interaction of one site (the impurity) with a "bath" of electronic levels (described by the annihilation and creation operators &lt;math&gt;a_{p\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{p\sigma}^{\dagger}&lt;/math&gt;) through a hybridization function. The Anderson model corresponding to our single-site model is a single-orbital Anderson impurity model, whose hamiltonian formulation, on suppressing some spin 1/2 indices &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, is:
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\text{AIM}}=\underbrace{\sum_{p}\epsilon_p a_p^{\dagger}a_p}_{H_{\text{bath}}} + \underbrace{\sum_{p\sigma}\left(V_{p}^{\sigma}c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}a_{p\sigma}+h.c.\right)}_{H_{\text{mix}}}+\underbrace{U n_{\uparrow} n_{\downarrow}-\mu \left(n_{\uparrow}+n_{\downarrow}\right)}_{H_{\text{loc}}}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;H_{\text{bath}} &lt;/math&gt; describes the non-correlated electronic levels &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_p&lt;/math&gt; of the bath
* &lt;math&gt;H_{\text{loc}}&lt;/math&gt; describes the impurity, where two electrons interact with the energetical cost &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; H_{\text{mix}}&lt;/math&gt; describes the hybridization (or coupling) between the impurity and the bath through hybridization terms &lt;math&gt;V_p^{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

The Matsubara Green's function of this model, defined by &lt;math&gt; G_{\text{imp}}(\tau) = - \langle T c(\tau) c^{\dagger}(0)\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, is entirely determined by the parameters &lt;math&gt;U,\mu&lt;/math&gt; and the so-called hybridization function &lt;math&gt; \Delta_\sigma(i\omega_n) = \sum_{p}\frac{|V_p^\sigma|^2}{i\omega_n-\epsilon_p}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the imaginary-time Fourier-transform of &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\sigma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.

This hybridization function describes the dynamics of electrons hopping in and out of the bath. It should reproduce the lattice dynamics such that the impurity Green's function is the same as the local lattice Green's function. It is related to the non-interacting Green's function by the relation:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{G}_0)^{-1}(i\omega_n)=i\omega_n+\mu-\Delta(i\omega_n)&lt;/math&gt; (1)

Solving the Anderson impurity model consists in computing observables such as the interacting Green's function &lt;math&gt;G(i\omega_n)&lt;/math&gt; for a given hybridization function &lt;math&gt;\Delta(i\omega_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; U,\mu&lt;/math&gt;. It is a difficult but not intractable problem. There exists a number of ways to solve the AIM, such as
* The [[Numerical renormalization group]]
* [[Exact diagonalization]]
* [[Iterative perturbation theory]]
* [[Non-crossing approximation]]
* [[Continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo]] algorithms

===Self-consistency equations===
The self-consistency condition requires the impurity Green's function &lt;math&gt;G_\mathrm{imp}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; to coincide with the local lattice Green's function &lt;math&gt;G_{ii}(\tau) = -\langle T c_i(\tau)c_i^{\dagger}(0)\rangle &lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; G_\mathrm{imp}(i\omega_n) = G_{ii}(i\omega_n) = \sum_k \frac {1}{i\omega_n +\mu - \epsilon(k) - \Sigma(k,i\omega_n)}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma(k,i\omega_n)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the lattice self-energy.

===DMFT approximation: locality of the lattice self-energy===
The only DMFT approximations (apart from the approximation that can be made in order to solve the Anderson model) consists in neglecting the spatial fluctuations of the lattice [[self-energy]], by equating it to the impurity self-energy:
:&lt;math&gt; \Sigma(k,i\omega_n) \approx \Sigma_{imp}(i\omega_n) &lt;/math&gt;

This approximation becomes exact in the limit of lattices with infinite coordination, that is when the number of neighbors of each site is infinite. Indeed, one can show that in the diagrammatic expansion of the lattice self-energy, only local diagrams survive when one goes into the infinite coordination limit.

Thus, as in classical mean-field theories, DMFT is supposed to get more accurate as the dimensionality (and thus the number of neighbors) increases. Put differently, for low dimensions, spatial fluctuations will render the DMFT approximation less reliable.

===The DMFT loop===
In order to find the local lattice Green's function, one has to determine the hybridization function such that the corresponding impurity Green's function will coincide with the sought-after local lattice Green's function.
The most widespread way of solving this problem is by using a forward recursion method, namely, for a given &lt;math&gt; U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;:
# Start with a guess for &lt;math&gt;\Sigma(k,i\omega_n)&lt;/math&gt; (typically, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma(k,i\omega_n)=0&lt;/math&gt;)
# Make the DMFT approximation:  &lt;math&gt; \Sigma(k,i\omega_n) \approx \Sigma_\mathrm{imp}(i\omega_n) &lt;/math&gt;
# Compute the local Green's function &lt;math&gt;G_\mathrm{loc}(i\omega_n)&lt;/math&gt;
# Compute the dynamical mean field &lt;math&gt;\Delta(i\omega) = i\omega_n + \mu - G^{-1}_\mathrm{loc}(i\omega_n) - \Sigma_\mathrm{imp}(i\omega_n) &lt;/math&gt;
# Solve the AIM for a new impurity Green's function &lt;math&gt;G_\mathrm{imp}(i\omega_n)&lt;/math&gt;, extract its self-energy: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\mathrm{imp}(i\omega_n) = (\mathcal{G}_0)^{-1}(i\omega_n) - (G_\mathrm{imp})^{-1}(i\omega_n)  &lt;/math&gt;
# Go back to step 2 until convergence, namely when &lt;math&gt;G_\mathrm{imp}^n = G_\mathrm{imp}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
The local lattice Green's function and other impurity observables can be used to calculate a number of physical quantities as a function of correlations &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, bandwidth, filling (chemical potential &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;), and temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;:
* the [[spectral function]] (which gives the band structure)
* the [[kinetic energy]]
* the double occupancy of a site
* [[Linear response|response functions]] (compressibility, optical conductivity, specific heat)

In particular, the drop of the double-occupancy as &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; increases is a signature of the Mott transition.

==Extensions of DMFT==
DMFT has several extensions, extending the above formalism to multi-orbital, multi-site problems.

=== Multi-orbital extension===
DMFT can be extended to Hubbard models with multiple orbitals, namely with electron-electron interactions of the form &lt;math&gt;U_{\alpha \beta} n_{\alpha}n_{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; denote different orbitals. The combination with [[density functional theory]] (DFT+DMFT)&lt;ref name="LDA_DMFT" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Held&gt;{{cite journal |title=Electronic Structure Calculations using Dynamical Mean Field Theory |author=K. Held |journal=[[Adv. Phys.]] |volume=56 |pages=829 |year=2007 |doi=10.1080/00018730701619647|arxiv = cond-mat/0511293| bibcode =  2007AdPhy..56..829H }}&lt;/ref&gt;     then allows for a realistic calculation of correlated materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hauleweb.rutgers.edu/tutorials/|title=Embedded Dynamical Mean Field Theory, an electronic structure package implementing DFT+DMFT|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extended DMFT ===
Extended DMFT yields a local impurity self energy for non-local interactions and hence allows us to apply DMFT for more  general models such as the [[t-J model]].

=== Cluster DMFT ===
In order to improve on the DMFT approximation, the Hubbard model can be mapped on a multi-site impurity (cluster) problem, which allows one to add some spatial dependence to the impurity  self-energy. Clusters contain 4 to 8 sites at low temperature and up to 100 sites at high temperature.

=== Diagrammatic extensions ===
Spatial dependencies of the self energy beyond DMFT, including long-range correlations in the vicinity of a phase transition, can be obtained also through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. The starting point of the dynamical vertex approximation&lt;ref name=Toschi&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dynamical vertex approximation: A step beyond dynamical mean-field theory |author1=A. Toschi |author2=A. Katanin |author3=K.

=== Non-equilibrium ===
DMFT has been employed to study non-equilibrium transport and optical excitations. Here, the reliable calculation of the AIM's [[Keldysh formalism|Green function out of equilibrium]] remains a big challenge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3287">'''Focus on Energy''' is a statewide program in [[Wisconsin]] that offers information, services and financial incentives to help residents and businesses select and install cost-effective solutions that save energy and money.&lt;ref name="Focus on Energy"&gt;[http://www.focusonenergy.com/About-Us/ Focus on Energy Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Focus on Energy was formed in 2001 as Wisconsin’s statewide [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[renewable resource]] initiative. The program’s goals are to work with eligible Wisconsin residents and businesses to help them manage rising energy costs, promote in-state [[economic development]], protect our environment and control the state's growing demand for electricity and natural gas.

Through 2008, Focus on Energy has helped Wisconsin residents and businesses save $239 million and 1,729,990,576 kilowatt hours.&lt;ref name="Office of the Governor"&gt;[http://www.focusonenergy.com/files/Document_Management_System/Marketing/Press_Releases/press061609_239millionsaved.pdf State of Wisconsin: Office of the Governor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally formed by the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] in 1999 and funded by the Utility Public Benefits fund, Focus delivers energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] services for residential, business and renewable customers throughout the state.  In 2001, the Department of Administration rolled out the Focus on Energy Program statewide.  In partnership with consumers, utilities, businesses, [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organizations]] and governmental agencies, the programs help residents and businesses make smart energy choices.  Per the legislation, Focus aims to:
:* Reduce the amount of energy used per unit of production in Wisconsin, while improving energy reliability.
:* Enhance economic development and make Wisconsin firms more competitive.
:* Reduce the [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impacts]] of energy use.
:* Expand the ability of markets to deliver energy efficient and renewable energy [[goods and services]] to consumers and businesses.
:* Deliver quantified financial returns on public investments in energy improvements.

Under [http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lc/publications/im/im_2006_01.pdf 2005 Wisconsin Act 141],&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Legislative Council Information Memorandum"&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lc/publications/im/im_2006_01.pdf Wisconsin Legislative Council Information Memorandum, 2005 Wisconsin Act 141:Energy Efficiency, Renewable Resources, and Energy Policy]&lt;/ref&gt; investor-owned electric and natural-gas utilities are required to spend 1.2 percent of their annual gross operating revenues on energy efficiency programs and renewable resource programs. The Act requires municipal and [[Utility cooperative|electric cooperative]] utilities that choose not to conduct their own programs to contribute revenue to the statewide program (Focus on Energy) created and funded by investor-owned utilities. Municipal and electric cooperative utilities can elect to operate their own Commitment to Community programs.

About 18.4% of [[Angola]] is classified as forest and woodland.  Angola’s large timber resources include the great Maiombe tropical rain forest in [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. In addition, [[eucalyptus]], [[pine]], and [[cypress]] plantations cover 140,000 hectares (346,000 acres). In 2003, roundwood production was estimated at 4,518,000 cu m, and exports amounted to 1,000 cu m.

[[File:Haʻamonga.jpg|thumb|''Haʻamonga ʻa Maui'' with the ''Maka faakinanga'' stone throne visible in the distance]]
[[File:side view of Ha'amonga 'a Maui, Mua, Tonga, c. 1880 to 1889.jpg|thumb|Side view of ''Ha'amonga 'a Maui'', with the lintel visible (Mua, Tonga, c. 1880 to 1889)]]

'''''Ha{{okina}}amonga {{okina}}a Maui''''' (Burden of Maui) is a stone [[trilithon]] located in [[Tonga]], on the north of the island of [[Tongatapu]], near the village of [[Niutoua|Niutōua]], in Heketā.

== History ==
The trilithon is constructed from three coral limestone slabs, and is up to {{convert|5.2|m}} high, 1.4 m wide, and 5.8 m long. The weight of the visible part of each upright stone is approximately 30–40 tons. There are hewn deep mortises in the top of each upright stone to fit in the lintel.

Ha'amonga 'a Maui was either built at the beginning of the 13th century under the 11th [[Tu'i Tonga|Tu{{okina}}i Tonga]] [[Tu'itatui|Tu{{okina}}itātui]] (king strike the knee) and the high chief Loʻau, most likely as a gateway to his royal compound Heketā, or by the deified ancestor Maui in the 6th century, most likely as a astronomical observatory. One can pass through the portal and walk the short distance{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2017}} towards the {{okina}}esi maka faakinanga (stone to lean against), which served as the king's throne. Sitting with his back to that stone, he was safe from assassins from behind, and with his long stick he could hit every potential foe from the front on his knees.

In Tongan tradition the Ha{{okina}}amonga is also believed to have been made by the god [[Māui (mythology)|Maui]], as the stones would be too huge for mortals to handle. The word ''ha{{okina}}amonga'' means "a stick with loads on both ends, carried over the shoulder". Maui was supposed to have the stones obtained from {{okina}}Uvea ([[Wallis Island]]) and carried on to Tonga in a giant canoe. 

The resemblance of the trilithon with [[Stonehenge]] is often quoted,{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} but Stonehenge has many more pillars and the lintels are on top of the sarsens, and not sunken down in a slit. Stonehenge may have been an archaeoastronomical observatory, as claimed by [[Gerald Hawkins]] in 1963. Nevertheless, this was enough for the king of Tonga [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV|Tāufa{{okina}}āhau Tupou IV]] to come in 1967 with the theory that the Ha{{okina}}amonga had an astronomical significance too, telling the position of sunrise at [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es. This theory is supported by the research of Tongan historian Tevita Fale. &lt;ref&gt;Fale, Tevita H. 1990. Tongan Astronomy. Nuku‘alofa, Tonga: Polynesian Eyes Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tevita Fale, there is a V-shaped mark on top of the lintel that aligns with the rising of the sun during the solstices and equinoxes. &lt;ref&gt;Fale, Tevita H. 1990. Tongan Astronomy. Nuku‘alofa, Tonga: Polynesian Eyes Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Maka faakinanga.jpg|thumb|''Maka faakinanga'' stone throne]]
Kik Velt disagrees with the findings of the king [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV|Tāufa{{okina}}āhau Tupou IV]] and Tevita Fale. Velt argues that the V on top is an arrow directed along the main axis of the lintel (about ESE, 117°5 E of N), only 10&amp;nbsp;cm long, too short to be a reliable indicator of any  direction.

Plastics Division headquartered in [[Macedon, New York]],{{When|date=August 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, was acquired by [[Tenneco|Tenneco Packaging]] in 1995 with a $1.27 billion purchase of Mobil's 4,100-employee plastics division,&lt;ref name=Tenneco&gt;{{cite news|last=Bukro|first=Casey|title=Plastics Purchase Wraps Up: Packaging Corp.

Hefty products have been owned or licensed by [[Reynolds Group Holdings#Consumer products|Reynolds Consumer Products, Inc]], headquartered in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]] since Pactiv was acquired by Reynolds' parent company, Reynolds Group Holdings, on November 16, 2010.&lt;ref name="Reynolds acquisition"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds Group Holdings Limited|title=Reynolds Group Holdings Limited Releases Preliminary 2011 Base Earnings Results|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120209005554/en/Reynolds-Group-Holdings-Limited-Releases-Preliminary-2011|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=22 July 2013|archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:aCCRCX11nJ8J:www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120209005554/en/Reynolds-Group-Holdings-Limited-Releases-Preliminary-2011&amp;strip=1|archivedate=Jul 10, 2013|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hefty&gt;{{cite web|title=Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.-About |url=http://reynoldsconsumerproducts.com/pages/About.aspx |publisher=Reynolds Consumer Products Inc. |accessdate=3 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109093512/http://reynoldsconsumerproducts.com/Pages/About.aspx |archivedate=9 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OneZip===
The Hefty OneZip sliding tab sealable bag, formally known as the "rolling-action zipper profile and slipper", was created by Mobil in the early 1990s at a cost of $25 to $50 million, after having developed and evaluated various different [[zipper]] designs, and finally deciding to roll out the "boxcar-shaped version", which slides over dual plastic tracks.&lt;ref name=OneZip&gt;{{cite web|last=Starkman|first=Dean|title=Hefty's zipper bag is giving rivals an uncomfortable zap Reason it's a hit?

===Environmental concerns===
Hefty was one of the brands (along with Kordite and Baggies (another Pactiv brand)) named in a complaint brought against Mobil by the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] in 1992, regarding claims made by the company in advertisements and packaging, which allegedly led consumers to believe that the bags were more [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] than other brands of bag, despite a lack of evidence to support this claim nor presentation of a specific definition for the term.  The FTC dropped their complaint after Mobil agreed to cease making such claims.&lt;ref name=Degradability&gt;{{cite web|last=Pham|first=Alex|title=Mobil in FTC Pact to Drop Claims of Plastic Degradability|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1017531.html|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=22 July 2013|date=28 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FTC Decision"&gt;{{cite web|last=Federal Trade Commission|title=Complaint IN THE MATTER OF MOBIL OIL CORPORATION|url=http://ftc.gov/os/decisions/docs/vol116/FTC_VOLUME_DECISION_116_%28JANUARY_-_DECEMBER_1993PAGES_113-205.pdf|website=Docket C-3415.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9749">A '''hydrogen molecular ion cluster''' or '''hydrogen cluster ion''' is a positively charged cluster of hydrogen molecules. The [[hydrogen molecular ion]] ({{chem|H|2|+}}) and [[trihydrogen ion]] ({{chem|H|3|+}}) are well defined molecular species. However hydrogen also forms singly charged clusters ({{chem|H|''n''|+}}) with ''n'' up to 120.

==Experiments==
Hydrogen ion clusters can be formed in liquid helium or with lesser cluster size in pure hydrogen. {{chem|H|6|+}} is far more common than higher even numbered clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sattler|first=Klaus D.|title=Clusters and Fullerenes|series=Handbook of Nanophysics|year=2010|publisher=CRC Press|pages=20–15–20–17|chapter=Electron Impact Ionization of Hydrogen Clusters Embedded in Helium|isbn=1-4200-7554-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{chem|H|6|+}} is stable in [[solid hydrogen]]. The positive charge is balanced by a solvated electron. It is formed when ionizing radiation impinges on [[solid hydrogen]], and so is formed in radioactive solid [[tritium]]. In natural hydrogen treated with radiation, the positive charge transfers to HD molecules, in preference to {{chem|H|2}}, with the ultimate most stable arrangement being HD(HD)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1105.1861 |title=Interstellar Solid Hydrogen |date=6 May 2011|author1=Ching Yeh Lin |author2=Andrew T.B.

Clampitt and Gowland found clusters with an odd number of hydrogen atoms {{chem|H|3+2''n''|+}}&lt;ref name="clampit"&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 1969|title=Clustering of Cold Hydrogen Gas on Protons |journal=Nature |volume=223 |issue=5208|pages=815–816|doi=10.1038/223815a0|author=R. Clampitt, L. Gowland|last2=Gowland|first2=L.|bibcode = 1969Natur.223..815C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later showed that {{chem|H|15|+}} was relatively stable. {{chem|H|3|+}} formed the core of this cluster with six {{chem|H|2}} molecules surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=11 April 1970|title=Ion Clusters|journal=Nature|volume=226|pages=141–142|doi=10.1038/226141a0|author1=R. Clampitt |author2=D. K. Jefferies |issue=5241|pmid=16057136|bibcode = 1970Natur.226..141C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hiroka studied the stability of the odd numbered clusters in gas up to {{chem|H|21|+}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hiroka|first=K.|year=1987|title=A determination of the stabilities of {{chem|H|3|+|(H|2|)|''n''}} with ''n''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;1−9 from measurements of the gas-phase ion equilibria {{chem|H|3|+|(H|2|)|''n''−1}}+{{chem|H|2}} {{=}} {{chem|H|3|+|(H|2|)|''n''}}|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|publisher=American Institute of Physics |volume=87 |issue=7 |pages=4048–4055|issn=0021-9606|doi=10.1063/1.452909|bibcode = 1987JChPh..87.4048H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bae determined that {{chem|H|15|+}} was especially stable amongst the odd numbered clusters.&lt;ref name=Bae/&gt;

Kirchner discovered even numbered atomic clusters in gas at lower concentrations than the odd numbered atom clusters. {{chem|H|6|+}} was twenty times less abundant than {{chem|H|5|+}}. {{chem|H|4|+}}, {{chem|H|8|+}} and {{chem|H|10|+}} were detected at lesser amounts than {{chem|H|6|+}}.&lt;ref name="Kirchner1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirchner|first=Nicholas J.|author2=Michael T.

Kurosaki and Takayanagi showed that {{chem|H|6|+}} is much more stable than other even clusters and showed [[antiprismatic symmetry]] of order 4 ({{chem|D|2d}} [[molecular symmetry]]).&lt;ref name=Kurosaki&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kurosaki|first=Yuzuru|author2=Toshiyuki.

Negative hydrogen clusters have not been found to exist. {{chem|H|3|−}} is theoretically unstable, but {{chem|D|3|−}} in theory is bound at 0.003&amp;nbsp;eV.&lt;ref name="Bae"/&gt;

==Decay==
{{chem|H|6|+}} in the free gas state decays by giving off H atoms and {{chem|H|2}} molecules. Different energies of decay occur with levels averaging at 0.038&amp;nbsp;eV and peaking at 0.14&amp;nbsp;eV.&lt;ref name="Kirchner1987"/&gt;

==Formation==
Hydrogen molecular ion clusters can be formed through different kinds of ionizing radiation. High energy electrons capable of ionizing the material can perform this task. When hydrogen dissolved in liquid helium is irradiated with electrons their energy must be sufficient to ionize helium to produce significant hydrogen clusters. Irradiation of solid hydrogen by gamma rays or X-rays also produces {{chem|H|6|+}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title={{chem|H|6|+}} in irradiated solid para-hydrogen and its decay dynamics: reinvestigation of quartet electron paramagnetic resonance lines assigned to {{chem|H|2|−}}|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=7|issue=5|pages=776–784|issn=1463-9076|author1=Takayuki Kumada |author2=Hiroto Tachikawa |author3=Toshiyuki Takayanagi |doi=10.1039/b415179h|pmid=19791361|bibcode = 2005PCCP....7..776K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive ion clusters are also formed when compressed hydrogen expands though a nozzle.&lt;ref name="Ekinci"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekinci|first=Y|author2=E. L. Knuth |author3=J. P. Toennies |date=5 October 2006|title=A mass and time-of-flight spectroscopy study of the formation of clusters in free-jet expansions of normal {{chem|D|2}}|journal=Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=125|issue=13|pages=133409–133420|doi=10.1063/1.2217942|pmid=17029483|bibcode = 2006JChPh.125m3409E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchner's theory for the formation of even numbered clusters was that neutral {{chem|H|3}} molecules reacted with the {{chem|H|3|+}} ion (or other odd clusters) to make {{chem|H|6|+}}.&lt;ref name="Kirchner1987"/&gt;

==Properties==
Solvation of {{chem|H|6|+}} in solid hydrogen had little effect on its spectrum.&lt;ref name=Kurosaki/&gt;

==Use==
SRI International studied solid ionic hydrogen fuel. They believed that a solid containing {{chem|H|3|+}} and [[hydrogen anion|H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions could be manufactured. If it could be made it would have a higher energy than other rocket fuels &lt;!--with a [[specific impulse]] of 600 s
 Specific impulse has the dimension of velocity, not time. Probably, a factor of [[standard gravity]] should be used? Restore after fixing.

The '''Hypercar''' is a  design [[concept car]] developed by energy analyst [[Amory Lovins]] at the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]].  This vehicle would have ultra-light construction with an [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] body using advanced [[composite material]]s, low-[[drag coefficient|drag]] design, and [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid drive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmi.org/images/PDFs/Transportation/T04-01_HypercarH2AutoTrans.pdf Hypercars, hydrogen, and the automotive transition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704183949/http://www.rmi.org/images/PDFs/Transportation/T04-01_HypercarH2AutoTrans.pdf |date=2013-07-04 }} ''International Journal of Vehicle Design'', Vol. 35, Nos. 1/2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Designers of the Hypercar claim that it would achieve a three- to five-fold improvement in [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], equal or better performance, safety, amenity, and{{what|date=September 2018}}, compared with today's [[automobile|cars]].&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1994, the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) founded the Hypercar Center to help prove its technical feasibility and commercial reality. The concept was placed in the public domain to maximize competition in capturing its market and manufacturing advantages. The "Hypercar" would be a "hybrid electric/hydrogen-fuelled family vehicle that had only a few parts, was made of lightweight carbon but was stronger than steel, used existing technologies, weighed half a normal car of its size, and could travel the equivalent of 300 miles to the gallon. It was designed to have next to no emissions and, using its batteries, could become a power plant on wheels when parked, eliminating the need for nuclear or coal-power stations".&lt;ref name="John Vidal"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/17/amory-lovins-renewable-energy |title= Amory Lovins: energy visionary sees renewables revolution in full swing |author=John Vidal |date=18 February 2014  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, RMI took this process a step further by launching a for-profit venture, Hypercar Inc. This independent company, in which RMI has a minority interest, is now taking the lead in advancing key areas of Hypercar research and development.&lt;ref name=hyper&gt;[http://www.hypercar.com/ What is a Hypercar Vehicle?] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021129183918/http%3A//www.hypercar.com/ |date=2002-11-29 }} from Hypercar.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Hypercar Inc. changed its name to [[Fiberforge]] to better reflect the company's new goal of lowering the cost of high-volume advanced-composite structures by leveraging the patents of David F. Taggart, one of the founders of Hypercar, Inc.&lt;ref name=hyper/&gt;

Lovins says the commercialisation of the Hypercar began in 2014, with the production of the all-carbon electric [[BMW i3]] family and the 313 miles per gallon [[Volkswagen XL1]].&lt;ref name="John Vidal"/&gt;

'''Lake Sünnet Nature Park''' ({{lang-tr|Sünnet Gölü Tabiat Parkı}}) is a [[List of nature parks of Turkey|nature park]] declared protected area at Lake Sünnet in [[Bolu Province]], northwestern Turkey.

[[Adolf Hitler]] kept his dogs here during [[WWII]] Lake Sünnet is located about {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Göynük]] and {{convert|105|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Bolu]] 
in Bolu Province. It was [[Lake#Landslide and ice-dam lakes|formed by landslide]] in a narrow and deep valley between Kurudağ and Erenler Hill. The lake covers an area of {{convert|18|ha|abbr=on}} at {{convert|820|m|ft|abbr=on}} high above mean sea level.&lt;ref name="gb"/&gt; Its depth reaches up to {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The lake is fed by creeks and springs around.&lt;ref name="tkp"/&gt; 

A {{convert|80|ha|abbr=on}}-area at the lake was registered as  A-grade Forest Recreational Area in 1973. On July 11, 2011, the area was declared a [[nature park]] by the [[Ministry of Environment and Forest (Turkey)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]].&lt;ref name="b9"/&gt;

The nature park offers outdoor recreational activities like hiking, biking and picnicking.&lt;ref name="tkp"/&gt;

A hotel with 45 rooms and 115 beds,&lt;ref name="tkp"/&gt; a restaurant, an outdoor coffeehouse and a sport court are available at the nature park.&lt;ref name="b9"/&gt;

A '''lifting hook''' is a device for grabbing and lifting loads by means of a device such as a [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] or [[crane (machine)|crane]]. A lifting hook is usually equipped with a safety latch to prevent the disengagement of the lifting wire rope sling, chain or rope to which the load is attached.

A hook may have one or more built-in [[pulley]] sheaves as a [[block and tackle]] to multiply the lifting force.

The '''Long Term Ecological Research Network''' '''(LTER)''' consists of a group of over 1800 scientists and students studying [[ecology|ecological processes]] over extended temporal and spatial scales. Twenty-six LTER sites cover a diverse set of [[ecosystem]]s. It is part of the [[International Long Term Ecological Research Network|'''International''' '''Long Term Ecological Research Network''']] '''(ILTER)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilter.network/|title=Home Page {{!}} ILTER|website=www.ilter.network|language=en|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''.'''

==LTER sites==
There are 28 sites within the LTER Network across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Antarctica, each conducting research on different ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lternet.edu/site/|title=US Long Term Ecological Research Network - Sites |work=US Long Term Ecological Research Network|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
LTER sites are both physical places and communities of researchers. Some of the physical places are remote or protected from development, others are deliberately located in cities or agricultural areas. Either way, the program of research for each LTER is tailored to the most pressing and promising questions for that location and the program of research determines the group of researchers with the skills and interests to pursue those questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lternet.edu/how-we-work/|title=US Long Term Ecological Research Network - How We Work |work=US Long Term Ecological Research Network|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While each LTER site has a unique situation—with different organizational partners and different scientific challenges—the members of the Network apply several common approaches to understanding long-term ecological phenomena. These include observation, large-scale experiments, modeling, synthesis science and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lternet.edu/how-we-work/|title=US Long Term Ecological Research Network - How We Work |work=US Long Term Ecological Research Network|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Note 1'': Macro-emulsions comprise large droplets and thus are "unstable" in the sense that the droplets sediment or float, depending on the densities of the dispersed phase and dispersion medium. Separation of the dispersed and ''continuous phases'' usually occurs within time periods from a few seconds to a few hours, depending upon the viscosity of the fluid medium and the size and density of the droplets.

''Note 2'': Macro-emulsions usually contain low-molecular-weight or polymeric surfactants that decrease the rates of coalescence of dispersed droplets. Droplets of the dispersed phase may be also stabilized by adsorption of solid particles onto their surface (so-called Pickering stabilization).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Terminology of polymers and polymerization processes in dispersed systems (IUPAC Recommendations 2011)|journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|year=2011|volume=83|issue=12|pages=2229–2259|doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-06-03|url=http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/2011/pdf/8312x2229.pdf | last1 = Slomkowski | first1 = Stanislaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Macroemulsions can be divided into two main categories based on if they are a single [[emulsion]] or a double or multiple [[emulsion]] group. Both categories will be described using a typical oil (O) and water (W) [[immiscible]] fluid pairing. Single [[emulsions]] can be sub divided into two different types. For each single [[emulsion]] a single [[surfactant]] stabilizing layer exists as a [[buffer zone|buffer]] in between the two layers.  In (O/W) oil droplets are dispersed in water. On the other hand (W/O) involves water droplets finely dispersed in oil. Double or multiple [[emulsion]] classification is similar to single emulsion classification, except the [[immiscible]] phases are separated by at least two surfactant thin films. In a (W/O/W) combination, an [[immiscible]] oil phase exists between two separate water phases. In contrast, in an (O/W/O) combination the [[immiscible]] water phase separates two different oil phases.&lt;ref name="classification" /&gt; 
[[File:Macroemulsion.png|thumb|Image A is (O/W) emulsion. Image B is a (W/O) emulsion. Image C is a W/O/W multiple emulsion group. Image D is a (O/W/O) multiple emulsion group.]]

== Formation ==
Macroemulsions are formed in a variety of ways.  Since they are not [[thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] stable, they do not form spontaneously and require energy input, usually in the form of stirring or shaking of some kind to mechanically mix the otherwise [[immiscible]] [[Phase (matter)|Phases]].  The resulting size of the macroemulsions typically depend on how much energy was used to mix the phases, with higher-energy mixing methods resulting in smaller emulsion particles.  The energy required for this can be approximated using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; \Delta G_{\rm em} = 3{\gamma V\over\ R_{\rm f}} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stokes|first=Robert|title=Fundamentals of Interfacial Engineering|year=1997W|publisher=VCH|isbn=978-0471-18647-2|pages=245–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \Delta G_{\rm em} &lt;/math&gt; is the Energy Input, &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is the interfacial tension between the two phases, &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; is the total volume of the mixture, and &lt;math&gt; R_{\rm f} &lt;/math&gt; is the average radius of the newly created emulsions

This equation gives the energy requirement just to separate the particles.  In practice the energy cost is much higher, as most of the mechanical energy is simply converted to [[heat]] rather than mixing the phases.

There are other ways to create emulsions between two liquids, such as adding one phase with droplets already being the required size.

An [[emulsifying agent]] of some sort is also generally required.  This helps form emulsions by reducing the [[interfacial tension]] between the two phases, usually by acting as a [[surfactant]] and [[adsorbtion|adsorbing]] to the interface.  This works because most emulsifiers have a [[hydrophilic]] and [[hydrophobic]] side, which means they can bond with both the oil-like phase and the water-like phase, thus reducing the number of water-oil molecular interactions at the surface.  Reducing the number of these interactions reduces the interfacial energy, thus causing the emulsions to become more stable. Typically, the concentration of [[surfactant]] needed is often at or just above [[critical micelle concentration]] (CMC).&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; This forms a [[surfactant]] monolayer which orients itself to minimize its surface to volume ratio. This ratio yields highly polydisperse spherical droplets in the range of 0.1 to 10 μm.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; The probability (P) of finding a certain sized droplet can be estimated for inner layer drops through the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; \ P = {{\ 1 \over\Delta R \sqrt{ 2 \pi\, } \ } \exp[{  \ ( \ln{R} \ - \ln{\bar{R}} \ )^2 \over\ 2 \Delta R^2 \ \ } \ }] &lt;/math&gt;

where R is the radius of the droplet, &lt;math&gt; \bar{R} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the mean radius, and &lt;math&gt; \Delta R \ &lt;/math&gt; is the standard deviation.

Determining which phase is the continuous phase and which phase is the dispersed phase is done by using the [[Bancroft rule|Bancroft Rule]] when the two phases have similar mole fractions.  This rule states that the phase which the emulsifier is the most [[soluble]] in will be the [[continuous phase]], even if it has a smaller [[volume fraction]] overall.  For example, a mixture that is 60% Water and 40% Oil can form an emulsion where the water is the dispersed phase and the oil is the continuous phase if the emulsifier is more soluble in the oil.  This is because the continuous phase is the phase that can coalesce the fastest upon mixing, which means it is the phase that can [[diffuse]] the emulsifying agent away from its own interfaces and into the [[bulk liquids|bulk]] the fastest.  This rule is not 100% accurate, but is a good rule of thumb for mixtures with similar compositions.  For mixtures with overwhelmingly large amounts of one phase, the largest phase will become the continuous phase.

== Stability ==
Macroemulsions are, by definition, not thermodynamically stable.  This means that from the moment they are created, they are always reverting to their original, immiscible and separate state.  The reason why Macroemulsions can exist however, is because they are kinetically stable rather than thermodynamically stable.  This means that while they are continuously breaking down, it is done at such a slow pace that it is practically stable from a macroscopic perspective.

The reasons why macroemulsions are stable is similar to the reasons why [[colloids]] can be stable.  Based on [[DLVO theory]], repulsive forces from the charged surfaces of the two phases repel each other enough to offset the attractive forces of the [[Hamaker Force Interactions]].  This creates a [[potential well|potential energy well]] at some distance, where the particles are in a local area of stability despite not being directly touching and therefore coalescing.  However, since this is an area of local rather than total low potential, if any set of particles can randomly have enough [[thermal energy]] they can coalesce into an even more stable state, which is why all macroemulsions gradually coalesce over time.

While it is energetically favorable for individual particles to coalesce due to the subsequent reduction of interfacial area, the adsorbed emulsifier prevents this.  This is because it is more favorable for the emulsifying agent to be at an interface so reducing the interfacial area requires expending energy to return the emulsifying agent to the bulk.

Stability of the Macroemulsions are based on numerous environmental factors including [[temperature]], [[pH]], and the [[ionic strength]] of the [[solvent]].

== Progression of macroemulsions ==
[[File:Flocculation4.png|thumb|Flocculation is the accumulation of drops within a continuous liquid phase.]]
[[File:Creaming2.png|thumb|Creaming is the accumulation of drops at the top of a liquid continuous phase.]]
[[File:Coalescence.png|thumb|Coalescence is the merging of two drops into one single drop.]]
[[File:Demulification.png|thumb|Demulsification is when the dispersed phase completely coalesces into one continuous phase.]]

===Flocculation===
Flocculation occurs when the dispersed drops group together throughout the continuous phase, but don't lose their individual identities. The driving force for flocculation is a weak [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]] attraction between drops at large distances, which is known as the secondary energy minimum.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; An electrostatic repulsion between the surfaces prevents the drops from touching and merging, stabilizing the macroemulsion. The rate of diffusion limited encounters is equal to the upper limit for the decrease in droplet concentration and can be represented by the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dc}{dt}=-8\pi\,DRc^2 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

where D can be found using the [[Stokes-Einstein relation]] &lt;math&gt; D=\frac{k_B T}{6\pi\,\eta\,R} &lt;/math&gt;, R is the droplet radius, and c is the number of droplets per unit volume. This equation can be reduced to the following:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dc}{dt}=-k_fc^2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant of flocculation &lt;math&gt;(k_f=\frac{4k_BT}{3\eta\,})&lt;/math&gt;. If the droplet radii are not all the same size and aggregation occurs, the flocculation rate constant is equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{8k_BT}{3\eta\,}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Creaming ===
Creaming is the accumulation of drops in the dispersed phase at the top of the container.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; This occurs as a result of [[buoyancy force]]s. The density of the dispersed and continuous phases, as well as the viscosity of the continuous phase, greatly affect the creaming process. If the dispersed phase liquid is less dense than the continuous phase liquid, creaming is more likely to occur. Also, there is a greater chance of creaming at lower viscosities of the continuous phase liquid. Once all of the dispersed drops are in close proximity to each other, it is easier for them to coalesce.

=== Coalescence ===
Coalescence is the merging of two dispersed drops into one. The surfaces of two drops must be in contact for coalescence to occur. This surface contact is dependent on both the [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]] attraction and surface repulsion forces between two drops.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; Once in contact, the two surface films are able to fuse together, which is more likely to occur in areas where the surface film is weak. The liquid inside each drop is now in direct contact, and the two drops are able to merge into one.

=== Demulsification ===
Demulsification is the act of destabilizing an [[emulsion]]. Once all of the drops have coalesced, two continuous phases exist instead of one dispersed phase and one continuous phase. This process may be accelerated by adding a cosurfactant or salt or by slowly stirring the liquid solution.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; Demulsification is beneficial for several macroemulsion applications.

== Applications ==
Macroemulsions have nearly endless uses in scientific, industrial, and household applications. They are widely utilized today in automotive, beauty, cleaning and fabric care products as well as biotechnology and manufacturing techniques.&lt;ref name=xiameter&gt;{{cite web|title=Silicone Macroemulsions And Microemulsions|url=http://www.xiameter.com|publisher=Dow Corning Corporation|accessdate=30 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macroemulsions are often chosen over [[microemulsions]] for automotive and industrial applications because they are less expensive, easier to dispose of, and their tendency to demulsify more quickly is often desirable for lubricants. Soluble oil lubricants, usually containing fatty oil or mineral oil in water, are ideal for high speed and low pressure applications. They are often used for friction reducing needs and metalworking.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Totten|first=George E.|title=Fuels and Lubricants Handbook: Technology, Properties, Performance, and Testing|year=2003|publisher=ASTM International|location=West Conshohocken, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many skin care products, sun screens, and fabric softeners are made from silicone macroemulsions. Silicone's is chosen because of  its non-irritating and lubricating properties. Different combinations of macroemulsions and surfactants are the subject of a wide range of biological research, especially in the area of cell cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stefan|first=Alessandra|author2=Gerardo Palazzo |author3=Andrea Ceglie |author4=Eleonora Panzavolta |author5=Alejandro Hochkoeppler |title=Water-in-oil Macroemulsions Sustain Long-term Viability of Microbial Cells in Organic Solvents|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|date=3 December 2002|volume=81|issue=3|pages=323–328|doi=10.1002/bit.10476|pmid=12474255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=culture&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cinelli|first=Cuomo G. |author2=Cuomo, F. |author3=Hochkoeppler, A. |author4=Ceglie, A. |author5=Lopez, F|title=Use of Rhodotorula minutaLive Cells Hosted in Water-in-Oil Macroemulsion for Biotrasformation Reaction|journal=Biotechnol Progress|year=2006|volume=22|issue=3 |pages=689–695|doi=10.1021/bp0504039|pmid=16739950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=contamination&gt;{{cite news|last=Georgia Institute Of Technology|title=Unique Two-part Macroemulsion Offers New Approach To Cleaning Up Contaminated Aquifers|newspaper=Science Daily|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohawk Airlines Flight 121''' crashed during [[takeoff]] from [[Greater Rochester International Airport|Rochester-Monroe Airport]] for [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark International Airport]] on July 2, 1963, killing 7 people and injuring 36.

The aircraft, a [[Martin 4-0-4]] with a total of 15,970 hours in-flight, attempted to take-off on runway 28 into a heavy thunderstorm. The pilot was unable to maintain control, and the plane came back down. The left wing impacted ground and the aircraft cartwheeled wing-over-wing and caught fire, killing seven people on board: two crewmembers and five passengers. The weather forecast at the time was found to be entirely accurate. The [[NTSB]] found the cause of the accident to be the pilot's poor decision to take off in bad weather, and cited the weather itself as a contributing factor. The captain had tried to refuse takeoff due to poor weather conditions but was told he would be demoted if he failed to take off as he had refused to take off two times previously due to inclement weather. Two minutes after takeoff strong winds had taken a hold of the aircraft and it preceded to tumble its way back down to the ground. The co-pilot had completely lost control of the aircraft but would not let up on the controls so the pilot took matters back into his own hands and managed to get the plane to a certain position to save most of the passengers on board.

'''Oliver Blackburn Shallenberger''' (May 7, 1860 – January 23, 1898) was an American electrical engineer and inventor. He is associated with electrical inventions related to [[alternating current]]. He is most noted for inventing the first successful alternating current [[electrical meter]], the forerunner of the modern electric meter.  This was critical to general acceptance of AC power.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/64863/ |quote=...the first successful AC ampere-hour meter in 1888. This meter measures the flow of electric current through a circuit. Early meters like this helped companies that supplied electricity to customers monitor usage and charge appropriate rates. Shallenberger's meter also paved the way for the acceptance of AC power distribution. |title=Westinghouse Shallenberger Ampere-hour Meter, 1888–1890 {{ndash}} Object I.D. 29.1333.4 |publisher=[[The Henry Ford]] |accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Shallenberger was born in [[Rochester, Pennsylvania]], on May 7, 1860. His parents were Aaron T. Shallenberger and Mary (Bonbright) Shallenberger.{{sfn|Jordan|1914|p=87}} He attended public schools of Rochester in [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]]. He also went to [[Beaver College]] in Beaver County for a short time. He then attended the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] as a cadet engineer in 1877. [[William Shadrack Shallenberger]], a member of [[United States Congress|Congress]], was his uncle and helped him get into the Academy. He was head of a list of 126 candidates and took special interest in their physics courses. For the first year he was at the top of his class. During the second year in an accident he dislocated his wrist, broke an arm, and suffered vision impairment. He graduated in 1880 and was third of his class. Among the electricians and inventors that attended the Naval Academy around this same time were [[Frank J. Sprague]], Dr. Louis Duncan, W. F. C. Hasson, and Gilbert Wilkes.{{sfn|Jordan|1914|p=87}}{{sfn|Terry|1898|p=577}}

== Mid life and career ==

Shallenberger then served the customary two year commitment serving on a government ship, assigned to the U.S. flagship ''[[USS Lancaster (1858)|Lancaster]]'' in the Mediterranean.  He witnessed the [[Bombardment of Alexandria]].  He returned to the United States in 1883. Shallenberger then joined the Union Switch and Signal Company of [[Pittsburgh]] in 1884 under the management of [[George Westinghouse]]. The company was organizing an electric light department using alternating current and he became their Chief Electrician. He then for the next few years spent his winters in Colorado and his summers in Rochester at a research laboratory of the Westinghouse company. Shallenberger ran the experiments of alternating current apparatus which had been imported from Europe. This research was the foundation for the organization of the Westinghouse Electric Company.  He was appointed chief electrician, which continued at the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. He was elected an associate member of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] in 1888. In 1891, poor health required him to resign from the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse company]] but he continued as a Consulting Electrician.{{sfn|Terry|1898|p=577}}

In 1897 he organized the Colorado Electric Power Company, becoming its President until his death. He settled permanently in Colorado Springs in 1897. Shallenberger was recognized as a worldwide authority on electricity. He was one of the promoters of the Rochester Electric Company.{{sfn|Jordan|1914|p=88}}{{sfn|Terry|1898|p=579}}

== Inventions and innovations ==
Shallenberger did much in electrical experimentation and original research.{{sfn|Electrical World|1898|p=206}} He invented a street-lighting system in which each of a series of incandescent lamps is connected to specially designed transformers so that upon the interruption of the current of any lamp, the normal current is allowed to flow through the corresponding transformer to the remaining lamps without a power surge. It was patent US740189.{{sfn|United States Patent Office|1903|p=80}} The design and construction supervision of these specially designed transformer systems were by him. He also was the first in the United States to innovate a method of connecting alternating current generators in a parallel circuit.{{sfn|Jordan|1915|p=981}}

Shallenherger was the first to demonstrate in the United States, with the assistance of [[George Westinghouse]], the safety of alternating current and he was primarily responsible for the general usage of that type of current over that of direct current. Through his inventions he showed that the use of alternating current electricity was more efficient and safer to use than direct current.{{sfn|Iron Age|1898|p=26}}

Shallenberger, through a research laboratory accident, innovated a device that led to the invention in April 1888 of an [[Electricity meter|induction meter]], a paramount apparatus of the Westinghouse alternating current system.{{sfn|Jordan|1914|p=981}}{{sfn|Terry|1898|p=580}} One day when he was experimenting on a new type of lamp a spring fell off and landed inside the lamp on a small edge of the holding structure. Before it got replaced by a co-worker Shallenberger observed that the spring rotated by some sort of electromagnetic force. He then conceived the idea that perhaps this force field could be used to turn some small wheels in such a way that they could measure electricity.&lt;ref name=AmpHour_Meter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://watthourmeters.com/westinghouse/shall-amp.html |title=Shallenberger Ampere-hour Meter (1888 to 1897)|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website= |publisher=WattHourMeters |access-date=December 13, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One thing led to another and eventually a few weeks later he built the first alternating current measuring meter.{{sfn|Kane|1997|p=218}} He patented it under number US449003 A.{{sfn|United States Patent Office|1903|p=80}} It was a type of motor.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/08/dayintech-0814/ |title=Aug. 14, 1888: I Sing the Meter Electric |last=Alfred |first=Randy |date=July 27, 2010 |work=[[Wired Magazine]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]  |access-date= December 10, 2017 |quote=Shallenberger realized he could use the effect to turn wheels in a meter to measure electrical charge. Not only could he use it, he did ... and built an alternating-current ampere-hour meter in just three weeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shallenberger's meter device was improved to what is today the modern electric meter for recording and indicating watt-hours for the measure of electric energy consumed by a customer. His electric meter was used by the British Government Board of Trade as the primary instrument for the measurement of electric current. His electric meter for measuring alternating current electricity was known worldwide by the end of the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Iron Age|1898|p=26}}

Securing accurate payment for electricity as a commodity had immense practical import.&lt;ref name="Ford" /&gt;{{sfn|Iron Age|1898|p=26}}  Shallenberger's electric meter invention was not the first to address the need for payment for electricity. [[Thomas Edison]] initially invoked a ‘per lamp’ surcharge in 1882.  This gave way to a meter that used electrolytic jars that chemically measured zinc transfers and inferred electric usage. In 1888 [[Elihu Thomson]] patented a [[Walking beam|walking-beam]] meter, disparagingly labeled as a [[Rube Goldberg]]-styled device.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;

Shallenberger's simple [[AC motor]] (as it was later identified by [[Nikola Tesla]]) revolutionized electric meters. It operated on alternating current of 133 cycles per second.{{sfn|Skrabec|2007|p=116}}{{sfn|Seifer|1998|p=92}} It was accurate and an important component of Westinghouse's AC electrical system. The meter sold 120,000 units within ten years. It enabled billing by the [[ampere hour]], combining measures of current and charge. "[[Coulomb|Coulomb motor meters]]" are those that measure electric quantity used. Therefore, power companies that used Shallenberger's meters charged by the energy consumed.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;

== Later life and death ==

In 1889 he visited some major European cities.{{sfn|Jordan|1914|p=88}} Shallenberger died in Colorado on January 23, 1898. He is buried at Beaver County, Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Bausman|1904|p=527}}

== Personal life ==

Shallenberger married Mary Woolslair on November 27, 1889.{{sfn|Jordan|1914|p=89}} They had a son (John W.) and daughter (Gertrude). John W. graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1912.{{sfn|Bausman|1904|p=527}}

[[Image:3 phase AC waveform.svg|thumb|284px|One voltage cycle of a three-phase system]]
A '''polyphase system''' is a means of [[Electric power distribution|distributing]] [[Alternating current|alternating-current]] [[electric power|electrical power]] where the power transfer is constant.  Polyphase systems have three or more energized [[electrical conductor]]s carrying alternating currents with a [[phase (waves)|defined phase angle]] between the voltage waves in each conductor; for three-phase voltage, the phase angle is 120° or ~2.09 radians.  Polyphase systems are particularly useful for transmitting power to [[electric motor]]s which rely on alternating current to rotate. The most common example is the [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase power]] system used for industrial applications and for [[power transmission]].   A major advantage of three phase power transmission (using three conductors, as opposed to a single phase power transmission, which uses two conductors), is that, since the remaining conductors act as the return path for any single conductor, the power transmitted by a balanced three phase system is three times that of a single phase transmission but only one extra conductor is used.  Thus, a 50% / 1.5x increase in the transmission costs achieves a 200% / 3.0x increase in the power transmitted.

AC power generation and distribution in higher phase orders than three is still in the theoretical and modeling stages.  
==Phases==
In the very early days of commercial electric power, some installations used [[Two-phase electric power|two-phase]] four-wire systems for motors. The chief advantage of these was that the winding configuration was the same as for a single-phase capacitor-start motor and, by using a four-wire system, conceptually the phases were independent and easy to analyse with mathematical tools available at the time.

Two-phase systems can also be implemented using three wires (two "hot" plus a common neutral). However this introduces asymmetry; the voltage drop in the neutral makes the phases not exactly 90 degrees apart.

Two-phase systems have been replaced with three-phase systems. A two-phase supply with 90 degrees between phases can be derived from a three-phase system using a [[Scott-T transformer|Scott-connected transformer]].

A polyphase system must provide a defined direction of phase rotation, so mirror image voltages do not count towards the phase order. A 3-wire system with two phase conductors 180 degrees apart is still only single phase. Such systems are sometimes described as [[Split-phase electric power|split-phase]].

==Motors==
[[File:3phase-rmf-noadd-60f-airopt.gif|thumbnail|right|Three-phase electric machine with rotating magnetic fields.]]

Polyphase power is particularly useful in [[Alternating current|AC]] motors, such as the [[induction motor]], where it generates a [[rotating magnetic field]]. When a three-or-more-phase supply completes one full cycle, the magnetic field of a two-poles-per-phase motor has rotated through 360° in physical space; motors with more than two poles per phase require more power supply cycles to complete one physical revolution of the magnetic field and so these motors run slower. Induction motors using a rotating magnetic field were independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] and developed in a three-phase form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=thOPkFjrj5MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+induction+machine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VnjxUfqfKNW-4AOprYGQDw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla&amp;f=false Ion Boldea, Syed Abu Nasar, The Induction Machine Handbook  - CRC Press, 2002, page 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously all commercial motors were DC, with expensive [[commutator (electric)|commutators]], high-maintenance brushes and characteristics unsuitable for operation on an alternating current network. Polyphase motors are simple to construct, are self-starting and have little vibration compared with single-phase motors.

==Higher phase order==
Once polyphase power is available, it may be converted to any desired number of phases with a suitable arrangement of transformers.  Thus, the need for more than three phases is unusual, but higher phase numbers than three have been used.

Between 1992 and 1995, New York State Electric &amp; Gas operated a 1.5Mi. converted double-circuit 3-phase 115KV transmission line as a 93KV 6-phase transmission line.  The primary result was that it is economically favorable to operate an existing double-circuit 115KV 3-phase line as a 6-phase line for distances greater than 23-28 miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Phase Order Transmission Demonstration|url=http://www.cerc-reactors.com/articles/miso16sep2004seminar/6-PhaseOTLs/eseerco.pdf|website=CERC-Reactors.com|publisher=NY State Electric &amp; Gas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-phase power generation designs with 5, 7, 9, 12, and 15 phases in conjunction with multi-phase [[induction generator]]s (MPIGs) driven by wind turbines
have been proposed.  An induction generator produces electrical power when its rotor is turned faster than the ''[[synchronous speed]]''.  A multi-phase induction generator has more poles, and therefore a lower synchronous speed.  Since the rotation speed of a wind turbine may be too slow for a substantial portion of its operation to generate single-phase or even three-phase AC power, higher phase orders allow the system to capture a larger portion of the rotational energy as electric power.

High-phase-order (HPO) power transmission has been frequently proposed as a way to increase transmission capacity within a limited-width [[right of way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://tdworld.com/overhead-transmission/high-phase-what |title=High-Phase What? |date=July 1, 2011 |first=Vito |last=Longo |journal=Transmission &amp;amp; Distribution World}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The required conductor spacing is determined by the phase-to-phase voltages, and six-phase power has the same voltage between adjacent phases as between phase and neutral.  Three-phase power has phase-to-phase voltages equal to {{sqrt|3}} = 1.732 times the phase-to-neutral voltage.  This lets an existing [[double-circuit transmission line]] carry more power with minimal change to the existing cable plant.  This is particularly economical when the alternative is upgrading an existing [[extra high voltage]] (EHV, more than 345&amp;nbsp;kV phase-to-phase) transmission line to ultra-high voltage (UHV, more than 800&amp;nbsp;kV) standards.&lt;!--A number of promising references can be found by web searching for "high phase order power transmission", all locked up behind the IEEE paywall--&gt;

A '''slipstream''' is a region behind a moving object in which a [[wake]] of [[fluid]] (typically air or water) is moving at [[velocities]] comparable to the moving object, relative to the ambient fluid through which the object is moving.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UzJqTX4LPOsC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415&amp;dq=slipstream+aerodynamics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wID5sVpbHa&amp;sig=6e6lmtfdfooerHyM_d4KLLQRp64&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XsBGSuOqL5WENrrysb4E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 Recent studies of Train Slipstreams by Johnson, Dalley, and Temple]&lt;/ref&gt; The term slipstream also applies to the similar region adjacent to an object with a fluid moving around it. "Slipstreaming" or "[[drafting (racing)|drafting]]" works because of the relative motion of the fluid in the slipstream.

==Overview==
A slipstream created by [[turbulent flow]] has a slightly lower pressure than the ambient fluid around the object. When the flow is [[laminar flow|laminar]], the pressure behind the object is higher than the surrounding fluid.

The shape of an object determines how strong the effect is. In general, the more [[aerodynamic]] an object is, the smaller and weaker its slipstream will be. For example, a box-like front (relative to the object's motion) will collide with the medium's particles at a high rate, transferring more momentum from the object to the fluid than a more aerodynamic object. A bullet-like profile will cause less [[turbulence]] and create a more [[laminar flow]].

A tapered rear will permit the particles of the medium to rejoin more easily and quickly than a truncated rear. This reduces lower-pressure effect in the slipstream, but also increases [[skin friction]] (in engineering designs, these effects must be balanced).

==Slipstreaming==
{{refimprove|date=June 2011}}
The term "slipstreaming" describes an object travelling inside the slipstream of another object (most often objects moving through the air though not necessarily flying).  If an object is following another object, moving at the same speed, the rear object will require less power to maintain its speed than if it were moving independently.  This technique, also called [[Drafting (aerodynamics)|Drafting]] can be used by bicyclists.
*Following in the slipstream of another motor vehicle, or "drafting", allows for significantly improved fuel efficiency due to reduced atmospheric [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. [[Truck]] convoys are a common example, travelling highways in a single-file queue several vehicles long. In tests, this has been shown to produce significant fuel savings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ika.rwth-aachen.de/pdf_eb/gb6-24e_konvoi.pdf Konvoi – Development and examination of the application of electronically coupled truck convoys on highways Aachen University study 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414031219/http://www.ika.rwth-aachen.de/pdf_eb/gb6-24e_konvoi.pdf |date=2014-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auto racing]] drivers also draft in order to conserve fuel, the better to gain competitive advantage by reducing the frequency of fuel stops or, more often, to reach a higher speed before pulling out to attempt to overtake another driver.
*A related effect used for [[Lift (force)|lift]] rather than drag reduction is [[vortex surfing]] for airborne objects.  The extended formations ([[V formation]]) or "[[wikt:skein|skeins]]" in which many [[bird migration|migratory]] birds (especially [[goose|geese]]) fly enable the birds (except, of course, the [[bird]] at the front) to use vortex surfing to take advantage of one another's [[vortex|vortices]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA401264 Drag Reduction from Formation Flight. Flying Aircraft in Bird-Like Formations Could Significantly Increase Range]; Defense Technical Information Center; April 2002; Retrieved February 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other birds (for example [[cormorant]]s) that typically fly in close formation, even on short journeys, are probably also exploiting this effect. Using [[wingtip devices]] to reduce [[induced drag]] caused by [[wingtip vortices]] has been tested for aircraft, and could save 10%–29% fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2003/03-42.html/ NASA SKY SURFING FOR FUEL ECONOMY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418012236/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2003/03-42.html |date=2011-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooney, Michael (October 11, 2012).

==Spiral slipstream==
'''Spiral slipstream''' (also known as ''spiraling slipstream'', '''propwash''' in the US, or just ''slipstream'' in the UK{{citation needed | reason=Only heard it called propwash in the UK|date=August 2015}}) is a [[spiral]]-shaped slipstream formed behind a rotating [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] on an [[aircraft]]. The most noticeable effect resulting from the formation of a spiral slipstream is the tendency to [[Roll, pitch, and yaw|yaw]] nose-left at low speed and full [[throttle]] (in centerline [[Tractor configuration|tractor]] aircraft with a clockwise-rotating propeller.) This effect is caused by the slipstream acting upon the tail [[vertical stabilizer|fin]] of the aircraft: the slipstream causes the air to rotate around the forward-[[aft]] axis of the aircraft, and this air flow exerts a force on the tail fin, pushing it to the right. To counteract this, some aircraft have the front of the fin (vertical stabilizer) slightly offset from the centreline so as to provide an opposing force that cancels out the one produced by the slipstream, albeit only at one particular (usually cruising) speed, an example being the [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighter from [[World War II]].

This extension was not always used, depending on the supply and demand for lumber. The boom was constructed by creating a series of man-made islands known as "cribs". These cribs built of local mountain stone and sunken timber were stretched diagonally across the river, beginning on the south side near Duboistown and ending on the north side near Linden. The boom was made of 352 separate cribs that were {{convert|22|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name="hiawatha"/&gt; The boom was opened and closed at the upper end by a device known as a "sheer boom." It was {{convert|1000|ft|m}} long and was controlled with a hand-powered [[windlass]]. The sheer boom gathered the logs into the main boom that was capable of holding up to 300 million board feet (700 million m³) of logs. The lower end of the boom was where the logs were sorted. The mills in Williamsport, [[South Williamsport, Pennsylvania|South Williamsport]], and Duboistown each had their own distinctive brand burnt or cut into the logs. The men working at the end of the boom would sort the logs according to their corresponding brand and float them into the correct holding pond along the bank of the river. During the height of the lumber industry in Lycoming County, 1861–91, the various mills produced 5.5 billion board feet (13 million m³) of lumber. Williamsport became one of the most prosperous cities in Pennsylvania and in the United States. Men like James H. Perkins, [[Peter Herdic]], and Mahlon Fisher became [[millionaire]]s while many of the men who actually worked in the river struggled to survive on the wages paid to them by the [[lumber baron]]s.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite book

==Beginnings==
The first European settlers arrived in what became Lycoming County after the [[Province of Pennsylvania]] purchased the land from the [[Iroquois]] in the 1768 [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]]. Small scale sawmills along tributaries of the West Branch Susquehanna River were built prior to the [[American Revolution]], and provided enough lumber to build the houses and barns of Williamsport and the surrounding area. Even more timber was made into rafts and floated all the way down the [[Susquehanna River]], into [[Chesapeake Bay]] and on to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], where the massive and straight timbers were turned into masts for the famous [[Baltimore Clipper]]s and other sailing vessels of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seasons"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Owlett | first = Steven E. | title = Seasons Along The Tiadaghton: An Environmental History of the Pine Creek Gorge  | edition = 1st | publisher = Interprint | location = Petaluma, CA | isbn = 0-9635905-0-2  | year = 1993  | origyear = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s, lumber booms were not used along the Susquehanna and West Branch Susquehanna rivers, but they were used extensively in the [[Maine]] lumber industry. According to Taber, the idea for a very large boom on the West Branch Susquehanna River originated with John Leighton, who had worked in Maine sawmills and visited the Williamsport area in 1836. The West Branch Susquehanna River [[drainage basin]] at Williamsport is {{convert|5682|sqmi|km2|0}},&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?01551500|title= National Water Information System: Web Interface, USGS 01551500 WB Susquehanna River at Williamsport, PA |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is drained by many fairly large tributaries such as [[Sinnemahoning Creek]] and its branches, [[Kettle Creek (Pennsylvania)|Kettle Creek]], [[Pine Creek (Pennsylvania)|Pine Creek]], and Lycoming Creek. In the 19th century these streams and their tributaries reached far into the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and provided easy access to the millions of trees that covered much of Pennsylvania then.&lt;ref name="perkins"/&gt; Leighton saw that the stretch of the West Branch near Williamsport was fairly slow moving, broad, deep and calm. This stretch of river, known as the "Long Reach", proved to be the ideal setting for the construction of the Susquehanna Boom. However, the properties of the river that made it ideal for a very large boom also made it a poor location for operating water-powered sawmills. Only one such sawmill, the "Big Water Mill", operated in Williamsport prior to the establishment of the boom, and it went bankrupt at least twice.&lt;ref name="taber"/&gt;

The next several years saw two developments that made the Susquehanna boom and the sawmills associated with it feasible. The first was the development of reliable means of transportation, with the completion of the West Susquehanna Branch of the [[Pennsylvania Canal (West Branch Division)|Pennsylvania Canal]] to Williamsport in 1834 and opening of the first railroad in 1839.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; These allowed finished wood products to be taken to markets year-round, instead of just floating logs and rafts down the river during Spring and high water. The second was the gradual development and acceptance of steam engines to power sawmills, allowing large mills to operate without water-power.&lt;ref name="taber"/&gt;
 
The arrival of James H. Perkins, a native of [[New Hampshire]], in December 1845 was the beginning of the economic boom that would make Williamsport into a booming lumber city.&lt;ref name="perkins"/&gt; Perkins had been a successful owner of a [[calico (textile)|calico]] prints factory in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] prior to selling out and moving to the [[West Branch Susquehanna River Valley]]. Perkins and his business partner, John Leighton, set out with the goal of creating a large scale lumbering and milling operation. Perkins believed that Williamsport could be a major center in the lumber business, as it was surrounded by a plentiful supply of [[old-growth forest]]s of [[Tsuga canadensis|hemlock]], [[Eastern white pine|white pine]] and various [[hardwood]]s.&lt;ref name="perkins"/&gt;

The Susquehanna Boom Company was incorporated on March 26, 1846.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; There were initially 100 shares of stock issued at $100 per share. The first [[shareholder]]s were John Dubois (founder of Duboistown and later [[Dubois, Pennsylvania]]) and his brother Matthias DuBois, each with 25 shares, Perkins had 24 shares, Isaac Smith had 20 shares, Elias S. Lowe (a partner of the DuBois brothers) had five shares, and Leighton had one share, perhaps as payment for services. John DuBois was elected President of the Boom and served in that capacity until 1857.&lt;ref name="taber"/&gt;

The stockholders meeting held on November 5, 1849, saw the election of John Leighton to the chair and Elias S. Lowe was chosen as the secretary. Construction of the boom began in 1849 with the erection of two temporary booms. Periodic flooding along the West Branch slowed construction of the boom until it was ultimately completed in 1851.&lt;ref name="fiftyone"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=533 |title = Williamsport Historical Marker |accessdate = 2007-05-30 |publisher = [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When filled to capacity the {{convert|450|acre|km2}} of enclosed river could hold nearly one million logs.

==Operation==
{{wide image |Susquehanna Boom Map.PNG|1450px|Map of the Susquehanna Boom on the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]], in [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania]] in the USA, between its completion in 1873 and partial destruction in 1889.}}

The Susquehanna Boom was placed in an area of the river that had a large bend that drew the logs to the south side of the river.&lt;ref name="fiftyone"/&gt; It worked as a type of corral, a corral for logs. Operating and managing the boom was a labor-intensive endeavour. 150 men and boys were needed to sort and separate the millions of logs that floated into the Susquehanna Boom.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Boys as young as 12 worked among the cribs.&lt;ref name="wurster"/&gt; They had to identify one of over 1,700 marks found on the logs and send them along in a raft to the proper sawmill. Sorting these logs was the first job a boy could get on the Susquehanna Boom. The "Boom Rats" walked along long planks known as "stretchers" that connected the 352 cribs. They used long handled hooks to gather the logs to be tied into rafts. This was a job that required strength and agility and was the domain of young men.

The boom had to be lifted from the river at the outset of every winter before the river would freeze. This job was carried out by a group of men that worked with a [[tugboat]]. The power of the tub lifted the boom out of the water for storing on the safety of the banks of the river. Then each spring before the run of the logs down the river the boom had to be put back into place.&lt;ref name="wurster"/&gt;

The boom operated for eight months. The 150 employees were paid $1.50 per day for their work. The owners of the boom paid an average of $50,000 per year to their employees&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; for an average of $333.33 per man. This low pay compared to the millions that the owners of the boom and some of the mills brought about some hard feelings among the workers of the Susquehanna Boom. The workers of the boom, the lumber jacks, and the sawmill workers banded together in 1872 went on strike that summer.

==Sawdust War==
The strike began on July 1 and culminated with the [[riot]] known as the "Sawdust War" broke out on July 20. Nearly 3,000 men felt like they had not received a fair share of the profits. Over 5 million dollars worth of lumber had been processed the previous summer. Men like Peter Herdic, James Perkins and Mahlon Fisher had become millionaires while they struggled to feed their families with the wages earned at the dangerous jobs.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sawdust"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wasd.org/dgr/ie/sawdust.html |title = The Sawdust War |accessdate = 2007-06-02 |author = Derek Staccone and Tim Stauffer |publisher = Williamsport Area School District |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927154013/http://www.wasd.org/dgr/ie/sawdust.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the disparity in income the workers were also being forced to work twelve-hour days when the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] had recently passed a law requiring ten-hour workdays. Despite the new law the state government had no way to enforce the new rules and the owners of the lumber mills and the boom chose to ignore the law. The leaders of the lumbermen decided that going on strike would be the only way to receive the hours and pay that they felt they deserved. Their motto was, "Ten hours or no sawdust."&lt;ref name="sawdust"/&gt;

On the morning of July 1, 1872 the leaders of strike assembled in front of the Lycoming County [[Courthouse]]. They then marched to each sawmill and gathered the mill workers and/or shutdown the machinery of the mill. The strike on July 1 was relatively peaceful. The leaders of the strike became worried that the lumbermen would return to work without gaining the new working hours and higher pay that they sought. Many of the mill workers expressed worry that they would be unable to feed their families if they did not earn their wages by working.&lt;ref name="sawdust"/&gt; The leaders of the strike assembled once again on July 22 and they descended on the mills once again. This time they were met by a police force that was ordered to prevent the mills from being closed down. The strikers attempted to force their way past the police force. They threw stones at the police and the mill and the riot began. Many of the strikers armed themselves with clubs and [[revolver]]s. They chased away mill workers and tried to chase away the police.

The Pennsylvania Militia was called in to protect the interests of the sawmill owners. And the strikers fled the scene. Twenty-seven men were arrested for their role in the riot and 21 convicted by the local court for their roles in the riot on September 14, 1872.&lt;ref name="sawdust"/&gt; Twenty-one days later all of them were pardoned by Pennsylvania [[Governor]] [[John W. Geary]] as a political favor to Peter Herdic, the owner of the Susquehanna Boom.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

[[Image:Susquehanna Log Boom Islands.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Islands left from the boom cribs in the West Branch Susquehanna River are all that is left of the Susquehanna Boom today]]

==End of the Boom==
The Susquehanna Boom lost its profitability for three main reasons. First was the periodic floods that swept down the West Branch Valley following the winter snow melt and the spring rains. The West Branch Valley was devastated by a [[flood]] in 1894.&lt;ref name="hiawatha"/&gt; The sawmills along the river were largely destroyed. The boom was washed away close to two million of board feet (5,000 m³) of freshly cut timber were washed down the Susquehanna River.&lt;ref name="fiftyone"/&gt; Second were the newly constructed railroads in North Central Pennsylvania. These railroads were able to transport the fresh timber more quickly and were less risky, expensive and dangerous than floating the logs down the West Branch Susquehanna River and its tributaries.&lt;ref name="fiftyone"/&gt; Thirdly, little thought for the future was placed when the massive stands of old growth forest were harvested during the 19th century. The mountains were [[clearcutting|clear cut]]. The tops of the trees were left to dry. The passing [[steam train]]s spread burning embers along the railroad tracks. These embers would spark devastating fires that prevented the forests from regrowing.&lt;ref name="fires"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/parks/laurelmountain.aspx |title = Laurel Mountain State Park |accessdate = 2007-06-02 |publisher = [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without trees the sawmills could no longer process timber, the mills closed and eventually the boom itself was forced to close in 1908.&lt;ref name="fiftyone"/&gt;

A '''traction current pylon''' is a [[railroad]] [[Electricity pylon|pylon]] carrying at least one circuit for [[traction current]]. In Germany, traction current lines with two systems (4 conductor cables) typically have a single level arrangement of the conductor cables. For [[traction current line]]s with four systems (8 conductor cables), the two-level arrangement (4 conductor cables on each crossbar) is frequently used, except for traction current lines supplying high-speed railway lines are used. For these lines a three-level arrangement is used, in which the lowest cross bar has four conductor cables and each of the two highest cross bars have two conductor cables. The three-level arrangement is also used for traction current pylons with 6 electric circuits (12 conductor cables). For the supply of rapid-transit railways operated with alternating current, some overhead line pylons have cross bars for traction current lines above the contact wire. Other pylons carry electric circuits for traction current and also for three-phase alternating current.

Two identical capacitors are connected in parallel with an open switch between them.  One of the capacitors is charged with a voltage of &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;, the other is uncharged.  When the switch is closed, some of the charge &lt;math&gt;Q = CV_i&lt;/math&gt; on the first capacitor flows into the second, reducing the voltage on the first and increasing the voltage on the second.  When a steady state is reached and the current goes to zero, the voltage on the two capacitors must be equal since they are connected together.  Since they both have the same capacitance &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; the charge will be divided equally between the capacitors so each capacitor will have a charge of &lt;math&gt;{Q \over 2}&lt;/math&gt; and a voltage of &lt;math&gt;V_f = {Q \over 2C} = {V_i \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;.  At the beginning of the experiment the total initial energy &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt; in the circuit is the energy stored in the charged capacitor: 
:&lt;math&gt;W_i = {1 \over 2}CV_i^2&lt;/math&gt;.  
At the end of the experiment the final energy &lt;math&gt;W_f&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the sum of the energy in the two capacitors 
:&lt;math&gt;W_f = {1 \over 2}CV_f^2 + {1 \over 2}CV_f^2 = CV_f^2 = C({V_i \over 2})^2 = {1 \over 4}CV_i^2 = {1 \over 2}W_i&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the final energy &lt;math&gt;W_f&lt;/math&gt; is equal to half of the initial energy &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Where did the other half of the initial energy go?

The description specified above is not physically realizable if the circuit is assumed to be made of ideal [[circuit element]]s, as is usual in circuit theory.   If the wires connecting the two capacitors, the switch, and the capacitors themselves are idealized as having no [[electrical resistance]] or [[inductance]] as is usual, then closing the switch would connect points at different voltage with a perfect conductor,  causing an infinite current to flow.  Therefore a solution requires that one or more of the 'ideal' characteristics of the elements in the circuit be relaxed, which was not specified in the above description.  The solution differs depending on assumptions about the actual characteristics of the circuit elements:   
*If the wires are assumed to have inductance but no resistance, the current will not be infinite, but the circuit still does not have any energy dissipating components, so it will not settle to a steady state, as assumed in the description. It will constitute an [[LC circuit]] with no [[damping]], so the charge will oscillate perpetually back and forth between the two capacitors; the voltage on the two capacitors and the current will vary sinusoidally.  None of the initial energy will be lost, at any point the sum of the energy in the two capacitors and the energy stored in the magnetic field around the wires will equal the initial energy.
*If the connecting wires, in addition to having inductance and no resistance, are assumed to have a nonzero length, the oscillating circuit will act as an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] and lose energy by radiating [[electromagnetic wave]]s (radio waves).  The effect of this energy loss is exactly the same as if there were a resistance called the [[radiation resistance]] in the circuit, so the circuit will be equivalent to an [[RLC circuit]].   The oscillating current in the wires will be an [[exponential decay|exponentially decaying]] [[sinusoid]].  Since none of the original charge is lost, the final state of the capacitors will be as described above, with half the initial voltage on each capacitor.  Since in this state the capacitors contain half the initial energy, the missing half of the energy will have been radiated away by the electromagnetic waves.
*If the wires are assumed to have any nonzero resistance at all, it is an [[RC circuit]], and the current will [[exponential decay|decrease exponentially]] to zero.  As in the previous case, since no charge is lost, the circuit will settle into the static final state as described above.  Since in this state the two capacitors together are left with half the energy,  regardless of the amount of resistance half of the initial energy will be dissipated as heat in the wire resistance.
*If in addition to resistance and inductance the wires have nonzero length and act as an antenna, the total energy loss will be the same, but will be divided between the radiated electromagnetic waves and heat dissipated in the resistance.
Various additional solutions have been devised, based on more detailed assumptions about the characteristics of the components.

==Alternate versions==
There are several alternate versions of the paradox.  One is the original circuit with the two capacitors initially charged with equal and opposite voltages &lt;math&gt;+V_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-V_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Another equivalent version is a single charged capacitor [[short circuit]]ed by a perfect conductor.  In these cases in the final state the entire charge has been neutralized, the final voltage on the capacitors is zero, so the entire initial energy has vanished.  The solutions to where the energy went are similar to those described in the previous section.

'''Ven Kirantidiye Pannasekera''' was a pioneer in environmental conservation activism starting from 1981.

He started an organization named [[Friends of Nature]] to help protect the [[Sinharaja Forest]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. He was able to form the "Sri Lanka Environmental Congress" by gathering all the scattered environmental organizations at village level in 1986. He became the first secretary in 1986. In 1987 he was instrumental in starting the first Environmental Village program by teaming up with the
[[National Housing authority]] and [[Central Environmental Authority]] in Sri Lanka.

A '''washer''' is a thin plate (typically disk-shaped) with a hole (typically in the middle) that is normally used to distribute the load of a [[threaded fastener]], such as a [[Bolt (fastener)|bolt]] or [[Nut (hardware)|nut]]. Other uses are as a spacer, spring ([[Belleville washer]], wave washer), wear pad, [[preload (engineering)|preload]] indicating device, locking device, and to reduce vibration ([[rubber washer]]). Washers often have an outer [[diameter]] (OD) about twice their inner diameter (ID), but this can vary quite widely.

Washers are usually [[metal]] or [[plastic]]. High-quality [[bolted joint]]s require hardened steel washers to prevent the loss of pre-load due to [[Brinelling]] after the [[torque]] is applied.

[[Rubber]] or [[fiber]] [[gasket]]s used in [[tap (valve)|taps]] (or faucets, or valves) to stop the flow of water are sometimes referred to colloquially as ''washers''; but, while they may look similar, washers and gaskets are usually designed for different functions and made differently.

Washers are also important for preventing [[galvanic corrosion]], particularly by insulating steel screws from aluminium surfaces.

The origin of the word is unknown; the first recorded use of the word was in 1346, however, the first time its definition was recorded was in 1611.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1713/whats-the-purpose-of-washers-the-round-metal-things|title=The Straight Dope: What's the purpose of washers (the round metal things)?|website=www.straightdope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washers may also be used in rotating applications, as a bearing. A '''thrust washer''' is used when a [[rolling element bearing]] is not needed either from a cost-performance perspective or due to space restraints. [[Coating]]s can be used in attempt to reduce wear and friction either by hardening their surface, or providing a solid lubricant (i.e. a self-lubricating surface).

==Type and form==
[[File:Bolt, Plain washer and Spring lock washer.jpg|thumb|A plain washer and a spring washer are placed on a bolt between the nut (on the threaded end) and the bolt head.]]
 
Washers can be categorised into three types; 
* ''Plain washers'', which spread a load, and prevent damage to the surface being fixed, or provide some sort of insulation such as electrical
* ''Spring washers'', which have axial flexibility and are used to prevent fastening or loosening due to vibrations
* ''Locking washers'', which prevent fastening or loosening by preventing unscrewing rotation of the fastening device; locking washers are usually also spring washers.

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) provides standards for general use flat washers. Type A is a series of steel washers at broad tolerances, where precision is not critical. Type B is a series of flat washers with tighter tolerances where outside diameters are categorized as "narrow", "regular" or "wide" for specific bolt sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bokers.com/standard_washers.asp|title=Standard Washers - Boker's, Inc.|website=www.bokers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Type" is not to be confused with "form" (but often is). The [[British Standard]] for Metric Series Metal Washers (BS4320), written in 1968, coined the term "form". The forms go from A to G and dictate the outside diameter and thickness of the flat washers.
* Form A: Normal diameter, normal thickness
* Form B: Normal diameter, light thickness
* Form C: Large diameter, normal thickness
* Form D: Large diameter, light thickness
* Form E: Larger diameter, normal thickness
* Form F: Larger diameter, normal thickness
* Form G: Largest diameter, larger thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fixingsmegastore.co.uk/support/different-forms-of-washers|title=What are the differences between different forms of washers?|website=fixingsmegastore.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Fender washer (US), penny washer, mudguard washer, or "repair washer" (UK)
| [[File:Fender_washer.tif|100px]]
| A flat washer with a particularly large outer diameter in proportion to its central hole. These are commonly used to spread the load on thin sheet metal, and are named after their use on [[Fender (vehicle)|automobile fender]]s. They can also be used to make a connection to a hole that has been enlarged by rust or wear. In the UK, the name originally comes from the size of the [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|old British penny]]. In the UK, most industries refer to all large OD washers as penny washers, even when the OD is as much as twice the size of the old penny.

An archaic form of this washer was sold as a "pot mender", usually in small quantities through a retail ironmonger. This included two washers, a nut and bolt and a sealing washer of rubber, cork or fibre sheet. They could be used for sealing small holes, rust spots or removed pipe connections in water tanks or large cooking vessels.

Spring washers are a left hand helix and allow the thread to be tightened in a right hand direction only, i.e. a clockwise direction. When a left hand turning motion is applied, the raised edge bites into the underside of the bolt or nut and the part that it is bolted to, thus resisting turning. Therefore, spring washers are ineffective on left hand threads &lt;!--I don't buy this argument about them being directional, and I have not found other mentions of this limitation. I do agree they are not effective lock washers in many situations.  ~Slightlymighty  --&gt; and hardened surfaces {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Also, they are not to be used in conjunction with a flat washer under the spring washer, as this isolates the spring washer from biting into the component that will resist turning.  &lt;!-- The spring function still exists even if a flat washer is present, it is true the biting action would be eliminated (but other types of lock washers are better at biting in anyway). Some sites even say to use them with flat washers, but there is a lot of questionable info on this topic. --&gt; 

The use and effectiveness of spring lock washers has been in debate of late,{{When|date=December 2015}} with some publications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/helicalspringwashers.htm|title=Helical Spring Washers|website=www.boltscience.com|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Who|date=December 2015}} advising against their use on the grounds that, when tight, the washer is flat against the substrate and gives no more resistance to rotation than a normal washer at the same torque. NASA researchers have gone as far as to say "In summary, a lockwasher of this type is useless for locking."&lt;ref&gt;IS 3063 : 1994 Fasteners - Single coil rectangular section spring lock washers - Specification&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Fastener Design Manual|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19900009424_1990009424.pdf|website=NASA.gov|publisher=NASA|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a spring washer will continue to hold the bolt against the substrate and maintain friction when loosened slightly, whereas a plain washer will not.{{Efn|Bowman Fastener (Barnes Co) in their Technical Series Fastener Facts Circa 1999 states on pages 32 and 33 states that lock washers are dangerous and obsolete and SAE recommended in 1969 that they not be used in any critical application other than sheet metal or inspection plates. BMW made them unacceptable in drive shafts as they were found to have broken and loss of space left the U-joint bolts loose and damage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}}}

The benefit of spring lock washers lies in the trapezoidal shape of the washer. When compressed to loads near the proof strength of the bolt, it will twist and flatten. This reduces the spring rate of the bolted joint which allows it to maintain more force under the same vibration levels. This prevents loosening.&lt;ref&gt;Bickford. John H.

| Toothed lock washer, serrated washer or star washer&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;
| [[File:External tooth lock washer.tif|Toothed lock washer with external teeth|100px]]
| A washer with serrations that extend radially inward or outward to bite into the [[bearing surface]]. This type of washer is especially effective as a lock washer when used with a soft substrate, such as aluminium or plastic,&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; and can resist rotation more than a plain washer on hard surfaces, as the tension between washer and the surface is applied over a much smaller area (the teeth). There are four types: internal, external, combination, and countersunk. The internal style has the serrations along the inner edge of the washer, which makes them more aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Specifications for Internal Tooth Lock Washers ASME B18.21.1-1999 |url=http://www.aspenfasteners.com/v/vspfiles/files/docs/internal_tooth_lockwasher_specification.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The external style has the serrations around the outer edge, which provides better holding power, because of the greater circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Specifications for External Tooth Lock Washers ASME B18.21.1-1999 |url=http://www.aspenfasteners.com/v/vspfiles/files/docs/external_tooth_lockwasher_specification.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination style has serrations about both edges, for maximum holding power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Specifications for Internal/External Tooth Lock Washers ASME B18.21.1-1999 |url=http://www.aspenfasteners.com/v/vspfiles/files/docs/internal_external_tooth_lockwasher_specification.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countersunk style is designed to be used with flat-head screws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Specifications for Countersunk External Tooth Lock Washers ASME B18.21.1-1999 |url=http://www.aspenfasteners.com/v/vspfiles/files/docs/countersunk_external_tooth_lockwasher_specification.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tooth lockwashers are also used for ground bonding where a metal lug or object must be electrically bonded to a surface. The teeth of the washer cut through surface oxides, paints or other finishes and provide a gas-tight conductive path. In these applications, the washer is not placed under the head of the screw (or under the nut), it is placed between the surfaces to be bonded. In such applications, the tooth washer does not provide any anti-rotation locking features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Improved Bonding and Grounding Methods for Electrical / Electronic Equipment|url=http://www.nsrp.org/3-RA-Panel_Final_Reports/2011_Improved_Bonding_and_Grounding_Final_Report.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lock washers, [[locknut]]s, [[jam nut]]s, and [[thread-locking fluid]] are ways to prevent vibration from loosening a [[bolted joint]].

===Gaskets===
The term washer is often applied to various gasket types such as those used to seal the control valve in [[Tap (valve)|taps]]. Crush washers are made of a soft metal such as aluminium or copper, and are used to seal fluid or gas connections such as those found in an internal combustion engine.

==Materials==
Washers can be fabricated from a variety of materials including, but not limited to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stampings &amp; Washers {{!}} Accutrex|url = http://www.accutrex.com/stampings_and_washers|website = www.accutrex.com|access-date = 2016-02-11|first = |last = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Specialty – [[Fiber]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[Natural rubber|rubber]], [[felt]], [[leather]], bimetals, and [[mica]]

=== Corrosion resistance ===
A number of techniques are used to enhance the [[corrosion]] resistant properties of certain washer materials:
* Metallic coatings – Typical coatings used to produce corrosion resistant washers are zinc, [[cadmium]], and nickel. Zinc coating acts as a sacrificial surface layer that falls victim to corrosive materials before the washer's material can be harmed. Cadmium produces a high-quality protective surface but is toxic, both biologically and environmentally. Nickel coatings add protection from corrosion only when the finish is dense and non-porous.
* [[Electroplating]] – This method involves coating the washer by electrolytic deposition using metals such as [[chromium]] or [[silver]].
* Phosphating – A resilient, but [[abrasive]] surface is achieved by incorporating a [[Zinc phosphate|zinc-phosphate]] layer and corrosion-protective oil. 
* Browning or bluing – Exposing the washer (typically steel) to a chemical compound or [[alkali]] salt solution causes an [[Oxidation|oxidizing]] chemical reaction, which results in the creation of a corrosion-resistant, colored surface. The integrity of the coating can improved by treating the finished product with a water-displacing oil.
* Chemical plating – This technique utilizes a nickel-phosphor alloy that is precipitated onto the washer surface, creating an extremely corrosion- and abrasive-resistant surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Washers Information {{!}} IHS Engineering360|url = http://www.globalspec.com/learnmore/mechanical_components/mechanical_fasteners/washers|website = www.globalspec.com|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Watercolor paper''' is paper or substrate onto which an artists applies watercolor [[Paint|paints]], [[Pigment|pigments]] or [[Dye|dyes]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://watercolor.net/history-overview/|title=Watercolor, Watermedia, Then And Now-Early Cultures, Asian, Middle East, Early European|last=|first=|date=|website=watercolor.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently many types of paper available that are manufactured for the use with watercolors. Watercolor paper can be made of wood pulp exclusively, or mixed with [[cotton]] fibers. Pure cotton watercolor paper is also used by artists though it typically costs more than paper. It is also available as an acid-free medium to help its preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artistsnetwork.com/art-mediums/watercolor/understanding-the-different-grades-of-watercolor-paper/|title=Understanding the Different Grades of Watercolor Paper|date=2017-07-14|work=Artists Network|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watercolor paper can be described according to the manufacturing process. It can be hot pressed, cold pressed or rough. A number of companies sell watercolor papers, some of them with a long history of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/paper2.html|title=Handprint : light and the eye|last=MacEvoy|first=Bruce|date=August 1, 2015|website=www.handprint.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Papyrus]] was used as a 'paper' onto which the [[Egyptians]] applied their water-based paints or pigments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Arches, began production of watercolor paper around 1620. It provided most of the paper used in France during the 1700s. In addition to watercolor paper, Arches also produced paper that was used in documents and paper that was used as currency during the revolution in France. Arches joined other paper manufacturers in the 1950s to form Arjomari Prioux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/paper2a.html|title=Handprint : arches|last=|first=|date=|website=www.handprint.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woven paper was used in print publication in the late 1760's because it was found to be smoother. The watercolor paper at this time was used by artists because it allowed the application of paint without the unevenness of molded paper. James Whatman created a paper specifically for use with water colors by the 1780s. He used [[gelatin]] as a sizing that created a protective coating that reduced damage to the paper by repeated wetting, drying and reworking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bwtr/hd_bwtr.htm|title=Watercolor Painting in Britain, 1750–1850 See works of art|last=Barker|first=Elizabeth E.|date=October 2004|website=The Metropolitian Museum of Art|series=Department of Drawings and Prints, The Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wellsite Information Transfer Specification''' (WITS) is a specification for the transfer of [[drilling rig]]-related data. This [[petroleum industry]] standard is recognized by a number of companies internationally and is supported by many [[computer hardware|hardware]] devices and [[software]] applications.&lt;!--{{Citation needed}} begin--&gt;{{fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed |text=citation needed |class=Template-Fact }}&lt;!--{{Citation needed}} end--&gt;

WITS is a multi-layered specification:

* '''Layer 0''' describes an ASCII-based transfer specification
* '''Layer 1''' describes a binary-based format based on 25 predefined fixed-size records and the [[Log Information Standard]] (LIS) data-transmission specification
* '''Layer 2''' describes bidirectional communication using LIS Comment records
* '''Layer 2b''' describes buffering of data
* '''Layer 4''' extends the previous layers to use a different data exchange format, [http://www.posc.org/technical/data_exchange/RP66/V1/Toc/main.html RP66]

Though still in active use as of 2013, the specification has been superseded by the XML-based [http://www.witsml.org/ WITSML].

'''Zircon''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|z|ɜr|k|ɒ|n}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/zircon|title=Zircon definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|zircon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɜr|k|ən}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zircon|title=Definition of ZIRCON|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[mineral]] belonging to the group of [[nesosilicates]]. Its chemical name is [[zirconium silicate]], and its corresponding chemical formula is [[Zirconium|Zr]][[Silicate|SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]. A common [[empirical formula]] showing some of the range of substitution in zircon is (Zr&lt;sub&gt;1–y&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Rare earth elements|REE]]&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;)(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1–x&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4x–y&lt;/sub&gt;. Zircon forms in [[silicate]] [[Melt (geology)|melts]] with large proportions of [[Incompatible element|high field strength incompatible elements]]. For example, [[hafnium]] is almost always present in quantities ranging from 1 to 4%. The [[crystal structure]] of zircon is [[tetragonal]] [[crystal system]]. The natural color of zircon varies between colorless, yellow-golden, red, brown, blue and green. Colorless specimens that show [[gem]] quality are a popular substitute for [[diamond]] and are also known as "Matura diamond".

The name derives from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''zargun'', meaning "gold-hued".&lt;ref name="Stwertka"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stwertka|first=Albert|title=A Guide to the Elements|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|pages=117–119| isbn = 0-19-508083-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is corrupted into "[[jargoon]]", a term applied to light-colored zircons. The English word "zircon" is derived from ''Zirkon'', which is the German adaptation of this word.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|zircon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow, orange and red zircon is also known as "[[hyacinth (gemstone)|hyacinth]]",&lt;ref name="Hyacinth1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/hyacinth-gem | title=Hyacinth (gem) | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. | work=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the flower ''[[Hyacinth (plant)|hyacinthus]]'', whose name is of [[Ancient Greek]] origin.

==Properties==
[[Image:zircon microscope.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Optical microscope photograph; the length of the crystal is about 250 [[µm]]]]

Zircon is ubiquitous in the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] of Earth. It occurs as a common [[accessory mineral]] in [[igneous rock]]s (as primary crystallization products), in [[metamorphic rock]]s and as detrital grains in [[sedimentary rock]]s.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt; Large zircon crystals are rare. Their average size in [[granitoid|granite]] rocks is about 0.1–0.3&amp;nbsp;mm, but they can also grow to sizes of several centimeters, especially in mafic [[pegmatite]]s and [[carbonatite]]s.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt; Zircon is also very resistant to heat and corrosion.

Because of their [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] content, some zircons undergo [[metamictization]]. Connected to internal radiation damage, these processes partially disrupt the crystal structure and partly explain the highly variable properties of zircon. As zircon becomes more and more modified by internal radiation damage, the density decreases, the crystal structure is compromised, and the color changes.

Zircon occurs in many colors, including reddish brown, yellow, green, blue, gray and colorless.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;  The color of zircons can sometimes be changed by heat treatment. Common brown zircons can be transformed into colorless and blue zircons by heating to 800 to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Gemdat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemdat.org/gem-4421.html|title=Zircon gemstone information|author=|date=|website=www.gemdat.org|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In geological settings, the development of pink, red, and purple zircon occurs after hundreds of millions of years, if the crystal has sufficient trace elements to produce [[F-Center|color centers]]. Color in this red or pink series is annealed in geological conditions above temperatures of around 400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195102000549|title=Integration of zircon color and zircon fission-track zonation patterns in orogenic belts: application to the Southern Alps, New Zealand|author=|date=May 6, 2002|publisher=|journal=Tectonophysics|volume=349|issue=1-4|pages=203–219|accessdate=April 29, 2018|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/S0040-1951(02)00054-9|bibcode=2002Tectp.349..203G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[Image:ZirconUSGOV.jpg|thumb|left|Sand-sized grains of zircon]]
Zircon is mainly consumed as an [[opacifier]], and has been known to be used in the decorative ceramics industry.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Ralph Nielsen "Zirconium and Zirconium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_543}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the principal precursor not only to metallic [[zirconium]], although this application is small, but also to all compounds of zirconium including [[zirconium dioxide]] (ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), one of the most [[refractory]] materials known.

Other applications include use in refractories and foundry casting and a growing array of specialty applications as zirconia and zirconium chemicals, including in nuclear fuel rods, catalytic fuel converters and in water and air purification systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mineralcommodities.com/products/|title=Products|website=Mineral Commodities Ltd|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zircon is one of the key minerals [[Radiometric dating|used]] by geologists for [[geochronology]].

Zircon is a part of the [[ZTR index]] to classify highly-[[weathering|weathered]] [[sediment]]s.
&lt;!-- This is not an application: 
*Large specimens are appreciated as [[gemstone]]s, owing to their high [[refractive index]]. (Zircon has a refractive index of approximately 1.95; [[diamond]]'s is approximately 2.4.)--&gt;

==Occurrence==
[[Image:Zirconium mineral concentrates - world production trend.svg|thumb|left|World production trend of zirconium mineral concentrates]]
Zircon is a common accessory to trace mineral constituent of most [[granite]] and [[felsic]] igneous rocks. Due to its hardness, durability and chemical inertness, zircon persists in sedimentary deposits and is a common constituent of most sands. Zircon is rare within [[mafic rock]]s and very rare within [[ultramafic]] rocks aside from a group of [[Ultrapotassic igneous rocks|ultrapotassic intrusive rocks]] such as [[kimberlite]]s, carbonatites, and lamprophyre, where zircon can occasionally be found as a trace mineral owing to the unusual magma genesis of these rocks.

Zircon forms economic concentrations within [[heavy mineral sands ore deposits]], within certain [[pegmatite]]s, and within some rare alkaline volcanic rocks, for example the Toongi Trachyte, Dubbo, New South Wales Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alkane.com.au/images/pdf/Media/20141023.pdf|title=Dubbo Zirconia Project Fact Sheet June 2014|date= June 2007|author=Staff |work=Alkane Resources Limited |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in association with the zirconium-hafnium minerals [[eudialyte]] and armstrongite.

Australia leads the world in zircon mining, producing 37% of the world total and accounting for 40% of world EDR (economic demonstrated resources) for the mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zircon-association.org/Websites/zircon/images/Resources/the-mineral-sands-industry-factbook-(feb-2014).pdf|title=The Mineral Sands Industry Factbook|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa is Africa’s main producer, with 30% of world production, second after Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbendi.com/indy/ming/hvym/af/p0005.htm|title=Heavy Minerals Mining in Africa - Titanium And Zirconium|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiometric dating==
Zircon has played an important role during the evolution of [[radiometric dating]]. Zircons contain trace amounts of uranium and thorium (from 10 [[Parts per million|ppm]] up to 1 wt%) and can be dated using several modern analytical techniques. Because zircons can survive geologic processes like [[erosion]], transport, even high-grade [[metamorphism]], they contain a rich and varied record of geological processes. Currently, zircons are typically dated by [[uranium-lead dating|uranium-lead]] (U-Pb), [[fission track dating|fission-track]], [[cathodoluminescence]], and U+Th/He techniques. For instance, imaging the cathodoluminescence emission from fast electrons can be used as a prescreening tool for high-resolution secondary-ion-mass spectrometry (SIMS) to image the zonation pattern and identify regions of interest for isotope analysis. This is done using an integrated cathodoluminescence and scanning electron microscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://request.delmic.com/zircon-application-note|title=Zircons - Application Note {{!}} DELMIC|last=BV|first=DELMIC|website=request.delmic.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Detrital zircon geochronology|Zircons in sedimentary rock]] can identify the sediment source.

Zircons from [[Jack Hills]] in the [[Narryer Gneiss Terrane]], [[Yilgarn Craton]], [[Western Australia]], have yielded [[uranium-lead dating|U-Pb]] ages up to 4.404 billion years,&lt;ref name="Wilde"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilde S.A., Valley J.W., Peck W.H. and Graham C.M.|year=2001|title=Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4 Gyr ago|journal=Nature|volume=409|url=http://www.geology.wisc.edu/%7Evalley/zircons/Wilde2001Nature.pdf|doi=10.1038/35051550|pmid=11196637|issue=6817|pages=175–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted to be the age of crystallization, making them the [[oldest rock|oldest minerals]] so far dated on Earth. In addition, the [[oxygen]] [[isotope|isotopic]] compositions of some of these zircons have been interpreted to indicate that more than 4.4 billion years ago there was already water on the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mojzsis, S.J., Harrison, T.M., Pidgeon, R.T.|year=2001|title= Oxygen-isotope evidence from ancient zircons for liquid water at the Earth's surface 4300 Myr ago|journal=Nature|volume=409|pages=178–181|doi=10.1038/35051557|pmid=11196638|issue=6817|last2=Harrison|last3=Pidgeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is supported by additional trace element data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ushikubo, T., Kita, N.T., Cavosie, A.J., Wilde, S.A.
