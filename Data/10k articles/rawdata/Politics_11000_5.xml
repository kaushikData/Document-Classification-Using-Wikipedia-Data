As the [[pandemic]] progressed, laboratory testing and confirmation decreased. Confirmed figures for the [[2009 flu pandemic in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], in particular, are only meaningful up to 2 July, when routine testing stopped and presumed cases were treated without laboratory confirmation of diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), many countries stopped issuing estimates of the infected population, making this list inaccurate.

On 30 May 2009 the first three cases were confirmed in Lebanon. "One Lebanese man who was in Spain and two Canadians who arrived in Lebanon a week ago are suffering from swine flu," the health minister said. "We put them in quarantine and the blood samples we have taken every day have proven to be positive. The Lebanese man and the two visiting Canadians – a woman and her daughter – were given the proper medical treatment in time and they are well now." The Lebanese Health Minister had previously asked citizens to stop the habit of social kissing, that affected schoolchildren be kept at home and that travel to countries in which cases have been confirmed be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUKTRE53R3D320090428 |title=Lebanese told not to kiss in anti-swine flu drive &amp;#124; Lifestyle &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2009 |first=Nadim |last=Ladki| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090501145551/http://uk.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUKTRE53R3D320090428| archivedate= 1 May 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beirut also banned the import of pork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodbizdaily.com/articles/28988-swine-flu-fear-prompts-lebanon-to-ban-pork-imports.aspx |title=News: Swine flu Fear Prompts Lebanon to Ban Pork Imports |publisher=Foodbizdaily.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=30 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503110754/http://foodbizdaily.com/articles/28988-swine-flu-fear-prompts-lebanon-to-ban-pork-imports.aspx| archivedate= 3 May 2009 | deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting bias==

Epidemiologists cautioned that the number of cases reported in the early days of an outbreak could be very inaccurate.&lt;ref name = bias&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/health/28docs.html?hpw |title=Sound the alarm? A swine flu bind |author=Altman Lawrence K |date=28 April 2009 |work=New York Times |accessdate=30 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503111111/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/health/28docs.html?hpw| archivedate=3 May 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes included selection bias, media bias and incorrect reporting by governments.

[[Selection bias]] in [[epidemiology]] occurs when authorities in different jurisdictions look at differing sets of patient. For example, in the early days of the pandemic, doctors in Mexico may have been concentrating on patients in hospitals, rather than the larger vulnerable population. This may in part explain the higher mortality recorded there.&lt;ref name = bias/&gt; Conversely, it is implausible that few, if any, died in Mexico while Brazil and the United States accumulated hundreds of additional lab-confirmed deaths. [[Media bias]] may have skewed incidence maps based on these media reports.  Countries with poor health care systems and poor laboratory facilities may take longer to identify suspected cases, analyse those cases and report them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Reuters |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/2687d9562c28b487c30aca4e889c5e93.htm |title=GLOBAL: No A (H1N1) cases – reality or poor lab facilities? |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=9 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511130411/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/2687d9562c28b487c30aca4e889c5e93.htm| archivedate= 11 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive data collection methodologies (waiting for the patient to arrive at a health care facility) are considered inferior to active data collection techniques (performing random [[stratified sampling]]) due to selection bias&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/yes/4297_MODULE_19.pdf |title=Observational studies and bias in epidemiology |publisher=College board |format=PDF |year=2004 |accessdate=30 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090423151327/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/yes/4297_MODULE_19.pdf| archivedate= 23 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because laboratory facilities to perform swift genetic tests on patient samples are not widely available.&lt;ref name = bias/&gt; {{As of|2009|07}} there no properly controlled epidemiological studies had been conducted for the 2009 outbreak.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1847">Action Against Austerity is  a grassroots network of groups in Scotland opposing [[Austerity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://actionagainstausterity.wordpress.com/|title=Action Against Austerity |website=Action Against Austerity|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network formed in 2015 from signatories to  the "From Yes to Action statement" which was founded by the [[Autonomous Centre of Edinburgh|autonomous centre of Edinburgh]], the Edinburgh section of the [[Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland)|Anarchist Federation]], the Edinburgh branch of [[Industrial Workers of the World|The Industrial Workers of The World]] and [[Edinburgh coalition Against Poverty|Edinburgh Coalition Against Poverty]]  and all  of which are members of the network  .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edinburghanarchists.noflag.org.uk/2014/11/from-yes-to-action-joint-statement-on-post-referendum-organising/|title=From Yes to Action {{!}} Joint statement on post-referendum organising|website=edinburghanarchists.noflag.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other members include Dundee Against Welfare Sanctions(DAWS) now called Dundee Against Austerity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://actionagainstausterity.wordpress.com/2015/05/24/from-yes-to-action-joint-statement-on-post-referendum-organising/|title=From Yes to Action {{!}} Joint statement on post-referendum organising|last=edinburghwobbly|date=2015-05-24|website=Action Against Austerity|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWW Scottish Assembly voted to support "From Yes to action" and so Clydeside(Glasgow) IWW joined along with  Edinburgh.

==History==
The coalition has called upon the opposition to break ties with figures they call "corrupt" from the [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] regime.&lt;ref name=ao29June/&gt; Notably, the political wing of the group (the [[Building and Development Party]]) and the [[Wasat Party]] did not take part in protests held by pro-Morsi forces during the week of 18 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Towards Negotiations|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/4458/17/Towards-negotiations.aspx|agency=Al-Ahram Weekly On-line|date=23 October 2013|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance offered a new reconciliation initiative that does not include the reinstatement of Morsi on 26 October 2013; [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]], [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] and the [[Homeland Party (Egypt)|Homeland Party]] are not calling for the reinstatement of Morsi, while the [[Virtue Party (Egypt)|Virtue Party]], [[Authenticity Party]] and the [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]] are still demanding that Morsi be reinstated as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/pro-morsy-alliance-offers-new-initiative-political-deadlock|title=Pro-Morsy alliance offers new initiative for political deadlock|publisher=Egypt Independent|date=26 October 2013|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has reached out to what it called "fellow revolutionaries" to cooperate with them against the protest law in Egypt in order to jointly organize protests; [[Kefaya]] objected to the call for cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.madamasr.com/content/anti-coup-alliance-holds-out-hand-revolutionaries|title=Anti-coup alliance holds out hand to revolutionaries|publisher=Mada Masr|date=28 November 2013|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Building and Development Party]], the political arm of [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]], wanted to meet with [[Yasser Al Borhamy]], the deputy head of the [[Salafist Call]] as well as [[Emad Abdel Ghaffour]], who is the head of the Homeland Party.&lt;ref name=ei26Nov&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/pro-morsy-alliance-ask-salafis-mediate-army-end-crisis|title=Pro-Morsy alliance ask Salafis to mediate with the Army to end crisis|publisher=Egypt Independent|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Borhamy reportedly could not meet with the members, while Ghaffour asked them to stop demonstrations before talks could begin and rebuffed their demands for the reinstatement of Morsi and the bringing back of the [[Shura Council]] that was dissolved.&lt;ref name=ei26Nov/&gt; Borhami denied being asked to serve as a mediator, though he stated that he would act as a mediator if there were no preconditions.&lt;ref name=ei26Nov/&gt; The alliance has said it will boycott the [[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2014|2014 constitutional referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Egypt's pro-Morsi coalition to boycott constitutional referendum|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/89799.aspx|agency=Ahram Online|date=22 December 2013|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various groups and parties within the alliance including [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]], the Building and Development Party, the Islamic Party, the Freedom and Justice Party and the Virtue Party have criticized the [[Nour Party]] for its support of the draft constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Nour Party under Islamists’ fire over ‘yes’ vote call|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/nour-party-under-islamists-fire-over-%E2%80%98yes-vote-call|agency=Egypt Independent|date=6 December 2013|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Islamic Party (Egypt)|Islamic Party]] has not participated in meetings with the group because of what [[Mohamed Abu Samra]] (the secretary-general of the party) called the "[[Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt|brotherhood's]] radical thought".&lt;ref name=cp30april&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thecairopost.com/news/108571/news/salafist-front-calls-on-nasl-to-suspend-activities|title=Salafist Front calls on NASL to suspend activities|work=Cairo Post|date=30 April 2014|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Salafist Front]] issued a statement on 30 April 2014 that called on the alliance to temporarily stop its actions in order to avoid more violence;&lt;ref name=cp30april/&gt; the alliance did not suspend its activities in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thecairopost.com/news/108746/news/108746|title=NASL hasn’t suspended activities: Watan Party|work=Cairo Post|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian Prime minister [[Ibrahim Mahlab]] issued a decree on 16 October 2014 banning the alliance.&lt;ref name=ao16Oct&gt;{{Citation|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/113258.aspx|title=Egypt's PM bans pro-Morsi NASL alliance|publisher=Ahram Online|date=16 October 2014|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another decree was issued on 30 October 2014 which dissolved the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/30/us-egypt-brotherhood-ban-idUSKBN0IJ0QT20141030|title=Egypt bans pro-Mursi pressure group|publisher=Reuters|date=30 October 2014|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A court postponed the appeal of the dissolution of the alliance until 13 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=06112014&amp;id=0a6d77cd-bea5-4899-98d8-4dfea70b4629|title=

The '''Arab Congress of 1913''' (also known as the "Arab National Congress,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tibi|first=Bassam|title=Arab Nationalism: A Critical Enquiry|year=1981|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=0-312-04716-9|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;" "First Palestinian Conference," the "First Arab Congress,&lt;ref name="Thomas 1976 318"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=David|title=Essays on Islamic Civilization|year=1976|publisher=E.J. Brill|isbn=90-04-04464-7|pages=318|editor=Donald P. Little}}&lt;/ref&gt;" and the "Arab-Syrian Congress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dockser Marcus|first=Amy|title=Jerusalem 1913|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;") met in a hall of the French Geographical Society ([[Société de Géographie]]) at 184 [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]], [[Paris]] from June 18–23 in Paris to discuss reforms to grant the [[Arabs]] living under the [[Ottoman Empire]] more autonomy. The Arab National Congress, was established by 25 official Arab Nationalists delegates to discuss desired reforms to grant Arabs more autonomy under the Ottoman Empire. 
It took place at a time of uncertainty and change in the Ottoman Empire: in the years leading up to [[World War I]], the Empire had undergone a [[Young Turk Revolution|revolution]] (1908) and a [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état|coup]] (1913) by the [[Young Turks]], and had been defeated in two wars against [[Italo-Turkish War|Italy]] and the [[First Balkan War|Balkan states]]. The Arabs were agitating for more rights under the fading empire and early glimmers of [[Arab nationalism]] were emerging. A number of dissenting and reform-oriented groups formed in [[Greater Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Constantinople]], and [[Egypt]]. Under [[Zionist]] influence, [[Jewish immigration to Palestine]] was increasing, and England and France were expressing interest in the region, competing for spheres of influence.

[[File:Paris-bld-saint-germain.jpg|250px|thumb|Boulevard Saint-Germain at the corner of Rue de Buci. Buildings shown between the corner of the rue de Buci and rue de Seine are the original North side of the former rue des Boucheries.]]
It was under these conditions that a group of students living in Paris called for a Congress to be held to discuss proposed Arab reforms.  While the Congress was not ultimately successful in its proposed aims, it was a reflection of events taking place and dynamics that shaped the early 20th century for three continents before [[World War I]] began.  Many scholars place the origins of [[Arab nationalism]] during these crucial years that witnessed a dwindling of empires and a build-up of tension surrounding Zionist immigration to Palestine and Arab reaction to it. The whole Congress declared itself ready to struggle to bring the Arab Nation into being by means of revolution. [[Al-Hoda]] Editor and Lebanese League of Progress President, [[Naoum Mokarzel]] started cautiously by saying that: “The Revolution must be literary and reformist”, he continued more aggressively “only the last resort should it be bloody, because the political systems of free nations have been constructed by martyrs and not with printers ink.” »&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Arab-Nationalism-Between-Islam-Nation-State/dp/0312162863/ref=wl_it_dp_o_npd?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I2HL5XJRTDJ9J7&amp;colid=1GGYTSFVBC74S»]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ottoman Empire==
The [[Ottoman Empire]] was in a state of decline at the beginning of the 20th century.  In 1908, a revolt led by the [[Young Turks]] led to regime change that briefly led to increased freedom of expression until the Turkish crackdown of 1915-1916.  Attempts by the regime to contain Western influence, implement an increasingly centralized government, and movement toward the "[[Turkification]]" of Arab lands prompted resistance from parts of the Arab world. [[Balkan Wars|War]] broke out in the [[Balkans]] in October 1912, further weakening Istanbul's hold over its domain. (N)

==Arab nationalism==
Scholars disagree over when exactly [[Arab nationalism]] began, but there were glimmers of a distinctive Arab identity beginning to form, partly in response to perceived Ottoman oppression, in the years leading up to the Arab Congress.  Particular concerns included the desire to speak Arabic in the public sphere, a decentralized administration (i.e. more local control over administrative matters), and the right for Arab soldiers to serve in their own region, rather than a distant corner of the empire.

===Reform organisations===
A number of reform-minded groups sprung up in these early years before World War I.  Many remained secret so as to avoid government infiltration.

* Beirut Reform Society, "Jam'iyyat Beirut al-'Islahiyya," (Beirut, 1912)
** sent a delegation of six to the conference
** members: [[Salim Ali Salam]], Ahmad Bayhum, among others
** wanted French government to pressure the Unionist government to grant desired reforms&lt;ref name="Thomas 1976 318"/&gt;



* The [[Young Arab Society]], "al-Fatat," (Paris, 1911)
** called for the Arab congress in order to "demonstrate the unity and strength of the Arab movement" as well as to discuss reforms (Thomas)
** members: Abd al-Ghani al-Uraysi, [[Jamil Mardam Bey]], and [[Awni Abd al-Hadi]], Palestinian [[Rafiq al-Tamimi]], the Iraqi [[Tawfiq al-Suwaidi]], Ahmad Rustum Haydat, and Ahmad Qadri, among others
* Arab League Society, "Jam'iyyat al-Jami'a al-'Arabiyya," (Cairo, 1910)
** [[Rashid Rida]], founder (N)
** secret reform society whose goal was "to promote and safeguard Arab rights." (N)
* [[Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralization]], or "Hizb al-Lamarkaziyyah al-Idariyyah al-Uthmani" (Cairo, 1912)	
* Al Ahd, "The [[Covenant Society]]" (1914)
** [['Aziz 'Ali al-Misri]], founder and Ottoman Arab officer
** supported unity between Arabs and Turks
** largely consisted of army officers, including Yasin and Taha al-Hashimi, Salim al-Jaza'iri, Ali al-Nashashibi, Salim al-Tabbakh, Mustafa Wasfi, Isma'il al-Saffar, and Nuri al-Sa'id, among others.
** supported a "call for Arab independence...respect for Islamic values...and the institution of the Caliphate." (ayyad)
* Ligue de la Patrie Arabe, "League of Arab Patriots," (1904, Paris)
** founded by Najib Azuri
** goal was to free greater [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] from Turkish domination
* [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP)
* Literary Society, "[[al-Muntada al-Adabi]]," ([[Istanbul]])
** 'Abd al-Karim al-Khalil, president
** as many as 1000 members (N)

==Background==
Jewish immigrants had begun arriving in historic Palestine before 1900.  By 1913 there was concern among Arab communities that the Zionist settlers desired to settle Arab lands at the exclusion of the Arabs.{{Citation Needed|date=August 2017}}
England and France were showing interest in the region as the two empires competed with one another for influence. Scholar David Thomas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essays on Islamic Civilization|year=1976|publisher=E. J. Brill|isbn=90-04-04464-7|pages=317–328|author=David S. Thomas|editor=Donald P. Little}}&lt;/ref&gt; contends that many of the reform groups that participated in the conference "...were more suspicious of the intentions of Britain and France in the [[Levant]] than afraid of and hostile to the [[Ottoman Porte]]..."
The Congress was held under the auspices of the [[French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref name="Tibi 1981 84" /&gt;

==Resolutions==
According to [[Rashid Khalidi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khalidi|first=Rashid|title=British Policy Towards Syria &amp; Palestine 1906-1914|year=1980|publisher=Ithaca Press London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the adopted resolutions included making Arabic "an official language in the Arab provinces...the employment of Arab troops in their home provinces except in time of war...stronger locally-controlled provincial government."
Also per Khalidi, the resolutions were sent to the [[Quai d'Orsay]].  Perhaps a reflection of their own desired autonomy, the Congress included a "declaration of solidarity with the autonomist demands of the [[Armenians]]" (page 314).

==Aftermath==
The Congress did not have a lasting effect, due in no small part to the beginning of World War I.  Many of the concerns addressed at the Congress were decided as parts of larger shifts of power during the War.
It is impossible to say what directions these proposed reforms would have taken were it not for the war, the fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]].  It is clear, however, that not only did Arabs not gain the freedoms they sought from the Ottomans, but with increased Zionist immigration, the [[Arab Revolt]] of 1936-37, and the founding of [[Israel]] in 1948, that rather the opposite came to pass.  The Arab nationalism that came about after [[World War II]] is attributable to factors such as the decline of colonial influence, rather than reforms debated back in 1913.

{{army units}}
An '''army''' (from Latin ''arma'' "arms, weapons" via Old French ''armée'', "armed" [feminine]) or '''land force''' is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. In certain states, the term army refers to the entire armed forces (e.g., People's Liberation Army). Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army.

In several countries, the army is officially called the '''Land Army''' to differentiate it from an [[air force]] called the '''Air Army''', notably [[French Air Force|France]]. In such countries, the word "army" on its own retains its connotation of a land force in common usage. The current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force]] of China with 1,600,000 active troops and 510,000 [[Military reserve force|reserve personnel]] followed by the [[Indian Army]] with 1,129,000 active troops and 960,000 reserve personnel.

By convention, [[irregular military]] is understood in contrast to [[regular army|regular armies]] which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite [[militia]]. Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. Regular military can also refer to full-time status ([[standing army]]), versus [[Military reserve force|reserve]] or part-time personnel. Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the [[National Defence Act]]), from de facto "non-statutory" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. Armies may also be [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] (designed for overseas or international deployment) or [[fencible]] (designed for – or restricted to – homeland defence)

===India===
India has had the earliest armies in the world. The first known recorded battles, the [[Battle of the Ten Kings|War of the 10 Kings]], happened when a [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Hindu Aryan]] emperor Sudas defeated an alliance of ten kings and their supportive chieftains. During the Iron Age, the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] and [[Nanda Empire|Nanda]] Empires had the largest armies in the world, the peak being approximately over 600,000 Infantry, 30,000 Cavalry, 8,000 [[Ratha|War-Chariots]] and 9,000 War Elephants not including [[tributary state]] allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Majumdar |first=Ramesh Chandra |authorlink=R.

[[War elephant|Elephants]], [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]men and [[cavalry]] were other featured troops.

In [[Rajput]] times, the main piece of equipment was iron or chain-mail armour, a round shield, either a curved blade or a straight-sword, a chakra disc and a katar dagger.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===China===
[[File:Warring States or Western Han crossbow.jpg|thumb|A bronze crossbow trigger mechanism and butt plate that were mass-produced in the [[Warring States period]] (475-221 BCE)]]
The states of China raised armies for at least 1000 years before the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]]{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. By the [[Warring States period]], the crossbow had been perfected enough to become a military secret, with bronze bolts which could pierce any armor. Thus any political power of a state rested on the armies and their organization. China underwent political consolidation of the states of [[Han (state)|Han (韓)]], [[Wei (state)|Wei (魏)]], [[Chu (state)|Chu (楚)]], [[Yan (state)|Yan (燕)]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao (趙)]] and [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi (齊)]], until by 221 BCE, [[Qin Shi Huang]] (秦始皇帝), the first emperor of the [[Qin dynasty]], attained absolute power. This first emperor of China could command the creation of a [[Terracotta Army]] to guard his tomb in the city of [[Xi'an]] (西安), as well as a realignment of the [[Great Wall of China]] to strengthen his empire against insurrection, invasion and incursion.

[[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' remains one of China's [[Seven Military Classics]], even though it is two thousand years old.&lt;ref&gt;In the twentieth c., [[Mao Zedong]] (People's Republic of China), General [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]] (Viet Nam), General [[Douglas MacArthur]] (United States),  and in medieval Japan, [[Takeda Shingen]] (1521–1573) have drawn inspiration from the work&lt;/ref&gt; Since no political figure could exist without an army, measures were taken to ensure only the most capable leaders could control the armies.&lt;ref&gt;"who wishes to fight must first count the cost" —[[Sun Tzu]], ''[[The Art of War]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scholar-bureaucrat|Civil bureaucracies (士大夫)]] arose to control the productive power of the states, and their military power.&lt;ref&gt;"You conquered the empire on horseback, but from horseback you will never succeed in ruling it." —Lu Chia, as quoted by [[Joseph Needham]], ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]''. vol 7, part II.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sparta===
The [[Spartan Army]] was one of the earliest known professional armies. Boys were sent to a [[barracks]] at the age of seven or eight to train for becoming a soldier. At the age of thirty they were released from the barracks and allowed to marry and have a family. After that, men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of 60. Unlike other civilizations, whose armies had to disband during the planting and harvest seasons, the Spartan [[serf]]s or ''[[helot]]s'', did the manual labor.

This allowed the Spartans to field a full-time army with a campaign season that lasted all year.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Spartan Army was largely composed of [[hoplite]]s, equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other. Each hoplite bore the Spartan emblem and a scarlet uniform. The main pieces of this armor were a round shield, a spear and a helmet.

===Ancient Rome===
[[File:Relief Kolumna Trajana2.jpg|thumb|A 2nd-century depiction of Roman soldiers on [[Trajan's column]]]]

The [[Roman Army]] had its origins in the citizen army of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. [[Marian Reforms|Reforms]] turned the army into a professional organization which was still largely filled by citizens, but these citizens [[career soldier|served continuously]] for 25 years before being discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knighton |first1=Andrew |title=The Roman Army – The Development Of One Of The Most Powerful Military Forces In The Ancient World |url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/ancient-history/roman-army-development-military.html |website=War History Online |accessdate=4 September 2018 |date=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans were also noted for making use of [[Auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]], non-Romans who served with the [[Roman legion|legion]]s and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as [[skirmisher|light skirmish troops]] and [[heavy cavalry]]. After their service in the army they were made citizens of Rome and then their children were citizens also. They were also given land and money to settle in Rome. In the [[Late Roman Empire]], these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman Army; moreover, by the time of the Late Roman Empire tribes such as the [[Visigoths]] were paid to serve as [[Mercenary|mercenaries]].

===Medieval Europe===
[[File:Belagerung von Calais 1346-1347.JPG|thumb|Armies of the Middle Ages consisted of noble knights, rendering service to their [[suzerain]], and hired footsoldiers]]
In the earliest [[Middle Ages]] it was the obligation of every [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment, archers, and infantry. This decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time, but could lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment and abilities. The more resources the noble had access to, the better his troops would be.

Initially, the words "knight" and "noble" were used interchangeably as there was not generally a distinction between them. While the nobility did fight upon horseback, they were also supported by lower class citizens – and mercenaries and criminals – whose only purpose was participating in warfare because, most often than not, they held brief employment during their lord's engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strong of Body, Brave and Noble: Chivalry and Society in Medieval France|last=Bouchard|first=Constance Brittain|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=0801430976|location=Ithaca|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Middle Ages progressed and [[feudalism]] developed in a legitimate social and economic system, knights started to develop into their own class with a minor caveat: they were still in debt to their lord. No longer primarily driven by economic need, the newly established vassal class were, instead, driven by fealty and [[chivalry]].

As central governments grew in power, a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the [[peasantry]] began to be the central recruiting tool. England was one of the most centralized states in the Middle Ages, and the armies that fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] were, predominantly, composed of paid professionals.

In theory, every Englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, especially one on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carruthers|first1=Bob|title=Medieval Warfare|date=2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781781592243|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the [[scutage]] was introduced, whereby most Englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army. However, almost all high medieval armies in Europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops, and there was a large [[mercenary]] market in Europe from at least the early 12th century.

As the Middle Ages progressed in Italy, Italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially in combination with standing forces, but in Italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states. This made them considerably less reliable than a standing army. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare in Italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles.

In 1439 the French legislature, known as the  [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] (French: ''états généraux''), passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone. There was a new tax to be raised known as the ''[[taille]]'' that was to provide funding for a new Royal army. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as ''[[Compagnie d'ordonnance|compagnies d'ordonnance]]'' on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors. The reforms of the 1440s,  eventually led to the [[Battle of Castillon|French victory at Castillon]] in 1453, and the conclusion of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By 1450 the companies were divided into the field army, known as the ''grande ordonnance'' and the garrison force known as the ''petite ordonnance'' .&lt;ref&gt;Vale, M.G.A. (1992). ''Charles VII''.

===Early modern===
[[File:Marignano.jpg|thumb|[[Swiss mercenaries]] and German [[Landsknechts]] fighting for glory, fame and money at the [[Battle of Marignan]] (1515). The bulk of the [[Renaissance]] armies was composed of mercenaries.]]

First [[nation state]]s lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to serve in their armies during wartime. Such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments.

The [[veteran]] soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.

As late as the 1650s, most troops were mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.

The newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state. The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the [[Fronde]] in France and the [[English Civil War]].

In many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of [[absolute monarchy]]. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions. The first state to master this process was the [[Dutch Republic]]. This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.

However, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command. Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.

As any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies. For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals.

[[File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|The colonels of the [[Gardes françaises|French Guards]] and [[Grenadier Guards|British guard]]s politely discussing who should fire first at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] (1745).&lt;ref&gt;Mackinnon, Daniel. [https://archive.org/details/originandservic03mackgoog Origin and services of the Coldstream Guards], London 1883, Vol. 1, p. 368, note 2&lt;/ref&gt; An example of "lace war".]]

It has been argued that the drawing of men from across the nation into an organized corps helped breed national unity and patriotism, and during this period the modern notion of the [[nation state]] was born. However, this would only become apparent after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. At this time, the ''[[levée en masse]]'' and [[conscription]] would become the defining paradigm of [[modern warfare]].

Before then, however, most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities. In Spain armies were recruited from all the Spanish European territories including Spain, Italy, [[Wallonia]] ([[Walloon Guards]]) and Germany. The French recruited some soldiers from Germany, Switzerland as well as from [[Piedmont]]. Britain recruited [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Hanovrian]] troops until the late 18th century. Irish Catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many Catholic European states.

Prior to the [[English Civil War]] in England, the monarch maintained a personal bodyguard of [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], or "gentlemen pensioners", and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as [[Berwick on Tweed]] or [[Portsmouth]] (or [[Calais]] before it was [[Siege of Calais (1558)|recaptured]] by France in 1558).

Troops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an ''ad hoc'' basis. [[Noblemen]] and professional regular [[soldier]]s were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops, raising their quotas by [[indenture]] from a variety of sources. On January 26, 1661 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the Royal Warrant that created the genesis of what would become the [[British Army]], although the Scottish and English Armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of England and Scotland in 1707. The small force was represented by only a few regiments.

After the [[American Revolutionary War]] the [[Continental Army]] was quickly disbanded as part of the Americans' distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the United States, with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding [[West Point]]'s arsenal. Then [[First American Regiment]] was established in 1784. However, because of continuing conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the [[Legion of the United States]], was established in 1791.

Until 1733 the common soldiers of [[Prussian Army]] consisted largely of [[peasantry]] recruited or impressed from [[Brandenburg]]–[[Prussia]], leading many to flee to neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Clark|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600–1947|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard|location=Cambridge|page=97|isbn=0-674-02385-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; To halt this trend, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] divided Prussia into [[Cantonist (Prussia)|regimental cantons]]. Every youth was required to serve as a soldier in these recruitment districts for three months each year; this met agrarian needs and added extra troops to bolster the regular ranks.&lt;ref name="Koch88"&gt;{{cite book | last= Koch |first= H.

[[File:MoshkovVI SrazhLeypcigomGRM.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Leipzig|battle of the Nations]] (1813), marked the transition between aristocratic armies and national armies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lecavalierbleu.com/images/30/extrait_81.pdf Napoléon a réinventé l’art de la guerre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230720/http://www.lecavalierbleu.com/images/30/extrait_81.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}. lecavalierbleu.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conscription|Masses]] replace hired professionals and national hatred overrides dynastic conflicts. An early example of [[total war]]s.]]

[[Russian tsar]]s before [[Peter the Great|Peter I of Russia]] maintained professional hereditary musketeer corps ([[streltsy]] in Russian) that were highly unreliable and undisciplined. In times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants. Peter I introduced a [[Imperial Russian Army|modern regular army]] built on German model, but with a new aspect: officers not necessarily from [[nobility]], as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officer's rank. Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system, per settlement. Initially it was based on the number of households, later it was based on the population numbers.&lt;ref name=blum&gt;Jerome Blum (1971) "Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century", {{ISBN|0-691-00764-0}}, pp. 465, 466&lt;/ref&gt; The term of service in the 18th century was for life. In 1793 it was reduced to 25 years. In 1834 it was reduced to 20 years plus 5 years in reserve and in 1855 to 12 years plus 3 years of reserve.&lt;ref name=blum/&gt;{{Chronology citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- I have seen different dates for these changes --&gt;

The first [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[standing army]] were [[Janissaries]]. They replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors (''[[Ghazw|ghazi]]s'') whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted. The first Janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves, probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army's booty in kind rather than cash.

From the 1380s onwards, their ranks were filled under the ''[[devşirme]]'' system, where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan. The "recruits" were mostly Christian youths, reminiscent of [[mamluk]]s.

China organized the [[Manchu people]] into the [[Eight Banner system]] in the early 17th century. Defected [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] armies formed the [[Green Standard Army]]. These troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service.

===Late modern===

[[Conscription]] allowed the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] to form the ''[[La Grande Armée]]'', what [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called "the nation in arms", which successfully battled European professional armies.

Conscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.

Canada also had a political dispute over conscription during World War II. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.

In developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.

Russia, as well as many other nations, retains mainly a conscript army. There is also a very rare ''citizen army'' as used in Switzerland (see [[Military of Switzerland]]).

==Armies as armed services==
Western armies are usually subdivided as follows:
*'''[[Corps]]''': A corps usually consists of two or more divisions and is commanded by a [[lieutenant general]].
*'''[[Division (military)|Division]]''': Each division is commanded by a [[major general]], and usually holds three brigades including infantry, artillery, engineers and communications units in addition to [[logistics]] (supply and service) support to sustain independent action. Except for the divisions operating in the mountains, divisions have at least one armored unit, some have even more depending upon their functionality. The basic building block of all ground force combat formations is the infantry division.
*'''[[Brigade]]''': A brigade is under the command of a [[brigadier]] or [[brigadier general]] and sometimes is commanded by a [[colonel]]. It typically comprises three or more battalions of different units depending on its functionality. An independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit, an infantry unit, an armour unit and logistics to support its actions. Such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps.
*'''[[Battalion]]''': Each battalion is commanded by a [[colonel]] or sometimes by [[lieutenant colonel]] who commands roughly 500 to 750 soldiers. This number varies depending on the functionality of the regiment. A battalion comprises 3–5 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] (3 rifle companies, a fire support company and headquarters company) or its functional equivalent such as batteries (artillery) or squadrons (armour and cavalry), each under the command of a [[major]]. The company can be divided into platoons, each of which can again be divided into sections or squads. (Terminology is nationality and even unit specific.)&lt;ref name="definitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/pk%5Eard.html |title=Subdivisions of the army |accessdate=2007-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116031246/http://www.fotw.net/flags/pk%5Eard.html |archivedate=2006-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field army==
A [[field army]] is composed of a headquarters, army [[troops]], a variable number of [[corps]], typically between three and four, and a variable number of [[Division (military)|divisions]], also between three and four. A battle is influenced at the Field Army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point. Field armies are controlled by a General or Lieutenant General.

===Formations===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[2nd Armored Division (United States)]] --&gt;
[[File:Army Nato.svg|thumb|Standard map symbol for a numbered Army, the 'X's are not substituting the army's number]]

A particular army can be named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general. For example, the [[First United States Army]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. In the [[British Army]] it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division).

Armies (as well as [[army group]]s and [[Theater (military)|theater]]s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.

In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]], "Armies" could vary in size, but were subordinate to an [[Army Group]]-sized "[[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]" in wartime. In peacetime, a [[Army (Soviet Army)|Soviet army]] was usually subordinate to a [[military district]]. [[Viktor Suvorov]]'s ''Inside the Soviet Army'' describes how [[Cold War]] era Soviet military districts were actually composed of a front headquarters and a military district headquarters co-located for administration and [[Military deception|deception]] ('maskirovika') reasons.

'''Briga''' (''Fight'' or ''Struggle'' in [[Galician language]]) is a [[Galician nationalist|Galician independentist]] political organization formed by young people in 2004 as a split of the [[Assembleia da Mocidade Independentista]].&lt;ref name="herrikolore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herrikolore.org/index.php/mundua/35/4668-briga-10-anos-de-lucha-juvenil-por-la-independencia-el-socialismo-y-el-feminismo-en-galiza|title=Briga: 10 años de lucha juvenil por la independencia, el socialismo y el feminismo  en Galiza &amp;#124; HerriKolore|publisher=herrikolore.org|accessdate=2014-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the youth wing of the political party [[Nós–Unidade Popular]] and defines itself as a [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Feminism|anti-patriarcal]], [[Ecologism|ecologist]], anti-authoritarian, [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]&lt;ref name="briga-galiza"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://briga-galiza.info/briga/quem-somos/|title=Quem somos?|publisher=briga-galiza.info|accessdate=2014-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; organization. It also defends social monolingualism and linguistic [[reintegrationism]] in [[Galiza]]. Briga has [[AGIR (student organization)|AGIR]] as its reference{{clarify|date=June 2018}} in student unionism.

==History==
Briga was created in 2004 after a split in the [[Assembleia da Mocidade Independentista]] (AMI) between the supporters of remaining an independent youth organization and the supporters of becoming the [[youth wing]] of [[Nós–Unidade Popular]], which eventually left [[Assembleia da Mocidade Independentista|AMI]].

In May 2005, three Briga militants were arrested for an attempt to remove a statue of the [[Francoism|fascist]] military commander [[José Millán Astray|Millán Astray]] in [[A Coruña]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.primeiralinha.org/destaques6/astray.htm&lt;/ref&gt; At the same year the organization was almost banned when it was accused of supporting violence. Five Briga militants were arrested by the [[Spanish police]] and accused of unlawful association. They were later acquitted and the organization was fully legalized. Later in the same year, the police arrested again three Briga militants who were accused of hitting a cop during a [[Street protest|demonstration]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vieiros.com/nova/59092/piden-cinco-anos-de-cadea-para-tres-persoas-por-bater-na-policia-un-1-de-maio&lt;/ref&gt;

During the following years, Briga made numerous campaigns for such reasons as denouncing speculation, defending the Galician language, and protesting low wages for youth. One of the most important was the campaign in 2008 to paint a [[political mural]] each of the 366 days of that year, a goal that was finally reached.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I42l0ywaUI&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source |reason=Is Youtube the best/only source for this? |date=June 2018}} In 2009 during a Briga demonstration in [[Santiago de Compostela]], the police charged against the demonstrators, which left several Briga militants wounded and sparked riots in the Old Quarter of the [[Santiago de Compostela|city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://old.kaosenlared.net/noticia/galiza-mobilizacom-da-jornada-rebeliom-juvenil-09-carga-policial |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007082528/http://old.kaosenlared.net/noticia/galiza-mobilizacom-da-jornada-rebeliom-juvenil-09-carga-policial |archive-date=2015-10-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 and 2011 the police again broke up the traditional demonstrations of Briga on the 24th of July (the day before the [[Día Nacional de Galicia]]) in [[Santiago de Compostela]].&lt;ref&gt;http://esculca.gal/sites/default/files/pdf/Dossier24-25Xullo.pdf{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucS5i6Zfk0w&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8403">'''Breira''' (full name "Breira: A Project of Concern in Diaspora-Israel Relations") was an organization founded to express a left-wing position on [[Israel]].  Formed in 1973, it lasted until 1977.

==History==
Breira dissented from what it saw as the hard line Jewish organizational perspective that said there is no alternative in the aftermath of the [[Yom Kippur War]].  The group took the Hebrew name Breira—meaning "alternative"—in response to the cry of ''ein breira'', or "there is no alternative."

In 1973, Rabbi [[Arnold Jacob Wolf]] served as founding chair of the movement. In its first public statement, Breira called for Israel to make territorial concessions and recognize the legitimacy of the national aspirations of the [[Palestinian people]] in order to achieve lasting peace. David Tuilin was the vice-president, Inge Gibel was the treasurer. Rabbi Gerald Sirotta was an active member.  As its national chairman, Wolf stated that the name signified, "our desire for an alternative to the intransigence of both the PLO and the several governments of Israel."  The group proposed a two state solution.&lt;ref name=Staub&gt;{{cite book|last=Staub|first=Michael E.|title=Torn at the Roots: the Crisis of Jewish Liberalism in Postwar America|year=2002|publisher=Columbia Univ. Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0231123744|pages=280–281, 290}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
That year, Breira became a national membership organization of over one hundred Reform and Conservative rabbis and a number of important American Jewish writers and intellectuals, including [[Steven M. Cohen]], [[Paul Cowan (American journalist)|Paul Cowan]], [[Arthur Green]], [[Irving Howe]], [[Paula Hyman]], [[Jack Nusan Porter]], [[Henry Schwarzschild]], [[John S. Ruskay]], and [[Milton Viorst]].  Jewish counter-culture youths also helped to found Breira.&lt;ref name="jss"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=4466953 | title=An Interpretation of the Jewish Counterculture | author=Glantz, David | journal=Jewish Social Studies, | year=1977 | volume= 39 | issue=1/2 | pages=117–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael E. Staub states, "Breira survived four tumultuous years.  Its proposals on Israeli-Diaspora Jewish relations and [[Palestinian nationalism]] generated fierce international debate over the limits of public dissent and conflict in Jewish communal life, and virtually every major American Jewish organization took a public stand on the group and what it advocated."&lt;ref name=Staub /&gt;

There was an overlap of leadership with [[Americans for Progressive Israel]]. A full list of members was published in ''The National Jewish Post &amp; Opinion'', August 9, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/why-breira/ Why Breira?]&lt;/ref&gt;  They published a journal called ''Interchange''.

==Controversy==
In July 1976, [[Spiro Agnew]]'s organization, Education for Democracy, labeled them dangerous and "anti-Israel",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30816F7355E1A738DDDA90B94DF405B868BF1D3 | work=The New York Times | first=Mary | last=Breasted | title=AGNEW-LED GROUP SCORED BY RABBI; A Second Jewish Leader Also Assails Newsletter | date=July 30, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;  even as Agnew himself was being accused of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0611F6395F167493C6AB178ED85F428785F9 | work=The New York Times | first=William | last=Safire | title=Spiro Agnew and the Jews; ESSAY | date=May 24, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1976, they agreed to meet with the PLO. Wolf stipulated that they meet as private individuals and that it be understood that they were not involved in any political negotiations. The initiative was supported by Jewish intellectuals [[Nathan Glazer]] and [[Irving Howe]]. Meeting representatives included Rabbi Max Ticktin and [[Arthur Waskow]] representing Breira, and the [[American Jewish Congress]], [[B'nai B'rith]], and the [[National Council of Jewish Women]].  Waskow wrote a widely circulated opinion piece about speaking to the PLO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40A1EFB355B1A7B93C2AA1789D95F428785F9 | work=The New York Times | first=Bernard | last=Gwertzman | title=American Jewish Leaders Are Split Over Issue of Meeting With P.L.O.; American Jewish Leaders Split On Issue of Meeting With P.L.O. | date=December 30, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in December 1976, the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' ran a story portraying the organization as supporting terrorists, whereupon many members left the group. On February 20, 1977, when Breira held its first national membership conference in Chevy Chase, Maryland, the convention was attacked by [[Jewish Defense League]] members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2535786 | title=The Breira Conference | doi=10.2307/2535786 | volume=6 | work=Journal of Palestine Studies| date=1977 | pages=147–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1977, the Rabbinical Assembly of [[Conservative Judaism]] blocked two members of Breira, Wolf and Rabbi [[Everett Gendler]], from membership in the organization's executive council. The RA felt that the organization was giving aid to Israel's enemies.  At that time, according to the ''New York Times'' article, Breira had 1500 members.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50614FC3A5D167493C4A9178ED85F438785F9 | work=The New York Times | first=George | last=Vescey | title=RABBINICAL MEETING REJECTS 2 NOMINEES; Unusual Action by Assembly Comes in Wake of a Harsh Debate Over Alternate Israel Policies | date=May 6, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaiah L. Kenen]], the former [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] executive director, while still serving as the editor of its ''Near East Report'', helped to label the group as  "anti-Israel", "pro-PLO", and "[[self-hating Jews]]". Kenen charged that Breira "undermined U.S. support for Israel". Rabbi [[Alexander Schindler]], president of the [[Union of American Hebrew Congregations]], was the only major leader of a Jewish organization to defend Breira.  He called the attack on Breira a "witch hunt".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Foer, ''The War against Breira'', Jewish Spectator, Summer, 1983, p.21. Article based on author's unpublished undergraduate thesis at Hampshire College, ''The Attack on Breira: Dissent and Repression in the Jewish Community'', from interviews with former Breira leaders Arthur Samuelson, Rabbi Balfour Brickner, and Rabbi Arnold Wolf, who confirm many of Foer’s facts. Cited in Edward Tivnan, ''The Lobby: Jewish Political Power and American Foreign Policy'', p.93 ff&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book, ''The Lobby: Jewish Political Power and American Foreign Policy'', Edward Tivnan observed, "By attacking Breira, Jewish leaders had turned over much of their power to AIPAC, Israel's most loyal agent in the U.S. and a proved enemy of dissent from Israeli policies, among Jews as well as gentiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrmea.org/wrmea-archives/141-washington-report-archives-1988-1993/july-1992/10030-the-secret-section-in-israels-us-lobby-that-stifles-american-debate.html |title=The AIPAC Politics of Smear: The Secret Section in Israel's U.S. Lobby That Stifles American Debate |first=Gregory D. |last=Slabodkin |work=[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]] |date=July 1992 |accessdate=December 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, '''''coffeeshops''''' are establishments where the sale of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for personal consumption by the public is tolerated by the local authorities.

Under the [[drug policy of the Netherlands]], the sale of cannabis products in small quantities is allowed by licensed ''coffeeshops''. The majority of these also serve drinks and food. ''Coffeeshops'' are not allowed to serve alcohol or other drugs, and risk closure if they are found to be selling soft drugs to minors, [[hard drugs]] or selling [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]]. The idea of licensing the sale of cannabis was introduced in the 1970s for the explicit purpose of keeping hard and soft drugs separated.

In the Netherlands, 105 of the 443 municipalities have at least one ''coffeeshop''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

A Dutch judge has ruled that tourists can legally be banned from entering cannabis cafes, as part of restrictions that were implemented in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17865663 |title=Dutch cannabis cafe owners fight changes |work=[[BBC News]]|date=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; City councils can choose whether to implement this ban or not. This ban is only implemented by a few municipalities in the southern Netherlands.

The city council in [[Maastricht]] allows tourists to visit coffeeshops, but all except one have made a voluntary agreement to only allow locals, local residents being defined as anyone living within a 150km radius (local people from Belgium and Germany are still allowed). The ban is not enforced in the city of [[Amsterdam]] and most other parts of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/are-tourists-allowed-in-dutch-coffeeshops-the-strange-tale-of-the&lt;/ref&gt;

A Dutch coffeehouse not serving cannabis is called a ''koffiehuis'' or ''café'', though the latter term can also refer to a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]].

==''Coffeeshop'' law==
{{See also|Drug policy of the Netherlands}}
In the Netherlands, the selling of marijuana is "illegal, but not punishable", so the law is not enforced in establishments following these nationwide rules:

* No advertising
* No hard drug sales on the premises
* No sales to anyone under the age of 18
* No sale of quantities greater than five grams
* No public disturbances
&lt;!-- before adding here, ask yourself whether your info doesn't belong in [[Drug policy of the Netherlands]]. This section describes the experience of coffeehouses as establishments, without going into all the ins-and-outs of drug policy --&gt;

For some offenses, a business may be forced to close for three to six months; for others, the business may be closed permanently. All these rules are detailed in official policies.

''Coffeeshops'' are no longer allowed to sell alcohol. Most ''coffeeshops'' advertise, and the constraint is more moderating than outright prohibitive. In a gesture of discretion still technically required, many ''coffeeshops'' keep the cannabis menu below the counter, even when the cannabis itself is in more-or-less plain view. Dutch ''coffeeshops'' often fly green-yellow-red [[Flag of Ethiopia|Ethiopian flags]], other symbols of the [[Rastafari movement]], or depiction of palm leaves to indicate that they sell cannabis, as a consequence of the official ban on direct advertising. This aesthetic attracts many public artists who may be paid to create murals in the ''coffeeshops'' and use the Rastafari and [[reggae]] related imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coffeeshop Info|url=http://www.coffeeshopibiza.com/#!coffeeshop-info/c1h6a|website=coffeeshopibiza|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backdoor policy==
There is an ongoing contradiction, as a ''coffeeshop'' is allowed to buy and sell cannabis within the legally tolerated limits, but its suppliers are not allowed to grow or import it, or to sell it to the ''coffeeshop'': "The front door is open, but the backdoor is illegal." There are proposals for remedying this situation (as of January 2006), e.g. by controlled growing of cannabis to replace imports. One proponent of this is [[Gerd Leers]], [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Minister for Immigration and Asylum Affairs]], who, when in national parliament, was in favour of further criminalisation of cannabis, in keeping with the policies of his party, [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]], which is the strongest opponent of the [[drugs policy of the Netherlands]]. When confronted with the practical difficulties when he became mayor (and consequently head of police) he changed his mind and even became the best known advocate against the illegality at the back door, which takes up a disproportionate amount of time and money for the police, in tracking down (mostly indoor) plantations.

===Wiettop===
In 2008, the ''Vereniging van Nederlandse Gemeenten'' (VNG, the organisation of Dutch municipalities) organised a ''wiettop'' ("weed summit", a wordplay on the flowery tops that cannabis is made of), attended by 33 Dutch mayors from both big and small municipalities and various political parties. Reasons for the summit were drugs tourism in border regions (the mayors of [[Roosendaal]] and [[Bergen op Zoom]] had just announced an intention to close all ''coffeeshops''), the strong link with illegality (including laundering of money through ''coffeeshops'') and the discrepancies between the policies of the various municipalities. At this wiettop, all mayors agreed that regulation of the 'backdoor' was desirable. [[Rob van Gijzel]], mayor of [[Eindhoven]] announced he intended to start a 'monitored pilot' of issuing licenses for the production of cannabis. But near the borders, the front door should also be (better) regulated, forbidding sales to foreigners. This would also greatly decrease the demand at the backdoor. Intentions were to discuss the results of the wiettop with the national government before the end of 2008. As of 2014, this discussion is still ongoing. A majority of mayors and users have extended the wish to allow some form of regulated, legal, cultivation for sale to the ''coffeeshops'' as this would lower the crime/violence rate, solve the backdoor issue and can generate some income. However, liberal minister Ivo Opstelten has blocked any such proposals so far and has refused to investigate it altogether. The mayors are still trying to force the minister to at least investigate the situation and allow a pilot to be conducted.

===Survey===
In a survey among mayors by ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' at the time of the wiettop (with a 60% response) 80% of the mayors were in favour of 'regulating the backdoor' (i.e. making it legal). However, only 18% were in favour of making the market for soft drugs completely free. 22% were in favour of reducing the number of ''coffeeshops'' and 10% want to close them all. Strikingly, this has little to do with the view of their political party, from which NRC Handelsblad concludes it is based on practical considerations, rather than ideological.

==Required distance from schools==
In 2008, the Dutch government decided that ''coffeeshops'' would no longer be allowed within a radius of 250 m of schools. In [[Amsterdam]], this means the closing of 43 more ''coffeeshops'' (in preceding years the number had already been reduced from 350 to 228). Mayor [[Job Cohen]] had preferred no change but complied reluctantly. He pointed out that ''coffeeshops'' are already not allowed to sell to customers aged under 18, so the policy would not have much effect.

Toward the end of 2013, Amsterdam mayor Eberhard van der Laan said that in 2014, some of the ''coffeeshops'' near schools will be forced to close.  There was some discussion on whether they will have to completely close or only during school hours, being able to conduct business after 18:00 and on weekends, should this become law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amsterdam Coffee Shop News 2014|url=http://www.amsterdam.info/coffee-shop-news/|publisher=Amsterdam.info|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug tourism==
Each municipality has a ''coffeeshop'' policy. Some do not allow any; most of these municipalities are either controlled by strict [[Protestant]] parties, or are bordering Belgium and Germany and do not wish to receive "[[drug tourism]]" from those countries. A 19 March 2005 article in the Observer noted that the number of Dutch cannabis ''coffeeshops'' had dropped from 1,500 to 750 over the previous five years, largely due to pressure from the conservative coalition government. The "no-growth" policies of many Dutch cities affect new licensing. This policy slowly reduces the number of ''coffeeshops'', since no one can open a new one after a closure. Most municipalities have designated a certain zone (e.g. around schools and high schools) where ''coffeeshops'' are not allowed, which may be from a hundred metres to several kilometres.

The municipality of [[Terneuzen]] has put up road signs showing the way to the ''coffeeshops'' and decided to restrict local by-laws for cannabis from May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/fr/articles/news/Dutch-border-towns-close-coffee_shops.html |title=Dutch border towns close coffee-shops Expactica, 24 October 2008 |publisher=Expatica.com |date= |accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Maastricht]] the ''coffeeshops'' are forbidden for foreign tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/16/maastricht-marijuana-tourism-eu | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Leigh | last=Phillips | title=Maastricht ban on tourists in marijuana cafes upheld by EU court | date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A controversial measure to introduce a ''wietpas'' (Dutch) or "weed-pass" membership system — pushed primarily by Christian political parties within the Dutch coalition government – has been proposed; this pass would restrict ''coffeeshop'' cannabis sales to residents of the Netherlands with a membership card only. The ban for foreign tourists started in three southern provinces on 1 May, and is due to go nationwide by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17865151 | work=BBC News | title=Netherlands judge backs cafe cannabis ban | date=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/no-weed-pass-no-cannabis-dutch-tell-foreigners-2160631.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Jerome | last=Taylor | date=15 December 2010 | title=No weed pass, no cannabis, Dutch tell foreigners}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite strong protests from ''coffeeshop'' owners, a judge in the Netherlands has upheld a new law to ban foreign tourists from entering cannabis cafes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17865151 | work=BBC News | title=Netherlands judge backs cafe cannabis ban | date=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers representing the ''coffeeshop'' owners have promised to appeal the ruling, and protests are continuing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coffeeshopnieuws.nl/4-20-2012-smokeout&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities do have some form of control, for example ''coffeeshops'' in the city of Amsterdam still sell to foreigners without any discrimination or extra demands/limitations.

===Smoking on the premises===
[[Cannabis smoking|Smoking joints]] has been common in cannabis ''coffeeshops''. Since 1 July 2008 there is a [[List of smoking bans#Netherlands|tobacco smoking ban]] in the Netherlands which prohibits smoking tobacco in all hotels, restaurants and cafés. Therefore, it is now illegal to [[Cannabis smoking#Mixing with tobacco and other herbs|smoke joints containing tobacco]] in ''coffeeshops''. Although bongs and pure cannabis joints can still be smoked inside the premises,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsterdamlogue.com/amsterdams-2008-no-smoking-law-and-you.html|title=Amsterdam’s 2008 no-smoking law and you|date=|publisher=Amsterdamlogue.com|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; smoking cigarettes or joints containing tobacco is only allowed in a separate smoking room. Most ''coffeeshops'' still sell mixed joints/spliffs, i.e. those with tobacco mixed with cannabis, and have made customers smoke in upstairs or downstairs rooms.

{{Environmental law}}
'''Drainage law''' is a specific area of [[water law]] related to [[drainage]] of [[surface water]] on [[real property]]. It is particularly important in areas where [[freshwater]] is scarce, [[flooding]] is common, or water is in high demand for [[Agriculture|agricultural]] or [[Commerce|commercial]] purposes.

==In the United States==

In the [[United States]], regulation of drainage is typically done on the [[U.S. state|state]] and [[Local government in the United States|local]] level. In addition to whatever [[statute]]s or [[local ordinance]]s may be in effect in a given locality, there are three basic legal doctrines which the various [[State court (United States)|state courts]] recognize.&lt;ref name=Cole&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Daniel H.|title=Liability Rules for Surface Water Drainage: A Simple Economic Analysis |journal=George Mason University Law Review|year=1989|volume=12|issue=1|pages=35-55 |url=https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/facpub/862/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of [[Michigan]], drainage law is so important that [[County (United States)|counties]] elect a [[drain commissioner]] to oversee water resources.

===Common enemy doctrine===
The common enemy doctrine is a rule derived from [[English law|English]] [[common law]].  It holds that since surface water is a "common enemy" to landowners, each landowner has the right to alter the drainage pattern of his land (for example by building [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] or [[Ditch|drainage channels]]) without regard for the effects on neighboring parcels, as long as that water flows to where it otherwise would have naturally flowed.  Typically, a landowner can capture surface water (e.g. by [[rain barrel]]s or [[dam]]s) as well, and lower landowners will not have a [[cause of action]] unless the diversion is malicious.&lt;ref name="BarBri"&gt;[[BarBri]] Real Property Outline 2004, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;  This rule is followed by approximately half the U.S. states, although some states have modified the doctrine to hold landowners liable for [[Negligence|negligent]] damage to the parcels belonging to neighboring landowners.

===Civil law rule===
The civil law rule (so named because it is derived from the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law systems]] of [[France]] and [[Spain]]) is effectively the opposite of the common enemy doctrine. It holds that the owner of a lower parcel of land must accept the natural drainage from those parcels above his, and cannot alter the drainage pattern of his own land to increase the drainage flow onto parcels lower than his own.  For this reason, this rule is sometimes referred to as the "natural flow rule".

Application of the civil law rule in its purest form would inhibit the development of land, since virtually every [[Land improvement|improvement]] on a parcel would alter the natural drainage.  For this reason, this rule has been modified in those jurisdictions that use it, to permit reasonable changes in natural flow, often weighing the competing interests of neighboring landholders with the benefit of the development of the parcel.

===Reasonable use rule===
The reasonable use rule presents an alternative to both the common enemy doctrine and the civil law rule. It allows a landowner to make "reasonable" alteration to the drainage pattern of his parcel, with liability only occurring when the alteration causes "unreasonable" harm toward neighboring parcels. Judicial mitigation of the common enemy doctrine and civil law rule often results in an approximation of the reasonable use rule.&lt;ref name="BarBri"/&gt;

Because the reasonable use rule presents a subjective standard, courts will often employ a [[balancing test]] to determine whether a landowner is liable to neighbors for alteration of drainage. For example, under the [[Restatement of Torts]], the test was:

# Was there reasonable necessity for the property owner to alter the drainage to make use of their land?
# Was the alteration done in a reasonable manner?
# Does the utility of the actor’s conduct reasonably outweigh the gravity of harm to others?

==In the United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] the Land Drainage Act 1991 decrees drainage of land in England and Wales, but does not cover sewerage and water supplies but the actual process of draining land itself. The act defines who is responsible for various aspects of land drainage and the different areas in which the law applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/59/contents |publisher=The National Archives |title=Land Drainage Act 1991 |deadurl=no |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Esperanto flag - construction.svg|thumbnail|Esperanto flag with proportions]]
Since the earliest days of [[Esperanto]], the colour [[green]] has been used as a symbol of mutual recognition, and it appears prominently in all '''Esperanto symbols'''.

The ''Verda Stelo'' ({{lang-en|Green Star}}) was first proposed in an 1892 article in ''La Esperantisto'' for use as a symbol of mutual recognition among [[Esperantist]]s.

In a letter to ''The British Esperantist'' in 1911, [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the creator of Esperanto, wrote: "It seems to me, that my attention was drawn to the color green by Mr. [[Richard H. Geoghegan]] and from that time I began to publish all of my works with green covers . . .  Looking at one of my pamphlets that I had entirely by chance printed with a green cover, he pointed out that this was the color of his homeland, Ireland; at that time it came to me, that we could certainly look at that color as a symbol of HOPE. About the five-pointed star, it seems to me, that at first Mr. [[Louis de Beaufront|de Beaufront]] had it imprinted on his grammar [of Esperanto]. I liked that and I adopted it as a symbol. Afterward by association of ideas, the star appeared with a green color."

The Esperanto [[flag]] is composed of a green background with a white square ([[Canton (flag)|canton]]) in the upper lefthand corner, which in turn contains a green star. The green field symbolizes [[hope]], the white symbolizes [[peace]] and neutrality, and the [[five-pointed star]] represents the five [[continent]]s ([[Europe]], [[Americas|America]], [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], [[Africa]]). The [[flag]] was created by the Esperanto Club of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], initially for their own use, but was adopted as the flag of the worldwide Esperanto movement by a decision of the first [[World Esperanto Congress]], which took place in 1905 in that town.

By recommendation of the board of the [[Universal Esperanto Association]], the flag should have the following proportions: The ratio of the width of the flag to the height of the flag to a side of the white square should be 3 to 2 to 1. The ratio of a side of the white square to the radius of a circle enclosing the star should be 10 to 3.5.&lt;ref&gt;[[:eo:Esperanta Flago]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Esperanto speakers consider the traditional flag too [[nationalism|nationalistic]] for an international [[language]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} so many organizations no longer recommend its use and, instead, use the [[jubilea simbolo]] (''jubilee symbol'', two green "[[E]]"s facing each other—or alternatively a Latin-alphabet "E" facing a Cyrillic-alphabet "Э", the first letter of "Эсперанто", the Russian name for Esperanto—on a white field). This symbol was created in 1987 by a [[Brazil]]ian Esperantist to mark the centenary of the creation of Esperanto. On the other hand, this new symbol is derogatively called "the melon" ({{lang-eo|la melono}}) by some.

Most Esperantists, however, continue to hold the ''verda stelo'' dear as a symbol of international or supranational solidarity, and regard the preference of one symbol over another as a purely personal choice. At most Esperanto congresses, all three main symbols can be seen in use on displays or being worn as badges.

Sometimes, Esperanto travelers will display the flag, wear a badge with one of the above symbols, or even wear green clothes, to make themselves known to other Esperanto speakers.

==Flag variants==

In 1905, delegates to the first conference of Esperantists at Boulogne-sur-Mer, unanimously approved a version, differing from the modern only by the superimposition of an "E" over the green star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/qy-eo.html# |accessdate=September 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831015356/http://www.fotw.net/flags/qy-eo.html#vars |archivedate=August 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other variants include that for Christian Esperantists, with a white Christian cross superimposed upon the green star, and that for Leftists, with the color of the field changed from green to red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/qy-eo.html#vars |accessdate=September 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831015356/http://www.fotw.net/flags/qy-eo.html#vars |archivedate=August 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==

On December 15, 2009, the Esperanto flag flew on the [[Google]] home search page "Google" logo to mark [[L. L. Zamenhof]]'s 150th birthday. The flagstaff was the "L" of the [[Web search engine|search]]-company name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/doodles/150th-birthday-of-ll-zamenhof 150th Birthday of LL Zamenhof.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
One hypothesis of the [[red star]] as a symbol of socialism relates to an alleged encounter between [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Nikolai Krylenko]]. Krylenko, an [[Esperantist]], was wearing a green-star lapel badge; Trotsky enquired as to its meaning and received an explanation that each arm of the star represented one of the five traditional continents. On hearing this, he specified that a similar red star should be worn by soldiers of the [[Red Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/ny2/ts/stelo.html Pri La Stelo: Militista simbolo]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katherine "Flossie" Bailey''' (1895–February 6, 1952) was a civil rights and anti-lynching activist from Indiana. She established a local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] in [[Marion, Indiana|Marion]], Indiana, in 1918 and became especially active fighting for justice and equality following the double lynching of [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Thomas Shipp]] and [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Abram Smith]] in 1930. As president of the Indiana NAACP, Bailey was pivotal in lobbying for passage of a statewide [[Lynching in the United States#State laws|anti-lynching law]] in Indiana in 1931 and advocated for a similar bill at the national level. She was also a recipient of the national NAACP's [[Madam C. J. Walker]] Medal.

==Early life and education==
Katherine Harvey, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Harvey, was born in [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]], Indiana, in 1895. Known as "Flossie", she grew up in Kokomo and attended [[Kokomo High School]].&lt;ref name="Obit (1952)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Flossie K. Bailey |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2239512/mrs_flossie_k_bailey_the_kokomo/ |accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=''The Kokomo Tribune''|date=11 February 1952|location=Kokomo, Indiana|page=27|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IN200-10&gt;James H.

==Marriage and family==
Flossie married Walter T. Bailey, a physician, in 1917. The couple resided in [[Marion, Indiana|Marion]], Indiana.&lt;ref name=IN200-10/&gt; Doctor Bailey died on February 10, 1950.&lt;ref name="W.T. obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colored Circles: 'Friends have received word...' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2239881/the_kokomo_tribune_kokomo_indiana_11/|accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=''The Kokomo Tribune''|date=11 February 1950|location=Kokomo, Indiana|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their only surviving child was a son, named Walter Charles Bailey.&lt;ref name=IN200-10/&gt;

While living in Marion, Bailey also became actively involved in the Marion community. She was a member of the city's Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church congregation.&lt;ref name="Obit (1952)"/&gt;

==Career==
Bailey spent her adult life seeking equality and justice as a civil rights activist. In 1918 Bailey established the Marion branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). Initially it did not receive much support. In June 1930 it had 96 members; however, after the Marion community was the site of a [[lynching]] in August 1930, the local chapter's membership increase to 155 members by the end of 1930.&lt;ref name=Traces24/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James H. Madison |year=2001 |title=A Lynching in the Heartland: Race and Memory in America |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave |isbn=9781403961211 |pages=58–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IN200-11&gt;Madison, "Katherine 'Flossie' Bailey" in ''Indiana's 200'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 1930, a mob broke into the [[Grant County, Indiana|Grant County]], Indiana, jail in Marion, dragged two African American men, [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Thomas Shipp]] and [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Abram Smith]], to the Courthouse Square and lynched (hanged) them from a tree. Bailey, who was the president of the local branch of the NAACP, tried to obtain police protection for the jailed men prior to the lynching. Afterwards, she was actively involved in organizing a [[Hoosier]] delegation of NAACP members to speak to Indiana governor [[Harry Leslie]] and persuade him to intervene in the investigation of the men's murders.&lt;ref name=IN200-11/&gt;

Bailey and a number of others worked hard to obtain a fair investigation into the double lynching. Despite objections from those in the Marion community who wanted to forget about the event, Bailey and the NAACP played an important role in seeking justice for the murders of Shipp and Smith, as well as to restore calm in Marion. Two men were indicted and went on trial for the lynching, but neither one was found guilty of the crime and no one was ever punished for the deaths of Shipp and Smith.&lt;ref name=IN200-11/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madison_2000-23-25"&gt;Madison, "Flossie Bailey," ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Bailey was elected president of the Indiana NAACP and helped plan its second annual meeting. The Bailey home in Marion became the Indiana headquarters for the NAACP.&lt;ref name=IN200-11/&gt; The national organization recognized Bailey's efforts by awarding her the [[Madam C. J. Walker]] Medal for "the person who has done the best work in the NAACP during the year."&lt;ref name="Madison_2000-25"&gt;Madison, "Flossie Bailey", ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey worked to ensure nothing like the lynching in Marion would occur again. She lobbied the [[Indiana General Assembly]] to pass stricter anti-lynching laws. When opponents to the bill rejected many of the safety measures, Bailey organized a statewide effort, calling on chapters of the NAACP, Optimist Clubs, Exchange Clubs, and Democratic organizations to lobby state legislators. Bailey's efforts were successful and the governor signed a stricter anti-lynching law in March 1931. Once the Indiana bill became law, Bailey began lobbying for a national anti-lynching law, as well as for the fair treatment of African Americans in other sectors of American life. Bailey especially focused on fighting to end the segregation of schools, hospitals, and other public spaces such as movie theaters.&lt;ref name="Madison_2000-25-26"&gt;Madison, "Flossie Bailey", ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Bailey and the NAACP struggled during the years of the [[Great Depression]]. Her husband, who suffered a stroke, closed his medical practice in Marion around 1940, and the couple moved to Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=IN200-12&gt;Madison, "Katherine 'Flossie' Bailey" in ''Indiana's 200'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Bailey died in Indianapolis on February 6, 1952.&lt;ref name="Obit (1952)" /&gt; As an activist and president of the Indiana NAACP in the 1930s, her leadership helped establish a foundation for the civil rights movement of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=IN200-12/&gt;

{{Progressivism sidebar|expanded=Ideas}}

'''Freedom of movement''', '''mobility rights''', or the '''right to travel''' is a [[human rights]] concept encompassing the right of individuals to travel from place to place within the [[territory]] of a [[country]],&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;Jérémiee Gilbert, ''Nomadic Peoples and Human Rights'' (2014), p. 73: "Freedom of movement within a country encompasses both the right to travel freely within the territory of the State and the right to relocate oneself and to choose one's place of residence".&lt;/ref&gt; and to leave the country and return to it. The right  includes not only visiting places, but changing the place where the individual resides or works.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GGC"&gt;Kees Groenendijk, Elspeth Guild, and Sergio Carrera, ''Illiberal Liberal States: Immigration, Citizenship and Integration in the EU'' (2013), p. 206: "[F]reedom of movement did not only amount to the right to travel freely, to take up residence and to work, but also involved the enjoyment of a legal status characterised by security of residence, the right to family reunification and the right to be treated equally with nationals".&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a right is provided in the [[constitution]]s of numerous [[State (polity)|states]], and in documents reflecting norms of [[international law]]. For example, Article 13 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] asserts that:
* a [[citizen]] of a state in which that citizen is present has the liberty to travel, reside in, and/or work in any part of the state where one pleases within the limits of respect for the liberty and rights of others,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Postema| first = Gerald| title = Racism and the law: the legacy and lessons of Plessy| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| year = 1997| page = 48| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9Bth9OCy5VUC&amp;pg=PA48| isbn = 978-0-7923-4665-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* and that a citizen also has the right to leave any country, including his or her own, and to return to his or her country at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people and organizations advocate an extension of the freedom of movement to include a freedom of movement – or migration – between the countries as well as within the countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Libertarians say: Let the immigrant children in|url = https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarians-say-let-the-immigrant-children-in|accessdate = 2015-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2012/1/cj32n1-2.pdf|title = Why Should We Restrict Immigration?|date = |accessdate = 14 September 2015|website = Open Borders|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom of movement is restricted in a variety of ways by various governments and may even vary within the territory of a single country.&lt;ref name="Gilbert" /&gt; Such restrictions are generally based on public health, order, or safety justifications and postulate that the right to these conditions preempts the notion of freedom of movement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Common Restrictions==
Restrictions on international travel on people (immigration or emigration) are commonplace.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Dowty, Alan. ''Closed Borders: the Contemporary Assault on Freedom of Movement''. Yale University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Within countries, freedom of travel is often more limited for minors, and [[penal law]] can modify this right as it applies to persons charged with or convicted of crimes (for instance, [[parole]], [[probation]], registration).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bauböck, R. (2009). Global Justice, Freedom of Movement and Democratic Citizenship. ''European Journal of Sociology,50''(01), 1. doi:10.1017/s000397560900040x&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, freedom of movement has historically been limited for women, and for members of disfavored racial and social groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Circumstances, both legal and practical, may operate to limit this freedom. For example, a nation that is generally permissive with respect to travel may restrict that right during time of [[war]].

Restrictions may include the following:

* national and regional official minimum wage tariff barriers to labour-market entry (free movement or migration of workers);
* official [[identity cards]] (internal passports, citizenship licenses) that must be carried and produced on demand;
* obligations on persons to register changes of address or of partner with the state authorities;
* protectionist local/regional barriers to housebuilding and therefore settlement in particular districts;
* trespassing into another individual's property.

===Freedom of movement between private properties===
In some jurisdictions, questions have arisen as to the extent to which a private owner of land can exclude certain persons from land used for public purposes, such as a [[shopping mall]] or a [[park]]. There is also a rule of law that a landowner whose property is completely boxed in by that of other private landowners shall have the right to cross private land if that is necessary to reach a public thoroughfare. The concept is also used as the basis for enacting laws to prevent alternate use of streets, roads and right-of-ways from blocking or restricting freedom of movement such as block parties and playing basketball.

There is a converse duty for a private person not to impede the free movement of another. Where a person prevents another from freely leaving an area, either by physically imprisoning them or by threats, that person may be subject to a [[lawsuit]] for [[false imprisonment]], and to criminal charges for [[kidnapping]].

[[Parent]]s or other [[legal guardian]]s are typically able to restrict the movements of minor children under their care, and of other adults who have been legally deemed incompetent to govern their own movement. Employers may legally set some restrictions on the movements of employees, and terminate employment if those restrictions are breached.

===Domestic restrictions===
Governments may generally sharply restrict the freedom of movement of persons who have been convicted of crimes, most conspicuously in the context of imprisonment. Restrictions may also be placed on convicted criminals who are on [[probation]] or have been released on [[parole]]. Persons who have been charged with crimes and have been released on bail may also be prohibited from traveling. A [[material witness]] may also be denied the right to travel.

Governments sometimes also restrict access to disaster-stricken areas, or to places where public health threats exist. Where an individual presents a health threat due to infection with a contagious disease, the government may [[quarantine]] that person, restricting their movement for the safety of others.

Though travelling to and from countries is generally permitted (with some limitations), most governments restrict the length of time that temporary visitors may stay in the country. This can be dependent on country of citizenship and country travelled to among other factors. In some instances (such as those of [[Refugee|refugees]] who are at risk of immediate bodily harm on return to their country or those seeking legal asylum), indefinite stay may be allowed on [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] grounds, but in most other cases, stay is generally limited. One notable exception to this is the [[Schengen Area]], where citizens of any country in the EU generally enjoy indefinite stay in other EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Abolition of International Border Checks in an Enlarged Schengen Area|last=Faure Atger|first=Anais|publisher=EU Framework Program|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, restrictions on the right to relocate or live in certain areas of a country have been imposed in several countries, most prominently China.&lt;ref name="movement1" /&gt;

In a [[child custody]] dispute, a court may place restrictions on the movement of a minor child, thereby restricting the ability of the parents of that child to travel with their child.

===Entrance restrictions in certain countries===
[[File:Stanstead-toilet-door-with-Home-Office-warning-1883.jpg|thumb|British Government asks travelers arriving at [[London Stansted Airport]] not to destroy their travel documents, in order to be able to adjudicate their eligibility to enter the country]]
{{Main|Illegal immigration}}
The [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]] ranks countries based on the number of other countries its citizens are free to enter without visa. Most countries in the world require visas or some other form of entrance permit for non-citizens to enter their territory. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Those who enter countries in defiance of regulations requiring such documentation are often subject to imprisonment or deportation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Eileen, D. (2016). Freedom of Movement. ''Diplomatic Law''. doi:10.1093/law/9780198703969.003.0024&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exit restrictions in certain countries===
{{Main|Illegal emigration}}

Most countries require that their citizens leave the country on a valid passport, travel document issued by an international organization or, in some cases, identification document. Conditions of issuance and the governments' authority to deny issuance of a passport vary from country to country.

Under certain circumstances, countries may issue travel documents (such as [[Laissez-Passer|laissez-passer]]) to aliens, that is, to persons other than their own citizens.

Having a passport issued does not guarantee the right to exit the country. A person may be prohibited to exit a country on a number of reasons, such as being under investigation as a suspect, serving a criminal sentence, being a debtor in default, or posing a threat to national security. This applies to aliens as well.

In some countries prohibition to leave may take the form of revocation of a previously issued passport. For example, the [[United States of America]] may revoke passports at will.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Haig v. Agee]], [[s:Passport Act of 1926|Passport Act of 1926]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries, such as the former [[Soviet Union]], further required that their citizens, and sometimes foreign travelers, obtain an [[exit visa]] to be allowed to leave the country.

Currently, some countries require that foreign citizens have valid visas upon leaving the country if they needed one to enter. For example, a person who overstayed a visa in [[Czech Republic]] may need to obtain an exit visa. In [[Russia]], the inconvenience goes even further as the legislation there does not formally recognize residency permits as valid visas; thus, foreign citizens lawfully residing in Russia need to obtain "exit-entry" visas in order to do a trip abroad. This, in particular, affects foreign students, whose original entry visas expire by the time they return home.

Citizens of the [[People's Republic of China]] who are residents of the [[mainland China|mainland]] are required to apply for [[Two-way Permit|exit and entry endorsements]] in order to enter the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] (and SAR residents require a [[Home Return Permit]] to visit the mainland). Since 2016, residents of the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] have been required to deposit their passports with the police. Each trip abroad must be approved by the government, which is more difficult for members of the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-38093370|title=China confiscates passports of Xinjiang people|date=2016-11-24 |publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Europe ===
When [[Augustus]] established the [[Roman Empire]] in 27 BC, he assumed monarchical powers over the new Roman province of [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Egypt]] and was able to prohibit [[Roman Senate|senators]] from traveling there without his permission. However, Augustus would also allow more liberty to travel at times.  During a [[famine]] in 6 AD, he attempted to relieve strain on the food supply by granting senators the liberty to leave [[Rome]] and to travel to wherever they wished.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', Book LV, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], in 1215, the right to travel was enshrined in Article 42 of the [[Magna Carta]]:

:It shall be lawful to any person, for the future, to go out of our kingdom, and to return, safely and securely, by land or by water, saving his allegiance to us, unless it be in time of war, for some short space, for the common good of the kingdom: excepting prisoners and outlaws, according to the laws of the land, and of the people of the nation at war against us, and Merchants who shall be treated as it is said above.

In the Holy Roman Empire, a measure instituted by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1781 had permitted [[serfs]] freedom of movement. The serfs of Russia were not given their personal freedom until [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]'s Edict of Emancipation of 1861. At the time, most of the inhabitants of Russia, not only the serfs but also townsmen and merchants, were deprived of freedom of movement and confined to their places of residence.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15340.html Pale of Settlement]"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations Declaration ===
After the end of hostilities in [[World War II]], the [[United Nations]] was established on October 24, 1945.  The new international organization recognized the importance of freedom of movement through documents such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966).  Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, reads,
 
:[[File:Universal Declaration of Human Rights - eng - ks.ogg|thumb|The text of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.]](1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State.
:(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.

Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights incorporates this right into treaty law:

:(1) Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.
:(2) Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own.
:(3) The above-mentioned rights shall not be subject to any restrictions except those provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other rights recognized in the present Covenant.
:(4) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country.

The ICCPR entered into force for the initial ratifying states on 23 March 1976, and for additional states following their ratification.  In 1999, the U.N. Human Rights Committee, which is charged with interpreting the treaty, issued its guidelines for Article 12 of the ICCPR in its "General Comment No. 27: Freedom of Movement".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

While the treaty sets out the freedom of movement in broad and absolute terms, part four of Article 12 of the ICCPR admits that these freedoms may be restricted for a variety of reasons in the public interest. This clause is often cited to justify a wide variety of movement restrictions by almost every country that is party to it.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

As a part of the [[one country, two systems]] policy proposed by [[Deng Xiaoping]] and accepted by the British and Portuguese governments, the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative regions]] (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau retained separate border control and immigration policies with the rest of the PRC.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Chinese nationals had to gain permission from the government before travelling to Hong Kong or Macau, but this requirement was officially abolished for each SAR after its respective handover.

* Freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India though reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interest of the general public, for example, restrictions may be imposed on movement and travelling, so as to control epidemics.

# Every individual shall have the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of a State provided he abides by the law.
# Every individual shall have the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his country. This right may only be subject to restrictions, provided for by law for the protection of national security, law and order, public health or morality. 
# Every individual shall have the right, when persecuted, to seek and obtain asylum in other countries in accordance with laws of those countries and international conventions.
# A non-national legally admitted in a territory of a State Party to the present Charter, may only be expelled from it by virtue of a decision taken in accordance with the law.
# The mass expulsion of non-nationals shall be prohibited. Mass expulsion shall be that which is aimed at national, racial, ethnic or religious groups.
The ideals of the Charter are, in principle, supported by all signatory governments, though they are not rigorously followed. There have been attempts to have intellectuals recognized as having special freedom of movement rights, to protect their intellectual ideals as they cross national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/africa/KAMDOK.htm|title=The Kampala Declaration on Intellectual Freedom and Social Responsibility (1990)|author=|date=|website=www1.umn.edu|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the  African Charter on Human and People's Rights, the [[Constitution of South Africa]] also contains express freedoms of movement, in section 21 of [[Constitution of South Africa Chapter 2: Bill of Rights|Chapter 2]].  Freedom of movement is guaranteed to "everyone" in regard to leaving the country but is limited to citizens when entering it or staying in it.  Citizens also have a right to a [[passport]], critical to full exercise of the freedom of movement internationally.&lt;ref&gt;''Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996'' [http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1996/26.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[1996] ZACC 26&lt;/nowiki&gt;], 1996 (4) SA 744, 1996 (10) BCLR 1253 (6 September 1996), [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] (South Africa)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Europe ===

==== European Union ====
{{Main|Four Freedoms (European Union)}}
[[File:European Union as a single entity.png|thumb|European Union Freedom-of-Movement Area]]
Within the [[European Union]], residents are guaranteed the right to freely move within the EU's internal borders by the [[EC Treaty|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] and the European Parliament and Council [[Directive 2004/38/EC]] of 29 April 2004.&lt;ref name="movement2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33152.htm|title=EUROPA|publisher=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66hn8NNel?url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33152.htm|archivedate=5 April 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=23 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Union residents are given the right to enter any member state for up to three months with a valid passport or identity card. If the citizen does not have a travel document, the member state must afford them every facility in obtaining the documents. Under no circumstances can an entry or exit visa be required. There are some security limitations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l23010.htm|title=EUROPA|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518023429/http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l23010.htm|archive-date=18 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and public policy restrictions on extended stays by EU residents. For instance, a member state may require that persons register their presence in the country "within a reasonable and non-discriminatory period of time". In general, however, the burden of notification and justification lies with the state. EU citizens also earn a right to permanent residence in member states they have maintained an uninterrupted five-year period of legal residence. This residency cannot be subject to any conditions, and is lost only by two successive years absence from the host nation. Family members of EU residents, in general, also acquire the same freedom of travel rights as the resident they accompany, though they may be subject to a short-stay visa requirement.&lt;ref name="movement2" /&gt; Furthermore, no EU citizen may be declared permanently ''[[persona non grata]]'' within the European Union, or permanently excluded from entry by any member state.

===== Workers =====
{{Main|Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union}}

The freedom of movement for workers is a policy chapter of the [[Acquis|acquis communautaire]] of the [[European Union]]. It is part of the [[free movement of persons]] and one of the [[Internal market|four economic freedoms]]: [[free movement of goods]], [[Free movement of services|services]], [[Free movement of labour|labour]] and [[Free movement of capital|capital]]. Article 45 [[TFEU]] (ex 39 and 48) states that:

# Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Community.
# Such freedom of movement shall entail the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment.
# It shall entail the right, subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health:
#: (a) to accept offers of employment actually made;
#: (b) to move freely within the territory of Member States for this purpose;
#: (c) to stay in a Member State for the purpose of employment in accordance with the provisions governing the employment of nationals of that State laid down by law, regulation or administrative action;
#: (d) to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State, subject to conditions which shall be embodied in implementing regulations to be drawn up by the Commission.
# The provisions of this article shall not apply to employment in the public service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12002E/htm/C_2002325EN.003301.html Treaty of Rome] (consolidated version). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ireland ====
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Thirteenth Amendment]] was adopted in November 1992 by [[referendum]] in order to ensure freedom of movement in the specific circumstance of a woman traveling abroad to receive an [[abortion]]. However, with the successful repeal of the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]] of the [[Constitution_of_Ireland|Irish Constitution]] on the 25th of May 2018, which ensures the right to an abortion, this previous amendment is no longer necessary.

==== Italy ====
In [[Italy]], freedom of movement is enshrined in Article 16 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]], which states:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|title=The Italian Constitution|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf|archivedate=2016-11-27|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Every citizen has the right to reside and travel freely in any part of the country, except for such general limitations as may be established by law for reasons of health or security. No restriction may be imposed for political reasons. Every citizen is free to leave the territory of the republic and return to it, notwithstanding any legal obligations."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Europe map svalbard.png|thumb|The Svalbard area is an entirely visa-free zone.]]

==== Norway (Svalbard) ====
Uniquely, the [[Norway|Norwegian]] special territory of [[Svalbard]] is an [[Visa policy of Svalbard|entirely visa-free zone]] under the terms of the [[Svalbard Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sophia|first=Yakhlef,|last2=Goran|first2=Basic,|last3=Malin|first3=Åkerström,|date=2015|title=Project Turnstone : Freedom of Movement and Passenger Experiences with Safety and Border Control in the Baltic Sea Area|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:877568&amp;dswid=-8481|journal=DIVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Poland ====
Polish nationals holding dual citizenship that despite Poland's joining of the [[Schengen Area]], they are obliged to use Polish travel documents (a Polish passport or, within the European Union, a [[Polish identity card|Polish National ID card (Dowód osobisty)]], or they will not be allowed to leave Poland by the Polish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sieps.hemsida.eu/sites/default/files/35-20065.pdf|title=Freedom of Movement for Workers from Central and Eastern Europe|last=Doyle|first=Nicola|date=2006|website=SIEPS|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest such incident is recorded as of January 4, 2012.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Poland requires Polish citizens including foreign citizens who are or can be claimed or those who can be suspected to be Polish citizens to enter and depart Poland using a Polish passport.&lt;ref&gt;Szmagalska-Follis, K. Int J Polit Cult Soc (2009) 22: 385. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10767-009-9073-9&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
The [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]] in article 27 states that "1. Everyone who is lawfully in the territory of the Russian Federation has the right to freely move and choose a place of stay or living. 2. Everyone may freely exit the territory of the Russian Federation. [Every] citizen of the Russian Federation may return onto the territory of the Russian Federation without hindrance."

Freedom of movement of Russian citizens around the country is legally limited in a number of situations, including the following:
* In [[closed city|closed cities]] (mainly nuclear research centers) and border-adjacent areas. Special permits are necessary for both visiting and settling there.
* In [[Border Security Zone of Russia|certain areas]] near Russia's international border.
* Emergency or quarantine areas.
* In the interests of justice (imprisonment, bailiff's order, arrest, undertaking not to leave during a criminal investigation etc.).
* Conscription.

Since the abandonment of [[propiska in the Soviet Union|propiska]] system in 1993, new legislation on registration was passed. Unlike propiska which was a permit to reside in a certain area, registration as worded in the law is merely notification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubins|first1=Noah|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/hilj39&amp;div=16&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=The Demise and Resurrection of the Propiska: Freedom of Movement in the Russian Federation|journal=[[Harvard International Law Journal]]|date=1998|volume=39|issue=2|pages=545-566}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, administrative procedures developed "in implementation" of the registration law imposed such conditions on registration which effectively made it depending on the landlord's assent. As landlords, for various reasons, are not interested to register tenants or guests in their properties, many of internal migrants are prevented from executing their legal duty to register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katanian|first1=Konstantin|title=The Propiska and the Constitutional Court Special Report|journal=East European Constitutional Review|date=1998|volume=7|page=52|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/eeurcr7&amp;div=20&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2004, it was common for police to fine those having failed to register within 3 working days at a place of stay. In 2004, the maximum permitted registration lag was raised to 90 days thus making such a prosecution practically infeasible. Thus now there are no obstacles to movement of citizens per se. Nevertheless, since registration is the primary source of one's address for legal purposes, many internal migrants still are de facto [[second-class citizen]]s deprived of their right to [[elections|vote]], obtain a [[passport]] or [[driver's license]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1x-4CwAAQBAJ|title=Fragile Migration Rights: Freedom of Movement in Post-Soviet Russia|last=Light|first=Matthew|date=2016-03-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317631217}}{{Page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian citizens' right to leave Russia may be legally suspended on a number of reasons including:
* Person's having had access to classified documents while working for the state or the military, for the time when access is granted and up to 5 years afterwards. This limitation is included as a provision in job contract.
* In the interests of justice (imprisonment, bailiff's order, undertaking not to leave etc.).
* If the person is subject to conscription.

Russia does not recognize (though doesn't forbid) dual citizenship. Russian citizens possessing foreign citizenship may not enter or leave Russia on foreign travel documents. Russian citizens living abroad may get stuck in Russia if they need to obtain a passport while on visit to Russia; the legal term for issuance of a passport may be up to 4 months under some circumstances. Russian consular offices do not grant visas to foreign passport holders who are (or are suspected to be) Russian citizens.

==== United Kingdom ====
Britons have long enjoyed a comparatively high level of freedom of movement. Apart from [[Magna Carta]], the protection of rights and liberties in this field has tended to come from the [[common law]] rather than formal [[Constitution|constitutional codes and conventions]], and can be changed by Parliament without the protection of being [[Entrenchment clause|entrenched]] in a constitution.

It has been proposed that a range of specific state restrictions on freedom of movement should be prohibited under a new or comprehensively amended [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The new basic legal prohibitions could include: road tolls and other curbs on freedom of travel and private vehicle ownership and use; personal identity cards (internal passports, citizenship licenses) that must be produced on demand for individuals to access public services and facilities; and legal requirements for citizens to register changes of address or partner with the state authorities.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;“The Legal Protection Of Democracy &amp; Freedom: The Case For A New Written Constitution &amp; Bill Of Rights", in Lewis F. Abbott, ''British Democracy: Its Restoration &amp; Extension,'' ISR/Google Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-31-7}}.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
The [[Constitution of Canada]] contains mobility rights expressly in [[Section Six of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 6]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].  The rights specified include the right of citizens to leave and enter the country and the right of both citizens and [[permanent residency|permanent residents]] to move within its boundaries.  However, the subsections protect poorer regions' [[affirmative action]] programs that favour residents who have lived in the region for longer.  Section 6 mobility rights are among the select rights that cannot be limited by the Charter's [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]].

Canada's [[Social Union Framework Agreement]], an agreement between governments made in 1999, affirms that "All governments believe that the freedom of movement of Canadians to pursue opportunities anywhere in Canada is an essential element of Canadian citizenship."  In the Agreement, it is pledged that "Governments will ensure that no new barriers to mobility are created in new social policy initiatives."&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada, Social Union, News Release, "[http://socialunion.gc.ca/news/020499_e.html A Framework to Improve the Social Union for Canadians:  An Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Governments of the Provinces and Territories, February 4, 1999]," URL accessed 20 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States ====
{{main|Freedom of movement under United States law}}Freedom of movement under [[United States law]] is governed primarily by the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] which states, "The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States." As far back as the [[United States circuit court|circuit court]] ruling in ''[[Corfield v. Coryell]],'' [[case citation|6 Fed. Cas. 546]] (1823), freedom of movement has been judicially recognized as a fundamental Constitutional right. In ''[[Paul v. Virginia]],'' 75 U.S. 168 (1869), the Court defined freedom of movement as "right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=75&amp;invol=168|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|author=|date=|website=Findlaw|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] did not invest the federal government with the authority to protect freedom of movement.  Under the "privileges and immunities" clause, this authority was given to the states, a position the Court held consistently through the years in cases such as ''[[Ward v. Maryland]],'' 79 U.S. 418 (1871), the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]],'' 83 U.S. 36 (1873) and ''[[United States v. Harris]],'' 106 U.S. 629 (1883).&lt;ref name="Symposium1"&gt;Duster, Michael J.

Internationally,  § 215 of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] (currently [[Codification (law)|codified]] at [[Title 8 of the United States Code|8 U.S.C.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1185 § 1185]), it is unlawful for a United States citizen to enter or exit the United States without a valid United States passport.&lt;ref&gt;Capassakis, Evelyn (1981).

===Oceania===

==== Australia ====
No federal Australian legislation guarantees freedom of movement within the Commonwealth of [[Australia]].  Various Australian laws restrict the right on various grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/HumanRights/PublicSectorGuidanceSheets/Pages/Righttofreedomofmovement.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317002728/http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/HumanRights/PublicSectorGuidanceSheets/Pages/Righttofreedomofmovement.aspx |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }} - No longer Active
&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1 July 2016, [[Norfolk Island]] had immigration controls separate from those of the remainder of Australia and a permit was required for Australian citizens or residents to enter. In August 2014 the Australian [[Commonwealth Government]] proposed regulating the rights of Australian citizens to travel to and from designated areas associated with [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Freeland''' is an [[unincorporated community]] and [[census-designated place]] (CDP) on [[Whidbey Island]] in [[Island County, Washington|Island County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 2,045.&lt;ref name="Census 2010"&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US5325510| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001): Freeland CDP, Washington| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| accessdate=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town received its name based on its origins as a [[socialism|socialist]] [[commune]] in the early 1900s: in the eyes of its founders, the land of the town was literally to be free for all people. Some of the first settlers were veterans of a prior experiment in socialism, the nearby [[Equality Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Pierce LeWarne, ''Utopias on Puget Sound, 1885&amp;ndash;1915'', Seattle, University of Washington State Press, 1975; pp. 114-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Freeland is located on the southern part of Whidbey Island at {{coord|48|0|56|N|122|32|1|W|type:city}} (48.015556, -122.533622).&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community sits on a mile-wide [[isthmus]] between the south end of Holmes Harbor, a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} inlet of [[Saratoga Passage]], and Mutiny Bay on [[Admiralty Inlet]].

The '''International Centre for Reconciliation''' (or '''ICR''') was based at [[Coventry Cathedral]], UK, and was established in 1940 after the destruction of the cathedral in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Website for the ICR - http://www.coventrycathedral.org.uk/about-us/our-reconciliation-ministry.php&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than seek revenge for the devastation caused, the centre's founders vowed to promote reconciliation in areas of conflict. This began in the former [[Communist bloc]], but has since broadened to focus on the conflict between the three major monotheistic faiths. In 2008, the ICR ceased to exist as an individual entity, and its work was taken on more closely by Coventry Cathedral under the Coventry Cathedral Reconciliation Ministry banner.

It was"committed to reconciliation in various situations of violent conflict, some related to religious dispute and others fuelled by different factors".

The ICR also co-ordinated the Community of the Cross of Nails,&lt;ref&gt;Website of the Community of the Cross of Nails - http://www.crossofnails.org&lt;/ref&gt; which is an international network of 150 organisations in 60 countries. All of these organisations aim for reconciliation, providing the ICR with a support base throughout the world. The centre has "formal partnerships" with the Anglican Diocese of [[Kaduna]] in [[Nigeria]] and the [[Syriac Orthodox]] Diocese of [[Jerusalem]].

==Directors of International Ministry==

This person in this position leads the ICR.

* The Revd. Canon [[Andrew White (clergyman)|Andrew White]], Co-Director (1998-2004)
* The Revd. Canon [[Justin Welby]], Co-Director and Canon Residentiary (2002-2004)
* Martin Hayward, Director of ICR (2004-2008)
* Canon David Porter, Director and Canon Residentiary (2008-2014)
* Dr Rev Canon Dr Sarah Hills MBChB MA PhD (2014)

White moved on to become vicar of St George's Church, [[Baghdad]] (Iraq) in 2005. St George's is the only Anglican church in Iraq.

Welby became Sub-Dean and Canon for Reconciliation Ministry at Coventry Cathedral in 2005; moved to become [[Dean of Liverpool]] as of December 2007 and Bishop of Durham as of November 2011. He was consecrated as the [[List of Archbishops of Canterbury|105th Archbishop of Canterbury]] in March 2013.

The '''International (States) Parliament for Safety and Peace''' (IPSP or ISPSP; {{lang-it|Parlamento Mondiale (degli Stati) per la Sicurezza e la Pace}}), sometimes written along with the designation '''New Society of Nations''', is a private organization based in [[Palermo]], Italy, whose stated intention is the promotion of security and peace.&lt;ref name=Bosbeke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sicily/&gt;  Its founder and president was Palermo-native Vittorio Maria Busa (1941–2013), self-styled as Viktor Ivan Busà, who also claimed the titles of [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] and [[archbishop]] of [[Białystok]], president of the [[Republic of Danzig]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Belarus]], and [[Grand Khan]] of [[Tartary]] and [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref name=Bosbeke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eco/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curieux/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stair/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rita/&gt; Since the death of Busa in 2013 the organization's websites were closed. In 2015 "officials" of IPSP met a [[Jordan]]ian house speaker&lt;ref name=Petra/&gt; and a Syrian government minister.&lt;ref&gt;https://sana.sy/en/?p=30466&lt;/ref&gt;

==International relations and personal associations==
The International Parliament for Safety and Peace claims recognition under the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] (1961) and the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]] (1963).&lt;ref name=European/&gt;&lt;ref name=West/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vitality/&gt; It had an observer in attendance at the 13th meeting of the Technical Preparatory Committee of the Whole of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] in [[Addis Abeba]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=Nijhoff/&gt; IPSP joined the [[United Nations Global Compact]] campaign in 2010 as a global non-governmental organization with 1400 employees, but was delisted the next year for a "failure to comply with Integrity Measures".&lt;ref name=Global/&gt; In 2015, [[Atef Tarawneh]], the [[List of Speakers of the Chamber of Deputies of Jordan|Speaker of Jordan's Lower House]] received representatives of the Parliament for Safety and Peace for a meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.petra.gov.jo/Public_News/Nws_NewsDetails.aspx?lang=2&amp;site_id=1&amp;NewsID=182885&amp;Type=P|title=House Speaker receives Vice President of International Parliament for Safety and Peace|work=petra.gov.jo|agency=Jordan News Agency (Petra)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signed an agreement.&lt;ref name=Petra&gt;{{cite news|url=http://petra.gov.jo/Public_News/Nws_NewsDetails.aspx?lang=2&amp;site_id=1&amp;NewsID=190360&amp;Type=P|title=Lower House, International Parliament ink cooperation agreement|agency=Jordan News Agency (Petra)|work=petra.gov.jo|quote=Lower House Speaker [[Atef Tarawneh]] and Vice President of the International Parliament for Safety and Peace (IPSP) Alfredo Maiolese on Wednesday signed an agreement to enable the House to cooperate with other parliaments signatory with the IPSP.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPSP claims association with many dignitaries in senator, deputy, and executive positions in its global, regional or local chapters. Columnist Steve Blow of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' has referred to such positions as [[wikt:bodacious|bodacious]] credentials.&lt;ref name=Blow/&gt; Columnist [[Bernard Levin]] of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote in 1994 that one could join the Parliament for just $140.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; IPSP reportedly awards titles of nobility&lt;ref name=Ezell/&gt; and hands out medals for artistic merit and the pursuit of peace. Among the "senators for life" are [[president of the Gambia|president of the]] [[Gambia]] [[Yahya Jammeh]],&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Echo/&gt; African-American entrepreneur [[Charles Steele, Jr.]],&lt;ref name=Basin/&gt; and [[Kochi]]n-[[India]]n vocalist [[K.

Reports suggest that the birth of an intersex infant can be regarded as a curse or bad omen, resulting in infanticide, neglect, and the stigmatization of the mother.&lt;ref name="kaggwa2016id" /&gt; Mothers may even be expelled from their community, and intersex children may be separated from siblings.&lt;ref name="sipd2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cschrcl" /&gt;

Intersex persons may experience coercive medical interventions, in medical settings and outside medical settings.

A 2014 Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law report identified multiple cases where surgeries and medical interventions led to human rights abuses. In one case, surgery conducted by medical practitioners without family consent led to the child having health problems and dropping out of school.&lt;ref name="cschrcl"&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law| last2 = Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum| last3 = Rainbow Health Foundation| last4 = Sexual Minorities Uganda| last5 = Support Initiative for Persons with Congenital Disorders| author4-link = Sexual Minorities Uganda| title = Uganda Report of Violations based on Sex Determination, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation| date = 2014| url = http://www.hrapf.org/publications/research-papers/uganda-report-violations-based-sex-determination-gender-identity-and| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150503012642/http://www.hrapf.org/publications/research-papers/uganda-report-violations-based-sex-determination-gender-identity-and| archivedate = 2015-05-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, a child was abandoned at hospital after genital surgery because of the cost of treatment. The hospital discontinued his treatment.&lt;ref name="cschrcl" /&gt;

Sam Lyomoki, a Ugandan MP and a doctor, has stated that the parliament "issued guidelines in 2015 to the Ministry of Health advising against surgical intervention for intersex infants", however, "Local radio stations in Uganda buzz with appeals seeking donors to help fund genital reshaping surgery abroad" and surgeries are also carried out within Uganda.&lt;ref name="kakande2016" /&gt; Local organization SIPD Uganda "advocates for the 'best guess' non-surgical approach where an intersex child should be raised in the best-suited gender, without irreversible surgical intervention, until they can be active participants in the decision".&lt;ref name="kakande2016"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.trust.org/item/20161218060443-tqfr4/ | title = In Uganda, parents seek controversial genital surgery for 'intersex' babies | first = Yasin | last = Kakande | work = [[Thomson Reuters Foundation]] News | date = December 18, 2016 | accessdate = 2017-05-15 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161221004250/http://news.trust.org/item/20161218060443-tqfr4 | archivedate = December 21, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection from discrimination==

{{legend|#0066FF|Explicit protection on grounds of intersex status}}
{{legend|#9FCFFF|Explicit protection on grounds of intersex within attribute of sex}}]]
{{main|Discrimination against intersex people}}
The constitution of Uganda provides for recognition of fundamental rights and freedoms, equality and non-discrimination, privacy, education and affirmative action.&lt;ref name="sipd2016" /&gt; The African Charter on the rights and welfare of the African child commits member countries, including Uganda, to the protection of all children – including intersex children – against social, economic, cultural and political abuse and exploitation.&lt;ref name="sipd2016" /&gt; In practice, intersex persons remain subject to violence, discrimination and abuse.&lt;ref name="kaggwa2016gu"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0261-3077| last = Kaggwa| first = Julius| title = I'm an intersex Ugandan – life has never felt more dangerous| work = [[The Guardian]]| accessdate = 2017-05-13| date = September 16, 2016| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/intersex-ugandan-lgbt-gay-rights-life-never-felt-more-dangerous| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170309004148/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/intersex-ugandan-lgbt-gay-rights-life-never-felt-more-dangerous| archivedate = March 9, 2017| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In research by SIPD Uganda, 90% of intersex youth reported that they were forced to drop out of school because of the immense stigma and discrimination associated with the non-binary development of their intersex body."&lt;ref name="sipd2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ippf.org/stories/growing-intersex-uganda | title = Growing up intersex in Uganda | work = [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] | accessdate = 2017-05-15 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170614122846/http://www.ippf.org/stories/growing-intersex-uganda | archivedate = 2017-06-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification documents==
{{main|Legal recognition of intersex people}}
The Registration of Persons Act 2015 allows for the registration of a child born a "hermaphrodite", and for change of name and change of sex classification. The recommendation of a medical clinician is required. Changes of name can create social problems, and the situation of adults is uncertain.&lt;ref name="reg2015"&gt;{{Cite| last = Parliament of Uganda| title = Registration of Persons Act| date = 2015| url = http://www.ulii.org/ug/legislation/act/2015/4-6| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170501145417/http://www.ulii.org/ug/legislation/act/2015/4-6| archivedate = 2017-05-01| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sipd2016" /&gt; Many intersex persons are understood to be stateless due to historical difficulties in obtaining identification documents.&lt;ref name="sipd2016" /&gt;

== Rights advocacy==
SIPD Uganda has called for recognition of the human rights of intersex people in Uganda, and in the East African region, including protection from harmful surgeries, access to care, protection from discrimination and abuse, and access to education and employment. SIPD Uganda has worked with some 700 intersex persons in the 25 Ugandan administrative districts where it delivers services.&lt;ref name="Scope2014" /&gt; The organization also convened a 2014 regional meeting of intersex advocates allies from Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Congo, Tanzania, and Uganda.&lt;ref name="sipd2016" /&gt;

Intersex is commonly confused with being lesbian or gay, and this has consequences for organizing and disclosure, as well as discrimination towards intersex persons. [[Julius Kaggwa]], the executive director of SIPD, describes the situation in Uganda as dangerous.&lt;ref name="kaggwa2016gu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julius-kaggwa/uganda-lgbti-rights_b_1821740.html |title=Life's No Play, But Certain Characters' Voices Are Heard Loud and Clear in Uganda |last1=Kaggwa |first1=Julius |date=August 24, 2012 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher=The World Post |access-date=2015-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924233819/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julius-kaggwa/uganda-lgbti-rights_b_1821740.html |archivedate=September 24, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julius-kaggwa/ugandan-anti-homosexualit_b_463810.html |title=Ugandan Anti-Homosexuality Bill Doubly Endangers LGBT Community and Human Rights Activists |last1=Kaggwa |first1=Julius |date=April 18, 2010 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher=The World Post |access-date=2015-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924233821/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julius-kaggwa/ugandan-anti-homosexualit_b_463810.html |archivedate=September 24, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39053828 | title = Becoming Julius: Growing up intersex in Uganda | date = February 26, 2017 | work = [[BBC News]] | accessdate = 2017-05-15 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170524225801/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39053828 | archivedate = May 24, 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ladlad''' (English: "[[Coming out|come out]]," lit. "The Unfurled") or the '''LGBT Party''' is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) political party.  It was founded on September 21, 2003 by [[Danton Remoto]].

The party's official motto is ''Bukas puso, bukas isip.'' (Open heart, open mind.)&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladlad.org/?page_id=2 |title= About LADLAD |year=2010 |publisher=LADLAD |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platform==
The organization's thrust is toward [[human rights]], and the organization is fighting for equal rights among all Filipinos, whether they are LGBT or not.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Controversies==
The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] denied Ladlad's petition to be allowed to run in the 2010 elections, on the grounds of "immorality",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHR backs Ladlad in Comelec row |newspaper=ABS-CBN News |date=November 15, 2009 |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/15/09/chr-backs-ang-ladlad-comelec-row |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on January 12, 2010, the Supreme Court granted a [[Injunction#Temporary restraints|temporary restraining order]], thereby allowing Ladlad to participate in the 2010 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/01/12/10/supreme-court-issues-tro-ang-ladlad |title=Supreme Court issues TRO for Ladlad |first=Purple |last=Romero |work=ABS-CBNNews.com/Newsbreak |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Philippine general election, 2007|2007 elections]], Ladlad was previously disqualified for failing to prove they had nationwide membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20070301-52263/Gay_party-list_group_Ladlad_out_of_the_race |title=Gay party-list group Ladlad out of the race |first=Jerome |last=Aning |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926163623/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20070301-52263/Gay_party-list_group_Ladlad_out_of_the_race |archivedate=September 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 2010, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] formally allowed Ladlad to join the elections. The party received 113,187 votes or 0.37% (excluding votes from [[Lanao del Sur]]), below the optional 2% threshold and was not able to win a seat in Congress.

Due to the 2013 Elections, where Ladlad wasn't able to get a seat in Congress, the party under the same name is barred from the 2016 elections. The party can enter elections in 2019 instead.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Low Popularity Dilemma==
The party's low popularity due to the country's opposing influential Catholic figures is seen as the major walls in Ladlad's congressional bid. In a foreign research study, 10% of the population can be accounted as part of the LGBT community, if generalized.{{according to whom|date=April 2016}}

In usage of the generalization, 10% of the 50 million voting Filipinos can be accounted as part of the LGBT community, most of which are influenced by traditional Catholic teachings.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Modernization has lessened the percentage of Filipinos tracking traditional Catholic teachings and more LGBT Filipinos are coming out of the closet as noted by local surveys and as seen in the huge influx of LGBT Filipinos in nationwide Pride Marches, notably the Metro Manila Pride March, one of the biggest in Asia.{{dubious|date=April 2016}}  &lt;ref&gt;https://psmag.com/social-justice/gay-population-lgbt-homosexual-sex-kinsey-68670&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and platforms==
Ladlad has the following platforms:&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;
#Re-filing of the Anti-Discrimination Bill that gives LGBT Filipinos equal opportunities in employment and equal treatment in schools, hospitals, restaurants, hotels, entertainment centers, and government offices.
#Re-filing of the bill to repeal the Anti-[[vagrancy (people)|Vagrancy]] Law that some unscrupulous policemen use to extort bribes from gay men without ID cards;
#Setting up of micro-finance and livelihood projects for poor and handicapped LGBT Filipinos;
#Setting up of centers for Golden Gays, or old and abandoned LGBTs, as well as young ones driven out of their homes. The centers will also offer legal aid and counseling, as well as information about LGBT issues, HIV-AIDS, and reproductive health. These centers will be set up initially in the key cities/metropolitan areas of the Philippines -- [[Baguio]], National Capital Region, [[Cebu]] and [[Davao City|Davao]].

[[Same-sex marriage]] is not yet part of the party's platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Church not anti-gay, says priest |author=Jorge Cariño |newspaper=ABS-CBN News |date=December 9, 2009 |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/12/08/09/church-not-anti-gay-says-priest |accessdate=December 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Left Turn''''' was a bimonthly activist [[news magazine]] that focused on international social justice movements. Based in [[New York City]] and produced by an all volunteer editorial collective, the magazine promoted [[anti-imperialism]] and [[anti-authoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Against the Grain |url=http://www.kpfa.org/archive/id/16595|work=Against the Grain|publisher=KPFA|accessdate=November 17, 2011|date=August 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Left Turn: Notes From The Global Intifada|url=http://www.akpress.org/2004/items/leftturn|work=AK Press|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Left Turn'' had its roots in the [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] wing of the [[Global Justice Movement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Building "Another Politics": The Contemporary Anti-Authoritarian Current in the U.S. and Canada|journal=Anarchist Studies|url=http://blogs.evergreen.edu/bohmerp/files/2011/10/Dixon-Another-Politics1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was founded in the wake of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|anti-WTO protests]] in Seattle in 1999 by a small group of socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Uhlenbeck|first=Max|title=From Below and to the Left&amp;nbsp;— A Brief History of Left Turn, 2001-2010|url=http://www.leftturn.org/history-left-turn-2001-2010|accessdate=November 17, 2011|work=Left Turn|date=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine's tagline, "Notes from the Global Intifada", was inspired by the then ongoing [[Second Intifada|Palestinian intifada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Uhlenbeck|first=Max|last2=El-Amine|first2=Rami|title=Left Turn &amp; The Movement: 2000-2010|url=http://www.organizingupgrade.com/2010/10/left-turn-and-the-movement/|accessdate=November 17, 2011|work=Organizing Upgrade|date=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine supported grassroots activists with the [[Palestine Solidarity Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Notes from the Global Intifada|url=http://www.leftturn.org/notes-global-intifada|accessdate=November 17, 2011|newspaper=Left Turn|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine ceased print publication after the August 2011 issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Current Issue | website=Left Turn | url=http://www.leftturn.org/current-issue | access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continues to operate a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Left Turn Editorial Collective |title=The Future of Left Turn | website=Left Turn | date=12 December 2011 | url=http://www.leftturn.org/future-left-turn | access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is under the [[patron]]age of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario]].]]

This is a '''list of Canadian organizations with designated royal status''', listed by the king or queen who granted the designation.

As a matter of honour, the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] may bestow on an organization the right to use the prefix ''royal'' before its name; this may be done for any type of constituted group, from [[Royal Ottawa Golf Club]] to [[the Royal Canadian Regiment]]. The granting of this distinction falls within the [[Royal Prerogative]], and thus is conferred by the monarch through the office of her [[viceroy]], with input from the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] on whether or not the institution meets the criteria of having been in existence for at least 25 years, being financially secure, and a non-profit organization, amongst others.&lt;ref name="DCHroyal"&gt;[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/criter_e.cfm Department of Canadian Heritage: Criteria for Royal patronage]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3039">The '''Little Rivonia Trial''' was a [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]]-era court case in which several members of the armed resistance group [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] faced charges of [[sabotage]]. The accused were: [[Laloo Chiba]], [[Dave Kitson (South Africa)|Dave Kitson]], [[Mac Maharaj]], [[John Matthews (South African)|John Matthews]] and [[Wilton Mkwayi]]. A confederate of theirs, [[Lionel Gay]] turned state witness, and in return, the prosecution dropped the charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =O'Malley  | first =Padraig  | title =Shades of difference. Mac Maharaj and the struggle for South Africa  | publisher =Viking  | date =2007  | location =New York  | pages =137–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Judge W.G. Boshoff presided over the November 1964 trial, with human rights lawyer [[George Bizos]] one of the advocates appearing for the defence. All the accused were found guilty. Maharaj's legal representatives were expecting that he would receive the [[death penalty]] for his Central Committee membership of the [[South African Communist Party]]. During the sentencing phase Mkwayi would simply say in his defence: "My Lord, I am a professional agitator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =O'Malley  | first =Padraig  | title =Shades of difference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5803">[[File:OldSuffolkCoCt.JPG|thumb|right|The Land Court is currently located within the Suffolk County Courthouse in Boston]]
The '''Massachusetts Land Court''' is one of the departments of the Trial Court of the [[Commonwealth (United States)|Commonwealth]] of [[Massachusetts]].  The court is unique among the courts of Massachusetts and among [[State court (United States)|state courts]] in general because its [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] is limited to disputes involving [[real property]].

==Jurisdiction==
The court's geographic [[jurisdiction]] covers all of Massachusetts.  The court usually sits in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], but may hold trials at other locations when necessary.&lt;ref name=jurisdiction&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/landcourt/jurisdiction.html Land Court Jurisdiction]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusive jurisdiction===
The Land Court has [[Exclusive jurisdiction|exclusive]] and [[original jurisdiction]] over the registration of title to real property (discussed ''infra''), over all matters and disputes concerning such title after registration, and over the [[foreclosure]] and redemption of real estate [[tax lien]]s.&lt;ref name=jurisdiction/&gt;

===Concurrent jurisdiction===
The Land Court shares jurisdiction over other property matters with other court departments.  The court's jurisdiction overlaps significantly with that of the [[Massachusetts Superior Court]] in many instances, because the Superior Court has original jurisdiction in civil actions over $25,000, and in matters where [[equitable relief]] is sought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/superiorcourt/index.html#Jurisdiction Jurisdiction of the Superior Court, from the Massachusetts Judiciary web site]&lt;/ref&gt;  The court has [[concurrent jurisdiction]] with the Superior Court over [[specific performance]] of [[real estate contracts]], over petitions for [[Partition (law)|partitions]] of real estate, and over the processing of mortgage foreclosure cases.&lt;ref name=jurisdiction/&gt;

The Land Court shares jurisdiction with the Superior Court and the Housing Court over matters arising out of decisions by local planning boards and zoning boards of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/40a-17.htm M.G.L. c. 40A, § 17].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permit Session===
Beginning in August 2006, the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts Legislature]] established a separate session of the Land Court, known as the "permit session". This session has original jurisdiction over certain civil actions involving land use and environmental permitting.  This jurisdiction is also concurrent with the Superior Court.&lt;ref name=jurisdiction/&gt;

==Responsibilities of the court==
Apart from adjudicating [[Legal case|cases]], [[Land registration|registration]] of [[Title (property)|title]] to real property is one of the Land Court's most important responsibilities.  Registration of title under Massachusetts state law occurs when the Land Court, after having the title exhaustively searched by a Court-appointed examiner, and after due process is afforded to all interested parties, reviews and then adjudicates and decrees the state of the title.  Once this process is complete, the current state of the title, as it is sequentially updated by registration of future transactions, is embodied in a certificate of title which both evidences and guarantees title, subject only to the exceptions provided by statute and matters of federal law. The initial decree of registration and the subsequent certificate of title are actions ''[[in rem]]''.  Registration is useful when title is insufficient to support a conclusion of ownership under the traditional [[Recording (real estate)|recording]] system, or is clearly defective, and the putative owner desires to make the title good and [[Marketable title|marketable]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/landcourt/lchist3.html History of the Land Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

The court employs a staff of engineers and surveyors to help accomplish the task of determining land title and boundaries.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  The Land Court also has superintendency authority over the registered land office in each registry of deeds.&lt;ref name=jurisdiction/&gt;

==History==
The Land Court was originally created by the Massachusetts Legislature in 1898 as the "Court of Registration".  The court's name was changed to the "Court of Land Registration" in 1900, before it was finally given its current name in 1904.  Over the first few years of its existence, the Court was brought into its current status as a [[court of record]] on a par with the Superior Court.  Until the creation of the [[Massachusetts Appeals Court]] in 1972, it was the only court of statewide jurisdiction other than the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Judicial Court]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The original text of Land Court cases is provided by Westlaw, Mass Cases and LexisNexis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1962">The '''Miner's Right''' was introduced in [[1855 in Australia|1855]] in the colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], replacing the [[Miner's Licence]]. Protests in [[1853 in Australia|1853]] at [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] with the formation of the [[Anti-Gold Licence Association]] and the rebellion of [[Eureka Stockade]] in December [[1854 in Australia|1854]] at [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] led to reform of the system with a cheaper annual fee of five shillings the right to mine gold, the right to vote, and the right to own land. Previously the mining licence was eight pounds a year.

In Ballarat as at [[1988 in Australia|1978]] some houses were still held with the tenure associated with a miner's right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bate | first = Weston | authorlink = Weston Bate | title = Lucky City: The First Generation at Ballarat: 1851 - 1901 | year = 1978 | publisher = Melbourne University Press | location = Carlton, Victoria, Australia | isbn = 0-522-84157-0 | page = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Australian colonies and New Zealand soon replaced the licensing system with Miner's Rights also.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2869">[[Image:Archbishop_Matthew_Parker.jpg|thumb|Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]]]]{{Portal|Anglicanism}}

The '''Nag's Head Fable''' was a fiction which purported that [[Matthew Parker]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] under [[Elizabeth I]], was consecrated with a Bible pressed to his neck in the Nag's Head tavern in [[Cheapside]]. The story surfaced more than 40 years after Parker's consecration and was spread by some [[Roman Catholic]]s as fact until the dawn of the 20th century.
__NOTOC__
==Fact and fiction==
On the passing of the [[Act of Uniformity 1559]], shortly after the start of [[Elizabeth I]]'s reign, fourteen [[bishops]] were dismissed from their [[diocese|sees]], and all the other sees, except [[Diocese of Llandaff|Llandaff]] (then part of the [[Church of England]]), were at the time vacant.{{sfn|Brewer|1894}} [[Matthew Parker]] had been selected as Archbishop of Canterbury, but there was a question of how to obtain [[consecration]] so as to preserve unbroken [[apostolic succession]], as the [[Bishop of Llandaff]], [[Anthony Kitchin]], opposed Parker's appointment and refused to officiate.{{sfn|Brewer|1894}} The allegation of an indecent consecration in the Nag's Head Fable seems first to have been made by a [[Jesuit]], [[Christopher Holywood]], in 1604, over 40 years after the event.

According to [[propaganda]], [[John Scory]], the deposed [[Bishop of Chichester]], was sent for  and officiated at the Nag's Head tavern in [[Cheapside]].{{sfn|Brewer|1894}} There Parker was supposedly consecrated by having a Bible pressed to his neck while Scory said, "Take thou authority to preach the word of God sincerely."{{sfn|Brewer|1894}}

This story was later discredited, as a full eyewitness description was found of the consecration of Parker, in [[Lambeth Palace Chapel]], by bishops Scory, [[William Barlow (bishop of Chichester)|William Barlow]], [[Myles Coverdale]], and [[John Hodgkins]].  In this account it is stated that it was not the consecration which took place at the Nag's Head, but only that those who took part in it dined there subsequently.{{sfn|Moss|1965|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;64}}

As recently as the late nineteenth century, the legend was still being told as fact by controversialists in such countries as [[Sri Lanka]].{{sfn|Moss|1965|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;64}}

'''Nuclear disarmament''' is the act of reducing or eliminating [[nuclear weapon]]s. It can also be the end state of a nuclear-weapons-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.  The term '''denuclearization''' is also used to describe the process leading to complete nuclear disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gastelum|first1=ZN|title=International Legal Framework for Denuclearization and Nuclear Disarmament|url=http://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-22092.pdf|website=[[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]]|page=7|date=2012|quote=The term ''denuclearization'' is even less agreed upon [than ''disarmament''] in the international community, and appears rarely in the context of arms control and nuclear nonproliferation.

[[List of anti-nuclear groups|Nuclear disarmament groups]] include the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Peace Action]], [[Greenpeace]],  [[Soka Gakkai International]], [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]], [[Mayors for Peace]], [[Global Zero (campaign)|Global Zero]], the [[International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons]], and the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]]. There have been many large [[anti-nuclear]] [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's [[Central Park]] against [[nuclear weapon]]s and for an end to the [[cold war]] [[arms race]]. It was the largest anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|protest]] and the largest political demonstration in American history.&lt;ref name="The Spirit of June 12"&gt;Jonathan Schell.

In recent years, some U.S. elder statesmen have also advocated nuclear disarmament. [[Sam Nunn]], [[William Perry]], [[Henry Kissinger]], and [[George Shultz]] have called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in various op-ed columns have proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the [[Nuclear Security Project]] to advance this agenda. Organisations such as [[Global Zero (campaign)|Global Zero]], an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to achieving nuclear disarmament, have also been established.

Proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] occurring, especially accidentally. Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]].

It was the first U.S. nuclear field exercise conducted on land; troops shown are {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the blast.]]

In 1945 in the [[New Mexico]] desert, American scientists conducted "[[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]," the first [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons test]], marking the beginning of the [[atomic age]].&lt;ref name=pal/&gt; Even before the Trinity test, national leaders debated the impact of nuclear weapons on domestic and foreign policy. Also involved in the debate about nuclear weapons policy was the scientific community, through professional associations such as the [[Federation of Atomic Scientists]] and the [[Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs]].&lt;ref name=brow/&gt;

On August 6, 1945, towards the end of [[World War II]], the "[[Little Boy]]" device was detonated over the [[Japan]]ese city of [[Hiroshima]]. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500&amp;nbsp;tonnes of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings (including the [[headquarters]] of the [[Second General Army (Japan)|2nd General Army]] and [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Fifth Division]]) and killed 70,000–80,000 people outright, with total deaths being around 90,000–146,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2001 |chapter=Uranium |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A to Z Guide to the Elements |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn=0-19-850340-7 |authorlink=John Emsley |first=John |last=Emsley |pages=478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detonation of the "[[Fat Man]]" device exploded over the Japanese city of [[Nagasaki]] three days later on 9 August 1945, destroying 60% of the city and killing 35,000–40,000 people outright, though up to 40,000 additional deaths may have occurred over some time after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nuke-Rebuke: Writers &amp; Artists Against Nuclear Energy &amp; Weapons (The Contemporary anthology series) |pages=22–29 |date=May 1, 1984 |publisher=The Spirit That Moves Us Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rerf.or.jp/general/qa_e/qa1.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions #1 |publisher=[[Radiation Effects Research Foundation]] (Formerly known as the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC)) | accessdate=September 18, 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919143939/http://www.rerf.or.jp/general/qa_e/qa1.html| archivedate=September 19, 2007 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the world’s nuclear weapons stockpiles grew.&lt;ref name=pal&gt;Mary Palevsky, Robert Futrell, and Andrew Kirk.

[[Operation Crossroads]] was a series of [[nuclear weapon]] tests conducted by the [[United States and nuclear weapons|United States]] at [[Bikini Atoll]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the summer of 1946. Its purpose was to test the effect of nuclear weapons on naval ships. Pressure to cancel Operation Crossroads came from scientists and diplomats. [[Manhattan Project]] scientists argued that further nuclear testing was unnecessary and environmentally dangerous. A Los Alamos study warned "the water near a recent surface explosion will be a 'witch's brew' of radioactivity". To prepare the atoll for the nuclear tests, Bikini's native residents were evicted from their homes and resettled on smaller, uninhabited islands where they were unable to sustain themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Radioactive fallout]] from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when a [[hydrogen bomb]] test in the Pacific contaminated the crew of the Japanese fishing boat ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name=rudig2/&gt; One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later. The incident caused widespread concern around the world and "provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries".&lt;ref name=rudig2&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-nuclear weapons movement grew rapidly because for many people the atomic bomb "encapsulated the very worst direction in which society was moving".&lt;ref name=falkj&gt;Jim Falk (1982).

Peace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified "Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs". Japanese opposition to the Pacific nuclear weapons tests was widespread, and "an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons".&lt;ref name="falkj"/&gt; In the United Kingdom, the first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] organised by the [[Direct Action Committee]] and supported by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] took place on [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=CND&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html A brief history of CND]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianUnlimited:1958&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | title = Early defections in march to Aldermaston | date = 1958-04-05 | url = http://century.guardian.co.uk/1950-1959/Story/0,,105488,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; CND organised Aldermaston marches into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day events.&lt;ref name=falkj/&gt;

On November 1, 1961, at the height of the [[Cold War]], about 50,000 women brought together by [[Women Strike for Peace]] marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against [[nuclear weapons]].

In 1958, Linus Pauling and his wife presented the United Nations with the petition signed by more than 11,000 scientists calling for an end to [[nuclear testing|nuclear-weapon testing]]. The "[[Baby Tooth Survey]]," headed by Dr [[Louise Reiss]], demonstrated conclusively in 1961 that above-ground nuclear testing posed significant public health risks in the form of [[nuclear fallout|radioactive fallout]] spread primarily via milk from cows that had ingested contaminated grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/134/3491/1669.pdf | title=Strontium-90 Absorption by Deciduous Teeth: Analysis of teeth provides a practicable method of monitoring strontium-90 uptake by human populations | accessdate=October 13, 2009 | author=Louise Zibold Reiss | date=November 24, 1961 | publisher=Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/peace/narrative/page26.html | title=Strontium-90 | accessdate=December 13, 2007 | author=Thomas Hager | date=November 29, 2007 | publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/peace/narrative/page27.html | title=The Right to Petition | accessdate=December 13, 2007 | author=Thomas Hager | date=November 29, 2007 | publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public pressure and the research results subsequently led to a moratorium on above-ground nuclear weapons testing, followed by the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], signed in 1963 by [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day that the treaty went into force, the Nobel Prize Committee awarded Pauling the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], describing him as "Linus Carl Pauling, who ever since 1946 has campaigned ceaselessly, not only against nuclear weapons tests, not only against the spread of these armaments, not only against their very use, but against all warfare as a means of solving international conflicts."&lt;ref name=brow&gt;Jerry Brown and [[Rinaldo Brutoco]] (1997).

In the 1980s, a movement for nuclear disarmament again gained strength in the light of the weapons build-up and statements of [[US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan had "a world free of nuclear weapons" as his personal mission,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/07/giulianis-obama-nuke-crit_n_528439.html Giuliani's Obama-Nuke Critique Defies And Ignores Reagan], Huffington Post 04- 7-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/Lecture/President-Reagans-Legacy-and-US-Nuclear-Weapons-Policy President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy], Heritage.org, July 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS9510/&gt; and was largely scorned for this in Europe.&lt;ref name=HS9510/&gt; Reagan was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=HS9510&gt;"Hyvästi, ydinpommi", [[Helsingin Sanomat]] 2010-09-05, p.

===World Peace Council===

One of the earliest peace organisations to emerge after the Second World War was the [[World Peace Council]],&lt;ref&gt;Wittner, Lawrence S., ''One World or None: A History of the World Nuclear Disarmament Movement Through 1953'', Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1993. Paperback edition, 1995. {{ISBN|0804721416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Santi, Rainer, ''100 years of Peace Making: A History of the International Peace Bureau and other international peace movement organisations and networks'', Pax förlag, International Peace Bureau, January 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Wernicke, Günther, "The World Peace Council and the Antiwar Movement in East Germany", in Daum, A.

Mausbach (eds), ''America, The Vietnam War and the World'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which was directed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] through the [[Soviet Peace Committee]].  Its origins lay in the [[Communist Information Bureau]]'s (Cominform) doctrine, put forward 1947, that the world was divided between peace-loving progressive forces led by the Soviet Union and warmongering capitalist countries led by the United States. In 1949, Cominform directed that peace "should now become the pivot of the entire activity of the Communist Parties", and most western Communist parties followed this policy.&lt;ref name=deery&gt;[https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000637202 Deery, P., "The Dove Flies East: Whitehall, Warsaw and the 1950 World Peace Congress", ''Australian Journal of Politics and History'', Vol. 48, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence S. Wittner|Lawrence Wittner]], a historian of the post-war peace movement, argues that the Soviet Union devoted great efforts to the promotion of the WPC in the early post-war years because it feared an American attack and American superiority of arms&lt;ref name=wittner/&gt; at a time when the USA possessed the [[atom bomb]] but the Soviet Union had not yet developed it.&lt;ref name=santi&gt;[http://santibox.ch/Peace/Peacemaking.html#5.%20A%20New%20Start Santi, Rainer, ''100 years of peace making: A history of the International Peace Bureau and other international peace movement organisations and networks'', Pax förlag, International Peace Bureau, January 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the WPC launched its [[Stockholm Appeal]]&lt;ref name=peaceoffensive&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/reportoncommunis00unit/reportoncommunis00unit_djvu.txt [[Committee on Un-American Activities]], ''Report on the Communist "peace" offensive.  A campaign to disarm and defeat the United States'', 1951]&lt;/ref&gt; calling for the absolute prohibition of nuclear weapons. The campaign won support, collecting, it is said, 560 million signatures in Europe, most from socialist countries, including 10 million in France (including that of the young [[Jacques Chirac]]), and 155 million signatures in the Soviet Union – the entire adult population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intl.hiroshima-cu.ac.jp/~yulia/publ/peace.htm Mikhailova, Y., ''Ideas of Peace and Concordance in Soviet Political Propaganda (1950 – 1985'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Several non-aligned peace groups who had distanced themselves from the WPC advised their supporters not to sign the Appeal.&lt;ref name=santi/&gt;

The WPC had uneasy relations with the non-aligned peace movement and has been described as being caught in contradictions as "it sought to become a broad world movement while being instrumentalized increasingly to serve foreign policy in the Soviet Union and nominally socialist countries."&lt;ref&gt;Wernicke, Günter, [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/pech/1998/00000023/00000003/art00002 "The Communist-Led World Peace Council and the Western Peace Movements: The Fetters of Bipolarity and Some Attempts to Break Them in the Fifties and Early Sixties"], Peace &amp; Change, Volume 23, Number 3, July 1998, pp. 265–311(47)&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1950s until the late 1980s it tried to use non-aligned peace organizations to spread the Soviet point of view.  At first there was limited co-operation between such groups and the WPC, but western delegates who tried to criticize the Soviet Union or the WPC's silence about Russian armaments were often shouted down at WPC conferences&lt;ref name=wittner&gt;Lawrence Wittner, ''Resisting the Bomb'', Stanford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and by the early 1960s they had dissociated themselves from the WPC.

==Arms reduction treaties==
[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|[[United States]] and [[USSR]]/[[Russia]]n [[nuclear weapons]] stockpiles, 1945-2014. These numbers include warheads not actively deployed, including those on reserve status or scheduled for dismantlement. Stockpile totals do not necessarily reflect nuclear capabilities since they ignore size, range, type, and delivery mode.]]
After the 1986 [[Reykjavik Summit]] between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and the new Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, the United States and the Soviet Union concluded two  important nuclear arms reduction treaties: the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]] (1987) and [[START I]] (1991).  After the end of the Cold War, the United States and the Russian Federation concluded the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] (2003) and the [[New START]] Treaty (2010).

When the extreme danger intrinsic to nuclear war and the possession of nuclear weapons became apparent to all sides during the Cold War, a series of disarmament and nonproliferation treaties were agreed upon between the United States, the Soviet Union, and several other states throughout the world. Many of these treaties involved years of negotiations, and seemed to result in important steps in arms reductions and reducing the risk of nuclear war.

'''Key treaties'''
* [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] (PTBT) 1963: Prohibited all testing of nuclear weapons except underground.
* [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT)—signed 1968, came into force 1970: An international treaty (currently with 189 member states) to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. The treaty has three main pillars: nonproliferation, disarmament, and the right to peacefully use nuclear technology.
* [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT I|Interim Agreement on Offensive Arms]] (SALT I) 1972: The Soviet Union and the United States agreed to a freeze in the number of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) and [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) that they would deploy.
* [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] (ABM) 1972: The United States and Soviet Union could deploy ABM interceptors at two sites, each with up to 100 ground-based launchers for ABM interceptor missiles. In a 1974 Protocol, the US and Soviet Union agreed to only deploy an ABM system to one site.
* [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT II|Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty]] (SALT II) 1979: Replacing SALT I, SALT II limited both the Soviet Union and the United States to an equal number of ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers. Also placed limits on Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles (MIRVS).
* [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] (INF) 1987: Created a global ban on short- and long-range nuclear weapons systems, as well as an intrusive verification regime.
* [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] (START I)—signed 1991, ratified 1994: Limited long-range nuclear forces in the United States and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to 6,000 attributed warheads on 1,600 ballistic missiles and bombers.
* [[START II|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II]] (START II)—signed 1993, never put into force: START II was a bilateral agreement between the US and Russia which attempted to commit each side to deploy no more than 3,000 to 3,500 warheads by December 2007 and also included a prohibition against deploying multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs) on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)
* [[SORT|Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] (SORT or Moscow Treaty)—signed 2002, into force 2003: A very loose treaty that is often criticized by arms control advocates for its ambiguity and lack of depth, Russia and the United States agreed to reduce their "strategic nuclear warheads" (a term that remained undefined in the treaty) to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012. Was superseded by New Start Treaty in 2010.
* [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] (CTBT)—signed 1996, not yet in force: The CTBT is an international treaty (currently with 181 state signatures and 148 state ratifications) that bans all nuclear explosions in all environments. While the treaty is not in force, Russia has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1990 and the United States has not since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspw.org/index.php?title=Portal:Nuclear_Disarmament "Nuclear Disarmament," US Policy World.  http://www.uspw.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[START treaty (2010)|New START Treaty]]—signed 2010, into force in 2011: replaces SORT treaty, reduces deployed nuclear warheads by about half, will remain into force until at least 2021
* [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]]—signed 2017, not yet in force: prohibits possession, manufacture, development, and testing of nuclear weapons, or assistance in such activities, by its parties.
Only one country has been known to ever dismantle their nuclear arsenal completely—the [[apartheid]] government of [[South Africa]] apparently developed half a dozen crude [[fission weapon]]s during the 1980s, but they were dismantled in the early 1990s.

==United Nations==
[[File:Angela Kane at Nagasaki Peace Memorial Ceremony.jpg|thumb|UN [[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs|Representative for Disarmament Affairs]], [[Angela Kane]], at a 2012 ceremony marking the anniversary of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings]]]]
{{Main|United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs}}
In its landmark resolution 1653 of 1961, "Declaration on the prohibition of the use of nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons," the UN General Assembly stated that use of nuclear weaponry “would exceed even the scope of war and cause indiscriminate suffering and destruction to mankind and civilization and, as such, is contrary to the rules of international law and to the laws of humanity”.&lt;ref name=burr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abolitionforum.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IHL-or-nuclear-weapons_choose-one.pdf |title=Humanitarian Law or Nuclear Weapons: Choose One |author=John Burroughs  |year=2012 |work=Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) is a department of the [[United Nations Secretariat]] established in January 1998 as part of the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]]'s plan to reform the UN as presented in his report to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] in July 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N97/189/79/IMG/N9718979.pdf?OpenElement Renewing the United Nations: A Program for Reform (A/51/950)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its goal is to promote nuclear disarmament and [[non-proliferation]] and the strengthening of the disarmament regimes in respect to other [[weapons of mass destruction]], [[Chemical weapons|chemical]] and [[biological weapons]]. It also promotes disarmament efforts in the area of [[conventional weapon]]s, especially [[land mine]]s and [[small arms]], which are often the weapons of choice in contemporary conflicts.

Following the retirement of [[Sergio Duarte]] in February 2012, [[Angela Kane]] was appointed as the new [[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs|High Representative for Disarmament Affairs]].

On 7 July 2017, a UN conference adopted the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]] with the backing of 122 states. It opened for signature on 20 September 2017.

==U.S. nuclear policy==
Despite a general trend toward disarmament in the early 2000s, the [[George W. Bush administration]] repeatedly pushed to fund policies that would allegedly make nuclear weapons more usable in the post–Cold War environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/30/usa.georgebush]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2099425/]&lt;/ref&gt; To date the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] has refused to fund many of these policies. However, some &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0709-06.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; feel that even considering such programs harms the credibility of the United States as a proponent of nonproliferation.

===Controversial U.S. nuclear policies===
* [[Reliable Replacement Warhead Program]] (RRW): This program seeks to replace existing warheads with a smaller number of warhead types designed to be easier to maintain without testing.  Critics charge that this would lead to a new generation of nuclear weapons and would increase pressures to test.  Congress has not funded this program.
* '''Complex Transformation''': Complex transformation, formerly known as Complex 2030, is an effort to shrink the U.S. nuclear weapons complex and restore the ability to produce “pits” the fissile cores of the primaries of U.S. thermonuclear weapons.  Critics see it as an upgrade to the entire nuclear weapons complex to support the production and maintenance of the new generation of nuclear weapons.  Congress has not funded this program.
* [[Nuclear bunker buster]]: Formally known as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), this program aimed to modify an existing gravity bomb to penetrate into [[soil]] and [[Rock (geology)|rock]] in order to destroy underground targets.  Critics argue that this would lower the threshold for use of nuclear weapons.  Congress did not fund this proposal, which was later withdrawn.
* [[National Missile Defense|Missile Defense]]: Formerly known as National Missile Defense, this program seeks to build a network of interceptor missiles to protect the United States and its allies from incoming missiles, including nuclear-armed missiles.  Critics have argued that this would impede nuclear disarmament and possibly stimulate a [[nuclear arms race]].  Elements of missile defense are being deployed in Poland and the Czech Republic, despite Russian opposition.

Former U.S. officials Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Bill Perry, and Sam Nunn (aka 'The Gang of Four' on Nuclear Deterrence)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://disarmingconflict.ca/2011/03/12/the-gang-of-four-on-nuclear-deterrence/, The Gang of Four on Nuclear Deterrence]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed in January 2007 that the United States rededicate itself to the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, concluding: "We endorse setting the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons and working energetically on the actions required to achieve that goal."  Arguing a year later that "with nuclear weapons more widely available, deterrence is decreasingly effective and increasingly hazardous," the authors concluded that although "it is tempting and easy to say we can't get there from here, [...] we must chart a course” toward that goal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2020visioncampaign.org/pages/336 Renewed call from Kissinger, Nunn, Perry and Shultz for Nuclear-Free World]&lt;/ref&gt;  During his presidential campaign, U.S. [[President-Elect]] Barack Obama pledged to "set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons, and pursue it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://origin.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/#nuclear Barack Obama and Joe Biden's Plan to Secure America and Restore our Standing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001020847/http://origin.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/ |date=2008-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. policy options for nuclear terrorism===
The United States has taken the lead in ensuring that nuclear materials globally are properly safeguarded. A popular program that has received bipartisan domestic support for over a decade is the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR). While this program has been deemed a success, many believe that its funding levels need to be increased so as to ensure that all dangerous nuclear materials are secured in the most expeditious manner possible. The CTR program has led to several other innovative and important nonproliferation programs that need to continue to be a budget priority in order to ensure that nuclear weapons do not spread to actors hostile to the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Key programs:
* '''Cooperative Threat Reduction''' (CTR): The CTR program provides funding to help Russia secure materials that might be used in nuclear or [[chemical weapons]] as well as to dismantle [[weapons of mass destruction]] and their associated infrastructure in Russia.
* '''Global Threat Reduction Initiative''' (GTRI): Expanding on the success of the CTR, the GTRI will expand nuclear weapons and material securing and dismantlement activities to states outside of the former Soviet Union.

While the vast majority of states have adhered to the stipulations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a few states have either refused to sign the treaty or have pursued nuclear weapons programs while not being members of the treaty. Many view the pursuit of nuclear weapons by these states as a threat to nonproliferation and [[world peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/nonproliferation-arms-control-and-disarmament/global-nuclear-nonproliferation-regime/p18984|title=The Global Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime|last=|first=|date=|website=Council On Foreign Relations|access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
Eliminating nuclear weapons has long been an aim of the pacifist left. But now many mainstream politicians, academic analysts, and retired military leaders also advocate nuclear disarmament. [[Sam Nunn]], [[William Perry]], [[Henry Kissinger]], and [[George Shultz]] have called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in three ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' opeds proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda.  Nunn reinforced that agenda during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School on October 21, 2008, saying, "I’m much more concerned about a terrorist without a return address that cannot be deterred than I am about deliberate war between nuclear powers. You can’t deter a group who is willing to commit suicide. We are in a different era. You have to understand the world has changed."&lt;ref&gt;Maclin, Beth (2008-10-20) [http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18606/ "A Nuclear weapon-free world is possible, Nunn says"], Belfer Center, Harvard University. Retrieved on 2008-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled ''[[Nuclear Tipping Point]]''.  The film is a visual and historical depiction of the ideas laid forth in the Wall Street Journal op-eds and reinforces their commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and the steps that can be taken to reach that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=The Growing Appeal of Zero |author= |date=June 18, 2011 |work=The Economist |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global Zero (campaign)|Global Zero]] is an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to achieving nuclear disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalzero.org?name=2.htm&amp;id=2&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative, launched in December 2008, promotes a phased withdrawal and verification for the destruction of all devices held by official and unofficial members of the [[nuclear club]]. The Global Zero campaign works toward building an international consensus and a sustained global movement of leaders and citizens for the elimination of [[nuclear weapon]]s. Goals include the initiation of [[United States]]-[[Russia]] bilateral negotiations for reductions to 1,000 total warheads each and commitments from the other key nuclear weapons countries to participate in multilateral negotiations for phased reductions of nuclear arsenals. Global Zero works to expand the diplomatic dialogue with key governments and continue to develop policy proposals on the critical issues related to the elimination of nuclear weapons.

The [[International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament, Oslo, 2008|International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament]] took place in [[Oslo]] in February, 2008, and was organized by The Government of [[Norway]], the [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] and the [[Hoover Institute]]. The Conference was entitled ''Achieving the Vision of a World Free of Nuclear Weapons'' and had the purpose of building consensus between nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states in relation to the [[Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://disarmament.nrpa.no/ |title=International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament |date=February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104155217/http://disarmament.nrpa.no/ |archivedate=2011-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tehran International Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, 2010|Tehran International Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation]] took place in [[Tehran]] in April 2010. The conference was held shortly after the signing of the [[New START]], and resulted in a call of action toward eliminating all nuclear weapons. Representatives from 60 countries were invited to the conference. [[Non-governmental organization]]s were also present.

Among the prominent figures who have called for the abolition of nuclear weapons are "the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], the entertainer [[Steve Allen]], [[CNN]]’s [[Ted Turner]], former [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Claiborne Pell]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] president [[Theodore Hesburgh]], South African Bishop [[Desmond Tutu]] and the [[Dalai Lama]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=40 |title=Nuclear Weapons: Instruments of Peace  |author=Ernest Lefever |date=Autumn 1999 |volume=1 |issue=2 |work=Global Dialogue }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that nuclear weapons have made the world relatively safer, with peace through [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] and through the [[stability–instability paradox]], including in south Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/ESCCONTROLCHAPTER1.pdf|title=The Stability-Instability Paradox, Misperception, and Escalation Control in South Asia|last=Krepon|first=Michael|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230611/http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/ESCCONTROLCHAPTER1.pdf|archive-date=2 May 2013|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krepon.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/2911/the-stability-instability-paradox|title=The Stability-Instability Paradox|last=Krepon|first=Michael|date=November 2, 2010|website=Arms Control Wonk|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112223352/http://krepon.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/2911/the-stability-instability-paradox|archivedate=January 12, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Waltz]] has argued that nuclear weapons have created a [[nuclear peace]], and further nuclear weapon proliferation might even help avoid the large scale conventional wars that were so common prior to their invention at the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm Kenneth Waltz, “The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: More May be Better,”&lt;/ref&gt; In the July 2012 issue of [[Foreign Affairs]] Waltz took issue with the view of most U.S., European, and Israeli, commentators and policymakers that a nuclear-armed Iran would be unacceptable.

Former Secretary Kissinger says there is a new danger, which cannot be addressed by deterrence: "The classical notion of deterrence was that there was some consequences before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil.

[[Andrew Bacevich]] wrote that there is no feasible scenario under which the US could sensibly use nuclear weapons.  "For the United States, they are becoming unnecessary, even as a deterrent.  Certainly, they are unlikely to dissuade the adversaries most likely to employ such weapons against us -- Islamic extremists intent on acquiring their own nuclear capability.  If anything, the opposite is true.  By retaining a strategic arsenal in readiness (and by insisting without qualification that the dropping of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities in 1945 was justified), the United States continues tacitly to sustain the view that nuclear weapons play a legitimate role in international politics ... ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bacevich|first1=Andrew|title=The Limits of Power|date=2008|publisher=Metropolitan Books|isbn=9780805088151|pages=178-179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Limits of Safety'', [[Scott Sagan]] documented numerous incidents in US military history that could have produced a nuclear war by accident. He concluded, "while the military organizations controlling U.S. nuclear forces during the Cold War performed this task with less success than we know, they performed with more success than we ''should'' have reasonably predicted.  The problems identified in this book were not the product of incompetent organizations.  They reflect [[System accident|the inherent limits of organizational safety]].  Recognizing that simple truth is the first and most important step toward a safer future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagan|first1=Scott D.|title=The Limits of Safety: Organizations, Accidents, and Nuclear Weapons|date=1993|publisher=Princeton U.

[[File:PSoule.jpg|thumb|Pierre Soulé, the driving force behind the Ostend Manifesto]]
{{Events leading to US Civil War}}
The '''Ostend Manifesto''', also known as the '''Ostend Circular''', was a document written in 1854 that described the rationale for the United States to purchase [[Cuba]] from Spain while implying that the U.S. should declare war if Spain refused. Cuba's annexation had long been a goal of U.S. slaveholding expansionists, and was supported by [[Ambrosio José Gonzales#Cuban revolutionary|a faction in Cuba itself]]. At the national level, American leaders had been satisfied to have the island remain in weak Spanish hands so long as it did not pass to a stronger power such as Britain or France. The Ostend Manifesto proposed a shift in foreign policy, justifying the use of force to seize Cuba in the name of national security. It resulted from debates over [[slavery in the United States]], [[Manifest Destiny]], and the [[Monroe Doctrine]], as slaveholders sought new territory for slavery's expansion.

During the administration of President [[Franklin Pierce]], a pro-Southern Democrat, Southern expansionists called for acquiring Cuba as a [[slave state]], but the outbreak of violence following the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] left the administration unsure of how to proceed. At the suggestion of Secretary of State [[William L. Marcy]], American ministers in Europe—[[Pierre Soulé]] for Spain, [[James Buchanan]] for Great Britain, and [[John Y. Mason]] for France—met to discuss strategy related to an acquisition of Cuba. They met secretly at [[Ostend]], Belgium, and drafted a dispatch at [[Aix-la-Chapelle]]. The document was sent to Washington in October 1854, outlining why a purchase of Cuba would be beneficial to each of the nations and declaring that the U.S. would be "justified in wresting" the island from Spanish hands if Spain refused to sell. To Marcy's chagrin, Soulé made no secret of the meetings, causing unwanted publicity in both Europe and the U.S. The administration was finally forced to publish the contents of the dispatch, which caused it irreparable damage.

The dispatch was published as demanded by the House of Representatives. Dubbed the "Ostend Manifesto", it was immediately denounced in both the Northern states and Europe. The Pierce administration suffered a significant setback, and the manifesto became a rallying cry for anti-slavery Northerners. The question of Cuba's annexation was effectively set aside until the late 19th century, when support grew for Cuban independence from Spain.

==Historical context==
Located {{convert|90|mi|km}} off the coast of [[Florida]], Cuba had been discussed as a subject for [[annexation]] in several presidential administrations. Presidents [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] expressed great interest in Cuba, with Adams observing during his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] tenure that it had "become an object of transcendent importance to the commercial and political interests of our Union".&lt;ref&gt;Hershey (1896), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; He later described Cuba and [[Puerto Rico]] as "natural appendages to the North American continent"&lt;ref&gt;Schoultz (1998), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;—the former's annexation was "indispensable to the continuance and integrity of the Union itself."&lt;ref&gt;Schoultz (1998), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Spanish Empire]] had lost much of its power, a no-transfer policy began with Jefferson whereby the U.S. respected Spanish sovereignty, considering the island's eventual absorption inevitable. The U.S. simply wanted to ensure that control did not pass to a stronger power such as Britain or France.&lt;ref&gt;May (1973), pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba was of special importance to Southern Democrats, who believed their economic and political interests would be best served by the admission of another slave state to the Union. The existence of [[slavery in Cuba]], the island's [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]] economy based on sugar, and its geographical location predisposed it to Southern influence;&lt;ref&gt;May (1972), pp. 46–60.&lt;/ref&gt; its admission would greatly strengthen the position of Southern slaveholders, whose way of life was under fire from Northern [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (1939), p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas immigration to Northern industrial centers had resulted in Northern control of the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], Southern politicians sought to maintain the fragile [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], where each state received equal representation. As slavery-free Western states were admitted, Southern politicians increasingly looked to Cuba as the next [[slave state]].&lt;ref&gt;May (1973), pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schoultz 49-51"&gt;Schoultz (1998), pp. 49–51, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; If Cuba were admitted to the Union as a single state, the island would have sent two senators and up to nine representatives to Washington.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Cuba's population in 1850 was 651,223 white and free persons of color and 322,519 enslaved people ({{cite book|author=Kenneth F. Kiple|title=Blacks in Colonial Cuba: 1774–1899|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSryMQEACAAJ|year=1976|publisher=University Presses of Florida|location=Gainesville, FL|isbn=978-0-8130-0520-1|pages=4–5}}). With slaves counting as [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths of a person]], the population would have been considered 844,734 for determining Congressional apportionment. After the [[1850 United States Census|1850 census]], the [[United States congressional apportionment#House size|ratio of congressman-to-constituent]] was 1:93,425, which would have yielded nine representatives for Cuba. Georgia had a similar population breakdown (524,503 free; 381,682 enslaved; total for apportionment 753,512) in the 1850 census and sent eight representatives to the [[33rd United States Congress]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], the debate over the continued expansion of the United States centered on how quickly, rather than whether, to expand.&lt;ref&gt;Schoultz (1998), pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical expansionists and the [[Young America movement]] were quickly gaining traction by 1848, and a debate about whether to annex the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] portion of [[Mexico]] that year included significant discussion of Cuba. Even [[John C. Calhoun]], described as a reluctant expansionist who strongly disagreed with intervention on the basis of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], concurred that "it is indispensable to the safety of the United States that this island should not be in certain hands".&lt;ref name="Schoultz 49-51" /&gt; likely referring to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;May (1973), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of a Cuban uprising, President [[James K. Polk]] refused solicitations from [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] backer [[John L. O'Sullivan]] and stated his belief that any acquisition of the island must be an "amicable purchase."&lt;ref name="Brown 21–28"&gt;Brown (1980), pp. 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Under orders from Polk, Secretary of State [[James Buchanan]] prepared an offer of $100 million, but "sooner than see [Cuba] transferred to any power, [Spanish officials] would prefer seeing it sunk into the ocean."&lt;ref&gt;Bemis (1965), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] administrations of presidents [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Millard Fillmore]] did not pursue the matter and took a harsher stand against filibusters such as [[Venezuela]]n [[Narciso Lopez]], with federal troops intercepting several expeditions bound for Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Bemis (1965), pp. 303, 313–314.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Franklin Pierce]] took office in 1853, however, he was committed to Cuba's annexation.&lt;ref name="Schoultz 49-51" /&gt;

==The Pierce administration==
At Pierce's [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]], he stated, "The policy of my Administration will not be controlled by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion."&lt;ref name="Bemis 309-320"&gt;Bemis (1965), pp. 309–320.&lt;/ref&gt; While slavery was not the stated goal nor Cuba mentioned by name, the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] makeup of his party required the Northerner to appeal to Southern interests, so he favored the annexation of Cuba as a slave state. To this end, he appointed expansionists to diplomatic posts throughout Europe, notably sending [[Pierre Soulé]], an outspoken proponent of Cuban annexation, as United States Minister to Spain.&lt;ref name="Bemis 309-320" /&gt; The Northerners in his cabinet were fellow [[doughface]]s (Northerners with Southern sympathies) such as Buchanan, who was made Minister to Great Britain after a failed bid for the presidency at the [[Democratic National Convention]], and Secretary of State [[William L. Marcy]], whose appointment was also an attempt to placate the "Old Fogies." This was the term for the wing of the party that favored slow, cautious expansion.&lt;ref name="Potter 184–188"&gt;Potter (1967), pp. 184–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1854, the steamer ''Black Warrior'' stopped at the Cuban port of [[Havana]] on a regular trading route from New York City to [[Mobile, Alabama]]. When it failed to provide a cargo manifest, Cuban officials seized the ship, its cargo, and its crew. The so-called [[Black Warrior Affair|''Black Warrior'' Affair]] was viewed by Congress as a violation of American rights; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soulé to the Spanish to return the ship served only to strain relations, and he was barred from discussing Cuba's acquisition for nearly a year.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1980), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; While the matter was resolved peacefully, it fueled the flames of Southern expansionism.&lt;ref&gt;Schoultz (1998), pp. 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the doctrine of [[Manifest Destiny]] had become increasingly [[Sectionalism|sectionalized]] as the decade progressed. While there were still Northerners who believed the United States should dominate the continent, most were opposed to Cuba's annexation, particularly as a slave state.&lt;ref&gt;Bemis (1965), pp. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern-backed filibusters, including [[Narciso López]], had failed repeatedly since 1849 to 1851 to overthrow the colonial government despite considerable support among the Cuban people for independence,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The actions of the filibusters violated U.S. neutrality laws, but Pierce's administration did not prosecute them as heavily as the Whig administrations that preceded him. Both expansionists and advocates of Cuban independence wanted the island to leave Spanish rule. López believed the sectional competition in the U.S. would prevent it from annexing Cuba and clear the way for Cuban independence. See Bemis (1965), pp. 313–317. For more information, see Brown (1980), Part I: "The Pearl of the Antilles".&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of reforms on the island made Southerners apprehensive that slavery would be abolished. They believed that Cuba would be "Africanized," as the majority of the population were slaves, and they had seen the [[Haitian Revolution|Republic of Haiti]] established by former slaves. The notion of a pro-slavery invasion by the U.S. was rejected in light of the controversy over the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]. During internal discussions, supporters of gaining Cuba decided that a purchase or intervention in the name of [[national security]] was the most acceptable method of acquisition.&lt;ref name="Potter 184–188" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May (1973), pp. 56–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing the Manifesto==
[[File:James Buchanan.jpg|thumb|[[James Buchanan]] is believed to have authored the document.]]

Marcy suggested Soulé confer with Buchanan and [[John Y. Mason]], Minister to France, on U.S. policy toward Cuba. He had previously written to Soulé that, if Cuba's purchase could not be negotiated, "you will then direct your effort to the next desirable object, which is to detach that island from the Spanish dominion and from all dependence on any European power"—words Soulé may have adapted to fit his own agenda.&lt;ref name="Potter and Schoultz"&gt;Potter (1967), pp. 188–189; Schoultz (1998), pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Authors David Potter and Lars Schoultz both note the considerable ambiguity in Marcy's cryptic words,&lt;ref name="Potter and Schoultz" /&gt; and Samuel Bemis suggests he may have referred to Cuban independence, but acknowledges it is impossible to know Marcy's true intent.&lt;ref&gt;Bemis (1965), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Marcy had also written in June that the administration had abandoned thoughts of declaring war over Cuba. But Robert May writes, "the instructions for the conference had been so vague, and so many of Marcy's letters to Soulé since the ''Black Warrior'' incident had been bellicose, that the ministers misread the administration's intent."&lt;ref&gt;May (1973), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a minor disagreement about their meeting site, the three American diplomats met in [[Ostend]], [[Belgium]] from October 9–11, 1854, then adjourned to [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] for a week to prepare a report of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes (1893), pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting dispatch, which would come to be known as the Ostend Manifesto, declared that "Cuba is as necessary to the North American republic as any of its present members, and that it belongs naturally to that great family of states of which the Union is the [[Providential Nursery]]".&lt;ref name="Potter 190"&gt;Potter (1967), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent among the reasons for annexation outlined in the manifesto were fears of a possible slave revolt in Cuba parallel to the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804) in the absence of U.S. intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1996), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  The Manifesto urged against inaction on the Cuban question, warning,

&lt;blockquote&gt;We should, however, be recreant to our duty, be unworthy of our gallant forefathers, and commit base treason against our posterity, should we permit Cuba to be Africanized and become a second [[History of Haiti|St. Domingo]] (Haiti), with all its attendant horrors to the white race, and suffer the flames to extend to our own neighboring shores, seriously to endanger or actually to consume the fair fabric of our Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ostend Manifesto|Full text of the Ostend Manifesto at en.wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Racial fears, largely spread by Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Andrews|first = George Reid|title = Afro-Latin America, 1800–2000|place = [[Cary, NC]]|publisher = [[Oxford University Press, USA]]|date=June 2004|page = 113|isbn = 978-0-19-515232-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; raised tension and anxiety in the U.S. over a potential black uprising on the island that could "spread like wildfire" to the southern U.S.&lt;ref&gt;May (1973), pp. 57–59.&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifesto stated that the U.S. would be "justified in wresting" Cuba from Spain if the colonial power refused to sell it.&lt;ref name="Potter 190" /&gt;

Soulé was a former U.S. Senator from Louisiana and member of the Young America movement, who sought a realization of American influence in the Caribbean and Central America. He is credited as the primary architect of the policy expressed in the Ostend Manifesto. The experienced and cautious Buchanan is believed to have written the document and moderated Soulé's aggressive tone.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1955), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Soulé highly favored expansion of [[Southern United States|Southern]] influence outside the current Union of States. His belief in Manifest Destiny led him to prophesy "absorption of the entire continent and its island appendages" by the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1955), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Mason's Virginian roots predisposed him to the sentiments expressed in the document, but he later regretted his actions.&lt;ref name="Rhodes 40"&gt;Rhodes (1893), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan's exact motivations remain unclear despite his expansionist tendencies, but it has been suggested that he was seduced by visions of the presidency, which he would [[United States presidential election, 1856|go on to win in 1856]].&lt;ref&gt;May (1973), pp. 61–79.&lt;/ref&gt; One historian concluded in 1893, "When we take into account the characteristics of the three men we can hardly resist the conclusion that Soulé, as he afterwards intimated, twisted his colleagues round his finger."&lt;ref name="Rhodes 40" /&gt;

To Marcy's chagrin, the flamboyant Soulé made no secret of the meetings. The press in both Europe and the U.S. were well aware of the proceedings if not their outcome, but were preoccupied with wars and midterm elections.&lt;ref name="Rhodes 38"&gt;Rhodes (1893), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, the Democratic Party became a minority in the [[United States Congress]], and editorials continued to chide the Pierce administration for its secrecy. At least one newspaper, the ''[[New York Herald]],'' published what Brown calls "reports that came so close to the truth of the decisions at Ostend that the President feared they were based on leaks, as indeed they may have been".&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1980), pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce feared the political repercussions of confirming such rumors, and he did not acknowledge them in his [[State of the Union]] address at the end of 1854. The administration's opponents in the House of Representatives called for the document's release, and it was published in full four months after being written.&lt;ref name="Rhodes 38" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1980), pp. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fallout==
[[File:Ostend doctrine.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon depicts James Buchanan surrounded by hoodlums using quotations from the Ostend Manifesto to justify robbing him. The caption below reads "The Ostend Doctrine".]]
When the document was published, Northerners were outraged by what they considered a Southern attempt to extend slavery. American [[United States Free Soil Party|free-soilers]], recently angered by the strengthened [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]] (passed as part of the [[Compromise of 1850]] and requiring officials of free states to cooperate in the return of slaves), decried as unconstitutional what [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' labeled "The Manifesto of the Brigands."&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1980), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of [[Bleeding Kansas]], as anti- and pro-slavery supporters fought for control of the state, the Ostend Manifesto served as a rallying cry for the opponents of [[the Slave Power]]. The incident was one of many factors that gave rise to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and the manifesto was criticized in the Party's first platform in 1856 as following a "[[highwayman]]'s" philosophy of "might makes right." But, the movement to annex Cuba did not fully end until after the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Schoultz (1998), pp. 54–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pierce Administration was irreparably damaged by the incident. Pierce had been highly sympathetic to the Southern cause, and the controversy over the Ostend Manifesto contributed to the splintering of the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;May (1973), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, it was seen as a threat to Spain and to imperial power across [[Europe]]. It was quickly denounced by national governments in [[Madrid]], [[London]], and [[Paris]]. To preserve what favorable relations the administration had left, Soulé was ordered to cease discussion of Cuba; he promptly resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Potter (1967), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The backlash from the Ostend Manifesto caused Pierce to abandon expansionist plans. It has been described as part of a series of "gratuitous conflicts... that cost more than they were worth" for Southern interests intent on maintaining the institution of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Potter (1967), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Buchanan]] was easily elected President in 1856. Although he remained committed to Cuban annexation, he was hindered by popular opposition and the growing sectional conflict. It was not until thirty years after the Civil War that the so-called [[Cuba–United States relations#Independence in Cuba|Cuban Question]] again came to national prominence.&lt;ref&gt;May (1973), pp. 163–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''inauguration of the President of the Philippines''' is a ceremonial event marking the commencement of a new six-year term of a [[President of the Philippines]]. The day a presidential inauguration occurs is June 30 as mandated by the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]]. Under the previous 1935 Constitution, the date was December 30, which is also [[Rizal Day]]; the last inauguration to take place on the older date was [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' [[Second inauguration of Ferdinand Marcos|second one]] on December 30, 1969. The most recent public presidential inauguration ceremony, the swearing in of President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] to begin his six-year term in office, took place on Thursday, June 30, 2016.

The only inauguration element mandated by the Philippine Constitution is that the president make an oath or affirmation before that person can "enter on the Execution" of the office of the presidency. However, over the years, various traditions have arisen that have expanded the inauguration from a simple oath-taking ceremony to a day-long event, including parades, speeches, and balls.

When a new president takes over mid-term due to the death or resignation of a president, the oath of office is administered but formal, public inauguration events have not been held.

==Inauguration rites==
[[File:Manuel L Quezon Malacañang stairs.jpg|thumb|Manuel L. Quezon climbs up the Malacañang Palace stairs for the first time as the President of the Philippines in 1935.]]
The ceremony since 1992 traditionally begins with the President-Elect fetching the incumbent in [[Malacañan Palace]] on the morning of June 30. At the Palace's State Entrance, the President-Elect will wait for the incumbent to descend the Grand Staircase. Upon meeting at the foot of the staircase, the President-Elect would greet the incumbent.

Both travel to the Quirino Grandstand aboard any of the Presidential cars. Following protocol, the outgoing President takes the back right-hand seat of the vehicle, while the President-Elect is seated behind the chauffeur. At the Grandstand's parade grounds, the outgoing President will be welcomed with arrival honours, and then [[handshake|shake hands]] with the President-Elect. The outgoing President conducts a final [[Military parade|troop review]] and is presented to the public before departing the Grandstand aboard their own private vehicle. Only [[Corazon Aquino|Corazón Aquino]] broke with the custom of leaving the Grandstand immediately, choosing instead to stay until the end of [[Fidel Ramos]]'s inaugural speech. Ramos also attended the oath taking of Joseph Estrada and the inaugural ceremonies.

The inauguration proper then begins with the singing of the [[Lupang Hinirang|National Anthem]]. An ecumenical Invocation follows, led by leaders of the different [[Religion in the Philippines|major religions of the Philippines]], followed by a patriotic musical piece by a musical ensemble. Afterwards, [[President of the Senate of the Philippines]] reads the Joint Resolution of the Joint Congressional Board of Canvassers proclaiming the newly-elected President and Vice President. Since the [[History of the Philippines (1946–1965)|Third Republic]], the [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]]-Elect is sworn in before the President-Elect to immediately secure the [[Presidential line of succession|line of succession]]. During his inauguration, President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] took the Oath of Office first to mark a "new start".&lt;ref name="pangulo.ph"&gt;[http://pangulo.ph/]&lt;/ref&gt;

As mandated by the Constitution, the President-Elect then takes the Oath of Office at exactly 12:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]] ([[GMT+8]]); in 2010, President-Elect Aquino did not await noon, instead taking his Oath moments after Vice-President-Elect Binay finished doing so. The Oath is customarily administered by the [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines]], but that is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes for the coming inaugural|last=Quezon III|first=Manuel L.|url=http://www.quezon.ph/2010/05/31/the-long-view-notes-for-the-coming-inaugural|work=The Long View|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to political differences, Benigno Aquino III instead had then-Associate Justice [[Conchita Carpio-Morales]] administer the Oath instead of then-Chief Justice [[Renato Corona]]. A [[21-gun salute]] is then immediately fired, followed by four [[ruffles and flourishes]] and the [[Honors music|Presidential Anthem]], ''[[We Say Mabuhay]]'', is played in honour of the new President.

The new President then delivers an [[Inaugural address|Inaugural Address]]. Previous inaugurations also saw a full military and civil parade in the same manner as the Independence Day celebrations on 12 June (similar to the US Inaugural Parades) right after the address. From the late 1940s to the late 1960s, similar parades were also held on [[Rizal Day]] on 30 December as well and to ring in the New Year's celebrations that would start [[New Year's Eve|the day after]].

The new President then returns to Malacañan Palace to formally take possession of the residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://malacanang.gov.ph/1582-the-possession-of-malacanan-palace/ The Possession of Malacañan Palace], Presidential Museum and Library, June 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This formal entry is symbolised by the President ascending the Grand Staircase and proceeding to the Ceremonial Hall. [[Juan Luna]]'s painting, ''[[The Blood Compact]]'', is currently displayed at the top of the Staircase. The President then inducts the new Cabinet on the same day, and holds its first meeting immediately after.

In the evening, an Inaugural Reception is held for other officials and foreign dignitaries who wish to call on the new President. The customary banquets of either a ''[[vin d'honneur]]'' or an Inaugural Ball were abolished, in an effort to revert to the pre-[[Martial Law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] practise of simpler official receptions. The last Inaugural Ball was held in 1981 for Ferdinand Marcos' third inauguration, which was also the last time the ''Rigodon de Honor'' (a Hispanic dance analogous to a [[court dance]]) was performed; it was again danced on [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Independence Day]] of 2009. The President concludes the ceremonies with a toast, as a gesture of amity towards states that maintain diplomatic ties with the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ph/2012/01/12/briefer-on-the-vin-d-honneur/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Date===
The new President is to be inaugurated at noon of June 30 as currently mandated by the [[1987 Constitution]], but past ceremonies were held on different dates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/article7.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The first President, [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], was inaugurated on January 23, 1899, while Presidents under the [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]] were inaugurated at noon of [[Rizal Day]] (December 30). Only two Presidents under the 1935 Constitution were not inaugurated on December 30, namely, [[Sergio Osmeña]] and [[Manuel Roxas]]. Ferdinand Marcos changed the inauguration date to the present June 30, while his successors [[Corazon Aquino]] and [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] were inaugurated on February 25, 1986 and January 20, 2001, respectively, Aquino after the [[EDSA Revolution]] and Arroyo after the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001|EDSA II]].

===Location===
[[Image:Quirino Grandstand.jpg|thumb|right|900px|[[Quirino Grandstand]] is where most inaugurations take place.]]
Seven inaugurations have been held at the [[Quirino Grandstand]] in the [[Luneta]], namely, Quirino (1949), Magsaysay (1953), Garcia (1957), Macapagal (1961), Marcos (1965, 1969, 1981), Ramos (1992) and Aquino III (2010).&lt;ref name="malacanang-protocol"&gt;[http://malacanang.gov.ph/1608-the-protocol-ceremony-history-and-symbolism-of-the-presidential-inauguration/ The Protocol, Ceremony, History and Symbolism of the Presidential Inauguration on the Presidential Museum and Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Presidents Estrada and Arroyo only delivered their inaugural addresses there. To date, Estrada and Arroyo were the only presidents to take the oath of office and inaugural addresses in two different locations.

Other presidents, namely Aguinaldo and Estrada, were inaugurated at the [[Barasoain Church]] in Malolos, Bulacan; Quezon, Laurel and Roxas were inaugurated in front of the Legislative Building; and Aquino in [[Club Filipino]], Greenhills, San Juan, Metro Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes for the coming inaugural|last=Quezon III|first=Manuel L.|url=http://filipinopresidency.multiply.com/photos/album/6/Inaugurations#8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcos was inaugurated in Maharlika Hall, Malacañan Palace in 1986; and Duterte inaugurated in the Rizal Hall, Malacañan Palace in 2016. Arroyo took her first oath as president at the EDSA Shrine in [[Quezon City]]. Osmeña, who assumed the presidency upon the death of his predecessor Manuel L. Quezon, took his oath of office in Washington D.C. Quirino and Garcia took the oath of office in the [[Malacañan Palace]].

===Attendees===
In addition to the general public the following are the attendants of the Inauguration:
* The President and Vice-President-elects and their families
* Members of [[Philippine Congress|Congress]]
* Members of the [[Cabinet of the Philippines|President's Cabinet]]
* Justices of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]]
* Local officials
* Representatives of different countries and organisations
* usually the outgoing President and Vice-President
* Choir, orchestra, and other musical performers
* Representatives of the various religions of the country
* Security, headed by the [[Presidential Security Group]]
* [[Military band]] and [[honor guard]] from the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]]

If a civil-military parade follows the speech the format is the same as in the Independence Day parades, with the AFP first, with the units of the [[Philippine National Police]], [[Bureau of Fire Protection]] and the [[Philippine Coast Guard]] following them and later by civilian marchers representing the government, private sector, youth and youth uniformed organizations, national athletes and the representatives of the nation's religious sector and its various ethnic nationalities.

==Ceremonial==

===Oath of office===
Under Article VII, Section 5 of the [[1987 Constitution]], before the President-Elect and Vice-President-Elect enters into the execution of their offices, the President shall take the following oath or affirmation:

{{cquote|''I,_______________, do solemnly swear [or affirm] that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President [or Vice-President or Acting President] of the Philippines, preserve and defend its Constitution, execute its laws, do justice to every man, and consecrate myself to the service of the Nation. [[So help me God]].''
[''In case of affirmation, last sentence will be omitted.'']}}

The oath from the [[Filipino language|Filipino]] version of the Constitution was used for the inaugurations of Presidents [[Fidel V. Ramos]], [[Joseph Estrada]] and [[Benigno Aquino III]]:

{{cquote|''Ako, si_______________, ay taimtim kong pinanunumpaan [o pinatotohanan] na tutuparin ko nang buong katapatan at sigasig ang aking mga tungkulin bilang Pangulo [o Pangalawang Pangulo o Nanunungkulang Pangulo] ng Pilipinas, pangangalagaan at ipagtatanggol ang kanyang Konstitusyon, ipatutupad ang mga batas nito, magiging makatarungan sa bawat tao, at itatalaga ang aking sarili sa paglilingkod sa Bansa. [[So help me God|Kasihan nawa ako ng Diyos]].''
[''Kapag pagpapatotoo, ang huling pangungusap ay kakaltasin.'']&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Inaugural address===
{{Wikisource|Portal:Inaugural Speeches by Philippine Presidents}}
Every president since [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] delivered an inaugural address. Presidents, who became president upon the death of their predecessor, also delivered an address. It is usually delivered after the new president took the oath of office. However, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] delivered the inaugural address first at the [[Quirino Grandstand]] and then took the oath of office in [[Cebu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ops.gov.ph/inaugural2004/photo5.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of inaugural ceremonies==
Note: Vice President-elects usually take the oath of office with the President-elect, but [[Rodrigo Duterte]] broke tradition by requesting [[Leni Robredo|Vice President-elect Leni Robredo]] to hold inauguration rites separately.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/06/17/1593848/separate-inauguration-first-recent-history&lt;/ref&gt; The only other instances that the Vice President was inaugurated separately, when [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] succeeded to the presidency and nominated [[Teofisto Guingona]] as Vice President. Guingona was confirmed by Congress on February 9, 2001 and took the oath of office the same day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3511">'''Protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement''' (PADDD) are processes that change the legal status of national parks and other protected areas.  "Downgrading" is "a decrease in legal restrictions on the number, magnitude, or extent of human activities within a protected area (i.e., legal authorization for increased human use)."&lt;ref name="Mascia and Pailler 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mascia|first1=Michael B.|last2=Pailler|first2=Sharon|title=Protected Area Downgrading, Downsizing, and Degazettement (PADDD) and Its Conservation Implications|journal=Conservation Letters|date=2011|volume=4|issue=1|pages=9–20|doi=10.1111/j.1755-263x.2010.00147.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Downsizing" refers to a "decrease in size of a protected area as a result of excision of land or sea area through a legal boundary change."&lt;ref name="Mascia and Pailler 2011"/&gt; "Degazettement" is defined as a loss of legal protection for an entire national park or other protected area.&lt;ref name="Mascia and Pailler 2011"/&gt; Collectively, PADDD represents legal processes that temper regulations, shrink boundaries, or eliminate all legal protections originally associated with establishment of a protected area.

PADDD is a phenomenon that has recently gained attention among scientists and policymakers.&lt;ref name="Mascia and Pailler 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mascia et al. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mascia|first1=Michael B.|title=Protected Area Downgrading, Downsizing, and Degazettement (PADDD) in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, 1900–2010|journal=Biological Conservation|date=2014|volume=169|pages=355–361|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2013.11.021|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernard et al. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernard|first1=Enrico|title=Downgrading, Downsizing, Degazettement, and Reclassification of Protected Areas in Brazil|journal=Conservation Biology|date=2014|volume=28|issue=4|pages=939–950|doi=10.1111/cobi.12298|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific publications have identified more than 600 enacted PADDD events in 57 countries, encompassing a total of more than 550,000 km2 of protected lands.&lt;ref name="Mascia et al. 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernard et al. 2014"/&gt;

PADDD was a topic of discussion at the World Parks Congress in Sydney, Australia, in November, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN World Parks Congress Programme|url=http://www.worldparkscongress.org/|website=IUCN World Parks Congress|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have suggested that the global PADDD trend could be combatted via a systematic programme of protected area "upgrading," whereby conserved wild areas are expanded via the purchase or gazetting of surrounding territory.&lt;ref name=Pringle2017&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Robert M. |title=Upgrading protected areas to conserve wild biodiversity| url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22902 |journal=Nature |volume=546 |pages=91–99 |year=2017 |PMID=28569807 |doi=10.1038/nature22902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful examples of protected-area upgrading include [[Gorongosa National Park]] in Mozambique and the [[Guanacaste Conservation Area]] in Costa Rica.&lt;ref name=Pringle2017&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Robert M. |title=Upgrading protected areas to conserve wild biodiversity| url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22902 |journal=Nature |volume=546 |pages=91–99 |year=2017 |PMID=28569807 |doi=10.1038/nature22902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Founded in 2001, the party focused on local politics in [[Prague]], particularly [[Prague 1]],&lt;ref name="Prague politics player Public Affairs"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Prague politics player Public Affairs enters lower house |first= |last= |newspaper=[[Czech News Agency]] |date=29 May 2010 |url=http://praguemonitor.com/2010/05/31/prague-politics-player-public-affairs-enters-lower-house }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for most of its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Czech parties hold coalition talks |first= |last= |newspaper=[[Aljazeera]] |date=31 May 2010 |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/05/2010531155019929513.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Radek John was recruited as its chairman,&lt;ref name="Prague politics player Public Affairs" /&gt; and it emerged in late 2009 as a contender in the [[Czech legislative election, 2010|2010 election]], polling above the 5% threshold to win seats, and occasionally above [[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party|KDU-ČSL]] and the [[Green Party (Czech Republic)|Green Party]]. John competed with [[Karel Schwarzenberg]] for the title of the country's most popular politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A song by Marta |first= |last= |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=20 May 2010 |url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=16167808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the election, VV received 10.9% of the vote, easily surpassing the 5% [[election threshold|threshold]], and won 24 seats. The party entered into a governing coalition with the country's two other centre-right parties: the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] and [[TOP 09]].

== Party breakdown ==
In April 2011, [[Vít Bárta]], Czech Minister of Transport, was accused of bribery by his party colleagues, deputies Jaroslav Škárka, Stanislav Huml, and Kristýna Kočí, who were subsequently expelled from the party. The incident caused serious problems in the [[Petr Nečas's Cabinet|Czech government coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/koci-vyzvala-bartu-k-rezignaci-huml-vystoupil-z-klubu-john-mluvi-o-provokaci_198529.html?showTab=diskutovane|title=VV vyhnaly Kočí z klubu i ze strany a vyzvaly ji: Vzdej se mandátu|date=7 April 2011|publisher=[[Týden]]|language=Czech|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawsuit involving several members and deputies of the party began to be debated in court on 5 March 2012.&lt;ref name=cstv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/166899-zlomovy-okamzik-pro-vv-zacal-soud-s-bartou-a-skarkou/|title=Zlomový okamžik pro VV: Začal soud s Bártou a Škárkou|date=5 March 2012|work=[[Czech Television]]|publisher=[[ČT24]]|language=Czech|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vít Bárta was accused by the State Prosecution of bribery and Jaroslav Škárka of receiving a bribe.&lt;ref name=cstv/&gt;.

After Nečas's cabinet fell, some of the members of Public Affairs split and attempted to form another party called [[LIDEM]], wishing to continue their coalition with [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]] and [[TOP 09]]. The plan was to have [[Miroslava Němcová]] appointed as Prime minister and pass a vote of confidence. However, president [[Miloš Zeman]] refused and insted appointed [[Jiří Rusnok's Cabinet]], which was often mockingly called "Government of Zeman's friends". This cabinet, however, failed to get confidence from the Chamber. The opposition then called for a dissolution of the Chamber and early elections. Remaining deputies of Public affairs, despite realizing that their party is done for, as polls gave them near zero chance of keeping any seats, voted in favour, and the motion of dissolution was passed with 143 out of 200 votes.

On 3 September 2013, Bárta announced that Public Affairs would not be standing in the [[Czech legislative election, 2013|October 2013 legislative election]], leading to a split in the party's leadership. Some party members were later elected as candidates of [[Dawn - National Coalition|Dawn of Direct Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/312250-na-protest-proti-spojenectvi-s-okamurou-rezignovala-bartovi-polovina-vedeni-vv.html|title=Na protest proti spojenectví s Okamurou rezignovala Bártovi polovina vedení VV|date=3 September 2013|publisher=[[novinky.cz]]|language=Czech|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, in August 2015, the party finally annouced its dissolution. It's chairman Jiří Kohout stated, that the party no longer has enough money for its function. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/377459-veci-verejne-konci-premeni-se-na-spolek.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ralph Rumney''' (5 June 1934 – 6 March 2002) was an [[England|English]] artist, born in [[Newcastle Upon Tyne]].

In 1957 lifelong [[conscientious objector]] Rumney - he evaded [[National Service]] by going on the run in continental [[Europe]] - was one of the co-founders of the [[London Psychogeographical Association]]. This organization was, along with [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] and the [[Lettrist International]], involved in the formation of the [[Situationist International]]. Amongst those present at the founding in the [[Italy|Italian]] village of Cosio d'Arroscia were [[Walter Olmo]], [[Michèle Bernstein]] (later his second wife) [[Asger Jorn]], and [[Guy Debord]]. However, within seven months Rumney had been 'amiably' expelled from the SI by Debord for allegedly "failing to hand in a [[psychogeography]] report about [[Venice]] on time."

Rumney spent much of his life living as a wanderer, and was variously described as both a 'recluse' and a 'media whore', seeing his existence as a 'permanent adventure and endless experiment.' Rumney married [[Pegeen Guggenheim]], the daughter of [[Peggy Guggenheim]]. He moved, as his friend Guy Atkins said, "between penury and almost absurd affluence. One visited him in a squalid room in [[London]]'s [[Neal Street]], in a house shared with near down-and-outs. Next, one would find him in Harry's Bar in [[Venice]], or at a [[Max Ernst]] opening in [[Paris]]. He seemed to take poverty with more equanimity than riches." 

Ralph Rumney died of cancer at his home in [[Manosque]], [[Provence]], France, in 2002, aged 67.

The '''Rewards for Justice Program''' ('''RFJ''') is the [[counterterrorism]] [[Bounty (reward)|rewards]] program of the [[U.S. Department of State|U.S. Department of State's]] [[Diplomatic Security Service]]. The [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] is currently offering rewards for information that prevents or favorably resolves acts of international [[terrorism]] against U.S. persons or property worldwide. Rewards also may be paid for information leading to the [[arrest]] or [[conviction]] of terrorists attempting, committing, [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiring to commit]], or [[Accomplice|aiding and abetting]] in the commission of such acts. The Rewards for Justice Program has paid more than $145 million for information that prevented international terrorist attacks or helped bring to justice those involved in prior acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url = https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/about-rfj/success-stories.html | title = Success Stories | publisher = Rewards for Justice | location = Washington, DC, U.S.A.| accessdate = 11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Payment to an informant.jpg|thumb|left|A State Department representative publicly hands over a payment to an informant whose information led to the killing of [[Khadaffy Janjalani]] and [[Jainal Antel Sali, Jr.]], leaders of the Filipino militant group [[Abu Sayyaf]].]]

The program was established by the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism ([[Act of Congress|Public Law]] 98-533), and it is administered by the State Department's [[Bureau of Diplomatic Security]]. The Rewards for Justice Program was formerly known as the Counter-Terror Rewards Program, soon shortened to the HEROES program. In 1993, DS launched [https://web.archive.org/web/19970427223345/http://www.heroes.net/ www.hereos.net] to help publicize reward information. Brad Smith, a DSS special agent assigned to desk duty due to illness, served as the lone site administrator and program manager running the operation from his home.&lt;ref name="DOS_Briefing"&gt;[http://www.hri.org/news/usa/std/1999/99-01-26.std.html]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="DOS_Release"&gt;[https://1997-2001.state.gov/briefings/statements/1999/ps990126b.html]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1997, the site was getting more than one million hits a year from 102 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gcn.com/articles/1998/08/24/state-web-site-gathers-tips-on-embassy-blasts.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Smith is also credited with the idea to put photos of wanted terrorists on matchbook covers.&lt;ref name="DOS_Briefing"/&gt; DSS agents assigned to embassies and consulates throughout the world ensured that the matchbooks got wide distribution at bars and restaurants. 

The Director of the [[Diplomatic Security Service]] chairs an interagency committee which reviews reward candidates and then recommends rewards to the Secretary of State. The committee includes members from the staff of the [[United States National Security Council|White House National Security Council]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], and the U.S. State Department.

After the [[September 11 attacks]], the list of wanted terrorists increased dramatically, and rewards were also increased, as part of the U.S. efforts to capture [[al-Qaeda]] leadership. However, the plan has been largely ineffective against [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorists]].&lt;ref name=whitlock&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitlock |first=Craig |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/16/AR2008051603921.html?hpid=topnews |title=Bounties a Bust in Hunt for Al-Qaeda |newspaper=Washington Post |date=17 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest reward offered was $25 million for the leader of al-Qaeda, [[Osama bin Laden]], which had "attracted hundreds of anonymous calls but no reliable leads."&lt;ref name=whitlock/&gt; [[Osama bin Laden]] was shot and killed inside a private residential compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, by members of the [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operatives in a covert operation on May 1, 2011.

Robert A. Hartung, Assistant Director of Diplomatic Security's Threat Investigations and Analysis Directorate, announced on 2 September 2010 that the U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program is offering rewards of up to $5 million each for information that leads law enforcement or security forces to Hakimullah Mehsud and Wali ur Rehman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/m/ds/rls/rm/146728.htm |title=Diplomatic Security Service announces $5 million dollar reward |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/rm/2010/146597.htm |title=Briefing of USG efforts to disrupt and dismantle Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905023123/https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/rm/2010/146597.htm |archivedate=2010-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/ | title = Millions of dollars available for information leading to the capture of Terrorists | date = 27 May 2011 | publisher = DSS Rewards for Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/us-pressures-pakistan-ayman-zawahiri-militant-leaders/story?id=13701607 |title=U.S. Pressures Pakistan to Go After Ayman Zawahiri and Other Militant Leaders |publisher=ABC News |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented a list of "the five most wanted terrorists" to Pakistan;&lt;ref name=jipafm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/current-affairs/us-draws-uplist5-most-wanted-terrorists-to-be-hit_547497.html |title=US draws up a list of 5 most wanted terrorists to be hit - PTI |publisher=Moneycontrol.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the list included [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], [[Mohammed Omar]], [[Ilyas Kashmiri]], [[Atiyah Abd al-Rahman]] and [[Sirajuddin Haqqani]].&lt;ref name=jipafm /&gt; Each of these five have bounties issued against them by the program;&lt;ref name=jooboa&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/english/most-wanted/all-regions.html  |publisher=Rewards for Justice | title = Wanted for Terrorism  |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Kashmiri, who US Intelligence officials said they were 99% sure was killed in an airstrike in South Waziristan on June 3, 2011, was removed from the list.&lt;ref name=jooboa /&gt; Rahman was killed in an airstrike in [[North Waziristan]] in August 2011 and was removed from the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/world/asia/28qaeda.html | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | title = C.I.A.

[[File:2006 April BLOODMONEYPOSTER3 lg back.jpg|thumb|right|A Rewards for Justice bounty post]]
On December 22, 2011, RFJ announced a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to [[Ezedin Abdel Aziz Khalil]] (aka Yasin al-Suri), the leader of an al-Qaeda fundraising network in Iran that transfers money and recruits via Iranian territory to [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Offers $10M for Iran-Based Al Qaeda Financier |author= |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/12/22/us-offers-10m-for-iran-based-al-qeada-financier/ |agency=NewsCore |date=22 December 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the first time that RFJ offered a reward for information leading to a terrorist financier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/12/179654.htm |title=Briefing on New Rewards for Justice Reward Offer |author= |date=22 December 2011 |work= |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest Islamic terrorist leaders wanted by the program are [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], the leader of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State in Iraq and Syria]], for whom $25 million is offered, and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], the leader of al-Qaeda, at $25 million.

[[Smart City|Smart cities]] seek to implement [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT) in order to improve the efficiency and sustainability of urban spaces while reducing costs and resource consumption.&lt;ref name=Economist1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21585002-enthusiasts-think-data-services-can-change-cities-century-much-electricity?frsc=dg/a |title=Clever cities: The multiplexed metropolis |publisher=The Economist |date=2013-09-07 |accessdate=2015-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[surveillance]], smart cities monitor citizens through strategically placed sensors around the urban landscape, which collect data regarding many different factors of urban living. From these sensors, data is transmitted, aggregated, and analysed by governments and other local authorities in order to extrapolate information about the challenges the city faces in sectors such as [[crime prevention]],&lt;ref name=SantaCruz&gt;{{cite news |last=Baxter |first=Stephen |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/general-news/20120226/modest-gains-in-first-six-months-of-santa-cruzs-predictive-police-program |title=Modest gains in first six months of Santa Cruz's predictive police program |work=Santa Cruz Sentinel |date=2012-02-26 |accessdate=2015-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21582042-it-getting-easier-foresee-wrongdoing-and-spot-likely-wrongdoers-dont-even-think-about-it |title=Predictive policing: Don't even think about it |publisher=The Economist |date=2013-07-20 |accessdate=2015-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berg |first=Nate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/25/predicting-crime-lapd-los-angeles-police-data-analysis-algorithm-minority-report |title=Predicting crime, LAPD-style |work=The Guardian |date=2014-06-25 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; traffic management,&lt;ref name="Amsterdam2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Amsterdam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/projects |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ Projects |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; energy use &lt;ref name=Amsterdam /&gt; and waste reduction.

Such technology has been implemented in a [[Smart city#Flagship cases|number of cities]], including [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[Barcelona]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[Stockholm]]. Smart city technology has developed practical applications in improving effective [[law enforcement]], the optimization of transportation services,&lt;ref name=Metropticon&gt;{{cite journal |title=WELCOME TO THE METROPTICON: PROTECTING PRIVACY IN A HYPERCONNECTED TOWN |journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal |year=2014 |last=Finch |first=Kelsey |last2=Tene |first2=Omer |volume=41 |page=1581 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the improvement of essential infrastructure systems,&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; including providing local government services through e-Governance platforms.&lt;ref name=Paskaleva&gt;{{cite book |last=Paskaleva |first1=Krassimira |title=Smart Cities: Governing, Modelling and Analysing the Transition |chapter=E-Governance as an enabler of the smart city |editor-last=Deakin | editor-first=Mark |publisher=Taylor and Francis |date=2013-08-22 |page=77 |isbn=978-1135124144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This constant and omnipresent [[data transmission|transmission of data]]&lt;ref name=Hardy /&gt;  from disparate sources into a single government entity has led to concerns being raised of these systems turning into ‘electronic [[panopticon]]s’,&lt;ref name=Economist1 /&gt; where governments exploit data driven technologies in order to maximize effective surveillance of their citizens. Such criticism is drawn from privacy factors,&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; as the information sharing flows operate vertically between citizens and the government on a scale that undermines the concept of urban anonymity.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt;

== Law enforcement ==
The most discernible use of smart city technology for Government Surveillance arises in law enforcement, where critics consider the accumulation of intelligence through [[data collection]] strategies key to intelligence-based policing.&lt;ref name=Cahiers&gt;{{cite journal |title=Policing, Surveillance and law in a pre-crime society: Understanding the Consequences of Technology based strategies |journal=Cahiers Politiestudies |year=2011 |last=van Brakel |first= Rosamunde |last2=De Hert |first2=Paul |volume=3 |issue=20 |url=http://www.vub.ac.be/LSTS/pub/Dehert/378.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology available in smart cities includes extensive [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] installations (such as in London and Dubai),&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barrett |first=David |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10172298/One-surveillance-camera-for-every-11-people-in-Britain-says-CCTV-survey.html |title=One surveillance camera for every 11 people in Britain, says CCTV survey |work=The Telegraph |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; smart traffic sensors in New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hill |first=Kashmir |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/09/12/e-zpasses-get-read-all-over-new-york-not-just-at-toll-booths/ |title=E-ZPasses Get Read All Over New York (Not Just At Toll Booths) |work=Forbes |date=2013-12-09 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[crime prediction]] software in Santa Cruz, California.&lt;ref name=SantaCruz /&gt; This technology holds the potential to significantly improve the type and volume of information that may be relied upon by law enforcement authorities when dealing with crimes. Most policing technologies developed within smart cities appear to have shifted law enforcement from "displinary" to "actuarial",&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt; with less focus on identifying individual criminals in order to ascribe guilt and a tendency to classify and manage groups based on levels of dangerousness.

=== Policing Techniques ===

==== Proactive policing ====
{{Main|Proactive policing}}

[[File:Peak hour traffic in melbourne.jpg|thumbnail|right|Traffic Management is a major focus of proactive policing technologies.]]Garland's culture of control theory has been used to describe the trend towards proactive policing in smart cities.&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt; In Palestine, there have been proposals to introduce [[GPS]]-based [[tracking system]]s to cars for the purposes of law enforcement within a modern urban environment.&lt;ref name=GPS&gt;{{cite journal |title=SMART ON-BOARD TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING GPS/GSM/GPRS TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE TRAFFIC VIOLATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES |journal=International Journal of Digital Information and Wireless Communications |year=2014 |last=Tarapiah |first=Saed |last2=Atalla |first2=Shadi |last3=AbuHania |first3=Rajaa |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=96–105 |url=http://sdiwc.us/digitlib/request.php?article=7ac4779680a8d82fbbfbc133a6eda3d1 |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the location and speed of every vehicle is recorded and transmitted to the local authority, with a fine issued if the speed of the car exceeds the limit for more than 10 seconds.&lt;ref name=GPS /&gt; The technology also holds the potential to relay information regarding accidents and traffic jams,&lt;ref name=GPS /&gt; allowing traffic to be rerouted. An extensive camera system in Amsterdam relays data regarding the traffic situation to a central control point,&lt;ref name=Amsterdam2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/projects/detail/id/58/slug/smart-traffic-management |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ Smart traffic management |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing authorities to warn motorists of incidents ahead or adverse weather conditions.

Such technology has a combined preventative and deterrent effect on motorists committing traffic violations. By controlling the speed of vehicles, authorities may minimize one of the more common risk factors in vehicular crashes.&lt;ref name=ABS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/2f762f95845417aeca25706c00834efa/96781e47a4d2d886ca2570ec0073f6a9!OpenDocument |title=Special Features: Motor vehicle traffic accidents |author=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=2006-03-17 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, by monitoring the location of vehicles through a mix of GPS and camera technology, authorities are able to react in real time to minimize heavy traffic incidents and therefore the likelihood of crashes.&lt;ref name=Amsterdam2 /&gt; Such technology also enables police and emergency authorities to respond instantly to accidents that may occur. The extended ‘reach’ of the ‘long arm of the law’ could thus improve traffic management and efficiency, reducing energy consumption and improving civilians’ safety.

There is criticism of the use of smart city technology for proactive policing. The constant monitoring of every vehicle's location couples with the panopticon-like concept of continuous law enforcement&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; and introduces a level of individualistic paternalism,&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; where citizens are deemed incapable of obeying traffic laws voluntarily. More controversially, GPS tracking and camera monitoring may be inappropriately suited to other high-risk behaviour (such as drunk driving and fatigue),&lt;ref name=ABS /&gt; which are also major factors in traffic accidents. There are also implementation difficulties, as older vehicles lacking GPS equipment would not appear in data streams, severely reducing the accuracy of potential analyses. There is also the risk of arbitrariness within proactive policing. GPS-based speeding enforcement would hold an individual driving above the speed limit for 9 seconds innocent whilst exceeding the limit for 10 seconds would constitute an offence. Such arbitrary measures do not account for the differences in car performance and remove discretion from law enforcement. Extrapolating this lack of discretion across multiple areas of criminal law, with automatic enforcement being implemented as the norm, the potential for unfair outcomes and public dissatisfaction with such technology becomes evident, due to the relatively high risk of non-accountability by governments using these methods.&lt;ref name=Lyria&gt;{{cite journal |title=Using Big Data for Legal and Law Enforcement Decisions |journal=UNSW Law Journal |year=2014 |last1=Bennett Moses |first1=Lyria |last2=Chan |first2=Janet |volume=37 |issue=2 |page=643 |url=http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_bennett_moses_and_chan.pdf |accessdate=2015-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Predictive policing ====
{{Main|Predictive policing}}

Predictive techniques in policing are not new, as search warrants are a pre-existing example of authorities acting on the basis of [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] and prediction in contemporary communities&lt;ref name=Guthrie&gt;{{cite journal |title=Predictive Policing and Reasonable Suspicion |journal=Emory Law Journal |year=2012 |last=Ferguson |first=Andrew Guthrie |volume=62 |issue=2 |page=322 |url=http://law.emory.edu/elj/content/volume-62/issue-2/articles/predicting-policing-and-reasonable-suspicion.html |accessdate=2015-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of smart cities, predictive policing is the use of data analytics to determine potential locations of future crime.&lt;ref name=Guthrie /&gt; This data collection often occurs through smartphones carried around by urban populations. Through location-based services in smartphones, the movements of individuals can be tracked and scrutinized by authorities. This has the potential to be particularly effective in crowd control. By comparing the different velocities of individual smartphone users within a certain location, it is possible for law enforcement authorities to ascertain crowd density.&lt;ref name=Wirz&gt;{{cite journal |title=Probing crowd density through smartphones in city-scale mass gatherings |journal=EPJ Data Science |year=2013 |last=Wirz |first=Martin |last2=Franke |first2=Tobias |last3=Roggen |first3=Daniel |last4=Mitleton-Kelly |first4=Eve |last5=Lukowicz |first5=Paul |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjds17/fulltext.html |accessdate=2015-05-21 |doi=10.1140/epjds17 |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for targeted crowd management and prediction of dangers related to excessive crowding.&lt;ref name=Wirz /&gt; Police are thus able to take appropriate action (such as information broadcasting) in order to reduce the threat of injuries from incidents (such as crowd stampedes), as well as crowd related crime (such as thefts) from occurring.&lt;ref name=Wirz /&gt;

This type of policing also allows for law enforcement agencies to ‘predict’ where, when or by whom a crime may occur in the future and respond accordingly. [[Big data analysis|Big data analytical]] tools are used to identify patterns in crime,&lt;ref name=Guthrie /&gt; allowing authorities to map high risk areas, times and days for certain types of crime. Through such software, police are also able to create profiles of potential criminals and associated behaviours.&lt;ref name=Guthrie /&gt; Developments in technology within smart cities allow for the scope of predictions to be increased as well as the types of responses available to law enforcement bodies.

[[File:Downtown santa cruz, cropped.jpg|thumbnail|left|Santa Cruz has been the site of a number of predictive policing experiments.&lt;ref name=SantaCruz /&gt;]]Experiments conducted in response to a ‘predictive policing algorithm’ based on crime data in Santa Cruz, California, enabled police officers to identify the most likely time and place within a certain locality for a particular crime to be committed.&lt;ref name=SantaCruz /&gt; This allowed for targeted patrols to be made with a 4 percent decline in burglaries and 13 additional arrests being recorded within the first 6 months.&lt;ref name=SantaCruz /&gt; These figures are preliminary however, and do not account for unreported crime or crime that was prevented through increased police presence.

Although it is possible to envisage such law enforcement intervention as becoming the norm where smart city surveillance technologies have been adopted and implemented, predictive policing has raised a number of legal and non-legal controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/2f762f95845417aeca25706c00834efa/96781e47a4d2d886ca2570ec0073f6a9!OpenDocument |title=Special Features: Motor vehicle traffic accidents |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=2006-03-17 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the level of criminal activity in a particular area sufficient to warrant extra patrols is unclear when predicting the commission of offences. The point at which the probability of crime becomes statistically significant is one which legal scholars and courts alike have had trouble defining.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; Within this framework, there is a degree of arbitrariness upon which the weight of the predictive data analysis must be considered, as high crime areas can only be defined with reference to “low levels of crime”.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt;

Further, in the United States, searches and arrests must be made on grounds of reasonable suspicion under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. This means that officers must be able to “point to specific and articulable facts” that “warrant the intrusion”, or make a predictive judgment that the person is in possession of an item that related to the commission of an offence. Similar protections, though not constitutionally based, exist in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/leara2002451/s23.html |title=LAW ENFORCEMENT (POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES) ACT 2002 - SECT 23 |author=AustLII |work=New South Wales Consolidated Acts |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=O'HARA v CHIEF CONSTABLE RUC |vol=1997 2 WLR 1 |court=House of Lords |url=https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofLaw/Research/HumanRightsCentre/Resources/EHRIS/EHRISHumanRightsMaterialsonNorthernIreland/NationalCaseLaw/ncasefilestore/Filetoupload,414776,en.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was confirmed as binding by the European Court of Human Rights&lt;ref name="Gillan"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=GILLAN AND QUINTON v.

The ability to formulate such “reasonable suspicion” on the basis of big data algorithms is controversial, with some critics arguing that in the absence of active police corroboration of predictive forecasts, there are insufficient grounds to warrant an arrest.&lt;ref name=Guthrie /&gt; Further, the general nature of predictive forecasts is arguably incompatible with the acceptable standards outlined by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]&lt;ref name=Guthrie /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Draper v.

In addition, a major factor in Europe is that predictive policing technology must be exercised in accordance with legislation that is sufficiently clear on the scope of use (foreseeability) and affords persons adequate legal protection from arbitrary uses of predictive data algorithms.&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt;

[[File:5.29.10NYPDByLuigiNovi6.jpg|thumbnail|A data-driven stop and frisk program in New York was found to constitute racial profiling.]]Non-legal controversies also arise over the passive [[discrimination]] that predictive policing programs can generate.

== Mass surveillance ==
{{Main|Mass surveillance}}

The concept of smart cities is inherently tied to mass surveillance. The benefits derived from smart city technology are dependent on constant data flows captured and aggregated by sensors, cameras and tracking applications.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; This persistence surveillance however, raises a number of privacy issues. Mass surveillance through big data acts in a manner that reduces urban anonymity,&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; due to the breadth of information and potential uses which can be extrapolated when multiple data streams are analysed together by a single governmental entity. Advocates of smart cities (such as [[Vint Cerf]]) state that this is akin to the level of privacy experienced in small towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cerf |first=Vint |contribution=Keynote Address |title=Internet of Things Workshop |editor-last=Gilley |editor-first=Stephanie |publisher=Federal Trade Commission |place=Washington, DC |pages=118–153 |date=2013-11-19 |contribution-url=http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/internet-things-privacy-security-connected-world/final_transcript.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, critics state that information sharing in smart cities has shifted from horizontal information flows between citizens to a vertical, unilateral process between citizen and government, reflecting concerns about panopticism.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt;

=== Data collection ===

Smart city applications often collate and analyse distinct sources of data in order to improve government services to operate more efficiently and effectively. Urban residents have few alternatives other than to subscribe to these services, particularly when making use of essential infrastructure, and thus indirectly and involuntarily consent to the sensors and surveillance technologies deployed throughout the urban environment through the mere act of residency.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; In Amsterdam, wireless meters collect data about energy usage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/projects/detail/id/61/slug/energy-storage-for-households |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ Energy storage for households |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Mobypark app allows for the advertisement and renting of available parking spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/projects/detail/id/64/slug/smart-parking |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ Smart parking |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The information collected across these and over 70 other projects in Amsterdam is stored by the City of Amsterdam via a common IP infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Komninos&gt;{{cite book |last=Komninos |first1=Nicos |title=Smart Cities: Governing, Modelling and Analysing the Transition |chapter=What makes cities intelligent? |editor-last=Deakin | editor-first=Mark |publisher=Taylor and Francis |date=2013-08-22 |page=77 |isbn=978-1135124144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that data from these services is accessible by a primary governmental body it allows for the possibility of data which is collected from these ‘distinct’ sources to be aggregated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Reilly |first1=Tim |url=http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000774/ch02.html |title=Open Government |chapter=Chapter 2: Government as a platform |editor-last=Lathrop |editor-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Ruma |editor2-first=Laurel |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2010 |accessdate=2015-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Big data analysis ===
{{See also|Big data}}
Big data often refers to the use of data analysis and mapping algorithms generate valuable insights from seemingly disparate datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayer-Schonberger |first1=Viktor |last2=Cukier |first2=Kenneth |title=Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How we Live, Work and Think |chapter=1 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing |year=2013 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of applying such analysis to aggregated data sets are that they allow for a more holistic view of the needs of a particular community to be formed. Within smart cities, this data can be used as a reflexive tool when implemented within the urban ICT framework&lt;ref name=Loet&gt;{{cite book |last=Leydesdorff |first1=Loet |title=Smart Cities: Governing, Modelling and Analysing the Transition |chapter=Triple Helix Model of Smart Cities: A neo evolutionary perspective |editor-last=Deakin | editor-first=Mark |publisher=Taylor and Francis |date=2013-08-22 |page=77 |isbn=978-1135124144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the Government to better meet the goals of smart cities – improved livability, efficiency and sustainability.&lt;ref name=Economist1 /&gt; Such benefits were found in Barcelona, where tracking of residents commuting patterns led to a revamp and simplification of the city’s bus routes.&lt;ref name=BCN1 /&gt; Combined with the implementation of smart traffic lights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartcity.bcn.cat/en/smart-traffic-lights.html |title=Smart traffic lights |author=BCN Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow for central control, buses in Barcelona now run to a schedule that attempts to minimize the amount of time spent waiting at traffic lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://sydney.edu.au/business/itls/research/2015/yes_you_can_erase_your_bus_network |title=Yes, You Can Erase Your Bus Network and Design a New One. Lessons from Houston, Auckland, and other cities |last=Walker |first=Jarrett |publisher=INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS STUDIES |agency=The University of Sydney |date=2015-05-12 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big data analysis is not without flaws in its approach This is particularly true when applied to law enforcement, or where data is collected without the willing cooperation and consent of parties involved. Critics argue that there is an element of "mythology" surrounding big data that larger data sets offer deeper insights into urban issues with higher levels of accuracy and objectivity.&lt;ref name=Lyria /&gt;

==== Reliability ====

The increasing significance attributed to big data analytics, particularly within smart cities, gives rise to a situation where government bodies place an ‘almost faith-based’ reliance upon the veracity of results that have been predicted by analyzing surveilled data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=RE-CONCEPTUALISING PRIVACY AND DISCRIMINATION IN AN AGE OF TALENT ANALYTICS |journal=UNSW Law Journal |year=2014 |last=Burdon |first=Mark |last2=Harpur |first2=Paul |volume=37 |issue=2 |url=http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/final_t3_de_zwart_humphreys_and_van_dissel.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of critical insight however, reliance on data alone has little support, as seen in the legal doctrine of reasonable suspicion.&lt;ref name=Guthrie /&gt; Traditionally, decisions to apprehend or search an individual in sole reliance upon personal “hunches” were deemed to fail the legal standard of reasonable cause.&lt;ref name=Guthrie /&gt; In this regard, it is difficult to see how data-driven hunches can be considered more reliable.&lt;ref name=Guthrie /&gt; Both elicit assumptions being made based on inferences drawn from observable data, which can be falsified or otherwise inaccurate, undermining the integrity of the process.&lt;ref name=DeZwart&gt;{{cite journal |title=Surveillance, Big Data and Democracy: Lessons for Australia from the US and UK’ |journal=UNSW Law Journal |year=2014 |last=De Zwart |first=Melissa |last2=Humphreys |first2=Sal |last3=Van Diesel |first3=Beatrix |volume=37 |issue=2 |url=http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t2_burdon_and_harpur.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the increasing role played by data-based surveillance for the purposes of law enforcement foresee that such reliance could lead to issues in prosecuting individuals based on a probability-based crime system.&lt;ref name=Guthrie /&gt; Furthermore, such a system holds the potential for  conclusions to be drawn by attributing weighting to certain characteristics  of an individual – an approach which could inadvertently mask any discriminatory agendas held by law enforcement bodies potentially targeting certain minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf |format=PDF |title=Big Data: Seizing Opportunities, Preserving Values |author=Executive Office of the President |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2015-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the potential for discrimination, many big data algorithms often create new categories that exceed the scope of regulations designed to prevent against the unfair or discriminatory use of data.&lt;ref name=DeZwart /&gt;

Outside law enforcement, critics argue that smart cities facilitate a shift to [[e-governance]] platforms, often at the expense of physical interactions with citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deakin |first1=Mark |title=Smart Cities: Governing, Modelling and Analysing the Transition |chapter=Embedded Intelligence of Smart Cities |editor-last=Deakin | editor-first=Mark |publisher=Taylor and Francis |date=2013-08-22 |page=77 |isbn=978-1135124144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While e-governance can improve service delivery and expand the ability to collect data from a single platform,&lt;ref name=Paskaleva /&gt; such processes may be at the expense of competitiveness and based merely on a technology push for more data sources and [[data aggregation|aggregation]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Komninos /&gt; As a result, the desire for increased surveillance undermines a fundamental aim of most smart cities to improve efficiency and effectiveness, as the citizens’ desire for certain ICT applications is ignored at the expense of further data aggregation. An example of this controversy has arisen in the UK, where proposals for a Scottish identity card were met with public outcry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carrell |first=Severin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/02/scottish-identity-database-plans-privacy-risk-ministers-warned |title=Scottish identity database plans carry privacy risk, ministers warned |work=The Guardian |date=2015-03-03 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while similar cards have been implemented in Southampton&lt;ref name=Southampton /&gt; with little trouble, as many city services are provided in exchange for data collection.

=== Privacy and autonomy ===
[[File:Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|left|In some situations, privacy may be lessened by surveillance.]]

The normalization of the collection and aggregation of big data&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; by Governments raises issues of [[privacy]] and [[autonomy]]. Part of this is fuelled by [[feature creep]], where technologies and applications that were perceived to be ‘creepy’ until recently have now become socially acceptable.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; Much of the concern surrounds the inconvenience and inability for citizens to opt out of new technologies where they form part of essential government services, as there are few alternatives.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; Should an individual wish to appear “off the grid” they are forced to employ a range of tedious measures (such as paying in cash only and  not utilizing a mobile phone) in order to reduce their data footprint.&lt;ref name=OffTheGrid&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.offthegridnews.com/privacy/how-to-stay-off-the-surveillance-radar/ |title=How To Stay Off The Surveillance Radar |last=Jennings |first=Daniel |work=OffTheGridNews |accessdate=2015-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, such tactics would only minimize and not eliminate their collectable data.&lt;ref name=OffTheGrid /&gt;

Privacy concerns are raised where the data collected may be capable of linking to or identifying an individual,&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite journal |title=The collision between Big Data and privacy law |journal=Australian Journal of Telecommunications and the Digital Economy |year=2014 |last=Wilson |first=Stephen |volume=2 |issue=3 |ssrn=2548079 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when collated from multiple information sources. The storage of data by governments remains opaque, while the potential for cross-sharing data across government services often means that data is accessible by parties that the provider did not intend to share the data with.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; By mere participation as a member of an urban community, particularly through the use of essential urban services and infrastructure, an individual is placed at risk of having their data shared amongst multiple platforms and users. While individually such data may not identify the person providing it, when combined with other data in the set, such data may be considered as [[personally identifiable information]] (PII), and thus fall under strict privacy laws.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; The constantly evolving uses of smart cities technology do not often fit neatly into privacy law frameworks,&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; which may be extremely broad, like in Australia,&lt;ref name=ALRC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/6.%20The%20Privacy%20Act%3A%20Some%20Important%20Definitions/what-not-%E2%80%98personal-information%E2%80%99 |title=The Privacy Act: Some Important Definitions |author=Australian Law Reform Commission |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where a discussion paper published by the Australian Law Reform Commission confirmed that anonymised data may still be PII.&lt;ref name=ALRC /&gt; Similar regimes exist in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104256 |title=Rules and Policies - Protecting PII - Privacy Act |author=US General Services Administration |publisher=US Government |date=2014-12-19 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Union (see: [[Data Protection Directive]]). In Europe, Government technology that interferes on privacy must be based on a "pressing social need" or otherwise "necessary in a democratic society" and be proportional to the legitimate aims espoused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=S. AND MARPER V. THE UNITED KINGDOM |court=The European Court of Human Rights |date=2008-12-04 |url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-90051}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that authorities implementing smart cities regimes are at risk of violating privacy laws if appropriate safeguards are not taken. The European Court of Human Rights has held that surveillance mechanisms (including those implemented in smart cities technologies) can violate the right to privacy, especially where domestic legislation does not define the scope or manner of surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=LIBERTY AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM |court=The European Court of Human Rights |date=2008-07-01 |url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-87207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, individuals may find that their data has been used illegally in the implementation of smart cities technology. As much smart city technology is based on open platforms that are often outsourced&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; to private citizens and corporations, there are massive risks that PII may be unlawfully shared to third parties. Compounded with the relative opaqueness of data storage by governments, critics argue that individual privacy can be curtailed massively through residence in a smart city with little recourse for individuals.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt;

Government surveillance is arguably driven by paternalistic desires to protect citizens,&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; however the individualistic and tailor-made benefits delivered by smart city technology may reduce autonomy. This holds particularly true in light of the shift towards predictive policing that occurs within the smart city environment. Whilst nobly intended, such unilateral actions by a Government may be seen as oppressive&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; – with the omnipotent role assumed by the Government seen as giving rise to that of a panoptic institution.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; Modern cities are increasingly valuing privacy and digital security, as evidenced by the latest “The Economist Safest Cities Index 2015”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://safecities.economist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/EIU_Safe_Cities_Index_2015_white_paper-20.02.15.pdf |format=PDF |title=The safe cities index 2015 |work=Intelligence Unit |publisher=The Economist |date=2015-02-20 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where a Digital Security metric was incorporated alongside traditional measures of safety such as Personal Security and Health.

=== Panopticism ===
{{See also|Panopticism|Panopticon}}[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Multiview orthographic projection#Elevation|Elevation]], [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|section]] and [[Multiview orthographic projection#Plan|plan]] of Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon penitentiary, drawn by [[Willey Reveley]], 1791]]
The English philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] created a circular prison design, known as the [[Panopticon]], whereby prisoners knew that they were capable of being observed at any time without their knowledge – thus affording the prison officers a position of omnipresence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bentham |first1=Jeremy |title=Proposal for a New and Less Expensive mode of Employing and Reforming Convicts |location=London |year=1798 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] re-conceptualized the notion of a panopticon as a metaphor for a ‘disciplinary society’, wherein power relations (and imbalances) can be defined and reinforced.&lt;ref name=Discipline&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucault |first1=Michel |title=Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison |year=1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a society power is seen to approach its ideal form by increasing the number of people who can be controlled.&lt;ref name=Discipline /&gt;

In this regard, the development of smart cities and the resulting increase in the surveillance capacity of the Government gives rise to conditions which mirror that of the disciplinary society described by Foucault. To this end, the development of smart cities are seen by its critics to foreshadow a larger societal shift - particularly the role adopted by the Government - towards mass surveillance, paternalism, discipline and punishment as a means to attain social order,&lt;ref name=Discipline /&gt; particularly in the United States, where the “Internet of Things” is being used to collect increasingly specific data.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; The [[commodification]] of surveillance in exchange for services has tended to normalise data collection and create indifference to panoptic developments in technology.&lt;ref name=Giroux&gt;{{cite journal |year=2015 |last=Giroux |first=Henry |title=Totalitarian Paranoia in the Post-Orwellian Surveillance State |journal=Cultural Studies  |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=108–140 |doi=10.1080/09502386.2014.917118}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major issues with Panopticism in the Smart Cities context is that the 'surveillance gaze' is mediated by the selective biases of the operators of any application or technology, as was shown by a study on the use of CCTV cameras in the UK, where the "usual suspects" tended to be targeted more frequently.&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt; In [[Durban]], this panoptic "gaze" extends based on CCTV operator intuition due to a normalisation of the characteristics of criminals.&lt;ref name=Hentschel&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |last=Hentschel |first=Christine |title=Making (In)Visible: CCTV, Living Cameras, and Their Objects in a Post-Apartheid Metropolis |journal=International Criminal Justice Review  |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=289–303 |doi=10.1177/1057567707311583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding these issues, digitally based panopticism usually views the "visibility" of undesirable characteristics as the problem, and often fails to adequately address matters that are invisible to the surveillance gaze.&lt;ref name=Hentschel /&gt;

=== Police state ===

{{See also|Surveillance state}}

If a shift toward mass surveillance came to fruition, it could give rise to the development of an [[Mass surveillance#Electronic police state|electronic police state]] as a result of the increased surveillance capabilities and law enforcement activities. This represents a distinct narrowing of the purpose of surveillance to that of maintaining social order via improved law enforcement. Van Brakel argues that these changes have already taken place, and that the focus of police has gradually moved towards "front-loading" their intelligence systems with relevant knowledge that can be later sorted and used,.&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt; Supporting this institutionalised shift, the House of Lords in the UK argued in 2009 that an advantage of surveillance activities is the ability for the government to provide a more tailored approach to governance,&lt;ref name =HouseofLords /&gt; and by extension, law enforcement.

== Solutions ==

In seeking  a middle ground between the societal benefits afforded by big data and the resulting loss of privacy and autonomy, academics have proposed a number of solutions.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; Deakin argues that “smart cities” are not simply those that utilize ICT, but where such intelligence is tailored to meet the needs of citizens through community and environmental drivers.&lt;ref name=DeakinIntro&gt;{{cite book |last=Deakin |first1=Mark |title=Smart Cities: Governing, Modelling and Analysing the Transition |chapter=Introduction to smart cities |editor-last=Deakin | editor-first=Mark |publisher=Taylor and Francis |date=2013-08-22 |page=15 |isbn=978-1135124144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Komninos refers to the three layers of intelligence in smart cities&lt;ref name=Komninos /&gt; as the artificial intelligence of smart city infrastructure, the collective intelligence of the city’s institutions and the intelligence of the city’s populations. By integrating these layers in the implementation process, smart cities may be able to overcome the issues of government opacity that plague them. One of the issues with establishing a legal framework for smart city technology is determining whether to take a technology-specific or technology-neutral approach.&lt;ref name=Nicholls&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sketching and validating the location-based services (LBS) regulatory framework in Australia |journal=Computer Law and Security Review |year=2013 |last=Abbas |first=Roba |last2=Michael |first2=Katina |last3=Michael |first3=M.G. |last4=Nicholls |first4=Rob |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=576–589 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237011560_Sketching_and_validating_the_location-based_services_%28LBS%29_regulatory_framework_in_Australia |accessdate=2015-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many technologies have developed too rapidly to be covered by a single technology-specific regime, while a technology-neutral approach risks being too ambiguous to encourage use or development of the regulated technology.&lt;ref name=Nicholls /&gt; Further, most applications are too benign to be regulated, while other more controversial technologies tend to be enabled by the creation of legislation, such as the ''[[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]]'', which established scenarios where police were able to carry out surveillance, with or without authorisation.&lt;ref name = Cahiers /&gt; A challenge to these laws is currently pending in the European Court of Human Rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=BIG BROTHER WATCH AND OTHERS V.

Studies conducted by Deakin and Campbell in 2005 identified three types of interaction between citizens and smart cities.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first1=Ian |last2=Lombardi |first2=Patrizia|last3=Deakin |first3=Mark|title=Smart Cities: Governing, Modelling and Analysing the Transition |chapter=The IntelCities community of practice |editor-last=Deakin | editor-first=Mark |publisher=Taylor and Francis |date=2013-08-22 |page=15 |isbn=978-1135124144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that citizens desire accessible and reliable information and seamless and responsive governments during transactions.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; Further, any consultation with the community needed to be transparent and based on democratic engagement and accountability.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; Bennett Moses et al. hold that the success of data-driven technologies is based on technical, social and normative dimensions.&lt;ref name=Lyria /&gt; This means that smart city technologies must satisfy citizens of their effectiveness, have a major beneficial impact that encourages uptake and align with generally acceptable ethics and values.&lt;ref name=Lyria /&gt;

=== Access ===

A potential solution to bridge the divide between the competing benefits and costs of big data surveillance is to turn the management of personal information into a ‘joint venture’.&lt;ref name=Tene&gt;{{cite journal |title=Big Data for All: Privacy and User Control in the Age of Analytics |journal=Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property |year=2013 |last=Tene |first=Omer |last2=Polonetsky |first2=Jules |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=263–270 |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1191&amp;context=njtip |accessdate=2015-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing awareness of how, where and why data is collected by the Government establishes the groundwork for a non-adversarial approach to the use of data within smart cities.&lt;ref name=Tene /&gt; [[File:Barcelona collage.JPG|thumbnail|Barcelona is a city that has embraced smart city technology while maintaining public access.]]This process minimizes perceptions of secrecy,&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; and cities that invest in multiple points of access, such as Barcelona with its Open Government platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartcity.bcn.cat/en/barcelona-open-government.html |title=Open government |author=BCN Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have seen growth in the use of smart city applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartcity.bcn.cat/en |title=Barcelona Smart City |author=BCN Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, this process has developed to allow individuals to access their own data in a usable format,&lt;ref name=Tene /&gt; as seen through Barcelona’s Open Data project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartcity.bcn.cat/en/open-data.html |title=Open data |author=BCN Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way autonomy is regained both in relation to awareness of how an individual is affected by the collection of data as well as participation in the actual application of this data to generate information, as new technologies are developed.

=== Accountability ===

In addition to general awareness of the intended purpose of data collection ‘before the fact’, accountability processes ‘after the fact’ are also required.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; A potential measure is for responsible parties to be notified where some sort of discriminatory decision is made, thus allowing appropriate action to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wolf |first=Christopher |last2=Polonetsky |first2=Jules |url=http://www.futureofprivacy.org/wp-content/uploads/Wolf-and-Polonetsky-An-Updated-Privacy-Paradigm-for-the-%E2%80%9CInternet-of-Things%E2%80%9D-11-19-2013.pdf |format=PDF |title=An Updated Privacy Paradigm for the "Internet of Things" |work=The Future of Privacy Forum |date=2013-11-19 |accessdate=2015-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In data-driven processes, particularly in the fields of law enforcement, it is difficult to attribute responsibility to a single body or source, as often the information is derived from a number of different locations.&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt; Further, opacity is often essential to predictive policing technologies, as transparency may encourage potential offenders to alter their behaviour to avoid detection.&lt;ref name=Lyria /&gt;

Transparency processes however remain crucial to ensure that a panoptic view or electronic police state cannot be imposed, as it allows for a review of how decisions are made in relation to them and what criteria this is based upon. Accountability is particularly relevant in the implementation stage

==== Implementation ====

The implementation stage of smart city technology is considered to be crucial, as the applications and platforms must be grounded in the “social capital, environmental and cultural attributes of the communities they represent”.&lt;ref name=DeakinAl&gt;{{cite journal |title=From Intelligent to Smart Cities |journal=Journal of Intelligent Buildings International: From Intelligent Cities to Smart Cities |last=Deakin |first=Mark |last2=Al Waer |first2=Husam |volume=3 |issue=3 |doi=10.1080/17508975.2011.586671 |pages=140–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paskaleva notes that e-governance platforms are particularly suited to democratically generating community support where residents are able to participate in the [[decision making]] and implementation process.&lt;ref name=Paskaleva /&gt; Confirming this, studies by Deakin et al. highlight that community backlash to smart city technology is minimized where e-government services are co-designed by governments and communities.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; An example of collaboration at an extreme level was seen in Bletchley Park, where the Nazi Enigma cypher was decoded in what is often referred to as the first smart city.&lt;ref name=Komninos /&gt;  More recently, citizen participation has been encouraged in Edinburgh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myedinburgh.org.uk |title=The City of Edinburgh Community Network |work=myEdinburgh |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where citizens are invited to ICT ‘taster’ sessions in local venues, enabling them to learn about the planning, development and design of new smart city technologies.&lt;ref name=DeakinAl /&gt; Such partnerships incorporate elements of democracy&lt;ref name=DeakinAl /&gt; and highlight how digitally inclusive decision making generates the requisite level of trust to support the implementation of smart city technology. Trust acts as an empowering and engaging mechanism for citizens according to Finch and Tene.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; This empowerment intelligence allows citizens to upskill&lt;ref name=Komninos /&gt; and assist in the development of innovative smart city networks, addressing areas not contemplated by authorities. In Hong Kong, such development takes place in the Cyberport Zone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberport.hk/en/about_cyberport/about_overview |title=About Cyberport |publisher=Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Amsterdam, “Smart Citizens Labs”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/news/detail/id/565/slug/amsterdam-smart-citizens-lab-3 |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ Smart citizens lab |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are designed for interaction between citizens and government. These mechanisms have resulted in large levels of enthusiasm for smart city technology,&lt;ref name=Paskaleva /&gt; as evidenced by the numerous crowd-sourced Amsterdam Smart City projects to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/ |title=Amsterdam Smart City  |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kistavictoriahotelnr1 Publish.jpg|thumbnail|[[Kista]] has implemented smart city technology using the Triple Helix Model with positive outcomes. ]]The Triple Helix Model for Smart cities, combining university, industry and government&lt;ref name=Loet /&gt; in the development process is regarded as a potential benchmark for smart city development and implementation. Kourtit et al. advance that this model implements the knowledge generated from collaboration to tailor smart city applications to market needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kourtit |first1=Karima |last2=Lombardi |first2=Patrizia |last3=Deakin |first3=Mark |last4=Caragliu |first4=Andrea |last5=Del Bo |first5=Chiara |last6=Nijkamp |first6=Peter |last7=Giordano |first7=Silvia |title=Smart Cities: Governing, Modelling and Analysing the Transition |chapter=Advanced Triple Helix Network Framework for Smart Cities Performance |editor-last=Deakin | editor-first=Mark |publisher=Taylor and Francis |date=2013-08-22 |page=15 |isbn=978-1135124144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical studies conducted on smart cities in the Netherlands compared the level of ICT penetration to the city’s level of smartness under the Triple Helix Metric, finding a strong positive correlation. A live example of the Triple Helix Model in practice can be seen in the Kista Science City business cluster in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://international.stockholm.se/International-Relations/professional-study-visits/8-ict-information-and-communication-technology1 |title=ICT (Information and Communication Technology) |author=City of Stockholm |publisher=Stockholms stad |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Underpinned by the Stokab Model of government provisioned dark fibre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/toolkit/notes/PracticeNote/3244/ |title=Models for Infrastructure Sharing: Sweden’s Stokab |author=ICT Regulation Toolkit |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 1000 companies&lt;ref name=Kista&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stockholmitregion.com/2012/11/12/stockholms-it-nodes-part-1-kista-science-city/ |title=Stockholm’s IT nodes part 1: Kista Science City |work=Stockholm IT Region |date=2012-11-12 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including multinational [[Ericsson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kim |first1=Junmo |title=Globalization and Industrial Development |date=2005-07-10 |page=73 |isbn=978-1469723938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and Stockholm University reside in Kista,&lt;ref name=Kista /&gt; which has grown to become the largest corporate area in Sweden. The success of Kista highlights the usefulness of the Triple Helix Model in Smart City implementation and provides a potential platform for cities seeking to introduce smart city technology in a manner that optimizes resident uptake.

=== Anonymity ===

When considering the potential for privacy law breaches, particularly within the smart cities context containing a vast scope of data that is available to the Government, data may often need to be de-identified to maintain privacy.&lt;ref name=Metropticon /&gt; Whilst this may make it difficult to reconcile data collected from multiple services, it could still allow for the useful collection and aggregation of data for defined purposes. The E-CAF system (Common Assessment Framework),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protectingchildren.org.uk/cp-system/child-in-need/caf |title=Common Assessment Framework |author=Coram Children's Legal Centre |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where a database of all children assessed by government services (including police, social services and schools) is maintained by the UK Government, highlights how anonymity is fading due to data-driven technologies.&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt; The system allows authorities to predict which children will commit crime in the future and allow them to intervene, based on a number of risk factors and profiling.&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt; It is evident that citizens captured by the database as children will no longer be "anonymous" members of society. Given the potential Government presumption that parties unwilling to share their information are inherently suspicious,&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt; the difficulty of maintaining anonymity in modern smart cities is clearly quite high.

'''Mauricio Borensztein''' (27 April 1927 – 11 January 1996), known by the stage name '''''Tato Bores''''', was an [[Argentine]] film, theatre and television comedian, who specialized in [[political satire|political humor]]. His ironic TV [[monologue]]s, delivered at a fast pace, became a reference point for generations of [[People of Argentina|Argentines]].

== Biography ==
He was born into a family of [[Polish Jewish ]] heritage. He took his first steps into the humor field in 1957, after the [[Revolución Libertadora|fall]] of [[Juan Perón]], debuting in state-owned [[Canal 7 Argentina|Channel 7]]. When in character, he wore dress coat, white bow tie and a deliberately badly cut wig, and waved a cigar. Besides the monologues, at some point during each show he pretended to dial the number of the [[Casa Rosada]] and speak to the [[President of Argentina|President]] (whoever it was at the time), asking pointed questions or commenting on uncomfortable news.

Near the end of his life, Borensztein abandoned the weekly show format and resorted to "special programmes" every month or sometimes more often. In one of these, he appeared as Dr. Helmut Strasse, "argentinologist", an [[archeology|archeologist]] specialized in the lost land of Argentina, which had sunk into the Atlantic Ocean 500 years before the fictional time frame of the show. The show was a humorous [[mockumentary]] about the downfall of Argentina where Borensztein, speaking in a mixture of [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[German language|German]] and some odd words in Spanish, [[Overdubbing|overdubbed]] into straight Spanish by a narrator, commented on the latest findings and theories while he toured a digging site.

Before the broadcast of one of the programmes, federal judge María Servini de Cubría was warned that the show contained an ironic comment about a ridiculously low fine she had received for mishandling a case. Servini ordered the offending segment to be cut out, and forbade Borensztein to mention her name. This violated [[free speech]], since the programme had not been broadcast and she had not verified it was criminally offensive. Borensztein received overwhelming support from the [[art]]istic community of Argentina, but respected the judicial order, from then on referring to the judge as "the unnameable" or as ''Jueza Barubudubudía'' (intended as a nonsensical yet transparent rhyme of "Servini de Cubría") until the censorship was lifted.

==History==
[[File:Duvalier (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Papa Doc Duvalier]] created the ''Tontons Macoutes'' because he perceived the military to be a threat to his power.]]

After the [[July 1958 Haitian coup d'état attempt]] against President [[François Duvalier]], he purged the army and law enforcement agencies in Haiti and executed numerous officers as he perceived them as a threat to his regime. To counteract this threat, he created a military force that bore several names. In 1959, his paramilitary force was called the ''Cagoulards'' ("Hooded Men").&lt;ref name="Galván"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6AdAEQi2WZwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Latin American Dictators of the 20th Century: The Lives and Regimes of 15 Rulers |author=Galván, Javier A. |page=100 |year=2012 |isbn=9781476600161 |accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLQv3ZGQGqoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Social Resilience and State Fragility in Haiti |editor=Verner, Dorte |page=68 |year=2007 |isbn=9780821371886 |accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were then renamed to Milice Civile (''Civilian Militia''), and after 1962, Volontaires de la Sécurité Nationale (''Volunteers of the National Security'', or VSN).&lt;ref name="Galván"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8RNvAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Prophet and Power: Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the International Community, and Haiti |author=Dupuy, Alex |page=35 |year=2006 |isbn=9781461645368 |accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began to be called the ''Tonton Macoute'' when people started to disappear for no apparent reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I78wBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Antillanité, créolité, littérature-monde |editor=Constant, Isabelle |editor2=Mabana, Kahiudi C. |page=114 |year=2013 |isbn=9781443846325 |accessdate=9 April 2017}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group answered to him only.

Duvalier authorized the ''Tontons Macoutes'' to commit systematic violence and [[Human rights in Haiti|human rights]] abuses to suppress political opposition. They were responsible for unknown numbers of murders and [[sexual violence in Haiti|rapes in Haiti]]. Political opponents often disappeared overnight, or were sometimes attacked in broad daylight. ''Tontons Macoutes'' stoned and burned people alive. Many times they put the corpses of their victims on display, often hung in trees for everyone to see and take as warnings against opposition. Family members who tried to remove the bodies for proper burial often disappeared themselves. Anyone who challenged the VSN risked assassination. Their unrestrained [[state terrorism]] was accompanied by corruption, extortion and personal aggrandizement among the leadership. The victims of ''Tontons Macoutes'' could range from a woman in the poorest of neighborhoods who had previously supported an opposing politician to a businessman who refused to comply with extortion threats (ostensibly as donations for public works, but which were in fact the source of profit for corrupt officials and even President Duvalier). The ''Tontons Macoutes'' murdered between 30,000 and 60,000 Haitians.&lt;ref name="Henley 2010"&gt;{{cite news |last=Henley |first=Jon |date=14 January 2010 |title=Haiti: a long descent to hell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/14/haiti-history-earthquake-disaster |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715012830/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/14/haiti-history-earthquake-disaster |archive-date=15 July 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luckner Cambronne]] led the ''Tontons Macoute''  throughout the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. His cruelty earned him the nickname "Vampire of the Caribbean". This particular name was earned by one of his endeavors of extorting plasma from locals for sale.  Luckner did this through his company "Hemocaribian" and shipped five tons of plasma per month to US Labs. He would also go on to sell cadavers to medical schools after buying them from Haitian hospitals for $3 per corpse. When the Hospital could not supply this the local funeral homes would be used.&lt;ref&gt; Abbott, E. (2011). Haiti: A shattered nation.

When  [[François Duvalier]] came to power in 1957 [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] was becoming celebrated for its purely Haitian heritage by the Intellectuals, or the [[Griots]] after having been let go for years by those with education. &lt;ref&gt;Filan, Kenaz (2007).

OCLC 748396065. OL 8992653W.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tonton Macoute'' was heavily influenced by [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] tradition with denim uniforms resembling clothing like [[Azaka Medeh]] the patron of farmers and the use of the machete in symbolic reference to [[Ogou]] a great general in Vodou tradition. &lt;ref&gt; Get to know a Lwa: Kouzen Zaka.

Some of the most important members of the ''Tontons Macoute'' were [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] leaders. This religious affiliation gave the ''Tontons Macoute'' a kind of unearthly authority in the eyes of the public. From their methods to their choice of clothes, [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] always played an important role in their actions. The ''Tonton Macoutes'' wore straw hats, blue [[denim]] shirts and dark glasses, and were armed with [[machete]]s and guns. Both their allusions to the supernatural and their physical presentations were used with the intention of instilling fear and respect.&lt;ref name="Filan 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmidt |first=Bettina E. |title=The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence |series=Blackwell Companions to Religion |volume=42 |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-4443-9573-0 |page=121 |chapter=5.

The ''Tontons Macoute'' were a ubiquitous presence at the polls in the [[Haitian presidential referendum, 1961|1961 election]], in which Duvalier's official vote count was an "outrageous" and fraudulent {{nowrap|1,320,748 to 0}}, electing him to another term.&lt;ref name="Abbott 1991 "&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Elizabeth |author-link=Elizabeth Abbott |title=Haiti: The Duvaliers and Their Legacy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ql5qAAAAMAAJ |edition=Rev. and updated |date=1991 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-68620-8 |page=103 |lccn=90024770 |oclc=22767635 |ol=1680900W |orig-year=1st pub. 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appeared in force again at polls in 1964, when Duvalier held [[Haitian constitutional referendum, 1964|a rigged referendum]] that declared him [[President for Life]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Legacy==
In 1985 the United States began to shut down funds to Haitian aid cutting nearly a million dollars from it within a year. Nonetheless the regime pushed forward and even had a national party for the ''Tontons Macoute''. ''Tonton Macoute'' day was July 29, 1985 and amongst festivities the group was bestowed new uniforms and was honored by all of [[Baby Doc]]s Cabinet. In exuberance of celebration the ''Tonton Macoute'' went out into the streets and shot twenty-seven people in total for the national party. &lt;ref&gt;Haiti: A shattered nation. New York, NY: Overlook Duckworth. https://books.google.com/books?id=7JumcQAACAAJ&amp;dq=haiti+a+shattered+nation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjejte3vsLdAhVQVK0KHX_5BEkQ6wEIMDAB&lt;/ref&gt; 

The lack of funds coming to the ''Tonton Macoute'' was result of being intercepted by the [[Duvalier dynasty]] who were sometimes taking nearly eighty percent of international aid to Haiti, then turning around to only pay forty-five percent of the debts the country owed. This continued until the ''Tonton Macoute'' were left on their own when [[Baby Doc]] fled the country with an estimated $900m. &lt;ref&gt;Henley, J. (2010, January 14). Haiti: A long descent to hell. Retrieved September 15, 2018, from https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/14/haiti-history-earthquake-disaster&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tonton Macoutes'' remained active even after the presidency of "Papa Doc" Duvalier's son "Baby Doc" ended with the [[Anti-Duvalier protest movement]] 1986.&lt;ref name="Kellough 2008"/&gt; Massacres led by paramilitary groups spawned from the ''Macoutes'' continued during the following decade. The most feared paramilitary group during the 1990s was the [[Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haïti]] (FRAPH), which ''[[Toronto Star]]'' journalist Linda Diebel described as modern ''Tonton Macoutes'', and not the legitimate political party they claimed to be.&lt;ref name="COHA"/&gt; 

Led by Emmanual Constant, FRAPH differed from the ''Tonton Macoute'' in their denial to submit to the will of a single authority and their cooperation with regular military forces.&lt;ref&gt;COHA.

The fundamental concept is for the originator to signal how widely they want their [[information]] to be circulated beyond the immediate recipient.   It is designed to improve the flow of information between [[Individual|individuals]], [[Organization|organizations]] or [[Community|communities]] in a controlled and trusted way. It is important that everyone who handles TLP-labeled communications understands and obeys the rules of the protocol. Only then can trust be established and the benefits of information sharing realized. The TLP is based on the concept of the originator labeling information with one of four colors to indicate what further [[dissemination]], if any, can be undertaken by the recipient. The recipient must consult the originator if wider dissemination is required.

A number of current specifications for TLP exist:

* From US-CERT, which is intended to provide a publicly available simple definition&lt;ref name="TLP"&gt;[https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Matrix and Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;
* From the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), which published version 1.0 of its consolidated TLP document on August 31, 2016.&lt;ref name="first.org"&gt;[https://www.first.org/newsroom/releases/20160831 FIRST announces Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) version 1.0)]&lt;/ref&gt; arising from a Special Interest Group it created to ensure that interpretations of TLP are consistent, and clear expectations exist across user communities.

== Summary of TLP's four colours and their meanings==

== Types ==

Unconditional cash transfers could vary in a number of ways:&lt;ref name=mckenzie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/some-thoughts-give-directly-impact-evaluation|title = Some thoughts on the Give Directly Impact Evaluation|last = McKenzie|first = David|authorlink = David McKenzie (economist)|date = October 27, 2013|accessdate = November 28, 2015|publisher = [[World Bank]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* They could be one-off or recurring: One-off unconditional cash transfers involve either a literal one-time transfer or a transfer over a short period of time, intended to provide people money that they could use for long-term expenses. On the other hand, continuing or recurring cash transfers offer a small sum of money periodically, enabling people to save at a greater rate, or to spend more. Generally, unconditional cash transfers are more likely to be one-off than recurring. 
* They could be [[means-tested benefit|means-tested]] at the individual/household level or given to all individuals/households in a given area.
* They could be means-tested at the level of villages or applied to all villages in a given district or region.
* The grant could be made at the individual or household level, and its size could be fixed or variable based on the household size.

== Programs and organizations involved ==

=== GiveDirectly ===

{{further|GiveDirectly}}

The largest organization exclusively devoted to cash transfers is [[GiveDirectly]]. GiveDirectly was founded by economics graduate students in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], with two main inspirations: the growing evidence that cash transfers could work, and the growth of cheap and reliable money transfer technology.&lt;ref name=faye-quora&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-inspiration-to-create-GiveDirectly-Why-did-the-founders-decide-to-start-it/answer/Michael-Faye?share=1|title = What was the inspiration to create GiveDirectly? Why did the founders decide to start it?|publisher = [[Quora]]|last = Faye|first = Michael|date = October 27, 2015|accessdate = November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GiveDirectly's operations were initially limited to [[Kenya]], where the [[m-Pesa]] money transfer system is well-established. In November 2013, the organization expanded to [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name=uganda-launch&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.givedirectly.org/blog_post.php?id=4639869356775728332|title = GiveDirectly is in Uganda!|last = Mukhopadhyaya|first = Piali|date = 2013-11-20|accessdate = 2013-11-21|publisher = GiveDirectly (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charity evaluator]] [[GiveWell]] first noticed GiveDirectly in July 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2011/07/21/a-charity-to-watch-givedirectly/ |title=A charity to watch: GiveDirectly|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|publisher=GiveWell|date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; named it as a standout charity in November 2011, and gave it top charity status starting November 2012. GiveDirectly has been a GiveWell top charity in the years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly|title = GiveDirectly|accessdate = November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely as a result of GiveWell's recommendation, [[Good Ventures]], the private foundation of [[Facebook]] co-founder [[Dustin Moskovitz]] and his wife Cari Tuna, that works closely with GiveWell, has donated well over $40 million to GiveDirectly (in grant sizes of $7 million, $5 million, $25 million, and $9.8 million).&lt;ref name=good-ventures-grants&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants-database|title = Grants Database|publisher = [[Good Ventures]]|accessdate = November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An impact evaluation of GiveDirectly's cash transfer program was conducted in collaboration with GiveDirectly, with the working paper released in October 2013.&lt;ref name=shapiro-study&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/joha/www/publications/Haushofer_Shapiro_Policy_Brief_UCT_2013.10.22.pdf|title = Policy Brief: Impacts of Unconditional Cash Transfers|last = Haushofer|first = Jonathan|last2 = Shapiro|first2 = Jeremy|date = 2013-10-24|accessdate = 2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper attracted commentary from [[World Bank]] economist [[David McKenzie (economist)|David McKenzie]]. He praised the robustness of the study's design and the clear disclosure of the study lead's conflict of interest, but raised two concerns:&lt;ref name="mckenzie"/&gt;

* The use of self-reporting made the results hard to interpret and rely on (this being a feature of any study that attempted to measure consumption).
* The subdivision of the sample into so many different groups meant that there was less [[statistical power]] that could be used to clearly decide which group had better outcomes.

[[Chris Blattman]], a prominent blogger and academic in the area of development economics, with a particular focus on [[randomized controlled trial]]s, also blogged the study. He expressed two main reservations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://chrisblattman.com/2013/10/25/and-the-cashonistas-rejoice/|title = And the cashonistas rejoice|date = October 25, 2013|accessdate = November 28, 2015|last = Blattman|first = Chris|authorlink = Chris Blattman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[observer-expectancy effect]], where the people being asked questions may be subtly influenced in their answers by the experimenter's expectations.
* The lack of clear positive effect on long-term outcomes, as well as the lack of increased spending on health and education.

=== The Cash Learning Partnership ===

The Cash Learning Partnership(CaLP) is a partnership of over 150 organizations and over 5000 individuals in the humanitarian sector where they pool knowledge and expertise surrounding cash transfers and their effects.&lt;ref name=calp-about&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cashlearning.org/about-us/overview|title = About us|publisher = The Cash Learning Partnership|accessdate = November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their website includes a number of studies on unconditional cash transfers, with a particular focus on cash transfers made in the aftermath of natural disasters. Salient examples include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cashlearning.org/english/search?searchtext=unconditional+cash+transfer|title = Search for unconditional cash transfer on the Cash Learning Partnership website|accessdate = November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Electronic Cash Transfer Learning Action Network (ELAN) within CaLP has also worked with Mercy Corps, and Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG) on case studies for humanitarian electronic transfer projects in Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and Bangladesh. These case studies Examine the extent to which: 
* recipients used digital financial services (e.g. money transfers, savings, credit, purchases) through mobile money;
* the factors that affected recipients' uptake of these financial services; and
* considerations for future humanitarian programs aiming to increase the use of digital financial services among recipients. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cashlearning.org/resources/library/1014-electronic-transfers-in-humanitarian-assistance-and-uptake-of-financial-services|title =(CaLP/ELAN - Electronic transfers in humanitarian assistance and uptake of financial services|accessdate = September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cashlearning.org/downloads/electronic-transfers-in-humanitarian-assistance-and-uptake-of-financial-services.pdf|title =(REPORT) Electronic transfers in humanitarian assistance and uptake of financial services: a synthesis of ELAN case studies|accessdate = September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other programs ===

A blog post by Vishnu Prasad for the [[Institute for Financial Management and Research]] summarized existing research on unconditional cash transfers, citing studies around the following programs:&lt;ref name=ifmr-uct&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ifmr.co.in/blog/2012/12/26/unconditional-cash-transfers-what-does-research-say/|title = Unconditional Cash Transfers – What does research say?|last = Prasad|first = Vishnu|date = December 26, 2012|accessdate = November 29, 2015|publisher = [[Institute for Financial Management and Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Use as a benchmark ===

Jeremy Shapiro, a GiveDirectly co-founder and the person who published GiveDirectly's impact evaluation, has argued for using [[cash transfer]]s (and more specifically, unconditional cash transfers) as a benchmark against which other development interventions should be evaluated, due to the simplicity and scalability of cash transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/more-money-how-cash-transfers-can-transform-international-development|title = More than money: How cash transfers can transform international development|last = Shapiro|first = Jeremy|date = November 24, 2014|accessdate = November 28, 2015|publisher = [[World Bank]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who have also endorsed the idea of using cash transfers as a benchmark, citing GiveDirectly, include [[Innovations for Poverty Action]]&lt;ref name=ipa/&gt; and [[GiveWell]].&lt;ref name=gv-grant&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.givewell.org/2015/08/03/good-ventures-25-million-grant-to-givedirectly/|title = Good Ventures’ $25 million grant to GiveDirectly|last = Rosenberg|first = Josh|date = August 3, 2015|accessdate = November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media discussion ===

Since 2012, there have been a number of media pieces discussing cash transfers, generally in the context of reporting on GiveDirectly. This includes coverage in the ''[[New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/is-it-nuts-to-give-to-the-poor-without-strings-attached.html?pagewanted=all|title = Is It Nuts to Give to the Poor Without Strings Attached?|last = Goldstein|first = Jacob|date = 2013-08-13|accessdate = 2013-08-13|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21588385-giving-money-directly-poor-people-works-surprisingly-well-it-cannot-deal|title = Pennies from heaven: Giving money directly to poor people works surprisingly well.

== Evaluations of intervention impact ==


A team of the Cochrane Collaboration including researchers from Cornell University, Harvard University, and the Universities of Bremen and Otago conducted the first comprehensive systematic review of the health impact of unconditional cash transfers. The review of 21 studies, including 16 randomized controlled trials, found that unconditional cash transfers may not improve health services use. However, they lead to a large, clinically meaningful reduction in the likelihood of being sick by an estimated 27%. Unconditional cash transfers may also improve food security and dietary diversity. Children in recipient families are more likely to attend school, and the cash transfers may increase money spent on health care.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities: effect on use of health services and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |pages=CD011135 |year=2017 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Liu |first2=Sze |last3=Walter |first3=Stefan  |last4=Pabayo |first4=Roman |last5=Saith |first5=Ruhi |last6=Lhachimi |first6=Stefan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Union 55+''' (in Dutch: ''Unie 55+'') was a [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch]] pensioners' [[political party]]. The Union was somewhat successful in the 1994 elections but disappeared four years later.

==Party History==
Union 55+ was founded on 24 September 1992. During the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election campaign]] one of the governing parties, [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]] announced that it would cut [[pension|government pension]]s. This made Union 55+ very attractive to the elderly. The party won one seat. The [[General Elderly Alliance]] (Algemeen Ouderen Verbond, AOV), another party seeking to represent the elderly won six seats. The two parties had formed an [[Lijstverbinding|electoral alliance]]. The party's sole representative was Bertus Leerkes. While the six members of the AOV spent their time fighting with each other, Leerkes became a well-respected spokesperson for the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlement.com/9291000/biof/02527 Bertus Leerkes] on parlement.com "had als Kamerlid meer aanzien dan zijn collega's van het AOV." "had more respect from his fellow MPs than his colleagues of the AOV"&lt;/ref&gt; The party continually sought to cooperate with the AOV. In 1995 they formed communal lists for the 1995 provincial elections.  Before the [[Dutch general election, 1998|1998 general elections]] Union 55+ formed a new party with the AOV, the Elderly Union (Ouderenunie). They were unable to win a seat.

==Ideology &amp; Issues==
The party was a typical [[one issue party]]: it sought to better the position of the elderly with higher government pensions, better [[healthcare]] and improved facilities for elderly and handicapped. Other issues it spoke out on were increasing youth criminality, directly elected [[Burgemeester|mayor]]s and a restrictive immigration policy.

Some of the party's founders had been active within other parties such as the social-democratic [[Dutch Labour Party|PvdA]] and the socialist [[Socialistische Partij (Netherlands)|SP]], but they felt that the larger parties neglected the interests of the elderly. They thought that it was time for the formation of 'horizontal' parties, which were not based on certain ideologies, but certain age groups.

==Representation==
This table shows Union 55+'s results in elections to the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]], as well as the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter, is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party's top candidate in the general election, these posts are normally taken by the party's leader.

==Electorate==
The party was supported by elderly, especially by former CDA-voters from the Southern provinces, [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. 

==International Comparison==
The party can be compared to other [[:Category:Pensioners' parties|small elderly parties]], who often don't get a seat, but because of the [[Elections in the Netherlands|extreme proportional representation in the Netherlands]] the party was able to win one seat.

The '''United States Fish and Wildlife Service''' ('''USFWS''' or '''FWS''') is an agency of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] within the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]] dedicated to the management of [[fish]], [[wildlife]], and natural [[habitats]]. The mission of the agency is "working with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people." 

Among the responsibilities of the FWS are enforcing federal wildlife laws, protecting endangered species, managing migratory birds, restoring nationally significant fisheries, conserving and restoring wildlife habitat (such as wetlands), helping foreign governments with their international conservation efforts, and distributing money to states' fish and wildlife agencies through the [https://wsfrprograms.fws.gov/Subpages/AboutUs/AboutUs1.htm Wildlife Sport Fish and Restoration] program. 

Units within the FWS include:
* [[National Wildlife Refuge System]] (over 560 National Wildlife Refuges and thousands of small wetlands and other special management areas covering over 150 million acres (607,000&amp;nbsp;km²))
* [[Division of Migratory Bird Management]]
* [[Federal Duck Stamp]]
* [[National Fish Hatchery System]] (70 National Fish Hatcheries and 65 Fish and Wildlife Conservation Offices)
* [[Endangered Species program]] (86 Ecological Services Field Stations)
* [https://www.fws.gov/international/ International Affairs] Program
* [[National Conservation Training Center]] (Shepherdstown, WV)
* [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement|Office of Law Enforcement]]
* [[Clark R. Bavin National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory]]
* Landscape Conservation Cooperatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lccnetwork.org|title=Landscape Conservation Cooperative Network|website=www.lccnetwork.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of fish and wildlife habitat is on non-federal land. Therefore, the FWS works closely with private groups (such as Partners in Flight, Sport Fishing and Boating Partnership Council) to promote voluntary [[habitat conservation]] and restoration.

The FWS employs approximately 9,000 people and is organized into a central administrative office (in Falls Church, VA), the hallway where directorate members sit at the Department of the Interior (in Washington, DC), eight regional offices, and nearly 700 field offices distributed throughout the United States.

==History==
[[File:FWS patrol vehicles 1950.jpg|thumb|USFWS patrol vehicles, Alaska 1950]]
[[File:Sean Edwards (40680590754).png|thumb|USFWS personnel in uniform]]
The FWS originated in 1871 as the '''United States Commission on Fish and Fisheries''', more commonly referred to as the '''[[United States Fish Commission]]''', created by the [[United States Congress]] with the purpose of studying and recommending solutions to a noted decline in the [[fish stock|stocks]] of [[Fish (food)|food fish]]. [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]] was appointed its first commissioner. In 1903, the Fish Commission was reorganized as the '''United States Bureau of Fisheries'''.

In 1885–1886, the '''Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy''' (in 1885 it was the '''Section of Economic Ornithology''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/history/bsphist2.htm|title=USGS Patuxent wildlife Research Center: Biological Survey Unit History|website=www.pwrc.usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established within the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. In 1896 it became the '''Division of Biological Survey'''. Its early work focused on the effect of birds in controlling agricultural pests and mapping the geographical distribution of plants and animals in the United States. [[Clinton Hart Merriam]] headed the Bureau for 25 years and became a national figure for improving the scientific understanding of birds and mammals in the United States. [[Jay Norwood Darling]] was appointed Chief of the new Bureau of Biological Survey in 1934; the same year Congress passed the ''[[Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act]]'' (FWCA), one of the oldest federal environmental review statutes.&lt;ref name="Ros&amp;Ols-FedEnv"&gt;Rosenberg, Ronald H. and Olson, Allen H., ''Federal Environmental Review Requirements Other than NEPA: The Emerging Challenge'' (1978). CLEVELAND STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 27: 195. 1978] FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. In  [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/672 Faculty Publications. Paper 672.]   College of William and Mary Law School&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Darling's guidance, the Bureau began an ongoing legacy of protecting vital natural habitat throughout the country.  The FWS was finally created in 1940, when the Bureaus of Fisheries and Biological Survey were combined after being moved to the [[Department of the Interior]]. In 1959, the methods used by FWS's [[Animal Damage Control Program]] were featured in the [[Tom Lehrer]] song "[[Poisoning Pigeons in the Park]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Faulkner |first=Clarence |date=May 1, 1999 |title=As It Was in Region 5,1949-1964 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&amp;context=icwdmprobe |journal=The Probe |volume=200 |pages=7 |via=DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln, ''"City-wide pigeon control in Boston, MA using strychnine-treated whole corn"''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Service governs six [[U.S. National Monument|National Monuments]]:

* [[Hanford Reach National Monument]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]]; 
* [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]], a huge maritime area in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (jointly with the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and the State of [[Hawaii]]); 
* World War Two Valor in the Pacific National Monument in Alaska, Hawaii and California (jointly managed with The National Park Service); 
* [[Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument]], the largest marine protected area in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/25/presidential-proclamation-pacific-remote-islands-marine-national-monumen|title=Presidential Proclamation --- Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument Expansion|date=September 25, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in consultation with NOAA); 
* the [[Rose Atoll Marine National Monument]] in [[American Samoa]] (with NOAA and the American Samoan Government); and 
* the [[Marianas Trench Marine National Monument]], which includes undersea mud volcanoes, vents, [[chemosynthetic]] organisms, and many of the deepest points on Earth (in co-ordination of management with NOAA and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]]).

==Tribal relations==
Pursuant to the [[eagle feather law]], Title 50, Part 22 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (50 CFR 22), and the ''[[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]]'', the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service administers the [[National Eagle Repository]] and the permit system for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religious use of eagle feathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/law/eagle |title=National Eagle Repository |publisher=fws.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/permits/forms/eaglereligious.pdf |title=Eagle Parts for Native American Religious Purposes |publisher=fws.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=0d3c438b52acf3ba6b4f4e03689aacdb&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=50:6.0.1.1.5&amp;idno=50 |title=Title 50 Part 22 Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR 22)] |publisher=ecfr.gpoaccess.gov |access-date=December 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402202602/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=0d3c438b52acf3ba6b4f4e03689aacdb&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=50:6.0.1.1.5&amp;idno=50 |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These exceptions often only apply to Native Americans that are registered with the federal government and are enrolled with a federally recognized tribe.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the FWS began to incorporate the research of tribal scientists into conservation decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/nativeamerican/|title=Fish and Wildlife Service - Native American Program|last=Service|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife|website=www.fws.gov|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came on the heels of Native American [[traditional ecological knowledge]] (TEK) gaining acceptance in the scientific community as a reasonable and respectable way to gain knowledge of managing the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|date=2000|title=Rediscovery of Traditional Ecological Knowledge as Adaptive Management|url=|journal=Ecological Applications 10, No. 5 (2000): 1251-1262|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Henry|date=2000|title=Using Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Science: Methods and Applications|url=|journal=Ecological Applications 10, No. 5 (2000): 1270-1274|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, other natural resource agencies within the United States government, such as the USDA, have taken steps to be more inclusive of tribes, native people, and tribal rights.&lt;ref&gt;Banegas, Diane, "Native American Students Mentored by Forest Service Scientists," US Forest Service (blog), April 5, 2016 (1:00pm), &lt;nowiki&gt;http://blogs.usda.gov/2016/04/05/native-american-students-mentored-by-forest-service-scientists/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt; This has marked a transition to a relationship of more co-operation rather than the tension between tribes and government agencies seen historically. Today, these agencies work closely with tribal governments to ensure the best conservation decisions are made and that tribes retain their sovereignty .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=otr|title=Office of Tribal Relations {{!}} USDA|website=www.usda.gov|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/what-we-do/tribal-secretarial-order.html|title=Endangered Species Program {{!}} What We Do {{!}} Working with Tribes {{!}} Tribal Partnership Stories {{!}} American Indian Tribal Rights, Federal-Tribal Trust Responsibilities, and the Endangered Species Act|last=Program|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{!}} Endangered Species|website=www.fws.gov|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Singapore]]''' and '''[[Malaysia]]''' have a long-standing [[water conflict|conflict]] over [[water supply|water supplies]].
{{TOC right}}

==History==
===20th century===
The first water agreement was signed between [[Ibrahim of Johor|Sultan Ibrahim II]] the [[Sultan of Johor]] and the Municipal Commissioners of the Town of Singapore on 5 December 1927, under the [[Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements]]. It is no longer in force.

On 1 September 1961, the [[Federation of Malaya]] signed an agreement giving Singapore the right to draw up to {{convert|86|e6impgal|m3}} of water per day collectively from the [[Tebrau River]], the [[Skudai River]], the [[Pontian District|Pontian]] Reservoir, and the [[Mount Pulai|Gunung Pulai]] Reservoir, with effect through 2011. On 29 September 1962, a further agreement was signed providing Singapore the right to draw up to {{convert|250|e6impgal|m3}} per day from the [[Johor River]], with effect until 2061. Both agreements stipulated the price of 3 Malaysian cents per {{convert|1,000|impgal|L}}.

In 1994, Linggiu Reservoir was built upstream of the Johor River and collects and releases rainwater. This pushes seawater back into the sea, ensuring that the river water is not too salty to be treated. It is operated by the [[Public Utilities Board]] (PUB) of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;"Finding ways to increase water supply from Johor River", The Straits Times, 17 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
The Malaysian government has stated{{when|date=December 2013}} that the agreements were signed in a different time and that the price should increase. It cites the example of water sold by China to Hong Kong in the past, which was approximately US$5.8 per {{convert|1,000|impgal|L}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsd.gov.hk/filemanager/common/annual_report/2010_11/pdf/07.pdf Water Supplies Department of Hong Kong Annual Report 2010/11 - Optimising Water Supplies (3.11MB)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this price comparison is not directly applicable because while Hong Kong has borne the cost of constructing the infrastructure and China has borne the cost of maintaining to provide water to Hong Kong, Singapore paid for all the costs of the reservoirs in Johor, the dams, pipelines, plant, equipment, etc., and Singapore paid all costs of operating and maintaining the infrastructure.

On 31 August 2011, the 2011 water agreement expired, and the waterworks and facilities were handed over to the Johor state government. The handover included the Skudai and Gunung Pulai water treatment plants, which were built by the [[Public Utilities Board]] and managed by them for 50 years, as well as two pump houses in [[Pontian District|Pontian]] and [[Tebrau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_707886.html |title=1961 water agreement with Johor expires on Wednesday |publisher=[[The Straits Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922211108/http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_707886.html |archivedate=22 September 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2018, Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamed]] stated his intentions of renegotiating the agreement with Singapore as he views the low price at which water is being exported to Singapore has resulted in Malaysia losing a significant amount of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/water-malaysia-singapore-supply-deal-too-costly-renegotiate-10466390&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">The '''Win-3 Habitat''' is a small wooden structure intended for use as single person emergency shelter primarily for housing [[homeless]] individuals.  The Win-3 Habitat utilizes no internal frame-type bracing whatsoever.  Unit strength is derived from specially built [[corner pieces]] which act as load bearing structural intersections.  Win-3 Habitats are built from 1/2" grade CD [[plywood]].  Four [[acrylic glass]] windows allow adequate illumination during daylight hours and four vents provide sufficient ventilation at all other times.  Careful dimensioning of the Win-3 Habitat allows for thirty disassembled units to fit into a single high cube [[Intermodal container|shipping container]].  When not in use, the Win-3 Habitats can be disassembled and returned to the container.  Assembly and disassembly time utilizing two workers is fifteen minutes per unit.  Win-3 Habitats can easily be cleaned and sanitized between each use and have an indefinite storage life.  

The Win-3 Habitat was designed by [[naval architect]] [[Vernon Koenig]] and is manufactured by [[Stratodyne, Inc]]., located in [[Yucaipa, California]].  In addition to the Win-3 Habitat, Stratodyne also manufactures emergency disaster shelters and low cost kit-built homes for third world countries.

The '''Wings for Life World Run''' is a [[running|running competition]] held on the first weekend of May since [[2014 in athletics (track and field)|2014]] to collect funds for the not-for-profit [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] ''Wings for Life''. The entry fee goes completely to the foundation.

The Wings for Life World Run is peculiar in that participants don't have to run a specific distance like in comparable competitions. A car rides on the track half an hour after the start. Overtaken participants are eliminated until just one, the winner, remains. The run also takes place in 34 or 35 locations around the world at the same time and is broadcast live on [[Red Bull TV]].

== The Wings for Life Foundation and the Wings for Life World Run ==
The not-for-profit foundation ''Wings for Life'' was established by the two-time motocross world champion [[Heinz Kinigadner]] and the [[Red Bull]] founder [[Dietrich Mateschitz]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/s/sport/sommersport/leichtathletik/4722904/CharityLauf_Ketema-wieder-Wings-for-Life-World-RunSieger|title=Charity-Lauf – Ketema wieder "Wings for Life World Run"-Sieger|last=KG|first=Kleine Zeitung GmbH &amp; Co|website=Kleine Zeitung|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal is to find a treatment for [[spinal cord injuries]] and [[paraplegia]]. Therefore, the foundation supports research and studies about spinal cord and spinal cord injuries financially. Anita Gerhardter is CEO. Founder Kinigadner himself is concerned because his brother and his son, both motocross riders too, are bounded to wheelchairs after injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=de|first=Julia|last=Schweinberger|title=Motocross: Weltmeister Kinigadner über Schicksalsschläge|url=http://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/ernaehrung/motocross-weltmeister-kinigadner-ueber-schicksalsschlaege-a-1031571.html|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years of preparations the first Wings for Life World Run was started on May 4, 2014 to raise funds and at the same time arouse attention on limitations and medical problems of paraplegic persons. Following the success of the first edition the race is now an annual event. According to the official Website the idea to organize a worldwide race where the last man standing would be the winner, came during a lay-over at the airport in Moscow.

The race is open to everybody, professionals as well as members or non-members of running clubs. The entry fee is donated entirely to the foundation, the main sponsor Red Bull covers the costs of the event. The fees vary somewhat depending on the choice of location and the time of sign up. 40.00 GBP are due to take part in Great Britain, 50.00 USD to take part in the United States, but it is also possible to augment the donation during the registration process. So far 3 million and 4.2 million euro of donation have been collected in the two first editions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Motto of the race is:

:"Running for those who can’t."

=== "World" Run ===
The name Wings for Life ''World'' Run comes from the fact that the race takes place in 34 or 35 different locations around the Earth at the same time. That means that runners in [[Europe]] or [[Africa]] run around noon while participants in [[Asia]] and [[Australia]] in the afternoon or evening. In the [[Americas]] the race is early in the morning or even during the night.

=== The "Catcher Car" ===
The Wings for Life World Run is outstanding because there is no prescribed distance to cover for example 10 kilometers or 42.195&amp;nbsp;km like in a [[marathon]]. Thus runners of very different levels can equally take part.

100&amp;nbsp;km are prepared at each location. All participants start at the same time, a so-called "Catcher Car" rides on the track 30 minutes after the start. The speed is 15&amp;nbsp;km/h at first and increases step by step. Once a runner is overtaken by the car, the race is finished for them. Busses bring eliminated participants back to the start area. Thus what counts on the sport side is not the time needed to cover a given distance but the distance covered before the Catcher Car overtakes one.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-EN|title=Rulebook – Wings for Life World Run 2015|url=http://www.wingsforlifeworldrun.com/uploads/files/wingsforlifeworldrun_rules_inshort2015.pdf|website=www.wingsforlifeworldrun.com|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last remaining female and male runners at each locations are the ''local'' Wings for Life World Run winners and gain the right to start the following year at a location of their choice. The woman and man that ran the longest distance worldwide are the ''Wings for Life World Run Global Champions'' and are rewarded with a trip around the world as special prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Run Sieger auf Weltreise bei ServusTV|url=http://www.servustv.com/at/Medien/Wings-for-Life-World-Run3/Wings-for-Life-World-Run-Weltreise|website=www.servustv.com|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions and tracks vary quite a lot. The Catcher Cars are steered precisely using global satellite navigation hence a comparison between the different locations is nonetheless possible. The following table show how fast the car rides at what time after the start and how far it is at each speed change.

== Wings for Life World Run 2014 ==
The first Wings for Life World Run took place on '''May 4, 2014''' in 34 locations around the Earth. The start was given at 10:00 [[UTC]] everywhere. The British track and field world champion [[Colin Jackson]] was race director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr-FR|title=Courir pour ceux qui ne peuvent pas|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Athletisme/Actualites/Courir-pour-ceux-qui-ne-peuvent-pas/452340|website=L'Equipe.fr|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition became a success. Especially the men's race for the global title was very close. In the end Lemawork Ketema from Ethiopia won with 78.58&amp;nbsp;km he ran in Austria. That distance was just 90 m more than the Peruvian Remigio Huaman Quispe who ran in Lima and 180 m more than [[Evgenii Glyva]] from Ukraine who ran in Austria together with Ketema.

Elise Selvikvåg Molvik from Norway covered 54.79&amp;nbsp;km in Stavanger to claim the women's global championship. It is worth mentioning that, according to the official website, she was just 18 years old at that time and had never run more than 30&amp;nbsp;km in competition. 54.79&amp;nbsp;km meant also the 42nd place in the combined male and female ranking. Nathalie Vasseur from France became second with 51.26&amp;nbsp;km in Hennebont, the Moldovian Svetlana Shepeleva became third with 48.29&amp;nbsp;km in Alanya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en-EN|title=Ethiopian wins first-ever World Run|url=http://www.wingsforlife.com/en/latest/ethiopian-wins-first-ever-world-run-812/|website=www.wingsforlife.com|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All in all 35397 men and women, among them several celebrities like [[Mark Webber]] and [[Aksel Lund Svindal]], took part and ran 530928&amp;nbsp;km together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en-EN|last1=Sturtridge|first1=Tim|title=Wings for Life World Run: The results are in|url=http://www.redbull.com/en/stories/1331649263143/wings-for-life-world-run-the-results-are-in|website=www.redbull.com|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wings for Life World Run 2015 ==
The second edition of the Wings for Life World Run was held on '''May 3, 2015''' in 35 locations. This year the start was given at 11:00 UTC. The race director was as in the year before the British track and field world champion Colin Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr-FR|title=Wings for Life World Run, la course événement de retour le 3 mai|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Athletisme/Actualites/Wings-for-life-world-run-la-course-evenement-de-retour-le-3-mai/543814|website=L'Equipe.fr|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This year 72,224 women and men, among them again numerous internationally known sportsmen like [[Marcel Hirscher]] and [[Gregor Schlierenzauer]], started. Aksel Lund Svindal, who ran in 2014, drove the Catcher Car in Stavanger this time. Like him some other celibrities did the same for example [[Felix Baumgartner]] (in Bucharest) and [[David Coulthard]] (in Silverstone).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Concerning the sport side, the two best of the preceding edition Lemawork Ketema and Remigio Huaman Quispe ran at the same location in Austria. Ketema improved his performance up to 79.90&amp;nbsp;km and remained global champion. Quispe ran nearly as far as in 2014, namely 78.20&amp;nbsp;km, for a third place worldwide. The race developed again to a duel over distance, this time with the Chilian César Díaz Hernández, who became second with 78.31&amp;nbsp;km in Santiago, and with Giorgio Calcaterra who repeated his win in Italy and improved quite a lot up to 78.06&amp;nbsp;km (4th global rank).

Elise Molvik, global champion in 2014, ran again in Stavanger. She claimed the local title but 45.02&amp;nbsp;km were far from the worldwide best women. The podium was Yuuko Watanabe from Japan (56.33&amp;nbsp;km in Takashima), Riana van Niekerk from South Africa with 55.21&amp;nbsp;km in Cape Town and Nathalie Vasseur (second in 2014) with 52.18&amp;nbsp;km in Sunrise this year.

== Wings for Life World Run 2016 ==
On '''May 8, 2016''' 11:00 UTC the Wings for Life World Run had his third edition. As in 2014 there were 34 locations, among them two in the USA. Colin Jackson was again the race director. The Catcher Cars were driven by international stars like in the years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/F1-legend-David-Coulthard-Cambridge-leg-Wings/story-28861187-detail/story.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329140414/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/F1-legend-David-Coulthard-Cambridge-leg-Wings/story-28861187-detail/story.html# |archive-date=2016-03-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/2000036526817/Wings-for-Life-World-Run-Italiener-Calcaterra-lief-88-44 "Wings for Life Run": Calcaterra lief 88,44 Kilometer] (May 8, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

130,732 runners took part worldwide and covered more than 1.2 million kilometers. In addition there were 20,556 so-called "Selfie Runners", that is people not running at one of the 34 locations and simulating the catcher cars with an app on their mobile phones. The foundation collected 6.6 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en-EN|title=After 34 Simultaneous Races Across 12 Time Zones, Wings For Life World Run Crowns 2016 Champions|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/after-34-simultaneous-races-across-12-time-zones-wings-for-life-world-run-crowns-2016-champions-300264800.html#continue-jump|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=de-DE|title=Wings for Life World Run weltweit 2016 mit 130.732 Teilnehmern|url=http://www.bunert.de/blog/wings-for-life-world-run-weltweit-2016-mit-130.732-teilnehmern|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian ultrarunner [[Giorgio Calcaterra]] won for the third time in Italy and took the global title this time too. He improved the record a lot with 88.44&amp;nbsp;km which meant that for the first time the Catcher Car had to accelerate to the top speed of 35&amp;nbsp;km/h to overtake him. The worldwide podium was completed by Bartosz Olszewski from Poland, who also ran over 80&amp;nbsp;km in Canada, and the Chilean Francisco Morales. Lemawork Ketema, global champion in 2014 and 2015, ran again in Austria. For a long time he was side by side with [[Evgenii Glyva]] like in 2014. However Ketema decided to stop after 41&amp;nbsp;km not to compromise his form in view of other races.

A lot of top performances were set in Takashima in Japan. That was also the location for the global champion in the female race like in 2015. Kaori Yoshida set a new record with 65.71&amp;nbsp;km, an improvement of 9.38&amp;nbsp;km and an 18th place in the combined men and women classification. The following places went to the Austrian Karin Freitag with 59.08&amp;nbsp;km in Munich and to Vera Nunes from Portugal with 58.86&amp;nbsp;km. Last year's winner Yuuko Watanabe covered nearly exactly the same distance as in 2015 with 56.37&amp;nbsp;km, the global fifth place.
