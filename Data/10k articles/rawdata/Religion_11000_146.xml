The '''Sh≈´yu√†n''' ({{zh|t=Êõ∏Èô¢|s=‰π¶Èô¢|p=sh≈´yu√†n}}), usually known in English as '''Academies''' or '''Academies of Classical Learning''', were a type of school in ancient [[China]]. Unlike national academy and district schools, ''shuyuan'' were usually private establishments built away from cities or towns, providing a quiet environment where scholars could engage in studies and contemplation without restrictions and worldly distractions.

==History==
{{Main|Taixue|Ancient higher-learning institutions}}
The ''shuyuan'' originated in 725 during the [[Tang dynasty]]. They were places where scholars could teach and study the classics, and where books collected from around the country could be preserved. By the late Tang dynasty, private academies had appeared all over China.

During the [[Song dynasty#Northern Song, 959‚Äì1126|Northern Song (960-1126)]], many academies were established with government encouragement. Each academy had its own teaching and administrative structure and was economically independent.

The bestowal of a calligraphic signboard by the emperor was an extremely important symbol of an academy's status during the Northern Song period. The following academies received this honour:

*997: [[Taishi Academy]] (Songyang Academy), bestowed by the [[Emperor Taizong of Song]]
*1009: [[Yingtianfu Academy]], bestowed by the [[Emperor Zhenzong]]
*1015: [[Yuelu Academy]], bestowed by Emperor Zhenzong
*1035: [[Shigu Academy]], bestowed by [[Emperor Renzong of Song]]

Besides signboards, emperors also bestowed books. In 977, the Taizong Emperor bestowed on the [[White Deer Grotto Academy]] a copy of the Nine [[Chinese classics]] printed by the [[Guozijian]]. The Yuelu Academy, the Songyang Academy and other academies also received books from the Emperor on a number of occasions.

However, academies had begun to decline by the twelfth century. The White Deer Grotto Academy, which had fallen into ruin, was rebuilt by the prominent neo-Confucianist [[Zhu Xi]] in 1179-80 during the [[Song dynasty#Southern Song, 1127‚Äì1279|Southern Song (1127‚Äì1279)]] and reopened in 1180. It became an important centre of Confucian thought during eight centuries. [[Zhu Xi]] himself taught here during the Southern Song as did [[Wang Yangming]] during the Ming. As a result of Zhu Xi's efforts, the ''shuyuan'' became a permanent feature of Chinese education, taking up major responsibilities of local education.

The system of academies was dismantled under the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271-1368) and all academies were placed under government control to become preparatory schools for the [[imperial examination]]s. However, the system was revived under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368-1644) and the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (1644-1911).

In the Ming dynasty, academies devoted to discussing political issues appeared, such as the [[Donglin Academy]], often resulting in political repression. According to one study, 40% of the 1239 known Ming academies were built during the [[Jiajing Emperor|Jiajing era]] (1522-1566).&lt;ref&gt;Education in Traditional China: A History, Thomas H. C. Lee, p. 100. {{ISBN|90-04-10363-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Qing, thousands of academies were created for the purpose of preparing students for the Imperial Examination, although there were still some that functioned as centres of study and research.

The academies were finally abolished under the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] in 1898 at the end of the Qing dynasty.

There were more than 7,000 academies recorded. In the late Qing dynasty, some became universities, middle schools, public libraries and museums.

In Korea, which also adopted Confucianism, the ''shuyuan'' were known as [[Seowon]].

==Shuyuan as a modern term==
In the late Qing dynasty, schools teaching Western science and technology were established. Many such schools were called ''Shuyuan'' in Chinese. Despite the common name, these ''shuyuan'' are quite modern in concept and are quite different from traditional academies of classical learning.

==Notable academies==
In discussing the ''shuyuan'', it is common to speak of the "Four Great Academies" (ÂõõÂ§ß‰π¶Èô¢; ''s√¨-d√† sh≈´-yu√†n'') of ancient China. Usually the "Four Great Academies" refers to the Four Great Academies of the Northern Song. However, sources give a number of different lists, sometimes expanded to Six or Eight Great Academies. Only one, the [[Yuelu Academy]], appears in all lists. Each school went up or down the list in different periods. [[White Deer Grotto Academy]] had long been important. As for the impact on the politics of China, [[Donglin Academy]] in the [[Ming Dynasty]] is especially notable.

===The Four Great Academies===
Also known as the Four Great Academies of the Northern Song or the Four Northern Song Academies.
*Songyang Academy
*Yingtianfu Academy
*[[Yuelu Academy]]
*[[White Deer Grotto Academy]]

Sometimes the Shigu Academy is substituted for the Songyang Academy.

===The Four Great Academies of the Early Song===
*Shigu Academy
*Jinshan Academy
*[[Yuelu Academy]]
*[[Culai Academy]]

===The Four Great Academies of the Southern Song===
*Lize Academy
*Xiangshan Academy
*Yuelu Academy
*[[White Deer Grotto Academy]]

===The Six Great Academies===
*Songyang Academy
*Yingtianfu Academy
*Yuelu Academy
*White Deer Grotto Academy
*Shigu Academy
*Maoshan Academy

(An alternative list of "Six Great Academies of the Northern Song" contains the same academies in a different order.)

===The Eight Great Academies of the Northern Song===
*Shigu Academy
*Yingtianfu Academy
*Yuelu Academy
*White Deer Grotto Academy
*Songyang Academy
*Maoshan Academy
*Longmen Academy
*Culai Academy

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6301">'''Anƒ´r√¢n''' ([[Modern Persian]], {{lang|fa|ÿßŸÜ€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ}}) or '''AnƒìrƒÅn''' ([[Middle Persian]], {{lang|pal|ê≠†ê≠≠ê≠©ê≠•ê≠†ê≠≠}}) is an ethno-linguistic term that signifies "non-[[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]" or "non-[[Greater Iran|Iran]]" (non-Aryan). Thus, in a general sense, 'Aniran' signifies lands where [[Iranian languages]] are not spoken. In a pejorative sense, it denotes "a political and religious enemy of Iran and [[Zoroastrianism]]."&lt;ref name="Gignoux_Aneran"&gt;{{iranica|aneran|AnƒìrƒÅn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'Aniran' derives from [[Middle Persian]] ''anƒìrƒÅn'', [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] '' ºnyr ºn'',  an antonym of ''[[Iran (word)|ƒìrƒÅn]]'' that in turn denoted either the people or the [[Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref name="MacKenzie"&gt;{{iranica|eran-eransah|ƒírƒÅn, ƒírƒÅn≈°ahr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "in Zoroastrian literature and possibly in Sasanian&lt;!-- do not change. In a quotation --&gt; political thought as well, the term has also a markedly religious connotation. An ''anƒìr'' person is not merely non-Iranian, but specifically non-Zoroastrian; and ''anƒìr'' designates also worshipers of the [[daeva|''dƒìws'']] ("demons") or adherents of other religions." In these texts of the ninth to twelfth century, "Arabs and Turks are called ''anƒìr'', as are Muslims generally, the latter in a veiled manner."&lt;ref name="Gignoux_Aneran" /&gt;

==In inscriptions==
In official usage, the term is first attested in inscriptions of [[Shapur I]] (r. 241‚Äì272), who styled himself the "king of kings of ''ƒírƒÅn'' and ''AnƒìrƒÅn''." Shapur's claim to ''AnƒìrƒÅn'' reflected the emperor's victories over [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and [[Philip the Arab|Philip]], and staked a claim against the [[Roman Empire]], the enemies of the Sassanid state. This is also reflected in [[Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]], where the emperor includes [[Syria]], [[Cappadocia]], and [[Cilicia]] - all three previously captured from the Romans&amp;nbsp;‚Äî in his list of ''AnƒìrƒÅn'' territories.&lt;ref name="Gignoux_Aneran" /&gt; 

The proclamation as "king of kings of ƒírƒÅn and AnƒìrƒÅn" remained a stock epithet of subsequent Sassanid dynasts. Thirty years after Shapur, the Zoroastrian high-priest [[Kartir]] included the [[Caucasus]] and [[Armenia]] in his list of ''AnƒìrƒÅn'' territories. In this, Kartir's inscription (also at [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]]) contradicts Shapur's, which included the same two regions in his list of regions of ''ƒírƒÅn''.&lt;ref name="Gignoux_Aneran" /&gt;

==In scripture and folklore==
Although first attested in a Sassanid-era proclamation, ''AnƒìrƒÅn'', like ''ƒírƒÅn'', is conceptually several centuries older, appearing in the ''[[Younger Avesta]]'' as ''anairya'', where it denotes the "[[Turan]]ians" (the identification of the Turan/AnƒìrƒÅn with a particular place is a historically distinct development, see above and below). These "Turanians" of AnƒìrƒÅn, apparently the traditional enemies of the [[Avestan]]-speaking peoples, appear in Zoroastrian cosmogony and cosmology as the noxious folk of the sixteen lands created by [[Angra Mainyu]] (''Vendidad'' 1.18). These lands lay beyond [[Anahita#As a cosmological entity|the world river]] that encircled the sixteen lands created by [[Ahura Mazda]], the first of which was [[Airyanem Vaejah|''Airyan…ôm Vaƒìjah'']], meaning "expanse of the [[Iranian peoples]]". This same term in [[Middle Persian]] was ''ƒírƒÅn (vƒìj)''.

In the ninth to twelfth century Zoroastrian texts, the legendary Turanian king and military commander [[Afrasiab]] is (together with [[Zahhak|Dahag]] and [[Alexander the Great]]) the most hated among the beings that Ahriman (Avestan ''Angra Mainyu'') set against the Iranians (''[[Zand-i Wahman yasn]]'' 7.32; ''Menog-i Khrad'' 8.29)&lt;ref name="Yarshater"&gt;{{iranica|afrasiab-turanian-king|AfrƒÅsƒ´ƒÅb}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the poet [[Ferdowsi]] draws on Zoroastrian scripture (with due attribution) and retains the association of ''Aneran'' with the Turanians. The poet, however, specifically places them beyond the [[Amu Darya]] and identifies the Turanians as "[[Oghuz Turks|Turks]]". From the point of view of Ferdowsi's home in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], this identification coincides with the Avestan notion (e.g. ''[[Vendidad]]'' 7.2, 19.1) that the lands of Angra Mainyu (Middle Persian: Ahriman) lay to the north. The two sources do however diverge with respect to details. In the Avesta, [[Sogdia]] (Avestan ''Sughdha'', present-day [[Sughd Region|Sughd]] and [[Samarqand Region]]s) is not AnƒìrƒÅn&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Sogdia is one of the sixteen lands created by Mazda, not one of the lands of Angra Mainyu.

Nonetheless, for Ferdowsi the division between ƒírƒÅn and AnƒìrƒÅn is just as rigid as it is in the ''Avesta'': When the primordial king [[Fereydun]] (Avestan ''Œòraƒìtaona'') divides his kingdom&amp;nbsp;‚Äì the whole world&amp;nbsp;‚Äì among his three sons, he gives the Semitic lands in the west to the eldest, the lands of the north to his middle son Tur (Avestan ''Turya'', hence the name "Turanian"), and ''ƒírƒÅn'' to his youngest (''Shahnameh'' 1.189&lt;ref name="Dhalla"&gt;{{citation|last=Dhalla|first=Maneckji N.|year=1922|title=Zoroastrian Civilization|location=New York|publisher=OUP|pages=5-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the story, this partition leads to a family feud in which an alliance of the two elder sons (who rule over the AnƒìrƒÅnian lands) battle the forces of the youngest (the Iranians). The Iranians win.

For Ferdowsi, the Turanians/AnƒìrƒÅnians (often used interchangeably) are unquestionably the villains of peace. Their conflict with Iranians is the main theme of the ''Shahnameh'' and accounts for more than half of the text.&lt;ref name="Yarshater" /&gt; The deaths of heroes and other admirable figures are frequently attributed to Turanians. Thus ''Shahnameh'' 5.92&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{citation|last=Williams Jackson|first=A.V.|year=1899|title=Zoroaster, the prophet of ancient Iran|location=New York|publisher=Columbia UP|pages=130-131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; says a Turanian raider named Tur-Baratur killed the 77-year-old [[Zoroaster]] in [[Balkh]].

{{nihongo|'''Arahitogami'''|Áèæ‰∫∫Á•û}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word meaning a ''[[kami]]'' (or "deity") who is a human being. It first appears in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' ({{circa|720}}) as a words of [[Yamato Takeru]] saying "I am a son of Arahitokami".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, at the request of the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|GHQ]], the [[Sh≈çwa Emperor]]&lt;!-- DO NOT remove the term 'Sh≈çwa Emperor' as deceased emperors are properly referred to by their era names. --&gt; (Hirohito) proclaimed in the [[Humanity Declaration]] that he had never been an {{nihongo|''akitsumikami''|ÁèæÂæ°Á•û|}}, divinity in human form, and claimed his relation to the people did not rely on such a [[mythological]] idea but on a historically developed family-like reliance.

Dar al-Diya'.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Founder===
[[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash øari]] was noted for his teachings on [[atomism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/hmp/14.htm Ash'ari - A History of Muslim Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; among the earliest [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophies]], and for al-Ash øari this was the basis for propagating the view that [[God in Islam|God]] created every moment in [[time]] and every particle of [[matter]]. He nonetheless believed in [[free will]], elaborating the thoughts of [[Dirar ibn 'Amr]] and [[Abu Hanifa]] into a "dual agent" or "acquisition" (''[[iktisab]]'') account of free will.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Montgomery. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

While al-Ash øari opposed the views of the [[Mu'tazili]] school for its over-emphasis on reason, he was also opposed to the view which [[Bi-la kaifa|rejected all debate]], held by certain schools such as the [[Zahiri]] ("literalist"), [[Mujassimite]] ("[[Anthropotheism|anthropotheist]]") and [[Muhaddith]]in ("[[tradition]]alist") schools for their over-emphasis on [[taqlid]] (imitation) in his ''Istihsan al‚ÄëKhaud'':&lt;ref&gt;M. Abdul Hye, Ph.D, [http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/hmp/14.htm Ash‚Äôarism], ''Philosophia Islamica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"A section of the people (i.e., the Zahirites and others) made capital out of their own ignorance; [[Debate|discussions]] and [[Rationality|rational thinking]] about matters of faith became a heavy burden for them, and, therefore, they became inclined to blind faith and blind following (taqlid). They condemned those who tried to rationalize the principles of religion as '[[Bid‚Äòah|innovators]].' They considered discussion about [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[Rest (physics)|rest]], [[Physical body|body]], [[accident]], [[Color|colour]], [[space]], [[atom]], the leaping of atoms, and Attributes of [[God]], to be an innovation and a [[sin]]. They said that had such discussions been the right thing, the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] and his [[Sahaba|Companions]] would have definitely done so; they further pointed out that the Prophet, before his death, discussed and fully explained all those matters which were necessary from the religious point of view, leaving none of them to be discussed by his followers; and since he did not discuss the problems mentioned above, it was evident that to discuss them must be regarded as an innovation."}}

===Development===
Ash øarism became the main school of [[early Islamic philosophy]] whereby it was originally based on the foundations laid down by [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash øari]] who founded the school in the 10th century based on the methodology taught to him by his teacher [[Abdullah ibn Sa'eed ibn Kullaab]]. However, the school underwent many changes throughout history resulting in the term Ash øari, in modern usage, being extremely broad, e.g. differences between Ibn Fawrak  (d. AH 406) and  al-Bayhaqi (d. AH 384).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnah.org/history/Scholars/imam_bayhaqi.htm|title=Imam Bayhaqi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shafiifiqh.com/imam-abu-bakr-al-bayhaqi/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216162405/http://www.shafiifiqh.com/imam-abu-bakr-al-bayhaqi/ |archivedate=2013-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the Asharite view was that comprehension of the unique nature and characteristics of [[God]] were beyond human capability. The solution proposed by [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash øari]] to solve the problems of tashbih and ta'til concedes that the Divine Being possesses in a real sense the attributes and Names mentioned in the Quran. Insofar as these names and attributes have a positive reality, they are distinct from the essence, but nevertheless they do not have either existence or reality apart from it. The inspiration of al-Ash øari in this matter was on the one hand to distinguish essence and attribute as concepts, and on the other hand to see that the duality between essence and attribute should be situated not on the quantitative but on the qualitative level ‚Äî something which Mu'tazili thinking had failed to grasp.&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), pp. 115 and 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ash øarite view holds that:

==Criticism==
[[Ibn Taymiyyah]] attacked Ashari thought as (in the words of one historian, Jonathan A.C.Brown) "a Greek solution to Greek problems" that should "never" have concerned Muslims.&lt;ref name=brown-62&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Brown|first1 = Jonathan A.C.|authorlink=Jonathan A.C.

On the other hand, German [[oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Eduard Sachau]] blamed the theology of Ash øari and its biggest defender, [[al-Ghazali]], specifically for the decline of Islamic science starting in the tenth century, and stated that the two clerics were the only obstacle to the Muslim world becoming a nation of "[[Galileo Galilei|Galileos]], [[Johannes Kepler|Keplers]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newtons]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Muzaffar Iqbal]], ''Science and Islam'', pg. 120. From the Greenwood Guides to Science and Religion Series. [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]]: [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 2007. {{ISBN|9780313335761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, however, argue that the Ash øarites not only accepted scientific methods but even promoted them. [[Ziauddin Sardar]] points out that some of the greatest [[Science in medieval Islam|Muslim scientists]], such as [[Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´]], who were pioneers of the [[scientific method]], were themselves followers of the Ash øari school of Islamic theology.&lt;ref name=Sardar&gt;{{Citation|last=Sardar|first=Ziauddin|author-link=Ziauddin Sardar|year=1998 |contribution=Science in Islamic philosophy |title=Islamic Philosophy |publisher=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H016.htm |accessdate=2008-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Ash øarites who believed that faith or ''taqlid'' should apply only to Islam and not to any ancient [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] authorities,&lt;ref name=Anwar&gt;{{citation|last=Anwar|first=Sabieh|date=October 2008|title=Is GhazƒÅlƒ´ really the Halagu of Science in Islam?|journal=[[Al-Mawrid|Monthly Renaissance]]|volume=18|issue=10|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=1016|accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn al-Haytham's view that ''taqlid'' should apply only to [[prophets of Islam]] and not to any other authorities formed the basis for much of his [[scientific skepticism]] and criticism against [[Ptolemy]] and other ancient authorities in his ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' and ''[[Book of Optics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rashed|first=Roshdi|year=2007|title=The Celestial Kinematics of Ibn al-Haytham|journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy|volume=17|pages=7‚Äì55 [11]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |issue=01 |doi=10.1017/S0957423907000355 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have questioned the spiritual value of discussion methods employed by the Ash øarites and other dialectical theologians. [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], himself a leading figure of the Ash øari school, said at the end of his life: "I employed all the methods which philosophy and dialectic had provided, but in the end I realised that these methods neither could bring solace to the weary heart nor quench the thirst of the thirsty. The best method and the nearest one to reality was the method provided by the Qur'an."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Ahmad Jullundhry, Quranic Exegesis in Classical Literature, pg. 53-54. Islamic Book Trust/The Other Press, 2010. {{ISBN|9789675062551}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source}}

==Description==
According to the mythology, he is a [[moon god]], and he has been living in sixth floor of the [[sky]] with [[Gun Ana]] ({{lang-tr|G√ºn Ana}}), the [[sun goddess]], who he is coupled with. While G√ºn Ana is symbol of warmness and hotness, Ay Dede is the symbol of cold.

In [[Turkey]], he is well known in modern times, Ay Dede is popular amongst children due to [[Fairy tale|tale]]s being told about him. The mythology is more common amongst [[Central Asian]] [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], such as [[Altaians]] and [[Yakuts]], who still have populations who actively practice [[Tengrism]].

Notably, in the ''[[Epic poetry|Epic]] of [[Oghuz Khan]]'', Ay Tanrƒ± also is mentioned as the father of [[Oghuz Khan]], even though that part remains somewhat unclear. It's also notable Oghuz Khan's second son was named [[Ayhan]] (Ay Khan, "moon khan").

==Aisar==
From ancient times, the Turkic people believed that humans had secret lunar powers ('''Aisar''' or '''Aysar'''). Female pregnancy lasts about nine lunar months, and women often deliver during a full moon. The three phases of the moon were also symbolic. It was believed that at "Ai Naazy" (new moon) the moon symbolised a growing young child, who is pure and modest. At "Ai Toly" (full moon), the moon personified a mature good-natured mother or father. At "Ai Karty" (old moon) the moon aged, became wise. But at the same time quarrelsome and malicious. Before its death, the moon reigned over a totally dark night. The forces of life and death met during these nights. After the meeting they separated, only to meet again after a defined period. When the old moon died, a new one was born and so on, ad infinitum.  The Turkic people trusted the magic influence of the Moon. She was their sole "night lantern". The celebrations of malicious spirits occurred mostly at night. The rituals and trances of witches and demons were always timed according to the phases of the Moon. In Turkish culture At night, illnesses got worse and caused more deaths. To please the Moon God, those born during a full moon were given names as such: Aisylu (Aysulu), Aituly (Aytulu), Ainir (Aynur), Aizirek (Ayzerek) and Ainaz (Aynaz).

Those who carry the title are [[expert]]s in [[Islamic studies]] such as [[jurisprudence]], [[Quran reading]], and [[philosophy]] and usually teach in [[Hawza|Islamic seminaries]]. The next lower clerical rank is [[Hojatoleslam|Hujjat al-Islam.]]

==History==
The name "ayatullah" originates from a passage in [[the Quran]] which the [[Shi'a]], unlike the [[Sunni]], interpret to mean human beings can be regarded as 'signs' or 'evidence' of God. Passage 51:20‚Äì21 of the Quran states:

{{quote|On the earth are signs ([[Ayat]]) for those of assured Faith,&lt;br /&gt;
As also in your own selves: Will ye not then see?}}

[[File:Ruhollah Khomeini speaking to his followers against capitulation day 1964.jpg|thumb|Grand Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] in [[Qom]], 1964]]

The term was not commonly used as a title until the early twentieth century. The title of Ayatollah became popularized with the creation of [[Qom Seminary]] in 1922.

The title is currently granted to top Shia  ''[[mujtahid]]'', after completing ''sat'h'' and ''kharij'' studies in the ''[[hawza]]''. By then the ''mujtahid'' would be able to issue his own edicts from the sources of Islamic religious laws: the [[Qur'an]], the ''[[Sunnah]]'', ''[[Ijma|ijmƒÅ ª]]'', and ''[['aql]]''  ("intellect", rather than the Sunnƒ´ principle of ''[[qiyas]]''). Most of the time this is attested by an issued certificate from his teachers. The ayatollah can then teach in ''hawzas (shia seminaries)'' according to his speciality, can act as a reference for their religious questions, and act as a judge.

==Female Mujtahids==
There are a few women who are equal in ranking to the ayatollahs but are not ayatollahs, and are known as ''Lady [[Ijtihad#Qualifications of a Shi'a mujtahid|Mujtahideh]]''. A Mujtahid cannot have a congregation.  The most outstanding in recent history was [[Lady Amin|Nosrat Amin]], also known as Banu Isfahani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

Historically, there have been several Mujtahidehs in [[Shia|Shi'ism]], most famously the women in the family of [[Allama Hilli]], as well as the [[Baraghani]] family of 19th-century Qazvin.

Only a few of the most important ayatollahs are accorded the rank of Grand Ayatollah (''Ayatollah Uzma'', "Great Sign of God"). When an ayatollah gains a significant following and they are recognized for religiously correct views, they are considered a ''Marja'-e-Taqlid'', which in common parlence is "grand ayatollah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Baaloul''' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ÿ®ÿπŸÑŸàŸÑ, [[transliteration|. Tr]] '' B'al≈´l '') is a town located in the eastern [[Bekaa Valley]] of southeastern [[Lebanon]].

Baaloul is located in a remote area in the middle of mountainous areas. It limits the east with the people of [[Lela, Lebanon|Lela]] and west to the village of [[Karaoum]]. Its current population is approximately 200 native people from the village, considering that many residents living abroad. Its inhabitants are religionists [[Muslim]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], but also resides a family [[Christian]] [[Christian|Maronite]] in the community.

This town is known for being one of the many born of emigration from [[Lebanon]]. The first wave of migration that emerged in Baaloul was between 1935 - 1950, prior to Lebanese independence and during administration of the territory by [[France]]. The [[French Mandate of Lebanon]] exercised authority and take political and economic decisions in the territory. The [[France|French]] showed certain preferences to the community [[Christian]] [[Christian|Maronite]], some discrimination to be reported to the [[Muslim]]. Lebanese Muslim men of the time were protesting the situation and claimed that they did not want to live in a country where decisions were exercised by foreigners over the [[Arab]], this resulted in the displacement of these out of Lebanese territory.

The second displacement of its inhabitants began during the 70s, when the country was facing the beginning of a power struggle in the political and social field between the factions [[Islam|Muslim]] and [[Christianity|Christian]]. Finally this struggle gave as a result the start of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975 - 1990). The situation in the country was unstable and a sluggish economy and an increasingly bloody civil war that prevented raising their children; Many people decided to again begin to migrate.

The people emigrated mainly to countries of [[Latin America]], among which are: Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Panama; there were also significant numbers who moved to [[Canada]] and [[US]]. These migrations are mostly round trips: after achieving a stable economic support the immigrant population Baaloul returns again to dedicate himself to building homes for their families.

[[Colombia]] it was one of the main destinations of emigration of people. Among the 70, 80 and 90 the Department of [[Colombian Guajira]], specifically the population of [[Maicao]] was one of the places where the community was established. Today you can see a strong presence of migrants from Baaloul in the area.

[[Venezuela]] is another destination countries, with the [[Isla Margarita]] and the Economic Zone Paraguan√° in the city of [[Punto Fijo]] where migrants are highly concentrated, focusing mainly trade dry goods.

[[Panama]] in the 80's and 90 received the community of Baaloul, which focused on the [[Colon Free Zone]], on the outskirts of [[Panama Canal]] imposing a trade regime and business in the locality.

[[Brazil]] is one of the countries with the largest Lebanese communities around the world, even higher than the current population of [[Lebanon]]. Baaloul villagers are in the triple border [[Foz do Iguacu]] in the Province of [[Paran√° (state)|Parana]].

Today, the population is divided Baaloul and ranks twenty-four family names surnames. These families joined entirely to a population of more than 1,200 people.

The official language of [[Lebanon]] is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and as a second language [[French language|French]]; however Baaloul the main language spoken by the community, both within the town and beyond this is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], given the number of emigrants to Spanish-speaking countries. After the Spanish the most widely used languages are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the [[English language|English]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

==History==

The origins of the Bhagavata Mela are in [[Kuchipudi]], another more ancient classical Indian dance, found in [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Projesh Banerji|title=Indian Ballet Dancing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5fXZKe3xHQAC&amp;pg=PA42|year=1983|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-0-391-02716-9|pages=42‚Äì43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of the region by Islamic armies led to the fall of a Hindu empire, which triggered the mass migration of Hindu performance artist families to Tamil Nadu in 16th century, where the dance evolved into modern Bhagavata Mela.&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt; Prior to its fall, the court records of the Deccan region based [[Vijayanagara Empire]] ‚Äì known for its patronage of the Indian religions and arts ‚Äì indicate that drama-dance troupes of ''Bhagavatas'' from Kuchipudi village performed at the royal court.{{Sfn|Ragini Devi|1990|pp=67-68}}{{Sfn|Reginald Massey|2004|pp=79-80}} The region saw wars and political turmoil, ending in the formation of Deccan Sultanates in 16th century.&lt;ref name="Latif2010p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bilkees I.

Kuchipudi declined and was a dying art in 17th-century Andhra,&lt;ref name="Latif2010p71" /&gt; but in 1678, the last Shia Muslim [[Nawab]] of [[Golkonda Sultanate|Golkonda]], [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah]], saw a Kuchipudi performance and was so pleased that he granted the dancers lands around the Kuchipudi village, with the stipulation that they continue the dance-drama.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dances of India: A General Survey and Dancers' Guide|last=Massey|first=Reginald|last2=Massey|first2=Jamila|publisher=Tricolour Books|year=1989|isbn=0-948725-04-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kuchipudi: Indian Classical Dance Art|last=Kothari|first=Sunil|last2=Pasricha|first2=Avinash|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=2001|isbn=9788170173595|location=India|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shia Sultanate was overthrown in 1687 by the Sunni Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]].&lt;ref name="Latif2010p71" /&gt; In order to regulate public and private morals, as well as end un-Islamic practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ahsan Jan Qaisar|author2=Som Prakash Verma|author3=Mohammad Habib|title=Art and Culture: Endeavours in Interpretation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hic3XnRU-VgC&amp;pg=PA7 |year=1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-315-1 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurangzeb banned public performances of all music and dance arts, along with ordering the confiscation and destruction of musical instruments in Indian subcontinent under control of his [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref name="Eraly2000p408"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Eraly|title=Emperors of the Peacock Throne: The Saga of the Great Mughals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04ellRQx4nMC |year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-100143-2 |pages=408‚Äì409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohan Khokar|title=Traditions of Indian classical dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prjnAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Peter Owen |isbn=978-0-7206-0574-7|pages=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These families maintained their Kuchipudi-inspired dance drama culture, in a form called Bhagavata Mela.&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt;

==Repertoire==
The Bhagavata Mela is traditionally celebrated in Hindu temple grounds or next to a temple, starting after dusk and through the night, and like the original Kuchipudi artists, male [[Brahmin]]s were the artists who played the role of men and women characters in the underlying story.&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FisherShay2009p388"/&gt; Modern productions include both male and female artists, and has evolved to show influences of both Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam ‚Äì the main classical dance of Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name=brandon10&gt;{{cite book|author1=James R.

Like all classical dances of India, the Bhagavata Mela incorporates sophisticated gestures as sign language combined with intricate footwork and acting (''abhinaya'') to communicate a religious story with spiritual message.&lt;ref name=rubin139/&gt;&lt;ref name=brandon10/&gt; These aspects of the Bhagavata Mela have roots in the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', the ancient Hindu text on performance arts.{{Sfn|Ragini Devi|1990|pp=67-68}} The performance includes ''Nritta'', ''Nritya'' and ''Natya''. The ''Nritta'' performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of pure dance.&lt;ref name=koskoff955/&gt; The ''Nritya'' is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes.&lt;ref name=koskoff955&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellen Koskoff|title=The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: The Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73MO0eiQD_EC&amp;pg=PA955 |year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-99404-0 |pages=955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Natya'' is a play performed by a team of artists.{{Sfn|Reginald Massey|2004|pp=33-38, 83-84, 207-214}}&lt;ref name="NettlStone1998p516"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruno Nettl|author2=Ruth M.

The communication in Bhagavata Mela is in the form of expressive gestures (mudras or hastas) synchronized to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the ''ras'' (sentiment, emotional taste) and ''bhava'' (mood) of the underlying story.&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82"/&gt; Like other Hindu classical dances, the artist successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: ''Angika'' (gestures and body language), ''Vachika'' (song, recitation, music and rhythm), ''Aharya'' (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry), and ''Sattvika'' (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates).&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tanvi Bajaj |author2=Swasti Shrimali Vohra|title=Performing Arts and Therapeutic Implications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRcCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-32572-7 |pages=82‚Äì84}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abhinaya'' draws out the ''bhava'' (mood, psychological states).&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82"/&gt;

The Bhagavata Mela stories are typically from the Hindu Epics or the [[Puranas]], with ''Prahlada Charitram'' being particularly popular.&lt;ref name=rubin139/&gt; The music is [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] style, and most of the underlying story is sung to the rhythm of the music while the dance artists perform.&lt;ref name=brandon10/&gt; The repertoire is aided by an orchestra of musical instruments, with [[mridangam]] (drum) and cymbals providing the beat, and flute, string instruments and harmonium completing the ensemble.&lt;ref name=brandon10/&gt;

The '''Brahma Sa·πÅhitƒÅ''' is a [[Sanskrit]] [[Pancaratra|Pa√±carƒÅtra]] text, composed of verses of prayer spoken by [[Brahma]] glorifying the supreme [[Lord Krishna|Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa]] or Govinda at the beginning of creation. It is revered within [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gau·∏çiya Vai·π£·πáavism]], whose 16th-century founder, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Caitanya MahƒÅprabhu]] (1486‚Äì1534), rediscovered a part of the work, the 62 verses of Chapter 5, which had previously been lost for a few centuries, at the [[Adikesava Perumal Temple, Kanyakumari|Adikeshav Temple in Thiruvattar]], Tamil Nadu, [[South India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.indiadivine.org/brahma-samhita/ A history of the Brahma Sa·πÅhitƒÅ], Feb 17, 2012, (Indiadivine.org)&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsunori Matsubara, in his ''Pa√±carƒÅtra Sa·πÅhitƒÅs and Early Vais·πáava Theology'' dates the text at ca 1300 CE. The text contains a highly esoteric description, with the KƒÅma-[[Gayatri|GƒÅyat·πõi]], of K·πõ·π£·πáa in His abode [[Goloka]].

In 1970, [[George Harrison]] produced a modern recording of these prayers performed by devotees of the [[Radha Krsna Temple|RƒÅdha K·πõ·π£·πáa Temple]] in London. Titled "[[Govinda (Radha Krishna Temple song)|Govinda]]", the song took its title from the main chorus line of the prayer '''"govindam ƒÅdi-puru·π£am tam aha·πÅ bhajƒÅmi"''', meaning "I worship [[Govinda]], the primeval Lord". This prayer was sung by YamunƒÅ Devi, a disciple of [[Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami PrabhupƒÅda]].

==Recovered text==
The recovered fragment of the ''[http://www.vedabase.com/en/bs/5 ≈örƒ´ Brahma-samhitƒÅ]'' commences at the fifth chapter, whose first verse states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''ƒ´≈õvara·∏• parama·∏• k·πõ·π£·πáa·∏• sac-cid-ƒÅnanda-vigraha·∏•''
''anƒÅdir ƒÅdir govinda·∏• sarva kƒÅra·πáa kƒÅra·πáam ≈õloka 5.1''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This translates to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;[[Krishna|K·πõ·π£·πáa]], who is known as [[Govinda]], is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vedabase.com/en/bs/5/1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The text was first translated from Sanskrit into English by [[Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur|Bhakti SiddhƒÅnta Sarasvatƒ´ ·π¨hƒÅkura]] in 1932 and is often sung or recited as both a [[Bhakti|devotional]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophical]] text.

'''Central Valley Wicca''', sometimes abbreviated as '''CVW''', refers to a particular group of traditions within the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] religion of [[British Traditional Wicca|Wicca]] which trace their roots to a group of Wiccan practitioners who brought their practice from [[England]] to the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of [[California]] at some point in the early 1960s.  It is one branch of [[British Traditional Wicca]], alongside [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]], [[Alexandrian Wicca]] and [[Mohsian Wicca|Mohsian]], as defined by New Wiccan Church in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newwiccanchurch.org/articles/btwfaq.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727122512/http://www.newwiccanchurch.org/articles/btwfaq.htm |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }} New Wiccan Church Article: British Traditional Wicca F.A.Q.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several theories about the origins of Central Valley Wicca, leading to a degree of debate among researchers. Some speculate that CVW is an early offshoot or even a precursor of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], while others suggest that the CVW share a common ancestor with what later became Gardnerian Wicca.  According to their original custom, an initiate of Central Valley Wicca was not told who their initiator's initiator was; therefore, the identity of the person who first brought Wicca to the Central Valley remains a mystery. What is known is that she had ties to England and had most likely lived there; she was either British or had close connection to a British subject prior to settling in California.

At that time, individual names for "traditions" of Wicca were not in use; they simply called themselves "Wicca." Today, however, the various branches of Wicca that descend from the Central Valley Wicca have developed into traditions in their own right, including Silver Crescent, Kingstone, Daoine Coire, Assembly of Wicca, and Majestic. Some of the offshoot traditions from CVW have blended in influences from other related Pagan paths, although most retain the core essence of CVW.

Central Valley Wicca shares basic beliefs with, and has similar ritual structures and practices to, other forms of British Traditional Wicca as they are practiced in England. However, their interpretation of some of the material is unique, and their lore is similar but not identical.

'''Daria Morgendorffer''' is a fictional character from the [[MTV]] animated series ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' and its spin-off ''[[Daria]]''. She was voiced in both incarnations by Tracy Grandstaff.

In 2002, Daria placed at number 41 on the list of the'' Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters'' of all Time by ''[[TV Guide]]'' for her role in the two shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters.list/index.html "''TV Guide''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603000000/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters.list/index.html |date=June 3, 2009 }}", [[CNN]], July 30, 2002. Retrieved on October 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She was also listed in AOL's 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Potts|first=Kim|title=100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/03/02/top-tv-women-75-51/|work=AOL TV|accessdate=July 20, 2012|date=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception and development==
[[Glenn Eichler]] created the Daria character.&lt;ref name="Gates"&gt;{{cite news|first=Anita|last=Gates|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/16/arts/television-radio-in-praise-of-the-most-unpopular-girl-at-lawndale.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title='Daria': In Praise of the Most Unpopular Girl at Lawndale|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=May 16, 1999|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MTV senior vice president and creative director Abby Terkuhle explained that when ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' "became successful, we ... created Daria's character because we wanted a smart female who could serve as the [[Foil (literature)|foil]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Mangan|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/13512116.html?dids=13512116:13512116&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+17%2C+1997&amp;author=Jennifer+Mangan.+Special+to+the+Tribune.&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=%60DARIA%27+DELIVERS+A+BIG+DOSE+OF+SOPHIXTICATED+HUMOR&amp;pqatl=google|title='Daria': Brainy = Zany in MTV's irreverent view of 'girl humor'|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[tronc]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=August 17‚Äì23, 1997|accessdate=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terkuhle said that he added Daria "to put [Beavis and Butt-Head] in their place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rick|last=Marin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/style/comic-cretins.html?pagewanted=2|title=Comic Cretins|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 11, 1993|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ''Beavis and Butt-Head''==
In Daria's first incarnation as a recurring character on ''Beavis and Butt-Head'', she formed an intelligent female foil to the two main characters. She went through three different outfits, had a stockier figure, and initially was a more expressive character; her iconic monotone voice would only develop over time. She would become more sardonic over time, but showed early on that she could hold her own against the two and could react fast to their antics.

She had a minor role in her first appearance, "Sign Here". She answered questions from Van Driessen on furriers and their treatment of animals. In her second episode with them, "Scientific Stuff", she was forced to do a science class presentation with them and turned it to her advantage by using them ''as'' the presentation's experiment. In later appearances, she would alternate between being irritated by their antics and finding their stupidity to be amusing: in "Sprout", she specifically came over to watch them fail at planting seeds, and in "Walkathon" she got them to unwittingly pledge $100 apiece on a charity walkathon. In "Sporting Goods" she gave three eye-popping gasps while Beavis and Butt-head wear eye patches as athletic supporters, which is a dramatic contrast to her monotonous behavior in the later series. She lacked the passionate hatred for them that [[Principal McVicker]] and [[Coach Buzzcut]] had and was one of the very few characters that would willingly seek them out, but did not really believe there is any hope for them either as [[David Van Driessen]] had.  On multiple occasions, she took it upon herself to explain simple concepts to them, such as informing them in "U.S. History" what graduation was (Beavis responded, "You mean, like...school ends?") and in "Sprout" that you put seeds in the ground.

In a Christmas special, it is stated that Butt-Head had been responsible for giving her a negative outlook on boys. Aside from that, she was one of the few characters that the duo never managed to drive crazy as they had with many other students and teachers. Butt-Head would sometimes treat her with some degree of respect, following her advice in "Sprout" and chuckling "Daria's ''cool!''" after she asked [[Bill Clinton]] if "you were just jerking us around" on a campaign promise.

John J. O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes Daria as "as sharp as B. &amp; B. are dimwitted."&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite news|first=John J.|last=O'Connor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/03/arts/teen-ager-s-scornful-look-at-cuteness.html|title=Teen-Ager's Scornful Look at Cuteness|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=March 3, 1997|accessdate=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Allemang of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' described Daria in ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' "the prematurely wise girl who could be counted on to put their idiocy in perspective."&lt;ref name="Allemang"&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Allemang|title=Finally, a TV teen who comes close to feeling real FINE TUNING|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=March 19, 1999|quote=She wears bulky shapeless sweaters, hides behind thick round glasses, talks in a blas√© monotone and is both the disappointment of her overachieving parents and an embarrassment to her boy-crazy sister Quinn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beavis and Butt-Head often call her "[[Diarrhea]]".&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt;

In the final episode of season 7, when the boys were believed dead, Daria expressed the sentiments that "I guess it's sad they're dead", but they did not have very bright futures to look forward to.

Daria appeared frequently in the [[Marvel Comics]] adaptation of the TV show, and also got to appear on the cover of one issue and "answer" the fan mail in two others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outpost-daria.com/ch_diarrhea.html "Daria on Beavis and Butt-head"], Outpost-Daria.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530002713/http://www.outpost-daria.com/ch_diarrhea.html |date=May 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]'', she appears once throughout the film with a group of students, but does not have any dialogue.

Daria's own show would never mention Beavis and Butt-Head and only named Highland once at the beginning of the first episode of season one, carried over from the original and unbroadcast pilot. Despite this, it was frequently noted in media articles about the show that it was a spin-off from ''Beavis and Butt-Head''. In an "interview" on ''CBS Early Show'' on January 21, 2002, Daria was asked by [[Jane Clayson Johnson|Jane Clayson]] if she kept in touch with Beavis and Butt-Head; she responded "I'd like to, but first they'd have to figure out that when the telephone makes that funny sound, you're supposed to pick it up and say hello".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outpost-daria.com/media_art28.html Transcript of ''CBS Daily Show'' "interview"], Outpost-Daria.com  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106055930/http://www.outpost-daria.com/media_art28.html |date=January 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As revealed in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview with Mike Judge, Daria would not return to the new episodes of ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' in 2011, but she was referenced in "[[Drones (Beavis and Butt-head)|Drones]]" during a music video when Beavis assumed she had committed suicide. However, Butt-Head incredulously tells his friend "What are you talking about, Beavis? Daria didn't die, she just moved away".

== In ''Daria'' ==

In the series ''[[Daria]]'' which followed ''Beavis and Butt-head'', Daria remains bespectacled and plain. She is an unfashionably dressed, highly intellectual, entirely [[pessimism|pessimistic]] about life altogether, cynical, and sarcastic teenage girl who is portrayed as an icon of sanity in an insane household in an equally insane [[upper middle class]] [[suburb]]. She resides with her vacuous, fashion-obsessed younger sister [[Quinn Morgendorffer|Quinn]] and career-obsessed parents [[Helen Morgendorffer|Helen]] and [[Jake Morgendorffer|Jake]]. John Allemang of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' said that Daria is "both the disappointment of her overachieving parents and an embarrassment to her boy-crazy sister Quinn."&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt; She had moved to a new school, having transferred from the one in ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''. [[Glenn Eichler]] said, in relation to ''Daria'' the series, of which he was a co-creator, "I like to think that I've helped her come out of her shell."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;

David L. Coddon of the ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' described Daria as "the anti-cheerleader, the un-social climber, the jaundiced eye in a cartoon world of too much makeup and superficial crayon colors." Coddon added that Daria "may look like a misfit, but the catch is that Daria's the only character on the show who 'gets it.' It's everyone else who's a misfit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|first=David L.|last=Coddon|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/70574421.html?dids=70574421:70574421&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+05%2C+2001&amp;author=David+L.+Coddon&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;desc=Wearing+her+cynicism+well%2C+Daria+is+best-dressed+in+class&amp;pqatl=google|title=Wearing her cynicism well, Daria is best-dressed in class|newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]|publisher=Nant Capital LLC|location=San Diego, California|date=April 5, 2001|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daria states in the first episode that she does not have low [[self esteem]]: she has low esteem for everybody else.&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt; Anita Gates of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "The secret of Daria's popularity (everywhere but in her own home and school) may be our collective alienation."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; Gates says that "her tastes are a little dark."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; As an example, Gates used the fact that she reads "[[Howl]]" by [[Allen Ginsberg]] at a reading to the elderly program.&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;

Eichler said, "Apparently everyone, with the exception of a very few people who were hit on the head when they were very young, felt like they were outsiders. You either identify with her as an outsider or you sort of envy her ability to navigate her life as an outsider and stay sane."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; John J. O'Connor, a television critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', said "In short, Daria is the perfect anti-Barbie Doll. Merchants of fashion and cosmetics are beneath her contempt. Her refusal to be Miss Goody Consumer borders on the truly subversive."&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt; He concludes that Daria "is every glorious misfit I ever knew."&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"/&gt;

Allemang said that in ''Daria'', Daria "seems more tortured and neurotic, if only because it's more clear that the airheads have won."&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt; Daria often talks to herself. Allemang adds "in a perky-teen world with its twisted values, [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]] are the best hope of intelligent conversation."&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt; In addition he said "There's nothing intrinsically wrong with Daria, just because she can't or won't hang out with the cool kids."&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt; John J. O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that Daria has "a withering eye" towards her classmates.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt; [[Emily Nussbaum]] for ''Slate'' would praise the show for both having a character that many disaffected teenagers could relate to and for showing "the flipside of her principled withdrawal from the world: her crippling terror of rejection, a streak of ugly self-righteousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Emily|last=Nussbaum|authorlink=Emily Nussbaum|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2002/01/requiem_for_daria.html|title=Requiem for ''Daria'': ''Daria'' slips into the ''Ghost World'' of great high-school drama|website=[[Slate.com]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|location=New York City| |date=January 21, 2002|accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daria likes to watch the fictitious television show ''Sick, Sad World''.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt; Gates added that "Daria is the kind of girl who reads ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s '[[The Tell-Tale Heart|Telltale Heart]]' in class."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;

=== Relationships with other characters ===
Anita Gates of ''[[The New York Times]]'' says "The Morgendorffers don't even seem to notice that Daria constantly gives them lip."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; In one scene, when Helen, her mother, says, "There's no course that can teach you to be a perfect mother," Daria responds "That's obvious."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; Gates says that "nobody sends her to her room."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; Gates also said that Daria's popular, self-absorbed sister [[Quinn Morgendorffer|Quinn]] is "the greatest burden on the home front."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; [[Jane Lane (Daria)|Jane Lane]], Daria's best friend, met her at a self-esteem class. Gates adds that Jane "knows all of Daria's peculiarities and still loves her."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; Gates said that Daria's "silent intense crush" on Jane's brother [[Trent Lane|Trent]] is her "only discernible weakness" and that "the absolute proof that Jane is a good friend is that she knows how Daria feels about Trent and will never, ever tell."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; In spite of her early infatuation with Trent, Daria's most significant romantic relationship is with [[Tom Sloane]], who entered the show at the end of the third season and rapidly became Jane's love interest before beginning a relationship with Daria that continued throughout the rest of the show and caused some friction between Daria and Jane.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dariawiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Tom_Sloane|title=Tom Sloane - DariaWiki|publisher=DariaWiki|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movies===
The first ''Daria'' movie, ''Is It Fall Yet?'', gave the principal characters time apart from one another in parallel narratives which foreshadowed further changes in their relationships.

By the time of the finale movie ''Is It College Yet?'', Daria's character has undergone noticeable growth. She chooses to attend Raft College. She graduates from Lawndale High, winning the [[Dian Fossey]] Award "for dazzling academic achievements in face of near total [[misanthropy]]", and crowning her acceptance speech with the assertion that "there is no aspect, no facet, no moment of life that can't be improved with [[pizza]]".

== Appearance ==
Daria wears rounded thick glasses, an orange T-shirt underneath a green jacket, a black skirt, and black boots. John Allemang of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' said "to surrender is to be normal, to sacrifice your brain in the rush to be popular and wear uncomfortable shoes that make your legs look hot. Daria, as always, keeps her integrity. She wears sensible shoes, and finds her intellectual reward in not being hot."&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt;

In ''Beavis and Butt-Head'', Daria wears square glasses, a leather jacket, white T-shirt, a red skirt, black leggings and black boots. In the earlier episodes, she is seen wearing a brown jacket, beige skirt, green shirt and brown boots.

== MTV "host" ==

During her run on MTV, Daria would narrate or "host" special events and shows, either with a real-life presenter or with Jane. She was part of the Cool Crap Auction in 1999, giving an overview of the goods for auction and talking "live" to the winner of one prize, answering machine messages recorded by her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outpost-daria.com/ts_coolcrap.html Cool Crap Auction transcript] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711000000/http://www.outpost-daria.com/ts_coolcrap.html |date=July 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daria and Jane also hosted MTV's ''Top Ten Animated Videos Countdown'' and two ''Daria Day'' marathons of their episodes; the ''Countdown'' and second marathon segments are included on the 2010 DVD release.

==Cameos==
Daria makes a brief cameo in the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode "Lost in Parking Space, Part Two". She is being [[tortured]] in the basement of a [[Hot Topic]] along with other cartoon characters. She has a nail being hammered into her eye and says, "This is men's fault", in her infamous monotone and is rather indifferent to the pain.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Lost in Parking Space, Part Two]]" ''[[Drawn Together]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, at one point in the MTV animated series ''[[Undergrads]]'', Gimpy is talking to his friends via webcam when a female hacker hacks into the video stream and edits Gimpy to look like Daria.

In late 2010, following the DVD release, Daria was licensed as a voice for [[Garmin]] and [[TomTom]] GPS systems; original putdowns and jokes were recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navtones.com/daria-voice-for-gps.html Navtones.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029022007/http://www.navtones.com/daria-voice-for-gps.html |date=October 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Carol A. Stabile and Mark Harrison, authors of ''Prime Time Animation: Television Animation and American Culture'', said that "for the cerebral, writerly types who liked television Daria was the outcast she-hero who dared to say things they were too scared to say in their teenage years."&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Carol A.|last1=Stabile|first2=Mark|last2=Harrison|title=Prime Time Animation: Television Animation and American Culture|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Abingdon, New Jersey|date=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3USAr6i1e0C&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=daria+morgendorffer#v=onepage&amp;q=daria%20morgendorffer&amp;f=false|ISBN=978-0-415-28326-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Toffler, then the general manager of MTV, said in 1998 that Daria "has an attitude about parents, school, and siblings that is common to the experiences of our audience. She is a good spokesperson for MTV... intelligent but subversive."&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"/&gt; A 1997 ''[[The Nation]]'' article referred to Daria as "a 10th grade [[Dorothy Parker]]."&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"/&gt; Another critic praising the character said that she is like "a 50-year-old deadpan [[Jews|Jewish]] comic in the body of a 16-year-old."&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"/&gt; Jennifer Vineyard, a writer of ''[[My Life as Liz]]'', said "Daria made it cool to be a smart chick." Vineyard added, "Just the presence of people or characters like Daria help make it cool to be yourself. There's a tendency for young girls to play dumb. Characters like Daria show you that you don't have to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Henry|last=Hanks|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/15/mtv.liz.go/?hpt=C2|title='My Life as Liz' and the evolution of the MTV nerd|website=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|date=February 15, 2011|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators believed that the character's [[deadpan]] humor had too much morbidity for the teenage audience. A critic said that Daria uses her "omnivorous deadpan" contempt against other people, represented a variety of "living death", and was "a [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]] in a dress" who was more dangerous than [[Marilyn Manson]].&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"/&gt; Anita Gates of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "And some people like her just because she says mean things. As far as I can tell, with her show well into its third season [...], Daria has never cracked a smile."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1001">'''Dharmaratna''', '''Gobharana''', or '''Zhu Falan''' (Á´∫Ê≥ïËò≠) was an Indian [[Buddhist monk]] who is traditionally believed to have first introduced [[Buddhism]] to [[China]] in the 1st century CE.

According to popular accounts of [[Chinese Buddhism]], [[Emperor Ming of Han]] dreamt of a golden deity interpreted as the [[Buddha]] and sent a delegation to India. They returned circa 67 CE with the monks [[Kasyapa Matanga]] and Dharmaratna, and white horses carrying [[Buddhist texts]] and images. The emperor established [[White Horse Temple]] in the Han capital [[Luoyang]], where the two supposedly first translated the ''[[Sutra of Forty-two Chapters]]'' into Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhism-dict.net/cgi-bin/xpr-ddb.pl?8f.xml+id('b8fe6-8449-6469-9a30') Á´∫Ê≥ïËò≠], ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'' (login: guest, no password).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social science]], '''disenchantment''' ({{lang-de|Entzauberung}}) is the cultural [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] and devaluation of [[religion]] apparent in modern society. The term was borrowed from [[Friedrich Schiller]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jenkins, [http://maxweberstudies.org/kcfinder/upload/files/MWSJournal/1.1pdfs/1.1%2011-32.pdf Disenchantment, Enchantment and Re-Enchantment] (2000) 1 ''Max Weber Studies'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Max Weber]] to describe the character of [[modernized]], [[bureaucratic]], [[secularized]] [[Western World|Western society]], where scientific understanding is more highly valued than belief, and where processes are oriented toward rational goals, as opposed to [[traditional society]], where for Weber, "the world remains a great enchanted garden".&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enlightenment ambivalence==

Weber's ambivalent appraisal of the process of disenchantment as both positive ''and'' negative&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Cascardi, ''The Subject of Modernity'' (1992) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up by the [[Frankfurt school]] in their examination of the self-destructive elements in [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism.&lt;ref&gt;G. Borradori, ''Philosophy in an Age of Terror'' (2004) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J√ºrgen Habermas|Habermas]] has subsequently striven to find a positive foundation for [[modernity]] in the face of disenchantment, even while appreciating Weber's recognition of how far secular society was created from, and is still "haunted by the ghosts of dead religious beliefs".&lt;ref&gt;Murray E. G. Smith, ''Early Modern Social Theory'' (1998) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have seen the disenchantment of the world as a call for [[Existentialism|existentialist]] commitment and individual responsibility before a collective normative void.&lt;ref&gt;L. Embree ed., ''Schutzian Social Science'' (1999) p. 110-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacralization==

Disenchantment is related to the notion of desacralization, whereby the structures and institutions that previously channeled spiritual belief into rituals that promoted collective identities came under attack and waned in popularity. According to [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], the ritual of sacrifice involved two processes: sacralization and desacralization. The first process endows a profane offering with sacred properties‚Äîconsecration‚Äîwhich provides a bridge of communication between the worlds of the sacred and profane. Once the sacrifice has been made, the ritual must be desacralized in order to return the worlds of the sacred and profane to their proper places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}} p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Disenchantment operates on a macro-level, rather than the micro-level described above. It also destroys part of the process whereby the chaotic social elements that require sacralization in the first place continue with mere knowledge as their antidote. Thereby disenchantment can be related to Durkheim's concept of [[anomie]]: an un-mooring of the individual from the ties that bind in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bell&lt;/ref&gt;{{RefImprove|section|date=December 2016}}

==Reenchantment==

In recent years, Weber's paradigm has been challenged by thinkers who see a process of "reenchantment" operating alongside that of disenchantment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua Landy]] and Michael Saler, eds., ''The Re-Enchantment of the World: Secular Magic in a Rational Age'', Stanford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, enchantment is used to fundamentally change how even low paid service work is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Endrissat, N., Islam, G., &amp; Noppeney, C. (2015). Enchanting Work: New Spirits of Service Work in an Organic Supermarket. Organization Studies, 36(11), 1555‚Äì1576. http://doi.org/10.1177/0170840615593588.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jung]] considered [[Symbol#Psychoanalysis and archetypes|symbols]] to provide a means for the [[numinous]] to return from the unconscious to the desacralized world&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 83-94&lt;/ref&gt; - a means for the recovery of [[myth]], and the sense of wholeness it once provided, by a disenchanted modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Casement, ''Who Owns Jung?'' (2007) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Gellner]] argued that though disenchantment was the inevitable product of modernity, many people just could not stand a disenchanted world, and therefore opted for various "re-enchantment creeds" (as he called them) such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[Marxism]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinianism]]{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[ethnomethodology]]. A noticeable feature of these re-enchantment creeds is that they all tried to make themselves compatible with naturalism: i.e., they did not refer to supernatural forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hall]], ''Ernest Gellner: An Intellectual Biography'', Verso, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Ruickbie]] showed on the basis of research in the [[Neopagan]] community that modern magical practitioners demonstrated re-enchantment. Using both qualitative participant research and quantitative survey analysis he was able to demonstrate a range of re-enchanted characteristics conforming to those extrapolated from Weber's theories.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Ruickbie, 'The Re-Enchanters: Theorising Re-Enchantment and Testing for its Presence in Modern Witchcraft', unpublished PhD thesis, King's College, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo Ruickbie, 'Weber and the Witches: Sociological Theory and Modern Witchcraft', Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies, 2006, 116-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disenchantment as Myth===

American [[historian of religion]] Jason Josesphson-Storm has challenged mainstream sociological and historical interpretations of the ideas of both disenchantment and reenchantment, labeling disenchantment as a "myth." Josephson-Storm argues that there has not been a decline in belief in magic or mysticism in Western Europe or the United States, even after adjusting for religious belief, education, and class.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephson-Storm has further argued that many influential theorists of disenchantment, including Weber and some members of the [[Frankfurt School]], were not only aware of modern European magical and occult movements but consciously engaged with them.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 215, 269-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Foundational theorists of disenchantment such as Weber and [[James George Frazer]] did not envision a rigid binary between rationality or rationalization and magical thinking and did not describe a process of "reenchantment" to reverse or compensate for disenchantment.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 277-8, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephson-Storm, this information necessitates a re-interpretation of Weber's idea of disenchantment as referring more to the sequestering and professionalization of magic.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Having previously written about external obstacles in his book ''The Obstacle Is the Way'', Holiday sought to answer questions about what to do when the biggest obstacle is internal.&lt;ref name="forA"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2016/06/14/ryan-holiday-how-ego-makes-business-leaders-less-successful/#3c9333b44906 | title = Ryan Holiday: How Ego Makes Business Leaders Less Successful | date= 14 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Forbes'' | author = Dan Schwabel }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the prologue of the book, Holiday explains how finding early successes led him to the realization that ego can cloud ambition and hinder personal and professional growth, particularly when accomplishments are tied to self-worth.&lt;ref name="BIA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/ryan-holiday-changing-the-world-can-be-a-dangerous-goal-2016-6 | title = Why you should think twice before aiming to 'change the world' | date= 24 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Business Insider'' | author = Anisa Purbasari }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holiday had the title of his book tattooed on his forearm as a daily reminder of its message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/why-ego-toxic-leadership/leadership-lessons/article/1415069 | title = Why ego is toxic to leadership | date= 9 November 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Management Today'' | author = Adam Gale }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Ego Is the Enemy'' puts forth the argument that often our biggest problems are not caused by external factors such as other people or circumstances. Instead, our problems stem from our own attitude, selfishness and self-absorption. In other words, introducing ego into a situation often prevents us from being rational, objective and clear headed.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fox7austin.com/good-day/161094637-story | title = 'Ego Is the Enemy' | date= 17 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Fox 7'' | author = Amanda Salinas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book does not discuss [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Freud's ego]] or [[egotism]] as a clinical term but rather ego in a colloquial sense, defined as "an unhealthy belief in your own importance."&lt;ref name="hpA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/why-ego-is-the-enemy-in-b_b_10527208.html | title = Why Ego Is the Enemy in Business and in Life | date= 17 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Huffington Post'' | author = Quora }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also discusses the difference between ego and confidence, and argues that the solution to the problem of ego is humility, self-awareness, purpose and realism.&lt;ref name="forA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/the_moment/2016/05/ryan_holiday_on_stoicism_and_why_ego_is_the_enemy.html | title = Ryan Holiday Talks Stoicism and Why Ego Is the Enemy | date= 4 May 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Slate'' | author = Brian Koppelman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qz"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://qz.com/848324/how-can-i-find-a-career-that-makes-me-happy/ | title = A career counselor at an elite college says students should follow their purpose in life‚Äînot their passion | date= 30 November 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Quartz'' | author = Mike O'Connor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ego Is the Enemy'' provides both cautionary tales as well as positive anecdotes about ego, citing numerous historical and contemporary figures including [[Christopher McCandless]], [[George Marshall]], [[John DeLorean]], [[Larry Page]], [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]], [[Steve Jobs]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].&lt;ref name="forA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BIA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wts"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.in/Refusing-to-run-for-president-was-the-unexpected-key-to-this-Civil-War-commanders-success/articleshow/53086737.cms | title = Refusing to run for president was the unexpected key to this Civil War commander's success | date= 6 July 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Business Insider'' | author = Anisa Purbasari }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fort"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fortune.com/2016/06/14/ego-steve-jobs/ | title = How Ego Almost Destroyed Steve Jobs‚Äô Career | date= 14 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Fortune'' | author = Ryan Holiday }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Ego Is the Enemy'' has received generally positive reviews, with ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside Magazine]]'' commenting, "Holiday takes philosophy out of the ivory towers and translates often-dense concepts into actionable insights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.outsideonline.com/2087791/how-can-i-bulletproof-my-mind-get-more-out-my-body | title = How Can I Bulletproof My Mind to Get More Out of My Body? | date= 8 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Outside'' | author = Brad Stulberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://smallbiztrends.com/2016/11/ego-is-the-enemy-book-review.html | title = The Antidote to the Success Paradox is to Realize that Ego is the Enemy | date= 27 November 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Small Business Trends'' | author = Charles Franklin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was featured in the ''[[NPR]]'' Book Concierge Guide To 2016‚Äôs Great Reads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.npr.org/best-books-2016/ NPR‚Äôs Book Concierge: Our Guide To 2016‚Äôs Great Reads] ''NPR''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5891">[[File:Maya Hieroglyphs Fig 05.jpg|thumbnail|Ek Chuaj, The Merchant Deity (God M)]]

'''Ek Chuaj''', also known as '''Ek Chuah''', '''Ekchuah''', '''God M''' according to the [[Schellhas-Zimmermann-Taube classification]] of [[codical gods]], is a [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[merchant]] deity as well as a patron of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]].&lt;ref name=Sharer&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sharer | first1 = Robert J. | last2 = Traxler | first2 = Loa P. | title = The Ancient Maya | year = 2006 | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford, Calif. | isbn = 978-0-8047-4816-2 | pages = 736‚Äì743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ek Chuaj is part of a [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|pantheon of Maya deities]] that have been depicted in [[Maya script|hieroglyphs]] and artwork of various Maya sites and has been interpreted as a significant part of [[Maya religion]].

==Description==
Ek Chuaj can either be depicted as black-and-white striped, as he is in the [[Dresden Codex]], or entirely black, as he is in the [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]]. Other distinguishing characteristics of Ek Chuaj are his mouth, which is encircled by a red-brown border, his large lower lip, and the presence of two curved lines to the right of his eye. Other depictions of Ek Chuaj show him as an old man with only a single tooth. This is the appearance he most regularly takes in the Madrid Codex. He has been depicted with a pack of goods commonly carried by [[Trade in Maya civilization|merchants]], and his carrying of a burden is also indicated by the rope or [[tumpline]] tied around his head. He may also carry a spear and, in some instances, a scorpion's tail.&lt;ref name="www.gutenberg.org"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Schellhas | first = Paul | title = Representation of Deities of the Maya Manuscripts | url = https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18013/18013-h/18013-h.htm#I_REPRESENTATIONS_OF_GODS | publisher =  | date =  2006-03-18| accessdate = 6 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

=== Mentioned in: [[History of chocolate|The history of Chocolate]] ===

Ek Chuaj holds various meanings depending upon the contexts in which he is depicted. His principal associations are with trade and cacao use.

===As a Merchant Deity===
Ek Chuaj is often depicted carrying a pack and a spear, indicating transportation of goods as well as the dangerous life of a merchant. In this context, Ek Chuaj is a patron deity of travelers and journeys. During journeys, travelers would stack three stones on top of each other and offer incense to Ek Chuaj at night to ensure a safe journey home.&lt;ref name="Sharer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hagar&gt;Hagar, 1900, 100-101&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Ek Chuaj and the "Guide of the Merchant," otherwise known as [[Polaris]] or the North Star, are related both symbolically and linguistically. "''Ek''" can be translated as either "black" or "star".&lt;ref name=Hagar&gt;Hagar, 1900, 100-101&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a Patron of Cacao===
Cacao was one of the most important products traded by Maya merchants and it was often treated as [[currency]]. Because Ek Chuaj is a patron of cacao, owners of cacao groves would hold ceremonies or special festivals in his honor. One of these was held during Muwan, a "month" in the Maya solar calendar or ''[[haab']]''. The presence of this ceremony suggests that Ek Chuaj was an agriculturally symbolic deity within Maya society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kepecs |first1=Susan |chapter=Ek Chuah Encounters the Holy Ghost in the Colonial Labyrinth: Ideology and Commerce on Both Sides of the Spanish Invasion |editor1-last=Funari |editor1-first=Pedro Paulo A. |editor2-last=Senatore |editor2-first=Maria Ximena |title=Archaeology of Culture Contact and Colonialism in Spanish and Portuguese America |isbn=978-3-319-08068-0 |page=108|date=2014-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interactions with Other Deities==
Ek Chuaj is sometimes depicted in combat, most often with [[Buluk Chabtan]] ([[Maya mythology|God F]]) the god of war, violence, and sacrifice. This interaction has been interpreted as representing the need for traveling merchants to have the ability to ward off hostile attacks. In the Madrid Codex, Ek Chuaj and [[God L]] are closely related and sometimes nearly indistinguishable from one another.&lt;ref name=Taube&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Taube | first = Karl | title = The Major Gods of the Ancient Mexico |jstor=41263477 | publisher = Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University |date=n.d. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that God L was a Classic Maya counterpart of Ek Chuaj. As Ek Chuaj gained influence and importance, he supplanted God L.&lt;ref name="www.gutenberg.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/pari/publications/RT03/Schele1976-OCR.pdf |title=Accession Iconography of Chan-Bahlum in the Group of the Cross at Palenque|first= Linda |last=Schele|year= 1976|website= www.mesoweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, Ek Chuaj seems have attributes of other deities. For example, in one instance he is depicted with the head of an old man, the spine of [[Maya death gods|a death god]], and the tail of a scorpion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6687">'''Erusin''' ({{Hebrew|◊ê◊ô◊®◊ï◊°◊ô◊ü}}) is the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term for [[betrothal]]. In [[modern Hebrew]], "erusin" means [[engagement]], but this is not the historical meaning of the term, which is the first part of marriage (the second part being ''[[nissuin]]'').&lt;ref name="JewEncBet"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=betrothal|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=995&amp;letter=B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Middle Ages]]&lt;ref name="JewEncMarLaw"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=marriage ceremonies|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&amp;artid=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is customary for the marriage to occur immediately after the betrothal, and to perform the betrothal during the marriage ceremony itself. Previously this was not the case, and there were often several months between the two events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ketubot (Talmud)|Ketubot]] 57b&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hebrew]] and [[classical rabbinic literature]], betrothal is frequently referred to as sanctification (Hebrew: ''Kiddushin'', ◊ß◊ô◊ì◊ï◊©◊ô◊ü), on account of the bride becoming "sanctified" (dedicated) to the groom.

== In the Hebrew Bible ==

The idea of erusin as the minimum necessary condition to apply the [[death penalty]] for [[adultery]], but less than a complete marriage, appears in [[Deuteronomy]].

A non-traditional view is that the betrothal was effected simply by purchasing the girl from her father (or guardian). The price paid for her ([[bride price]]) is known by the Hebrew term ''mohar'' (◊û◊ï◊î◊®&amp;lrm;).&lt;ref name="Genesis3412"&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|34:12|}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:16-17|}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|20:7|}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:29|}}, {{bibleverse||Hosea|2:19-20|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girl's consent is not explicitly required by any statement in the Bible,&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar"&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=MARRIAGE|section=Manius-Mash}}&lt;/ref&gt; neither is there explicit permission to ignore it. Yet, as the servant of Abraham was seeking a Bride for Isaac, and discovered Rebekah living in Haran, her father Bethuel, and her brother Laban, said, "Let us call the young woman and ask her." And they called Rebekah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" She said, "I will go."(Genesis 24:57, 58) It was customary in [[biblical times]] for the bride to be given part of the ''mohar''.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=marriage|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&amp;artid=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually it lost its original meaning, and the custom arose of giving the ''mohar'' entirely to the bride, rather than to her father.

The traditional commentators do not necessarily explain ''mohar'' this way. Rashi understands ''mohar'' as a form of ''[[ketubah]]'', an agreement to pay a certain amount upon divorce,&lt;ref&gt;Rashi Genesis 34:12; Exodus 22:16, Mikraot Gedolot, six volume Shilo edition, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nachmanides]] understands it as ''sovlanut'', a sort of dowry or engagement present.&lt;ref&gt;Ramban, Exodus 22:16, Chavel edition, Mossad HaRav Kook, Jerusalem, 5732&lt;/ref&gt; Rashi understands Rachel and Leah's complaint to Jacob ("we are considered strangers to him for he has sold us"&lt;ref&gt;''Halo nachriot nechshavnu lo ki m'charanu''&lt;/ref&gt;) as saying that it was not normal for a father to sell his daughters, at least not without also giving them a [[dowry]].&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 314:15, Mikraot Gedolot, six volume Shilo edition, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Talmud ==

=== The legal act ===

The Talmud states that there are three methods of performing erusin; by handing the woman a coin or object of nominal value, by handing her a document and through [[consummation]] (sexual intercourse), although the last is prohibited by the [[Talmud]].&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Kidushin 12b&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases the woman's consent is required; however, it can be implied by her silence.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, ''Consent''  (http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=736&amp;letter=C)&lt;/ref&gt; In religious law, two valid witnesses must see the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Danzig]], ''[[Hokhmat Adam|Wisdom of Man]]'' 129:16&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ceremony ==
{{Main|Jewish wedding}}

=== The blessings ===
The erusin is preceded by a blessing over wine and then the ''bircat erusin'' (betrothal blessing).&lt;ref name="RLamm15"&gt;The Jewish Way in Love &amp;amp; Marriage, Rabbi Maurice Lamm, Harper &amp;amp; Row, 1980, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; If forgotten before the ceremony, it can be recited before the [[ketubah]] is read.&lt;ref name="RKap20"&gt;Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Moznaim Publishing Company, New York / Jerusalem, 1983, Chapters 20 and 21&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the blessings were recited by the groom but today it is more common for someone else to recite them such as the wedding's Rabbi.&lt;ref name="JewEncMarLaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RLamm15"/&gt;

=== The betrothal ===
Today, the custom is to perform the betrothal by giving the bride an object whose value is well known, and fairly constant: a gold [[wedding ring|ring]] without a stone. This is in accordance with the first method mentioned above.

The actual betrothal now takes place. The groom takes the ring and says in Hebrew, ''Behold, you are consecrated to me with this ring according to the laws of Moses and Israel''. The groom now places the ring on the bride‚Äôs index finger.&lt;ref name="RKap20"/&gt;

=== The ketubah ===
In order to separate the erusin and nissuin - the two parts of the wedding - the [[ketubah]] is now read.&lt;ref name="JewEncBet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RKap20"/&gt;

=== Other issues ===
For legal purposes, a betrothed couple is regarded as husband and wife. Similarly, the union can only be ended by the same divorce process as for married couples. However, betrothal does not oblige the couple to behave towards each other in [[Conjugal obligations and rights in Judaism|the manner that a married couple is required to]], nor does it permit&lt;ref&gt;Text of the Birkat Erusin&lt;/ref&gt; the couple to have a sexual relationship with each other.

The rabbis prohibited marrying without an [[engagement]] (''[[shiddukhin]]''). Therefore, an old custom is to sign a ''[[:he:◊™◊†◊ê◊ô◊ù (◊ê◊ô◊®◊ï◊°◊ô◊ù)|Shetar haT'na'im]]'' as a formal form of engagement, forming an informal declaration of the couple's intentions,&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Binyamin. ''Sefer haNisuim Kehilchatam'', haMesorah Publishing, Jerusalem, 1985. chapter 3, paragraph 184-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and is read close to the start of the betrothal ceremony.

In the 1980s, a new movement known as Dominion Theology or the Reconstructionist Movement surfaced among conservative Evangelicals. This group interpreted the Bible ‚Äì especially the Old Testament ‚Äì as commanding believers ‚Äúto restore‚Äù each nation according to theocratic principles and to promote Evangelical moral paradigms. Reconstructionists affirm an eschatological and political vision founded on the belief that Christians were destined to govern the world.  Many prominent Evangelical politicians in Latin America have embraced this ideology. They seek to bring others to their faith not only because of their propensity for proselytism but also because of their conviction that, once a nation reaches a critical mass of believers, the Spirit will pour out God‚Äôs justice and prosperity upon the population (Smith &amp; Campos, 2012). Undoubtedly, this ideology is present, in one form or another, in other contexts and people need to be aware of its presence.  It is worth noting that nowhere that the Reconstructionists have held power or influence ‚Äì in Guatemala, Brazil, Nicaragua, El Salvador or Peru, for example ‚Äì have they been able successfully to model sound public governance nor successfully resolve such issues as systemic corruption and violence. But they are present, they have money, and they often have access to media and to opinion leaders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar movements often interconnected or analogous according to some analysts are the [[Tea Party movement]], the [[Christian right]], the [[neo-nationalism]], the [[alt-right]] and the [[conservative wave]]. 

[[Roman Catholics]] in Latin America tend to be more left-wing in economics&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Julia |title=The Church in Latin America |url=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/church-latin-america |accessdate=2 June 2018 |agency=Commonweal Magazine |date=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pew2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Christianity and Conflict in Latin America |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2006/04/06/christianity-and-conflict-in-latin-america/ |accessdate=2 June 2018 |agency=Pew Research Center |date=6 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the traditional teachings of the [[Catholic social doctrine]] and the [[Christian Democracy]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Evangelical Christians on the other hand are mostly from the [[Neo-Pentecostalism|neo-Pentecostal movement]] and thus believers in the [[Prosperity Theology]] which justify most of their [[neoliberal]] economic ideas.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

==History==
[[Protestant missionary]] groups mainly from the [[Charismatic Movement]] originated in the [[Deep South]] of the [[United States]] were introduced deliberately as an strategy from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] particularly during [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican administrations]] as a way to reduce the influence of left-leaning Catholic movements like [[Liberation Theology]] (which was popular among many [[far-left]] [[political parties]] and [[guerrillas]]) and the more moderate [[Christian socialist]] and [[Christian Democratic]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sabanes Plou |first1=Dafne |title=Ecumenical history of Latin America |url=http://www.overcomingviolence.org/en/about-dov/annual-focus/2006-latin-america/ecumenical-history-of-latin-america.html |website=Overcoming Violence |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aj"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Arsenault |first1=Chris |title=Evangelicals rise in Latin America |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/03/201232593459332334.html |accessdate=1 November 2018 |agency=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=26 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Catholic blogger [[Jorge Rond√≥n]] in his essay: ''La Expansi√≥n del Protestantismo Fue Parte del Plan de Guerra de la CIA para Am√©rica del Sur'' (The Expansion of Protestantism Was Part of CIA War Plan for South America), [[US President]] [[Richard Nixon]] encouraged the introduction of Protestant missions after a 1969 memorandum received by then [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]] which stated: "the Catholic church has ceased to be an ally in whom the U.S. can have confidence."&lt;ref name="severo"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Severo |first1=Julio |title=The Religious War between CIA and KGB in Latin America |url=https://medium.com/@juliosevero/the-religious-war-between-cia-and-kgb-in-latin-america-50d7ade40b95 |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Something confirmed by Wade Clark Roof in his book ''World Order and Religion''.&lt;ref name="severo" /&gt; Guatemalan archbishop [[Pr√≥spero Penados]] also blamed the US for encouraging and sponsor Evangelicalism in Guatemala for, according to him, more political than religious reasons arguing that: "The diffusion of Protestantism in Guatemala is more part of an economic and political strategy" to oppose the Catholic [[social justice]] doctrine.&lt;ref name="keely"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keeley |first1=Theresa |title=Medell√≠n Is "Fantastic": Drafts of the 1969 Rockefeller Report on the Catholic Church |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3891504451/medell-n-is-fantastic-drafts-of-the-1969-rockefeller |website=Questia |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several scandals involving the Catholic church, particularly those of [[Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church|sexual abuse]], gravely affected the image of the institution causing an important drain of followers, some of which became [[irreligious]], [[agnostics]] and [[atheist]] some went to other alternative religions like [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[New religious movements]], but a large segment of former Catholics, particularly those of more humble origins and lower classes, went into the [[Evangelical Churches]], particularly those of [[neo-Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismatic]] movements.&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion in Latin America |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2014/11/13/religion-in-latin-america/ |website=Pew Research Center |accessdate=1 November 2018 |date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pentecostalism]] also became popular among the lower income classes and the most abandoned sectors of society specially those of very poor and periphreal areas who see the Churches ideas of economic growth through faith as an opportunity for social movility.&lt;ref name="pew" /&gt; In any case the growth of Evangelicals was quickly followed by their newly discovered political and electoral weight, with new forms of political activism and even the creation of specific political parties connected to their communities.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Davis |first1=Joseph |title=Evangelical Growth and Politics in Latin America |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1991/05/002-evangelical-growth-and-politics-in-latin-america |accessdate=1 November 2018 |agency=First Thing |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guatemalan dictator [[Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt]] was one of the first Evangelical Christians in attain power in Latin America's history.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="severo" /&gt;

Countries with notorious conservative right-wing candidates supported by Evangelicals include [[Venezuela]] where pastor [[Javier Bertucci]] was the third more voted nominee, [[Costa Rica]] where preacher and [[Gospel singer]] [[Fabricio Alvarado]] went into the electoral run-off&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; and Brazil where Evangelical Christians were pivotal in the triumph of [[Jair Bolsonaro]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schipani |first1=Andres |last2=Leahy |first2=Joe |title=Jair Bolsonaro courts Brazil‚Äôs evangelical Christians |url=https://www.ft.com/content/d9939a48-d33d-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5 |accessdate=1 November 2018 |agency=[[Financial Times]] |date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Warren |first1=Steven |title=How Evangelical Christians Helped Elect Brazil's New President |url=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2018/october/how-evangelical-christians-helped-elect-brazils-new-president |accessdate=1 November 2018 |agency=CBN |date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chayenne" /&gt;

==Differences with Roman Catholics ==

* [[Social conservativism]]: According to the [[Pew Research Center]]: "Even though the Catholic Church opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, Catholics in Latin America tend to be less conservative than Protestants on these kinds of social issues. On average, Catholics are less morally opposed to abortion, homosexuality, artificial means of birth control, sex outside of marriage, divorce and drinking alcohol than are Protestants."&lt;ref name="pew" /&gt;
* [[Economic liberalism]]: Catholic also tend to be more [[Economic progressivism|economically progressive]] having a tendency of supporting more left-wing and [[Welfare State]]&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pew2" /&gt; position in varying degress from far-left [[Liberation Theology]] which permates in many left-wing parties, to much more moderate [[Christian socialist]] and [[Christian Democratic]] postures.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Evangelicals on the other hand (although exceptions exists) tend to be economically right-wing, staunchly anti-communist and support [[liberal economy]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pew2" /&gt; 
* [[Social class|Class]]: In Latin America most neo-Pentecostals and other Evangelicals are mostly from [[working class]] and [[Low class|lower-income groups]], whilst Catholicism is still prevalent among [[Middle class|middle]] and [[High Class|high classes]] and among profesionals and the political elite.&lt;ref name="pew" /&gt;
* [[Zionism]]: The Catholic position regarding the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]] may vary greatly, however and although strong Israel-supporters among Catholics is not unusual, [[anti-Zionism]] is also prevalent among both far-left (specially [[Liberation Theology]] and [[Christian Left]] Catholics) and the far-right ([[Traditionalist Catholicism|Traditionalists]], [[Sedevacantism|Sedevacantistas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Berich |first1=Heidy |title=Radical Traditionalist Catholics Spew Anti-Semitic Hate, Commit Violence Against Jews |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2007/radical-traditionalist-catholics-spew-anti-semitic-hate-commit-violence-against-jews |website=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zionism |url=https://www.scripturecatholic.com/zionism/ |website=Catholic Scripture |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.) [[Holy See|The Vatican]] has its [[Apostolic Nunciature|diplomatic representation]] in [[Tel Aviv]] and recognizes the [[State of Palestine]] advocating for a [[two-state solution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel, Palestine needs two-state solution, Pope Francis says in Christmas message |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-25/pope-francis-urges-two-state-solution-in-christmas-address/9285280 |accessdate=1 November 2018 |agency=ABC |date=25 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Middle East: Holy See Affirms Two-State Solution in Palestine |url=https://zenit.org/articles/middle-east-holy-see-affirms-two-state-solution-in-palestine/ |accessdate=1 November 2018 |agency=Zenit |date=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus many centrist Catholics follow this lines. On the other hand Evangelical Christians tend to be overwhelmingly pro-Israel and support the recognition of Jerusalem as its capital.&lt;ref name="tupac" /&gt;&lt;ref name="baeza" /&gt;

'''Saint Francis of Assisi''' ({{lang-it|San Francesco d'Assisi}}, {{lang-la|Sanctus Franciscus Assisiensis}}), born '''Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone''', informally named as '''Francesco''' (1181/1182{{snds}}3 October 1226),&lt;ref name="cefa"/&gt; was an Italian [[Catholic]] [[friar]], [[deacon]] and preacher. He founded the men's [[Order of Friars Minor]], the women's [[Order of Saint Clare]], the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]] and the [[Custody of the Holy Land]]. Francis is one of the most venerated religious figures in history.&lt;ref name = "EBO Francis"/&gt;

[[Pope Gregory IX]] canonized Francis on 16 July 1228. Along with [[Saint Catherine of Siena]], he was designated [[Patron saint]] of [[Italy]]. He later became associated with patronage of animals and the [[natural environment]], and it became customary for Catholic and Anglican churches to hold ceremonies blessing animals on his [[feast day]] of 4 October. He is often remembered as the patron saint of animals. In 1219, he went to Egypt in an attempt to convert the Sultan to put an end to the conflict of the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Tolan |title=St. Francis and the Sultan: The Curious History of a Christian-Muslim Encounter |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780199239726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, the [[Franciscans|Franciscan Order]] had grown to such an extent that its primitive organizational structure was no longer sufficient. He returned to Italy to organize the Order. Once his community was authorized by the Pope, he withdrew increasingly from external affairs. Francis is also known for his love of the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://franciscanfriars.com/vocations/stfrancis/ |title=St. Francis of Assisi ‚Äì Franciscan Friars of the Renewal |publisher=Franciscanfriars.com |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1223, Francis arranged for the first [[Christmas]] live [[nativity scene]].&lt;ref&gt;The Christmas scenes made by Saint Francis at the time were not inanimate objects, but live ones, later commercialised into inanimate representations of the Blessed Lord and His parents.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Christmas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cefa"/&gt; According to Christian tradition, in 1224 he received the [[stigmata]] during the [[Vision (spirituality)|apparition]] of [[Seraph]]ic angels in a [[religious ecstasy]],&lt;ref name="ODCC Francis"/&gt; which would make him the first person in Christian tradition to bear the wounds of [[Passion (Christianity)|Christ's Passion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Stigmatization |editor-last=Cross |editor-first=F.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Francis of Assisi was born in late 1181 or early 1182, one of several children of an [[Italians|Italian]] father,  Pietro di Bernardone, a prosperous silk merchant, and a [[French people|French]] mother, Pica de Bourlemont, about whom little is known except that she was a noblewoman originally from [[Provence]].&lt;ref name="Lives"&gt;{{cite book | last = Englebert | first = Omer | title = The Lives of the Saints | place = New York  | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble | isbn = 978-1-56619-516-4 | year = 1951 | page = 529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pietro was in France on business when Francis was born in [[Assisi]], and Pica had him [[baptized]] as Giovanni.&lt;ref name="dukemag"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dukemagazine.duke.edu/article/blessing-all-creatures-great-and-small|title= Blessing All Creatures, Great and Small|accessdate=2007-07-30 |work=Duke Magazine|date= November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro took to calling his son Francesco ("the Frenchman"), possibly in honor of his commercial success and enthusiasm for all things French.&lt;ref name="Chesterton"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chesterton | first = Gilbert Keith | author-link = G.

[[File:Casa-de-sao-francisco.jpg|thumb|left|The house where Francis of Assisi lived when young]]

Indulged by his parents, Francis lived the high-spirited life typical of a wealthy young man.&lt;ref name="ODCC Francis"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Francis of Assisi |editor-last=Cross |editor-first=F. L. |title=The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0199566712 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a youth, Francesco became a devotee of [[troubadours]] and was fascinated with all things [[Transalpine]].&lt;ref name="Chesterton"/&gt;  He was handsome, witty, gallant, and delighted in fine clothes. He spent money lavishly.&lt;ref name="cefa"/&gt; Although many [[Hagiography|hagiographers]] remark about his bright clothing, rich friends, and love of pleasures,&lt;ref name="Lives"/&gt; his displays of disillusionment toward the world that surrounded him came fairly early in his life, as is shown in the "story of the beggar". In this account, he was selling cloth and velvet in the marketplace on behalf of his father when a beggar came to him and asked for [[alms]]. At the conclusion of his business deal, Francis abandoned his wares and ran after the beggar. When he found him, Francis gave the man everything he had in his pockets. His friends quickly chided and mocked him for his act of charity. When he got home, his father scolded him in rage.&lt;ref name="chest41"&gt;Chesterton (1924), pp.&amp;nbsp;40‚Äì41&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1202, he joined a military expedition against [[Perugia]] and was taken as a prisoner at Collestrada, spending a year as a captive.&lt;ref name="Bonaventure"&gt;
{{Cite book  | author1 = Bonaventure | author2 = Cardinal Manning | author-link = Bonaventure | title = The Life of St. Francis of Assisi (from the Legenda ancti Francisci) | place = [[Rockford, Illinois]] | publisher = TAN Books &amp; Publishers | isbn = 978-0-89555-343-0 | year = 1867 | edition = 1988 | page = 190 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; An illness caused him to re-evaluate his life. It is possible that his spiritual conversion was a gradual process rooted in this experience. Upon his return to Assisi in 1203, Francis returned to his carefree life. In 1205, Francis left for [[Apulia]] to enlist in the army of [[Walter III, Count of Brienne]]. A strange vision made him return to Assisi, having lost his taste for the worldly life.&lt;ref name="ODCC Francis"/&gt; According to [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts, thereafter he began to avoid the sports and the feasts of his former companions. In response, they asked him laughingly whether he was thinking of marrying, to which he answered, "Yes, a fairer bride than any of you have ever seen", meaning his "Lady Poverty".&lt;ref name="cefa"/&gt; 
[[File:Sassetta 001.jpg|thumb|''Saint Francis Abandons His Father''. Francis of Assisi breaking off his relationship with his father and renouncing his patrimony, laying aside publicly even the garments he had received from him.]]
On a [[pilgrimage]] to Rome, he joined the poor in begging at [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]].&lt;ref name="ODCC Francis"/&gt; He spent some time in lonely places, asking God for [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment]]. He said he had a mystical [[visions of Jesus and Mary|vision of Jesus Christ]] in the forsaken country chapel of [[San Damiano, Assisi|San Damiano]], just outside Assisi, in which the [[San Damiano cross|Icon of Christ Crucified]] said to him, "Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you can see, is falling into ruins." He took this to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so he sold some cloth from his father's store to assist the priest there for this purpose.&lt;ref name="chest54"&gt;Chesterton (1924), pp.&amp;nbsp;54‚Äì56&lt;/ref&gt; When the priest refused to accept the ill-gotten gains, an indignant Francis threw the coins on the floor.&lt;ref name="cefa"/&gt;

In order to avoid his father's wrath, Francis hid in a cave near San Damiano for about a month. When he returned to town, hungry and dirty, he was dragged home by his father, beaten, bound, and locked in a small storeroom. Freed by his mother during Bernardone's absence, Francis returned at once to San Damiano, where he found shelter with the officiating priest, but he was soon cited before the city consuls by his father. The latter, not content with having recovered the scattered gold from San Damiano, sought also to force his son to forego his inheritance by way of restitution. In the midst of legal proceedings before the [[Bishop of Assisi]], Francis renounced his father and his [[Property|patrimony]].&lt;ref name="cefa"/&gt;
 
For the next couple of months Francis wandered as a beggar in the hills behind Assisi. He spent some time at a neighbouring monastery working as a scullion. He then went to Gubbio, where a friend gave him, as an alms, the cloak, girdle, and staff of a pilgrim. Returning to Assisi, he traversed the city begging stones for the restoration of St. Damiano's. These he carried to the old chapel, set in place himself, and so at length rebuilt it. Over the course of two years, he embraced the life of a [[penitent]], during which he restored several ruined chapels in the countryside around Assisi, among them San Pietro in Spina (in the area of San Petrignano in the valley about a kilometer from Rivotorto, today on private property and once again in ruin); and the [[Porziuncola]], the little chapel of [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli|St. Mary of the Angels]] in the plain just below the town.&lt;ref name="cefa"/&gt; This later became his favorite [[Dwelling|abode]].&lt;ref name="chest54"/&gt; By degrees he took to nursing [[leper]]s, in the [[lazar house]]s near [[Assisi]].

===Founding of the Franciscan Orders===
====The Friars Minor====
One morning in February 1208, Francis was hearing Mass in the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, near which he had then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the "Commissioning of the Twelve" from the Book of Matthew. The disciples are to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty. Having obtained a coarse woolen tunic, the dress then worn by the poorest Umbrian peasants, he tied it around him with a knotted rope and went forth at once exhorting the people of the country-side to penance, brotherly love, and peace. Francis' preaching to ordinary people was unusual since he had no license to do so.&lt;ref name = "EBO Francis"/&gt;
 
His example drew others to him. Within a year Francis had eleven followers. The brothers lived a [[simple living|simple life]] in the deserted [[lazar house]] of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they spent much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of [[Umbria]], making a deep impression upon their hearers by their earnest exhortations.&lt;ref name="cefa"/&gt;

[[File:Legend of St. Francis by Giotto.jpg|thumb|left|The Pope approving the statutes of the Order of the Franciscans, by [[Giotto]], 1295‚Äì1300]]
In 1209 he composed a simple rule for his followers ("friars"), the ''Regula primitiva'' or "Primitive Rule", which came from verses in the Bible. The rule was "To follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and to walk in his footsteps". He then led his first eleven followers to Rome to seek permission from [[Pope Innocent III]] to found a new religious Order.&lt;ref name="chest107"&gt;Chesterton (1924), pp.&amp;nbsp;107‚Äì108&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entry to Rome, the brothers encountered Bishop Guido of Assisi, who had in his company [[Giovanni di San Paolo]], the [[Cardinal Bishop of Sabina]]. The Cardinal, who was the confessor of Pope Innocent&amp;nbsp;III, was immediately sympathetic to Francis and agreed to represent Francis to the pope. Reluctantly, Pope Innocent agreed to meet with Francis and the brothers the next day. After several days, the pope agreed to admit the group informally, adding that when God increased the group in grace and number, they could return for an official admittance. The group was [[tonsure]]d.&lt;ref name="Francis of Assisi and His World"&gt;Galli(2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;74‚Äì80&lt;/ref&gt; This was important in part because it recognized Church authority and prevented his following from possible accusations of heresy, as had happened to the [[Waldensians]] decades earlier. Though a number of the Pope's counselors considered the mode of life proposed by Francis as unsafe and impractical, following a dream in which he saw Francis holding up the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] (the cathedral of Rome, thus the 'home church' of all Christendom), he decided to endorse Francis' Order. This occurred, according to tradition, on April 16, 1210, and constituted the official founding of the [[Franciscan Order]].&lt;ref name = "EBO Francis"/&gt; The group, then the "Lesser Brothers" (''Order of Friars Minor'' also known as the ''Franciscan Order'' or the ''Seraphic Order''), were centered in the Porziuncola and preached first in Umbria, before expanding throughout Italy.&lt;ref name = "EBO Francis"/&gt; Francis chose never to be ordained a priest, although he was later ordained a deacon.&lt;ref name="cefa"/&gt;

====The Poor Clares and the Third Order====
[[File:Josep Benlliure Gil17.jpg|thumb|St. Clare is received by St. Francis, Josep Benlliure]]
From then on, the new Order grew quickly with new vocations.  Hearing Francis preaching in the church of [[Assisi Cathedral|San Rufino]] in Assisi in 1211, the young noblewoman [[Clare of Assisi]] became deeply touched by his message and realized her calling. Her cousin Rufino, the only male member of the family in their generation, was also attracted to the new Order, which he joined. On the night of [[Palm Sunday]], March 28, 1212, Clare clandestinely left her family's palace. Francis received her at the Porziuncola and thereby established the Order of Poor Ladies.&lt;ref name="chest110"&gt;Chesterton (1924), pp.&amp;nbsp;110‚Äì111&lt;/ref&gt; This was an Order for women, and he gave Clare a [[religious habit]], or garment, similar to his own, before lodging her in a nearby monastery of [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] nuns until he could provide a suitable retreat for her, and for her younger sister, [[Agnes of Assisi|Caterina]], and the other young women who had joined her. Later he transferred them to San Damiano,&lt;ref name = "EBO Francis"/&gt; to a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge. This became the first monastery of the Second Franciscan Order, now known as [[Poor Clares]].&lt;ref name="cefa"/&gt;

For those who could not leave their homes, he later formed the [[Third Order of Saint Francis|Third Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance]], a fraternity composed of either [[laity]] or clergy whose members neither withdrew from the world nor took [[religious vows]]. Instead, they observed the principles of Franciscan life in their daily lives.&lt;ref name = "EBO Francis"/&gt; Before long, this Third Order grew beyond Italy. The Third Order is now titled the [[Secular Franciscan Order]].

===Travels===
Determined to bring the Gospel to all peoples of the World, Francis sought on several occasions to take his message out of Italy. In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem, but was shipwrecked by a storm on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, forcing him to return to Italy. On May 8, 1213, he was given the use of the mountain of [[La Verna]] (Alverna) as a gift from [[Count]] Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as ‚Äúeminently suitable for whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;Fioretti quoted in: St. Francis, ''The Little Flowers, Legends, and Lauds'', trans. N. Wydenbruck, ed. Otto Karrer (London: [[Sheed and Ward]], 1979) 244.&lt;/ref&gt;The mountain would become one of his favourite retreats for prayer.&lt;ref name="chest130"&gt;Chesterton (1924), p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, Francis sailed for Morocco, but this time an illness forced him to break off his journey in Spain. Back in Assisi, several noblemen (among them [[Tommaso da Celano]], who would later write the biography of St. Francis), and some well-educated men joined his Order. In 1215, Francis may have gone to Rome for the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], but that is not certain. During this time, he probably met a [[canon (priest)|canon]], [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzman]]&lt;ref name="chest126"&gt;Chesterton (1924), p.126&lt;/ref&gt; (later to be Saint Dominic, the founder of the Friars Preachers, another [[Catholic religious order]]). In 1217, he offered to go to France. Cardinal Ugolino of Segni (the future Pope Gregory IX), an early and important supporter of Francis, advised him against this and said that he was still needed in Italy.

In 1219, accompanied by another friar and hoping to convert the Sultan of Egypt or win martyrdom in the attempt, Francis went to Egypt during the [[Fifth Crusade]] where a Crusader army had been encamped for over a year besieging the walled city of [[Damietta]] {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} upstream from the mouth of one of the main channels of the Nile. The Sultan, [[al-Kamil]], a nephew of [[Saladin]], had succeeded his father as Sultan of Egypt in 1218 and was encamped upstream of Damietta, unable to relieve it. A bloody and futile attack on the city was launched by the Christians on August 29, 1219, following which both sides agreed to a ceasefire which lasted four weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, Steven. ''History of the Crusades, vol. 3: The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades'', Cambridge University Press (1951, paperback 1987), pp. 151‚Äì161.&lt;/ref&gt; It was most probably during this interlude that Francis and his companion crossed the Muslims lines and were brought before the Sultan, remaining in his camp for a few days.&lt;ref&gt;Tolan, pp. 4f.&lt;/ref&gt; The visit is reported in contemporary Crusader sources and in the earliest biographies of Francis, but they give no information about what transpired during the encounter beyond noting that the Sultan received Francis graciously and that Francis preached to the Muslims without effect, returning unharmed to the Crusader camp.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Jacques de Vitry, Letter 6 of February or March 1220 and ''Historia orientalis'' (c. 1223‚Äì1225) cap. XXII; Tommaso da Celano, ''Vita prima'' (1228), ¬ß57: the relevant passages are quoted in an English translation in Tolan, pp. 19f. and 54 respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; No contemporary Arab source mentions the visit.&lt;ref&gt;Tolan, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; One detail, added by Bonaventure in the official life of Francis (written forty years after the event), has Francis offering to challenge the Sultan's "priests" to trial-by-fire in order to prove the veracity of the Christian Gospel.

Such an incident is alluded to in a scene in the late 13th-century fresco cycle, attributed to Giotto, in the upper basilica at Assisi.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Chesterton, ''Saint Francis'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton (1924) chapter 8.  Tolan (p.126) discusses the incident as recounted by Bonaventure, an incident which does not extend to a fire actually being lit.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the winged figures atop the columns piercing the roof of the building on the left of the scene are not idols (as [[Erwin Panofsky]] had proposed) but are part of the secular iconography of the sultan, affirming his worldly power which, as the scene demonstrates, is limited even as regards his own "priests" who shun the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;P√©ter Bokody, [https://www.academia.edu/1787059/Idolatry_or_Power_St._Francis_in_Front_of_the_Sultan  "Idolatry or Power: St. Francis in Front of the Sultan"], in: ''Promoting the Saints: Cults and Their Contexts from Late Antiquity until the Early Modern Period'', ed. Ott√≥ Gecser and others (Budapest: CEU Press, 2010), 69‚Äì81, esp. at pp. 74 and 76‚Äì78. The views of Panofsky (idols: see ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', New York 1972, p.148, n.3) and Tolan (undecided: p.143) are cited at p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonaventure, ''Legenda major'' (1260‚Äì1263), cap. IX ¬ß7‚Äì9, criticized by, e.g., Sabatier, ''La Vie de St. Fran√ßois d'Assise'' (1894), chapter 13, and Paul Moses, ''The Saint and the Sultan: The Crusades, Islam, and Francis of Assisi's Mission of Peace'', Doubleday Religion (2009) excerpted in a restricted-view article in ''Commonwealth'' magazine, September 25, 2009 [https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/mission-improbable  "Mission improbable: St. Francis &amp; the Sultan"], accessed 4 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bonaventure asserts that the sultan refused to permit the challenge, subsequent biographies went further, claiming that a fire was actually kindled which Francis unhesitatingly entered without suffering burns.  The scene in the fresco adopts a position midway between the two extremes. Since the idea was put forward by the German art historian, Friedrich Rintelen in 1912,&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Rintelen, ''Giotto und die Giotto-apokryphen'', (1912)&lt;/ref&gt; many scholars have expressed doubt that Giotto was the author of the Upper Church frescoes.

According to some late sources, the Sultan gave Francis permission to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land and even to preach there. All that can safely be asserted is that Francis and his companion left the Crusader camp for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], from where they embarked for Italy in the latter half of 1220. Drawing on a 1267 sermon by Bonaventure, later sources report that the Sultan secretly converted or accepted a death-bed baptism as a result of the encounter with Francis.&lt;ref&gt;For grants of various permissions and privileges to Francis as attributed by later sources, see, e.g., Tolan, pp. 258‚Äì263. The first mention of the Sultan's conversion occurs in a sermon delivered by Bonaventure on October 4, 1267. See Tolan, pp. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The Franciscan Order has been present in the [[Holy Land]] almost uninterruptedly since 1217 when Brother Elias arrived at Acre. It received concessions from the [[Mameluke]] Sultan in 1333 with regard to certain Holy Places in [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]], and (so far as concerns the Catholic Church) jurisdictional privileges from [[Pope Clement VI]] in 1342.&lt;ref&gt;Bulla ''Gratias agimus'', commemorated by Pope John Paul II in a [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/1992/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19921130_p-schalluuck_it.html Letter] dated November 30, 1992. See also Tolan, p.258. On the Franciscan presence, including an historical overview, see, generally the official website at [http://www.custodia.org/default.asp?id=425 ''Custodia''] and [[Custodian of the Holy Land]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reorganization of the Franciscan Order and death===
By this time, the growing Order of friars was divided into [[ecclesiastical province|provinces]] and groups were sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the martyrdom of five brothers in [[Morocco]], Francis returned to Italy via [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="b162"&gt;Bonaventure (1867), p.&amp;nbsp;162&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Pope Gregory IX|Ugolino di Conti]] was then nominated by the Pope as the protector of the Order. Another reason for Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate compared to previous religious orders, but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this growth and had little more to govern it than Francis' example and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared a new and more detailed Rule, the "First Rule" or "Rule Without a [[Papal Bull]]" (''Regula prima'', ''Regula non bullata''), which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it also introduced greater institutional structure, though this was never officially endorsed by the pope.&lt;ref name = "EBO Francis"/&gt;

On September 29, 1220, Francis handed over the governance of the Order to Brother Peter Catani at the Porziuncola, but Brother Peter died only five months later, on March 10, 1221, and was buried there. When numerous miracles were attributed to the deceased brother, people started to flock to the Porziuncola, disturbing the daily life of the Franciscans. Francis then prayed, asking Peter to stop the miracles and to obey in death as he had obeyed during his life.

The reports of miracles ceased. Brother Peter was succeeded by Brother Elias as [[Vicar]] of Francis. Two years later, Francis modified the "First Rule", creating the "Second Rule" or "Rule With a Bull", which was approved by Pope Honorius III on November 29, 1223. As the official Rule of the Order, it called on the friars "to observe the Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, living in obedience without anything of our own and in chastity". In addition, it set regulations for discipline, preaching, and entry into the Order. Once the Rule was endorsed by the Pope, Francis withdrew increasingly from external affairs.&lt;ref name = "EBO Francis"/&gt; During 1221 and 1222, Francis crossed Italy, first as far south as [[Catania]] in Sicily and afterwards as far north as [[Bologna]].
[[File:Cigoli, san francesco.jpg|thumb|Francis considered his [[stigmata]] part of the ''[[Imitation of Christ]]''.&lt;ref name=Goff&gt;Le Goff, Jacques. ''Saint Francis of Assisi'', 2003 {{ISBN|0-415-28473-2}} page 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Miles160&gt;Miles, Margaret Ruth. ''The Word made flesh: a history of Christian thought'', 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0846-1}} pages 160‚Äì161&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cigoli]], 1699]]

While he was praying on the mountain of Verna, during a forty-day fast in preparation for [[Michaelmas]] (September 29), Francis is said to have had a vision on or about September 14, 1224, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], as a result of which he received the [[stigmata]]. Brother Leo, who had been with Francis at the time, left a clear and simple account of the event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata. "Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, a six-winged angel on a cross. This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ."&lt;ref name="chest131"&gt;Chesterton (1924), p.131&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering from these stigmata and from [[trachoma]], Francis received care in several cities ([[Siena]], [[Cortona]], [[Nocera Umbra|Nocera]]) to no avail. In the end, he was brought back to a hut next to the Porziuncola. Here, in the place where it all began, feeling the end approaching, he spent the last days of his life dictating his spiritual Testament. He died on the evening of Saturday, October 3, 1226, singing Psalm 142 (141), ''"Voce mea ad Dominum"''.
&lt;!-- [[File:Traslaci√≥n de San Francisco de As√≠s, de Benet Mercad√©.jpg|thumb|The Passing of Saint Francis of Assisi (1866), by [[Benet Mercad√©]]]] --&gt;
On July 16, 1228, he was pronounced a saint by Pope [[Gregory IX]] (the former cardinal Ugolino di Conti, friend of Saint Francis and Cardinal Protector of the Order). The next day, the Pope laid the foundation stone for the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis]] in Assisi. Francis was buried on May 25, 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of Brother Elias to protect it from Saracen invaders. His exact burial place remained unknown until it was re-discovered in 1818. Pasquale Belli then constructed for the remains a crypt in neo-classical style in the Lower Basilica. It was refashioned between 1927 and 1930 into its present form by Ugo Tarchi, stripping the wall of its marble decorations. In 1978, the remains of Saint Francis were examined and confirmed by a commission of scholars appointed by [[Pope Paul VI]], and put into a glass urn in the ancient stone tomb.

==Character and legacy==
It has been argued that no one else in history was as dedicated as Francis to imitate the life, and carry out the work of Christ, in Christ‚Äôs own way‚Äî. This is important in understanding Francis' character and his affinity for the Eucharist and respect for the priests who carried out the sacrament.&lt;ref name = "EBO Francis"/&gt;

He and his followers celebrated and even venerated poverty. Poverty was so central to his character that in his last written work, the Testament, he said that absolute personal and corporate poverty was the essential lifestyle for the members of his Order.&lt;ref name = "EBO Francis"/&gt;

He believed that nature itself was the mirror of God. He called all creatures his ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù and ‚Äúsisters‚Äù, and even preached to the birds&lt;ref name="b78"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rR25UQD0E6YC&amp;pg=PT1 | title=The Little Flowers of St. Francis of Assisi | author=[[Ugolino Brunforte]] (Brother Ugolino) | publisher=[[Christian Classics Ethereal Library|CCEL]] | location=[[Calvin College]] | isbn=978-1-61025212-6| quote=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rR25UQD0E6YC&amp;pg=PT56&amp;dq=%22St.+Francis%22%22preach+to+the+birds%22 Quote].}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supposedly persuaded a wolf to stop attacking some locals if they agreed to feed the wolf. In his ''Canticle of the Creatures'' (‚ÄúPraises of Creatures‚Äù or ‚Äú[[Canticle of the Sun]]‚Äù), he mentioned the ‚ÄúBrother Sun‚Äù and ‚ÄúSister Moon‚Äù, the wind and water,. His deep sense of brotherhood under God embraced others, and he declared that ‚Äúhe considered himself no friend of Christ if he did not cherish those for whom Christ died‚Äù.&lt;ref name = "EBO Francis"/&gt;

Francis' visit to Egypt and attempted [[rapprochement]] with the Muslim world had far-reaching consequences, long past his own death, since after the fall of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader Kingdom]], it would be the Franciscans, of all Catholics, who would be allowed to stay on in the Holy Land and be recognized as "[[Custodian of the Holy Land|Custodians of the Holy Land]]" on behalf of the [[Catholic Church]].

At Greccio near Assisi, around 1220, Francis celebrated Christmas by setting up the first known ''presepio'' or ''cr√®che'' ([[Nativity scene]]).&lt;ref name="b178"&gt;Bonaventure (1867), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; His nativity imagery reflected the scene in traditional paintings. He used real animals to create a living scene so that the worshipers could contemplate the birth of the child Jesus in a direct way, making use of the senses, especially sight.&lt;ref name="b178"/&gt; Both Thomas of Celano and [[Saint Bonaventure]], biographers of Saint Francis, tell how he used only a straw-filled manger (feeding trough) set between a real [[ox]] and [[donkey]].&lt;ref name="b178"/&gt; According to Thomas, it was beautiful in its simplicity, with the manger acting as the altar for the Christmas Mass.

===Nature and the environment===
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--3 paragraphs without citations--&gt;
Francis preached the Christian doctrine that the world was created good and beautiful by God but suffers a need for redemption because of human sin. He believed that all creatures should praise God (a common theme in the Psalms) and the people have a duty to protect and enjoy nature as both the stewards of God's creation and as creatures ourselves.&lt;ref name="b78"/&gt; Many of the stories that surround the life of Saint Francis say that he had a great love for animals and the environment.&lt;ref name="b78"&gt;Bonaventure (1867), pp.&amp;nbsp;78‚Äì85&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Francis Statue 2.JPG|thumb|left|A garden statue of Francis of Assisi with birds]]
An incident illustrating the Saint's humility towards nature is recounted in the "Fioretti" ("Little Flowers"), a collection of [[legend]]s and folklore that sprang up after the Saint's death. One day, while Francis was traveling with some companions, they happened upon a place in the road where birds filled the trees on either side. Francis told his companions to "wait for me while I go to preach to my sisters the birds."&lt;ref name="b78"/&gt; The birds surrounded him, intrigued by the power of his voice, and not one of them flew away. He is often portrayed with a bird, typically in his hand.

Another legend from the ''[[Fioretti]]'' tells that in the city of [[Gubbio]], where Francis lived for some time, was a [[Wolf of Gubbio|wolf "terrifying and ferocious, who devoured men as well as animals".]] Francis had compassion upon the townsfolk, and so he went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon, fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, though the saint pressed on. When he found the wolf, he made the sign of the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed his jaws and lay down at Francis' feet.

"Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil", said Francis. "All these people accuse you and curse you ... But brother wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people." Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had ‚Äúdone evil out of hunger, the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly. In return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner [[Gubbio]] was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again. Finally, to show the townspeople that they would not be harmed, Francis blessed the wolf.

Three quarters of a millennium after his death, St Francis remains an important figure and symbol in and out of Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. On November 29, 1979, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared Saint Francis the Patron Saint of Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |title=Inter Sanctos (Apostolic Letter AAS 71) |author=[[Pope John Paul II]] |date=November 29, 1979 |accessdate=August 7, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809222858/http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |archive-date=2014-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the World Environment Day 1982, John Paul II said that Saint Francis' love and care for creation was a challenge for contemporary Catholics and a reminder "not to behave like dissident predators where nature is concerned, but to assume responsibility for it, taking all care so that everything stays healthy and integrated, so as to offer a welcoming and friendly environment even to those who succeed us." The same Pope wrote on the occasion of the World Day of Peace, January 1, 1990, the saint of Assisi "offers Christians an example of genuine and deep respect for the integrity of creation ..." He went on to make the point that: "As a friend of the poor who was loved by God's creatures, Saint Francis invited all of creation ‚Äì animals, plants, natural forces, even Brother Sun and Sister Moon ‚Äì to give honor and praise to the Lord. The poor man of Assisi gives us striking witness that when we are at peace with God we are better able to devote ourselves to building up that peace with all creation which is inseparable from peace among all peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/messages/peace/documents/hf_jp-ii_mes_19891208_xxiii-world-day-for-peace_en.html |title=World Day of Peace 1990 |author=[[Pope John Paul II]] |date=December 8, 1989 |accessdate=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Saint Pope John Paul II &lt;/b&gt; concluded that section of the document with these words, "It is my hope that the inspiration of Saint Francis will help us to keep ever alive a sense of 'fraternity' with all those good and beautiful things which Almighty God has created."

===Feast day===
[[File:Tomb of Saint Francis - Basilica di San Francesco - Assisi 2016.jpg|thumb|Francis' last resting place at [[Assisi]]]]

Saint Francis' [[feast day]] is observed on October 4. A secondary feast in honor of the [[stigmata]] received by Saint Francis, celebrated on September 17, was inserted in the [[General Roman Calendar]] in 1585 (later than the [[Tridentine Calendar]]) and suppressed in 1604, but was restored in 1615. In the New Roman Missal of 1969, it was removed again from the General Calendar, as something of a duplication of the main feast on October 4, and left to the calendars of certain localities and of the Franciscan Order.&lt;ref&gt;Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Wherever the traditional Roman Missal is used, however, the feast of the Stigmata remains in the General Calendar.  

On June 18, 1939, [[Pope Pius XII]] named Francis a joint [[Patron Saint]] of Italy along with [[Saint Catherine of Siena]] with the apostolic letter "Licet Commissa".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Pius XII]] (June 18, 1939). "Licet Commissa" (Apostolic Letter AAS 31, pp. 256‚Äì257)&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Pius also mentioned the two saints in the laudative discourse he pronounced on May 5, 1949, in the Church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]].

Saint Francis is honored in the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|Church of England]], the [[Calendar of saints (Anglican Church of Canada)|Anglican Church of Canada]], the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|Episcopal Church USA]], the [[Union of Utrecht (Old Catholic)|Old Catholic Churches]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], and other churches and religious communities on October 4. The [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], however, commemorates Saint Francis' feast day on his death day, October 3.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Papal name===
On 14 March 2013, upon his [[Papal conclave, 2013|election]] as Pope,  Archbishop and [[College of Cardinals|Cardinal]] Jorge Mario Bergoglio of [[Argentina]] chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, becoming [[Pope Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/speeches/2013/march/documents/papa-francesco_20130316_rappresentanti-media_en.html |title=Audience to Representatives of the Communications Media |author=[[Pope Francis]] |date=March 16, 2013 |accessdate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patronage===

Informally, [[Ordnance disposal]] also consider St. Francis a patron saint, since if the person is killed by an explosion, there is frequently little left of the body but strips of flesh that are later devoured by birds.

===Protestantism===
{{main article|Franciscan spirituality in Protestantism}}
Even in [[Protestantism]], the name and legacy of Saint Francis have endured.

==Main writings==
* ''Canticum Fratris Solis'' or ''Laudes Creaturarum''; [[Canticle of the Sun]].
* Prayer before the Crucifix, 1205 (extant in the original Umbrian dialect as well as in a contemporary Latin translation);
* ''Regula non bullata'', the Earlier Rule, 1221;
* ''Regula bullata'', the Later Rule, 1223;
* ''Testament'', 1226;
* ''Admonitions''.

Saint Francis is considered the first Italian poet by literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter=2 ‚Äì Poetry.

The anonymous 20th-century prayer "[[Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace]]" is widely but erroneously attributed to Saint Francis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Renoux |first=Christian |title=La pri√®re pour la paix attribu√©e √† saint Fran√ßois: une √©nigme √† r√©soudre |location=Paris |publisher=Editions franciscaines |year=2001 |isbn=2-85020-096-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.franciscan-archive.org/franciscana/peace.html |last=Renoux |first=Christian |title=The Origin of the Peace Prayer of St. Francis |accessdate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
The Franciscan Order promoted devotion to the life of Saint Francis from his canonization onwards, and commissioned large numbers of works for Franciscan churches, either showing Saint Francis with sacred figures, or episodes from his life. There are large early [[fresco]] cycles in the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi]], parts of which are shown above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3985">'''Friedrich Bernhard Marby''' (10 May  1882 &amp;ndash; 3 December 1966) was a German [[Ariosophy|rune occultist]] and Germanic [[Germanic revivalism|revivalist]]. He is best known for his revivalism and use of the [[Armanen runes]] row. Marby was imprisoned during the [[Third Reich]], which may have been due to a denunciation by [[Karl Maria Wiligut]]. According to the [[Odinist]] magazine ''[[Vor Tr√∫]]'', Marby "was one of the most (if not the most) important figures in the realm of runic sciences" with an impact felt not only by contemporaries but "among today's researchers and practitioners."&lt;ref name=Vor&gt;''[[Vor Tr√∫]]'', issue 69.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=November 2012}}

==Early life==
Born in [[Aurich]], [[Ostfriesland]], Friedrich Marby trained as a printer and served professionally as an editor.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodrick-Clarke|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|title=Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZzWRz9x8mwC&amp;pg=PA161|accessdate=26 April 2011|date=September 1993|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-3060-7|pages=161‚Äì162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rune scholarship==
From 1924, he began publishing his theories and research.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1993"/&gt;

There was a school of rune scholars who interpreted [[the Eddas]] completely in anti-Semitic fashion, but [[Alan Baker (historian)|Alan Baker]] in his book ''[[Invisible Eagle]]'' singles out Marby as one of the exceptions.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Alan|title=Invisible eagle: the Hidden History of Nazi Occultism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zupdAAAACAAJ|publisher=Virgin|isbn=978-1-85227-863-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}

Marby, along with [[Siegfried Adolf Kummer]], was criticized by name in a report made to [[Heinrich Himmler]] by his chief esoteric runologist, [[Karl Maria Wiligut]]. [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] states that Wiligut censured them "for bringing the holy Aryan heritage into disrepute and ridicule", suggesting "this criticism may have led to Marby's harsh treatment in the Third Reich."&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1993"/&gt;

According to ''Vor Tr√∫'', Marby spent eight years and three months in the camps at [[Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp|Flossenb√ºrg]], [[Welzheim]], and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] before being released on 29 April 1945.&lt;ref name=Vor/&gt;{{full|date=November 2012}} He resumed publishing his magazine ''Forschung and Erfahung'' (''Research and Experience'') and books. He died in 1966.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1993"/&gt;

Marby's "runic gymnastics" (''{{Interlanguage link multi|Runengymnastik|de}}'') was advocated as "Rune-Yoga" (also "Runic Yoga", "Stadhagaldr") by [[Stephen Flowers|Stephen Flowers ("Edred Thorsson")]] from the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Edred Thorsson, ''Futhark: A Handbook of Rune Magic'', Weiser Books, 1984, p. 15. Edred Thorsson, ''Rune might: secret practices of the German rune magicians'', Llewellyn's Teutonic magick series, 1989. Edred Thorsson, ''The Truth About Teutonic Magick'', Llewellyn's vanguard series, 1994. Later also: L. E. Camp, ''A Handbook of Armanen Runic-Wisdom: History, World-View, Rune-Yoga, Divination, the Sidereal Pendulum and the Runic-Zodiac'', 2005.
Criticized by Sweyn Plowright, ''The Rune Primer'', 2006 (esp. pp. 137-139).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4736">'''Gospel magic''' is  the use of otherwise standard stage [[magic (illusion)|magic]] tricks and [[illusion]]s to promote Christian messages.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jules L. (1976) p.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; Gospel magic does not claim to invoke spirits or paranormal powers. Gospel magic is intended to present the Christian [[Good news (Christianity)|good news]] through "visual [[parable]]s"&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, AD (2001) p9&lt;/ref&gt;; the trick or illusion is used to present theological points in an entertaining way with the intention that people will remember the message.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, G and Anderson K. (2007) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Gospel magic is generally presented as [[stage magic]] or [[platform magic]], but it can be adapted to [[close-up magic]] or [[micromagic]] situations.

== History ==
The first modern use of Gospel magic is in the ministry of the Italian Catholic priest Giovanni Melchiorre Bosco ([[Don Bosco]], 1815-1888). His autobiography lists many dozens of magic tricks used for the purpose of offering religious instruction to children and youth.
Don Bosco has been seen as the Patron Saint of Catholic Magicians and, specifically, Catholic Gospel Magicians.&lt;ref&gt;Magicians Want Don Bosco Declared Their Patron, Zenit News Agency, 29. January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, C. H. Woolston published ''Seeing Truth: Object Lessons with Magical and Mechanical Effects'' which aimed to help adults working with children in church. Other texts were soon written that incorporated Gospel messages with magic.

In 1953, the [[International Fellowship of Christian Magicians]] began in the USA. This rapidly spread the use of the creative arts to teach the Gospel. Many Gospel Performers, dealers and authors made their first attempts at magic under their tuition. There are now chapters in many US and Canadian cities as well as in the UK, Germany and Hong Kong. An International magazine is published ''The Voice of the FCM ''every two months. Annual Conventions are held in USA, UK and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcm.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Bible ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
The word "magic" never appears in the Bible. Daniel is called the "chief of the magicians" or  "master of the magicians." Daniel 4:9 The Bible condemns sorcery, astrology, speaking to spirits and witchcraft, but never does it condemn "magic."

=== The arts and ministry ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
The [[arts]] have long been used to present Christian teachings. [[Icons]], [[parables]], [[music]], [[song]], [[dance]], [[poetry]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[stained glass]], [[theater]], [[radio]], [[film]], [[television]], the [[Internet]], [[stage magic]] and illusion have all been used. Today this often includes story-telling, drama, puppetry, [[ventriloquism]], balloon-modelling and juggling.

'''High priest''' ({{lang-he-n|◊õ◊î◊ü ◊í◊ì◊ï◊ú}} ''[[kohen]] gadol''; with definite article {{Hebrew|◊î÷∑◊õ÷π÷º◊î÷µ◊ü ◊î÷∑◊í÷∏÷º◊ì◊ï÷π◊ú}} ''ha'kohen ha'gadol'', ''the'' high priest; [[Aramaic]] ''kahana rabba'')&lt;ref name=Morg&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Chapter in the History of the High-Priesthood (Concluded) |author=Julian Morgenstern |journal=The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures |date=October 1938 |volume=55 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |pages=360‚Äì377 |number=4 |jstor=3088118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the title of the chief religious official of [[Judaism]] from the early post-[[Babylonian captivity|Exilic]] times until the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem in 70 CE. Previously, in the [[Israelite]] religion including the time of the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], other terms were used to designate the leading priests; however, as long as a king was in place, the supreme ecclesiastical authority lay with him.&lt;ref name=Morg/&gt; The official introduction of the term "high priest" went hand in hand with a greatly enhanced ritual and political significance bestowed upon the chief priest in the post-Exilic period, certainly from 411 BCE onward, after the religious transformations brought about by the Babylonian captivity and due to the lack of a Jewish king and kingdom.&lt;ref name=Morg/&gt;

The high priests belonged to the [[Kohen|Jewish priestly]] families that trace their paternal line back to [[Aaron]], the first high priest of Israel in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and elder brother of [[Moses]], through [[Zadok]], a leading priest at the time of [[David]] and [[Solomon]]. This tradition came to an end in the 2nd century BCE during the rule of the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmoneans]], when the position was occupied by other priestly families unrelated to Zadok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0021_0_21361.html|title=Zadok|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predecessors of Aaron==
Even though Aaron was the first high priest mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]], the legendary passage revealed the first man assumed the title of high priest of God is [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] who was succeeded by [[Methuselah]], [[Lamech (father of Noah)|Lamech]], [[Noah]], [[Shem]] (or [[Melchizedek]]), [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Levi]].&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[[Legends of the Jews|The Legends of the Jews]] [http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf Volume I - II]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical narrative==
[[Image:PLATE4DX.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jewish high priest and [[Levite]] in [[ancient Judah]] (the depictions of the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], [[Table of Showbread]] and [[trumpet]]s are inspired by the [[Arch of Titus]]).]]
[[Aaron]], though he is but rarely called "the great priest", being generally simply designated as "''ha-kohen''" (the priest), was the first incumbent of the office, to which he was appointed by [[God]] ([[Book of Exodus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|28:1‚Äì2|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|29:4‚Äì5|HE}}).

==Succession==
The [[Order of succession|succession]] was to be through one of his sons, and was to remain in his own family ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|6:15|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' xx. 10, ¬ß 1.&lt;/ref&gt; If he had no son, the office devolved upon the brother next of age: such appears to have been the practise in the [[Hasmonean]] period. In the time of [[Eli (Judges)|Eli]], however ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|2:23|HE}}), the office passed to the collateral branch of [[Ithamar]] (see [[Eleazar]]). But [[King Solomon]] is reported to have [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] the high priest [[Abiathar]], and to have appointed [[Zadok (High Priest)|Zadok]], a descendant of Eleazar, in his stead ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|2:35|HE}}; {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|24:2‚Äì3|HE}}). After the [[Jewish Diaspora|Exile]], the succession seems to have been, at first, in a direct line from father to son; but later the civil authorities arrogated to themselves the right of appointment. [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] for instance, deposed [[Onias III]] in favor of [[Jason (High Priest)|Jason]], who was followed by [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, "Ant." xii. 5, ¬ß 1; [[II Maccabees]] iii. 4, iv. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herod the Great]] nominated no less than six high priests; [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]], two. The Roman legate [[Quirinius]] and his successors exercised the right of appointment, as did [[Agrippa I]], [[Herod of Chalcis]], and [[Agrippa II]]. Even the people occasionally elected candidates to the office. The high priests before the Exile were, it seems, appointed for life;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Numbers 35:25, 28; Joshua 20:6.&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, from Aaron to the Captivity the number of the high priests was not greater than during the sixty years preceding the fall of the [[Second Temple]].

==Age and qualifications==
The age of eligibility for the office is not fixed in the [[Torah|Law]]; but according to rabbinical tradition it was twenty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], "Yad", Kele ha-Mikdash, v. 15; ·∏§ul. 24b; 'Ar. 13b.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristobulus III of Israel|Aristobulus]], however, was only seventeen when appointed by Herod;&lt;ref&gt;"Ant." xv. 3, ¬ß 3.&lt;/ref&gt; but the son of [[Onias III]] was too young (ŒΩŒ∑œÄŒπŒøœÇ) to succeed his father.&lt;ref&gt;ib. xii. 5, ¬ß 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
The age a Levite entered the priesthood was 30 years of age ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 4:3,30).

Legitimacy of birth was essential; hence the care in the keeping of the [[genealogical]] records&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Contra Apion]]'' i., ¬ß 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the distrust of one whose mother had been captured in war.&lt;ref&gt;"Ant." xiii. 10, ¬ß 5; [[Adolf Jellinek]], "B. H." i. 133-137; ·∏≤id. 66a; John see Hyrcanus.&lt;/ref&gt; The high priest had to abstain from [[Tumah and taharah|ritual defilement]]. He may marry only an [[Israelite]] virgin ({{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|21:13‚Äì14|HE}}). In {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|44:22|HE}} this restriction is extended to all [[kohanim]] (priests), an exception being made in favor of the [[widow]] of a priest (see [[Levirate marriage]]). According to {{bibleverse||Leviticus|21:11|HE}} He was not permitted to come in contact with the bodies of the dead, not even for his parents (regular priests could become unclean for the death of an immediate relative) {{bibleverse||Leviticus|21:1-3|HE}} ; and he was not permitted, as a sign of mourning, to leave his hair disheveled, to expose it, or to rend his garments ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|21:10|HE}} et seq.). According to Josephus,&lt;ref&gt;"Ant." xv. 3, ¬ß 1.&lt;/ref&gt; birth on foreign soil was not a disqualification; but the disqualifications of {{bibleverse||Leviticus|21:17|HE}} et seq. applied to the high priest as well as to other priests.

==Vestments==
{{See also|Biblical clothing}}
&lt;!--[[Image:LEV 8- High priest in robes and breastplate.jpg|thumb|The high priest in his golden garments (the chain [[censer]] depicted is anachronistic).]]
[[Image:Kohenbreastplate.jpg|thumb|The [[priestly breastplate]] of the high priest.]]--&gt;

The [[Torah]] provides for specific vestments to be worn by the priests when they are ministering in the [[Tabernacle]]: "And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for dignity and for beauty" ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:2|HE}}).  These garments are described in detail in {{bibleverse||Exodus|28|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|39|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Leviticus|8|HE}}. The high priest wore eight holy garments (''bigdei kodesh''). Of these, four were of the same type worn by all priests, and four were unique to the Kohen Gadol.

Those vestments which were common to all priests, were:
* [[Priestly undergarments]] (Hebrew ''michnasayim'') (breeches): [[linen]] pants reaching from the waist to the knees "to cover their nakedness" ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:42|HE}})
* [[Priestly tunic]] (Hebrew ''ketonet'') ([[tunic]]): made of pure linen, covering the entire body from the neck to the feet, with sleeves reaching to the wrists. That of the high priest was embroidered ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:39|HE}}); those of the priests were plain ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:40|HE}}).
* [[Priestly sash]] (Hebrew ''avnet'') (sash): that of the high priest was of fine linen with "[[embroidery|embroidered work]]" in blue and purple and scarlet ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:39|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|39:29|HE}}); those worn by the priests were of white, twined linen.
* [[Priestly turban]] (Hebrew ''mitznefet''): that of the high priest was much larger than that of the priests and wound so that it formed a broad, flat-topped turban; that for priests was wound so that it formed a cone-shaped turban, called a ''migbahat''.

The vestments that were unique to the high priest were:
* [[Priestly robe (Judaism)|Priestly robe]] (''me'il'') ("robe of the ephod"): a sleeveless, blue robe, the lower hem of which was fringed with small golden bells alternating with [[pomegranate]]-shaped tassels in blue, purple, and scarlet‚Äî[[tekhelet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tekhelet.com|title=Ptil Tekhelet Foundation|work=Ptil Tekhelet Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; argaman, tolaat shani.
* [[Ephod]]: a richly embroidered vest or apron with two [[onyx]] [[engraved gem]]stones on the shoulders, on which were engraved the names of the tribes of Israel
* [[Priestly breastplate]] (Hebrew ''hoshen''): with twelve gems, each engraved with the name of one of the tribes; a pouch in which he probably carried the [[Urim and Thummim]]. It was fastened to the Ephod
* On the front of the turban was a [[tzitz|golden plate]] inscribed with the words: "Holiness unto [[YHWH]]" attached to the mitznefet.

The high priest, like all priests, would minister barefoot when he was serving in the Temple. Like all of the priests, he had to immerse himself in the [[mikvah|ritual bath]] before vesting and wash his hands and his feet before performing any sacred act. The [[Talmud]] teaches that neither the kohanim nor the Kohen Gadol were fit to minister unless they wore their priestly vestments: "While they are clothed in the priestly garments, they are clothed in the priesthood; but when they are not wearing the garments, the priesthood is not upon them" (B.Zevachim 17:B). It is further taught that just as the [[korbanot|sacrifices]] facilitate an [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]] for [[sin]], so do the priestly garments (B.Zevachim 88b). The high priest had two sets of holy garments: the "golden garments" detailed above, and a set of white "linen garments" (''bigdei ha-bad'') which he wore only on [[Yom Kippur|the Day of Atonement]] (Yom Kippur) ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:4|HE}}).  On that day, he would change his holy garments four times, beginning in the golden garments but changing into the Linen Garments for the two moments when he would enter the [[Holy of Holies]] (the first time to offer the blood of atonement and the incense, and the second time to retrieve the censer), and then change back again into the golden garments{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} after each time.  He would immerse in the ritual bath before each change of garments, washing his hands and his feet after removing the garments and again before putting the other set on. The linen garments were only four in number, those corresponding to the garments worn by all priests (undergarments, tunic, sash and turban), but made only of white linen, with no embroidery. They could be worn only once, new sets being made each year.

==Consecration==
The ceremonial of consecration, extending through an entire week ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28|HE}}-{{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|29|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Leviticus|8|HE}}), included certain rites which all priests were required to undergo: purification; the [[Korban|sacrifices]]; the "filling" of the hands; the smearing with blood. But Aaron the high priest was anointed with [[holy anointing oil|sacred oil]], hence the title of the "anointed priest"; other passages have it that all priests were anointed ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:41|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|30:30|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Leviticus|7:36|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|10:7|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Numbers|3:3|HE}}).

The first consecration was performed by Moses; the Bible does not state who consecrated subsequent high priests. {{bibleverse||Leviticus|21:10|HE}} states emphatically that every new high priest shall be anointed; and {{bibleverse||Exodus|29:29|HE}} et seq. commands that the official garments worn by his predecessor shall be worn by the new incumbent while he is anointed and during the seven days of his consecration (comp. {{bibleverse||Numbers|20:28|HE}}; [[Psalm 133]]:2).

==Sanctity and functions==
The distinguished rank of the high priest is apparent from the fact that his sins are regarded as belonging also to the people (Lev. iv. 3, 22). He was entrusted with the stewardship of the Urim and Thummim (Num. xxvii. 20 et seq.). On [[Yom Kippur]] he alone entered the [[Holy of Holies]], to make atonement for his house and for the people (Lev. xvi). He alone could offer the sacrifices for the sins of the priests, or of the people, or of himself (Lev. iv.); and only he could officiate at the sacrifices following his own or another priest's consecration (Lev. ix.). He also offered a meal- offering every morning and evening for himself and the whole body of the priesthood (Lev. vi. 14-15, though the wording of the law is not altogether definite). Other information concerning his functions is not given. Though other priests would serve only when it was their week on rotation and on feast days (and even then their function was decided by lot), he was privileged to take part at his own pleasure in any of the priestly rites at any time. [[Josephus]] contends that the high priest almost invariably participated in the ceremonies on [[Shabbat]], the [[Rosh Chodesh|New Moon]], and the [[Shalosh regalim|festivals]].&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus, ''[[Wars of the Jews]]'' v. 5, ¬ß 7&lt;/ref&gt; This may also be inferred from the glowing description given in the [[Wisdom of Sirach]] i. of the high priest's appearance at the [[altar]].

==In rabbinical literature==
The high priest is the chief of all the priests; he should be anointed and invested with the pontifical garments; but if the sacred oil is not obtainable,&lt;ref&gt;see Hor. 13a; "Semag", 173, end&lt;/ref&gt; investiture with the additional garments (see [[Kohen Gadol#Biblical data|Biblical Data]], above) is regarded as sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, "Yad", Kele ha-Mi·∏≥dash, iv. 12&lt;/ref&gt; A high priest so invested is known as ''merubbeh begadim.'' This investiture consists of arraying him in the eight pieces of dress and in removing them again on eight successive days, though (the anointing and) the investiture on the first day suffices to qualify him for the functions of the office.&lt;ref&gt;ib. iv. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The only distinction between the "anointed" and the "invested" high priest is that the former offers the bull for an unintentional transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Hor. 11b&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers==
The Great [[Sanhedrin]] alone had the right to appoint, or confirm the appointment of, the high priest. His consecration might take place only in the day-time. Two high priests must not be appointed together. Every high priest had a "mishneh" (a second) called the [[Segan]], or "[[memunneh]]", to stand at his right; another assistant was the "[[Catholicos]]" ("Yad", l.c. 16‚Äì17). The right of succession was in the direct, or, the direct failing, the collateral, line, provided the conditions concerning physical fitness were fulfilled (ib. 20; Ket. 103b; Sifra, ·∏≤edoshim).

For offenses which entailed flagellation the high priest could be sentenced by a court of three; after submitting to the penalty he could resume his office ("Yad", l.c. 22). The high priest was expected to be superior to all other priests in physique, in wisdom, in dignity, and in material wealth; if he was poor his brother priests contributed to make him rich (Yoma 18a; "Yad", l.c. v. 1); but none of these conditions was indispensable.

The high priest was required to be mindful of his honor. He might not mingle with the common people, nor permit himself to be seen disrobed, or in a public bath, etc.; but he might invite others to bathe with him (Tosef., Sanh. iv.; "Yad", l.c. v. 3). He might not participate in a public banquet, but he might pay a visit of consolation to mourners, though even then his dignity was guarded by prescribed etiquette (Sanh. 18‚Äì19; "Yad", l.c. v. 4).

==Restrictions==
The high priest might not follow the bier of one in his own family who had died, nor leave the Temple or his house during the time of mourning. The people visited him to offer consolation; in receiving them, the [[Segan]] was at his right, the next in rank and the people at his left. The people said: "We are thy atonement." He answered: "Be ye blessed from heaven" ("Yad", l.c. v. 5; and Mishneh Kesef, ad loc.). During the offering of consolation he sat on a stool, the people on the floor; he rent his garments, not from above, but from below, near the feet, the penalty for rending them from above being flagellation (Semag, Lawin, 61-62). He could not permit his hair to be disheveled, nor could he cut it ("Yad", l.c. v. 6). He had one house attached to the Temple (Mid. 71b), and another in the city of Jerusalem. His honor required that he should spend most of his time in the Sanctuary ("Yad", l.c. v. 7). The high priest was subject to the jurisdiction of the courts, but if accused of a crime entailing capital punishment he was tried by the Great Sanhedrin; he could, however, refuse to give testimony (Sanh. 18).

The high priest must be married, and "should only marry a virgin"; to guard against contingencies it was proposed to hold a second wife in readiness immediately before the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]] (Yoma i. 1); but [[polygamy]] on his part was not encouraged ( = "one wife"; Yoma 13a; "Yad", l.c. v. 10). He could give the "[[halizah]]", and it could be given to his widow, as she also was subject to the Levirate; his divorced wife could marry again (l.c.; Sanh. 18). When entering the Temple ("Hekal") he was supported to the curtain by three men (Tamid 67a; this may perhaps have reference to his entering the Holy of Holies; but see "Yad", l.c. v. 11, and the Mishneh Kesef ad loc.). He could take part in the service whenever he desired ("Yad", l.c. v. 12; Yoma i. 2; Tamid 67b; see Rashi ad loc.). On the Day of Atonement only he wore white garments, while on other occasions he wore his golden vestments (Yoma 60a; comp. 68b, ). The seven days preceding the Day of Atonement were devoted to preparing for his high function, precautions being taken to prevent any accident that might render him Levitically impure (Yoma i. 1 et seq.). The ceremonial for that day is described in detail in Mishnah Yoma (see also [[Haneberg]], "Die Religi√∂sen Alterth√ºmer der Bibel", pp.&amp;nbsp;659‚Äì671, Munich, 1869). For other regulations concerning the high priest see "Yad", Biat ha-Mi·∏≥dash, ii. 1, 8; for details in regard to the vestments see "Yad", Kele ha-Mi·∏≥dash, viii. 2-4, 5 (in reference to soiled vestments: the white could be worn only once); l.c. vii. 1 ("·∫ìi·∫ì"), vii. 3 ("me'il"), vii. 6 ("·∏•oshen"), vii. 9 (ephod), ix.

Josephus enumerates only fifty-two pontificates under the Second Temple, omitting the second appointments of [[Hyrcanus II]], [[Hananeel]], and [[Joazar]].

==Post-Exilic conditions==
[[Image:Kohanim.jpg|thumb|A traditional list of the Jewish high priests.]]

After the [[Babylonian Exile]], Joshua appears vested with the prominence that the [[Priestly source]] (P) ascribes to the high priest (Zech. iii.; Hag. vi. 13).  The post-exilic high priests traced their pedigree back to Zadok, appointed as chief priest at Jerusalem by Solomon (I Kings ii. 35), and Zadok was held to be a descendant of Eleazar, the son of Aaron (II Chron. v. 34). Immediately after the return from the Captivity, as is clearly to be inferred from [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] and [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]], political authority was not vested in the high priest. Political (Messianic) sovereignty was represented by, or attributed to, a member of the royal house, while religious affairs were reserved to the high-priesthood, represented in the Book of Zechariah by Joshua. But in the course of time, as the [[Jewish messianism|Messianic]] hope, or even the hope of autonomy under foreign ([[Persia]]n, [[Greece|Greek]], [[Egypt]]ian,or [[Seleucid|Syria]]n) suzerainty became weaker, the high priest also became a political chief of the congregation, as much, perhaps, through the consideration shown him by the suzerain powers and their viceroys as through the effect of the increasingly thorough acceptance of the Levitical code by pious [[Judea]]ns. The rigorists received [[Alcimus]], the high priest, with confidence because he was "a priest of the seed of Aaron." (I Macc. vii. 14)

==Political aspects==
The assumption of the princely authority by the [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] high priests (the Hasmoneans) was merely the final link in this development, which, beginning with the death of [[Zerubbabel]], was to combine the two ideals, the [[Messiah|politico-Messianic]] and the religio-Levitical, in one office. But after the brief heyday of national independence had come to an inglorious close, the high-priesthood changed again in character, insofar as it ceased to be a hereditary and a life office. High priests were appointed and removed with great frequency (see above). This may account for the otherwise strange use of the title in the plural (·ºÄœÅœáŒπŒµœÅŒµ·øñœÇ) in the New Testament and in Josephus ("Vita", ¬ß 38; "B. J." ii. 12, ¬ß 6; iv. 3, ¬ß¬ß 7, 9; iv. 4, ¬ß 3). The deposed high priests seem to have retained the title, and to have continued to exercise certain functions; the ministration on the Day of Atonement, however, may have been reserved for the actual incumbent. This, however, is not clear; Hor. iii. 1‚Äì4 mentions as distinctive the exclusive sacrifice of a bull by the high priest on the Day of Atonement and the tenth of the ephah (that is, the twelve "·∏•allot"; comp. Meg. i. 9; Macc. ii. 6). But even in the latest periods the office was restricted to a few families of great distinction (probably the ''bene kohanim gedolim'', "[members of] high-priestly families"; Ket. xiii. 1-2; Oh. xvii. 5; comp. Josephus, "B. J." vi. 2, ¬ß 2; see Sch√ºrer, "Gesch." 3d ed., ii. 222). 001

==Connection with Sanhedrin==
The high priest was the presiding officer of the Sanhedrin. This view conflicts with the later Jewish tradition according to which the [[Pharisee]] ''[[tannaim]]'' (the ''[[Zugot]]'') at the head of the ''[[yeshivot]]'' presided over the great Sanhedrin also (·∏§ag. ii. 2). However, a careful reading of the sources ("Ant." xx. 10; "Contra Ap." ii., ¬ß 22; comp. "Ant." iv. 8, ¬ß 14; xiv. 9, ¬ß¬ß 3‚Äì5 [Hyrcanus II. as president]; xx. 9, ¬ß 1 [Ananus]), as well as the fact that in the post-Maccabean period the high priest was looked upon as exercising in all things, political, legal, and sacerdotal, the supreme authority, shows it to be almost certain that the presidency of the Sanhedrin was vested in the high priest (see Isidore Loeb in "R. E. J." 1889, xix. 188‚Äì201; Jelski, "Die Innere Einrichtung des Grossen Synhedrions", pp.&amp;nbsp;22‚Äì28, according to whom the ''[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]'' was the high priest, while the ''[[Beth din#Officers of a beth din|Av Beth Din]]'' was a Pharisaic ''tanna'').

==In Christianity==
{{Main|Melchizedek priesthood#In Christianity}}
In [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, [[Jesus]] is symbolically consecrated as eternal high priest "after the order of [[Melchizedek]]" ({{bibleref|Hebrews|6:20|9}}) in light of his eternal intercession with God. The position of high priest of Israel was abolished with the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, so Jesus' assumption of the title of high priest served as a symbolic continuation of the priesthood. Melchizedek is never identified explicitly as a "high priest" (◊õ◊î◊ü ◊í◊ì◊ï◊ú) in the Hebrew Bible, but a "priest of the most high God" (◊õ◊î◊ü ◊ú◊ê◊ú ◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ï◊ü, {{bibleref|Genesis|14:18|9}}); the Aaronic high priesthood had not yet been established ([[Aaron]] is also never explicitly identified as "high priest"). Jesus is nevertheless identified in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] as a "high priest (·ºÄœÅœáŒπŒµœÅŒµœçœÇ) after the order of Melchizedek." The use of Melchizedek as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of Christ is significant because Melchizedek was ordained a priest despite not being related to [[Aaron]]. As Jesus was not a descendant of Aaron, he would not normally have been eligible to serve as high priest; the "order of Melchizedek" emphasizes the precedent for his claim to priesthood.

'''Ecuadorian Jews''' are a small [[Jewish]] community in the territory of today's [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Ecuador.html |title=Jews in Ecuador |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They form one of the smallest Jewish communities in [[South America]].

==History==

=== Early years ===
In 1580 occurs in the Iberian peninsula union of the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, and King [[Philip II of Spain]] is the only heir to the throne of that kingdom. Many Portuguese "suspicious of their faith" begin to enter the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] by the newly founded city in which surveillance Inquisition was weaker. The first Jews start arriving in Ecuador in the 16th and 17th centuries. Then union of the kingdoms lasts until 1640, when the Portuguese revolt against the Spanish monarchy and the Duke of Braganza, under the name of John IV, took the throne of the kingdom of Portugal. But they were sixty years during which Spanish America was under one crown, and for them, a large number of Christians grew from new Portuguese to the Spanish dominions domains. So to say that someone was "Portuguese" was synonymous with "converted Jew".

The inquisitorial actions achieved the effect of terrorizing the families of new Christians and encourage them to migrate to other regions of the Peruvian viceroyalty and preferably to those where there were no courts of the Inquisition. Luckily, the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] was extremely large and there were still large territorial areas in which the Inquisition was not present, so persecuted fugitives or symbol (heretics, Judaizing, dogmatists, bigamous and etc.) could relatively easily be hidden away from the major urban centers and especially camouflaging to hide his true personal and group identity.

It was so "new Christians" settled in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] migrated from its center to the less populated and controlled outdoor areas, particularly towards the southern and northern Chile Audience of Quito . Regarding those who marched to Quito, the new diaspora took first to the Interior Juan Salinas and Loyola (later transformed into the township of [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]]), which, according to studies by Ricardo Ordo√±ez Chiriboga,&lt;ref&gt;[http://esefarad.com/?p=41018  Studies by Ricardo Ordo√±ez Chiriboga]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/La_herencia_sefardita_en_la_provincia_de.html  La herencia Sefardita en la provincia de Loja by Ricardo Ordo√±ez Chiriboga]&lt;/ref&gt; was an important center of filing [[Sephardim]]. Subsequently, many of these families migrated further north to the next judges of [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]], and then to the northernmost township of Chimborazo (Alaus√≠, Pallatanga and Chimborazo), always looking away from the powerful and cruel inquisitorial arm. Early Sephardic Jews probably arrived in Cuenca and its nearby settlements between the late sixteenth century and early seventeenth, but seem to have been new waves of Jewish migration to the area in later times. But we can not deny the possibility that other Sephardim, had been established in the colonial territory since the early days of the Spanish conquest, as they seem to show the names of conquerors arrived with Benalc√°zar Sebastian and Pedro de Alvarado . In the seventeenth century appear new landowners of these are uncertain origin with surnames Saavedra, Hadaad and Iglesias that encamped in the council of Cuenca. They also reached the northern Peruvian Andes, due to cultural and ethnic influences of the place was not defined by colonial boundaries, much less what it is today; this cultural-historical unit comes even from pre-Columbian times.

All aforementioned largely explains the [[Sephardic]] presence in gold and commercial areas of [[Quito]] and [[Calacal√≠]] such as [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neapolitan.com/ecuador/journal3.html Ecuador Journal by Dr. barry Reder ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zaruma]],  [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]], Santa Isabel, Yungilla, Tarqu√≠, [[Chordeleg]] and S√≠gsig, and mountain passes or centers of trade routes between Guayaquil and Quito, as Alaus√≠ Chapacoto, Chimborazo St. Joseph, San Miguel de Chimborazo and Guaranda and in the northern highlands of [[Peru]], due to its proximity. This presence of [[Western Sephardim]] Jews remained hidden for years in Ecuador and also settled in villages so remote sites as the Judaism practiced only in secret at home. Most of these [[Crypto-Jews]] still speak  [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishmiami.org/communitypost/happening/37842/from_oy_to_joy_at_miami_jewish_film_festival The Lost Sephardic Tribes of Latin America]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/elrostro.deunapresencia/info El Rostro de una Presencia ]&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that [[Antonio Jos√© de Sucre]], a leader in the struggle for independence in South America, and the hero of Ecuador, who served both as president of Peru (short term) and as president of Bolivia, is a descendant of those Jews.&lt;ref&gt;http://travelingrabbi.com/countries/south-america/ecuador&lt;/ref&gt; Certain family names among established Ecuadorian families attest to their [[Sephardi]] ancestry and [[Crypto-Jews]]; however, prior to World War II there was very little active Jewish immigration to Ecuador.

=== 20th Century ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}} 

In 1904 there were only four Jewish families in the country, and a survey in 1917 indicated the presence of 14 Jews.&lt;ref name="bh.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/ecuador|title=The Jewish Community of Ecuador|publisher=[[The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot]]|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1924, when the United States established its immigration quota system, a handful more arrived in Ecuador. Yet, only in the wake of the rise of Nazism and the ensuing Holocaust in Europe did the Jewish mass immigration to Ecuador began. During the years 1933-43 about 2,700 Jews arrived, and by 1945 there were 3,000 new Jewish immigrants, 85% of whom were refugees from Europe.

In the early years of World War II, Ecuador still admitted a certain number of immigrants, and in 1939, when several South American countries refused to accept the 165 Jewish refugees from Germany aboard the ship "Koenigstein," Ecuador granted them entry permits. Nevertheless, the country eventually gave way to a policy of selectivity. Jewish immigration to Ecuador were supposed to be employed in the agricultural realm, but the authorities soon surmised that the immigrants were actually merchants, industrialists, and businessmen, and were not farming. As a result, in 1938 legislation was passed compelling any Jew not engaged in agriculture or industry to leave the country. In addition, entry rights were limited to those Jews who possessed a minimum of $400, which they would have to invest in an industrial project.

In 1935 the Comite pour l'Etude de l'Industrie de l'Immigration dans la Republique de l'Equateur was established in Paris by the organization, the Freeland League of Jewish Colonization, with the purpose of creating a settlement program in Ecuador. An agreement was reached with the Ecuadorian government to transfer 500,000 acres of land to the Committee's jurisdiction for a period of 30 years to be settled by immigrants regardless of race, religion, or nationality. Several concessions were also promised, such as tax exemption for three years, citizenship after one year, customs exemption, and free transportation by train from the port to the interior of the country. The president signed the agreement several months later on the condition that a detailed program be presented by May 1937 and that the Committee invest $8,000 and settle at least 100 families. Some Jewish organizations, however, found the land proposed for the plan unacceptable, claiming that it was too far from population centers and that the climate was too severe. The result of these objections was the total abandonment of the project.

Following this attempt, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and HICEM attempted to establish chicken farms for the immigrants in other areas of Ecuador, and 60 families were settled, but conditions precluded any success in the venture, which ultimately failed. Most of the immigrants were businessmen and professionals who preferred to carry on their professions. Many discovered that the native balsa wood was excellent for furniture craft and began production. Later, these immigrants introduced iron and steel furniture to the Ecuadorian market, previously unknown to the country. They also developed retail stores and opened hotels. The success of the immigrants, however, caused tension among the Syrian and Cuban community who had previously controlled those fields of business. This pressure led to an anti-Jewish sentiment for a while, but nothing more substantial.

In 1940 there were 3,000 Jews in Ecuador, the vast majority refugees from Germany.  Jews in Ecuador entered the press, medicine industry and commerce. They established textile factories, pharmaceutical factories and important furniture factories.

At its peak, in 1950, the Jewish population of Ecuador was estimated at 4,000 persons, the majority living in Quito, several hundred in Guayaquil, and several scores in Ambato, Riobamba, and Cuenca. In 1952, a law was passed requiring every foreigner to supply proof that he was engaged in the occupation stipulated in his entry visa. The World Jewish Congress tried to help those Jews who were practicing business, but were only supposed to be in the agricultural sector; however, attempts at agricultural settlement were unsuccessful.

Ecuador's government policies regarding Jewish emigration were historically tentative and volatile: in 1935, for example, it gave the Jews permission to settle in an area of about 20,000 square kilometers, and on the other hand, in 1938, the government issued an order that all the Jewish residents that are not working in agriculture or are not capable to develop the industry would need to leave the country.

=== Jewish community today ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}} 

The Jewish community today lives in two major cities: [[Quito]] and [[Guayaquil]]. The community is about 290 people. The Jewish community of Ecuador is predominantly of German origin, but the younger generation is Spanish-speaking. The Ecuadorian Jewish community is a homogeneous group, a fact which has facilitated great communal organization. The Asociacion de Beneficencia Israelita, founded in 1938, is the central body for religious and cultural affairs. Other organizations in the country are the Zionist Federation, B'nai B'rith, Wizo, and Maccabi. A bilingual Spanish-German bulletin, Informaciones, is published by the community. Intermarriage is not as great of a problem in Ecuador as elsewhere since Jews form a separate middle-stratum between the upper, traditionally Catholic classes, and the lower classes of the indigenous population.

There is a Jewish school in Quito, the Colegio Experimental Alberto Einstein, established in 1973, which serves both Jewish and non-Jewish students from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. All Jewish holidays are celebrated by the school, and Hebrew and other Jewish studies are taught there. The school has an excellent reputation and superb pre-college preparatory program. The Jewish community of Quito has its own building, a home for the aged, and a synagogue that holds services on the Sabbath and holidays.

Ecuador has traditionally maintained friendly relations with Israel, and has frequently supported Israel in the United Nations. The Ecuadorian Embassy is in Tel Aviv . In the late 1960s, a network of technical cooperation and assistance was developed between the two countries, especially in the fields of agriculture, and water development. Since 1948, 137 Ecuadorian Jews have emigrated to Israel.

== Prominent Ecuadorian Jews== 
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}} 

Ecuadorian Jews have achieved prominence in various fields including academics, industry, and science. Benno Weiser (Benjamin Varon), who was an active Ecuadorian journalism, later entered the Israel diplomatic service and served in various Latin American countries. His brother, Max Weiser, was the first Israel consul in Ecuador. [[Moselio Schaechter]] a researcher involved studying bacterial growth and cell division.

In the industrial field, where Jews played an especially important role, the names Rothschild and Seligmann stand out in the area of the development of metal industries, and the pharmaceutical industry is indebted to Carlos Alberti Ottolenghi and Alberto Di Capua. Paul Engel, an endocrinologist and pathologist, was a co-founder of the Endocrine Society of Ecuador.

[[File:Cross-lorraine.svg|thumb|150px|[[Two-barred cross]]es symbolise the [[tree of life]] in Hungarian Native Faith.]]
The '''Hungarian Native Faith''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''≈êsmagyar Vall√°s''), also termed '''Hungarian Neopaganism''', is a [[modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] [[new religious movement]] aimed at representing an [[ethnic religion]] of the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], inspired by [[t√°ltos|taltosism]] (Hungarian shamanism), [[Hungarian mythology|ancient mythology]] and [[shamanistic remnants in Hungarian folklore|later folklore]]. The Hungarian Native Faith movement has roots in 18th- and 19th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] elaborations, and early-20th-century ethnology.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|pp=230‚Äì231}} The construction of a national Hungarian religion was endorsed in interwar [[Hungarian Turanism|Turanist]] circles (1930s‚Äì1940s), and, eventually, Hungarian Native Faith movements blossomed in [[Hungary]] after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=36‚Äì62}}

The boundaries between Hungarian Native Faith groups are often traced along their differing ideas about the [[ethnogenesis|ethnogenetic]] origins of the Hungarians, which have historically been a matter of debate.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=66}} Many organisations acknowledge the commonly accepted theory that Hungarians originated among the [[Uralic peoples]]. Other Hungarian Native Faith groups, however, cultivate further links with [[Scythian]], [[Sumer]]ian,{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=37‚Äì38}} [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=43‚Äì47}} and other cultures.

Besides the elaborations developed within intellectual circles, the grassroots development of the Hungarian Native Faith largely relies upon the work of individual [[shaman]]s or [[neoshamanism|neoshamans]], the ''t√°ltos'', whom have become popular in Hungary since the 1980s.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=36‚Äì62}} Some Hungarian Native Faith organisations are supported by political parties of the right-wing, including [[Fidesz]] and [[Jobbik]].{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=64‚Äì65}}

==Overview and essential features==
[[File:T√°ltos (1).jpg|thumb|Ritual performed at the Temple of the Seven Images of the Mother of God.]]
===Roots of the Hungarian Native Faith===
Since the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, throughout the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and especially [[Romanticism]], the study of the ancient religion of the Hungarians has been tied together with the debate about their [[ethnogenesis]] and the nature of [[Hungarian language|their language]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kolozsi|1y=2012|1p=37|2a1=Szil√°rdi|2y=2013|2pp=230‚Äì231}} This kaleidoscopic search for the origins of the Hungarians has continued to be productive well into the twentieth century, especially as a means to build a strong national identity. According to scholars, this search was fueled by the experience of the Hungarians under foreign powers, namely the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Soviet]] dominations.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=231}} The theme of a national Hungarian religion was also dear to [[Hungarian Turanism|Hungarian Turanist]] circles in the 1930s and the 1940s, who looked for evidences to demonstrate a kinship between the [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]] and [[Turkic peoples]], and generally the origins of these "[[Turan]]ian" populations in [[Central Asia]].{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=43‚Äì47}} The Protestant priest B√©la Murak√∂zy, writing in 1921, forebode that Turanism, with its anti-Western slants and its fascination with the Orient, would have taken a religious direction trying to resurrect "ancient paganism".{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=47}} When Hungary was occupied by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces in 1945, many Turanists emigrated to Western countries and continued to work there on their ideas, to reintroduce them to Hungary starting in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=48}}

Theories about [[Scythian]] and [[Sumer]]ian origins were supported by many Turanist ethnologists.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=38}} At the turn of the twentieth century, the first to popularise the notion of a [[Turanian languages|Turanian linguistic family]] inclusive of Hungarian and Sumerian was Gyula Ferenczy.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|pp=232‚Äì234}} In the post-war period, a direct filiation of the Hungarians from the Sumerians was theorised by Tibor Bar√°th, Victor Pad√°nyi, Andr√°s Zakar,{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|pp=232‚Äì234}} and especially Ida Bobula, though the most well-known supporter of the theory is Ferenc Badinyi-J√≥s, who emigrated to Argentina, according to whom the original undivided Sumerian-Hungarian ethnicity was based on the [[Carpathian Mountains]].{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=50‚Äì52}} The theory has left a lasting influence in the Hungarian Native Faith movement, as Badinyi-J√≥s was among the first to propose the constitution of an ethnic "Hungarian Church".{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=53}} Other scholars proposed the kinship of the Hungarians with [[Hebrews]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[ancient Egypt]]ians, and others even with [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Greeks]], and other peoples.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|pp=230‚Äì231}}

Already in 1770, J√°nos Sajnovics demonstrated the relationship of Hungarian with [[Uralic languages]], with the publication of the ''Demonstratio idioma Ungarorum et Lapponum idem esse''.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=231}} In the nineteenth century, with new studies on folklore, academic circles welcomed the idea that ancient Hungarian religion was essentially [[shamanism|shamanic]], related to Uralic and [[Siberia]]n traditions. In the meantime, Arnold Ipolyi, bishop of [[Oradea]], published his monumental work ''Magyar Mythol√≥gia'' (''Hungarian Mythology''), finished in 1854, aimed at matching the [[Brothers Grimm]]'s ''Deutsche Mythologie''.{{sfnm|1a1=Kolozsi|1y=2012|1p=38|2a1=Szil√°rdi|2y=2013|2p=231}}

In the 1960s, M√°ty√°s Jen≈ë Feh√©r, another emigrant to Argentina who was a church-historian and former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], provided a seminal view for a post-Christian Hungary. From 1967, he published several books about the ''Kassai K√≥dex'' or ''Collectio Dominicana''. He claimed that in 1944 he had found in Kosice a previously unknown medieval codex with records from inquisition courts. The codex documented a centuries-long effort by the merciless Christian church to exterminate the taltoses, Hungarian shamans, the representatives of the pre-Christian Hungarian religion whose role was to preserve the integrity of the nation. Though it is considered a forgery by academic scholarship, the document is among the reference points for proponents of the Hungarian Native Faith to illustrate the high morality of the indigenous religion and of its representatives.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=52‚Äì53}}

===Taltosism===
"Taltosism" is Hungarian shamanism, practised by the ''[[t√°ltos]]'' (English plural "taltoses"{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|loc=passim}}), that is to say Hungarian shamans, and is an essential element of the Hungarian Native Faith. Hungarian chronicles of the 13th century still reported about "magicians" (taltoses) who practised their rites for the welfare of society.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=39}} Hungarian taltosism persisted until the [[World War II]] in rural areas, where certain people were still considered taltoses by the local communities, though they practiced weather-magic only.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=39}}

Ideas about an ethnic Hungarian shamanism as a defining characteristic of the Hungarian essence were studied within a [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] framework by G√©za R√≥heim in the 1920s, and later by Vilmos Di√≥szegi with field work in Siberia in the 1950s and the 1960s.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=38}} The shamanic character of the original Hungarian religion is accepted by most contemporary scholars, and has been the focus of most new studies.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=38‚Äì39}}

====Study of the taltoses====
Di√≥szegi described taltoses as specialists who are able of going through a controlled ecstasy (''rejtez√©s'').{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=40}} One becomes a taltos by heredity or vocation, and the process of becoming one includes the typical stages of psychophysical disease, acceptance and healing: After an initial resistance to vocation and the various symptoms of the "shamanic disease", the chosen by the gods finally accepts his role and is endowed with his powers.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=40}} Taltoses acquire superior knowledge at a young age‚Äîusually at seven‚Äî, through shamanic journeys taking place in days-long dreams, in which the main goal is to climb the ''[[√©gig √©r≈ë fa]]'' ("sky-high tree"), also called ''√©let fa'' ("[[tree of life]]"), ''vil√°g fa'' ("[[world tree]]") or ''tetejetlen fa'' ("tree without a top").{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=40}} Di√≥szegi considered many elements of Hungarian taltosism to be peculiar to the Hungarian ethnicity, not to be found in Central Asian shamanic traditions.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=40}} He described the role of the taltos as the "recognition and accomplishment of things required by the community, but unresolved due to the limitation of its own [the community's] powers".{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=235}}

Contemporary Hungarian religious studies, primarily the academic circle revolving around Mih√°ly Hopp√°l, has acquired an important role for the international study of shamanism.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=41}} The Hungarian ethnological discourse presents taltoses, and shamans in general, as those whose socio-religious role is to heal, prophesise, and keep the integrity of cultural traditions by connecting the past and the present and thus projecting into the future, integrating the individual and the community, mankind and the gods.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=41}} In the words of Hopp√°l, shamanism is depicted as a "bridge and symbol, because it interconnects the traditions of the past with the present, and anchors the future of traditions".{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=41}} The shaman's tasks are "leading the community, guarding the ethnic consciousness, being a (sacrificial) priest".{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=235}}

====Modern taltosism====
[[File:T√°ltos (2).jpg|thumb|A modern taltos performing a ritual with his drum, in front of a fire.]]
The modern taltos movement started in the 1980s, developing links with [[Michael Harner]] and other representatives of [[core shamanism]] from the [[United States]] since 1986.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=42}} However, there are significant differences between American [[neoshamanism]] and Hungarian modern taltosism. While the American movement aims at representing a trans-cultural technique, designed as adaptable to different cultural contexts, and focused on self-empowerment and healing application, Hungarian taltosism is first and foremost an [[ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] technique.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=42‚Äì43}} Mih√°ly Hopp√°l supported the taltos revival in his country as a means for consolidating a Hungarian Native Faith, and therefore for ethnic rejuvenation.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=41‚Äì42}}

Congregations of taltoses and their followers hold weekly ritual and healing gatherings, and they organise pilgrimages to holy sites. Rituals practised by Hungarian Native Faith practitioners include rituals of initiation and passage, and rituals for fertility, healing and purification, either for the environment, the community of believers, or the entire Hungarian nation. They may involve sweat lodges, fire-walk, drumming, and techniques of meditation.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=61}} While the ceremonies are usually led by taltoses, the community of believers is actively involved.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=61}}

Among well-known modern taltoses there are Zolt√°n Nagy S√≥lyomfi, Istv√°n Somogyi, Feh√©rholl√≥ √ñsk√º, and Andr√°s Kov√°cs-Magyar.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=61}} Other mediators of the tradition are Imr√© M√°t√©, Attila Heffner, Tam√°s Hervay, and G√°bor Szemz≈ë.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=235}} Although they belong to different organisations, they agree on the [[monotheism]] of Hungarian Native Faith's theology and on the role of the taltos. According to them, the taltos functions as "the bridge between the celestial and the earthly worlds, between the irrational and the rational, the endless and the finite". Taltoses are interpreters of the transcendent.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=235}}

According to Attila Heffner's definition:{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=235}}
{{Quote|Taltoses opened up, expanded their consciousness to this world, which is not perceivable in a normal state of the mind. During the so-called soul-journey ... they brought answers to questions, healing to diseases, seeing events of past and future, with the help of a purposive, goal-oriented action in this broader horizon of the existing world.}}

Taltoses share their knowledge acting as instructors, teaching their ideas in organised frameworks (for instance S√≥lyomfi's School of the Ancient Source or Kov√°cs' Taltos School), through lectures or in discussion circles. The techniques for getting in touch with the transcendent (''r√©v√ºl√©s'') take place through an active participation in ceremonies and rituals. Taltoses are religious specialists, and their role of healers is particularly pronounced; for instance, exercises of directed meditation, induced by drumming, to eliminate harmful thoughts, play a prominent role in their practice.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=235}}

In their responsibility for the entire nation, and their role as keepers and awakeners of the national essence, modern taltoses often claim connection with the royal [[√Årp√°d dynasty|House of √Årp√°d]]‚Äîthe first dynasty to rule Hungary‚Äîand with [[Jesus]], reinterpreted as a shamanic figure. According to Attila Heffner:{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=236}}
{{Quote|[While] the shamanic quality is characteristic of the system of universal human culture, ... the taltos is specifically the guardian and executive of the Hun, Sz√©kely and Hungarian human world and traditions. Whereas a shaman can be a member of any culture ... a taltos pronouncedly exists in accordance with the spirituality of our Hungarian culture saturated in the appreciation of Jesus.}}

===Scriptures===
Within the Hungarian Native Faith movement, two mythopoetic texts have become the bases of two concurrent streams of religious doctrine. These texts are the ''Arvisura'' written by Zolt√°n Pa√°l, and the ''Yotengrit'' four-books collection written by Imre M√°t√©.{{sfn|Hubbes|2013|p=229}} Mythopoetic themes from both the works have more recently been synthesised in other media, such as the long animated film ''Sons of Heaven'' (''Az √âg Ô¨Åai'', 2010).{{sfn|Hubbes|2013|p=226, note 10}} Another long animation influenced by Hungarian Native Faith narratives, this time based on ethnographic and historical data from the Uralic paradigm and realised with subsidy from the national government, is the ''Song of the Miraculous Hind'' (''√ânek a csodaszarvasr√≥l'', 2002).{{sfn|Hubbes|2013|pp=226‚Äì227}}

Zolt√°n Pa√°l (1913‚Äì1982) was a steelworker who, during the [[World War II|Second World War]], was initiated by a Siberian [[Mansi people|Mansi]] shaman named Tura Salavare, whom was then soldier in the [[Red Army]]. Pa√°l compiled the knowledge he acquired in the ''Arvisura'', which tells the history of the [[Huns|Hunnish]] tribes starting from a mythical prehistory, to their settling of [[Mesopotamia]] and then [[Ordos culture|Ordos]], and finally to [[Matthias Corvinus]]. The book draws elements from [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] traditions.{{sfn|Hubbes|2013|pp=229‚Äì230}}

The ''Yotengrit'' is more religious-philosophical in its message. Its author Imre M√°t√© was the taltos, or ''b√°csa'', founder of the Yotengrit Church. The work claims to represent the faithful transmission of the ancient knowledge preserved by people in the R√°bak√∂z region of western Hungary, the heritage of the so-called "B√º√ºn-religion", the persecuted original faith of the Hungarians. The work and especially the ''Prophecy of Nyirka'' which it contains, an allegorical text supposed to forebode the future of Hungary and global politics, has become a stronghold for nationalism and far-right occultism.{{sfn|Hubbes|2013|pp=230‚Äì231}}

==Hungarian Native Faith churches==
There are a variety of Hungarian Native Faith churches reflecting the movement's internal diversity. These churches differ from each other in both their doctrines and the character of their activities.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=59}} They often develop from local taltos-led communities, or are individually established by a taltos. These taltoses are considered by their followers valid spiritual leaders and while some practise only within the boundaries of their local communities, others have acquired a national reputation.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=60‚Äì61}} Their popular acknowledgement depends on attributed ritual and healing efficacy.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|pp=60‚Äì61}}

There are churches which base their doctrines on an outspoken synthesis of different traditions, and churches which claim to represent purely native traditions.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|pp=238‚Äì239}} In the first group there are the Church of Esoteric Doctrines (''Ezoterikus Tanok Egyh√°za'') or Church of the Holy Crown (''Szent Korona Egyh√°z'')‚Äîfounded in 1996 and officially registered by the Hungarian state in 1997‚Äî,{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=238}} the Church of the Universe (''Univerzum Egyh√°za'') of Gi√∂rgy P√©ter P√°l Kisfaludy, and the Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church of Andr√°s Kov√°cs.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=239}} Most of the others fall within the second category, including the Community of Hungarian Religion of Attila Kov√°cs, the Ancient Hungarian Church of L√°szl√≥ Hjad√∫ Nimr√≥d, the Yotengrit Church of Imre M√°t√©, the Firebird Taltos Drum Circle of Zolt√°n S√≥lyomfi, the People of √Årp√°d Drumming Circle of Lehel Bakonyi, and the Traditional Church of the Order of √Årp√°d.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|pp=239‚Äì244}} The most influential among them have been the Yotengrit Church and the Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=59}}

Besides these taltos-led groups there are taltoses who do not have a community and yet are regarded as the most charismatic figures of Hungarian Native Faith. They include Attila Heffner, Tam√°s Hervay the "Soul-Lifting Taltos", and J√°nos Majercsik Oguz.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=244}}

===Andr√°s Kov√°cs' Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church===
[[File:Szellemi T√°ltos Iskola gate.jpg|thumb|Gateway of the Noetic Taltos School.]]
The Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church (''≈êsmagyar T√°ltos Egyh√°z'') founded by Andr√°s Kov√°cs, a disciple of Kisfaludy, teaches a Hungarian Native Faith doctrine which it claims to be the original religion of the Huns. According to the church, God the Father is an energetic vibration which incarnated in a host, the Mother of God, begetting the Sun God (of whom Jesus is a representation).{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=239}} The [[Pilis Mountains]] are a holy place according to the Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=59}} Kov√°cs is also the founder and director of the Noetic Taltos School (''Szellemi T√°ltos Iskola'').{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=59}}

===Attila Kov√°cs' Community of the Hungarian Religion===
The Community of the Hungarian Religion (''Magyar Vall√°s K√∂z√∂ss√©ge'') inherits those scholarly studies of the nineteenth century which claimed that Hungarian and [[Sumerian language]] share an origin in the hypothetical Turanian linguistic family. Based on these ideas, in the 1930s Zolt√°n Bencsi founded the Turanian Monotheist Movement. After [[Mikl√≥s Horthy]]'s government banned the organisation, some members went abroad. Among them was √ìtto J√°nos Homonnay, who in the 1960s, in [[Canada]], established the Hungarian Turul Society to promote the Turanist theses. In 1979, after Homonnay's death, J√°nos P√°ll took over the leadership of the group.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=240}}

The Community of Hungarian Religion was founded in Hungary in 1992 as a continuation of the Turul Society. The current leader is Attila Kov√°cs, according to whom the church already had gathered around one thousand members in the late 1990s. The church is distinctively anti-Christian, and considers the adoption of Christianity by [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] in 1000 CE a disaster which brought about the destruction of authentic Hungarian religious culture.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=240}} The church endorses the hypothesis of the kinship of Hungarians and Sumerians, and supports the use of the [[Old Hungarian alphabet]] instead of the Latin script.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=240}}

===Imre M√°t√©'s Yotengrit Church===
The Yotengrit Church (''Yotengrit Egyh√°z''), whose complete name is the Church of the Ancient Spirit of the Endless Sea (''Tengerv√©gtelen ≈ês-Szellem Egyh√°za''), was founded around 2007 by Imre M√°t√©. He, whose title in the organisation was ''b√°csa'' ("master"), emigrated to Germany in 1956, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|revolution]] against the communist government of the [[Hungarian People's Republic]] in which he participated. While in Germany, he worked as a businessman and poet, but returned to Hungary in the 2000s to spend his last years in [[B√°gyogszov√°t]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kolozsi|1y=2012|1p=90|2a1=Szil√°rdi|2y=2013|2p=241}} He founded the Yotengrit Church as the representative of the ancient Hungarian religion, the so-called "B√º√ºn-religion", passed down through the unwritten tradition of the ''tud√≥'' ("knower") people along the [[Raba (river)|Raba]] river. M√°t√© published a series of nine books, entitled ''Yotengrit'', in which he explained theology and linguistic etymology.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=241}} In recent years, the Yotengrit Church has become one of the most influential organisations of the Hungarian Native Faith. While it is considered by its adherents as a faithful heir of the pre-Christian Hungarian belief systems, it shows various non-indigenous influences.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=89}}

The theology of the Yotengrit Church emphasises a conception of primordial God, called ''Yotengrit'', ''Tengrit'' or ''[[Tengri]]'', which represents all the deities in their yet undivided state. In Hungarian the related word ''tenger'' means "sea", and represents such primordial undifferentiation. The primordial God then manifests as a male‚Äìfemale duality: Ukk√≥, the mother goddess whose forehead is decorated by the moon, and who is identified as the ''Boldogasszony'' (the "Blessed Lady") of Christianised folk beliefs; and G√∂n√ºz, the sun-faced father god.{{sfnm|1a1=Kolozsi|1y=2012|1pp=89‚Äì98|2a1=Szil√°rdi|2y=2013|2p=241}}

At the time of the foundation of the church, Imre M√°t√© proclaimed the importance of an all-encompassing conception of God:{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=241}}
{{Quote|In this Hungarian religion, it is very important that God is a very abstract concept; a spiritual power. He cannot be simply impersonated; whenever he was impersonated‚ÄîG√∂n√ºz, Ukk√≥ or Boldogasszony‚Äîit was always the result of human imagination.}}

At the same time, the theology emphasises a national god peculiar to the Hungarians, M√°-Tun, the deified hero of the folk tale entitled ''Feh√©rl√≥fia'' ("Son of the White Horse"), who was originally a totemic animal ancestor.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=241}} M√°-Tun is identified with the historical figure of [[Modu Chanyu|Maodu]], founder of the first [[Xiongnu]] empire, and according to M√°t√© also of the empire of the Huns.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=241}} The Yotengrit Church is politically neutral, but, as M√°t√©'s stated, its teachings may be a "source of sane, aggression-free national politics".{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=241}}

===L√°szl√≥ Nimr√≥d's Ancient Hungarian Church===
The Ancient Hungarian Church (''≈êsmagyar Egyh√°z''), whose Hungarian headquarters are located in [[Mogyor√≥d]], was first established in [[Budapest]] in the 1990 by L√°szl√≥ Hjad√∫ Nimr√≥d, and was officially registered in 1998.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=239}} Nimr√≥d spends most of the year in the [[United States]] and the church has international headquarters located in [[Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=239}} The doctrine of the Ancient Hungarian Church is a synthesis of ancient Hungarian, [[East Asian religions|East Asian]] and Christian beliefs, though all of them are claimed to be original Hungarian-Turanian beliefs.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=240}} The church has strict religious regulations. For instance, preachers have to wear white and purple clothes with folk patterns. They celebrate the major holidays of the Christian calendar, winter and summer solstice, national holidays and the birthdays of important Hungarian historical personages.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=240}}

===Zolt√°n S√≥lyomfi's Firebird Taltos Drum Circle===
The Firebird Taltos Drum Circle (''T≈±zmad√°r T√°ltos Dobk√∂r'') was founded in 2006 by Zolt√°n Nagy S√≥lyomfi, who also acted as the chief executive of the Yotengrit Church when it was registered by the government. He later left the Yotengrit Church for undisclosed internal disputes and, despite his wish to return, was not allowed to do so by M√°t√©.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=242}} The aim of the group is to revive ancient Hungarian spirituality, mediating it to society in modern forms, helping the individuals to understand themselves and thus healing the world tree, which manifests itself through the individuals.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=242}}

The theology of the Drum Circle is "based upon the ancient Hungarian conception of the world, which is the One (God) which incorporates everything that exists".{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=242}} S√≥lyomfi teaches that there are two worlds: One is the "manifest world" represented by the world tree, while the other one is the "unmanifested, unshaped space" which contains the "shared consciousness" of mankind.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=242}}

The Drum Circle emphasises practice over doctrine, including drumming, breathing and voice techniques.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=242}} The aim of these practices is to widen one's consciousness to understand the operations of the One, becoming like the One.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=242}} The group practises ritual ceremonies for birth, initiation, marriage, death and the feasts of the Yearly Round. The School of the Ancient Source (''≈êsforr√°s Iskola''), associated with the church, organises camps and pilgrimages.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=242}}

===Traditional Church of the Order of √Årp√°d===
The Traditional Church of the Order of √Årp√°d (''√Årp√°d Rendj√©nek Jogalapja Tradicion√°lis Egyh√°z'') was founded in 2009 and has its reference points in the Turanist emigree ideologists Adorj√°n Magyar and Victor Pad√°nyi, but it is also inspired by the [[Traditionalist School]], the [[Nouvelle Droite]] of [[Alain de Benoist]], and to the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=60}}

===Gaffer Bolya's Nest===
The group named Bolyanest (Gaffer Bolya's Nest) was founded in 1979 by Gaffer Bolya, a teacher in vocational secondary school titled ''Bolyap√≥'' within the group itself. Bolya's starting aim was to provide a way of good life for his students, whom formed the original core members of the group. The centre of the movement is in Budapest, and it was registered by the government in 1999.{{sfn|Cs√°ji|2017|p=214}} It is considered amongst the most influential Hungarian Native Faith movements today, especially concerning the process of re-mythologisation of Hungarian history.{{sfn|Cs√°ji|2017|p=215}} The group was originally focused on [[nature religion]], while in the most recent decades its focus has shifted to the discourse about ethnic roots.{{sfn|Cs√°ji|2017|p=215}}

Bolya acts as the group's ceremonial leader. The group has a core membership of around one hundred people, but its influence reaches the thousands of people. They are mostly from Budapest's middle class, but there are also farmers, entrepreneurs and intellectuals. The average age is over fifty-five and most of them are highly educated. They outspokenly identify themselves as non-Christians, though they do not presume to be the continuators of a well-defined pre-Christian religion; rather, they consciously construct a new religion based on Hungarian folklore and elements from other cultures' indigenous religions.{{sfn|Cs√°ji|2017|p=215}} Sumerian culture has been one of the main sources, although other cultures are explored too; for instance, Sumerian prayers are sung together with Russian songs.{{sfn|Cs√°ji|2017|pp=219‚Äì220}} They regard some natural sites surrounding Budapest and farther localities such as [[S√≥sk√∫t]], [[Borsodgeszt]], and Bodrogk√∂z, as their holy places where to make pilgrimage.{{sfn|Cs√°ji|2017|p=218}}

A fundamental teaching of Bolya is the conceptual distinction between "order" and "system", which remains the core of Bolyanest's thought. The former, the order, defines the natural way of being of everything in nature; everything is interconnected and interdependent, and each single part has a role in its instinctual cooperation with the others. The latter, the system, defines unnatural and artificial superstructures which take shape in societies when individuals and groups are surrounded by growing webs of norms, and are gradually alienated from each other and from their natural contexts. Gaffer Bolya was likely inspired by his studies of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s and [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s thought in the development of this vision.{{sfn|Cs√°ji|2017|p=216}}

==Identity and politics==
[[File:T√°ltos (4).jpg|thumb|Gathering of a Hungarian Native Faith group for the performance of a ritual. The two leading figures hold ritual spears with strips of cloth of the colours of the [[flag of Hungary]] tied near the tips.]]
===Nationalism and anti-multiculturalism===
Hungarian Native Faith groups generally put a great emphasis on the discourse about ethnic roots, which are re-mythologised. Many Hungarian Native Faith groups espouse [[nationalism|nationalistic]] political views and organise their communities in exclusive ways, exhibiting political intolerance. At the same time, [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]] and [[multiculturalism]] are viewed as disturbances which erode Hungarian identity.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=244}} The popularity of these stances is attributed by scholars to the abrupt fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], followed by spiritual vacuum and the perception of being invaded by a "multi-faceted cultural market", which created an identity crisis in post-Soviet countries.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=244}} In the case of Hungarian Native Faith groups, this resulted in a rejection of postmodern heterogeneity and a sacralisation of the national identity, in which language, religion and politics form a single entity.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=244}} Hungarian Native Faith groups see themselves as a core minority, amongst all Hungarians, which represents the quintessence of Hungarianness.{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=245}}

===Relationship with Christianity===
The relationship between Hungarian Native Faith and Christianity varies from church to church. Some Hungarian Native Faith groups use Christian themes and terminology in their own doctrines,{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=230}} or propose the incorporation of Christianity itself into the Hungarian Native Faith, such as in the case of groups developing in the wake of the teachings of Ferenc Badinyi-J√≥s.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=69 ff}} Others, like the Community of Hungarian Religion{{sfn|Szil√°rdi|2013|p=240}} and the Bolyanest, are instead outspokenly anti-Christian.{{sfn|Cs√°ji|2017|pp=215‚Äì216}}

A fundamental notion in Hungarian Native Faith is that each "nation" should have its own "faith", and a "Christian Hungary" represents an anomaly which needs to be rectified. This rectification should come from a liquidation of Christianity.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=101}} Even among those Hungarian Native Faith groups which nourish warm feelings towards Jesus, regarded as compatible with the indigenous religion, including the Yotengrit Church, the Christian religious institution as it developed after Jesus‚Äîthe so-called "[[Pauline Christianity]]"‚Äîis in any case perceived as a corrupt entity to be dismantled.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=95}} More in particular, among these groups it is [[Eastern Christianity]] to be valued as compatible with the indigenous religion, and to be considered closer to what Jesus intended, while [[Western Christianity]] (the forms which have historically been dominant in Hungary) is seen as its antithesis and as a deviant, evil teaching. In these groups, Jesus is reinterpreted as a powerful ancestor and shaman.{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=102}}

Within the Bolyanest, most of the members deem Christianity a [[superstition]] aimed at the control of people. Christian symbolic motifs such as the cross and the [[tree of life]] are considered, together with the sun and the moon, as symbols of natural pre-Christian religion which were appropriated by the Christian churches. The majority of believers regards Christianity as the force which eradicated this natural ancient knowledge, including original Hungarian religion, and as the force responsible for the [[disenchantment]] of the world.{{sfn|Cs√°ji|2017|pp=215‚Äì216}}

===Relationship with Central Asian Tengrism===
Those taltoses who espouse Turanist theories sometimes declare explicit affiliation with [[Tengrism]], the Turkic [[ethnic religion]].{{sfn|Kolozsi|2012|p=62}} This is the case of Zolt√°n S√≥lyomfi. These taltoses are generally characterised by their use of the Turkic name of God, ''[[Tengri]]'', instead of the Hungarian term ''Isten''.

In 2012 a nine-meters high ''√©let fa'' (tree of life) was donated by Hungarian Native Faith groups to the Tengrists of [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hongrie: le retour en force du n√©o-paganisme|url=http://www.hu-lala.org/2012/05/17/hongrie-le-retour-en-force-du-neo-paganisme/|website=Hulala|date=17 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620135853/http://www.hu-lala.org/2012/05/17/hongrie-le-retour-en-force-du-neo-paganisme/|archive-date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Ojun Adigzsi See-Oglu, a famous shaman from [[Tuva]], was invited to the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] to perform a ritual dance around the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] for the welfare of the Hungarian nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baumgartner|first=Vincent|title=Un chamane au secours de la Hongrie!|url=https://hu-lala.org/un-chamane-au-secours-de-la-hongrie/|website=Hulala|date=28 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922184958/https://hu-lala.org/un-chamane-au-secours-de-la-hongrie/|archive-date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Islamic Democratic Party''' (IDP) was an [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[political party]] from the [[Maldives]]. On June 2, 2005, the country's 50 member parliament voted unanimously to allow and operate political parties in Maldives. IDP subsequently submitted its registration and was registered. IDP was officially granted registration on December 12, 2005. The founding members are [[Umar Naseer]], Mohamed Haneef, Ahmed Inaz, Mohamed Ibrahim Didi, Abdulla Waheed and Mahamed Hassan Manik.

[[Umar Naseer]] was a Police officer respected by his superiors and subordinates alike. He was trained in [[UK]] in other countries. He operates a security firm called Alarms Pvt Ltd. and also Whale Submarine, which is a tourist submarine for enthusiasts who wants to look into the underwater world of [[Maldives]]. 

Mohamed Haneef was a police officer, who resigned from the military and began his political career. He is well known among Maldivians as the person who organised two strikes against then President [[Ibrahim Nasir]] in 1975.

The party was dissolved in 2013.

She is the recipient of [[Jane Fonda filmography|various accolades]] including two [[Academy Awards]], two [[BAFTA Awards]], four [[Golden Globe Awards]], a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]], and the [[Golden Lion#Golden Lion Honorary Award|Honorary Golden Lion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labiennale.org/en/news/jane-fonda-and-robert-redford-golden-lions-venice Jane Fonda and Robert Redford Golden Lions in Venice. ''[[labiennale.org]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Born to actor [[Henry Fonda]] and socialite [[Frances Ford Seymour]], Fonda made her [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] debut in the 1960 play ''There Was a Little Girl'', for which she received the first of two [[Tony Award]] nominations, and made her screen debut later the same year in ''[[Tall Story]]''. She rose to prominence in 1960s with such films as ''[[Period of Adjustment (film)|Period of Adjustment]]'' (1962), ''[[Sunday in New York]]'' (1963), ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[Barefoot in the Park (film)|Barefoot in the Park]]'' (1967) and ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968). Her first husband was ''Barbarella'' director [[Roger Vadim]]. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'' (1969) and went on to win two [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] Oscars in the 1970s for ''[[Klute]]'' (1971) and ''[[Coming Home (1978 film)|Coming Home]]'' (1978). Her other nominations were for ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'' (1977), ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' (1979), ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' (1981) and ''[[The Morning After (1986 film)|The Morning After]]'' (1986). Consecutive hits ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'' (1977), ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]]'' (1978), ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'' (1979) and ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' (1980) sustained Fonda's box-office drawing power, and she won an Primetime Emmy Award for her performance in the 1984 TV film ''[[The Dollmaker]]''.

In 1982, she released her first exercise video, ''Jane Fonda's Workout'', which became the highest-selling VHS of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shape.com/fitness/workouts/jane-fondas-workout-videos-be-released-dvd Jane Fonda's Workout Videos to Be Released on DVD]&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the first of 22 workout videos released by her over the next 13 years which would collectively sell over 17 million copies. Divorced from second husband [[Tom Hayden]], she married billionaire [[media mogul]] [[Ted Turner]] in 1991 and retired from acting, following a row of commercially unsuccessful films concluded by ''[[Stanley &amp; Iris]]'' (1990). Fonda divorced Turner in 2001 and returned to the screen with the 2005 hit ''[[Monster-in-Law]]''. Though ''[[Georgia Rule]]'' (2007) was the star's only other movie during the 2000s, in the early 2010s she fully re-launched her career. Subsequent films have included ''[[The Butler]]'' (2013), ''[[This Is Where I Leave You]]'' (2014), ''[[Youth (2015 film)|Youth]]'' (2015), ''[[Our Souls at Night (film)|Our Souls at Night]]'' (2017) and ''[[Book Club (film)|Book Club]]'' (2018). In 2009, she returned to Broadway after a 45-year absence from the stage, in the play ''[[33 Variations]]'' which earned her a Tony Award nomination, while her major recurring role in the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)|The Newsroom]]'' (2012‚Äì2014) earned her two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. She also released another five exercise videos between 2010 and 2012. Fonda currently stars in the [[Netflix]] original series ''[[Grace and Frankie]]'', which premiered in 2015 and has brought her nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].

Fonda was a visible political activist in the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture era]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and later became involved in advocacy for women. She was famously and controversially photographed sitting on a North Vietnamese [[anti-aircraft gun]] on a 1972 visit to [[Hanoi]], during which she became widely known under the nickname "Hanoi Jane." She has also protested the [[Iraq War]] and violence against women, and describes herself as a [[feminist]]. In 2005, she, [[Robin Morgan]] and [[Gloria Steinem]] co-founded the [[Women's Media Center]], an organization that works to amplify the voices of women in the media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves on the board of the organization.

==Early life==
[[File:Henry Fonda and Jane - 1943.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Fonda with father, Navy Lieutenant [[Henry Fonda]] (1943)]]
Jane Seymour Fonda was born in New York City&lt;ref name=biography.com /&gt; on December 21, 1937. Her parents were Canadian-born socialite [[Frances Ford Seymour|Frances Ford Brokaw]] (n√©e Seymour; 1908&amp;ndash;1950),  and actor [[Henry Fonda]] (1905&amp;ndash;1982). According to her father, their surname came from an Italian ancestor who immigrated to the Netherlands in the 1500s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Henry Fonda| first=Henry| last= Fonda|title= My Life|location= New York|publisher= Dutton|year=1981}} '''page=???'''&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There, he intermarried, and the family began to use Dutch given names, with Jane's first Fonda ancestor reaching New York in 1650.&lt;ref&gt;The Fonda immigrant ancestor came from [[Eagum]] (also spelled Augum or Agum), a village in [[Friesland]], a northern province of the Netherlands. Jellis Douwe Fonda (1614‚Äì1659), a Dutch emigrant from Friesland, immigrated and first went to Beverwyck (now [[Albany, New York|Albany]]) in 1650; he was the founder of the City of [[Fonda, New York]] (see {{cite web|url=http://www.fonda.org|title=Descendants of Jellis Douw Fonda (1614‚Äì1659)|publisher=fonda.org}} and {{cite web|url= http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/peter-fonda/index.html|publisher=[[genealogy.com]]|title=Ancestry of Peter Fonda|archivedate=March 15, 2012|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120315121423/http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/peter-fonda/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title='Jane: An Intimate Biography of Jane Fonda|first=Thomas |last=Kiernan|publisher= Putnam|year=1973|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Citizen Jane: The Turbulent Life of Jane Fonda| authorlink= Christopher P. Andersen|first=Christopher P. |last=Andersen|publisher= Dell |year=1991|page=.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also has English, Scottish, and French ancestry. She was named for the third wife of [[Henry VIII]], [[Jane Seymour]], to whom she is distantly related on her mother's side.&lt;ref&gt;Fonda, 2005, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; She has a brother, [[Peter Fonda|Peter]], who is also an actor, and a maternal half-sister, Frances de Villers Brokaw (aka "Pan"), whose daughter is Pilar Corrias, the owner of the Pilar Corrias Gallery in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3562051/Pilar-Corrias-a-new-gallery-for-a-new-era.html|location=London|title=Pilar Corrias: a new gallery for a new era|first=Jo|last=Craven|date=October 12, 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, when Fonda was 12, her mother committed [[suicide]] while undergoing treatment at Craig House psychiatric hospital in [[Beacon, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://roadtrippers.com/us/beacon-ny/points-of-interest/the-craig-house-institute-tioranda?lat=40.80972&amp;lng=-96.67528&amp;z=5 |title=The Craig House Institute / Tioranda, Beacon |publisher=Roadtrippers |date= |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fonda, 2005, pp. 16‚Äì17.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Fonda's father married socialite [[Susan Blanchard (socialite)|Susan Blanchard]] (born 1928), 23 years his junior; this marriage ended in divorce. At 15 Fonda taught dance at [[Fire Island Pines, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fireislandnews.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=419&amp;Itemid=77&amp;date=2008-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111202/http://fireislandnews.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=419&amp;Itemid=77&amp;date=2008-07-01 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 5, 2008 |title=SAGE Nets $35K at Annual Pines F√™te |publisher=Fire Island News |date=June 25, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Greenwich Academy]] in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]].

Fonda attended the [[Emma Willard School]] in [[Troy, New York]], and [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie]].&lt;ref name="Sonneborn2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sonneborn|first=Liz|title=A to Z of American women in the performing arts|year=2002|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|isbn=0-8160-4398-1|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before her acting career, she was a [[model (person)|model]], appearing twice on the cover of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.&lt;ref name="Browne2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Pat|last2=Browne|first2=Ray Broadus|title=The guide to United States popular culture|year=2001|publisher=Bowling Green State University Popular Press|location=Bowling Green, Ohio|isbn=0-87972-821-3|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
Fonda became interested in acting as a teenager, while appearing with her father in a charity performance of ''The Country Girl'' at the [[Omaha Community Playhouse]].&lt;ref name="Browne2001"/&gt; After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for six months to study art.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|title=Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|year= 2011|ISBN=0-547-50447-0|pages=98, 315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to the states, in 1958, she met [[Lee Strasberg]] and the meeting changed the course of her life, Fonda saying, "I went to the [[Actors Studio]] and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It was the first time that anyone, except my father ‚Äì who had to say so ‚Äì told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!"&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Arnold W., and Blau, Judith R. ''Art and Society: Readings in the Sociology of the Arts'', SUNY Press (1989) pp. 118‚Äì119. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-0116-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to prominence (1960‚Äì1969)===
{{More footnotes|section|date=September 2018}}
Fonda's stage work in the late 1950s laid the foundation for her film career in the 1960s. She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with ''[[Tall Story]]'', in which she recreated one of her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by [[Anthony Perkins]]. Frequent collaborator [[Robert Redford]] also made his debut in that film. ''[[Period of Adjustment (film)|Period of Adjustment]]'' and ''[[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|Walk on the Wild Side]]'' followed in 1962. The latter, in which she played a prostitute, earned her a [[Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year ‚Äì Actress|Most Promising Newcomer]].

In 1963, she appeared in ''[[Sunday in New York]]''. ''[[Newsday]]'' called her "the loveliest and most gifted of all our new young actresses".&lt;ref&gt;[33-preludes-to-33-variations-the-early-broadway-years-of-jane-fonda 33 Preludes to 33 Variations: The Early Broadway Years of Jane Fonda ]&lt;/ref&gt; However, she also had detractors ‚Äì in the same year, the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' named her the "Year's Worst Actress" for ''[[The Chapman Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19630406&amp;id=kEc0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qGUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3613,1057920|title=Harvard Lampoon Lampoons Films|date=April 6, 1963|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fonda's career breakthrough came with ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), in which she played a schoolmarm turned outlaw. This comedy [[Western (genre)|Western]] received five [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations, with [[Lee Marvin]] winning best actor, and was one of the year's top ten films at the box office. It was considered by many to have been the film that brought Fonda to [[bankable]] stardom. After this came the comedies ''[[Any Wednesday]]'' (1966), opposite [[Jason Robards]] and [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]], and ''[[Barefoot in the Park (film)|Barefoot in the Park]]'' (1967), co-starring Robert Redford.

In 1968, she played the title role in the [[science fiction]] spoof ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'', which established her status as a [[sex symbol]]. In contrast, the tragedy ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'' (1969) won her critical acclaim, and she earned her first Oscar nomination for the role. Fonda was very selective by the end of the decade, turning down lead roles in ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' and ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''.

===Established actress (1970‚Äì1979)===
Fonda won her first [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in 1971, again playing a prostitute, the [[gamine]] Bree Daniels, in the murder mystery ''[[Klute]]''. She won her second Oscar in 1978 for her role as an adulteress in ''[[Coming Home (1978 film)|Coming Home]]'', the story of a disabled Vietnam War veteran's difficulty in re-entering civilian life.&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Both performances earned her a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]] as well.

Between ''Klute'' in 1971 and ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|Fun With Dick and Jane]]'' in 1977, Fonda did not have a major film success. She appeared in ''[[A Doll's House (1973 Losey film)|A Doll's House]]'' (1973), ''[[Steelyard Blues]]'' and ''[[The Blue Bird (1976 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' (1976). From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: "I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/janefonda/ Jane Fonda profile]. ''Hello! Magazine''; retrieved April 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in her 2005 autobiography, ''My Life So Far'', she rejected such simplification. "The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed."&lt;ref&gt;Fonda, 2005, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=Jane Fonda did an extraordinary job with her part. She is a splendid actress with a strong analytical mind which sometimes gets in her way, and with an incredible technique and control of emotion; she can cry at will, on cue, mere drops or buckets, as the scene demands ... I thought Jane well deserved the Oscar she should have got.&lt;ref name=Zinnemann&gt;Zinnemann, Fred. ''A Life in the Movies. An Autobiography'', Macmillan Books, (1992) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;|source= ‚Äî[[Fred Zinnemann]]&lt;br&gt;director of ''Julia'' (1977)}}

In 1972, Fonda starred as a reporter alongside [[Yves Montand]] in ''[[Tout Va Bien]]'', directed by [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Jean-Pierre Gorin]]. The two directors then made ''[[Letter to Jane]]'', in which the two spent nearly an hour discussing a news photograph of Fonda.

Through her production company, IPC Films, she produced films that helped return her to star status. The 1977 comedy film ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|Fun With Dick and Jane]]'' is generally considered her "comeback" picture. Also in 1977, she portrayed the playwright [[Lillian Hellman]] in ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'', receiving positive reviews, [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama|Golden Globe]] Awards for Best Actress, and an Oscar nomination.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; During this period, Fonda announced that she would make only films that focused on important issues, and she generally stuck to her word. She turned down ''[[An Unmarried Woman]]'' because she felt the part was not relevant. She won another BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 1979 with ''[[The China Syndrome]]'', about a cover-up of a vulnerability in a [[nuclear power plant]]. The same year, she starred in ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'' with her previous co-star, [[Robert Redford]].

===Critically acclaimed performances (1980‚Äì1990)===
[[File:Jane Fonda 1990.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|Fonda and photographer Alan Light following the [[62nd Academy Awards]] in 1990]]
In 1980, Fonda starred in ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' with [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dolly Parton]]. The film was a huge critical and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1980 1980 Yearly Box Office Results. ''[[boxofficemojo.com]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; Fonda had long wanted to work with her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play ''[[On Golden Pond (play)|On Golden Pond]]'', specifically for her father and her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Barbarella-comes-of-age/2005/05/12/1115843302558.html "Barbarella comes of age"], ''[[The Age]]'', May 14, 2005; retrieved May 5, 2008. "If Barbarella was an act of rebellion, On Golden Pond (1981) was a more mature rapprochement: Fonda bought the rights to Ernest Thompson's play to offer the role to her father."&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'', which also starred [[Katharine Hepburn]], brought Henry Fonda his only [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;

Fonda continued to appear in feature films throughout the 1980s, winning an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress]] for ''[[The Dollmaker]]'' (1984), and starring in the role of Dr. Martha Livingston in ''[[Agnes of God (film)|Agnes of God]]'' (1985). She was nominated for yet another [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her portrayal of an [[alcoholic]] murder suspect in the 1986 thriller ''[[The Morning After (1986 film)|The Morning After]]'', opposite [[Jeff Bridges]]. She ended the decade by appearing in ''[[Old Gringo]]''. This was followed by the romantic drama ''[[Stanley &amp; Iris]]'' (1990) with [[Robert De Niro]], which was her final film for 15 years.

====Exercise videos====
For many years Fonda took [[ballet]] class to keep fit, but after fracturing her foot while filming ''The China Syndrome'', she was no longer able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in [[aerobics]] and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The ''Leni Workout'' became the ''Jane Fonda Workout'', which began a second career for her, continuing for many years.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among [[baby boomers]], then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled ''Jane Fonda's Workout'', inspired by her best-selling book, ''[[Jane Fonda's Workout Book]]''. ''Jane Fonda's Workout'' became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new [[VCR]] in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney Galanty, who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl, of Karl Home Video. Galanty produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/jane-fonda-back-leotard-72-iconic-actress-fitness-guru-debut-new-fitness-dvds-article-1.438610|title=Jane Fonda is back in her leotard, at 72; iconic actress and fitness guru to debut new fitness DVDs|last=Goldwert|first=Lindsay|date=September 14, 2010|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement and return===

==Political activism==
During the 1960s, Fonda engaged in [[political activism]] in support of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and in [[opposition to the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Fonda's visits to France brought her into contact with leftist French intellectuals who were opposed to war, an experience that she later characterized as "small-c communism".&lt;ref&gt;Fonda, 2005, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other celebrities, she supported the [[Alcatraz Island]] occupation by [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in 1969, which was intended to call attention to the failures of the government with regards to treaty rights and the movement for greater Indian sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/itvs/alcatrazisnotanisland/occupation.html|title=Alcatraz is Not an Island|publisher=PBS|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She supported [[Huey Newton]] and the [[Black Panthers]] in the early 1970s, stating: "Revolution is an act of love; we are the children of revolution, born to be rebels. It runs in our blood." She called the Black Panthers "our revolutionary vanguard ... we must support them with love, money, [[propaganda]] and risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Black Panthers |work=[[Socialist Worker#United Kingdom|Socialist Worker]] |location=London, UK |url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=10386 |date=January 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807074004/https://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=10386 |archivedate=August 7, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been involved in the [[feminist movement]] since the 1970s and dovetails her activism in support of [[civil rights]].

===Opposition to the Vietnam War===

[[File:Jane Fonda 1975d.jpg|thumb|left|Fonda at an anti-Vietnam War conference in the Netherlands in January 1975]]
In April 1970, Fonda, with [[Fred Gardner (activist)|Fred Gardner]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] formed the [[Free The Army tour|FTA tour]] ("Free The Army", a play on the troop expression "Fuck The Army"), an anti-war road show designed as an answer to [[Bob Hope]]'s [[United Service Organizations|USO]] tour. The tour, described as "political [[vaudeville]]" by Fonda, visited military towns along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], with the goal of establishing a dialogue with soldiers about their upcoming deployments to Vietnam. The dialogue was made into a movie (''F.T.A.'') which contained strong, frank criticism of the war by servicemen and servicewomen; it was released in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&amp;Id=2376 Rotten Tomatoes profile of ''F.T.A.'']; retrieved April 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 1970, Fonda appeared before an assembly at the [[University of New Mexico]], in Albuquerque, to speak on GI rights and issues. The end of her presentation was met with a discomforting silence. The quiet was broken when [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poet [[Gregory Corso]] staggered onto the stage. Drunk, Corso challenged Fonda, using a four-letter expletive: Why hadn't she addressed the [[Kent State shootings|shooting of four students at Kent State]] by the Ohio National Guard, which had just taken place? Fonda in her autobiography revisited the incident: "I was shocked by the news and felt like a fool." On the same day, she joined a protest march on the home of university president, Ferrel Heady. The protestors called themselves "They Shoot Students, Don't They?" ‚Äì a reference to Fonda's recently released film, ''They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'', which was just screened in Albuquerque.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"/&gt;

In the same year, Fonda spoke out against the war at a rally organized by [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]] (VVAW) in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]]. She offered to help raise funds for VVAW and, for her efforts, was rewarded with the title of Honorary National Coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books|5hq2_JFvV0kC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=Home to war: a history of the Vietnam veterans' movement|last=Nicosia|first=Gerald|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7867-1403-2|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 3, 1970, Fonda started a tour of college campuses on which she raised funds for the organization. As noted by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Fonda was a "major patron" of the VVAW.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/28/us/2004-campaign-massachusetts-senator-71-antiwar-words-complex-view-kerry.html The 2004 Campaign: The Massachusetts Senator; In '71 Antiwar Words, a Complex View of Kerry]; ''[[New York Times]]''; Todd S.

====Controversial visit to Hanoi====
[[File:Hanoi Jane.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Jane Fonda on the NVA anti-aircraft gun]]
Between 1965 and 1972, almost 300 Americans ‚Äì mostly civil rights activists, teachers and pastors ‚Äì traveled to North Vietnam to see firsthand the war situation with the Vietnamese.  News media in the United States predominantly provided a U.S. viewpoint, and American travelers to Vietnam were routinely harassed upon their return to the States.&lt;ref name="Hershberger1"&gt;''Jane Fonda's War: A Political Biography of an Antiwar Icon''; Mary Hershberger; The New Press; pp. 75‚Äì81&lt;/ref&gt;  Fonda also visited Vietnam, traveling to [[Hanoi]] in July 1972 to witness firsthand the bombing damage to the dikes. After touring and photographing dike systems in North Vietnam, she said the United States had been [[Bombing of Vietnam's dikes|intentionally targeting the dike system along the Red River]]. Columnist [[Joseph Kraft]], who was also touring North Vietnam, said he believed the damage to the dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that, if the U.S. Air Force were "truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879148,00.html|title=The Battle of the Dikes|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 7, 1972|accessdate=April 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden's ambassador to Vietnam, however, observed the bomb damage to the dikes and described it as "methodic". Other journalists reported that the attacks were "aimed at the whole system of dikes".&lt;ref name="Hershberger1"/&gt;

Fonda was photographed seated on an [[anti-aircraft gun]]; the controversial photo outraged a number of Americans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jane Fonda relives her protest days on the set of her new film|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/7911158/Jane-Fonda-relives-her-protest-days-on-the-set-of-her-new-film.html|date=July 26, 2010|first=Laura|last=Roberts|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned her the nickname "Hanoi Jane".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/23/list-top-10-jane-fonda-mistakes/ |work=Washington Times |title=Jane Fonda mistakes |date=December 23, 2012 |accessdate=November 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012201224/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/23/list-top-10-jane-fonda-mistakes/ |archivedate=October 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2005 autobiography, she wrote that she was manipulated into sitting on the battery; she had been horrified at the implications of the pictures and regretted taking them. In a 2011 entry at her official website, Fonda explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It happened on my last day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit&amp;nbsp;... The translator told me that the soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return&amp;nbsp;... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me&amp;nbsp;... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all had nothing to do with where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed&amp;nbsp;... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen&amp;nbsp;... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever&amp;nbsp;... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.&lt;ref name=truth2011july&gt;[http://janefonda.com/the-truth-about-my-trip-to-hanoi "The Truth About My Trip To Hanoi"].

Fonda made radio broadcasts on Hanoi Radio throughout her two-week tour, commenting on her visits to villages, hospitals, schools, and factories damaged in the war and denouncing U.S. military policy in Vietnam. Fonda has defended her decision to travel to North Vietnam, and her radio broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life So Far|first=Jane|last=Fonda|publisher=Random House|year=2005|ISBN=978-1-588-36478-4|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snopes2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/military/fonda.asp|title=Hanoi'd with Jane|publisher=[[Snopes.com]]|date=May 25, 2005|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of her visit, Fonda visited American [[prisoners of war]] (POWs), and brought back messages from them to their families. When stories of torture of returning POWs were later being publicized by the Nixon administration, Fonda called the returning POWs "hypocrites and liars and pawns", adding about the prisoners she visited, "These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed."&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Fonda told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1973, "I'm quite sure that there were incidents of torture&amp;nbsp;... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic, I believe that's a lie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jane Fonda Grants Some P.O.W. Torture|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/07/archives/jane-fonda-grants-some-pow-torture.html|work=The New York Times|date=April 7, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her visits to the POW camp led to persistent and exaggerated rumors which were repeated widely in the press and continued to circulate on the Internet decades later. Fonda, as well as the named POWs, have personally denied the rumors,&lt;ref name=truth2011july/&gt; and subsequent interviews with the POWs showed these rumored allegations to be false as the persons named had never met Fonda.&lt;ref name="snopes2005"/&gt;

In 1972, Fonda helped fund and organize the Indochina Peace Campaign, which&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwluherstory.com/indochina-peace-campaign.html |title=Indochina Peace Campaign |publisher=The Chicago Women's Liberation Union Herstory Project |work=Womankind |date=November 1972 |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708214602/https://www.cwluherstory.com/indochina-peace-campaign.html |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; continued to mobilize antiwar activists across the nation after the 1973 [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris Peace Agreement]], through 1975, when the United States withdrew from Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indochina Peace Campaign, Boston Office: Records, 1972‚Äì1975 |url=http://www.lib.umb.edu/node/1607|publisher=University of Massachusetts|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of her tour of North Vietnam during wartime and the subsequent rumors circulated about her visit, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists. For example, when a [[U.S. Naval Academy]] plebe ritually shouted out "Goodnight, Jane Fonda!", the entire company of midshipmen plebes, who had not yet been born when Fonda protested against the Vietnam War, replied "Goodnight, bitch!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/fonda.html|title=Hating Jane: The American Military and Jane Fonda|last=Brush|first=Peter|publisher=Vanderbilt University|year=2004|archivedate=April 4, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404102645/http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/brush/fonda.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4TMYCIt5ywC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;lpg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q=%22good%20night%20jane%20fonda%22|isbn=978-0-19-518172-2|first=Steven J.|last=Ross|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=229|chapter=Movement Leader, Grassroots Builder: Jane Fonda|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's ''Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures|url=http://www.usna.edu/Commandant/Instructions/COMDTMIDNINST_3120.1J_PLEBE_SUMMER_STANDARD_OPERATING_PROCEDURES.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719091245/http://www.usna.edu/Commandant/Instructions/COMDTMIDNINST_3120.1J_PLEBE_SUMMER_STANDARD_OPERATING_PROCEDURES.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 19, 2013|publisher=United States Naval Academy|accessdate=April 14, 2013|pages=5‚Äì4|format=PDF|date=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Michael A.

====Regrets====
In a 1988 interview with [[Barbara Walters]], Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. ... I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Barbara Walters|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pacificaviet.html#aftermath|publisher=UC Berkeley Library Sound Recording Project|year=1988|accessdate=February 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics responded that her apology came at a time when a group of New England Veterans had launched a campaign to disrupt a film project she was working on, leading to the charge that her apology was motivated at least partly by self-interest.&lt;ref name="snopes2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Jonah (June 23, 2000). [http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/jonah062300.asp "If Fonda is sorry, let her say so"]. ''Jewish World Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated that she had no regrets about her trip to [[North Vietnam]] in 1972, with the exception of the anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a "betrayal" of American forces and of the "country that gave me privilege". Fonda said, "The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine." She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as [[propaganda]] and pride for her anti-war activism: "There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's not something that I will apologize for." Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: "Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/31/60minutes/main684295_page2.shtml|title=Jane Fonda: Wish I Hadn't|publisher=CBS|work=60 minutes|accessdate=February 16, 2008|date=March 31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, it was revealed that Fonda was one of approximately 1,600 Americans whose communications between 1967 and 1973 were monitored by the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) as part of [[Project Minaret]], a program that some NSA officials have described as "disreputable if not downright illegal".&lt;ref name=nsarchive-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Disreputable if Not Outright Illegal': The National Security Agency versus Martin Luther King, Muhammad Ali, Art Buchwald, Frank Church, et al.|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB441|work=National Security Archive|publisher=George Washington University|editor=Burr, William|editor2=Aid, Matthew M.|date=September 25, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926223814/http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB441/|archivedate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pilkington-2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilkington |first=Ed |title=Declassified NSA files show agency spied on Muhammad Ali and MLK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-anti-vietnam-muhammad-ali-mlk |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=September 26, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JvNdF5AX?url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-anti-vietnam-muhammad-ali-mlk |archivedate=September 26, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fonda's communications, as well as those of her husband, [[Tom Hayden]], were intercepted by Britain's [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ).

====1970 Arrest====
On November 3, 1970, Fonda was arrested by authorities at [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] on suspicion of [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]].&lt;ref name="Blog"/&gt; She had been re-entering the United States after participating in an anti-war college speaking tour in Canada, when her luggage was searched, and several small baggies containing pills seized.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt; Although Fonda protested that the pills were harmless vitamins, she was booked by police and then released on bond. Fonda alleged that the arresting officer told her he was acting on direct orders from the Nixon White House.&lt;ref name="Late Show with Stephen Colbert"&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc2OGt2_85Y| title=Jane Fonda's Activism Drew the Ire of Nixon| author=Late Show with Stephen Colbert| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2018-09-20| access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote in 2009 that "I told them what [the vitamins] were but they said they were getting orders from the White House.

Fonda's mugshot from the arrest, in which she [[Raised fist|raises her fist]] in a sign of solidarity, has since become a famous image of the actress.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jane-fonda-is-selling-merchandise-with-her-1970-mugshot-on-it_us_58cbe76ae4b0be71dcf40329| title=Jane Fonda is Selling Merchandise With Her 1970 Mugshot On It| author=Alanna Vagianos| publisher=Huffington Post| date=2017-03-17| access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as the poster image for the 2018 [[Home Box Office|HBO]] documentary on Fonda, "Jane Fonda in Five Acts", with a giant billboard sporting the image erected in [[Times Square]] in September, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.eonline.com/videos/277943/jane-fonda-never-expected-to-see-her-mugshot-on-billboards| title=Jane Fonda Never Expected To See Her Mugshot on Billboards| author=E News| publisher=www.eonline.com| access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, she began selling merchandise with her mugshot image to benefit the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power &amp; Potential.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt;

===Feminist causes===

In early March 2017, in an interview with [[Brie Larson]], published by [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]], Fonda stated, "One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse is) not our fault. We were violated and it's not right." She said, "I've been raped, I've been sexually abused as a child and I've been fired because I wouldn't sleep with my boss." She said, "I always thought it was my fault; that I didn't do or say the right thing. I know young girls who've been raped and didn't even know it was rape. They think, 'It must have been because I said 'no' the wrong way.'"

Through her work, Fonda said she wants to help abuse victims "realize that [rape and abuse] is not our fault". Fonda said that her difficult past led her to become such a passionate activist for women's rights. The actress is an active supporter of the V-Day movement, which works to stop violence against women and girls. In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health, which aims to help prevent teen pregnancy. She was a victim of the "disease to please" in her early life, which plagued many American females of her generation.  Fonda revealed in 2014 that her mother, [[Frances Ford Seymour]], was recurrently sexually abused as young as eight, and this may have led to her suicide when Jane was 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/movies/jane-fonda-reveals-she-was-raped-and-sexually-abused-as-a-child-i-always-thought-it-was-my-fault/|title=Jane Fonda Reveals She Was Raped ‚Äì and Sexually Abused as a Child: 'I Always Thought It Was My Fault'|date=March 2, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-39151842 Jane Fonda reveals rape and child abuse ‚Äì BBC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ms. magazine Cover - Winter 2006.jpg|thumbnail|Fonda on the cover of [[Ms. (magazine)|''Ms.'' magazine]] in 2006]]Fonda has been a longtime supporter of feminist causes, including [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]], a movement to stop violence against women, inspired by the off-Broadway hit ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', of which she is an honorary chairperson. She was at the first summit in 2002, bringing together founder [[Eve Ensler]], Afghan women oppressed by the [[Taliban]], and a [[Kenya]]n activist campaigning to save girls from [[Female genital mutilation|genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vday.org/static/presskit/2007OnlinePressKit.pdf|format=PDF|title=V-Day's 2007 Press Kit|publisher=V-Day|accessdate=February 15, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227203051/http://www.vday.org/static/presskit/2007OnlinePressKit.pdf|archivedate=February 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta]] to help prevent adolescent pregnancy through training and program development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gynob.emory.edu/jfc_prog_teenservices.cfm|title=Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health|publisher=Emory University, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics|accessdate=February 3, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111100335/http://gynob.emory.edu/jfc_prog_teenservices.cfm|archivedate=November 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2004, Fonda led a march through [[Ciudad Ju√°rez]], with [[Sally Field]], [[Eve Ensler]] and other women, urging [[Mexico]] to provide sufficient resources to newly appointed officials in helping investigate the murders of hundreds of women in the rough border city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/10/entertainment/main1604992.shtml|title=Actresses Speak Out in Mexico City|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=February 15, 2008|date=May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, she also served as a mentor to the first all-[[transgender]] cast of ''The Vagina Monologues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/Beautiful%20Daughters/Beautiful%20Daughters.html|title=Beautiful Daughters|author=Josh Aronson and Ariel Orr Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days before the September 17, 2006 [[Sweden|Swedish]] elections, Fonda went to Sweden to support the new political party [[Feministiskt initiativ]] in their election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.se/se/article/2006/09/15/13/5501-23/index.xml|title=Jane Fonda FI:s galjonsfigur f√∂r en dag|publisher=Metro International|accessdate=February 15, 2008|date=September 9, 2006|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''My Life So Far'', Fonda stated that she considers [[patriarchy]] to be harmful to men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were "anti-male". But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she "still loves men", adding that when she divorced Ted Turner, she felt like she had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so.&lt;ref&gt;Fonda, ''My Life So Far''.&lt;!-- pages?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Fonda said that while she was 'glad' that [[Bernie Sanders]] was running, she predicted [[Hillary Clinton]] would become the first female [[President of the United States|president]], whose win Fonda believed would result in a "violent backlash". Fonda went on to say that we need to "help men understand why they are so threatened ‚Äì and change the way we view masculinity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/15/jane-fonda-hillary-clinton-tribeca-film-festival|title=Jane Fonda at Tribeca: 'Hillary Clinton will be president'|last=Smith|first=Nigel M.|date=April 15, 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=May 8, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Americans===
Fonda went to [[Seattle]], in 1970 to support a group of Native Americans who were led by [[Bernie Whitebear]]. The group had occupied part of the grounds of [[Fort Lawton]], which was in the process of being surplussed by the [[United States Army]] and turned into a park. The group was attempting to secure a land base where they could establish services for the sizable local [[urban Indian]] population, protesting that "Indians had a right to part of the land that was originally all theirs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tizon|first=Alex|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971202&amp;slug=2575788|title=Facing The End, Activist Reflects On Life's Victories|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=December 2, 1997|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The endeavor succeeded and the [[Daybreak Star Cultural Center]] was constructed in the city's Discovery Park.&lt;ref&gt;Whitebear, Bernie.

In addition to environmental reasons, Fonda has been a critic of oil pipelines because of their being built without consent on Native American Land. In 2017, Fonda responded to American President Donald Trump's mandate to resume construction of the controversial North Dakota Pipelines by saying that Trump "does this illegally because he has not gotten consent from the tribes through whose countries this goes" and pointing out that "the U.S. has agreed to treaties that require them to get the consent of the people who are affected, the indigenous people who live there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/jane-fonda-rails-trump-pipeline-orders-nyc-protest-article-1.2954920|title=Jane Fonda rails against President Trump's pipeline orders at Manhattan protest|publisher=New York Daily News|date=January 24, 2017|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict===
In December 2002, Fonda visited [[Israel]] and the [[West Bank]] as part of a tour focusing on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with [[Women in Black]] against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and [[Gaza Strip]] outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors, and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to [[Ramallah]] to see a physical rehabilitation center and Palestinian refugee camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2595375.stm "Fonda joins Jerusalem demo"].

In September 2009, she was one of more than 1,500 signatories to a letter protesting the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]]'s spotlight on [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/9/14/no_celebration_of_occupation_1_500|title=No Celebration of Occupation: 1,500 Artists and Writers Sign Letter Protesting Toronto Film Festival Decision to Spotlight Tel Aviv |work=Democracy Now!|date=September 14, 2009|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest letter said that the spotlight on Tel Aviv was part of "the Israeli propaganda machine" because it was supported in part by funding from the Israeli government and had been described by the Israeli Consul General Amir Gissin as being part of a Brand Israel campaign intended to draw attention away from [[Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict|Israel's conflict with the Palestinians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15198&amp;pop=1&amp;page=0&amp;Itemid=86 |title="Brand Israel set to launch in GTA" |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912044103/http://www.cjnews.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15198&amp;pop=1&amp;page=0&amp;Itemid=86 |archivedate=September 12, 2009 |df=mdy }}.

Rabbi [[Marvin Hier]] of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] stated that "People who support letters like this are people who do not support a two-state solution. By calling into question the legitimacy of Tel Aviv, they are supporting a one-state solution, which means the destruction of the State of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/16/toronto-festival-israel-tel-aviv US actor Jane Fonda backs away from Israel row at Toronto film festival]; The Guardian; September 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Hier continued, saying that "it is clear that the script [the protesters] are reading from might as well have been written by Hamas."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/693960 "To criticize Israel is a dangerous thing in today's Canada"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]''. September 11, 2009; accessed February 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fonda, in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', said she regretted some of the language used in the original protest letter and how it "was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers." She continued, writing "the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens."&lt;ref name="FondaHP2009"&gt;Fonda, Jane (September 15, 2009).

I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people."&lt;ref name="FondaHP2009" /&gt; Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to ''The Huffington Post'' rejecting the vilification of Fonda, who they described as "a strong supporter and friend of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;Minkin, David (September 14, 2009).

===Opposition to the Iraq War===
{{See also|Opposition to the Iraq War}}
Fonda argued that the military campaign in Iraq will turn people all over the world against America, and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war. In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jane Fonda to oppose Iraq war on bus tour |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-07-25-fonda_x.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210025522/http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-07-25-fonda_x.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 10, 2006 |date=July 25, 2005 |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=January 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from [[Cindy Sheehan]]'s activism.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Roger (September 7, 2005), [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,168646,00.html "Fonda Puts Brakes on Bus Tour"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106152330/https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,168646,00.html |date=November 6, 2018 }}, FOX News; retrieved April 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, Fonda was scheduled to join British politician and anti-war activist [[George Galloway]] at two stops on his U.S. book tour, [[Madison, Wisconsin]] and [[Chicago]]. She canceled her appearances at the last minute, citing instructions from her doctors to avoid travel following recent hip surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jane stands up Gorgeous George|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article570563.ece|date=September 25, 2005|first=Sarah|last=Baxter|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|location=London, UK|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 2007, Fonda participated in an anti-war rally and march held on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., declaring that "silence is no longer an option".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=War protesters demand U.S. troop withdrawal|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16841070|date=January 27, 2007|publisher=[[msnbc.com]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke at an anti-war rally earlier that day at the [[United States Navy Memorial|Navy Memorial]], where members of the organization [[Free Republic]] picketed in a counter protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands Protest Bush Policy| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/27/AR2007012700629_2.html|date=January 28, 2007|first=Michael|last=Ruane|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=2| first2=Fredrick|last2=Kunkle|lastauthoramp=yes|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fonda and Kerry===
In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], her name was used as a disparaging epithet against [[John Kerry]], a former VVAW leader, who was then the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] presidential candidate. [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican National Committee]] Chairman [[Ed Gillespie]] called Kerry a "Jane Fonda Democrat". Kerry's opponents also [[Kerry Fonda 2004 election photo controversy|circulated a photograph]] showing Fonda and Kerry in the same large crowd at a 1970 anti-war rally, though they sat several rows apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/kerry.asp " Does a photograph show Senator John Kerry at a 1970 anti-war rally?"] Snopes; retrieved April 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A faked composite photograph, which gave a false impression that the two had shared a speaker's platform, was also circulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/kerry2.asp "Does a photograph show Senator John Kerry and Jane Fonda sharing a speaker's platform at an anti-war rally?"] Snopes.com; retrieved April 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmentalism===
In 2015, Fonda expressed disapproval of President Barack Obama's permitting of [[Arctic]] drilling ([[Petroleum exploration in the Arctic]]) at the Sundance Film Festival. In July, she marched in a Toronto protest called the "March for Jobs, Justice, and Climate", which was organized by dozens of nonprofits, labor unions, and environmental activists, including Canadian author [[Naomi Klein]]. The march aimed to show businesses and politicians alike that climate change is inherently linked to issues that may seem unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swann|first1=Jennifer|title=Marching for Action on Climate Change, Jane Fonda Warns Against Arctic Oil Drilling|url=https://www.takepart.com/article/2015/07/05/jane-fonda-climate-change|accessdate=July 6, 2015|publisher=take part|date=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to issues of Civil Rights, Fonda has been an opponent of oil developments and their adverse effects on the environment. In 2017, while on a trip with [[Greenpeace]] to protest oil developments, Fonda criticized [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Justin Trudeau]] saying at the summit on climate change in Paris, known as the [[Paris agreement]], Trudeau "talked so beautifully of needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty and to respect and hold to the treaties with indigenous people ... and yet he has betrayed every one of the things he committed to in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/12/jane-fonda-slams-justin-trudeau-dont-fooled-good-looking-liberals/|title=Jane Fonda slams Justin Trudeau: 'Don't be fooled by good-looking liberals'|publisher=The Telegraph|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
[[File:Jane Fonda 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=.60|left|Jane Fonda at a book signing, 2005]]
On April 5, 2005, [[Random House]] released Fonda's autobiography ''My Life So Far''.  The book describes her life as a series of three acts, each thirty years long, and declares that her third "act" will be her most significant, partly because of her commitment to the Christian religion, and that it will determine the things for which she will be remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=My life so far|url={{Google books|3w5lAAAAMAAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|publisher=Random House|year=2005|ISBN=978-1-588-36478-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fonda's autobiography was well received by book critics and noted to be "as beguiling and as maddening as Jane Fonda herself" in its ''[[Washington Post]]'' review, calling her a "beautiful bundle of contradictions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=First Person, Singular |first=Jonathan |last=Yardley |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26664-2005Apr4.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the book "achingly poignant".&lt;ref name="nytreview"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/books/review/24DOWDL.html|title={{'-}}My Life So Far': The Roles of a Lifetime|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|date=April 24, 2005|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Fonda started chronicling her Broadway return in a blog with posts about topics ranging from her Pilates class to fears and excitement about her new play. She uses [[Twitter]] and has a [[Facebook]] page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marianne Schnall|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marianne-schnall/jane-fonda-on-joining-the_b_179773.html|title=Jane Fonda on Joining the Blogosphere|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=March 27, 2009|accessdate=April 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Fonda published a new book: ''Prime Time: Love, health, sex, fitness, friendship, spirit ‚Äì making the most of all of your life''. It offers stories from her own life as well as from the lives of others, giving her perspective on how to better live what she calls "the critical years from 45 and 50, and especially from 60 and beyond".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Time-fitness-friendship-spirit--making/dp/1400066972/ Amazon.com], ''Prime Time'', August 2011, Random House; {{ISBN|1-4000-6697-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable work==

{{anchor|#Charitable work}}&lt;!--Anchor preserves inbound link from [[Jane Fonda Foundation]] even if this section is renamed--&gt;Fonda's charitable works have focused on youth and education, adolescent reproductive health, environment, human services, and the arts.

Fonda marketed her highly-successful line of exercise videos and books in order to fund the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a California lobbying organization she founded with her second husband Tom Hayden in 1978.&lt;ref name="Late Show with Stephen Colbert"/&gt;

Fonda has established the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power and Potential (GCAPP) in the mid 1990s and the Fonda Family Foundation in the late 1990s.  In the mid 2000s, Fonda founded the Jane Fonda Foundation in 2004 with one million dollars of her own money as a charitable corporation with herself as president, chair, director and secretary; Fonda contributes 10 hours each week on its behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/policysocial-context/23387-jane-fonda-foundation-targeted-by-the-smoking-gun.html Jane Fonda Foundation Targeted by The Smoking Gun]; NPQ; December 16, 2013; accessed February 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janefonda.com/answering-attacks-on-my-credibility-as-a-philanthropist/ Answering Attacks on my Credibility as a Philanthropist]; ''JaneFonda.com''; December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2016/10/12/jane-fondas-philanthropy-a-hollywood-legend-keys-in-on-repro.html Jane Fonda's Philanthropy: A Hollywood Legend Keys in on Reproductive Health]; ''[[Inside Philanthropy]]''; Ade Adeniji; October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/glitzy-giving/jane-fonda.html Guide to Top Funders]; ''[[Inside Philanthropy]]''; 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, she began selling merchandise featuring her 1970 arrest mugshot on her website, the proceeds of which benefit GCAPP.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jane-fonda-is-selling-merchandise-with-her-1970-mugshot-on-it_us_58cbe76ae4b0be71dcf40329| title=Jane Fonda is Selling Merchandise With Her 1970 Mugshot On It| author=Alanna Vagianos| publisher=Huffington Post| date=2017-03-17| access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roger Vadim and Jane Fonda (Rome, 1967).jpg|thumb|Fonda and her first husband [[Roger Vadim]] in Rome in 1967 during the filming of ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]''.]]
Jane Fonda has been married and divorced three times.

Fonda married her first husband, French film director [[Roger Vadim]], on August 14, 1965 at the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes Hotel]] in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Jane Fonda Marries Frenchman|work= [[The Miami News]] | date=August 14, 1965|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K7gyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AOsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4338,4161089}}{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had a daughter, Vanessa Vadim, born on September 28, 1968 in Paris, France and named after the actress and activist [[Vanessa Redgrave]].&lt;ref&gt;Fonda, 2005, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faith===
Fonda grew up [[Atheism|atheist]] but turned to [[Christianity]] in the early 2000s. She describes her beliefs as being "outside of established religion" with a more feminist slant, and views [[God]] as something that "lives within each of us as Spirit (or soul)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janefonda.com/about-my-faith/|title=About My Faith|publisher=Janefonda.com|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She practices [[Zazen]] meditation and [[Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janefonda.com/upaya-zen-center-retreat/|title=Upaya Zen Center Retreat|publisher=Janefonda.com|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janefonda.com/new-years-resolution/|title=New Year's Resolution|publisher=Janefonda.com|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
As a child, Fonda suffered from a poor self-image and lack of confidence in her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father [[Henry Fonda]]. On the subject, Fonda said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was raised in the '50s. I was taught by my father [actor Henry Fonda] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother [[Frances Ford Seymour]] who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from [[bulimia]], the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout ... I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/eating-disorders/0809/jane-fonda-opens-up-about-her-decades-long-battle-with-bulimia.aspx|title=Jane Fonda Opens Up About Her Decades-Long Battle with Bulimia|publisher=Every Day Health|date=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lennyletter.com/politics/news/a311/my-convoluted-journey-to-feminism|title=My Convoluted Journey to Feminism|publisher=Lenny Letter|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been diagnosed with [[breast cancer]], Fonda underwent a [[lumpectomy]] in November 2010, and has recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/8130804/Jane-Fonda-suffers-breast-cancer-scare.html "Jane Fonda suffers &amp;#91;from&amp;#93; breast cancer"].

'''''Jupiter and Antiope''''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Jupiter et Antiope'') is an oil painting by the French artist [[Antoine Watteau]]. It is also known as the '''''Satyr and the Sleeping Nymph''''' and was probably painted between 1714 and 1719. Intended to be [[overdoor|placed over a doorway]], today it hangs in the [[Mus√©e du Louvre|Louvre]] in Paris.

== Description ==
The painting is oval shaped, with a width of 107.5&amp;nbsp;cm and a height of 73&amp;nbsp;cm. In the foreground it depicts the naked, sleeping [[Antiope (mother of Amphion)|Antiope]]. She lies with her head on the left edge of the painting, twisted so that her front side faces the viewer. Her right arm is bent under her head while her left arm hangs down into the abyss in front of her. This arm covers the right breast, while the left remains free. Her legs are bent up towards the viewer, with the right continuing the line of her body at the knee while her left leg is only slightly bent to point back to the lower right of the painting. The whole body is painted in pale, warm colours and lights up the otherwise dark and earthy image. Under the sleeping woman there is a cloth, which hangs over the abyss near her breast, disappears under her arm near her head and is lifted by the satyr behind her.
[[File:Watteau Jupiter und Antiope Detail.jpg|thumb|''Jupiter and Antiope'', detail]]

The [[satyr]], whose head is crowned with grape vines symbolising the presence of the god [[Bacchus]]. lies in the opposite direction behind the woman, with the front of his body also facing the viewer. With his left arm he lifts the cloth to the height of Antiope's shoulder and it is obvious that he has just uncovered the sleeping maiden. His left arm is bent on a tree root at the right edge of the image and props up his upper body. With his head and upper body, the satyr looms over the hips of the sleeper in order to gaze upon her - he licks his lips lustfully. His body is shadowy and cannot be made out below his hips. The satyr is depicted in brown tones. His suntanned skin and muscular body forms a clear contrast with the softly worked, shapely Antiope.

The lower edge of the image is taken up by an abyss, which is depicted in dark brown tones and is edged with bare soil. On either side, gnarled roots grow in the soil, which rise into indistinct trees. The ground continues above the trees into the background, where there is a hill with lone houses. Above that is the cloudy sky, discreetly lit by the glow of [[twilight]].

The composition fits the oval shape of the image. The sleeping Antiope forms the central horizontal, with her hips and bent legs creating the central vertical. The arms of the satyr and the legs of the woman curve in parallel with the upper edge of the painting - in this way the two central characters repeat the oval within the image, which is broken only by dangling left arm of the woman. Spatial depth is created by the stooped posture of Jupiter and by the bent knees of Antiope.

== Mythological background and reception in art ==
{{main article|Jupiter and Antiope}}
[[File:V√©nus_et_l'Amour_d√©couverts_par_un_satyre,_Corr√®ge_(Louvre_INV_42)_02.jpg|thumb|[[Correggio]], ''[[Venus and Cupid with a Satyr|Jupiter and Antiope]]'' (with Eros), c.1528]]

The painting comes out of the story of the seduction of Antiope by the god [[Zeus]] in [[Greek mythology]], later imported into [[Roman mythology]] and told of the god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. According to this myth, Antiope, the beautiful daughter of King [[Nycteus]] of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], was surprised and seduced by Zeus in the form of a satyr. She became pregnant and bore the twins [[Amphion and Zethus]], who later killed Nycteus' brother [[Lycus (brother of Nycteus)|Lycus]] in revenge for his treatment of Antiope and took over the city of Thebes.

=== Satyr and Nymph ===
[[File:Carracci Le Satyre et la Nymphe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Agostino Carracci]]: ''[[I Modi|Le Satyre et la Nymphe]]'']]
Satyrs and nymphs form two extremes in Greek mythology, which are united only by their instinctive natures. While the nymph was the source of the psychological term [[nymphomania]] (now [[hypersexuality]]), the satyr was the source of the once common but now outdated term [[satyriasis]] and can be understood as the nymph's male equivalent.

Accordingly, both nymphs and saturs are very regularly depicted in mythology - and thence also in their subsequent artistic reception - in erotic contexts and are accordingly favoured topics of art. In addition there is a clear aesthetic contrast between the two stereotypes. The nymph is in general very beautiful and physically perfect. They were mostly depicted with ivory, light and very delicate colours and an idealised female form, having close similarities with depictions of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. On the other hand, the satyrs, who are the followers of Bacchus, are very ugly, with the horns, legs and sometimes the tail of a goat. They are also strong, muscular, and tanned. Thus nymphs and satyrs present an optical contrast, which could hardly be any stronger and which makes them a perfect pair for artistic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Section derived from [[Eva Gesine Baur]], ''Meisterwerke der erotischen Kunst.'' Dumont Verlag, K√∂ln 1995, pp. 58‚Äì64. {{ISBN|3-7701-3599-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation and context ==
[[File:Watteau Jupiter Skizze.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of ''Jupiter and Antiope'' with standing Satyr]]
The circumstances of the painting's creation are not entirely clear (see below). In the art historical literature, the assumption that the painting was created as a commission for the banker [[Pierre Crozat]] under the instruction of Watteau's teacher [[Charles de La Fosse]] around the time of the creation of the four ''Seasons'' prevails. La Fosse encouraged Watteau who had not practiced [[history painting]] hitherto to take on the work of the allegories of the ''Seasons'', since he himself was not in the neighbourhood anymore. The ''Seasons'' seem to have been designed as oval paintings with mythological scenes intended to decorate Crozat's dining room.
[[File:Watteau Fr√ºhling.jpg|thumb|''Spring'', one of the ''Seasons'']]

In parallel with this series, Watteau produced a range of other paintings, which dealt with the theme of the mythological nude in this same oval format which was at that time unusual. At first he painted a number of historical images in the classical format, following Italian and Netherlandish classics, after which he next created ''Jupiter and Antiope'', the seasons and three further seasons in the oval format: another ''Autumn'', ''Venus Disarming Amor'' and the ''Morning Toilette''.

Models for the painting of ''Jupiter and Antiope'' included the paintings of the same name by [[Antonio da Correggio]] and [[Titian]] as well as the ''Descent from the Cross'' of the Dutch painter [[Anthonis van Dyck]], from which the arrangement of the satyr's arms is taken.
[[File:Watteau Champs Elysees Ausschnitt.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from ''The Elysian Fields'', c.1719]]

During his preparation for the ''Jupiter and Antiope'', at least three sketches were created by Watteau, in which he attempted to work the satyr out. These include a drawing of the satyr in standing position and one in the reclining pose which he finally selected. No sketches of Antiope are known, but Watteau had already produced a great number of female nudes and studies which he could draw on for this painting. Finally, an image now lost showed the whole image and was used by the engraver [[Anne Claude de Caylus|Anne-Claude-Philippe, Comte de Caylus]] as model for a [[Chalcography|copper engraving]] which was first published by [[Jules de Jullienne]].

Watteau returned to the theme of the sleeping nymph in his 1719 painting ''The Elysian Fields'', a scene of the gardens of the [[Champs-√âlys√©es]] in [[Paris]]. Here he depicted a stone copy of Antiope wearing a crown as a monument on the pedestal at the right hand side of the painting, as a kind of "living sculpture" which is typical of Watteau.&lt;ref&gt;according to Grasselli, Rosenberg 1985&lt;/ref&gt; This statue is placed directly above a gallantly dressed man seen only from behind ([[Hagestolz]]) who considers the scenery as part of a group of men in the foreground (Watteau also painted a similar group of people in the ''Rural Pleasure'' of 1720, in that case standing under a statue of Venus). According to B√∂rsch-Supan, the Hagestolz represents the natural counterpoint to the lustful satyr - he observes the figure on the pedestal with particular interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helmut B√∂rsch-Supan]]: ''Antoine Watteau 1684‚Äì1721.'' K√∂nemann Verlagsgesellschaft, K√∂ln 2000; pp. 95 and 98. {{ISBN|3-8290-1630-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provenance ==
The history of the painting after its creation is not yet completely clear and in particular its location before 1857 remains an open question.

Probably Watteau painted the image as a commission for the merchant Pierre Crozat, for whom he also produced the series of ''Seasons'' painted at the same time. This is claimed in an exhibition catalogue from [[Vienna]] in 1966 and remains the most widely accepted theory in art history to this day, but it still cannot be proven.

In 1857 the painting appeared at the auction of the collection of [[Theodore Patureau]] in a catalogue in which it was listed as a former possession of Prince [[Paul d'Arenberg]]. Watteau maintained a friendly relationship with the ancestors of the prince in the early eighteenth century and a receipt of 14 May 1717 signed by Watteau records that he had sold two paintings to [[L√©opold Philippe d'Arenberg]]. In their 1929 book ''Jean de Juliennes et les graveurs de Watteau au XVIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; si√®cle'' E. H√©rold and A. Vuaflart suggest that ''Jupiter and Antiope'' could have been one of these two paintings and develop a theory that de Ligne ordered the painting in 1714 during a trip to Paris and returned to collect the painting and pay for it three years later.&lt;ref&gt;E. H√©rold and A. Vuaflart: ''Jean de Juliennes et les graveurs de Watteau au XVIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; si√®cle.'' Vol. 1: ''Notices et documents biographique.'' Paris 1929; followed by Graselli and Rosenberg 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Today this theory is largely rejected.

How the painting came into the possession of Paturae is no longer clear either, but he probably bought it from Price Paul d'Arenberg privately. In 1864 the Baron [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] bought the painting and then put it up for auction again in March 1868 through the art-dealer [[Bourlon de Sarty]]. It was bought by [[Louis La Caze]] who died the very next year, leaving it to the [[Louvre]]. The painting still hangs there today.&lt;ref&gt;Provenance per Graselli and Rosenberg 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation status and alterations ===
The conservation status of the painting is relatively poor. With the help of [[X ray]] imaging cracked areas were restored, particularly in the sky and around the edges. Further investigations revealed that Antiope originally wore a cloth of modesty which was later removed. Whether the cloth and its subsequent removal were painted by Watteau himself is not clear. A later addition and removal is also possible. The X-ray imagery and especially Watteau's sketches and the copper engraving of Watteau's contemporary the Comte de Caylus confirm that the satyr was painted by Watteau, which was once controversial. The old theory that the final private owner, Louis La Caze had made alterations to the painting can also now be considered disproven.

== Copies ==
After its creation ''Jupiter and Antiope'' was repeatedly copied and reworked. Two copies by an unknown artist are preserved in the Louvre in the ''Service d‚ÄôEtudes et de Documentation''.

The previously mentioned copper engraving of the Comte de Caylus was created in the lifetime of Watteau and was included in [[Jean de Jullienne]]'s collection ''Figures de diff√©rents caract√®res''.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Roland Michel. ''Watteau.'' Prestel Verlag, M√ºnchen ‚Äì 1984; {{ISBN|3-7913-0681-2}}; Seiten 294‚Äì296&lt;/ref&gt; He based his depiction not on the painting itself, but like most of his engravings on a drawing by Watteau which is now lost. A drawing of the painting by [[Gabriel de Saint-Aubin]] also existed which is today on display in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].

The French painter [[Lucien L√©vy-Dhurmer]] painted an invented ''View of Watteau's Studio'' in 1890, in which the ''Jupiter and Antiope'' features as one of the paintings on the walls. Another painting in which the painting appears as part of the composition is the ''Salle La Caze'' painted by [[√âdouard Vuillard]] in 1922. [[Ernest Laurent]] copied the image as a [[grisaille]] and a free modern interpretation was made by [[Claude Schurr]] in 1966.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Watteau Jupiter und Antiope Detail 2.jpg|thumb|Detail on which the cover of ''Das Parfum'' was based]]
[[Patrick S√ºskind]]'s novel ''[[Perfume (novel)|Perfume]]'' published by [[Diogenes Verlag]] since 1985 has a detail from ''Jupiter and Antiope'' on the cover with the [[armpit]] of the naked sleeper in the centre. This might symbolise the novel's central theme of fragrant seduction. The novel was an international best seller, translated into 46 languages, with 15 million copies sold. The same image has been used on all versions of the cover except the American paperback edition (where it was prohibited to depict a women's nipple), thus the book has made Watteau's Antiope famous worldwide.

In July 1971 [[Paraguay]] produced a [[postage stamp]] with the motif of the sleeping nymph.

The '''Kachchhapaghatas''' ([[IAST]]: KacchapaghƒÅta) were an Indian dynasty that ruled between 10th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref name="TSP_ASI_Kadwaha"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tspasibhopal.nic.in/project/expl_Khadwaha_Ashok_nagar_mp_2009_10/temple_of_kadwaha.html |title=Exploration Of Kadwaha, District Ashoknagar, Madhya Pradesh (2009-2010) |publisher=Archaeological Survey of India (Temple Survey Project) |location=Bhopal |accessdate=9 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their territory included north-western parts of Central India (present-day [[Madhya Pradesh]]).&lt;ref name="Rahman_2012"/&gt;

== History ==

The Sanskrit word ''Kachchhapa-ghata'' (‡§ï‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§™‡§ò‡§æ‡§§) literally means "tortoise killer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Henry Miers Elliot]] |title=Memoirs on the History, Folk-Lore, and Distribution of the Races of the North Western Provinces of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-lAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA158 |year=1869 |publisher=Tr√ºbner &amp; co.|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kachchhapaghatas were originally the vassals of the [[Pratihara]]s and the [[Chandela]]s.{{sfn|Ahmed Ali|2005|p=2}} After the death of the Chandela king [[Vidyadhara (Chandela king)|Vidyadhara]], the Chandela kingdom was weakened by repeated Muslim ([[Yamini dynasty|Yamini]]) invasions. Taking advantage of this situation, the Kachchhapaghatas gave up their allegiance to the Chandelas.{{sfn|Sailendra Nath Sen|1999|p=311}} They became powerful towards the end of the 10th century.{{sfn|Ahmed Ali|2005|p=2}}

A [[Sasbahu Temple, Gwalior|Sasbahu temple]] inscription suggests that Lakshmana was the first prominent member of the dynasty. This inscription, as well as a 977 Sihoniya inscription state that his successor Vajradaman captured Gopadri (Gwalior) from the king of Gadhinagara, that is the [[Pratihara dynasty|Pratihara]] ruler of [[Kannauj]].{{sfn|Kalyan Kumar Chakravarty|1984|p=91}} Vajradaman, described as the ''[[tilaka]]'' of the dynasty in Gwalior inscriptions dated 1093-94 and 1104, was probably the first powerful ruler of the dynasty. He served as a feudatory to the Chandela kings [[Dhanga]] and [[Vidyadhara (Chandela king)|Vidyadhara]].&lt;ref name="Rahman_2012"/&gt;

The dynasty was divided into three branches, which ruled from [[Gwalior]] (GopƒÅdrigiri), Dubkunda (Cha·πádobha), and [[Narwar]] (Nalapur).{{sfn|Ahmed Ali|2005|p=2}} Virasimha (also Virasimharama or Virasimhadeva), a Kachchhapaghata ruler of Nalapura, issued a copper plate grant in 1120-21. This record describes him using the high-status royal title ''[[Maharajadhiraja]]''. Gold coins issued by him have also been discovered.{{sfn|P. C. Roy|1980|pp=71-72}}

=== Downfall ===

According to bardic tradition, the last ruler of the dynasty was Tejaskarana (alias Dulha Rai or Dhola Rai), the hero of the  romantic tale ''[[Dhola Maru]]''. This account states that he left Gwalior in 1128 to marry the daughter of a neighbouring ruler, after leaving Paramal-dev (or Paramardi-dev) in-charge of the Gwalior fort. When he returned to Gwalior, Paramal refused to hand over the fort to him, and founded the Parihara dynasty which ruled Gwalior for 103 years. The Parihara ruler over Gwalior is also attested the 1150 inscription of Ramdeo and 1194 inscription of Lohanga-Deva.{{sfn|Mysore Ramsharma|p=134}} However, other inscriptions suggest that the Kachchhapaghatas ruled the area at least until 1155 CE.{{sfn|Mysore Ramsharma|p=133}} In addition, 1192 and 1194 inscriptions found at Gwalior show that the Kachchhapaghata ruler Ajayapala controlled Gwalior in the later years as well.{{sfn|Mysore Ramsharma|p=134}} Thus, the bardic account is not completely reliable, and the Parihara chiefs probably ruled Gwalior as feudatories of the Kachchhapaghatas.{{sfn|Mysore Ramsharma|p=134}}

Sulakshanapala, the last ruler of the dynasty, appears to have lost his kingdom to a [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurid]] invasion. The ''[[Tajul-Ma'asir]]'' suggests the Ghurid general [[Qutb al-Din Aibak]] invaded Gwalior in 1196, and extracted tribute from Sulakshanapala (whom ''Tajul-Ma'asir'' labels Solankhapala of Parihar family). The Ghurids took over the fort in the later years, and Qutb al-Din's son [[Iltutmish]] became its governor.{{sfn|Kalyan Kumar Chakravarty|1984|p=91}}

The bardic accounts such as ''Dhola Maru'' suggest that the [[Kachwaha]] dynasty of [[Amber, India|Amber]] originated from the Tejaskarana, the last ruler of the Narwar branch of the Kachchhapaghata dynasty.{{sfn|Kalyan Kumar Ganguli|1983|p=196}} However, the Kachwaha inscriptions claim a different origin for their dynasty.{{sfn|V. S. Bhatnagar|1974|p=4}}

'''Koh e Hindu''' ({{lang-fa| ⁄©ŸàŸá ŸáŸÜÿØŸà }} ''Mountain of the Hindu'') is a mountain of the [[Hindu Kush]] in Afghanistan. It is located in near [[Shakardara District]] and [[Mir Bacha Kot District]], [[Kabul Province]].

==Importance for Hindus==
For Hindus, in ancient times, for example, in pre-Islamic times, when even the name Afghanistan was not, but then the mountains of Hindus have for residents with Hindu religious denominations in the Iranian plateau (eastern) enormous importance. The Islamization of the  ''Iranzamin'' or [[Aryana]] or [[Ariana]] in the east began to eleventh century. There are still some names with the religious terminology of Hinduism that the times of Hinduism, for example, [[Hindu Shahi]] dynasties  in ''Kah pol'' ({{lang-fa|  ⁄©ÿßŸá ŸæŸÑ}} '' Haulm- Bridge'' for [[Kabul]])&lt;ref&gt;folk mythology humorous&lt;/ref&gt;  or [[Kabulistan]] and [[Zabulistan]] are due. The Hindu have had their sanctities two thousands mountains. Especially in Kabul and Parwan existed several of terms that refer to Hindus and ''Hindu Kush'' in the Meaning of ''Hindu Happy''. Here were and are also the most Hindu temples of the country.

Hinduism was one of the first religions of Asia like Zoroastrianism and Buddhism. Buddhism originated in India and he came from India to this region. Otherwise, the present territory was a stronghold of Indian, Iranian and Turkic cultures. Alone in the food and customs can be seen in this room Chinese, Turanian, Iranian and Indian ways of life. The River of Kabul and the other rivers of the Hindu Kush have been praised in Vedic and Avestan hymns, especially the eastern and southern watersheds of the Hindu Kush, the western sources of the Indus (Sindh).

== Koh, Kuh, √ßiya,  Kash, c≈ç·π≠ƒ´ ==
''Koh'' (eastern sound of Persian)  or ''Kuh'' (western  sound) ({{lang-fa| ⁄©ŸàŸá  }}) or serval words with sound change,  mean in all indo-Iranian linguages ''mountain'' or refer to mountains. ''‡§ö‡•ã‡§ü‡•Ä'' (''c≈ç·π≠ƒ´'' or ''Kuta'') and ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ (''DarrƒÅ'') and ‡§ï‡•Ç‡§§‡§≤ (K≈´tala), ''Lutke'' are the words of [[Sanskrit]]/Hindi/Urdu/Persian/Kurdi, Balochi/Pashto, that mean ''top'' or ''Summit of mouantain'' or ''mountain pass'' or ''valley'' (dale).

'''Lake Ronkonkoma''', Long Island's largest freshwater lake, is in [[Suffolk County, NY|Suffolk County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States, and has a circumference of about {{convert|2|mi|km}}, and is {{convert|0.65|mi|km}} across on average.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?q=ronkonkoma%20lake%20&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl Lake Ronkonkoma (Google Maps)]&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Kettle (landform)|kettle]] lake formed by retreating glaciers, it is owned by the Town of Islip under the terms of the Nichols Patent. The land around it is controlled by three town governments - [[Smithtown, New York|Smithtown]], [[Islip (town), New York|Islip]] and [[Brookhaven, New York|Brookhaven]]. The separation originated because three different Native American communities claimed lands on different shores, and these claims continued when the tribes gave separate deeds to the land under their control. The name Ronkonkoma comes from an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] expression meaning "boundary fishing-lake", also earlier written as Raconkumake and Raconkamuck.&lt;ref&gt;Bright, William (2007). ''Native American placenames of the United States''. Bright University of Oklahoma Press. p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
[[File:Lake Ronkonkoma, New York (1901).jpg|thumb|right|North beach, 1901]]
Smithtown founder Richard Smith's original holdings included the headwaters of the [[Nissequogue River]] east to a "freshwater pond called Raconkamuck," which translates as "the boundary fishing place" in the Algonquian language. What is now known as Lake Ronkonkoma served as a boundary between lands occupied by four Native American communities: Nissequogues, Setaukets, Secatogues and Unkechaugs.

The Smithtown side of the lake was settled by the 1740s, but it was not until the late 1890s that the area gained widespread public attention. That's when boarding houses and hotels were erected to accommodate a growing number of tourists drawn by claims that the lake's waters had special healing powers. By the 1920s, beach pavilions had sprung up. The [[Long Island Rail Road]], which was completed to nearby [[Lakeland, Suffolk County, New York|Lakeland]] in 1842 (the depot was moved to [[Ronkonkoma, New York|Ronkonkoma]] in 1883), helped transform what had been a sleepy farming hamlet.

The Lake was created by a retreating glacier. Portions of its irregular basin are unusually deep for Long Island, but most of the lake is less than {{convert|15|ft|m}} deep. As a rule of thumb, it is unproductive to fish deeper than {{convert|15|ft|m}} in Lake Ronkonkoma because there is seldom enough dissolved oxygen to sustain fish beyond this depth.
The primary gamefish are [[Largemouth bass]] and [[smallmouth bass]].

Lake Ronkonkoma holds large [[bass (fish)|Bass]] but locating them is a challenge due to the scarcity of natural structure to attract these fish. Chain pickerel are extremely rare. In the last two decades, white perch and yellow perch populations have increased to the point of upsetting the ecological balance of the lake.
Maximum depth: {{convert|65|ft|m}}. Area: {{convert|243|acre|km2}}:

There have been unsubstantiated rumors of [[Piranha]] being caught in the lake over the past 2 decades. The idea that schools of piranha are ravaging the depths of Lake Ronkonkoma is unfounded and highly unlikely, as there undoubtedly would have been more attacks on bathers and more evidence of devoured fish. Actual specimens "caught" in the lake (or at least presented by people in a glass jar in the mid-1990s) have been either proven to have not come from the lake, or have been [[Pacu]], a different species that looks very similar but is harmless and has a limited presence in the lake. Bites that have been reported on feet and the lower body in shallow water are likely to have been caused by [[turtles]], which also have a moderately strong presence in the lake and may have a tendency to bite when threatened or irritated.

==Summer Resort==
Lake Ronkonkoma was a popular Long Island [[summer resort]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There were a few boarding houses in town. One of the hotels on the lake was the Lake Front Hotel situated on twenty-four acres of land on the lake's shore. Most of the original settlers and local residents chose to live away from the lakefront. The land one half mile or so beyond the lake was flatter and better suited for farming. Little by little, the lakefront developed into a fashionable haven for the wealthier people who had summer estates there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/history-of-ronkonkomas-details-3-population-waves-1.3380417 "History of Ronkonkomas details 3 population waves," by Erin Geismar (Newsday; December 10, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, the [[Long Island Motor Parkway]] was completed from Queens to Lake Ronkonkoma. Traveling the winding Motor Parkway to reach the lake in those days was an adventure in itself.

Lake Ronkonkoma became an exclusive summer enclave for the wealthy and famous from New York City. All summer long there was boating and swimming at the lake. While the area's population peaked during the summers, fall activities such as hunting were also popular, although hunting activity began to decline in the 1930s. During the winters, skating parties were often arranged. A favorite game on the ice was [[Crack the Whip]].

The perimeter of the lake itself began to change from residential to commercial usage. As the lake front become less exclusive, many longtime residents began to leave the area. In the 1950s, the original owners began to sell their beaches to others. George Raynor, whose family had lived at the lake since the 1840s, owned a parcel of land which later became Raynor Beach. Many of the beach front pavilions, which were left unattended, burned down. On October 4, 1962, Brookhaven Town purchased land for the first town-owned beach on the lake. The unattended sections of beaches began to deteriorate. Rubbish, tin cans and bottles lined the shores in many places. Since the [[shoreline]] lay in between three townships, no single entity was willing to take responsibility. A Tri-Town Committee for the Preservation of Lake Ronkonkoma has been formed. The committee has agreed that the three towns would treat the pollution problems as a single problem, affecting all of the [[Long Island]] residents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6491">{{Ancient Roman religion}}

The '''lectisternium''' was an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[Propitiation|propitiatory]] ceremony, consisting of a meal offered to gods and goddesses. The word derives from ''lectum sternere'', "to spread (or "drape") a couch."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], xii. 9, gives the Greek equivalent as œÉœÑœÅœâŒºŒΩŒ±ŒØ.&lt;/ref&gt;  The deities were represented by their busts or statues, or by portable figures of wood, with heads of bronze, wax or marble, and covered with drapery.  It has also been suggested{{By whom|date=May 2010}} that the divine images were bundles of sacred herbs tied together in the form of a head, covered by a waxen mask so as to resemble a kind of bust, rather like the straw figures called [[Argei]]. These figures were laid upon a couch (''lectus''), the left arm resting on a cushion (''pulvinus'', whence the couch itself was often called ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'') in the [[attitude (art)|attitude]] of reclining. The couch was set out in the open street, and a meal placed before it on a table.

==History==
[[Livy]] says&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 5.13.&lt;/ref&gt; that the ceremony took place "for the first time" in Rome in the year 399 BC, after a pestilence had caused the [[Sibylline Books]] to be consulted by the ''[[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|duumviri sacris faciundis]]'', the two (later 15) priestly officials who maintained the archive. Three couches were prepared for three pairs of gods ‚Äî [[Apollo]] and [[Leto|Latona]], [[Hercules]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Poseidon|Neptune]]. The feast lasted for eight (or seven) days, and was also celebrated by private individuals. The citizens kept open house, quarrels were forgotten, debtors and prisoners were released, and everything done to banish sorrow.

Similar honors were paid to other divinities in subsequent times: [[Fortuna (mythology)|Fortuna]], [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturnus]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] Regina of the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]], the three [[Capitoline Hill|Capitoline]] deities ([[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], Juno, [[Minerva]]). In 217 BC, after the [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Roman defeat at Lake Trasimene]], a lectisternium was held for three days to six pairs of gods, corresponding to the [[Twelve Olympians]] of [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religion]]: Jupiter, Juno, Neptune, Minerva, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], Apollo, Diana, [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], Mercury, [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]].

In 205 BC, alarmed by unfavorable [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#prodigium|prodigies]], the Romans were ordered to fetch the [[Magna Mater deorum Idaea|Great Mother of the gods]] from [[Pessinus]] in [[Phrygia]]; in the following year the image was brought to Rome, and a lectisternium held. In later times, the lectisternium became a constant  or even daily occurrence, celebrated in the different temples. Occasionally the "Draping of Couches" was part of [[Roman Triumph]] celebrations. [[Aulus Hirtius]] reports that Julius Caesar was greeted with "draped dining couches" following his victory in Gaul, in anticipation of a forthcoming triumph.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Hirtius, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Bellum Gallicum]]'' 8.51.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Such celebrations must be distinguished from those which were ordered, like the earlier lectisternia, by the Sibylline Books in special emergencies.

In the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]], chairs were substituted for couches in the case of goddesses, and the lectisternium in their case became a ''[[sellisternium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', xv. 44; the reading, however, is not certain.&lt;/ref&gt; This was in accordance with Roman custom, since in the earliest times all the members of a family sat at meals, and in later times at least the women and children. This is a point of distinction between the original practice at the lectisternium and the ''epulum Jovis'', the goddesses at the latter being provided with chairs, whereas in the lectisternium they reclined.

In Christian times the word was used for a feast in memory of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidonius Apollinaris]], ''Epistulae'', iv. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Offerings of food were made to the gods in very early Roman times on such occasions as the ceremony of ''[[confarreatio]]'', and the ''[[epulum Jovis]]'' (often confounded with the lectisternium). The lectisternia, however, are likely of Greek origin.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The Greek ''[[theoxenia]]'' (ŒòŒµŒøŒæŒ≠ŒΩŒπŒ±) is similar, except that the gods played the part of host. The gods associated with it were either previously unknown to Roman religion, though often concealed under Roman names, or were provided with a new cult. Thus Hercules was not worshipped as at the [[Ara Maxima]], where, according to [[Maurus Servius Honoratius|Servius]]&lt;ref&gt;Servius, note to ''[[Aeneid]]'', viii. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus (minor)|Cornelius Balbus]]&lt;ref&gt;As recorded by [[Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius|Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' iii. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; a lectisternium was forbidden. The Sibylline Books, which decided whether a lectisternium was to be held or not, were of Greek origin; the custom of reclining at meals was Greek.

Some, however, assign an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] origin to the ceremony, the Sibylline Books themselves being looked upon as old Italian "black books."{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} It may be that as the lectisternia became an almost everyday occurrence in Rome, people forgot their foreign origin and the circumstances in which they were first introduced, and then the word ''pulvinar'' with its associations was transferred to times in which it had no existence.{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

==Early life==
Dohan was born in [[Givatayim]], [[Israel]] and then raised in a small village near [[Ra'anana]]. She began studying acting at 13, and landed a spot in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] Entertainment Corps, later studying at [[Nissan Nativ]] [[drama school|acting school]].&lt;ref name="M&amp;C"/&gt; During her studies, she received [[scholarship]]s from the [[America Israel Cultural Foundation]]. In her first year of studies, she wrote, [[Theatre director|directed]], and acted in an original theatre movement production. During the second year of studies, she began working in a variety of television productions and performed in two feature films in her third year. Before graduating, Dohan had signed a contract with Israel's [[Cameri Theater]].&lt;ref name="IMFA"/&gt;

==Career==

===Acting===
Dohan graduated from Nissan Nativ in 1998, and joined two major theaters.&lt;ref name="Playbill"/&gt;  By 2000, she was voted 'Most Promising New Actress' for her work in ''Best Friends'', performed at the [[Cameri Theater]]. Since then, she has appeared in several other roles, including Juliet in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. In 2002, Dohan played a role in ''Bad Children'', a part that was written especially for her by the Israeli playwright [[Edna Mazya]].

==Theater==
Of her play ''Bath Party'', co-written with Karen Shefler and Ayelet Dekel, ''[[Village Voice]]'' praised Dohan's work in the play, writing "What saves the piece from being a purely wandering, aimless morass is the droll humor and keen comedic timing of Dohan and her associates. Dohan has a sharp wit and notable ability to find the unlikely joke". In speaking toward her work with her co-stars, they wrote "Their quick banter and easy back-and-forth are polished and at times charming, and together they make even the most disjointed material a pleasure to watch".&lt;ref name="Village Voice"&gt;{{cite news

| first=David |last=Kornhaber}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' also spoke well of ''Bath Party'', comparing Dohan to "a younger, prettier, blonder [[Rosanna Arquette]]", noting it as an essentially a one-woman show which "focuses on her not particularly interesting efforts to jump-start an American career, complete with film and television clips, circumlocutory monologues and, perhaps most important for this particular performer, multiple opportunities to reveal her appealing anatomy", and also praising the work of the few others in the cast.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news

Of Dohan's work in the [[Anthony Neilson]] play ''[[Anthony Neilson|Stitching]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote "With an actress as extremely gorgeous as Meital Dohan and a script that requires her to thrash around in ways most often seen in straight-to-video steamers, you would think that ''Stitching'' would be heating up the Wild Project theater to the boiling point." They found that it did not, blaming the Neilson script for working "so hard at being gimmicky that it doesn‚Äôt give Ms. Dohan and her co-star, Gian Murray Gianino, a chance to find real chemistry. No chemistry, no combustion."  They granted that the two leads "give energetic, bruise-inducing performances under [[Timothy Haskell]]‚Äôs direction", but that the script's manner of ricocheting "from comedy to pathos to psychosis without ever really providing the starting point that any play needs" placed too many demands on them.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news

It notes that even though the character has no lines in the film, she receives top billing.&lt;ref name="LATIMES1"/&gt;

Filmfare.com (19 December 2014). Retrieved 2015-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;}} film directed by [[Rajkumar Hirani]] and written by Hirani and [[Abhijat Joshi]]. It was jointly produced by Hirani and [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] under the banners Rajkumar Hirani Films and [[Vinod Chopra Films]] respectively. The film follows an alien who comes to Earth on a research mission, but loses his remote to a thief, who later sells it to a [[Godman (India)|godman]]. He befriends a television journalist and in his quest to retrieve the remote, questions religious dogmas and [[Superstition in India|superstitions]]. The film stars [[Aamir Khan]] in the titular role with [[Anushka Sharma]], [[Sushant Singh Rajput]], [[Boman Irani]], [[Saurabh Shukla]] and [[Sanjay Dutt]] in pivotal roles.

After the success of ''[[3 Idiots]]'' (2009), Hirani and Joshi's began scripting their next project; finding similarities with the plot of ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), they scrapped the film. It was later rewritten with a different angle and tone. During production, the film was first titled ''Talli'' and later ''Ek Tha Talli'' before being changed to ''PK'' as the latter title was found too similar to ''[[Ek Tha Tiger]]'' (2012). The film's soundtrack was composed by [[Shantanu Moitra]], [[Ajay‚àíAtul]] and [[Ankit Tiwari]] with lyrics written by [[Swanand Kirkire]], Amitabh Varma and Manoj Muntashir. [[UTV Motion Pictures]] acquired the distribution rights of the film.

''PK'' was released on 19 December 2014. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards the performances, particularly Khan, and its portrayal of superstitions. Criticism was focused on the [[Anti-Hindu sentiment]]. The film received eight nominations at the [[60th Filmfare Awards]], winning two. Additionally, it won five [[Producers Guild Film Awards]], and two [[Screen Awards]]. ''PK'' garnered the [[Telstra People's Choice Award]] at the [[Indian Film Festival of Melbourne]].

Produced on a budget of {{INR}}85 [[crore]], ''PK'' was the first Indian film to gross more than {{INR|link=yes}}7&amp;nbsp;billion and [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million worldwide. At the time, it emerged as the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian film of all time]], and ranks as the 70th highest-grossing film of 2014 worldwide. The film's final worldwide gross was {{INRConvert|800|c}}. It currently stands as the 5th highest grossing Indian film worldwide and 5th [[List of highest-grossing films in India|highest-grossing film in India]].

==Plot==
A humanoid [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] ([[Aamir Khan]]) lands on Earth naked on a research mission in [[Rajasthan]] but is stranded when the remote control for his spaceship is stolen. He manages to get the thief's cassette recorder. On the same day in [[Bruges]], an Indian Hindu woman Jaggu ([[Anushka Sharma]]) meets a Pakistani Muslim Sarfaraz ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]) and falls in love with him. Jaggu's father ([[Parikshit Sahni]]) objects to their relationship citing religious differences. He consults [[Godman (India)|godman]] Tapasvi Maharaj ([[Saurabh Shukla]]) who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her. At the wedding chapel, she is heartbroken when she receives an unsigned letter, believing it is from Sarfaraz, calling off the marriage due to cultural differences.

Jaggu returns to India and becomes a TV reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the "missing" God. She saves him when he attempts to take money from a collection box, earning his trust. The alien tells her that he is a researcher from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing, religion, or verbal communication. They transfer ideas by holding hands. The alien learned to fit in with humans by wearing clothes and using money stolen from "dancing cars".

In a flashback, after being accidentally hit by a truck, the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), who takes him along with his troop. Bhairon takes him to a [[brothel]], where the alien holds a prostitute's ([[Reema Debnath]]) hand for six hours and thus learns the [[Bhojpuri language]]. Bhairon suggests him that his thief may be in Delhi. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behavior, people assume he is drunk and calls him "peekay" (Hindi for drunk). The alien names himself PK. People tell him that only "God" can help him find his remote. PK sincerely practices [[Religion in India|Indian religions]] attempting to find "God", to no avail. He later discovers that Tapasvi has his remote, who claims it was a gift from God and refuses to return it. Jaggu promises PK that she will recover his remote and he can go back home.

PK conjectures that Tapasvi and other godmen must be dialling a "wrong number" to communicate with God and are advising the public to engage in meaningless rituals. Jaggu encourages the public to expose [[Pious fraud|fraudulent godmen]], by sending their videos to her news channel. This "wrong number" campaign turns into a popular mass-movement, to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief and contacts PK, telling him that he sold his remote control to Tapasvi. PK realises that Tapasvi was a fraud all along and that it was not a "wrong number". Bhairon informs him that they will come to Delhi, but both die in a terrorist attack. The attack is later declared by Tapasvi's group to be stated as protecting their Gods.

Tapasvi decides to confront PK on-air. Tapasvi asks PK what the "right number" is. PK says that "God that created us all" is the only concept people should believe in and that the other "duplicate Gods" are artificial. Tapasvi argues, saying that PK is trying to take people away from their Gods and that they will not stand for their Gods being taken away. He claims he has a direct connection to God and refers to his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to try to prove that Muslims are liars. PK, having absorbed Jaggu's memories earlier, realizes that Sarfaraz did not write the letter to Jaggu.

Jaggu contacts the [[List of diplomatic missions of Pakistan#Europe|Pakistani Embassy]] in Belgium where Sarfaraz worked part-time. The embassy tells her that Sarfaraz still loves her, and is now living in [[Lahore]]. Jaggu and Sarfaraz reconnect, and Tapasvi is forced to return PK's remote. Meanwhile, PK has fallen in love with Jaggu but refrains from telling her because she loves Sarfaraz. Having filled multiple audio tapes with her voice alone, he takes two suitcases full of tapes and extra batteries when leaving for home. After his departure, Jaggu publishes a book about him.

One year later, PK returns to Earth on a new research mission on human nature with several other members of his species (including one played by [[Ranbir Kapoor]]) .

After the success of ''[[3 Idiots]]'', director Rajkumar Hirani and writer Abhijat Joshi started work for the next project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/bollywood/aamir-hirani-and-vidhu-vinod-chopra-to-team-up-again_108538.html |title=Aamir, Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra to team up again |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2016 |publisher=[[Zee News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had written a story about a character who had the ability to get into another person‚Äôs mind to make that person a better human being. They spent one year to write a story, but it turned out to be similar to ''[[Inception]]''. After watching ''Inception'', Hirani and Joshi were shocked by the similarities. Eventually, they decided to scrap the film, then Hirani and Joshi reworked on the script, changing the entire tone and angle. It took five years to make the film and three years to write it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://m.rediff.com/movies/report/rajkumar-hirani-i-am-really-nervous-with-pk/20141215.htm |title=Rajkumar Hirani: I am really nervous with PK |date=15 December 2014 |accessdate=24 January 2016 |publisher=[[Rediff]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''PK'', Khan played nine avatars and, during the course of the film, the actor had to chew over 10,000 [[betelnut]] preparations called ''[[paan]]''. Betelnut is a psychoactive stimulant used throughout Asia and characterized by its ability to stain users' mouths red.&lt;ref name="CNN Betelnut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/04/world/asia/myanmar-betel-nut-cancer/index.html|title=Nothing to smile about: Asia's deadly addiction to betel nuts - CNN.com|first=By Hilary Whiteman|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In real life ''paan'' is not a habit, I have it once in a while but for this film I chew ''paan'' for every scene. I would at times eat about 100 ''paans'' in a day. We had a ''paanwala'' [a ''paan'' maker] on the sets," said Khan in the report. For every take, Khan had to eat a fresh ''paan'' to fill his mouth. Before beginning the shoot, he would eat at least 10‚Äì15 ''paans'' to get the right color inside his mouth and on his lips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Aamir-Khan-PK-is-the-toughest-role-of-my-career/articleshow/44923032.cms |title=Aamir Khan: PK is the toughest role of my career |date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=21 January 2016 |website=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viral Thakkar was the visual effects supervisor.

===Casting===

===Characters===
* '''PK''': The titular character was written to be a Chaplinesque, bumbling alien and meant to provide an outside view to the quirks and hypocrisies of the Indian society. To further accentuate the alien look, Khan developed a distinct appearance and mannerisms including wearing green contact lenses and not blinking while talking. Khan learned [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] for the role&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Aamir-Khan-and-his-Bhojpuri-teacher-inseparable-for-two-years/articleshow/44885457.cms|title=Aamir Khan and his Bhojpuri teacher, inseparable for two years ‚Äì Times of India|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the help of the language expert Shanti Bhushan. Rajkumar Hirani said in an interview, "When we write a script we usually visualize the characters in the film. How they look, talk and walk. But PK is one such character which was very difficult to visualize. We didn‚Äôt have a reference point. PK was one such character, who didn‚Äôt have a reference point. A character like him wasn‚Äôt there in any book, nor did we meet someone like him in real life. We only knew that we wanted the character to be innocent and child-like. Now the question was, who is that actor who could look like a Child. Someone who is perfect for the role of PK. The answer was obvious ‚Äì Aamir Khan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.desiretrees.com/aamir-khan-making-of-pk-the-character-behind-the-scenes/ |title= Rajkumar Hirani ‚Äì Aamir Khan Making of PK The Character |date=14 December 2014 |accessdate=24 January 2016 |publisher=Desiretrees}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Jagat "Jaggu" Janini''': PK's friend and confidante, 'Jaggu' is a television news reporter and is instrumental in spreading PK's message. She was envisioned as a fun-loving yet mature and independent woman. The producers wanted a distinct look for Jaggu and ended up trying several options over a few days before settling on one. Anushka said in an interview "Raju Sir wanted me to look happy, chirpy and peppy in ‚ÄòPK‚Äô. Keeping his brief in mind, the team came up with this look." She also reveals she was not required to cut her hair to get the look. "I have long hair, so hair stylists just wrapped my hair and tucked inside the wig".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mdaily.bhaskar.com/news/ENT-making-of-jagat-janani-anushka-reveals-the-secrets-behind-her-pk-characte-4843144-PHO.html?referrer_url |title=Making of Jagat Janani: Anushka Sharma reveals the secrets behind her ‚ÄòPK‚Äô character |date=18 December 2014 |accessdate=24 January 2016 |publisher=Daily Bhaskar.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bhairon Singh''': Makers wanted somebody tall and sturdy for the role of Bhairon Singh and that's why Sanjay came in the picture. Vidhu Vinod Chopra reveals, "The character Bhairon Singh is shown to be PK‚Äôs good friend. The idea was that since PK is a tiny person, we wanted someone who in contrast is very huge. Such that, when Bhairon hugs PK, it looks funny as the tiny man would go completely unnoticed in Bhairon‚Äôs arms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mdaily.bhaskar.com/news/ENT-making-of-bhairon-singh-rajkumar-hirani-reveals-the-secret-behind-sanjay-dutts-c-4841913-PHO.html |title=Bhairon Singh: Rajkumar Hirani reveals the secret behind Sanjay Dutt‚Äôs character in ‚ÄòPK‚Äô |date=18 December 2014 |accessdate=24 January 2016 |publisher=Daily Bhaskar.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title===
In 2011, in its initial scripting stage, Rajkumar Hirani named the film 'Talli', then changed it to 'Ek Tha Talli' which he loved but later on came to know that 'Ek Tha Tiger' was already in production (released in 2012). He dropped the idea and, after many titles, he came up with a title that only had initials, 'PK'. After starting the film, Hirani felt PK was not a good enough title. He decided to change the title to 'Talli'. But after a few weeks of shooting, Hirani decided to go back to the original title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://m.mid-day.com/articles/find-out-why-rajkumar-hirani-took-5-years-to-make-pk/15764191 |title= Find out why Rajkumar Hirani took 5 years to make 'pk' |date=14 November 2014 |accessdate=24 January 2016 |publisher=[[Mid-Day]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
[[Firstpost]] compared ''PK'' to Hirani and Khan's previous collaboration ''3 Idiots'' (2009), as they both involve "A socially awkward and 'different' young man‚Äîwho walks and talks in a strange, enthusiastic childlike manner‚Äîobserves the system, questions it, asks you to look at the many ludicrous things that inform it, and eventually brings about a minor revolution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/pk-review-alien-aamir-peppy-anushka-in-a-funny-but-flawed-satire-1857433.html PK review: 'Alien' Aamir, peppy Anushka in a funny but flawed satire].

In August the makers found a new promotional strategy to interact with the audiences by introducing talking standees. This was the first time a Bollywood film used a talking standee at varied locations as a part of its promotions. The standee had Aamir Khan talking to people in a prominent places in popular theatres and multiplexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://m.ibtimes.co.in/p-k-promotion-aamir-khan-interact-audience-theatres-605912 |title='P.K.'

On 7 December 2014, Aamir Khan began the city tour for promotions with Patna. The character he plays speaks in Bhojpuri which is the main language used for communication in Bihar. Aamir said at the event "I have decided to launch the promotional campaign of my film ‚ÄòPK‚Äô from Bihar to connect with the language. My character speaks Bhojpuri in the film." Hence, the actor decided to start his promotional schedule from Bihar. Although he wanted to visit Bhojpur, which is 60 kilometers from Bihar, he could not because of security issues. In Bihar he visited the Litti Chokha stall to try the authentic flavor of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Aamir-Khan-eats-litti-chokha-at-Patna-roadside-shop/articleshow/45400999.cms |title= Aamir Khan eats litti-chokha at Patna roadside shop |date=7 December 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2016 |website=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Litti Chokha stall owner has renamed his stall in Aamir‚Äôs name when he visited him last year, and Aamir couldn‚Äôt leave the city without visiting the stall again. Then the crew proceeded to Varanasi where they had a screening of their film ''[[3 Idiots]]'' and they interacted with the people one-to-one. Aamir Khan made an impromptu visit to Krishana Paan shop to savor a Banarasi pan. The actor specially removed time from his schedule to visit this place. He enjoyed a "mitha banarasi paan" there. After the crew visited Delhi, Ahemdabad, Raipur, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Indore, Bangalore and other locations in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-aamir-khan-starts-his-pk-promotions-from-bihar-2041865 |title=Aamir Khan starts his 'PK' promotions from Bihar |date=7 December 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2016 |publisher=[[DNA web Team]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aamir and makers also promoted the film in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainmenttags/anushka-sharma/aamir-anushka-return-dubai-pk-promotions |title=Aamir, Anushka return from Dubai PK promotions |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2016 |publisher=[[Pinkvilla]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repentance''' is the activity of [[Examination of conscience|reviewing one's actions]] and feeling [[contrition]] or regret for past wrongs, which is accompanied by commitment to change for the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geEADgAAQBAJ |title=Justice for All: How the Jewish Bible Revolutionized Ethics |author=Jeremiah Unterman |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2017 |page=109 |isbn=0827612702 |quote=The modern definition of "to repent," according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', is "To review one's actions and feel contrition or regret for something one has done or omitted to do; (esp. in religious contexts) to acknowledge the sinfulness of one's past action or conduct by showing sincere remorse and undertaking to reform in the future."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is generally seen as involving a commitment to personal change and the resolve to live a more responsible and humane life.  In other words, being sorry for one's misdeeds. But it can also involve sorrow over a specific sin or series of sins that an individual feels he or she has committed. The practice of repentance plays an important role in the [[Soteriology|soteriological doctrines]] of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, in which it is often considered necessary for the attainment of [[salvation]]. Analogous practices have been found in other world religions as well. In religious contexts, it often involves an act of [[Confession (religion)|confession]] to God or to a spiritual elder (such as a monk or priest). This typically includes an admission of [[culpability|guilt]], a promise or resolve not to repeat the offense; an attempt to make restitution for the wrong, or in some way to reverse the harmful effects of the wrong where possible. As such, it can be seen as having a certain relationship to modern day therapeutic practices though it clearly differs in its particulars.

==Etymology==
In [[Biblical]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the idea of repentance is represented by two verbs: ◊©◊ï◊ë ''shuv'' (to return) and ◊†◊ó◊ù ''nacham'' (to feel sorrow). In the [[New Testament]], the word translated as 'repentance' is the Greek word ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ± (''metanoia''), "after/behind one's [[mind]]", which is a compound word of the preposition 'meta' (after, with), and the verb 'noeo' (to perceive, to think, the result of perceiving or observing). In this compound word, the preposition combines the two meanings of time and change, which may be denoted by 'after' and 'different'; so that the whole compound means: 'to think differently after'. ''Metanoia'' is therefore primarily an after-thought, different from the former thought; a change of mind and change of conduct, "change of mind and heart", or, "change of consciousness". metanoia: change of mind, repentance
Original Word: ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ±, Œ±œÇ, ·º°
Part of Speech: Noun, Feminine
Transliteration: metanoia
Phonetic Spelling: (met-an'-oy-ah)
Short Definition: repentance, a change of mind
Definition: repentance, a change of mind, change in the inner man.

==Abrahamic religion==
The doctrine of repentance as taught in the [[Bible]] is a call to persons to make a radical turn from one way of life to another. The repentance (''metanoia'') called for throughout the Bible is a summons to a personal, absolute and ultimate unconditional surrender to God as Sovereign. Though it includes sorrow and regret, it is more than that. It is a call to ''conversion'' from self-love, self-trust, and self-assertion to obedient trust and self-commitment to God.&lt;ref name=Stagg&gt;Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology.'' Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}, pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt; It is a change of mind that involves a conscious turning away from wrong actions, attitudes and thoughts that conflict with a Godly lifestyle and biblical commands, and an intentional turning toward doing that which the Bible says pleases God. In repenting, one makes a complete change of direction (180¬∞ turn) toward God. The words "repent," "repentance," and "repented" are mentioned over 100 times in the Bible.&lt;ref name=Stagg/&gt;

Repentance typically requires an admission of [[culpability|guilt]] for committing a wrong or for omitting to do the right thing; a promise or resolve not to repeat the offense; an attempt to make restitution for the wrong, or in some way to reverse the harmful effects of the wrong or the omission where possible.

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Repentance in Judaism}}
{{Bibleref2|Ezekiel|14:6}} says, "Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations."

[[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic Jewish literature]] contains extensive discussions on the subject of repentance. Many rabbinic sources state that repentance is of paramount importance to the existence of this world, so that it was one of the seven provisions which God made before the Creation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] Bavli, tractates Pesahim 54a; Nedarim 39b; [[Midrash]] Genesis Rabbah 1&lt;/ref&gt; "The Holy One, blessed be His name, said to Elijah, 'Behold, the precious gift which I have bestowed on my world: though a man sins again and again, but returns in penitence, I will receive him.'&amp;nbsp;"&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 28b&lt;/ref&gt; "Great is repentance: it brings healing into the world"; "it reaches to the throne of the Lord";{{Bibleref2c|Hosea|14:2,5}} "it brings redemption";{{Bibleref2c|Isaiah|59:20}} "it prolongs man's life";{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|18:21}} Talmud Yoma 86a).
"Repentance and works of charity are man's intercessors before God's throne".&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Shabbath 32a&lt;/ref&gt; Sincere repentance is equivalent to the rebuilding of the Temple, the restoration of the altar, and the offering of all the sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;(Pesiqta, ed. Buber, 25:158; [[Midrash]] Leviticus Rabbah 7; [[Talmud]] Sanhedrin 43b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sincere repentance is manifested when the same temptation to sin, under the same conditions, is ever after resolutely resisted.&lt;ref&gt;([[Talmud]] Yoma 86b; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Teshuva'' 2:1-2)&lt;/ref&gt; "He that confesses his sin and still clings to it is likened to a man that holds in his hand a defiling object; though he batheth in all the waters of the world he is not cleansed; but the moment he casteth the defiling object from him a single bath will cleanse him, as it is said: 'Whosoever confesses and forsakes them [his sins] shall have mercy'&amp;nbsp;".{{Bibleref2c|Prov.|28:13}}&lt;ref&gt;([[Talmud]] Taanith 16a; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Teshuva'' 2:3)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jewish doctrine, repentance is the prerequisite of [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;([[Mishna]] Yoma Chapter 8, 8)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yom Kippur]], the day of atonement, derives its significance only from the fact that it is the culmination of the ten penitential days with which the Jewish religious year begins; and therefore it is of no avail without repentance&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Sifra, Emor, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Though man ought to be penitent every day,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishna]] Avoth Chap 2, 10; [[Talmud]] Shabbath 153a&lt;/ref&gt; the first ten days of every year are the acceptable time announced by the prophet Isaiah: "Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near".{{Bibleref2c|Isaiah|55:6}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] Rosh Hashan 18a; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Teshuva'' 2:6&lt;/ref&gt;

Repentance and the Day of Atonement only absolve one from sins committed against God; from sins against another person they absolve only when restitution has been made and the pardon of the offended party has been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] Yoma 87a; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Teshuva''2:9&lt;/ref&gt;

No one need despair on account of his or her sins, for every penitent sinner is graciously received by God.{{Bibleref2c|Jeremiah|31:9}} Jewish doctrine holds that it is never too late, even on the day of death, to return to God with sincere repentance for "as the sea is always open for every one who wishes to cleanse himself, so are the gates of repentance always open to the sinner".&lt;ref&gt;(Pesiqta., ed. Buber, xxv. 157; Midrash Deuteronomy Rabbah ii.; Midrash Psalms lxiii.)&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish doctrine states that the hand of God is continually stretched out to receive a sinner.&lt;ref&gt;(Talmud Pesachim 119a; Deuteronomy Rabbah ii)&lt;/ref&gt; One view in the Talmud holds that a repentant sinner attains a more exalted spiritual eminence than one who has never sinned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] Berakhoth 34b.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sin to taunt a repentant sinner by recalling their former sinful ways.&lt;ref&gt;([[Talmud]] Bava Metsia 58b; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Teshuva'' 8:8)&lt;/ref&gt;

Repentance occupies a prominent position in all the ethical writings of the Middle Ages. [[Bahya ibn Paquda]] devotes a special section to it in his 'Hovot ha-Levavot", "Gate of Repentance." [[Maimonides]] devotes the last section of "Sefer ha-Madda'" in his [[Mishneh Torah]] to the subject. One of the most significant medieval works on Repentance is "Shaarei Teshuva," the "Gates of Repentance" by [[Yonah Gerondi|Rabbeinu Yona of Gerona]].

In the Hebrew Bible, repentance generally leads to salvation. In some cases, individuals or nations repent of their [[sin]]s and are spared God's judgment. Sometimes the punishment avoided is destruction in this life, and sometimes it is [[damnation]].&lt;ref&gt;In the Hebrew Bible, the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|4:7}}; {{Bibleref2|Leviticus|4, 5}}; {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|4:30}}; {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|30:2}}; {{Bibleref2|1 Kings|8:33, 48}}; {{Bibleref2|Hosea|14:2}}; {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah|3:12,31:18,36:3}}; {{Bibleref2|Ezekiel|18:30-32}}; {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|54:22,55:6-10}}; {{Bibleref2|Joel|2:12}}; {{Bibleref2|Jonah|2:10}}).&lt;/ref&gt; In the Book of Jonah, the prophet initially chose to disobey God's command, and then he repented and became obedient. However, Jonah returned to disobedience when he hoped for the destruction of the city of [[Nineveh]]. The Hebrew term ''teshuvah'' (lit. "return") is used to refer to "repentance". This implies that transgression and [[sin]] are the natural and inevitable consequence of man's straying from God and [[613 mitzvot|His laws]],&lt;ref&gt;(comp. Deut. 11:26-28; Isa. 1:4; Jer. 2:13, 16:11; Ezek. 18:30)&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is man's destiny and duty to be with God. The Bible states that God's loving-kindness is extended to the returning sinner.

The [[Torah]] (five books of Moses) distinguishes between offenses against God and offenses against man. In the first case, the manifestation of repentance consists in: (1) [[Confession in Judaism|Confession]] of one's sin before God,{{Bibleref2c|Lev.|5:5}} {{Bibleref2c|Num.|5:7}} the essential part being a solemn promise and firm resolve not to commit the same sin again. (2) Making certain prescribed offerings.{{Bibleref2c|Lev.|5:1-20}} Offenses against man require, in addition to confession and sacrifice, restitution in full of whatever has been wrongfully obtained or withheld from one's fellow man, with one-fifth of its value added thereto.{{Bibleref2c|Lev.|5:20-26}} If the wronged man has died, restitution must be made to his heir; if he has no heir, it must be given to the priest who officiates at the sacrifice made for the remission of the sin.{{Bibleref2c|Num.|5:7-9}}

There are other manifestations of repentance mentioned in the Bible. These include pouring out water,&lt;ref&gt;(I Sam. 7:6; according to the Targum&lt;/ref&gt; which symbolizes the pouring out of one's heart before God;&lt;ref&gt;comp. Jerusalem Talmud Ta'anit 68d;Midrash Tehilim cxix.; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 2:19);&lt;/ref&gt; prayer&lt;ref&gt;(II Sam. 12:16);&lt;/ref&gt; self-affliction, as fasting; wearing [[sackcloth]]; sitting and sleeping on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;(I Kings 21:27; Joel 2:13; Jonah 3:5).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Prophets disparaged all such outer manifestations of repentance, insisting rather on a complete change of the sinner's mental and spiritual attitude.{{Bibleref2c|Hosea|14:1-2}} "Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger and plenteous in mercy, and repenteth him of the evil".{{Bibleref2c|Joel|2:13}} In {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|55:7}}, the Bible states that repentance brings pardon and forgiveness of sin. Apart from repentance, no other activities, such as sacrifices or religious ceremonies can secure pardon and forgiveness of sin.

=== Christianity ===
{{Main|Repentance (Christianity)}}
In the [[New Testament]], one of many examples of repentance in the New Testament can be found in the [[parable]] of the [[prodigal son]] found in {{Bibleref2|Luke|15:11ff}}. Other instances of repentance included water baptism, restitution, and the burning of occultic possessions.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Bibleref2|Matt.|11:20-21}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|1:4}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|19:8}}; {{Bibleref2|Acts|19:19}}. Such deeds are called "fruits fit for repentance".{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|3:8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repentance appears prominently in the [[Scriptures]]. See the description of repentance in the [[Hebrew Bible]] above for repentance in the [[Old Testament]]. In the [[New Testament]], the first command that Jesus gave was to repent.{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|4:17}} He thus repeated the message of [[John the Baptist]].{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|3:2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicexchange.com/gospel-imperative-repent/|title=Gospel imperative: Repent!|date=26 January 2008|website=Catholicxexchange.com|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus sent out disciples who "proclaimed that people should repent".{{Bibleref2c|Mark|6:12}} In his [[Pentecost]] sermon, [[Peter the Apostle]] called on people to repent,{{Bibleref2c|Acts|2:38}} an appeal he repeated in his sermon at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple: "Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|3:19}} [[Paul the Apostle]] likewise testified "both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God"{{Bibleref2c|Acts|20:21}} and said that "The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|17:30}}

The [[Greek language|Greek]] word used for repentance in the New Testament is ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ± [[Metanoia (theology)|(''metanoia'')]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=meta/noia|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ±|website=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblesuite.com/greek/3341.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 3341.

In English, the prefix ''meta'' can indicate "beyond, about", as "meta-economics" or "meta-philosophy" (see [[meta]]), inspired by the non-Greek use of the word "metaphysics", which in Greek was just the title of a work of [[Aristotle]], the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', so named simply because in the customary ordering of the works of Aristotle it was the book following the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''; the Greek word thus meant nothing more than "[the book that comes] after [the book entitled] ''Physics''". In Greek, composite words that have ŒºŒµœÑŒ±- (''meta-'') as the initial element are most frequently used "of ''change'' of place, condition, plan, etc.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=meta/|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨|website=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the English word "[[metamorphosis]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/metamorphosis|title=Metamorphosis definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=Collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in a non-religious context, the Greek word ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ± (''metanoia''), in particular, meant "change of mind or heart, repentance" or, in rhetoric, "afterthought, correction".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==== Protestantism ====
=====Lutheran=====
[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|235px|Martin Luther's 1534 bible]]
The [[Augsburg Confession]], (known in Latin as Confessio Augustana), is the primary confession of faith used in the Lutheran Church. It is one of the most important documents of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. It divides repentance into two parts:

*"One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the [[Law and Gospel#Book of Concord|knowledge of sin]];"
*"The other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of [[Absolution#Lutheran Church|absolution]], and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article12|title=Augsburg Confession - Book of Concord|website=Bookofconcord.org|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Calvinism=====
In the Calvinist tradition within Protestantism, there is a threefold idea involved in true repentance. The Protestant reformer [[John Calvin]] wrote that repentance "may be justly defined to be a true conversion of our life to God, proceeding from a serious [[fear of God (religion)|fear of God]], and consisting in the mortification of the flesh and of the old man, and in the vivification of the Spirit.‚Äù He further said that "it will be useful to amplify and explain the definition we have given; in which there are three points to be particularly considered".[[File:Calvin 1562.jpg|thumb|200px|John Calvin at 53 in an engraving by [[Ren√© Boyvin]].]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the first place, when we call repentance 'a conversion of the life to God', we require a transformation, not only in the external actions, but in the soul itself; which, after having put off the old nature, should produce the fruits of actions corresponding to its renovation.... &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the second place, we represented repentance as proceeding from a serious fear of God. For before the mind of a sinner can be inclined to repentance, it must be excited by the knowledge of the Divine judgment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It remains for us, in the third place, to explain our position, that repentance consists of two parts‚Äîthe mortification of the flesh and the vivification of the spirit.... Both these branches of repentance effects our participation of Christ. For if we truly partake of his death, our old man is crucified by its power, and the body of sin expires, so that the corruption of our former nature loses all its vigor.... If we are partakers of his resurrection, we are raised by it to a newness of life, which corresponds with the [[righteousness]] of God." [Quotes from ''A Compend of the Institutes of the Christian Religion'' by John Calvin edited by Hugh T. Kerr, The Westminster Press-Philadelphia 1939.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Repentance in Islam}}
The word ''tawbah'' (repentance) in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] literally means 'to return', and is mentioned in the [[Quran]]. In an Islamic context, it refers to the act of leaving what Allah has prohibited and returning to what he has commanded. The act of repentance can redeem the sins and give the opportunity to go to heaven:

:O you who have believed, repent to Allah with sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow [on] the Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed with him. Their light will proceed before them and on their right; they will say, "Our Lord, perfect for us our light and forgive us. Indeed, You are over all things." [''At-Tahriim'' 66:8]

Although repentance is considered as one act that can be used for cleansing the sins, the Quran notes that all of the sins are forgiven with or without repentance except the state of [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]], i.e. the act of worshiping another deity besides Allah. The believing person must repent for shirk sin and seek the forgiveness of Allah. Two verses are giving comments regarding Shirk, ''An-Nisaa'' 4:48 and 4:116.

:Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin. [''An-Nisaa'' 4:48]

Islam does not accept the concept of [[original sin]]; instead, it teaches that a person is born in a state of innocence and pure belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|28|46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person remains in that state of sinlessness until reaching the age of puberty, after which he is accountable for his sins.

== Buddhism ==

The Buddha considered shame over doing wrong ([[Pali]]: ''hiri'') and fear of the consequences of wrongdoing (Pali:''otappa'') as essential safeguards against falling into evil ways and further as extremely useful in the [[Eightfold Path|path of purification]]. Also recommended was the regular practice of self-assessment or wise reflection (Pali: ''yoniso manasikara'') on one's own actions in relation to others and the bigger picture.

In Mahayana Buddhism, one of the most common repentance verses used for reflection is Samantabhadra's Repentance Verse taken from Chapter 40 of the Flower Adornment Sutra:
&lt;poem&gt;
 For all the evil deeds I have done in the past 
 Created by my body, mouth, and mind, 
 From beginningless greed, anger, and delusion, 
 I now know shame and repent of them all.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cttbusa.org/avatamsaka/avatamsaka40_1.asp|title=City of 10,000 Buddhas - Sutra Texts - The Avatamsaka Sutra 40|website=Cttbusa.org|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Hawaiian tradition ==
{{Main|Hawaiian religion}}
[[Ho'oponopono|''Ho{{okina}}oponopono'']] (ho-o-pono-pono) is an ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness, combined with (repentance) prayers. Similar forgiveness practices were performed on islands throughout the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], including Samoa, Tahiti and New Zealand. Traditionally ''ho{{okina}}oponopono'' is practiced by healing priests or ''[[kahuna]] lapa{{okina}}au'' among family members of a person who is physically ill. Modern versions are performed within the family by a family elder, or by the individual alone.

'''Saint Mary's Academy and College''' is a [[parochial school|religious school]] of the [[SSPX|Society of St. Pius X]] located in [[St. Marys, Kansas|St. Marys]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kansas]], 25 miles (40&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Topeka]].

== The original St. Mary's College ==
The original college at this location, '''St. Mary's College''', was founded in 1848 as an [[Native Americans of the United States|Indian]] mission. The school is the site of the first [[cathedral]] west of the [[Missouri River]] and east of the Rockies, the 1851 "log cathedral" of Bishop [[John Baptist Mi√®ge]], S.J., Apostolic Vicar of Pope Pius IX known familiarly as "The Bishop East of the Rockies".&lt;ref name=mission&gt;Timeline of the Mission and Bishop Miege {http://www.smac.edu/?TimeLine1848to1869}&lt;/ref&gt;

(School literature refers to Bishop Miege's cathedral as the first cathedral (in the United States) west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]].  However, (in Mexico,) [[Alta California|Upper California]] was part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sonora|Diocese of Sonora]], which was established in 1779 by [[Pius VI]] and, after 1840 it was under the bishop of Alta and Baja (Upper and Lower) California until the establishment of the [[Diocese of Monterey]] in 1850. Further, this is because the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis|Diocese of St Louis, Missouri]], was established in 1826 and the cornerstone of the current Basilica laid in 1831 on the western bank of the Mississippi River, or essentially ON the river.)

The 465 acre (1.9&amp;nbsp;km¬≤) college had been operated by the [[Jesuit]] order as a seminary since 1931, when the entire theology faculty of [[Saint Louis University]] left that school and transferred to St. Mary's.&lt;ref name="Dosen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dosen|first=Anthony J.|title=Catholic Higher Education in the 1960s: Issues of Identity, Issues of Governance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiuBAvLRZXQC&amp;pg=PA72|year=2009|publisher=IAP|isbn=9781931576314|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; It closed in 1968 as the Jesuit order reoriented itself to other commitments.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

== Saint Mary's Academy and College ==
In 1978, the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] acquired the property along with 12 major buildings. The school is now incorporated in Kansas as ''The Society of Saint Pius X, Saint Mary's, Inc.'' It has no direct ties with the previous St. Marys College.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

As of 2014, the Academy had enrollment of over 800 students K-12 and the two-year college had an enrollment above 90 in a liberal arts curriculum.  St. Mary's does not have a seminary program. St Mary's offers boarding for students in the 8th grade and higher.&lt;ref name=Academy/&gt;

In 2002, the governor of Kansas formally recognized Saint Mary's Academy and College for the excellence of its educational curriculum.  While neither the Academy nor the College are accredited by any accreditation agencies, they do operate with approval from the Kansas Board of Regents.

The school operates its own radio station, KSMK-LP 98.3 FM since 2002.

The Academy teams play in the Kansas Christian League in football and soccer and against some non-league teams.&lt;ref&gt;2010-2011 Ks Christian League Standings {http://www.maxpreps.com/league/xavfhAlAO0iNm_psr0mRSg/standings-kansas-christian-aa-(8-man).htm}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;St Marys Academy 2010-2011 football schedule {http://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/M2EEckEC20OpuHGz87auEA/st-marys-academy-crusaders/football-fall-10/schedule.htm}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Mary's Academy and College is also a [[traditional Catholic]] parish of approximately 4,300 persons (2014).&lt;ref name=parish/&gt;

== Controversy ==
In February 2008, St. Mary's Academy made news when a female referee was told that she could not officiate at the high school basketball game. The other referee allegedly claimed that someone told him it was because "as a woman," she "could not be put in a position of authority over boys because of the academy's beliefs". The Academy denied this "belief".  St. Mary's Academy is on the [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] list of approved schools and can play games against member schools, but is not a KSHSAA member.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sports Illustrated]] February 13, 2008 [http://xesearch-ext.xe.com/CNN.php?/si/2008/highschool/02/13/female.official.ap/index.html Kansas HS refuses female official]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Mary's official reply to the incident was in a press release:&lt;ref name=PressRelease/&gt;

: This alleged reason was neither stated nor is it held by any official of St. Mary's Academy, as evidenced by the fact that the faculty and staff of St. Mary's includes many honorable ladies of talent and erudition....
: St. Mary's Academy follows the directives of the Catholic Church regarding co-education. The Church has always promoted the ideal of forming and educating boys and girls separately during the adolescent years, especially in physical education (Cf. Divini Illius Magistri - Encyclical on the Christian Education of Youth, by Pope Pius XI, 1929 and The Instruction of the Sacred Congregation of Religious on Co-Education, A.A.S., 25 (1958) pp. 99-103). This formation of adolescent boys is best accomplished by male role models, as the formation of girls is best accomplished by women. Hence in boys' athletic competitions, it is important that the various role models (coaches and referees) be men.

The school has been reinstated on the KSHSAA's approved school list.&lt;ref&gt;Kansas State High School Athletic Association Membership Directory&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the school forfeited a football game against [[White City, Kansas|White City]] High School because the opponent had a girl on the team.&lt;ref&gt;http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=1228D4632B15A5D8&amp;p_docnum=3&amp;p_theme=gatehouse&amp;s_site=NKSB&amp;p_product=NKSB&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seneca's Consolations''' refers to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]‚Äôs three Consolatory works, ''De Consolatione ad Marciam'', ''De Consolatione ad Polybium'', ''De Consolatione ad Helviam'', written around 40‚Äì45 AD.

==Context of the Consolations==
[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]‚Äôs three Consolatory works, ''De Consolatione ad Marciam'', ''De Consolatione ad Polybium'', and ''De Consolatione ad Helviam Matrem'', were all constructed in the [[Consolatio Literary Genre|''Consolatio'' Literary Tradition'']], dating back to the fifth century BC. The Consolations are part of Seneca‚Äôs  Treatises, commonly  called [[Dialogue]]s, or Dialogi.&lt;ref name="costa"&gt;Costa, C.D.N. ''Seneca: Four Dialogues''. Aris and Phillips Ltd. England 1994&lt;/ref&gt; These works clearly contain essential principles of Seneca‚Äôs [[Stoicism|Stoic]] teachings.  Although they are personal addresses of Seneca, these works are written more like essays than personal letter of consolation. Furthermore, although each essay is particular in its address of consolation, the tone of these works is notably detached. Seneca seems more preoccupied with presenting facts of the universe and the human condition instead of offering solace. This detachment may be a result of Seneca‚Äôs attempt to gain favor and contrive a return from exile through these Consolatio works, instead of merely offering a friendly hand of comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Scourfield, J. H. D. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ouB8mQmvB8gC&amp;dq=CONSOLING+Heliodorus&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Consoling Heliodorus: a commentary on Jerome, Letter 60''. PAGES 15-22.] Oxford UP, 1993. 19 July 2009. pp. 15‚Äì22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baltussen, Han. ''"PERSONAL GRIEF AND PUBLIC MOURNING IN PLUTARCH'S CONSOLATION TO HIS WIFE."'' INTRODUCTION: BEGINNINGS OF CONSOLATION. ''American Journal of Philology'' '''130''' (2009): 67. July‚ÄìAug. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==De Consolatione ad Helviam Matrem==
In ''De Consolatione ad Helviam Matrem'', Seneca writes his mother to console her on his recent exile to Corsica. In this work, Seneca employs many of the rhetorical devices common to the ''Consolatio Tradition'', while also incorporating his Stoic Philosophy.  Seneca is the consoler and the one inflicting suffering in this work, and notes this paradox in the text.

Seneca was charged with adultery with [[Julia Livilla]], sister of Emperor [[Caligula]] in 41 AD. He was shortly after exiled to [[Corsica]]. Scholars have concluded that the ''De Consolatione ad Helviam'' is dated roughly 42/43 AD. In the text, Seneca tells his mother he does not feel grief, therefore she should not mourn his absence. He refers to his exile merely as a ‚Äòchange of place‚Äô and reassures her his exile did not bring him feelings of disgrace. Seneca comments on his mother‚Äôs strong character as a virtue that will allow her to bear his absence.&lt;ref name=costa/&gt;

Seneca‚Äôs seemingly positive outlook on his own exile follows his Stoic philosophy teachings that one should not be upset by uncontrollable events. This quote from ''De Consolatione ad Helviam'', shows Seneca‚Äôs presentation of his life as tolerable, and even spiritually enjoyable.
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am joyous and cheerful, as if under the best of circumstances. And indeed, now they are the best, since my spirit, devoid of all other preoccupations, has room for its own activities, and either delights in easier studies or rises up eager for the truth, to the consideration of its own nature as well as that of the universe‚Ä¶&lt;ref name="rudich"&gt;Rudich, Vasily. ''Dissidence and literature under Nero''. Routledge, 1997. pp. 27‚Äì35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==De Consolatione ad Polybium==
Seneca wrote ''De Consolatione ad Polybium'' approximately 43/44 AD, during his years in exile.  Scholars often refer to this work as the definitive representation of the part of Seneca‚Äôs life he spent in exile. This Consolatio addresses [[Polybius (freedman)|Polybius]], Emperor [[Claudius]]‚Äô Literary Secretary, to consol him on the death of his brother. The essay contains Seneca‚Äôs Stoic philosophy, with particular attention to the inescapable reality of death. Although the essay is about a very personal matter, the essay itself doesn‚Äôt seem particularly empathetic to Polybius‚Äô unique case, but rather a broader essay on grief and  bereavement. In fact, the reader doesn‚Äôt ever find out the name of Polybius‚Äô deceased brother. One scholar claims that the ''De Consolatione ad Polybium'' is an attempt by Seneca to contrive his return from exile. (Rudich) This letter to Polybius clearly tries to gain his favor, and as well as flatter the Emperor Claudius, ironically seeking to draw empathy for himself in the process:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As many tears as are left to me by my own fortune I do not refuse to shed lamenting yours. For I will manage to find in my eyes, exhausted as they are by my private crying, some that still may pour out, if this will do you any good.&lt;ref name="rudich"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the text of ''De Consolatione ad Polybium'', Seneca encourages Polybius to distract himself from grief with his busy work schedule. The tonal switch from consoling Polybius to flattery of Emperor Claudius occurs in chapter 12. (Ball) Seneca credits the emperor as the source of his ‚Äòhigh station‚Äô and as the giver of his, ‚Äòpleasure of being able to perform duties.‚Äô (Ball) Seneca then delves into a series of prayers of devotion and flattery, which invoke long life for the emperor. This switch is sudden, abrupt, and incongruent with Seneca‚Äôs Stoic philosophy. (Rudrich) It appears almost desperate in its presentation. In fact, the tone is so recognizably changed, some scholars claim other authorship besides Seneca. (Ball) However, it is most widely accepted that the tonal switch in ''De Consolatione ad Polybium'' was nothing more than Seneca‚Äôs desperate attempt to escape exile and return from Corsica. (Rudich)

==De Consolatione ad Marciam==

''De Consolatione ad Marciam'' ("On Consolation to Marcia") is a work by Seneca written around 40 AD. Like Seneca‚Äôs other Consolatory works, this Consolation is constructed in the ''Consolatio'' tradition, and takes the form of an essay versus a personal letter. Seneca was most likely motivated to write this letter of consolation to Marcia in order to gain her favor; Marcia was the daughter of a prominent historian, [[Aulus Cremutius Cordus]], and her family‚Äôs enormous wealth and influence most likely inspired Seneca to write this letter of consolation. Through the essay he sticks to philosophical abstractions concerning Stoic precepts of life and death. For a letter offering solace, he notably lacks empathy toward Marcia's individual grief and loss.&lt;ref name=rudich/&gt;

Marcia actively mourned the death of her son Metilius for over three years. In ''De Consolatione ad Marciam'', Seneca attempts to convince her that the fate of her son, while tragic, should not have been a surprise. She knew many other mothers who had lost their sons; why should she expect her own son to survive her? The acknowledgement, even expectation, of the worst of all possible outcomes is a tenet of Seneca's [[stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy. While Seneca sympathised with Marcia, he reminded her that "we are born into a world of things which are all destined to die," and that if she could accept that no one is guaranteed a just life (that is, one in which sons always outlive their mothers), she could finally end her mourning and live the rest of her life in peace.

&lt;blockquote&gt;the inhabited world... in huge conflagration it will burn and scorch and burn all mortal things... stars will clash with stars and all the fiery matter of the world... will blaze up in a common conflagration. Then the souls of the Blessed, who have partaken of immortality, when it will seem best for god to create the universe anew‚Ä¶ will be changed again into our former elements. Happy, Marcia, is your son who knows these mysteries! (Seneca, ''Ad Marciam de Consolatione'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seneca contrasted two models of maternal grieving: that of [[Octavia Minor]], sister of [[Augustus]], who, on losing her only son [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]] in his twenties, "set no bounds to her tears and moans"; with that of [[Livia]], wife of Augustus, who on losing her son [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] "as soon as she had placed him in the tomb, along with her son she laid away her sorrow, and grieved no more than was respectful to Caesar or fair Tiberius, seeing that they were alive."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.edu/home/araia/senecaconsolatio.html ''De Consolatione ad Marciam'', commentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105142941/http://www.cnr.edu/home/araia/senecaconsolatio.html |date=2008-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consolatory letters==
Several of Seneca's ''[[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|Moral Epistles]]'' are also consolations. Two of the consolations are addressed to [[Lucilius Junior|Lucilius]]: ''Epistle'' 63&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', {{ws|[[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 63|lxiii]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; consoles him on the death of his friend Flaccus; ''Epistle'' 93&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', {{ws|[[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 93|xciii]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; consoles him on the death of the philosopher Metronax. ''Epistle'' 99&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', {{ws|[[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 99|xcix]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists largely of a copy of a letter Seneca wrote to his friend Marullus,&lt;ref&gt;Possibly [[Junius Marullus]], consul ''designatus'' in 62 AD, cf. [[Tacitus]], ''Ann.'' xiv. 48&lt;/ref&gt; following the death of his "little son."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2250">'''Shahrivash''' ({{lang-fa|ÿ¥Ÿáÿ±€åŸàŸéÿ¥}}), also known as '''Shahrnush''' ({{lang-fa|ÿ¥Ÿáÿ±ŸÜŸàÿ¥}}), was the ruler of the [[Paduspanids|Paduspanid dynasty]] from 1117 to 1168. He was the son and successor of [[Hazarasp I]].

== Biography ==
In 1140, the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] Sultan [[Ahmad Sanjar]] sent an army under Abbas, the [[amir]] of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], to invade [[Mazandaran]] and conquer the domains of his vassal the [[Bavandid]] ruler [[Ali I (Bavandid ruler)|Ali I]]. Abbas captured [[Amol]], and several minor rulers of Mazandaran submitted to him, but Ali I urged Shahrivash not to submit to the latter. After some time, Ali made peace with Abbas. In 1142, Ali was succeeded by his son [[Shah Ghazi Rustam IV]], but was shortly challenged by his brother [[Taj al-Muluk Mardavij]], who was supported by Ahmad Sanjar and Shahrivash. However, Shahrivash later changed side and supported Shah Ghazi Rustam IV. Shah Ghazi Rustam IV shortly rewarded Shahrivash by giving him his daughter (or sister), including the two cities [[Natal, Iran|Natal]] and Paydasht. Shahrivash later died in 1168, and was succeeded by his brother [[Kai Ka'us I (Paduspanid ruler)|Kai Ka'us I]].

{{Jainism}}

[[Jainism]] is an ancient [[Indian religion]] belonging to the [[≈õrama·πáa]] tradition. It prescribes ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) towards all living beings to the greatest possible extent. The three main teachings of Jainism are ''ahimsa'', ''[[anekantavada]]'' (non-absolutism), ''[[aparigraha]]'' (non-possessiveness). Followers of Jainism take five main vows: ''ahimsa'', ''[[satya]]'' (not lying), ''[[asteya]]'' (non stealing), ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (chastity), and ''aparigraha''. Monks follow them completely whereas ''[[≈örƒÅvaka (Jainism)|≈õrƒÅvakas]]'' (householders) observe them partially. Self-discipline and [[Jain monasticism|asceticism]] are thus major focuses of Jainism.

By longstanding tradition, ulama are educated in religious institutions ''([[madrasa]]s)''. The [[Quran]], ''[[sunnah]]'' (authentic [[hadith]]), ''[[qiyas]]'' (analogical reasoning, for Sunni Islam) or ''[['aql]]'' ("dialectical reasoning", for [[Shia Islam]]), ''[[ijma]]'' (juridical consensus) are the sources of traditional [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

Over time, the intellectual discourse and teachings of the ulama have significantly contributed to the debates in the Muslim public sphere, and still do so to the present day. Increasingly, the traditional scholars of Islam are becoming prominent actors in contemporary Muslim societies and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Muhammad Qasim Zaman| title=The Ulama in Contemporary Islam: Custodians of Change| publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]| year=2007| isbn=978-0-691-13070-5| page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional way of education==
[[File:Diploma WDL2489.png|thumb|Ijazah (diploma of competency) in Arabic calligraphy, written by 'Ali Ra'if Efendi in 1206 AH (1791 AD)]]

Students did not associate themselves with a specific educational institution, but rather sought to join renowned teachers.&lt;ref name="Berkey 1992"/&gt; By tradition, a scholar who had completed his studies was approved by his teacher. At the teacher's individual discretion, the student was given the permission for teaching and for the issuing of legal opinions ''([[fatwa]])''. The official approval was known as the ''[[Ijazah|ijazat at-tadris wa 'l-ifta]]'' ("license to teach and issue legal opinions").&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi&gt;{{citation| last=Makdisi| first=George| title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West| journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society| volume=109| issue=2| date=April‚ÄìJune 1989| pages=175‚Äì182 [175‚Äì77]| doi=10.2307/604423| jstor=604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through time, this practice established a chain of teachers and pupils who became teachers in their own time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Graham| first1=William| title=Traditionalism in Islam: An essay in interpretation.| journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History| date=1993| volume=23| issue=3| pages=495‚Äì522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places of learning==
[[File:Haseki-Huerrem-Sultan-waqf_Jerusalem.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Endowment charter ''(vakƒ±f-nƒÅme)'' of the [[H√ºrrem Sultan]] mosque, madrasa and soup kitchen in Jerusalem]]

The traditional place of higher education was the [[madrasa]]. The institution likely came up in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] during the 10th century AD, and spread to other parts of the Islamic world from the late 11th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Zaman_NCHoI_600_603"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Zaman| first1=Muhammad Qasim| editor1-last=Cook| editor1-first=Michael |title=Transmitters of authority and ideas across cultural boundaries, eleventh to eighteenth century. In: The new Cambridge history of Islam| date=2010| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK| isbn=978-0-521-51536-8| pages=600‚Äì603| edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous early madrasas are the Sunni [[Nezamiyeh|Ni·∫ìƒÅmiyya]], founded by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] vizir [[Nizam al-Mulk]] (1018‚Äì1092) in [[Greater Iran|Iran and Iraq]] in the 11th century. The [[Mustansiriya Madrasah|Mustansiriya]], established by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliph]] [[Al-Mustansir (Baghdad)|Al-Mustansir]] in [[Baghdad]] in 1234 AD, was the first to be founded by a caliph, and also the first known to host teachers of all four major [[madhhab]] known at that time. From the time of the [[Persian peoples|Persian]] [[Ilkhanate]] (1260‚Äì1335 AD) and the [[Timurid dynasty]] (1370‚Äì1507 AD) onwards, madrasas often became part of an architectural complex which also included a mosque, a Sufi [[tariqa|·π≠arƒ´qa]], and other buildings of socio-cultural function, like [[Turkish bath|baths]] or a [[Bimaristan|hospital]].&lt;ref name="Zaman_NCHoI_600_603"/&gt;

Madrasas were merely (sacred) places of learning. They provided boarding and salaries to a limited number of teachers, and boarding for a number of students out of the revenue from religious endowments ''([[waqf]])'', allocated to a specific institution by the donor. In later times, the deeds of endowment were issued in elaborate [[Islamic calligraphy]], as is the case for Ottoman endowment books ''(vakƒ±f-name)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=J. M. Rogers| title=Religious endowments. In: Empire of the Sultans. Ottoman art from the collection of Nasser D. Khalili| year=1995| location=London| publisher=Azimuth Editions/The Noor Foundation| isbn=978-2-8306-0120-6| pages=82‚Äì91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The donor could also specify the subjects to be taught, the qualification of the teachers, or which madhhab the teaching should follow.&lt;ref name="Zaman_NCHoI_600_603"/&gt; However, the donor was free to specify in detail the curriculum, as was shown by Ahmed and Filipovic (2004) for the Ottoman imperial madrasas founded by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ahmed| first1=Shabab| last2=Filipovich| first2=Nenad| title=The sultan's syllabus: A curriculum for the Ottoman imperial medreses prescribed in a ferman of Qanuni I S√ºleyman, dated 973 (1565)| journal=Studia Islamica| date=2004| volume=98| issue=9| pages=183‚Äì218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Berkey (1992) has described in detail for the education in medieval [[Cairo]], unlike medieval Western universities, in general madrasas had no distinct curriculum, and did not issue diplomas.&lt;ref name="Berkey 1992"&gt;{{cite book| author=Jonathan Berkey| title=The transmission of knowledge in medieval Cairo: A social history of Islamic education| publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton, NJ| year=1992| isbn=978-0-691-63552-1| jstor=j.ctt7zvxj4| pages=44‚Äì94| issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The educational activities of the  madrasas focused on the law, but also included what Zaman (2010) called "Sharia sciences" ''(al- øul≈´m al-naqliyya)'' as well as the rational sciences like philosophy, astronomy, mathematics or medicine. The inclusion of these sciences sometimes reflect the personal interests of their donors, but also indicate that scholars often studied various different sciences.&lt;ref name="Zaman_NCHoI_600_603"/&gt;

==Branches of learning==
===Mysticism===
{{main|Sufism}}
Early on in Islamic history, a line of thought developed around the idea of [[mysticism]], striving for the perfection ''([[Ihsan]])'' of worship. Originating out of Syria and Iraq rather than the Hijaz, the idea of Sufism was related to devotional practices of eastern Christian [[monasticism]], although [[Monasticism#Islam|monastic life in Islam]] is discouraged by the Quran.&lt;ref name="Hourani_HAP_P72_75"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Hourani| first1=Albert| title=A history of the Arab peoples| date=2012| publisher=Faber| location=London| isbn=978-0-571-28801-4| pages=72_75| edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first Islamic century, [[Hasan of Basra|·∏§asan al-Ba·π£rƒ´]] (642‚Äì728 AD) was one of the first Muslim scholars to describe, according to [[Albert Hourani]] (1991) "the sense of the distance and nearness of God&amp;nbsp;... in the language of love". During the 7th century, the ritual of [[Dhikr]] evolved as a "way of freeing the soul from the distractions of the world". Important early scholars who further elaborated on mysticism were [[Harith al-Muhasibi]] (781‚Äì857 AD) and [[Junayd of Baghdad|Junayd al-Baghdadi]] (835‚Äì910 AD).&lt;ref name="Hourani_HAP_P72_75"/&gt;

===Philosophy and ethics===
{{main|Islamic philosophy}}
The [[early Muslim conquests]] brought about Arab Muslim rule over large parts of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic world]]. During the time of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], at latest, the scholars of the emerging Islamic society had become familiar with the classical philosophical and scientific traditions of the world they had conquered. The collection of classical works and their translation into the Arabian language&lt;ref name="Sezgin 1970_P3_4"&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Fuat Sezgin]]| title=Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums Bd. III: Medizin ‚Äì Pharmazie ‚Äì Zoologie ‚Äì Tierheilkunde = History of the Arabic literature Vol. III: Medicine ‚Äì Pharmacology ‚Äì Veterinary Medicine| date=1970| publisher=E. J. Brill| location=Leiden| pages=3‚Äì4}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated a period which is known today as the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. According to Hourani (1991), the works of the classical scholars of antiquity were met with considerable intellectual curiosity by Islamic scholars. Hourani quotes [[al-Kindi]] (c. 801‚Äì873 AD), "the father of Islamic philosophy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abboud|first=Tony|title=Al-Kindi : the father of Arab philosophy|date=2006|publisher=Rosen Pub. Group|isbn=978-1-4042-0511-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We should not be ashamed to acknowledge truth from whatever source it comes to us, even if it is brought to us by former generations and foreign peoples.

The works of [[Aristotle]], in particular his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', had a profound influence on the Islamic scholars of the Golden Age like [[Al-Farabi]] (870‚Äì950 AD), [[Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri]] (d. 992 AD) and [[Avicenna|Ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ]] (ca. 980‚Äì1037 AD). In general, the Islamic philosophers saw no contradiction between philosophy and the religion of Islam. However, according to Hourani, al-Farabi also wrote that philosophy in its pure form was reserved for an intellectual elite, and that ordinary people should rely for guidance on the ''sharia''. The distinction between a scholarly elite and the less educated masses "was to become a commonplace of Islamic thought".&lt;ref name="Hourani_HAP_P78"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Hourani| first1=Albert| title=A history of the Arab peoples| date=2012| publisher=Faber| location=London| isbn=978-0-571-28801-4| page=78| edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; As exemplified by the works of [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|al-Razi]] (854‚Äì925 AD), during later times, philosophy "was carried on as a private activity, largely by medical men, pursued with discretion, and often met with suspicion".&lt;ref name="Hourani_HAP_P78"/&gt;

===Law===
{{main|Sharia}}
According to [[Shia Islam]], the authority to interpret the messages of the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]] lies with the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imamah]], a line of infallible interpreters of the truth. The [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] majority, however, reject this concept and maintain that Gods Will has been completely revealed in the Quran and ''[[sunnah]]'' of the Prophet. The capacity of its interpretation lies with the ulama.&lt;ref name="Hourani_HAP_P158"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Hourani| first1=Albert| title=A history of the Arab peoples| date=2012| publisher=Faber| location=London| isbn=978-0-571-28801-4| page=158| edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the eleventh century, the major schools of law ''([[madhhab]])'' had emerged. Whilst, historically, the schools were at times engaged in mutual conflicts, the differences became less controversial over time, and merely represent regional predominances today. The four most important of them are:&lt;ref name="Hourani_HAP_P158"/&gt;
* [[Shafi'i]] ([[Egypt]], [[Mashriq]], [[Hijaz]], [[Yemen]])
* [[Maliki]] ([[Maghreb]] and [[West Africa]])
* [[Hanafi]] ([[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]], [[the Balkans]], [[Turkey]])
* [[Hanbali]] (most common in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf counties]])

Shia madhhab include the [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari]] and [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] schools. Minor madhhab also mentioned in the [[Amman message]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amman Message|url=http://ammanmessage.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=29&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1| accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the [[Ibadi]] and the [[Zahiri]] schools.

All Sunni ''madhhabs'' recognize four sources of ''[[sharia]]'' (divine law): the Quran, ''[[sunnah]]'' (authentic hadith), ''[[qiyas]]'' (analogical reasoning), and ''[[ijma]]'' (juridical consensus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|ref=harv |first=Farhat J.|last=Ziadeh|title=U·π£≈´l al-fiqh|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L.

The Hanafis hold that strict analogy may at times be supported by a limited use of juristic preference ''([[istihsan]])'', whereas the Maliki school also allows pragmatic considerations in the interest of public welfare ''([[istislah]])'' are also acceptable.&lt;ref name="Hourani_HAP_P158_160"/&gt; Instead of the Sunni concept of analogy ''(qiyƒÅs)'', Shia ulama prefer "dialectical reasoning" ''([['Aql]])'' to deduce law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[John Esposito]]| title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam| location=Oxford, UK | publisher =Oxford University Press| year=2004| page=22 | isbn=978-0-19-512559-7| title-link=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of substantive jurisprudence ''([[fiqh]]'') defines the proper way of life through interpretation of ''sharia'', which Muslims should  follow if they want to live according to God's will. Over time, the ''madhhabs'' established "codes of conduct", examining human actions in the light of the Quran and Hadith. Supplementing the sharia were customs ''([[Urf| øurf]])'' within a given society. Islamic law and regional customs were not opposed to each other: In 15th century Morocco, [[qadi]]s were allowed to use a process called '' ªamal'' in order to  choose from different juridical opinions one which applied best to the local customs, even if they were not supported by the consensus of the majority. More often, the use of sharia led to changes in local customs.&lt;ref name="Hourani_HAP_P158_160"/&gt;

=== Theology ===

[[Kalam| øIlm al-KalƒÅm]], the "science of discourse", also termed "Islamic theology", serves to explain and defend the doctrine of the Quran and Hadith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Tim J.

From the 11th century on, the Mu øtazila was suppressed by the Sunni [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the [[Seljuk Empire]], but it continued playing an important role in the formation of Shia theology. The [[Ash'ari]] school encouraged the use of KalƒÅm as the basis of fiqh, and was followed in this approach by parts of the Shafi'i madhhab. In contrast, the Hanbali and Maliki madhhabs discouraged theological speculation. [[Abu Mansur al-Maturidi]] (853‚Äì944 AD) developed his own form of KalƒÅm, differing from the Ash'ari view in the question of Man's free will and God's omnipotence. Maturidi KalƒÅm was often used in combination with Hanafi fiqh in the northwestern parts of the Islamic world.&lt;ref name="Hourani_HAP_P158_160"/&gt;

A distinct school of theology often called [[Traditionalist theology (Islam)|traditionalist theology]] emerged under the leadership of [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] in the early centuries of Islam among hadith scholars who rejected rationalistic argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lapidus | first = Ira M. | authorlink=Ira M. Lapidus | title = A History of Islamic Societies | publisher = Cambridge University Press (Kindle edition) | year = 2014| page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the Ash'arite synthesis between Mu'tazilite rationalism and [[Hanbalite]] literalism, its original form survived among a minority of mostly Hanbalite scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lapidus | first = Ira M. | authorlink=Ira M.

Islamic theology experienced further developments among [[Schools of Islamic theology#Shia schools of theology|Shia theologians]].

==Cosmopolitan scholarly tradition==
The study of, and commentaries on Quran and hadith, debates about ''ijtihad'' and ''taqlid'' and the issuing of ''fatwa'' as well as the use of Arabic, and later also Persian as common languages of discourse constituted the religious authority of the ulama throughout the entire Islamic world. Zaman (2010)&lt;ref name="Zaman_NCHoI_595_599"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Zaman| first1=Muhammad Qasim| editor1-last=Cook| editor1-first=Michael |title=Transmitters of authority and ideas across cultural boundaries, eleventh to eighteenth century. In: The new Cambridge history of Islam| date=2010| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK| isbn=978-0-521-51536-8| pages=595‚Äì599| edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; has demonstrated that, as personal contacts were key to acquiring knowledge, Islamic scholars sometimes travelled far in search of knowledge ''(·π≠alab al- øilm)''. Due to their common training and language, any scholars travelling from one region of the Islamic world to another could easily integrate themselves into the local Muslim community and hold offices there: The traveller [[Ibn Battuta|Ibn Ba·π≠≈´·π≠ah]] (1304‚Äì1368 or 1369), born in [[Tangiers]], Morocco, to a family of ulema, was appointed qadi by Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] of [[Sultanate of Delhi|Delhi]]. [[Nuruddin ar-Raniri]] (d. 1658), born to a [[Gujarati Muslims|Gujarati Muslim]] family, travelled to, and worked as Shaykh ul-Islam in modern-day [[Indonesia]] under the protection of [[Iskandar Thani]], [[Aceh Sultanate|Sultan of Aceh]].&lt;ref name="Zaman_NCHoI_595_599"/&gt; Both scholars were able to move freely in an "interconnected world of fellow scholars".&lt;ref&gt;Zaman (2010), p. 598&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zaman, their offices and positions as respected scholars were only questioned if they proved themselves unfamiliar with local customs (as happened to Ibn Ba·π≠≈´·π≠ah]), or met resistance from opponents with stronger local roots (ar-Raniri).&lt;ref name="Zaman_NCHoI_595_599"/&gt;

Through their travels and teachings, ulama were able to transmit new knowledge and ideas over considerable distances. However, according to Zaman (2010), scholars were often required to rely on commonly known texts which could support their ''fatwas''. A text which might be widely known within the intellectual circles of one region could be unknown in another. The ability of scholars from one region to support their argument in another might therefore be limited by the familiarity with the respective texts of the community they were working in. Likewise, in an era without book print or mass communication media, a scholar's reputation might remain limited if he was unfamiliar with the local canon of texts. As the ''[[ijazah]]'', the scholar's approval by another master, was key to the scholar's reputation, the latter would be greater in regions where the approving masters were more widely known.&lt;ref name="Zaman_NCHoI_603_606"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Zaman| first1=Muhammad Qasim| editor1-last=Cook| editor1-first=Michael |title=Transmitters of authority and ideas across cultural boundaries, eleventh to eighteenth century.

==Political history of the ulama==
===Early Muslim communities===
The formative period of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] stretches back to the time of the early Muslim communities. In this period, jurists were more concerned with pragmatic issues of authority and teaching than with theory.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss (2002), pp.3,161&lt;/ref&gt; Progress in theory began to develop with the coming of the early Muslim jurist [[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i]] (767‚Äì820), who codified the basic principles of Islamic jurisprudence in his book ''ar-RisƒÅlah''. The book details the four roots of law (Qur'an, [[Sunnah]], ''[[ijma]]'', and ''[[qiyas]]'') while specifying that the primary Islamic texts (the Qur'an and the hadith) must be understood according to objective rules of interpretation derived from scientific study of the Arabic language.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss (2002), p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Feldman (2008), under many Muslim caliphate states and later states ruled by sultans, the ulama were regarded as the guardians of Islamic law and prevented the Caliph from dictating legal results, with the ruler and ulama forming a sort of "separation of powers" in government.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt; Laws were decided based on the ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) of the [[Ummah]] (community), which was most often represented by the legal scholars.&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{Cite news|author=Noah Feldman|title=Why Shariah?|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=March 16, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html?ei=5070&amp;em=&amp;en=5c1b8de536ce606f&amp;ex=1205812800&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2008-10-05|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern Islamic empires===
The Sunni Ottoman, and the [[Shi'a]] Safavid Persian dynasties, rulers of the two opponent early modern Islamic empires, both relied on ulama in order to legitimise their power. In both empires, ulama patronised by the royal courts created "official" religious doctrines which supported the dynastic rule. At the high points of their political power, respectively, the development took different paths: The Ottoman Sultan [[S√ºleyman I]] successfully integrated the imperial ulama into the imperial bureaucracy, and Ottoman secular law into Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Zilfi 2006"/&gt; In contrast, Shah [[Abbas I of Persia]] was unable to gain similar support by the Shi'a ulama, who retained a more independent position. During the late Safavid empire, the Shi'a ulama developed into one of the warrantors of continuity in a period of instability of the central government, thus securing a relative independency which they retained during the reign of subsequent  dynasties.&lt;ref name="Garthwaite_NCHoI_507_508"/&gt;

After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the leaders and subjects of the Ottoman Empire became increasingly aware of its role as a [[great power]] of its time. This new self-awareness was associated with the idea to legitimise the new political role by linking the religious scholarship to the political system: Ottoman historians of the 15th and 16th century like Ibn Zunbul or Eyy√ªb√Æ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Eyy√ªb√Æ (Mehmet Akku≈ü, transl.) |title=Men√¢kib-i Sultan S√ºleyman (Ris√¢le-i P√¢dis√ß√¢h-n√¢me) |publisher=K√ºlt√ºr Bakanlƒ±ƒüƒ± |location=Ankara |year=1991 |isbn=978-975-17-0757-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vEvAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the deeds of the Ottoman sultans in terms of idealised Islamic [[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]] warriors. According to Burak (2015), the [[Ottoman literature]] genres of the "rank order" ({{lang-tr|taba·∏≥at}} and the "biografic lexicon" ({{lang-tr|E≈ü-≈üakaiku'n}}) compiled the biographies of scholars in such ways as to create a concise and coherent tradition of the doctrine and structure of the Ottoman imperial scholarship. During the 16th century, scholars like the Shaykh al-IslƒÅm [[Ibn Kemal|KemƒÅlpa≈üazade]] (d. 1534), [[Ta≈ük√∂pr√ºzade|A·∏•mƒÅd b.

From the conquest of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo]] in 1517 onwards, the Ottoman ulama set up their own interpretation of the Sunni Hanafi doctrine which then served as the official religious doctrine of the empire. The formal acknowledgment by decree of the sultan became a prerequisite to issue fatwas. In the 17th century, the annalist al-Hamawi used the expression "sultanic mufti" ''(al-ifta' al-sultani)'' to delineate the difference between the officially appointed religious leaders and those who had followed the traditional way of education.&lt;ref name=burak21-64/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mu·π£·π≠afa b.

The ulama in the Ottoman Empire had a significant influence over politics because it was believed that secular institutions were all subordinate to Islamic law, the [[Sharia]] ''({{lang-tr|≈ûeriat}})''. The ulama were responsible for interpreting the religious law, therefore they claimed that their power superseded that of the government.&lt;ref name=inalcik-171&gt;Inalcik, Halil. 1973. "Learning, the Medrese, and the Ulemas." In the Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300‚Äì1600. New York: Praeger, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Ottoman hierarchy of ulama, the Shaykh al-IslƒÅm held the highest rank. He exerted his influence by issuing fatwas, his written interpretations of the sharia had authority over the entire Ottoman population. In the 16th century, as the support by the ulama of the sultan and the central government was essential for shaping the still-growing empire, the importance of the office rose, and its power increased. As members of the ''[[Ilmiye]]'', the imperial scholars were part of the Ottoman elite class of the [[Askeri]], and were exempt from any taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Hans Georg Majer|title=Vorstudien zur Geschichte der ƒ∞lmiye im Osmanischen Reich|publisher=Trofenik|PublicationPlace=M√ºnchen|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;1‚Äì28|isbn=978-3-87828-125-2|date=1978|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shi'a state religion of Safavid Persia====
[[Safi-ad-din Ardabili|Shaikh ·π¢ƒÅfƒ´ ad-Dƒ´n Is·∏•ƒÅq Ardabƒ´lƒ´]] (1252‚Äì1334) was the founder of the [[Safaviyya]] [[tariqa]]. Safi ad-Din's great-great grandson [[Ismail I|Ismail]], who from 1501 onwards ruled over the [[Persian Empire]], was the founder of the [[Safavid dynasty]]. [[Shah]] Ismail I proclaimed the [[Twelver]] Shi'a as the new Persian state religion. To [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|propagate the Safavid faith]], he invited ulama from [[Qom]], [[Jabal Amel|Jabal 'ƒÄmil]] in southern [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]] to travel around Iran and promote the Shi'a doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Willem Floor, Edmund Herzig| title=Iran and the World in the Safavid Age| date=2015| publisher=I.B.Tauris| isbn=978-1-78076-990-5| page=20| url=https://books.google.com/?id=HZNpBgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=safavids+imported+lebanon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Roger Savory| title=Iran under the Safavids| date=2007| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK| isbn=978-0-521-04251-2| page=30|url=https://books.google.com/?id=v4Yr4foWFFgC&amp;dq=safavids+imported+syria}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1533, Shah [[Tahmasp I]] commissioned a new edition of the [[Safvat as-safa]], Shaikh ·π¢ƒÅfƒ´'s genealogy.

During the reign of Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] (1571 ‚Äì 1629 AD), the argument of the [[Theocracy|theocratic]] unity of religious and political power was no longer sufficient to legitimise the Shah's authority: Shi'a ulama renounced the monarch's claim to represent the hidden Imam by teaching that descendancy did not necessarily mean representation. Likewise, as the influence of Sufi mysticism weakened, the Shah's role as the head of the Safaviyya lost its significance as a justification for his political role. Abbas I thus sought to associate himself with eminent ulama like [[BahƒÅ æ al-dƒ´n al- øƒÄmilƒ´|Shaykh BahƒÅ æi]] (1574‚Äì1621 AD), whom he made Shaykh al-IslƒÅm in his new capital, Isfahan. Other famous ulama working under Abbas's patronage were [[Mir Damad]] (d. 1631 or 1632 AD), one of the founders of the [[School of Isfahan]], and [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad Ardabili]] (d. 1585). By their teachings, they further developed the Shi'a Islamic teachings and religious practice. However, as religion did no longer suffice to support political power in Persia, Abbas I had to develop independent concepts to legitimise his rule. He did so by creating a new ''"[[ghulam]]"'' army, thus evoking the [[Turco-Mongol tradition]] of [[Timur]] and his reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Quinn| first1=Sholeh A.| editor1-last=Cook| editor1-first=Michael |title=Iran under Safavid rule.

===19th century===
====New Ottoman scholarly elite====
By the beginning of the 19th century, the Ottoman ulama still retained their political influence. When sultan [[Selim III]] tried to reform the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]], the ulama opposed his plans, which they rejected as an [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy from Islam]]. Consequently, his reform failed. However, Selims successor [[Mahmud II]] (r. 1808‚Äì1839) was more successful: He called the new troops, organised according to European models, by the name "Victorious army of Muhammad" ''(As√¢kir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye)''. By doing so, he was able to overcome the accusation of apostasy and secure the ulama's support.&lt;ref name="HME_73_75"&gt;{{cite book| author=William L. Cleveland, Martin Bunton| title=A history of the modern Middle East| publisher=Perseus Books Group| location=New York| year=2016| isbn=978-0-8133-4980-0| pages=73‚Äì75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmuds reforms created a new imperial elite class who spoke Western European languages and were knowledgeable of the Western European societies and their political systems. As the political and economic pressure increased on the Ottoman Empire in the course of the 19th century, this new elite carried on the Sultan's reforms and helped initiating a new era of reform, the [[Tanzimat]]. In parallel, the political influence of the ulama was circumvented and reduced step by step. A ministry for religious endowments was created in order to control the finances of the [[Waqf|vakƒ±f]]. Thus, the ulama lost direct control over their finances, which significantly reduced their capacity to exert political influence.&lt;ref name="HME_73_75"/&gt;

====Orthodox Shi'a ulama in post-Safavid and Qajar Iran====
[[File:Portrait of Allamah Majlisi.jpg|thumb|Iranian Shaykh ul-Islam Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi (1627‚Äì1699)]]

In Iran, a period of political instability began with the collapse of the Safavid reign after shah [[Sultan Husayn]]s death in 1722. In the light of the discontinuity and fragmentation of the central government, two social groups maintained continuity and, consequently, rose in power: Tribal chieftains established, amongst others, the [[Khanates of the Caucasus]], the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] and [[Zand dynasty|Zand dynasties]]. The second group who benefitted from the weakness of the central authority was the Shi'a ulama. According to Garthwaite (2010), "the ulama constituted one institution that not only provided continuity, but gradually asserted its role over and against royal authority." A process of change began which continued throughout the 19th century and into the present.&lt;ref name="Garthwaite_NCHoI_504_525"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Garthwaite| first1=G.R.| editor1-last=Cook| editor1-first=Michael |title=Transition: The end of the old order ‚Äì Iran in the eighteenth century.

Already some of the last Safavids, [[Suleiman I of Persia|Sulayman Shah]] (r. 1666‚Äì1694) and [[Tahmasp II]] (r. 1722‚Äì1732) had sought the ulama's support in an attempt to strengthen their authority. Particularly, they associated themselves with a group of ulama who supported the "official" [[Twelver]] Shi'a doctrine, established by the Iranian Shaykh al-IslƒÅm [[Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi]] (1627‚Äì1699) during the later decades of Safavid rule. The dispute between the Twelver Shi'a and [[Mir Damad]]'s (d. 1631 or 1632) and [[Mulla Sadra|·π¢adr ad-Dƒ´n Mu·∏•ammad Shƒ´rƒÅzƒ´]]'s (c. 1571/2 ‚Äì 1640) [[School of Isfahan]], who promoted Sufi mysticism and [[Islamic philosophy]], continued throughout the 18th century, and shaped the relationship between ulama and government during the reigns of the subsequent dynasties.&lt;ref name="Garthwaite_NCHoI_507_508"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Garthwaite| first1=G.R.| editor1-last=Cook| editor1-first=Michael |title=Transition: The end of the old order ‚Äì Iran in the eighteenth century.

With the accession of [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar]] to the Iranian throne, the [[Qajar dynasty]] consolidated the central power. However, the Qajar Shahs, in particular [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] (r. 1848‚Äì1896), whose reign paralleled that of the Ottoman Sultans of the Tanzimat time, failed at obtaining central control over the ulama. The [[Shia|Shiite]] scholars retained their political influence on the Persian society. They also maintained unrestricted access to the financial resources from the religious endowments. In addition, the Islamic [[Zakat]] tax was paid to individual imams and not to state-sponsored tax collectors. Both their religious influence and their financial means allowed the Shiite ulama to act, at times, against the Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=William L.

===19th/20th century: Ulama and Muslim reform===
====Reformers and concepts====
Starting in the first half of the 19th century, direct contacts began and gradually increased between members of the ulama and modern Western Europe. The Egyptian alim [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] (1801‚Äì1873) was amongst the first members of the ulama who travelled to Europe. As a religious counsellor to a delegation by the Egyptian [[khedive]] [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] he stayed in Paris from 1826 to 1831. His report "The Extraction of Gold or an Overview of Paris" ''(Ta·∏´lƒ´·π£ al-ibrƒ´z fƒ´ tal·∏´ƒ´·π£ BƒÅrƒ´z)'' (1849) included some outlines of future reforms and potential improvements in his native country. Although al-Tahtawi had gone through the traditional education of an alim, his interest focused on modern French concepts of administration and economy. He only referred to Islam in order to emphasize that Muslims can adopt practical knowledge and insights from Europe. As such, at-Tahtawis report reflects the political efforts of Muhammad Ali Pasha, who did not intend to reform al-Azhar university, but aimed at building an independent educational system sponsored by his government.&lt;ref name="Dallal_NCHoI"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ahmad S. Dallal |title=The origins and early development of Islamic reform. In: R. Hefner (Ed.): The New Cambridge History of Islam. Vol. 6: Muslims and modernity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, U.K. |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-84443-7 |pages=107‚Äì147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hayreddin Pasha]] (1822/3‚Äì1890) was an [[Ottoman Tunisia]]n alim and statesman who reformed the administration and jurisdiction of the province. He was able to explain his ideas in French (''R√©formes n√©cessaires aux √âtats musulmans'' ‚Äì Necessary reforms of the Muslim states. Paris, 1868), which he had learned whilst representing his sovereign [[Ahmad I ibn Mustafa|Ahmad Bey]] at the court of [[Napoleon III]] from 1852 to 1855. In contrast to al-Tahtawi, Hayreddin Pasha used the religious concept of the Muslim collective interest ''([[Maslaha|ma·π£la·∏•a]])'' to make his point, thereby applying the idea of [[ijtihad]] to public affairs.&lt;ref name="Dallal_NCHoI" /&gt;

Positions comparable to the Western Islamic ulama were also taken in the Eastern parts of the Islamic world by [[Syed Ahmad Khan]], the pioneering Muslim modernist in South Asia, and [[JamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al-AfghƒÅnƒ´]]. The latter is regarded as the mentor of [[Pan-Islamism]], but also as one of the founders of the [[Islamism|political Islam]] and of the late 19th and 20th century [[Salafi movement]].&lt;ref name="Dallal_NCHoI" /&gt;

The [[Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah|Egyptian Grand Mufti]] [[Muhammad Abduh|Mu·∏•ammad  øAbduh]] (1849‚Äì1905), who was granted the degree of 'Alim by al-Azhar university in 1877, was the first who used the term [[Islah|IslƒÅh]] in order to denote political and religious reforms. Until 1887 he edited together with al-AfghƒÅnƒ´ the newspaper ''al- øUrwa al-WuthqƒÅ'' ("The firm bond"). The gazette widely spread the pan-islamistic concept of Islam representing a religious bond which was believed to be stronger than nationality or language. From 1876 on,  øAbduh edited the newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram|al-AhrƒÅm]]''. Since 1898, he also edited, together with [[Rashid Rida|Rashƒ´d RidƒÅ]] (1865‚Äì1935), the newspaper ''al-ManƒÅr'' ("The Beacon"),{{refn|group=note|not to be confused with the television station [[Al-Manar]]}} in which he further developed his ideas. ''al-ManƒÅr'' appeared in print for almost 40 years and was read throughout the Islamic world.&lt;ref name="Dallal_NCHoI" /&gt;

 øAbduh understood Islah as a concept of "reform of mankind" ''(i·π£lƒÅ·∏• nau ø al-insƒÅn)''.&lt;ref name="merad_144a"&gt;Merad: Article "I·π£lƒÅ·∏•. 1. The Arab World" in ''EI¬≤'' Vol. IV. p. 144a.&lt;/ref&gt; In his works, he emphasized the special importance of a reform of the traditional madrasa system, which was taken to disadvantage by the parallel establishment of the secular, state-sponsored educational system in Egypt. He strove at reconciling the traditional and modern educational systems, thereby justifying from the point of view of Islam the introduction of modern institutions by the national state. He referred to the Islamic concept of the collective interest or [[common good]] of the Muslim community ''(ma·π£la·∏•a)'', to which he accorded overarching importance ''(al-ma·π£la·∏•a shar)'' in the interest of his fellow Muslims. The concept of ''islƒÅh'' gained special relevance for the future, as it strives at understanding and justifying all aspects of modern life from the Islamic doctrine.&lt;ref name="Dallal_NCHoI" /&gt;

After  øAbduhs death in 1905, Rashƒ´d RidƒÅ continued editing ''"al-ManƒÅr"'' on his own. In 1924, he published a collection of writings by some ulama of [[Najd]]: ''Ma«ßm≈´ øat al-·∏•adi·π≠ an-na«ßdƒ´ya''.&lt;ref&gt;Cairo, Ma·π≠b. al-ManƒÅr, 1342/1924&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the teachings of the Yemeni alim [[Muhammad ash-Shawkani]] (1759‚Äì1839), which had already been discussed since the 1880s, gained greater publicity. Likewise, the writings of the [[Hanbali]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (1263‚Äì1328) came to attention again. Ibn Taymiyyah's doctrine provided a link between the [[Wahhabism|''wahhabiyya'']] and parts of the [[Salafi movement|''salafiyya'']] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Reinhard Schulze|title=Geschichte der Islamischen Welt von 1900 bis zur Gegenwart|publisher=C.

Beck| PublicationPlace=M√ºnchen| At=pp.&amp;nbsp;111‚Äì117| isbn=978-3-406-68855-3|date=2016| language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theological differences between the two movements were altogether too large for a complete union of the two doctrines. However, the opening of the Salafi movement towards Wahhabism helped to reconcile the latter with the Islamic public after king [[Ibn Saud]]'s invasion of the [[Hijaz]] in 1924. Central Arabian militia (''[[Ikhwan|I·∏´wƒÅn]]'') had occupied and looted the holy towns of Mecca and Medina, thereby destroying monuments which they considered pagan ''("[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]")''. Starting with the Pan-Islamic Congress in Mecca in 1926, the pro-Saudi movement developed into one of the most relevant currents of Islamic thought.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In his Egyptian exile, the Syrian alim [[Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi| øAbd ar-RahmƒÅn al-KawƒÅkibƒ´]] (1854‚Äì1902) met al-AfghƒÅnƒ´,  øAbduh and  RidƒÅ. In his books ''·π¨abƒÅ æi ø al-istibdƒÅd'' ("The nature of despotism") and ''Umm al-QurƒÅ'' ("Mother of villages [i.e., Mecca]", 1899) he accused the Ottoman sultan [[Abd√ºlhamid II]] of corrupting the [[Ummah|Islamic community]]. The Ottoman despotism "encroaches on the rights of its citizens, keeps them ignorant to keep them passive, [and] denies their right to take an active part in human life".&lt;ref name="Hourani_2001_PP272_273"&gt;Al-KawƒÅkibƒ´'s thoughts are cited as summarised in: {{cite book| last1=Hourani| first1=Albert| title=Arabic thought in the liberal age, 1798‚Äì1939| date=2001| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| isbn=978-0-521-27423-4| pages=272‚Äì273| edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the law must be reformed. By the use of ''ijtihad'', a "modern and unified system of law" must be created, and "proper religious education" must be provided. Because of the central position of the Arabic peoples in the ''ummah'' and the Arabic language in the intellectual discourse, but also because "Arabian Islam is&amp;nbsp;... free from modern corruptions and the [[bedouin]] are free from the moral decay and passivity of despotism", the balance of power must shift from the Turks towards the Arabs. The Ottoman dynasty must give up their claim to the [[Ottoman caliphate|caliphate]], and a new caliph of [[Quraysh]] descent must be elected by representatives of the ''ummah''. His temporal authority would be set up in the [[Hejaz]], whilst he would hold religious authority over the entire Muslim community, "assisted&amp;nbsp;... by a consultative council nominated by the Muslim rulers".&lt;ref name="Hourani_2001_PP272_273"/&gt;

Al-KawƒÅkibƒ´s idea that the Arabian doctrine represented a more puristic form of the Islam, according to Cleveland and Bunton (2016), prepared the ground for the 20th century [[Arab nationalism]] as well as the Islamic renewal movement of the [[Nahda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=William L.

Since the 1980, the Nahdlatul Ulama schools also offered degrees in economy, jurisdiction, paedagogical and medical sciences. In the 1990s, under their leader [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], the organization adopted an anti-fundamentalistic doctrine, teaching democracy and pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Azyumardi Aura, Dina Afrianty, Robert W.

[[Darul Uloom Deoband]], next to al-Azhar one of the most influential madrasas, was founded in the city of [[Deoband]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], in 1867. Initially, the intention of the school was to help Indian Muslims, who had become subjects of the British Empire after 1857, to lead their lives according to Islamic law. The Deobandi propagate a Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school, which was the most prevalent madhhab in South Asia. Still today, they aim at a revival of the Islamic society and education. Following the example of Deoband, thousands of madrasas were founded during the late 19th century which adopted the Deobandi way of studying fundamental texts of Islam and commenting on Quran and Hadith. By referring back to traditional Islamic scholars, the Deobandi School aims at defending the traditional Islamic madhhab, especially the Hanafi, against criticism which arose from other Islamic schools like the [[Ahl-i Hadith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Barbara Daly Metcalf| title=Islamic revival in British India: Deoband, 1860‚Äì1900| publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton, NJ| date=1982| isbn=978-0-19-566049-4| url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/33813}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, the Afghan ''taliban'' also referred to the Deoband School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barbara D.

[[Ahl-i Hadith]] is a movement which emerged in North India in the mid-19th century.

===Ulama in the secular national states of the 20th century===
In most countries, the classical institution of the madrasa as a place of teaching remained largely intact until the beginning of the 20th century. In the Western parts of the Islamic world, national states arose from the disintegration and partition of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. The government of [[Kemalism|kemalist]] Turkey sought to distance the nation from the religious traditions and institutions of the Ottoman past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Jenny B. White| title=Islam and politics in contemporary Turkey. In: Re≈üat Kasaba (Ed.): The Cambridge History of Turkey. Vol. 4: Turkey in the modern world| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK| year=2008| isbn=978-0-521-62096-3| page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, the establishment of a state-controlled educational system had already begun in the 1820s.&lt;ref name="Dallal_NCHoI"/&gt; From 1961 onwards, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] tried to increase the state control over ancient Islamic institutions like al-Azhar university. The head of al-Azhar was ‚Äì and still is ‚Äì appointed directly by the president, and new faculties were created in this ancient Islamic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Muhammad Qasim Zaman| title=The  øulamƒÅ'.

Initially giving rise to modernist reforms, up to a certain degree the state-sponsored faculties were able to retain their independence from government control. However, as Pierret has pointed out in detail for Syria,&lt;ref name="Pierret_2015_22"&gt;{{cite book| author=Thomas Pierret| title=Religion and state in Syria. The Sunni ulama from coup to revolution| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK| year=2013| isbn=978-1-107-60990-7| page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some countries the orthodox madrasa system remained largely intact, its decentralised organisation protecting it from state control. In fact, the government's attempt at controlling the religious education focussed largely on the academic institutions and neglected the traditional madrasas. By their continuing ability to provide social support and access to an educational alternative which was propagated as being more orthodox according to Islamic faith, the traditional ulama not only maintained their influence on large parts of the population, but actually increased their political influence and power.&lt;ref name="Pierret_2015_22"/&gt;

====Republic of Turkey====
In the kemalist Republic of [[Turkey]], traditional Ottoman religious institutions were abolished like the [[Ottoman Caliphate]], the office of the Shaykh ul-Islam, as well as the dervish [[Tariqa|brotherhoods]]. The [[Presidency of Religious Affairs]] ({{lang-tr|Diyanet ƒ∞≈üleri Ba≈ükanlƒ±ƒüƒ±}}, or Diyanet) was created in 1924 by article 136 of the [[Constitution of Turkey]] by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] as a successor to the office of the Shaykh ul-Islam.&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;{{cite web | author=Hata Sayfasi | url=http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/images/loaded/pdf_dosyalari/THE_CONSTITUTION_OF_THE_REPUBLIC_OF_TURKEY.pdf | title=The Constitution of the Republic of Turkey | publisher=Anayasa.gov.tr | date= | accessdate=2017-04-23 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607054813/http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/images/loaded/pdf_dosyalari/THE_CONSTITUTION_OF_THE_REPUBLIC_OF_TURKEY.pdf | archivedate=2013-06-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1925 onwards, the traditional [[dervish]] [[khanqah|tekke]]s and Islamic schools were dissolved. Famous convents like the [[Mevlana Museum|Tekke of the Mevlevi order in Konya]] were secularized and turned into museums.&lt;ref&gt;Law Nr.&amp;nbsp;677 of 30 November 1925 concerning the prohibition and the closure of the dervish convents, monasteries and mausolea, the prohibition of the office of the mausoleum wardens and the awarding and holding of certain titles. [[T.C. Resmi Gazete]] Nr 243, 13 December 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
In Iran, contrary to many other Islamic countries, the Shi'a ulama had maintained their religious authority together with considerable sources of income by waqf endowments and the zakat tax. Thus, they maintained their ability to exert political pressure. Between 1905 and 1911, a coalition of ulama, [[bazaari]], and some radical reformers incited the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]], which led to the establishment of the [[Majlis of Iran|parliament (majlis) of Iran]] during the [[Qajar Dynasty]].{{sfn|Amanat|1992|pages=163‚Äì176}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | article = Constitutional revolution | authorlink = | url = https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/constitutional-revolution-index | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. VI, Fasc. 2 | pages = 163‚Äì216 | location = | publisher = | year = 1992 | isbn = |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] in Iran was led by a senior [[Shia]] cleric‚Äîthe [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]‚Äîwho established an Islamic Republic whose constitution calls for a cleric as the country's [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Ruler]].

====Syria====
In his study on "Religion and state in Syria" (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Thomas Pierret| title=Religion and state in Syria. The Sunni ulama from coup to revolution| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK| year=2013| isbn=978-1-107-60990-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierret pointed out how the training of Syria's ulama gradually became more institutionalised, based upon the traditional madrasa system: In 1920, the madrasa of the [[Khusruwiyah Mosque]] complex (which was to be destroyed in 2014 during the [[Syrian Civil War]]) introduced an entrance exam and a stable curriculum for its Islamic seminary. Graduates were issued a diploma carrying the name of the institution, which bore the signatures of all teachers, signifying individual ''ijazah''. In 1947, courses also included natural sciences and foreign languages. In 1947, the state-run "Faculty of Sharia" was initiated in Damascus by Kamil al-Qassab (1853‚Äì1954), a former student of [[Muhammad Abduh|Mu·∏•ammad  øAbduh]] (1849‚Äì1905) in Cairo. Until 1954, all Syrian ulama aiming at higher degrees had to join [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo. In 1954, however, Syria's first higher faculty of sharia was founded by members of the modernist wing of the [[Muslim Brotherhood of Syria|Muslim Brotherhood]]. Its curriculum, which included economy and the "current situation of the Muslim world", according to Pierret, "anticipated the 1961 modernist reform of al-Azhar by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]". In 1972, the curriculum of the state-run "Sharia high schools" was reformed again, thus providing access for their students to all faculties of Syrian high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Thomas Pierret| title=Religion and state in Syria. The Sunni ulama from coup to revolution| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK| year=2013| isbn=978-1-107-60990-7| pages=35‚Äì37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pierret (2015), the [[Ba'ath Party]] coup of 1963 brought about a weakening of the state-controlled sharia high schools by the secular government. Many teachers of the Damascus faculty of sharia were forced into exile during the 1960s. Attempts of the regime during the 1980s at changing the curricula of the faculty and create a new "Ba'athist ulama" failed. The faculty, maintaining their ability to recruit competent teachers, was able to resist the political pressure. Consequently, the Syrian government prohibited the faculty to grant doctorates until 1998, and delayed the establishment of another faculty in Aleppo until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Thomas Pierret| title=Religion and state in Syria.

====Tunisia, Egypt, Iraq====
In 1961, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] put the Al-Azhar University under the direct control of the state. "Azharis were given military uniforms and found themselves marching in step under the orders of army officers."&lt;ref name=kepel-53&gt;{{cite book| last1=Kepel| first1=Gilles| title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|date=2002| publisher=I.B.Tauris.| page=53| url=https://books.google.com/?id=OLvTNk75hUoC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=kepel+Jihad:+The+Trail+of+Political+Islam+military+uniforms+and+found+themselves#v=onepage&amp;q=kepel%20Jihad%3A%20The%20Trail%20of%20Political%20Islam%20military%20uniforms%20and%20found%20themselves&amp;f=false| accessdate=10 September 2015| isbn=9781845112578}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the independence of [[Algeria]], President [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] also deprived the Algerian ulama of their power.

====Pakistan====
When in the 1980s and 1990s the inner-Islamic conflict escalated in [[Pakistan]] between Sunnite and Shiite sectarians, Islamic organizations represented the religious and political frontiers, and spread their ideas in the [[Madrassas in Pakistan|madrasas]] which they sponsored. Graduates ''(talib)'' from North Pakistani madrasas like "[[Mullah]]" [[Mohammed Omar]] played a role in the establishment of the Afghan [[Taliban]] regime as well as in the development of the radical [[Islamic terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Ahmed Rashid| title=Taliban: Islam, Oil and the New Great Game in Central Asia| publisher=I.B.

===Islamic revival and the origin of extremism===
[[File:Students recite surahs during Quran studies class.JPG|thumb|Quran studies class in the [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore]]
Islam, unlike Christianity, does not know a centralised process of [[ordination]] of its clergy. The traditional way of education and training relied largely on personal relationships between a teacher and his students. Whenever Islamic national governments tried to influence their regional ulama, they did so by controlling their income, or by establishing state-controlled schools and high schools. Traditional madrasas, representing merely decentralised "places of learning" and not institutions comparable to Western universities, often remained beyond state control. Whenever the state failed to control the resources of the madrasas, e.g., by controlling the income from religious endowments, or collecting Muslim taxes on behalf of the clergy, the ulama also retained the independence of their teaching. In particular, this held to be true in the Arabian provinces of the Ottoman Empire and the Arabian national states which arose out of the empire after the First World War.

For many people living in the poorer Islamic countries of today, especially those without natural resources like [[petroleum]], the madrasa system, privately sponsored by foreign aid and not or insufficiently controlled by the state, often constitutes their only access to some form of education and social rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Tariq Rahman| title=Denizens of Alien Worlds: A Study of Education, Inequality and Polarization in Pakistan| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2004| isbn=978-0-19-597863-6| page=Section 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabian humanitarian organizations use the madrasas they sponsor to spread their  [[Wahhabism|wahhabitic]] doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=David Commins| title=The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia| publisher=I.

==Modern challenges==
Some opinions from within the Muslim world have criticized the lack of scientific training of the ulama, and argued that those proficient in the sciences should qualify for this title.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bunglawala|first1=Inayat|title=Islam must engage with science, not deny it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/mar/09/islam-science-evolution|agency=The Guardian|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt, the Al-Azhar University has begun to introduce scientific and practical subjects in its traditional theological colleges to help the ulama face the challenges of the modern world. N. Hanif states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A religious hierarchy on the defensive against nationalists, secularists, modernists, apologists fundamentalists and romantics, and, possibly even in the bad books of the government of the day, trained only to transmit traditional knowledge in a parrot-like fashion is not likely to use its influence with the broad masses for the promotion of a modern approach to social and political life.&lt;ref name="Islam and Modernity"&gt;{{cite book|last1=HanifÃâ |first1=N. |title=Islam and Modernity|page=318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RZROS_RT6SEC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=ulama+have+no+scientific+training#v=snippet&amp;q=ulama&amp;f=false|isbn=9788176250023 |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sofia - Odrysian Wreath from Golyamata Mogila.jpg|thumb|upright|A golden wreath and ring from the burial of an [[Odrysian]] Aristocrat at the Golyamata Mogila in the [[Yambol]] region of Bulgaria. Mid 4th century BC.]]

A '''wreath''' (''pronunciation'': /…πiÀêŒ∏/) is an assortment of [[flower]]s, [[Leaf|leaves]], [[fruit]]s, [[twig]]s, or various materials that are constructed to resemble a ring.&lt;ref name="freedict"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wreath|title=Wreath |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English-speaking countries, wreaths are used typically as household ornaments, mainly as an [[Christmas decoration|Advent and Christmas decoration]]. They are also used in ceremonial events in many cultures around the globe. They can be worn as a [[Corolla (chaplet)|chaplet]] around the head, or as a [[garland]] around the neck. Wreaths have much history and symbolism associated with them. They are usually made from [[evergreen]]s and symbolize strength, as evergreens last even throughout the harshest winters. [[Bay laurel]] may also be used, and these wreaths are known as [[laurel wreath]].

== Etymology ==

The word wreath comes from Middle English ''wrethe'' and from Old English ''writha'', ''band''.&lt;ref name="freedict" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Ancient Etruscan wreaths ===

[[File:Ivy wreath BM 2296.jpg|thumb|Wreath with ivy leaves and berries, a [[satyr]]'s head at either end. Gold sheet, Etruscan artwork, 400‚Äì350 BC. From a tomb near [[Tarquinia]].]]

Wreaths were a design used in ancient times in southern Europe. The most well-known are pieces of [[Etruscan civilization]] jewelry, made of gold or other precious metals. Symbols from Greek myths often appear in the designs, embossed in precious metal at the ends of the wreath. Ancient Roman writers referred to Etruscan ''corona sutilis'', which were wreaths with their leaves sewn onto a background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Higgins|first=Reynold Alleyne|title=Greek and Roman Jewellery|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03601-7|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; These wreaths resemble a [[diadem]], with thin metal leaves being attached to an ornamental band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deppert-Lippitz|first1=Barbara|first2=Anne R. |last2=Bromberg|first3=John |last3=Dennis|title=Ancient gold jewelry at the Dallas Museum of Art|year=1996|publisher=Dallas Museum of Art in association with the University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-936227-19-1|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wreaths also appear stamped into Etruscan medallions. The plants shown making the wreaths in Etruscan jewelry include ivy, oak, olive leaves, myrtle, laurel, wheat and vines.

Wreaths were worn as crowns by Etruscan rulers. The Etruscan symbolism continued to be used in Ancient Greece and Rome. Roman magistrates also wore golden wreaths as crowns, as a symbolic testament to their lineage back to Rome's early Etruscan rulers. Roman magistrates also used several other prominent Etruscan symbols in addition to a golden wreath crown: [[fasces]], a curule chair, a purple [[toga]], and an ivory rod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadas|first=Moses|title=A History of Latin Literature|year=1952|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-01848-7|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo with his laurel wreath.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A replica bust of [[Apollo]] wearing a laurel wreath.]]

In the [[Greco-Roman world]], wreaths were used as an adornment that could represent a person‚Äôs occupation, rank, their achievements and status. The wreath that was commonly used was the [[laurel wreath]]. The use of this wreath comes from the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] involving [[Apollo]], Zeus‚Äô son and the god of life and light, who fell in love with the nymph [[Daphne]]. When he pursued her she fled and asked the river god [[Peneus]] to help her. Peneus turned her into a laurel tree. From that day, Apollo wore a wreath of laurel on his head. Laurel wreaths became associated with what Apollo embodied; victory, achievement and status and would later become one of the most commonly used symbols to address achievement throughout Greece and Rome. Laurel wreaths were used to crown victorious athletes at the original [[Olympic Games]]&lt;ref name="Batchen 2006 92"&gt;{{cite book|last=Batchen|first=Geoffrey|title=Forget Me Not: Photography and Remembrance|year=2006|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1-56898-619-7|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are still worn in Italy by university students who just graduated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.jh.edu/~gazette/2009/08june09/08saisgraduation.html |title=Crowning glories |accessdate=October 25, 2016 |quote=Six graduates of SAIS' Bologna Center joined the long tradition on May 29, when they, too, were crowned with the aromatic green wreaths.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of plants used to make wreath crowns also had symbolic meaning. For example, [[oak]] leaves symbolized wisdom, and were associated with [[Zeus]], who according to Greek mythology made his decisions while resting in an oak grove. The [[Twelve Tables]], dating to 450 BC, refer to funeral wreaths as a long-standing tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/sps/sps01_1.htm|title=The Laws of the Twelve Tables |accessdate=February 14, 2013 |quote=Anyone who has rendered himself deserving of a wreath ... shall have a right to have the said wreath placed upon his dead body}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olive wreath]] was the prize for the winner at the [[ancient Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/11/ga115.html ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒØŒøŒπ ŒüŒªœÖŒºœÄŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒØ ŒëŒ≥œéŒΩŒµœÇ: ŒüŒπ œÑŒπŒºŒ≠œÇ œÉœÑŒøœÖœÇ ŒüŒªœÖŒºœÄŒπŒøŒΩŒØŒ∫ŒµœÇ.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvest wreaths, a common household decoration today, are a custom with ancient roots in Europe. The creation of harvest wreaths in Europe can be traced back to ancient times, and is associated with [[animistic]] spiritual beliefs. In Ancient Greece, the harvest wreath was a sacred amulet, using wheat or other harvested plants, woven together with red and white wool thread. The harvest wreath would be hung by the door year-round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 16|origyear=1916|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-3693-9|pages=778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvest wreaths were an important symbol to the community in Ancient Greece, not merely to the farmer and his family. The festivals devoted to [[Dionysus]], the [[Oschophoria]] and [[Anthesteria]], included a ritual procession called the ''eires√Æon√™''. A harvest wreath was carried to [[Pyanopsia]] and [[Thargelia]] by young boys, who would sing during the journey. The laurel or olive wreath would be hung at the door, and then offerings were made to [[Helios]] and the Hours. It was hoped that this ritual would bring protection against crop failure and plagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell-Boyask|first=Robin|title=Plague and the Athenian imagination: drama, history and the cult of Asclepius|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-87345-1|pages=50‚Äì1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Poland, the harvest wreath (''wieniec'') is a central symbol of the Harvest Festival, ''Dozynki''. Wreaths are made of different shapes and sizes, using harvested grain plants, fruit and nuts. The wreath is then brought to a church for a blessing by a priest. The tradition includes a procession to the family home from the church, with a girl or young woman leading the procession and carrying the wreath. The procession is followed with a celebration and feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zamojska-Hutchins|first=Danuta|title=Cooking the Polish Way|year=2002|publisher=Lerner Publications|isbn=978-0-8225-4119-6|pages=16‚Äì17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine, Hungary, and other Eastern Europe cultures also have similar rituals that began as part of pre-Christian culture.

=== Advent and Christmas wreaths ===

In Christianity, wreaths are used to observe the [[Advent]] season, in preparation for [[Christmastide]] and [[Epiphanytide]], as well as to celebrate the latter two [[liturgical season]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Advent", Harper's Magazine (New York: Harper and Brothers Publishing, 1896) p. 776&lt;/ref&gt; These wreaths, as with other Advent and Christmas decorations, are often set up on the [[Advent Sunday|first Sunday of Advent]],&lt;ref name="Michelin2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Michelin|first=|title=Germany Green Guide Michelin 2012-2013|quote=Advent - The four weeks before Christmas are celebrated by counting down the days with an advent calendar, hanging up Christmas decorations and lightning an additional candle every Sunday on the four-candle advent wreath.|date=10 October 2012|publisher=Michelin |isbn=9782067182110|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Normark1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Christmas|last=Normark|first=Helena|year=1997|publisher=Graphic Garden|quote=Christmas in Sweden starts with Advent, which is the await for the arrival of Jesus.

Most people start putting up the Christmas decorations on the first of Advent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a custom that is sometimes done liturgically, through a [[hanging of the greens]] ceremony.&lt;ref name="RiceHuffstutler2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=Howard L.|last2=Huffstutler|first2=James C.|title=Reformed Worship|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|language=English |isbn=9780664501471|page=197|quote=Another popular activity is the "Hanging of the Greens," a service in which the sanctuary is decorated for Christmas.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Advent wreath]] was first used by [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] in Germany in the 16th century,&lt;ref name="Colbert1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Colbert|first=Teddy|title=The Living Wreath|year=1996|publisher=Gibbs Smith|isbn=9780879057008|quote=It is believed that the European advent wreath began as a Lutheran innovation in the sixteenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1839, Lutheran priest [[Johann Hinrich Wichern]] used a wreath made from a cart wheel to educate children about the meaning and purpose of [[Christmas]], as well as to help them count its approach, thus giving rise to the modern version of the Advent wreath. For every Sunday of Advent, starting with the fourth Sunday before Christmas, he would put a white candle in the wreath and for every day in between he would use a red candle.&lt;ref name="Mosteller2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosteller|first=Angie |title=Christmas|year=2008|publisher=Itasca Books|language=English|isbn=9781607910084|pages=167|quote=The first clear association with Advent is generally attributed to German Lutherans in the 16th century. However, another three centuries would pass before the modern Advent wreath took shape. Specifically, a German theologian and educator by the name of Johann Hinrich Wichern (1808-1881) is credited with the idea of lighting an increasing number of candles as Christmas approached.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscatholic.org/articles/201511/why-are-advent-candles-pink-and-purple-30471|title=Why are Advent candles pink and purple?|last=Manning|first=Kathleen|date=25 November 2015|publisher=[[Claretians|U.S. Catholic Magazine]]|language=English|accessdate=31 January 2016|quote=The modern Advent wreath, created in 19th-century Germany by Johann Hinrich Wichern, featured red and white candles. While these colors may be more in keeping with traditional Christmas d√©cor, they were most likely used because they were just what was available. A Lutheran pastor, Wichern was actively involved in the Inner Mission movement, which promoted the development of social service organizations for the poor. In 1839 students at a school Wichern established for poor boys in Hamburg kept asking him when Christmas would arrive. Using an old cart wheel, Wichern crafted a wreath of four large white candles, with small red candles between them. The children would light a new candle each day, and a new white candle on each of the four Sundays of Advent. When all the candles had been lit, it was time to celebrate Christmas.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the Advent wreath has since spread from the [[World Lutheran Federation|Lutheran Church]] to many [[Christian denominations]],&lt;ref name="BrighentiJr.2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brighenti|first1=Kenneth|last2=Trigilio, Jr.|first2=John|title=The Catholicism Answer Book|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Sourcebooks|language=English |isbn=9781402232299|page=369|quote=Historically, the Advent wreath is a Lutheran custom dating back three hundred years ago.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bower2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bower|first=Peter C.|title=The Companion to the Book of Common Worship|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Geneva Press|language=English |isbn=9780664502324|page=98|quote=It apparently emanated from the Lutheran tradition, but it has been appropriated by almost all other traditions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some of these traditions, such as the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Moravian Church]], have introduced unique variations to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscatholic.org/articles/201511/why-are-advent-candles-pink-and-purple-30471|title=Why are Advent candles pink and purple?|last=Manning|first=Kathleen|date=25 November 2015|publisher=[[Claretians|U.S. Catholic Magazine]]|language=English|accessdate=31 January 2016|quote=Other Christian churches soon adapted the wreath for their own needs and understandings of the season. To reinforce the symbolism of the liturgical vestments worn by priests, Catholics swapped the red candles for three purple candles‚Äîthe color typically associated with penance‚Äîand one pink, the color of rejoicing worn on the third Sunday of Advent. In Orthodox Christian churches, where the observance of Advent lasts 40 days, the wreath has six candles that are green (faith), blue (hope), gold (love), white (peace), purple (penance), and red (communion). Members of the Moravian Church use four plain beeswax candles that can be made at home, reflecting a faith tradition that values simplicity and domestic work.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the Advent wreaths, however, have four candles, and many of them have a white candle in the centre, the Christ candle, which is lit on [[Christmas Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/living-news/2010/11/birmingham_catholic_bishop_rob.html|title=Birmingham Catholic Bishop Robert J.

"Hope is needed in our culture," Baker said. "People are struggling economically. People are in dire need of hope." For Christians, that hope comes from the birth of Jesus, he said. For the first week, there is one purple candle lit on the Advent wreath every day. Another is added the second week. A pink candle is lit the third week, another purple candle the fourth week. The three purple candles and the pink candle are all lit on the last Sunday before Christmas and throughout that week. A white candle at the center of most Advent wreaths, the Christ candle, is lit on Christmas day, Baker said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advent and Christmas wreaths are constructed of evergreens to represent [[Eternal life (Christianity)|everlasting life]] brought through [[Jesus]] and the circular shape of the wreath represents God, with no beginning and no end.&lt;ref name="Mosteller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosteller|first=Angie |title=Christmas|year=2008|publisher=Itasca Books|language=English|isbn=9781607910084|pages=167|quote=Wreaths became distinctly Christian in their symbolism. Since their circular shape had no beginning or end, they could serve as a reminder of the 'Eternal God' (Genesis 21:33) and the life without end offered to 'whoever believes in the Son' (John 3:36). Since wreaths were made of evergreens (trees that survive the 'death' of winter), they could symbolize both the immortality of God and the souls of men.

=== Funeral and memorial wreaths ===

[[File:People gathered at the grave of Andrei Sakharov, 1990.jpg|thumb|right|Wreaths are mounted on frames near the Moscow grave of Russian intellectual [[Andrei Sakharov]], 1990]]

The symbolism of wreaths has been used at funerals since at least the time of Ancient Greece, to represent a circle of eternal life. Evergreen wreaths were laid at the burial place of early Christian virgin martyrs in Europe, the evergreen representing the victory of the eternal spirit over death.&lt;ref name="Batchen 2006 92"/&gt;

In early modern England, a wreath custom existed for the funerals of "young maidens". A young woman of the same age as the one being mourned would lead the funeral procession, carrying a wreath of white flowers to represent the purity of the deceased, and "that eternal crown of glory reserved for her in heaven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hulme|first=Frederick Edward|title=Bards and blossoms; or, The poetry, history, and associations of flowers|year=1877|publisher=Marcus Ward &amp; Co|location=Oxford University|pages=50‚Äì1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Victorian era, the symbolism of flowers had grown to become an elaborate language, and the symbolism of funeral wreaths was no exception. Flowers represented life and resurrection. Specific flowers were used in funeral wreaths to represent particular sentiments. Cypress and willow were used for crafting wreath frames, and were associated with mourning by the Victorians.&lt;ref name="Batchen 2006 92"/&gt;

Wreaths are commonly laid at the tombs of soldiers and at memorial [[cenotaphs]] during [[Memorial Day]] and [[Remembrance Day]] ceremonies. Wreaths may also be laid in memory of persons lost at sea, either from an accident or due to navy action. In a memorial service at sea, the wreath is lowered to the water and set adrift.

== Wreaths worn as crowns ==
{{see also|Wreath (attire)}}

A wreath may be used as a [[headdress]] made from leaves, flowers and branches. It is typically worn in festive occasions and on [[holy days]]. Wreaths originally were made for use with [[pagan]] rituals in Europe, and were associated with the changing seasons and fertility. Christianity accepted the symbolism of the wreath based upon its Roman association with honour and moral virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=The Culture of Flowers|year=1993|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-41441-8|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages, Christian art featured depictions of the [[Virgin Mary]] and various saints crowned with wreaths, much as figures from Roman and Greek mythology were depicted wearing wreaths, as well as Roman and Greek rulers and heroes.

=== Maypole wreath ===

[[File:Maypole.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Maypole]] with wreaths, raised for [[Midsummer]] celebrations in √ñstra Insj√∂, [[Dalarna|Dalarna, Sweden]]]]

Wreath customs in Europe have survived over many centuries. The observance of [[May Day]] in England includes [[Maypole]] festivities, culminating in a race by young unmarried men to climb to the top of the Maypole to capture the May Day wreath perched at the top of the pole.  The winner of this contest would wear the wreath as his crown, and would be recognized as the May Day King for the rest of the holiday. Plants traditionally used to make Midsummer wreaths and garlands include white lilies, green [[birch]], [[fennel]], [[St. John's Wort]], [[Artemisia annua|wormwood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/cropfactsheets/artemisia.pdf |title=Data sheet about Artemisia annua |publisher=[[Purdue University]] |last1=Ferreira |first1=Jorge |last2=Janick |first2=Jules |year=2009 |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[vervain]] and [[flax]]. The flowers used in making the [[Midsummer]] wreath had to be picked early in the morning before the dew had dried; the belief was that once the dew dried, the magical properties of the plants evaporated with the dew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=Adelma Grenier|title=A world of wreaths from Caprilands: the legend, lore, and design of traditional herbal wreaths|year=1994|publisher=JG Press|isbn=978-1-57215-000-3|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Midsummer]] celebrations are still observed in Germany and Scandinavia as well, with Maypoles and wreaths playing a prominent role, similar to England.

=== Wreath symbolism in England ===

By the [[Renaissance]] period, wreaths became symbols of political and religious alliances in England. Protestant reformers such as the Puritans saw wreaths and the holidays they were associated with, such as May Day, as being [[pagan]] corrupting influences that destroyed healthy Christian morality. Soldiers confiscated wreaths in Oxford on May Day of 1648.&lt;ref name="Goody"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=The Culture of Flowers|year=1993|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-41441-8|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Interregnum]] following the overthrow of [[Charles I of England]], wreaths symbolized Royalist sympathies. In [[Bath, Somerset]], the coronation of [[Charles II of England]] was marked with a procession of 400 maidens in white and green, carrying "gilded crowns, crowns made of flowers, and wreaths made of laurel mixed with tulips", and  led by the mayor's wife.&lt;ref name="Goody" /&gt;

=== Saint Lucy's Day crown ===

[[Saint Lucy]] is traditionally depicted in Christian artwork wearing a wreath as a crown, and on the wreath stand lit candles symbolizing the light of the world represented by Christ. Sweden in particular has a long history of observing [[Saint Lucy's Day]] (St. Lucia's Day). "St. Lucia's crowns", made of a brass wreath holding candles, are part of the customs associated with this holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=Adelma Grenier|title=A world of wreaths from Caprilands: the legend, lore, and design of traditional herbal wreaths|year=1994|publisher=JG Press|isbn=978-1-57215-000-3|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ajivika''' ([[IAST]]: '''{{IAST|ƒÄjƒ´vika}}''') is one of the [[ƒÄstika and nƒÅstika|nƒÅstika]] or "heterodox" schools of [[Indian philosophy]].&lt;ref name=natalia&gt;Natalia Isaeva (1993), Shankara and Indian Philosophy, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791412817}}, pages 20-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=james&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Ajivika", ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', Vol. 1: A‚ÄìM, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; Purportedly founded in the 5th century BCE by [[Makkhali Gosala]], it was a [[≈õrama·πáa]] movement and a major rival of [[early Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey D Long (2009), Jainism: An Introduction, Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-1845116255}}, page 199&lt;/ref&gt; ƒÄjƒ´vikas were organised renunciates who formed discrete communities.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=145-146}}

Original scriptures of the ƒÄjƒ´vika school of philosophy may once have existed, but these are currently unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Indian literature.{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}} Scholars question whether ƒÄjƒ´vika philosophy has been fairly and completely summarized in these secondary sources, as they were written by groups (such as the Buddhists and Jains) competing with and adversarial to the philosophy and religious practices of the Ajivikas.&lt;ref name=dundas/&gt; It is therefore likely that much of the information available about the ƒÄjƒ´vikas is inaccurate to some degree, and characterisations of them should be regarded carefully and critically.

Founded in what is now the northern Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], ƒÄjƒ´vika philosophy reached the height of its popularity during the rule of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] emperor [[Bindusara]], around the 4th century BCE. This school of thought thereafter declined, but survived for nearly 2,000 years through the 14th century CE in the southern Indian states of [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name=natalia/&gt;&lt;ref name=philtar/&gt;&lt;ref name=bashamzysk&gt;Arthur Basham, Kenneth Zysk (1991), ''The Origins and Development of Classical Hinduism'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195073492}}, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The ƒÄjƒ´vika philosophy, along with the [[CƒÅrvƒÅka]] philosophy, appealed most to the warrior, industrial and mercantile classes of ancient Indian society.&lt;ref name=riepe39&gt;DM Riepe (1996), ''Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
Ajivika (''ƒÄjƒ´vika'', Sanskrit: ‡§Ü‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï) is derived from Ajiva (''ƒÄjƒ´va'', ‡§Ü‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ) which literally means "livelihood, lifelong, mode of life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html AjIvika] Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoernle"&gt;A Hoernle, {{Google books|uiJBAQAAIAAJ|Encyclop√¶dia of Religion and Ethics, Volume 1|page=PA259}}, Editor: James Hastings, Charles Scribner &amp; Sons, Edinburgh, pages 259-268&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Ajivika'' means "those following special rules with regard to Iivelihood", sometimes connoting "religious mendicants" in ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts.&lt;ref name="natalia" /&gt;{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}} 

Aaseevagam (Tamil for Ajivika or Ajivikam)  can be split as aasu + eevu + agam. Where "aasu" means errorless, verified and available knowledge, "eevu" means solutions and "agam" means the place. Ajivika means a place where solutions are provided for problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaseevagam.blogspot.com/2008/05/blog-post.html|title=‡ÆÜ‡Æö‡ØÄ‡Æµ‡Æï ‡ÆÆ‡Æ∞‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æ©‡Øç ‡ÆÖ‡Æ¥‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æö‡Øç ‡Æö‡Æø‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=‡ÆÜ‡Æö‡ØÄ‡Æµ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æê‡ÆØ‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Æ≤‡Ææ‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç|last=Nedunchezhiyan|first=K|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name ''Ajivika'' for an entire philosophy resonates with its core belief in "no free will" and complete ''niyati'', literally "inner order of things, self-command, [[predeterminism]]", leading to the premise that good simple living is not a means to salvation or [[moksha]], just a means to true livelihood, predetermined profession and way of life.&lt;ref name=hoernle/&gt;&lt;ref name=jarl&gt;Jarl Charpentier (July 1913), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25189032 Ajivika], The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Cambridge University Press, pages 669-674&lt;/ref&gt; The name came to imply that school of Indian philosophy which lived a good simple mendicant-like livelihood for its own sake and as part of its predeterministic beliefs, rather than for the sake of after-life or motivated by any [[soteriology|soteriological]] reasons.{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;ref name=hoernle/&gt;

Some scholars spell Ajivika as Ajivaka.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Hinnells (1995), [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631181392_chunk_g97806311813922_ss1-32 Ajivaka], ''A New Dictionary of Religions'', Wiley-Blackwell Reference, {{ISBN|978-0631181392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
{{PaliCanonSamanaViews}}

ƒÄjƒ´vika philosophy is credited in ancient texts of Buddhism and Jainism to [[Makkhali Gosala]], a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] and [[Mahavira]].&lt;ref name=hoernle/&gt; Exact origins of ƒÄjƒ´vika is unknown, but generally accepted to be the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name=natalia/&gt;

Primary sources and literature of the ƒÄjƒ´vikas is lost, or yet to be found. Everything that is known about ƒÄjƒ´vika history and its philosophy is from secondary sources, such as the ancient and medieval texts of India.{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}} Inconsistent fragments of ƒÄjƒ´vika history is found mostly in Jain texts such as the ''Bhagvati Sutra'' and Buddhist texts such as the ''[[Sama√±√±aphala Sutta]]'', and [[Buddhaghosa]]'s commentary on Sammannaphala Sutta,&lt;ref name=hoernle/&gt;{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}} with a few mentions in Hindu texts such as Vayu Purana.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=122-123}}&lt;ref name=barua/&gt;

The ƒÄjƒ´vikas reached the height of their prominence in the late 1st millennium BCE, then declined, yet continued to exist in south India until the 14th Century CE, as evidenced by inscriptions found in southern India.&lt;ref name=james/&gt;&lt;ref name=philtar&gt;[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/ascetic/ajiv.html Ajivikas] World Religions Project, [[University of Cumbria]], United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient texts of Buddhism and Jainism mention a city in the 1st millennium BCE named [[Savatthi]] (Sanskrit ''≈öravasti'') as the hub of the ƒÄjƒ´vikas; it was located near [[Ayodhya]] in what is now the [[North India]]n state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. In later part of the common era, inscriptions suggests that the ƒÄjƒ´vikas had a significant presence in the [[South India]]n state of [[Karnataka]], prominently in Kolar district and some places of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name=philtar/&gt;

The ƒÄjƒ´vika philosophy spread rapidly in ancient South Asia, with a ''Sangha Geham'' (community center) for ƒÄjƒ´vikas on the island now known as [[Sri Lanka]] and also extending into the western state of [[Gujarat]] by the 4th century BCE, the era of the [[Maurya Empire]].{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=145-146}}

====Classification in Hindu philosophy====
Riepe refers to ƒÄjƒ´vikas as a distinct heterodox school of Indian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Riepe (1996), ''Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 34-46&lt;/ref&gt; Raju states that "ƒÄjƒ´vikas and [[CƒÅrvƒÅka]]s can be called [[Hindu]]s", and adds that "the word Hinduism has no definite meaning".&lt;ref&gt;P.T. Raju (1985), ''Structural Depths of Indian Thought'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, page 147&lt;/ref&gt; Epigraphical evidence suggests that emperor [[Ashoka]], in the 3rd century BCE, considered ƒÄjƒ´vikas to be more closely related to the schools of Hinduism than to Buddhists, Jainas or other Indian schools of thought.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=148-153}}

===Biography of Makkhali Gosala===
Makkhali Gosala ([[Pali]]; Sanskrit ''Go≈õala Maskariputra'', c. 484 BCE) is generally considered as the founder of the ƒÄjƒ´vika movement.&lt;ref name=james/&gt;{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}} Some sources state that Gosala was only a leader of a large ƒÄjƒ´vika congregation of ascetics, but not the founder of the movement himself.{{cn|date=May 2015}} The Swiss Indologist [[:sv:Jarl Charpentier|Jarl Charpentier]] and others suggest the ƒÄjƒ´vika tradition existed in India well before the birth of Makkhali Gosala, citing a variety of ancient Indian texts.&lt;ref name=jarl/&gt;

Gosala was born in [[Magadha]] and was the son of Mankha, a professional mendicant. His mother was BhaddƒÅ.{{Sfn|Basham|1951| p= 35}} His name Gosala "cowshed" refers to his humble birthplace.

{{quote|While BhaddƒÅ was pregnant, she and her husband Mankhali, the mankha, came to the village ... of Sarava·πáa, where dwelt a wealthy householder Gobahula. Mankhali left his wife and his luggage ... in Gobahula‚Äôs cowshed (''gosƒÅlƒÅ'') ... Since he could find no shelter elsewhere the couple continued to live in a corner of the cowshed, and it was there that BhaddƒÅ gave birth her child."{{Sfn|Basham|1951| p= 36}}}}

[[File:Ashoka pillar delhi2.png|thumb|260px|[[Ashoka]]'s Seventh Pillar Edict mentions Ajivikas.&lt;ref name=philtar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html The Edicts of King Ashoka] Ven. S. Dhammika, Colorado State University Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Above in the second column is the seventh edict in the [[Brahmi script]] (3rd century BCE).]]
[[File:Sudama and Lomas Rishi Caves at Barabar, Bihar, 1870.jpg|thumb|260px|The 3rd century BCE mendicant caves of the ƒÄjƒ´vikas (Barabar, near [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], Bihar).&lt;ref&gt;Pia Brancaccio (2014), Cave Architecture of India, in Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures, Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-007-3934-5}}, pages 1-9&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Gosala is described in ancient texts as a contemporary of [[Mahavira]], the 24th [[Tirthankara]] of [[Jainism]], and of [[Gautama Buddha]]. The Jain ''Bhagavati Sutra'' refers to him as Gosala Mankhaliputta ("son of Mankhali"). The text depicts Gosala as having been a disciple of Mahavira's for a period of six years, after which the two had a falling out and parted ways.&lt;ref name=hoernle/&gt; According to the ''Bhagvati Sutra'', Makkhali Gosala met with MahƒÅvƒ´ra again later in life, but Gosala asserted to Mahavira that he was not the same person. Makkhali Gosala referred to the example of a sesame plant which ‚Äúhad been pulled up, and had temporarily died, but it had been replanted and thus reanimated, becoming once more living, while the seven pods had developed‚Äù.{{Sfn|Basham|1951| p= 48}} GosƒÅla declared that the original GosƒÅla who was Mahavira's companion once was dead, and that the soul now inhabiting the apparent GosƒÅla in front of him was a reanimated, completely different Gosala.&lt;ref name=hoernle/&gt;{{Sfn|Basham|1951| p= 31}} This argument was declared a form of sophistry by Mahavira, and this led to a significant break in the relations between the two.

===Inscriptions and caves===
Several rock-cut caves belonging to ƒÄjƒ´vikas are dated to the times of the Mauryan emperor [[Ashoka]] (r. 273 BC to 232 BC). These are the oldest surviving cave temples of ancient India, and are called the [[Barabar Caves]] in Jehanabad district of [[Bihar]].&lt;ref name=ent&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/e/019pho000001003u0045a000.html Entrance to one of the Barabar Hill caves] ''[[British Library]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Barabar caves were carved out of granite, has a highly polished internal cave surfaces, and each consists of two chambers, the first is a large rectangular hall, the second is a small, circular, domed chamber. These were probably used for meditation.&lt;ref name=ent/&gt;

===Reliability of sources===
ƒÄjƒ´vikas competed with and debated the scholars of Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism. The ƒÄjƒ´vika movement is primarily from historical references left behind in Jain and Buddhist sources, that may therefore be hostile to it.&lt;ref name=philtar/&gt; It is unknown to what degree the available non-ƒÄjƒ´vika sources reflect the actual beliefs and practices of the ƒÄjƒ´vikas. Most of what is known about them was recorded in the literature of rival groups, modern scholars question the reliability of the secondary sources, and whether intentional distortions for dehumanization and criticism was introduced into the records.&lt;ref name=barua&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ajivikas00barurich#page/10/mode/2up The Ajivikas] BM Barua, University of Calcutta, pages 10-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dundas/&gt;

More recent work by scholars suggests that the ƒÄjƒ´vika were perhaps misrepresented by Jain and Buddhist sources.
{{quote|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Johannes Bronkhorst|Johannes Bronkhorst's]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; claim is that, whereas the Jains teach that one can both stop the influx of new karma and rid oneself of old karma through ascetic practice, GosƒÅla taught that one could only stop the influx of new karma. [...] Ascetic practice can be effective in preventing further karmic influx, which helps to explain the otherwise inexplicable fact that the ƒÄjƒ´vikas did practice asceticism. [...] [T]he popularity of the ƒÄjƒ´vika doctrine in ancient times, such that it could rival that of both Jainism and Buddhism, also make sense if this doctrine was really not so radically different from these traditions as its presentation in Jain and Buddhist sources suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jainism | publisher=I. B. Tauris | author=Long, Jeffery D | year=2009 | location=New York | pages=44 | isbn=978-1-84511-626-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paul Dundas states that the Jain and Buddhist texts cannot be considered reliable source of ƒÄjƒ´vika history and philosophy, because "it seems doubtful whether a doctrine [of Ajivikas] which genuinely advocated the lack of efficacy of individual effort could have formed the basis of a renunciatory path to spiritual liberation", and that "the suspicion must be that the Jains and Buddhists deliberately distorted Ajivika doctrine for their own polemical purposes".&lt;ref name=dundas&gt;Paul Dundas (2002), The Jains (The Library of Religious Beliefs and Practices), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415266055}}, pages 28-30&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other scholars&lt;ref name=hoernle/&gt; suggest that at least the common elements found about ƒÄjƒ´vikas in Jain and Buddhist literature may be considered, because Jainism and Buddhism were two different, competing and conflicting philosophies in ancient India.

==Philosophy==
[[File:Tile with Ajivaka (?) Ascetics LACMA M.82.152.jpg|thumb|Tile possibly representing Ajivika ascetics.]]
===Absolute determinism and no free will===
The problems of time and change was one of the main interests of the Ajivikas. Their views on this subject may have been influenced by Vedic sources, such as the hymn to ''Kala'' (Time) in [[Atharvaveda]].{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|p=142}} Both Jaina and Buddhist texts state that ƒÄjƒ´vikas believed in absolute determinism, absence of free will, and called this ''niyati''.&lt;ref name=james/&gt;{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}} Everything in human life and universe, according to Ajivikas, was pre-determined, operating out of cosmic principles, and true choice did not exist.{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;ref&gt;DM Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 42-45&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist and Jaina sources describe them as strict fatalists, who did not believe in [[karma]].&lt;ref name=james/&gt;&lt;ref name=philtar/&gt; The Ajivikas philosophy held that all things are preordained, and therefore religious or ethical practice has no effect on one‚Äôs future, and people do things because cosmic principles make them do so, and all that will happen or will exist in future is already predetermined to be that way. No human effort could change this ''niyati'' and the [[karma]] ethical theory was a fallacy.&lt;ref name=philtar/&gt; James Lochtefeld summarizes this aspect of Ajivika belief as, "life and the universe is like a ball of pre-wrapped up string, which unrolls until it was done and then goes no further".&lt;ref name=james/&gt;

Riepe states that the Ajivikas belief in predeterminism does not mean that they were pessimistic. Rather, just like Calvinists belief in predeterminism in Europe, the Ajivikas were optimists.&lt;ref name=riepeatom/&gt; The Ajivikas simply did not believe in the moral force of action, or in merits or demerits, or in after-life affected because of what one does or does not do. Actions had immediate effects in one's current life but without any moral traces, and both the action and the effect was predetermined, according to the Ajivikas.&lt;ref name=riepeatom/&gt;

Makkali Gosala seems to have combined the ideas of older schools of thought into an eclectic doctrine. He appears to have believed in ''niyati'' (destiny), ''svabhava'' (nature), and ''sangati'' (change), and possibly ''parinama'', which may have prompted other philosophical schools to label him variously as ''ahetuvadin'', ''vainayikavadin'', ''ajnanavadin'', and ''issarakaranavadin''.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|p=140-161}} According to him all beings undergo development (''parinama''). This culminates in the course of time (''samsarasuddhi'') in final salvation to which all beings are destined under the impact of the factors of ''niyati'' (destiny), ''bhava'' (nature), and ''sangati'' (change).{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|p=140-161}} As such destiny does not appear as the only player, but rather chance or indeterminism plays equal part in his doctrine. He thus subscribed to ''niyativada'' (fatalism) only in the sense that he thought that ''some'' future events like salvation for all were strictly determined.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|p=140-161}}

===Ajivikas and theism===
Ajivikas were an atheistic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bullivant and Michael Ruse (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Atheism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199644650}}, page 654&lt;/ref&gt; They did not presume any deity as the creator of the universe, or as prime mover, or that some unseen mystical end was the final resting place of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;GR Garg (1992), Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World, Volume 1, South Asia Books, {{ISBN|978-8170223740}}, page 281&lt;/ref&gt;

In later texts, the Tamil ''[[Neelakesi|Nƒ´lakƒìci]]'', a story of two divinities, Okkali and ≈åkali, relates the ƒÄjƒ´vikas instructed men in the scriptures.{{Sfn|Basham|1951| p= 272}}

Ajivikas believed that in every being there is a soul (Atman). However, unlike Jains and various orthodox schools of Hinduism that held that soul is formless, Ajivikas asserted that soul has a material form, one that helps meditation.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=269-273}} They also believed that the soul passes through many births and ultimately progresses unto its pre-destined ''nirvana'' (salvation).{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=248-256}} Basham states, that some texts suggest evidence of [[Vaishnavism]]-type devotional practices among some Ajivikas.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=276-280, 186}}

===Atomism===
Ajivikas developed a theory of elements and atoms similar to the [[Vaisheshika]] school of Hinduism. Everything was composed of minuscule atoms, according to Ajivikas, and qualities of things are derived from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=262-270}}

The description of Ajivikas atomism is inconsistent between those described in Buddhist and Hindu texts. According to three Tamil texts,&lt;ref name=riepeatom&gt;Dale Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 41-44 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; the Ajivikas held there exist seven ''kaya'' (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ø, assemblage, collection, elemental categories): ''pathavi-kaya'' (earth), ''apo-kaya'' (water), ''tejo-kaya'' (fire), ''vayo-kaya'' (air), ''sukha'' (joy), ''dukkha'' (sorrow) and ''jiva'' (life).{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=262-270}} The first four relate to matter, the last three non-matter. These elements are ''akata'' (that which is neither created nor destroyed), ''vanjha'' (barren, that which never multiplies or reproduces) and have an existence independent of the other.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=262-270}} The elements, asserts Ajivika theory in the Tamil text Manimekalai, are made of ''paramanu'' (atoms), where atoms were defined as that which cannot be further subdivided, that which cannot penetrate another atom, that which is neither created nor destroyed, that which retains its identity by never growing nor expanding nor splitting nor changing, yet that which moves, assembles and combines to form the perceived.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=262-270}}&lt;ref name=riepeatom/&gt;

The Tamil text of Ajivikas asserts that this "coming together of atoms can take diversity of forms, such as the dense form of a diamond, or a loose form of a hollow bamboo". Everything one perceives, states the atomism theory of Ajivikas, was mere juxtapositions of atoms of various types, and the combinations occur always in fixed ratios governed by certain cosmic rules, forming ''skandha'' (molecules, building blocks).{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=262-270}}&lt;ref name=riepeatom/&gt; Atoms, asserted the Ajivikas, cannot be seen by themselves in their pure state, but only when they aggregrate and form ''bhutas'' (objects).{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=262-270}} They further argued that properties and tendencies are characteristics of the objects. The Ajivikas then proceeded to justify their belief in determinism and "no free will" by stating that everything experienced ‚Äì ''sukha'' (joy), ''dukkha'' (sorrow) and ''jiva'' (life) ‚Äì is mere function of atoms operating under cosmic rules.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=262-270}}&lt;ref name=riepeatom/&gt;

Riepe states that the details of the Ajivikas theory of atomism provided the foundations of later modified atomism theories found in Jain, Buddhist and Hindu traditions.&lt;ref name=riepeatom/&gt;

===Antinomian ethics===
Another doctrine of Ajivikas philosophy, according to Buddhist texts, was their antinomian ethics, that is there exist "no objective moral laws".&lt;ref name=riepe39/&gt;{{sfn|Basham|1951|p=4}} Buddhaghosa summarizes this view as, "There is neither cause nor basis for the sins of living beings and they become sinful without cause or basis. There is neither cause nor basis for the purity of living beings and they become pure without cause or basis. All beings, all that have breath, all that are born, all that have life, are without power, or strength, or virtue, but are the result of destiny, chance and nature, and they experience joy and sorrow in six classes".&lt;ref name=riepe39/&gt;

Despite this ascribed premise of antinomian ethics, both Jain and Buddhist records note that ƒÄjƒ´vikas lived a simple ascetic life, without clothes and any material possessions.&lt;ref name=james/&gt;{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}}

Tamil literature on Ajivikas suggests that they practiced [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence) and a vegetarian lifestyle.{{sfn|Basham|1951|p=123}} Arthur Basham notes that Buddhist and Jaina texts variously accuse Ajivikas of immorality, unchastity and worldliness, but they also acknowledge the confusion among Buddhists and Jainas when they observed the simple, ascetic lifestyle of Ajivikas.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=123-127}}

==Scriptures==
The Ajivika had a fully elaborate philosophy, produced by its scholars and logicians, but those texts are lost.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=213-223}} Their literature evolved over the centuries, like other traditions of Indian philosophy, through the medieval era. The Pali and Prakrit texts of Buddhism and Jainism suggest that Ajivika theories were codified, some of which were quoted in commentaries produced by Buddhist and Jaina scholars.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=213-223}}

The main texts of the Ajivikas included the ten ''Purvas'' (eight ''Mahanimittas'', two ''Maggas'') and the ''Onpatu Katir''.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=213-223}} The ''Mahanimittas'' of Ajivikas, claims Bhagavati Sutra, was extracted from the teachings Gosala received from Mahavira, when he was a disciple.&lt;ref name=hoernle/&gt;

The belief of Ajivikas in absolute determinism and influence of cosmic forces led them to develop extensive sections in their Mahanimittas texts on mapping the sun, moon, planets, stars and their role in astrology and fortune telling.&lt;ref&gt;Kailash Chand Jain (2010), History of Jainism: Jainism before and in the age of MahƒÅvƒ´ra, {{ISBN|978-8124605486}}, pages 414-415&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=124-127}}

==Influence==
Isaeva states that the ideas of Ajivika influenced Buddhism and various schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=natalia/&gt; Riepe states an example of an influential Ajivika theory was its theory on atomism.&lt;ref name=riepeatom/&gt; Basham suggests Ajivikas may have possibly influenced the medieval era doctrines of Dvaita Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=149, 282, 327}}

==Conflict between Ajivikas, Buddhists and Jaina==
According to the 2nd century CE text ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', the Mauryan emperor [[Bindusara]] and his chief queen [[Shubhadrangi]] were believers of this philosophy, that reached its peak of popularity during this time. ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' also mentions that after his conversion to Buddhism, Bindusara's son [[Ashoka]] issued an order to kill all the Ajivikas in [[Pundravardhana]], enraged at a picture that depicted Gautama Buddha in a negative light. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order.&lt;ref name="John1989"&gt;{{cite book | author=John S. Strong | authorlink = John S.

An earlier Jaina text, the ''Bhagavati Sutra'', similarly mentions a debate, disagreement and then "coming to blows" between factions led by Mahavira and by Gosala.&lt;ref name=hoernle/&gt;
