"'''11001001'''" is the 14th episode of the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 1)|first season]] of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. It was first broadcast on February 1, 1988, in the United States in [[broadcast syndication]]. It was written by [[Maurice Hurley (screenwriter)|Maurice Hurley]] and [[Robert Lewin (screenwriter)|Robert Lewin]], and directed by [[Paul Lynch (director)|Paul Lynch]].

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the [[Starfleet]] starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]]. In this episode, members of an alien race called the [[Bynars]] hijack a nearly evacuated ''Enterprise'' while retrofitting the computer in space dock.

Make-up supervisor [[Michael Westmore]] created the look of the Bynars, who were four women in extensive make-up. The musical score was scored by [[Ron Jones (composer)|Ron Jones]]. Reviewers praised the Bynars themselves, and the response to the episode was generally positive, with one critic calling it the best of the season. It was awarded an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.

==Plot==
The [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] starship ''Enterprise'' arrives at [[Starbase (Star Trek)|Starbase]]&amp;nbsp;74 for a routine maintenance check. Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) and Commander [[William Riker]] ([[Jonathan Frakes]]) greet Starbase Commander Quinteros ([[Eugene Dynarski|Gene Dynarski]]) and two pairs of small humanoid aliens known as Bynars; the Bynars heavily rely on their computer technology and work in pairs for best efficiency. Much of the crew take shore leave while Picard, Riker and a skeleton crew remain aboard. Riker is intrigued by the Bynars' claimed upgrades to the [[holodeck]] and starts a program in a jazz bar. The program includes a woman named Minuet ([[Carolyn McCormick]]), by whom Riker is fascinated, both as a beautiful and charming woman, but also by the level of sophistication in her responses. Riker shortly returns, and Picard walks in on him kissing Minuet, and he too is amazed by the simulation.

Meanwhile, the Bynars discreetly create a catastrophic failure in the ship's warp core. Lt. Cmdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) and [[Geordi La Forge]] ([[LeVar Burton]]) are unable to locate Picard or Riker and, assuming them to already be on the Starbase, order an emergency evacuation. They set the ship to leave the Starbase and warp to a safe location before it would explode. However, once they are clear of the dock, the failure disappears and the ship sets course for the Bynar system, the planet Bynaus orbiting Beta Magellan. Data, La Forge, and Quinteros realize that the Bynars are still aboard the ship, but there are currently no other working vessels to follow them. Back on the ''Enterprise'', Riker and Picard leave the simulation to find the ship empty and at warp to the Bynar system, with the ship's controls locked to the bridge. Fearing that the Bynars have taken over the ship for nefarious purposes, they set the ship to self-destruct in 5 minutes and then take the bridge by inter-ship [[transporter (Star Trek)|transporter beam]] and find the Bynars there unconscious.

After cancelling the self-destruct, they find the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the ''Enterprise'' computers, but they are unable to decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation about what is going on as the ship nears the orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] it emitted would knock out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the ''Enterprise'' to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that [[Starfleet]] would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the ''Enterprise'' returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she is not the same as before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.

==Production==
[[File:ST-TNG 11001001.jpg|thumb|left|The Bynars were portrayed by young actresses in extensive make-up.]]
The name "11001001" is a [[binary number]], a contraction of the names of the Bynars (One One, Zero Zero, One Zero, and Zero One). The episode at one point was called "10101001".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurley|first=Maurice|author2=Lewin, Robert|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation "11001001"|url=http://www.st-minutiae.com/academy/literature329/116.txt|publisher=Paramount Pictures|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally intended that this episode would take place prior to "[[The Big Goodbye]]", with the Bynars' modifications causing the problems with the [[holodeck]] seen in that episode. Instead it was changed to the Bynars aiming to fix the holodeck to prevent those problems re-occurring.&lt;ref name=decandido/&gt; The Bynars themselves were played by young women.&lt;ref name=gross163&gt;[[#grossaltman1993|Gross; Altman (1993)]]: p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Children were considered for the parts, but the production team thought that it would be too problematic because of the limited time they could work each day and the need to hire teachers. Each actress was required to wear extensive make-up, which was created by make-up supervisor [[Michael Westmore]]. A large single-piece bald cap was made from the same mold for each actress, which required some customised trimming to get it to fit properly. To cover up problems with the seams of the cap, some fake hair was added on the Bynars' necks.&lt;ref name=westmore&gt;[[#westmorenazzaro1993|Westmore; Nazzaro (1993)]]: p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Each actress also controlled the flashing light inside the apparatus on the side of the headpiece through a battery pack attached to the waistband of their costumes.&lt;ref name=westmore/&gt; To disguise their voices, the pitch was lowered in post production. It was originally planned to add subtitles over the Bynars' conversations between themselves.&lt;ref name=nemecek48&gt;[[#Nemecek2003|Nemecek (2003)]]: p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of the [[Starbase]] orbiting a planet was re-used from ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]''.&lt;ref name=nemecek48/&gt; The score was created by [[Ron Jones (composer)|Ron Jones]], who incorporated jazz themes composed by [[John Beasley (musician)|John Beasley]].&lt;ref name=score&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation: The Ron Jones Project |titlelink= |others=Ron Jones |year=2010 |chapter= |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/notes/box05_disc02.html |accessdate=February 15, 2013 |first= |last= |authorlink= |first2= |last2= |authorlink2= |page= |pages= |type= |publisher=Film Score Monthly |id= |location= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050852/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/notes/box05_disc02.html |archivedate=March  4, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was written by [[Maurice Hurley (screenwriter)|Maurice Hurley]] and [[Robert Lewin (screenwriter)|Robert Lewin]]. Hurley was pleased with the outcome of the episode, praising the work of Westmore on the Bynars' makeup and the performance of Jonathan Frakes. Frakes enjoyed the episode too, saying, "A fabulous show. Those were the kind of chances we took first season that when they worked, they worked great. It was a very chancy show and I loved it."&lt;ref name=gross163/&gt; Director [[Paul Lynch (director)|Paul Lynch]] also thought that the Bynars were "great".&lt;ref name=gross163/&gt; [[Carolyn McCormick]] appeared as Minuet and subsequently became a regular cast member in [[Law &amp; Order|Law and Order]].&lt;ref name=gross163/&gt; She returned to the role of Minuet in the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 4)|season four]] episode "[[Future Imperfect]]". [[Eugene Dynarski|Gene Dynarski]] had previously appeared as Ben Childress in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[Mudd's Women]]" and Krodak in "[[The Mark of Gideon]]".&lt;ref name=nemecek48/&gt;

==Reception==
"11001001" aired in [[broadcast syndication]] during the week commencing February 7, 1988. It received [[Nielsen rating]]s of 10.7, reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot. These ratings were lower than both the episodes broadcast both before and afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Nielsen Ratings – Seasons 1–2|url=http://treknation.com/nielsens/tng/season12.shtml|website=''TrekNation''|publisher=UGO Networks|accessdate=June 12, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001005185203/http://treknation.com/nielsens/tng/season12.shtml|archivedate=October 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their work in this episode, Bill Wistrom, Wilson Dyer, Mace Matiosian, James Wolvington, Gerry Sackman and Keith Bilderbeck were awarded an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.&lt;ref name=emmydatabase&gt;{{cite web|title=Primetime Emmy Award Database|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search|publisher=Emmys.com|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it No. 6 on its list of the top 10 ''Star Trek'' episodes for the magazine's celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Logan |first=Michael |date=August 24, 1996 |title=10 Truly Stellar Episodes |url= |magazine= [[TV Guide]] |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website "[[Den of Geek]]" in January 2013. He was surprised by the episode as he "went in expecting something that was typically season one awful, and got something that was actually a lot of fun".&lt;ref name=denofgeekreview&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunt|first=James|title=Revisiting Star Trek TNG: 11001001|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek-the-next-generation/24054/revisiting-star-trek-tng-11001001|accessdate=March 4, 2013|newspaper=''Den of Geek''|date=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He thought that the theme of symbiosis between man and machine was "interesting", stating it was the best episode up until that point in season one and one of the best of the season overall.&lt;ref name=denofgeekreview/&gt; Zack Handlen watched the episode for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' in May 2010. He too was surprised by what he found. Handlen said that "last time I saw it, I thought Riker and Minuet's interactions were cheesy as hell. They didn't bother me so much now, because they don't go on very long, and there's something hilarious about a man trying to seduce a computer simulation designed to respond to his seductions".&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite news|last=Handlen|first=Zack|title="11001001"/"Too Short A Season"/"When The Bough Breaks"|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/11001001too-short-a-seasonwhen-the-bough-breaks,40903/|accessdate=March 4, 2013|newspaper=The A.V. Club|date=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he said, "I had fun with this, which I wasn't expecting",&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; and "thought this was solid".&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; He gave the episode a B grade.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt;

[[Keith DeCandido]] reviewed the episode for [[Tor Books|Tor.com]] in June 2011. He described it as "one of the strongest first-season episodes",&lt;ref name=decandido&gt;{{cite web|last=DeCandido|first=Keith|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Rewatch: "11001001"|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/06/star-trek-the-next-generation-rewatch-q11001001q|publisher=Tor.com|date=June 23, 2011|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bynars as "one of the finest alien species ''Trek'' has provided".&lt;ref name=decandido/&gt; He also thought that turning off the auto-destruct with two minutes to go instead of mere seconds neatly avoided a cliché, and gave it a score of seven out of ten.&lt;ref name=decandido/&gt; Michelle Erica Green for [[TrekNation]] watched the episode in June 2007. She thought that it came "very close to being a really good episode".&lt;ref name=greenreview&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Michelle Erica|title=11001001|url=http://www.trektoday.com/reviews/tng/11001001.shtml|publisher=TrekNation|date=June 8, 2007|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also thought that Picard and Riker's actions were the "most boneheaded joint behavior by the top two officers", in that they got distracted by a female character on the holodeck and didn't notice the ship being evacuated.&lt;ref name=greenreview/&gt; Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website "Jammer's Reviews" described "11001001" as "easily season one's best and most memorable episode".&lt;ref name=jammer&gt;{{cite web|last=Epsicokhan|first=Jamahl|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation "11001001"|url=http://www.jammersreviews.com/st-tng/s1/11001001.php|publisher=Jammer's Reviews|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that it was the "season's most solid sci-fi concept" and that the series was "firing on all cylinders, with everything coming together, from plot to character, to sensible use of technology and action".&lt;ref name=jammer/&gt; He gave it a score of four out of four.&lt;ref name=jammer/&gt;

==Home media release==
The first home media release of "11001001" was on [[VHS]] cassette, appearing on August 26, 1992, in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 16: 11001001 [VHS]|url=http://www.tower.com/star-trek-next-generation-episode-16-11001001-patrick-stewart-vhs/wapi/109139375|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412001213/http://www.tower.com/star-trek-next-generation-episode-16-11001001-patrick-stewart-vhs/wapi/109139375|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 12, 2013|publisher=Tower Video|accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was later included on the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' season one [[DVD]] box set, released in March 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Periguard|first=Mark A|title='Life as a House' rests on shaky foundation|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-84129654.html|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=The Boston Herald|date=March 24, 2002}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then released as part of the season one [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] set on July&amp;nbsp;24, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaffer|first=RL|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Beams to Blu-ray|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/04/30/star-trek-the-next-generation-beams-to-blu-ray|accessdate=17 October 2012|newspaper=IGN|date=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''303''''' is a six-issue [[comic-book]] [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]] created by [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Jacen Burrows]], and published by [[Avatar Press]]. The story targets a mature audience.

==Plot summary==
The story spans two parts titled "Afghanistan's Plains" and "Black Arrow" (after a [[monologue]] in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'') each consisting of three issues and centers around a [[Russia]]n [[Spetsnaz]] [[colonel]].

In the first part the colonel leads a [[Russia]]n team investigating a plane crash in [[Afghanistan]]. Violence soon erupts after first [[United Kingdom|British]] and then [[United States|American]] [[military]] forces become involved in the investigation. In the aftermath, the colonel helps a wounded British [[Special Air Service]] trooper who translates a document found on the plane. The document suggests that there is a high-level [[Cabal|conspiracy]] in the United States; that the [[War on Terrorism|Global War On Terror]] was started in order to facilitate the west taking over the [[oil]]-rich [[Middle East]].

In the second part the colonel travels alone to the United States in order to carry out a self-assigned mission, where he first faces a [[sheriff]] troubled by the loss of his wife because of the deficiency of their insurance. The story also focuses on the problems of [[Illegal immigration|illegal Mexican immigrants]] apparently exploited at a [[slaughterhouse]] called "McHell". The Colonel eventually assassinates the [[President of the United States]] with the intention of stopping the Global War on Terror, using a [[Lee–Enfield]] rifle using only iron sights, firing from behind a closed window.

==Name==
The title of the series refers to a [[.303 British]] [[caliber|calibre]] [[Lee–Enfield]] [[rifle]].

==Collected editions==
The issues have been collected as a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]:
* ''303'' (by [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Jacen Burrows]], [[Avatar Press]], 6-issue mini-series, [[2004 in comics|2004]], [[Trade paperback (comics)|tpb]], 144 pages, March [[2007 in comics|2007]], {{ISBN|1-59291-037-8}})

[[File:ag bear.jpg|right|thumb|AG Bear|alt=A picture of AG Bear]]

'''AG Bear''' or '''Almost Grown Bear''' is a talking [[teddy bear]] that responds to human voice. He was designed by Ron Milner, and manufactured by Axlon, a company formed by [[Nolan Bushnell]], founder of [[Atari]] and [[Chuck E. Cheese]], through his [[Catalyst Technologies]] [[Venture Capital Firm|venture capital firm]]. The manufacturer's tag on AG—which stands for "Almost Grown"--lists the bear's production date as 1985.

==Description==
The bear was a commercial success due to its interactive capabilities: AG Bear is equipped with a voice box which was originally intended to mimic the [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] of the human voice or other sounds in the environment, but expectations changed when children discovered that AG could respond with a spontaneous voice. AG Bear's voice is [[synth]] with some "growling". The company referred to this as "bear talk". When two AG bears are placed beside each other, they interact once one of them starts talking (sound is what makes AG bear react, so the sound of one AG Bear would set the other one talking, and so on). 

AG Bear was released in several different fur colors: the traditional bear is brown, while other bear colors include white and grey. AG's traditional clothing is a blue corduroy shirt with a gold AG Bear monogram, although a red corduroy version also exists.  Several other versions of the bear were released over time, including GrandPaw AG, GrandMaw AG, Bearonica (AG's sister), and several Baby AG's.

When Axlon was eventually sold to [[Hasbro]], AG Bear production was halted.  But in the late 1990s, a multi-year lobbying effort resulted in an agreement to resume production of the original AG in a [[Limited-run manufacturing|limited run edition]].{{Cn|date=October 2017}}

{{nihongo|'''''Adventures of Lolo 2'''''|アドベンチャーズ オブ ロロ|Adobenchāzu obu Roro}} is a [[computer puzzle game|puzzle game]] released in 1990 by [[HAL Laboratory|HAL Corporation]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES/Family Computer]]. It is the sixth installment of the Japanese [[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]] video game series; it was the fourth game released in European countries and the second one released in the [[United States]] and Canada.&lt;ref name="freewebs.com"&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/eggerland/theeggerlandseries.htm www.freewebs.com: The Eggerland Series] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000139/http://www.freewebs.com/eggerland/theeggerlandseries.htm |date=October 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Big Book of Nintendo Games"/&gt;
The previous title in the series was titled [[Adventures of Lolo]], too, but it was released in North America and Europe only. Therefore, this title was localized as ''Adventures of Lolo 2'' outside Japan.

''Adventures of Lolo 2'' was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on June 5, 2007, in North America on January 21, 2008,&lt;ref name="nintendolife.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2008/01/adventures_of_lolo_2_virtual_console |title=Review: Adventures of Lolo 2 |author=Marcel van Duyn |date=22 January 2008 |publisher=nintendolife.com |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[PAL regions]] on February 1, 2008.

==Gameplay==
[[File:AdventuresofLolo2Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]

Gameplay is virtually identical to the previous [[Adventures of Lolo|Adventures of Lolo 1]] and [[Eggerland: Sōzō e no Tabidachi]]. Some of the monster graphics were drawn differently, mainly Gol, Rocky, Skull, Medusa, and Don Medusa. Other differences include new puzzles and greater difficulty, with some puzzles taken from the older games in the [[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland series]].

The game features a total of 50 different puzzle rooms; the player faces King Egger at the end. Also featured are four hidden Pro puzzle rooms, which are available for players who want to try very challenging rooms.&lt;ref name = "Big Book of Nintendo Games"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Steven |title=Big Book of Nintendo Games |publisher= Compute Books |date=1991 |pages=19–20  |isbn=0874552486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "nintendolife.com"/&gt;

The Japanese version has mostly different and more difficult levels compared to the North American and European release.

'''''Air''''' is a Japanese [[Eroge|adult]] [[visual novel]] developed by [[Key (company)|Key]] released on September 8, 2000 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[Personal computers|PCs]]. Key later released versions of ''Air'' without the erotic content, and the game was [[Porting|ported]] to the [[Dreamcast]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation Vita]]. The story follows the life of Yukito Kunisaki, a traveling [[showman]] searching for the "girl in the sky". He arrives in a quiet, seaside town where he meets three girls, one of whom is the key to the end of his journey.

The [[gameplay]] in ''Air'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the three female main characters by the [[player character]]. The game is divided into three segments—Dream, Summer, and Air—which serve as different phases in the overall story. The title of the game reflects the prominent themes of the air, skies, and use of wings throughout gameplay. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. ''Air'' has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms.

Following the game's release, ''Air'' made several transitions into other media. A [[manga]] by [[Yukimaru Katsura]] was serialized in [[Kadokawa Shoten]]'s ''[[Comptiq]]'', and later published into two volumes. [[Comic anthology|Comic anthologies]] and [[art book]]s were also published, as were [[audio drama]]s and several albums of music. [[Kyoto Animation]] produced a 13-episode [[anime]] television series and a two-episode anime mini-series in 2005, and [[Toei Animation]] produced an anime film in 2005. The anime adaptations are licensed by [[Funimation]] who released them in North America.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Misuzu original Air game.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Typical dialogue and narrative in ''Air'' depicting the main character Yukito talking to Misuzu.]]
''Air'' is a [[Romance (love)|romance]] [[visual novel]] in which the player assumes the role of three characters.&lt;ref name="visual-book"&gt;{{Cite book|publication-date=April 2001|title=Air art works|publisher=[[Paradigm (publisher)|Paradigm]]|page=224|isbn=978-4-89490-318-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its [[gameplay]] is spent on reading the story's [[narrative]] and [[dialogue]]. ''Air'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, there would be an option to rewind the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.

There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, three which are initially available and two more which can later become available.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction.

When first playing the game, the player assumes the role of Yukito Kunisaki and the scenarios for the three heroines are available in what is called the Dream [[story arc]]. After the plot lines for these three heroines have been completed, an additional scenario called Summer is made available where the player assumes the role of Ryūya. Summer is a linear novel arc in which no choices are presented to the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://brightbell.main.jp/kipima/game/Air/Summer.html|title=Summer arc playthrough chart|accessdate=May 16, 2008|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the completion of the Summer route, another scenario called Air is made available, which serves as the true ending to the story. In Air, the player assumes the role of a [[Jungle Crow|crow]] named Sora.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; In the [[Hentai|adult]] versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual [[Computer graphics|CGs]] depicting Yukito and a given heroine having sex.&lt;ref name="Key-Air-official" /&gt; Later, Key released versions of ''Air'' without the erotic content.&lt;ref name="Key-Air-official" /&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Air town.png|thumb|200px|left|''Air'' takes place in a town modeled on Kami, Japan.]]
===Setting and themes===
There are important locations featured in ''Air'' that are based on places in the city [[Kami, Hyōgo (Mikata)|Kami]] in [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], Japan.&lt;ref name="hentai.co.uk" /&gt; ''Air'' is set in the [[Kasumi, Hyogo|Kasumi]] district of Kami; during the course of the series' creation, Kasumi was an individual town that has since merged with two others to form the city of Kami. Many of the locales in ''Air'', such as the [[seawall]], the [[train station]], the [[Jinja (Shinto)|shrine]], and the school are based on real places.&lt;ref name="hentai.co.uk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302103022/http://htc.moon.st/ota/05041601.html|url=http://htc.moon.st/ota/05041601.html|archivedate=March 2, 2007|title=Air's setting based on real locations|publisher=htc.moon.st|accessdate=June 8, 2009|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Air'' is set in the middle of summer, the season offers bright, sunny skies for the town during the day.&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' その先には閉ざすものなく、空が広がっていた。遮へい物のひとつもない。陽光が揺らいだ。&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "In front of me is an unchecked, wide open sky. No obscuring objects whatsoever. The sunlight oscillated down." &lt;br /&gt;{{cite video game| title = Air| developer = [[Key (company)|Key]]| publisher = [[VisualArt's]]| date=September 8, 2000| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the manga adaptation, the town is described as a "quiet town with few people...with nothing but beaches and countryside."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katsura|first=Yukimaru|title=Air manga volume 1|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|year= 2004|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenario assistant [[Yūichi Suzumoto]] has commented that his impression of ''Air'' is similar to that of a [[folk song]] due to the rural setting and heartwarming story progression.&lt;ref name="Air-interview" /&gt;

As indicated by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the "girl in the sky",&lt;ref name="hentai.co.uk" /&gt; and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi who is a member of the [[astronomy]] club,&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' …部活動というものがあるのです…天文部です&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." &lt;br /&gt;{{cite video game| title = Air| developer = [[Key (company)|Key]]| publisher = [[VisualArt's]]| date=September 8, 2000| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Michiru who has a fondness for [[Soap bubble|bubbles]] that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds {{Nihongo|''Sora''|空|}}—Japanese for "sky". Another major theme is the [[maternal bond]], as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer [[Jun Maeda]] commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with ''Air'', though he backs this up by noting that in [[bishōjo game]]s, women are the main focus anyway.&lt;ref name="Air-interview" /&gt; Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story.&lt;ref name="Air-interview" /&gt; One of the sub-themes in the story is [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 魔法が使えたらって、思ったことないかなぁ？&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "If you could use sorcery, what do you think would happen?" &lt;br /&gt;{{cite video game| title = Air| developer = [[Key (company)|Key]]| publisher = [[VisualArt's]]| date=September 8, 2000| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uraha, Yukito's mother,&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 俺が母親から伝えられた、手を触れずに人形を操る力。&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "I had inherited the ability to control puppets without touching them from my mother." &lt;br /&gt;{{cite video game| title = Air| developer = [[Key (company)|Key]]| publisher = [[VisualArt's]]| date=September 8, 2000| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yukito himself&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 手を触れることなく、人形を動かす力。俺にとっては当たり前の力。この少女にわかる言葉で、それを説明するなら…「…一種の魔法だ」&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' A power that can move a puppet without touching it. To me, it's a power that's nothing out of the ordinary. But if I had to explain it to this girl using terminology she knew... "...it's a kind of magic." &lt;br /&gt;{{cite video game| title = Air| developer = [[Key (company)|Key]]| publisher = [[VisualArt's]]| date=September 8, 2000| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; have the ability to use magic, though Yukito is the least skilled among them. Kano was told by her sister that when she grows up and takes off her yellow ribbon, she will gain the power to do magic. However, the problems of parents leaving their offspring and poverty are displayed realistically.

The player assumes the role of Yukito Kunisaki, the protagonist of ''Air''. He lives a poor life going from town to town with little money, trying to make a living off his show with a puppet. By being an adolescent or young adult, Yukito sometimes acts childishly if provoked. Yukito tends to be helpful to those around him while trying to earn any money at the same time, and does his best to look after Misuzu in the Dream arc. Misuzu Kamio, the main heroine of ''Air'', makes Yukito quite mistrustful at first by being too friendly, but eventually earns his affection. She is a cheerful but introverted, slightly clumsy and simplistic high school girl, and often utters the pseudo-dinosauric phrase ''gao'' when she feels troubled, a habit she retained from childhood. Misuzu has a great love of [[dinosaur]]s, finding the story of their glory and extinction "romantic". As a child, her fascination with dinosaurs stemmed from thinking chicks would grow into them; her adoptive mother Haruko Kamio thinks it is ridiculous.

The second of the three heroines Yukito meets after Misuzu is Kano Kirishima, a girl attending the same school as Misuzu. She is usually energetic, playful, and tells jokes by saying nonsensical things. Kano is friends with a strange stray dog named Potato that follows her around and is able to communicate in his strange manner of speech.&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 見事にコミュニケーションがなされている。&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "She surprisingly seems to be able to communicate with it." &lt;br /&gt;{{cite video game| title = Air| developer = [[Key (company)|Key]]| publisher = [[VisualArt's]]| date=September 8, 2000| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kano still believes in things she was told by her older sister Hijiri as a child as a way of coping with her past. The third and final heroine Yukito meets is a girl in Misuzu's class at school named Minagi Tohno, a top student in the school who is introverted as well. Until she met Yukito, her only friend was Michiru, with whom she often blows bubbles at the abandoned train station in town.

===Story===
''Air''{{'s}} story revolves around three girls whose lives are connected to the same man. In the first [[story arc]], Dream, Yukito Kunisaki is a [[showman]] traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the "girl in the sky".&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' …この空の向こうには、翼を持った少女がいる。…それは、ずっと昔から。…そして、今、この時も。それは俺が幼い頃、母に聞かされた言葉だった。詳しいことを教えるより先に、母は死んでしまった。それ以来、俺は一人で旅を続けてきた。空にいる少女の話。&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "...at the far end of the sky, there is a girl who has wings...from the distant past...even now, she is still there. That is what I heard from my mother when I was small. Before I could ask more clearly, my mother died. After that, I continued journeying alone. The myth of the girl in the sky." &lt;br /&gt;{{cite video game| title = Air| developer = [[Key (company)|Key]]| publisher = [[VisualArt's]]| date=September 8, 2000| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's [[seawall]] by the beach. Yukito collapses from [[heat stroke]] the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. As he sits on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' …わかった。泊めたる。納屋にな。&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "...I understand. Stay here. Sleep in the garage."&lt;br /&gt;{{cite video game| title = Air| developer = [[Key (company)|Key]]| publisher = [[VisualArt's]]| date=September 8, 2000| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Yukito meets a girl named Kano Kirishima and a stray dog named Potato; Kano and Misuzu go to the same high school. Later that day, Yukito meets a third girl named Minagi Tohno, Misuzu's classmate, and her friend Michiru. Like Misuzu, both Kano and Minagi have strange personalities connected with mysterious pasts. Before long, a legend of "one thousand summers" begins to unfold where the mysteries of the past are framed primarily by the relationship between Yukito and Misuzu. The cursed "girl in the sky" Yukito has been searching for turns out to be Misuzu. By the time he figures this out, she has already grown to love him and has passed her 15th birthday. Once these things have come to pass, the "girl in the sky" is cursed to die. The remainder of this arc is dedicated to Yukito's attempt to save her, trying to effectively break the curse.

The next arc, Summer, reveals events that occurred in the summer of one thousand years before the Dream arc, taking place in the [[Heian period]].&lt;ref&gt;The Dream and Air arcs in ''Air'' are set in 2000; one thousand years prior in Japan in 1000 was during the [[Heian period]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9039814|title=Heian period|encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2008|accessdate=May 16, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080511040345/http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9039814| archivedate= 11 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kannabi no mikoto, or Kanna, is one of the last winged beings in ''Air''{{'}}s fictional setting and is held as a prisoner in her own castle. Since she bears wings on her back, she is not permitted to leave the castle walls or see her mother, who is in a similar situation elsewhere. With Ryūya, a member of her [[samurai]] guard, and Uraha, a fledgling telekinetic, Kanna escapes and traverses feudal Japan to find her mother. However, the rest of the guard and a sect of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[monk]]s follow them. After catching up, they place a curse on Kanna where she must endure constant reincarnation and death whenever she finds love; Misuzu is one such reincarnation.

In the last arc, Air, Yukito's final wish to save Misuzu's life is heard. The timeline of the Dream arc has been reset, although it is now seen through the viewpoint of a crow Misuzu finds and names Sora. New things are revealed that were not seen following Yukito in the Dream arc. After Misuzu finds Sora and brings him back home, her condition worsens and eventually she forgets even who Haruko is. Misuzu's father, Keisuke Tachibana, shows up during this arc wanting to take Misuzu back to his home, but Haruko pleads with him to grant her more time, and they agree on extending the time for three more days. After the three days pass, Keisuke comes back and sees the love between Misuzu and Haruko; he decides to let them stay together. The remainder of this arc has Misuzu and Haruko spending time together like mother and daughter, culminating in Misuzu's death.

==Development==
After the completion of ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'', the Key staff started production on ''Air'' and expanded the number of people involved in this project compared to ''Kanon''. The [[executive producer]] for ''Air'' was Takahiro Baba from [[VisualArt's]], the publishing company that Key is under. The planning for ''Air'' was headed by [[Jun Maeda]] who was also one of two main scenario writers, the other being Takashi Ishikawa.&lt;ref name="staff2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=84|title=''Air'' staff information|publisher=Erogamescape|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001020927/http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=84|archivedate=October 1, 2007| accessdate=December 19, 2014|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenario assistance was provided by four more people: Kazuki Fujii, Kai, Tōya Okano, and [[Yūichi Suzumoto]]. Art direction was headed by Key's artist [[Itaru Hinoue]] who worked on the character design. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Miracle Mikipon, [[Na-Ga]], and Shinory—and background art was provided by Din and Torino. The music in the game was [[composer|composed]] primarily by [[Shinji Orito]], Jun Maeda, and [[Magome Togoshi]],&lt;ref name="staff2" /&gt; who had started working with Key since before ''Kanon''{{'}}s release. After the completion of ''Air'', two of the staff—Kazuki Fujii, and Takashi Ishikawa—left Key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=3454 |title=''Clannad'' staff information |publisher=Erogamescape |accessdate=June 8, 2007 |language=Japanese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513014844/http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=3454 |archivedate=13 May 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jun Maeda]], the main scenario writer of ''Air'', commented that in the early stages of ''Air''{{'s}} production, it was already decided that it was to be an [[Eroge|adult game]], and he further assumes that if it was not at least first released with adult content, that it would not have been as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write ''Air'' to give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical [[bishōjo game]]s do, including ''Kanon''. While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as ''Air'' to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.&lt;ref name="Air-interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akirunoneko.at.infoseek.co.jp/archive/text/AIR_interview.htm |title=Key Scenario Staff Long Interview |publisher=Colorful Pure Girl |date=March 2001 |accessdate=May 16, 2008 |language=Japanese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605054025/http://akirunoneko.at.infoseek.co.jp/archive/text/AIR_interview.htm |archivedate=5 June 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
===Manga===
An ''Air'' [[manga]] was serialized in the Japanese [[computer game]] magazine ''[[Comptiq]]'' between August 10, 2004 and February 10, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comptiq.com/release/comptiq/2004_09.html |title=''Comptiq'' September 2004 issue |publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]] |accessdate=June 25, 2006 |language=Japanese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630101532/http://www.comptiq.com/release/comptiq/2004_09.html |archivedate=June 30, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual chapters were later collected into two separate [[Tankōbon|volumes]] published by [[Kadokawa Shoten]]. The story was adapted from the visual novel version that preceded it, and was illustrated by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Mangaka|artist]] [[Yukimaru Katsura]]. Between the two volumes, there are 15 main chapters (nine in volume one and six in volume two), and two [[Omake|bonus]] chapters included at the end of each volume.&lt;ref name="airmanga1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katsura|first=Yukimaru|title=Air manga volume 1|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="airmanga2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katsura|first=Yukimaru|title=Air manga volume 2|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manga version goes through the Dream and Air arcs in detail while the Summer arc is only touched upon briefly throughout the manga. The main focus is on Misuzu's story with Kano and Minagi serving as minor characters in comparison. However, Minagi's story is explained in the bonus installment at the end of volume two.&lt;ref name="airmanga2" /&gt;

There are also five sets of manga [[anthology|anthologies]] produced by different companies and drawn by a multitude of different artists. The first volume of the earliest anthology series, released by [[Ichijinsha]] under the title ''Air Comic Anthology'', was released on January 25, 2001 under their ''DNA Media Comics'' label. Volumes for this series continued to be released until December 25, 2001 with the seventh volume. The second anthology, ''Air Anthology Comic'', was released in a single volume by Softgarage on December 20, 2002. On April 17, 2004, Ohzora released an anthology composed of works based on both ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'' and ''Air'' titled ''Haru Urara: Kanon &amp; Air''. Ohzora also released three other anthologies under the title ''Air'', the last of which came out on March 24, 2005.&lt;ref name="Air3" /&gt; The last manga anthology was released as a single volume on April 2, 2005 by [[Jive (publisher)|Jive]] titled ''Comic Anthology Air: Kimi no Iru Basho''.

{{see also|List of Air episodes}}
On November 17, 2004, a teaser [[DVD]] named "Air prelude" was produced containing interviews with the anime's cast, clean opening and ending theme video sequences, and promotional footage of the anime itself; it was a limited edition DVD, with only 20,000 copies produced. The [[anime]] television series is produced by [[Kyoto Animation]], directed by [[Tatsuya Ishihara]], written by [[Fumihiko Shimo]], and features character design by Tomoe Aratani who based the designs on [[Itaru Hinoue]]'s original concept. Thirteen episodes were produced by Kyoto Animation: 12 regular episodes, and a final [[Abridgement|recap]] episode which summarizes Misuzu's [[story arc]]. The anime also follows the game by splitting the series into three parts; Dream (episodes one through seven), Summer (episodes eight and nine), and Air (episodes 10 through 12), with the recap episode (episode 13) following. The episodes aired between January 6 and March 31, 2005 on the [[BS-i]] Japanese [[television network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/air/story/story.html|title=Official website listing of all TV episodes|publisher=[[BS-i]]| accessdate=April 27, 2007|language=Japanese| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070414154129/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/air/story/story.html| archivedate= 14 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme songs from the ''Air'' visual novel are used for the anime's opening theme, ending theme and soundtrack.

The visual novel has three main theme songs: the opening theme {{Nihongo|"[[Tori no Uta]]"|鳥の詩|Bird's Poem}}, the ending theme "Farewell song", and {{Nihongo|"Aozora"|青空|Blue Skies}} as an insert song.

'''''Armored Core 2: Another Age''''' is a [[mecha]] [[third-person shooter]] video game in the ''[[Armored Core]]'' series, developed by [[FromSoftware]], which also published it in Japan, for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001. [[Agetec]] and [[Metro 3D]] released the game in North America and Europe respectively.

==Storyline==
Five years after [[Armored Core 2|the coup attempt led by Leos Klein]] the Earth government struggles to realize one of its original objectives, relocating people from the underground cities to the Earth's surface. These plans are hopelessly delayed because the government has had to shift its focus from resettlement to military buildup. A necessary move in the government's eyes, needed to keep both the corporations and the situation on Mars in check. After facing various setbacks, the corporations that once held sway on Mars are in positions of diminished influence. This does not sit well with them and each is secretly rebuilding their personal armies in order to contend with the government's growing might. Tensions between the corporations and government are at a breaking point. With all of the government's efforts currently focused elsewhere, resentment toward the institution from the general populace is at an all-time high. Tired of being neglected, people living in the underground cities have taken matters into their own hands and incidents of armed revolt are a daily occurrence.

==Background==

===Corporations===
*'''Zio Matrix''' - Following a failed coup attempt (through which Zio hoped to strengthen its power base by exploiting Disorder technology), the parent company sidestepped most repercussions by discreetly transferring blame to its Mars division, claiming it acted alone. Even so, Zio Matrix now toes a fine line with the government and is more circumspect in its dealings.
*'''Emeraude''' - After an all-out clash with the LCC on Mars, Emeraude's position has been significantly weakened. In a bid to combat the government's increasing influence and regain lost ground, Emeraude actively pursues confrontation and is the most volatile corporate element.
*'''Balena''' - Due to the Frighteners overstepping their authority, Balena and the LCC's efforts to reshuffle the power structure on Mars failed. Balena's ties with both Zio and Emeraude are all but severed, now that the company's involvement with the government is public knowledge. Balena continues to provide assistance to the government, but it is also secretly backing the Indies rebel group.

===Government===
*'''The Earth Government''' - Under the [[tagline]] "The Central Union of [[Earth]]", the Earth government is exactly what its name suggests it is; a singular governmental body serving the entire planet.  After [[Armored Core: Master of Arena|the end of the subterranean era]] and the downfall of the [[Armored Core (video game)#Corporations|Earth-based corporations]] the government rebuilt itself into the ruling body it was prior to the "Great Destruction".  The government relies primarily on proxies like the Bureaus of Control and the LCC to govern locally while it focuses on the environmental reclamation and the repopulation of Earth's surface.  After being [[Armored Core 2|betrayed by the Frighteners]], the government has become reluctant to employ Ravens unless circumstances are dire and Ravens are not allowed to enter Earth Central, the capital city of Earth.
**'''Bureaus of Control (BOC)''' - Administrative bodies set in place by the government. BOC's exist in all major Earth cities and are tasked with supervising development, regulating corporate activity, and maintaining order in their respective cities and the surrounding areas. Bureau names indicate their area of jurisdiction, for example, Neo Isaac Bureau of Control.

===Independent Groups===
*'''Indies''' - A large, well-financed rebel group that plots against both the government and corporations in a bid to overthrow them and establish a new governing body. Its ranks consist mainly of the poor and disenfranchised, but a number of Ravens have taken up the cause as well.
*'''Nerves Concord''' - The Nerves Concord continues its role as both Arena operator and impartial middleman between the corporations and Ravens. Though siding with no one, the Nerves Concord's function perpetuates corporate rivalries.

==Gameplay==
The expansion to ''[[Armored Core 2]]'' runs on the same game engine as its predecessor but features a number of changes in the way the game is played. There is no trial mission in Another Age that kicks the game off, the player is simply thrown into the world with their AC and their first job offer right there waiting for them. The Arena, which played a significant role in ''Armored Core 2'' has been removed completely, along with the "Arena Report" in your save data, but a fair number of the game's missions involve one-on-one combat with other Ravens in a set-up not unlike ''Armored Core 2'''s Arena. Another Age has sparse expressed plot, it is more a portrait of the life of a mercenary, always bouncing about from place to place and not getting tied down to any one particular cause. Occasionally recurring elements pop up from time to time as the game progresses, but there is no defined storyline to the game. While there is virtually no storyline there are 100 separate missions that make up the mass of the game, the largest ''Armored Core'' title to date, and each mission plays out in a specific area of the world map screen that would reappear in following AC titles down the road. Another Age is also noted for its cameo appearances. Past enemies from previous ''Armored Core'' games Stinger and Nineball appear as bosses in several special missions that are unlocked once you clear all 100 of the game's missions.

Also of note is that for the first time in the Armored Core series, analog controls are supported. While Armored Core 2 did use the analog stick buttons (L3 and R3) on the [[DualShock 2]], player control was still based on the D-pad and whatever other buttons were mapped to view/motion control. However, this is limited to using the left analog stick for forward/backward movement and turning similarly to the D-pad.

The '''Association of Performing Arts Professionals''' (previously the Association of Performing Arts Presenters, also known as '''APAP'''), based in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.apap365.org/About/Pages/default.aspx "About" page], apap365.org, official site of APAP. Accessed online 2013-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[United States]] national service, advocacy and membership organization for the [[performing arts]] presenting sector and the convener of APAP|NYC, the world’s leading gathering of performing arts professionals, every January in [[New York City]].  

Founded in 1957, APAP is a [[501(c)(3) organization]] governed by a volunteer board of directors and led by President and CEO Mario Garcia Durham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apap365.org/ABOUT/staff/Pages/MarioGarciaDurham.aspx|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

APAP's story begins in the 1950s when college and university concert managers directed their interests toward the educational role of the arts and the unique issues related to professional performing arts on campus. Fan Taylor, presenter at the [[Wisconsin Union Theater]], became the founder of APAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apap365.org/ABOUT/WhoWeAre/Pages/fan-taylor.aspx|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The University of Wisconsin]] in Madison initially housed the staff. During the 1960s and 1970s, the presenting field and membership expanded to a variety of organizations, prompting the association to change its name to the Association of College, University and Community Arts Administrators (ACUCAA) in 1973. By the mid-1980s, colleges and universities no longer dominated the membership, and the association’s spectrum expanded. The organization’s name was changed to the Association of Performing Arts Presenters in 1988. Fan Taylor led the organization for 24 years. Bill Dawson succeeded Taylor in 1971 and served until 1986, when Susie Farr became the third executive director until her departure in 1999. During her tenure the national office relocated to [[Washington,_D.C.|Washington, D.C.]] Sandra Gibson served as president and CEO from 2000 until 2011. In October 2011, the board of directors appointed Mario Garcia Durham as president and CEO, the fifth leader of APAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APAP's History|url=http://www.apap365.org/ABOUT/WhoWeAre/Pages/history.aspx|website=apap365.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Atlantis Sky Patrol''''' is a [[casual game]] developed by the team formerly known as [[Funpause]], now part of [[Big Fish Studios]], and distributed by [[Big Fish Games]]. The game is a sequel to 2005's ''Atlantis''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Plot ==
In an alternative, [[retro-futuristic]] in the early 20th century, the player takes the role of the leader of the Sky Patrol, a secretive air patrol that takes on world threats. As the game begins, strange [[doomsday device]]s have been reportedly seen all across the world. Believed to originate from the long-lost continent of Atlantis, possibly as retaliation from looting its treasure in the first game, the player must disable all of them to save the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">In [[mathematical logic]], '''projective determinacy''' is the special case of the [[axiom of determinacy]] applying only to [[projective set]]s.

The '''axiom of projective determinacy''', abbreviated '''PD''', states that for any two-player infinite game of [[perfect information]] of length [[Ω (ordinal number)|ω]] in which the players play [[natural number]]s, if the victory set (for either player, since the projective sets are closed under complementation) is projective, then one player or the other has a [[winning strategy]].

The axiom is not a theorem of [[ZFC]] (assuming ZFC is consistent), but unlike the full axiom of determinacy (AD), which contradicts the [[axiom of choice]], it is not known to be inconsistent with ZFC. PD follows from certain [[large cardinal]] axioms, such as the existence of infinitely many [[Woodin cardinal]]s.

PD implies that all projective sets are [[Lebesgue measurable]] (in fact, [[universally measurable]]) and have the [[perfect set property]] and the [[property of Baire]].  It also implies that every projective [[binary relation]] may be [[Uniformization (set theory)|uniformized]] by a projective set.

'''''Babakiueria''''' (also known under the video-title '''''Babakiueria (Barbeque Area)''''') is a 1986 [[Australian]] [[satire|satirical]] film on relations between [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal Australians]] and [[European Australian|Australians of European descent]].

==Synopsis==
''Babakiueria'' revolves around a role-reversal, whereby it is Aboriginal Australians who have invaded and [[colonization|colonised]] the fictitious country of Babakiueria, a land that has long been inhabited by white natives, the Babakiuerians.

The opening scene depicts a group of Aboriginal Australians in military uniforms coming ashore in a land they have not previously been to. In this land, they discover a number of European Australians engaged in stereotypical European Australian activities. The Aboriginal Australian explorers approach the group and the expedition's leader asks them, "What do you call this place"? One of the Europeans replies, "Er... '[[Barbecue]] Area'".

After around 200 years of Aboriginal occupation, white Australians have become a minority. Aboriginal people have assumed power, taken all of the available land and have mostly confined whites to suburban [[ghettos]]. They are expected to follow the laws and customs of the colonisers and their lifestyle is seen through the patronizing eyes of the majority culture. The latest [[wikt:manifest|manifestation]] of this is in a 'documentary' presented by Duranga Manika ([[Michelle Torres (actor)|Michelle Torres]]).&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abccommercial.com/librarysales/program/babakiueria |title="Babakiueria" |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ra"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radio.adelaide.edu.au/babakiueria-a-satirical-tale-of-the-invasion-of-the-white-peoples-land/ |title=""BabaKiueria" – a satirical tale of the invasion of the white people’s land" |publisher=[[Radio Adelaide]] |date=26 January 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UMD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/troufs/anth1604/video/Babakiueria.html |last=Roufs |first=Timothy |title="Babakiueria" |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Duluth]] |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the film follows Duranga Manika as she observes how white people are disempowered through poverty, are treated unfairly by the police - often with [[Police brutality|brutality]] and indifference, experience arbitrary dispossession, government inaction on white issues, white [[tokenism]], [[Stolen Generation|white children being taken from their families]] only to be taught the values of the majority culture and white people being relocated because the government needs their home for "something". White people are now often characterized by society and in the media as lazy, unintelligent and untrustworthy and anyone who protests about the current circumstances is labeled as a 'troublemaker'. White rituals and cultural values are derided and dismissed as violent and meaningless. The Babakiuerian government's [[paternalistic]] policies are defended by Wagwan, the Minister for White Affairs ([[Bob Maza]]) who was based on the then [[Premier of Queensland]], [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen|Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen]].&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ra" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UMD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NFSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/shorts/babakiueria/notes/ |last=Matthews |first=Kate |title="Babakiueria (1986)" |publisher=[[National Film and Sound Archive]] |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.edu.au/education/files/5313/8724/1953/Julius_Caesar.pdf |title="Cambridge Checkpoints HSC Advanced English" |publisher=[[Cambridge University]] |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inversion of reality in ''Babakiueria'' highlights the unfairness of Australia's past and present Aboriginal policies and the entrenched racism in society. This subversion of normality allows viewers to see what is wrong when one group tries to control and dominate another and questions the fairness of the current power structure in Australia.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt;

==Production==
Much of ''Babakiueria'' was filmed on location, including the Anzac March and the 'Ritual of Violence' ([[Australian Football League|AFL]] Game). It was screened in the [[Australian Museum]] for many years.&lt;ref name="NFSA" /&gt;

==Impact and Reception==
''Babakiueria'' has been used at times to educate police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativespirits.info/resources/movies/babakiueria-barbecue-area |title="Babakiueria ("Barbecue Area")" |publisher=www.CreativeSpirits.info |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After it was screened at the Message Sticks Festival in 2012, Mahjid Heath noted that "issues we were struggling with in the early 80's are still relevant and still define the political and national discourses today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/indigenous/stories/s3471253.htm |last=Heath |first=Mahjid |title="Message Sticks Festival 2012" |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2013}}
"'''Big Rock Candy Mountain'''", first recorded by [[Harry McClintock]] in 1928, is a [[American folk music|folk]] song about a [[hobo]]'s idea of [[paradise]], a modern version of the [[medieval]] concept of [[Cockaigne]].  It is a place where "hens lay [[Soft-boiled egg|soft boiled eggs]]" and there are "[[cigarette]] trees."  McClintock claimed to have written the song in 1895, based on tales from his youth hoboing through the [[United States]], but some believe that at least aspects of the song have existed for far longer. It is catalogued as [[Roud Folk Song Index]] No. 6696.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vwml.org/search?qtext=6696 |website=Vaughan Williams Memorial Library |title=Roud Folksong Index No. 6696 |accessdate=September 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The song was first recorded by McClintock, also known by his "hobo" name of Haywire Mac.  McClintock claimed credit for writing the song, though it was likely partially based on other ballads, including "[[An Invitation to Lubberland]]" and "The Appleknocker's Lament".  Other popular itinerant songs of the day such as "Hobo's Paradise", "Hobo Heaven", "Sweet Potato Mountains" and "Little Streams of Whiskey" likely served as inspiration, as they mention concepts similar to those in "Big Rock Candy Mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nowhere in America: the Big Rock Candy Mountain and Other Comic Utopias |last=Rammel |first=Hal |year= 1990|publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UD26WT4XVUsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22big+rock+candy+mountain%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before recording the song, McClintock cleaned it up considerably from the version he sang as a street [[busking|busker]] in the 1890s. Originally the song described a child being recruited into hobo life by tales of the "big rock candy mountain". In later years, when McClintock appeared in court as part of a copyright dispute, he cited the original words of the song, the last stanza of which was:

:''The punk rolled up his big blue eyes''
:''And said to the jocker, "Sandy,''
:''I've hiked and hiked and wandered too,''
:''But I ain't seen any candy.''
:''I've hiked and hiked till my feet are sore''
:''And I'll be damned if I hike any more''
:''To be buggered sore like a hobo's whore''
:''In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.''"

In the released version this verse did not appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Harry Partch, Hobo Composer |last=Granade |first=S Andrew |year= 2014|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |isbn= |page= |pages=205 |url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=ktEwBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22big+rock+candy+mountain%22+sore+buggered&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0soqvs7rNAhXBPRoKHcqaAuoQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22big%20rock%20candy%20mountain%22%20sore%20whore&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was not popularized until 1939, when it peaked at #1 on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine's]] country music charts.  But it achieved more widespread popularity in 1949 when a sanitized version intended for children was re-recorded by [[Burl Ives]].  It has been recorded by many artists throughout the world, but a version recorded in 1960 by [[Dorsey Burnette]] to date was the biggest success for the song in the post-1954 "rock era", having reached No. 102 on Billboard's chart.

Sanitized versions have been popular, especially with [[children's music]]ians; in these, the "[[cigarette]] trees" become [[peppermint]] trees, and the "streams of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]" trickling down the rocks become streams of [[lemonade]]. The lake of [[gin]] is not mentioned, and the lake of [[whiskey]] becomes a lake of [[soft drink|soda pop]]. The 2008 extended adaptation for children by Gil McLachlan tells the story as a child's dream, the last stanza being:

:''In the Big Rock Candy Mountains you're going on a holiday''
:''Your birthday comes around once a week and it’s Christmas every day''
:''You never have to clean your room or put your toys away''
:''There's a little white horse you can ride of course''
:''You can jump so high you can touch the sky''
:''In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.''

==Editions==
Folklorist [[John Greenway (folklorist)|John Greenway]] published the song in his ''American Folksongs of Protest'' (1953), redacting only the second to last line.

===Physical locations===
A cluster of brightly colored hills just north of [[Marysvale, Utah]], near the [[Fishlake National Forest]], is named the "Big Rock Candy Mountain". In 1928, after the song had been released, some Utah residents jokingly placed a sign at the base of the hills labeling it the "Big Rock Candy Mountain", along with a sign next to a nearby spring proclaiming it "Lemonade Springs".  The Big Rock Candy Mountain Resort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Rock Candy Mountain Resort|url=http://www.candymountainresort.com/|publisher=Big Rock Candy Mountain|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently sits at the base of the hills and is a major hub on the Paiute ATV trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utah.com/offroad/paiute_trail.htm |title=ATV Paiute Trail |publisher=Utah.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christine |last=Wilkerson |url=http://geology.utah.gov/surveynotes/geosights/candymtn.htm |title=Big Rock Candy Mountain - Utah Geological Survey |publisher=Geology.utah.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rock formations in the United States have also borrowed the name of the song; the largest exposed rock in the [[South Platte]] rock [[climbing area]] of [[Colorado]] is also called "Big Rock Candy Mountain" because of its colored stripes resembling a [[candy cane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/North_America/United_States/Colorado/South_Platte_Area/Big_Rock_Candy_Mountain/ |title=Rock Climbing Routes in Big Rock Candy Mountain, South Platte Area |publisher=Rockclimbing.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Hansen |url=http://www.climbingboulder.com/rock/db/south_platte/big_rock_candy_mountain/ |title=Big Rock Candy Mountain |website=Climbing Boulder.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203173539/http://www.climbingboulder.com/rock/db/south_platte/big_rock_candy_mountain/ |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one of the peaks in the [[Capitol State Forest]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State is named "Big Rock Candy Mountain".

===In literature===
*In 1943, [[Wallace Stegner]] published an autobiographical novel titled ''[[The Big Rock Candy Mountain (novel)|The Big Rock Candy Mountain]]''. He published a further autobiographical work in 1992 entitled ''Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs'', a reference to a line in the song.
*In 1945, [[George Orwell]] referenced the song in the book ''[[Animal Farm]]'' with an animal version of [[heaven]] named [[Sugarcandy Mountain]].
* In William Kennedy's 1979 novel "Ironweed," the character Rudy sings lines from the song to his fellow bums in a flophouse.
*In [[Glen Cook]]'s 1982 novel ''Shadowline'', first in the ''Starfishers'' trilogy, a planet named the Big Rock Candy Mountain is the location for several scenes.
*The song is discussed in depth in the book ''[[The Areas of My Expertise]]'' by [[John Hodgman]], and performed by [[Jonathan Coulton]] in the audiobook.
*In [[Mur Lafferty]]'s ''Heaven'' novella series, the Big Rock Candy Mountain is portrayed as the hobo afterlife.

===In film and television===
*A 1963 [[animated cartoon]], ''Hobo's Holiday'', features the adult lyrics which appear on screen with a [[bouncing ball (music)|bouncing ball]].
*In 1987, photographer [[Robert Frank]] directed a screenplay by Rudy Wurlitzer entitled ''Candy Mountain'' that references the song.
*The 2000 film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' uses this song in the opening credits.
*The theme song to the 2008-2010 TV series ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'' is a version of the song with modified lyrics, referring to "a place called Candied Island" instead of "Big Rock Candy Mountain". The series itself echoes the song, as it features two hobo-like characters searching for the legendary Candied Island.
*During the first dream sequence in the 2011 horror film ''[[Twixt (film)|Twixt]]'', the lyrics of the song are sung with an alternate melody.
*In the 2015 film ''[[Room (2015 film)|Room]]'', Ma ([[Brie Larson]]) sings a version of the song to her son Jack ([[Jacob Tremblay]]).
*In the SyFy channel series ''[[Van Helsing (TV series)|Van Helsing]]'', Sam sings bits of the song in the episode "Little Thing" and the Burl Ives rendition is played over the closing credits of several episodes.
*A version of the song by Burl Ives is played in the season 4 episode ''[[Something_Stupid_(Better_Call_Saul)|Something Stupid]]'' of [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s crime drama ''[[Better Call Saul]]''.

===In music===
* In the 1970s, "Big Rock Candy Mountain" and other songs were made into an environmental fairytale, published on an LP intended for children. It is the story of a goose, a crawdad, a family of rats, a [[whangdoodle]], and two hobos who journey to the fabled mountain in search of a home.  There they find Pollution Pete, Cement Sam, and a construction crew damming the rivers, cutting down forests, and turning the mountain into suburbia.  The animals steal shovels, paint them with glow-in-the-dark paint, and use them to scare away the crew so that the mountain can be returned to its pristine state.
*In 1987, Scottish indie pop band [[The Motorcycle Boy]] released an original song with the same title as a single.
*In 1990, [[Jane Wiedlin]] recorded an unrelated song with the same title on her album ''Tangled.''
*The song "Candy Mountain Cave", from the online video ''[[Charlie the Unicorn]]'', parodies this song (to the tune of the "[[Clarinet Polka]]").
*In 1978, country singer [[Mel Tillis]] released the single "[[Ain't No California]]", which includes the line, "Ain't no Big Rock Candy Mountain."
*In 2014, folk-punk singer Jesse Stewart makes reference in his song "''Marauder''" where he asks, "Well, where? Oh where? Is the Big Rock Candy Mountain."

'''Buster the Amazing Bear''' is a [[comic book]] series created by [[Tommy Yune]] in 1993 about a baby bear cub who is genetically altered in a laboratory accident and transforms into an [[anthropomorphic]] [[superhero]].

The style of the action and humor in the comics is initially reminiscent of [[Phil Foglio]], drifting towards an [[anime]] look over the course of the series. The final issue of the first story arc had a cliffhanger ending and some promotional artwork from the [http://busterbear.com/buster2.html second series] can be found on the web. However, with Yune working on ''[[Speed Racer]]'' and now ''[[Robotech]]'', the date of Buster's return to comics is undetermined.

'''''Citizens of Earth''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by Eden Industries and published by [[Atlus]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Wii U]], and the [[Nintendo 3DS]].

== Gameplay ==
''Citizens of Earth'' has been described as "a giant spoof on ''[[EarthBound]]''"&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/23/citizens-of-earth-review | title=Citizens of Earth Review: Grass Roots Effort | publisher=[[Ziff Davis, LLC]] | work=[[IGN]] | date=January 22, 2015 | accessdate=April 27, 2016 | author=Sullivan, Meghan}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which "you must collect your constituents like [[Pokémon]]".&lt;ref name="venture"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/01/20/citizens-of-earth-is-as-charming-and-manipulative-as-the-politics-it-mocks-review/ | title=''Citizens of Earth'' is as charming and manipulative as the politics it mocks (review) | work=[[VentureBeat]] | date=January 20, 2015 | accessdate=April 27, 2016 | author=Sullivan, Meghan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, you take the role of the newly elected Vice President of Earth, who begins his first day in office facing protestors, a missing President, and a suspicious coffee shop. As the game progresses, characters are added to the party, each with a unique title and personality, like Hippie Guy and Programmer.&lt;ref name="venture" /&gt;

Enemies are strewn about the overworld map, and should the Vice President get too close, a separate battle screen will open up. He doesn't do any fighting himself, but instead gives commands to his party of up to three characters.&lt;ref name="polygon" /&gt;

== Reception ==

}}

Meghan Sullivan of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the game a 6.5/10, saying "It charmed me with its blend of old-school RPG and contemporary satire, but nearly lost my vote with its sluggish pacing, irritatingly high enemy encounter rate, and crashes".&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3488">[[File:Cogniard brothers.jpg|thumb|The Cogniard brothers circa 1839]]
The '''Cogniard brothers''' were two French brothers who worked as playwrights and theatre directors, producing an incalculable number of [[vaudeville]]s, [[reviews]], [[féerie]]s and [[operettas]]. The elder of the two was '''Charles-Théodore''' or '''Théodore Cogniard''' (30 April 1806 - 13 May 1872) and the younger was '''Jean-Hippolyte''' or '''Hippolyte Cogniard''' (28 November 1807 – 6 February 1882)&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' (May 27, 1872)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both brothers were born and died in Paris.

Nicknamed "les jumeaux siamois du vaudeville" (the [[Siamese twins]] of vaudeville),&lt;ref&gt;Huart (1839)&lt;/ref&gt; they headed the [[théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin]] from 1840 to 1845. In 1845 Hippolyte took sole charge of the [[Théâtre du Vaudeville]], then of the [[Théâtre des Variétés]] from 1854 to 1869, where he instituted a repertoire solely consisting of operettas. It was under Hippolyte's leadership that [[Jacques Offenbach]] created his best known works   : ''[[La Belle Hélène]]'', ''[[Barbe-bleue (opera)|Barbe-Bleue]]'', ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein]]'' and ''[[La Périchole]]''. In 1869, on behalf of his son Léon, Hippolyte acquired the [[Alhambra-Maurice Chevalier|Cirque-Impérial]] and renamed it the [[Théâtre du Château d'Eau]], after its proximity to the place du Château d'Eau (now [[place de la République]]). He then took it over after his son's premature death in March 1870. (After several failures, in 1904 that theatre became one of the most famous Parisian music halls, as the Alhambra.)

As playwrights, the Cogniard brothers produced an impressive number of plays, fééries and reviews from 1830 onwards, collaborating with [[Hector Crémieux]], [[Clairville (1811-1879)|Louis-François Clairville]] and [[Paul Siraudin]]. These included ''La Cocarde tricolore'', ''La Révolte des modistes'', ''Les Deux Borgnes'', ''L'Agnès de Belleville'' (with [[Paul de Kock]]), ''Bobêche et Galimafré'', ''La Fille de l'air'', ''Les Enfants du délire'', ''Le Naufrage de la Méduse'', ''Les Mille et une nuits'', ''La Biche aux bois'', ''La Cornemuse du diable'', ''Le Royaume du calembourg'', ''La Poudre de perlimpinpin'', ''Le Monde camelotte'', ''Les Bibelots du diable'', ''La Grande Marée'', ''Sans queue ni tête'' (with Crémieux), ''La Reine Crinoline ou Le royaume des femmes'', ''Les Compagnons de la truelle'' (with Clairville), ''Les Bêtises d'hier'' (with Clairville and Siraudin) and their greatest success ''La Chatte blanche'' (a féerie put on in 1852).

'''''Divinity: Original Sin''''' is a fantasy [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Larian Studios]]. The game was partially funded through [[Kickstarter]] and is a prequel to ''[[Divine Divinity]]''. Upon its release in 2014, the game received acclaim from critics, with many praising its ability to modernize the RPG genre. The game ships with the editor that created it, allowing players to create their own [[single-player]] and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] adventures and publish them online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/larianstudios/divinity-original-sin/posts/439547|title=Hands-on with the Editor — Kickstarter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An enhanced edition of the game, featuring voice acting and various other updates, was released in October 2015. A sequel to the game, titled ''[[Divinity: Original Sin II]]'', was released in September 2017.

==Gameplay==
''Original Sin'' is an RPG in the ''Divinity'' universe. ''Divinity: Original Sin'' concerns two heroes. The game touts turn-based combat, [[cooperative multiplayer]], an interactive world, and includes a modding tool used for creating new content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.divinityoriginalsin.com/news.php#news_232|title=Divinity - Original Sin|work=Divinity Original Sin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The [[player character|customizable protagonists]] of the game are a pair of "Source Hunters": members of an organization dedicated to eradicating a dangerous type of [[Magic in fiction|magic]] known as "Source" and its adepts, known as "Sourcerers". In the single-player mode, the player controls them both, while in the two-player co-op, each player takes control over one of them. At the start of the game, the Source Hunters receive orders to investigate the murder of a [[town council]]or by a suspected Sourcerer in Cyseal, a [[port town]] in southern Rivellon. Upon arrival, they find Cyseal under siege by [[orc]]s and [[undead]] and soon discover that it was orchestrated by a Sourcerer [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] linked to the Immaculates, a [[cult]] based in the Luculla Forest further inland. They also find evidence implicating the White Witch, guardian of the Luculla Forest, in the murder. Their search for her takes them to the [[Otherworld|fairy realm]] of Hibernheim, where they find her trapped in a block of ice by the Immaculates' leader, the Conduit. Upon being freed, she introduces herself as Icara and pleads guilty of [[manslaughter|accidentally killing]] the councilor, but the Source Hunters, having uncovered evidence of Sourcery, [[mass murder]], and [[human sacrifice]] carried out by the Immaculates, choose to ally themselves with her against the common foe. Icara reveals to them that the Conduit is actually her own estranged sister Leandra and directs them to infiltrate the Immaculates to learn of her plans. The Source Hunters discover that the cult has been mining a highly [[toxic metal]] named "tenebrium" in the Luculla Mines, where they also encounter "Death Knights", indestructible undead warriors created by Leandra using tenebrium and the Source to conquer Rivellon. Leandra destroys the mines in an attempt to kill the Source Hunters, but they manage to escape with her [[fail-safe]] that renders Death Knights vulnerable.

Throughout the game, the Source Hunters occasionally encounter magical crystals known as "[[meteorite|Star Stones]]" (some of them transformed into "blood stones" by the Immaculates' sacrifices). Upon finding the first one, they are transported to the "Homestead", a mysterious fortress outside of regular [[spacetime]] that is immediately familiar to both of them. As they recover more Star Stones, they learn from them that the Source had originally been a benevolent magic associated with [[Astarte]], the goddess of life, before it was corrupted by the Void, an evil force from outside of the material world. The Source Hunters themselves are revealed to be [[reincarnation]]s of two ancient [[general]]s, a man and a woman, who imprisoned the Source corruption inside an artifact known as "the God Box" and were granted godlike powers to guard it. However, when a [[demon]]ic being named "the Trife" persuaded Astarte to open the Box, the corruption was released again and took on the form of a giant [[dragon]], which Astarte went on to battle for eternity in the Void. As penance for their failure, the Guardians chose to be stripped of their powers and memories and were reborn in Rivellon as ordinary humans; the Star Stones are, in fact, crystallized fragments of their lost memories. Deducing that the Trife is now manipulating Leandra to weaken Astarte and to unleash the Void Dragon on the world, Icara urges the Source Hunters to stop her, either by restoring the "soulforge" between the sisters (a psychic link that Leandra had severed), or by killing her if necessary.

The Source Hunters follow the Conduit's trail to the town of Hunter's Edge near the Phantom Forest, now overrun by the Immaculates, orcs, and [[barbarian]] mercenaries. They find directions left behind by the wizard Zandalor, Icara's lover and Leandra's nemesis, that point them towards an ancient Source Temple hidden deeper in the woods. Inside the Temple, they find Zandalor and learn from him that Leandra's objective is the God Box in the First Garden, which they can enter from the Homestead. In the Garden, they confront Leandra and can restore her soulforge with Icara if they have unearthed the means therefor in the Phantom Forest earlier: in this case, she recognizes how evil she has become and leaves with Icara and Zandalor to [[repent]]; otherwise, they must fight and kill her. Reaching the God Box, the Source Hunters join forces with Astarte to destroy the Trife, but not before it summons the Void Dragon itself. In a titanic battle, they manage to banish the Dragon back into the Box, and Astarte stays to guard it again for all eternity, thanking the Source Hunters and revealing to them that other gods knowingly let the Source be corrupted. The Source Hunters then leave the First Garden to embark on a new adventure.

A crowdfunding campaign was launched on [[Kickstarter]] on 27 March 2013. By using the platform, Larian aimed to secure additional funds to expand the content of the game and the reactivity of the game world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/larianstudios/divinity-original-sin|title=Divinity: Original Sin|work=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kickstarter was successfully funded by 26 April, raising over $1,000,000, with the final budget being €4 million.&lt;ref name="eurogamer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-03-divinity-original-sin-larian-studios-fastest-selling-game-ever|title=Divinity: Original Sin Larian Studios' fastest-selling game ever|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=3 July 2014|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/04/27/divinity-original-sin-successfully-kickstarted-all-stretch-goals-met/|title=Divinity: Original Sin successfully Kickstarted, all stretch goals met|work=PC Gamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.on.net/2014/01/divinity-original-sin-now-available-on-steam-early-access/|title=Divinity: Original Sin now available on Steam Early Access|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was expected to be released in late 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/larianstudios/divinity-original-sin/comments?cursor=2562162#comment-25621 Kickstarter comment on release date]&lt;/ref&gt; but was delayed to 28 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/larianstudios/divinity-original-sin/posts/610368#comment-56746|title=Divinity:Original Sin Release Date Is Set — Kickstarter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release date was subsequently delayed again until 30 June 2014. Originally Larian intended to release Windows and OS X versions of the game simultaneously, and stated that once the OS X version was completed a Linux port would not be difficult. However, they decided to delay the OS X and Linux versions to focus on gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/larianstudios/divinity-original-sin/comments?cursor=2557837#comment-2557837 Kickstarter comment on PC/Mac/Linux versions]&lt;/ref&gt;

An enhanced edition version of the game, which includes new content, such as an expanded storyline and new gameplay options, was announced for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] consoles in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.divinityoriginalsin.com/blog.php?news=65|title=Announcing Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The re-issue was then released on October 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/larianstudios/divinity-original-sin/posts/1388342|title=Update #74: Countdown to Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition! |work=[[Kickstarter]]|date=2015-10-21|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console version of the game was published by [[Focus Home Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/15/8609995/divinity-original-sin-ehanced-edition-ps4-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc-mac|title=Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition coming to PS4, Xbox One with tons of new content|first=Philip|last=Kollar|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=May 15, 2015|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version was also free to all the players who have already purchased the PC version of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-announced/|title=Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition announced|first=Phil|last=Savage|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=May 15, 2015|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Divinity: Original Sin'' received generally favorable reception, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]],&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; where it was Larian's highest-rated game until ''Original Sin II'' released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/company/larian-studios?sort_options=metascore|title=Larian Studios's Profile|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game received highly positive reviews. ''Eurogamer'' described the game as "hands down the best classic-style RPG in years", and recommended the game to RPG fans, with the caveat that they should be up for a challenge. ''GameSpot'' praised the game for its complex systems, beautiful world, exciting turn-based combat, and its story.&lt;ref name=GameSpot/&gt; ''IGN'' wrote that the game was "one of the most rewarding RPGs to come along in years" and lauded its depth, personality, and combat challenges.&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; ''PC Gamer'' appreciated the freedom, simulation, depth, and respect for player's choices evident in the traditional RPG.&lt;ref name=pcgus/&gt; ''Hardcore Gamer'' stated that the lack of "hand holding" could discourage genre novices, and that the difficulty should be more consistent, but otherwise appreciated the game.

[[GameSpot]] named it the PC Game of the Year,&lt;ref name="GS_GotY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-pc-game-of-the-year/1100-6423910/|title=PC Game of the Year - Divinity: Original Sin - Best Games of 2014 - Game of the Year 2014|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] declared it "The Best Kickstarter Of 2014".&lt;ref name="RPS_BestKS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/12/12/best-kickstarter-2014-divinity-original-sin/|title=The Best Kickstarter Of 2014 - Divinity: Original Sin|date=12 December 2014|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a week of the game's release, the game had sold over 160,000 copies, and became Larian Studios' fastest-selling game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer1"/&gt; By September 2014, the game had sold over 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lar.net/2014/09/12/thoughts-after-releasing-divinityoriginal-sin-and-what-comes-next/|title=Thoughts after releasing Divinity:Original Sin and what comes next|last=Vincke|first=Swen|date=12 September 2014|publisher=lar.net|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dreadnought''''' is a [[combat flight simulation game]] developed by [[Six Foot]] and [[Yager Development]], and published by [[Grey Box (company)|Grey Box]]. Following a closed beta phase, the game was released for [[PlayStation 4]] in December 2017, followed by a release for [[Microsoft Windows]] in October 2018.

== Gameplay ==
The player is the captain of a large spacecraft and uses projectile weapons to attack. The player is able to choose between several classes of ships, each with drawbacks and advantages in categories like speed and size. The ships are massive and are intended to give the feel of being a commander, not a rogue bounty hunter. As a result, gameplay involves large amounts of strategy and positioning. In addition to positioning the ship and choosing targets, the player may also allocate power to various parts of the ship. These areas include shields, weapons and engines.&lt;ref name="PC_Gamer_E3_Preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/dreadnought-e3-preview/|title=Dreadnought E3 Preview|last1=Butterworth|first1=Scott|publisher=[[PC Gamer]]|date=15 June 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiplayer ===
In multiplayer, coordinated attacks and focus fire are important. Other players may choose to heal a damaged teammate. Matches last around ten minutes and players may switch ship classes after death depending on the match type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/06/12/dreadnought-goes-big-with-huge-ships.aspx|title=Dreadnought Goes Big with Huge Ships|last1=Tack|first1=Daniel|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|date=12 June 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Around the release of the steam version, co-developer Six Foot laid off 45 staff, approximately a third of its workforce.&lt;ref name="layoffs"&gt;https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/10/18/layoffs-at-dreadnought-developer-six-foot&lt;/ref&gt; Those affected were given the choice to either terminate their contracts or take an unpaid leave as long as the company struggled financially.&lt;ref name="layoffs" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">In [[television]] programming, '''flow''' is how [[channel (communications)|channels]] and [[Television network|networks]] try to hold their audience from [[television program|program]] to program, or from one segment of a program to another. Thus, it is the "flow" of television material from one element to the next. The term is also significant in [[television studies]], the academic analysis of the medium.  Media scholar [[Raymond Williams]] is responsible for first using the term in this sense.  He emphasized that flow is "the defining characteristic of broadcasting, simultaneously as a technology and as a cultural form."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Williams (2004/1974) ''Television. Technology and Cultural Form''. London: Routledge, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; "It is evident that what is now called 'an evening's viewing' is in some ways planned by providers and then by viewers as a whole; that it is in any event planned in discernible sequences which in this sense override particular program units".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Robert Fink, ''Repeating Ourselves: American Minimal Music as Cultural Practice'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005), 132. {{ISBN|0-520-24550-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams argued that ads glued programs together which created the sense of television flow with a shift "from the concept of sequence as ''programming'' to the concept of ''flow''."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Williams (2004/1974) ''Television. Technology and Cultural Form''. London: Routledge, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, the concept of flow has been threatened by new technologies and programming strategies that free the viewer from the old television model. [[VCRs]], [[DVDs]], [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]] (such as [[TiVo]]), [[Video on demand|Video-on-Demand]], and online video sources all allow the viewer to construct their own flow. They are no longer limited to a choice of three or four networks, as they were in the 1950s–1960s. Consequently, the concept of flow is  under attack and may not survive beyond the broadcast era of television.

==Production and purpose==
Williams claims that flow is determined by television's "stage of development," but [[Rick Altman]], Professor of Cinemas and Comparative Literature at the University of Iowa, argues that the culture of the medium produces and determines its flow.&lt;ref name=Altman&gt;Rick Altman, "Television/Sound," in ''Studies in Entertainment: Critical Approaches to Mass Culture'' ed. Tania Modleski (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986), 39-54.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that the soundtrack is unique to American culture and is one of the techniques that shapes the viewer's flow or his or her experience watching television. He notes that the soundtrack provides the viewer with sufficient plot, cues important events by sound (sound advance, e.g. clapping before it is seen on screen), and creates continuity.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt; These sonic elements create an intermittent flow of television. The goal is not to get the viewers to watch carefully, but to keep them from turning the television off.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

'''''Hlava Kasandry''''' (English: ''Cassandra's Head'') is a 1993 Czech video game, developed by Marek Nepožitek's company LetDisk and based on the Polish novel [[Głow Kasandra]]. It was released on the Atari ST but is compatible with Atari TT and Atari Falcon.

==Production==
The creators of the game worked in their free time. The development was influenced by the inexperience of developers who had to learn a lot of things during their work on the game. They included a number of features that they retrospectively deemed unnecessary. The game was then tested by friends of the game authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://letdisk.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/realizace/|title=Realizace|date=6 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piracy was a major issue at the time of the game. The authors therefore gave particular focus to copy protection. They had experience of copying games themselves, and therefore decided to create a particularly effective protection to prevent pirates from cracking the game. Unfortunately, this protection made it impossible to create physical copies or floppy images for use in emulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://letdisk.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/ochrana-proti-kopirovani/|title=Ochrana proti kopírování|date=6 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Marek Nepožitek, then a co-founder of Cinemax, decided to re-release ''Hlava Kasandry'', whose play on various platforms had previously been prevented by anti-piracy protection. He had to work around this, and did not find a solution until 2014; a free version for emulators was released in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://letdisk.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/zachrana-projektu/|title=Záchrana projektu|date=6 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atariportal.cz/news_detail.php?itmid=2001006|title=Česko-slovenský Atari portál: Hlava Kasandry - aktualizace|first=cs.atari.org|last=team|website=www.atariportal.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot and gameplay==
The game is set for the future, when a handful of people have to survive in a world destroyed by a massive nuclear conflict. The game follows the story of Teodor Hornice, who deals with the destruction of dangerous warheads. He must destroy a rocket name Kassandra that could destroy the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldgames.sk/mag/score-10/page/51/|title=Hlava Kasandry|last=Kment|first=Štěpán "Dawn"|date=1994|website=Score|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldgames.sk/mag/excalibur-24/page/13/|title=Hlava Kasandry|last=Chlebek|first=Jan "Ted Johnson"|date=1994|website=Excalibur|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is a mix of adventure, RPG and simulator. It is played with a joystick and a mouse. While players search for the missing rocket, they must pay attention to fuel and life while avoiding rasioactive areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hernisnob.cz/2010/05/hlava-kasandry.html|title=Hlava Kasandry|website=www.hernisnob.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://letdisk.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/hlava-kasandry/|title=Hlava Kasandry|date=6 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
At the time of release, the game was accepted by the reviewers. The game received a rating of 76% from Narsil and 71% from Excalibur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldgames.sk/mag/narsil-5/page/4/|title=Hlava Kasandry|last=Rous|first=Karel "Empty Head"|date=1994|website=Narsil|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldgames.sk/mag/excalibur-34/page/30/|title=Hlava Kasandry|last=Kment|first=Štěpán "Dawn"|date=1994|website=Excalibur|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hotel television systems''' (sometimes also referred to as '''Hotel TV''') is the in-suite television content presented in [[hotel]]-rooms, other hotel environments and in the hospitality industry for in-room entertainment, as well as [[hospital]]s, assisted living, senior care and  [[nursing home]]s. These services may be free for the guest or paid, depending on the service and the individual hotel's or hotel chain’s policy. Generally these services are controlled by using the remote control.

==Services==
Hotel television is generally available as free to guest services, which may include local channels and satellite or cable programming, or as interactive television, which provides services such as [[video on demand]] or any other paid services including movies, music, adult content, and other services.  In some cases hotel TV also means a bundle of interactive services that are made available on a guest's TV screen such as a hotel welcome screen with hotel information, hotel services, an information portal with weather, news &amp; local attractions, video games, internet applications, internet television, movie rental services, and order &amp; shopping for the hotel’s amenities.

===Satellite television===
Commonly a hotel television system distributing satellite television signal is known as a Satellite Master Antenna TV (SMATV) system.  In an L-band distribution system television signal is sent from the satellite dish to a panel in a distribution closet to a set top box in each room which decrypts the digital signal via a coaxial network.  In a Headend type system, the signal is encrypted by a Qam at the headend to prevent piracy and then distributed via a COM3000 from Technicolor,  or similar hotel television headend.  In an IPTV system, all video, voice and data are transmitted over an internal hotel IP network.

===Cable and Satellite television systems===
In cable or satellite TV systems, signal may be distributed via a coaxial network of IP networks to a set-top box in each room.

===Signal distribution===
Satellite television, cable television and over-the-air (OTA) signals as well as locally generated programming such as hotel guest welcome screens and other hotel information and services can be distributed via an L-Band type system, COM3000 HD/4K Pro:Idiom Headend from Technicolor, or an IPTV type distribution system.  In most hotels, a television signal provided by a satellite television or cable television provider or OTA antenna is transmitted over a hotel coaxial cable network. Most hotels today are wired only with coaxial cables. Some newer hotels are pre-wired with UTP or CAT-5/6 cabling, which enables IP-based hotel television services. For hotels wired with coaxial cable, technology has emerged recently which enables some to take advantage of IP-based signal transmission over coax cables.

The {{nihongo|'''Kubosō Memorial Museum of Arts, Izumi'''|和泉市久保惣記念美術館|Izumi-shi Kubosō Kinen Bijutsukan}} opened in [[Izumi, Osaka|Izumi]], [[Osaka Prefecture]], Japan, in 1982. The new wing was added in 1997. The local Kubo family, founders of the Kubosō cotton textile business, donated the land, buildings, collection, and funds for the Museum's management to the city. The collection of some eleven thousand works includes two [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasures]] (the ''Kasen [[Uta-awase]]'' scroll and the [[Song dynasty#Southern Song, 1127–1279|Southern Song]] [[celadon]] vase with [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] ears known as Bansei) and twenty-nine&lt;!--not 28 - a new designation--&gt; [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bunka.nii.ac.jp/museums/detail/455 |script-title=ja:和泉市久保惣記念美術館 |trans-title=Kubosō Memorial Museum of Arts, Izumi |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ikm-art.jp/en/foreword.html |title=Forward |publisher=Kubosō Memorial Museum of Arts, Izumi |accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=614 |script-title=ja:歌仙歌合 |trans-title=Kasen Uta-awase |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=314 |script-title=ja:青磁鳳凰耳花生〈銘万声／〉|trans-title=Celadon Vase with Phoenix Ears, known as Bansei |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British film industry produced over six hundred feature films in [[2014 in film|2014]]. This article fully lists all non-pornographic films, including short films, that had a release date in that year and which were at least partly made by the United Kingdom. It does not include films first released in previous years that had release dates in 2014. &lt;br&gt; Also included is an overview of the major events in British film, including film festivals and awards ceremonies, as well as lists of those films that have been particularly well received, both critically and financially. The year was particularly notable for a number of large-scale co-productions with the United States, such as ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'', ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'' and ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''.

[[File:Arjunanritham.JPG|thumb|Arjuna Nritham]]
'''Mayilpeeli Thookkam''' also called '''Arjuna Nritham''' (the dance of [[Arjuna]]) is a ritual art of [[Kerala]] performed by men of vilkurupp and ezhava mainly and is prevalent in the [[Bhagavathy]] temples of south [[Kerala]], mainly in [Kottayam, [[Alappuzha]]  districts.  In the epic ''[[Mahabharatha]]'', [[Arjuna]] was the most valiant of the five heroic brothers, the Pandavas, and was also a renowned singer and dancer and is said to have propitiated goddess [[Bhadrakali]] by a devotional presentation.

Arjuna nritham is also called "Mayilpeeli Thookkam" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the "uduthukettu" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques. The dance in mayilpeelithookkam is known as ''Pyattu''.The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.

The strictly rhythm based songs  called as "Kavithangal" and deal with various themes of the [[Purana]]s (ancient [[Hindu]] scriptures). Each "Kavitham" is composed to suit a specific rhythm.  Before each song, the dancers explain the intricacies of the particular rhythm about to be employed and how this rhythm is translated into dance movements. Percussion instruments like the [[chenda]], , [[talachenda]] and [[ilathalam]] (cymbal) form the musical accompaniment.&lt;ref name = "ezh22"&gt;Ronald M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16114">[[File:Anne of Green Gables.jpg|thumb|Actors at the ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'' museum on Prince Edward Island]]

'''Museum theatre''' is the use of [[theatre]] and theatrical techniques by a [[museum]] for educational, informative, and entertainment purposes.  It can also be used in a [[zoo]], an [[aquarium]], an [[art gallery]], and at historic sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Catherine|first2=Anthony |last2=Jackson |first3=Jenny |last3=Kidd |title=The Role of Theater in Museums and Historic Sites: Visitors, Audiences, and Learners|journal=International Handbook of Research in Arts Education|year=2007|volume=16|pages=679–699|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-3052-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally performed by professional actors.  Varieties of museum theatre include historical characters, puppetry, movement and music.

== Overview ==
[[Actor]]s portraying historical characters perform in [[First-person interpretation|first person]], as if he or she were an actual person from the era or culture he or she is representing.  With puppetry, actors can tell stories, create multiple characters, and portray a variety of cultures.

Theatrical techniques can be used for [[Third-person narrative|third-person]] interpretation, where an actor or trained presenter uses costumes, props. lighting, or special effects to convey historical or scientific facts, without necessarily portraying a character.&lt;ref name="Tessa"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bridal|first1=Tessa|title=Exploring Museum Theatre|date=2004|publisher=Altamira Press|location=Walnut Creek|isbn=0-7591-0413-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum theatre pioneers include the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]], the [[Museum of Science, Boston]], the [[National Gallery of Art]], and the [[Philadelphia Zoo]].&lt;ref name="Tessa"/&gt;

The Theatre in Museums Workshop, begun in 1983 at the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]], is an annual event now held at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]].  It provides all the basic information needed to start a theatre program, and an opportunity to develop scripts under the guidance of experienced museum theatre practitioners.

== First-person interpretation ==

First-person interpretation is an increasingly popular way of creating a full-body experience for museum visitors by giving them the opportunity to interact with the past through actors and interpreters.

[[File:Lyme Regis Fossil Festival 09 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Actors portraying [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Mary Anning]] at the [[Lyme Regis]] fossil festival]]
Historical character interpretation is increasingly becoming the way all first-person interpretation is performed because it adds a high degree of authenticity to a given museum performance or interpretation.&lt;ref name="Tessa"/&gt; This movement corresponds with the increase in focus on the educational benefit of the museum to the visitor as opposed to the previously held belief that the visitor is a secondary concern to the objects. While this has been a strong movement since about 1980, the concern for accuracy and consequent focus on portraying real people is a marker that can be interpreted as a new stage.

One of the main ways that museum theatre differs from museum interpretation is in the degree of disbelief involved in the performance; representing a historical figure requires less [[suspension of disbelief]] because the audience knows that the character being represented did exist. It is easier for an audience to believe that the performer is accurately representing a figure that they themselves can verify existed.&lt;ref name="Tessa"/&gt;

The portrayal of a historical character in a museum environment as opposed to a traditional theatrical space is hard to define. The main distinction is perhaps that the actor in the museum environment must be prepared to interact with the audience, while the stage actor is not expected to know much about his character beyond what is developed on-stage. While acting the characters are subject to similar acting conventions, the museum actor must be prepared to answer to his audience face-to-face. The final distinction to be made is that the portrayal of a historical character is a performance of living history, as opposed to museum theatre. In taking on the identity of a person who truly lived, you are expected to become that person, which involves answering to that person’s actions, ideologies, and life experiences.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite book|last=Roth|first=Stacy|title=Past into Present: Effective Techniques for First-person Historical Interpretation|year=1998|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=978-0-8078-4710-7|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second-person interpretation ==
[[Second-person narrative|Second-person]] interpretation is a newer form of interpretation in which visitors participate in programming and hands-on activities, as opposed to only engaging in dialogue with interpreters.&lt;ref name="mag"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magelssen|first=Scott|title=Making History in the Second Person: Post-touristic Considerations for Living Historical Interpretation|journal=Theatre Journal|date=May 2006|volume=58|issue=2|pages=291-312|doi=10.1353/tj.2006.0119}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|298}} It is employed most often in [[living history museum]]s and can be used in conjunction with first- or third-person interpretation. Common hands-on activities include candle-dipping, butter churning, weaving on a loom, and musket loading.{{r|mag|page1=291}} This form of second-person interpretation does not necessarily require the visitor to adopt a character or pretend to be part of the past. In another form, more similar to [[participatory theatre]], visitors are invited to adopt a character and interact with interpreters as that character.{{r|mag|page1=300}} One example is the "Follow the North Star" program at [[Conner Prairie]] Interactive History Park in Indiana, where visitors pretend to be fugitive slaves as a way of learning about the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Follow the North Star|url=http://www.connerprairie.org/things-to-do/events/follow-the-north-star|website=Conner Prairie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, such interactions are carefully facilitated so that a desired outcome is achieved, but sometimes visitors are allowed to make their own choices regardless of the historical record. Allowing visitors to portray prominent historical figures and make their own choices is done less frequently because of concerns over historical accuracy.{{r|mag|page1=304}} Many educators support role-playing as a way for visitors to learn by doing, think critically about history, and make personal connections between history and their own lives.&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt;

==Demonstration==
[[File:Conner-prairie-pottery.jpg|thumb|A pottery wheel demonstration at [[Conner Prairie]] living history museum.]]
Demonstration is a form of museum interpretation that has been used in museums, historic sites, [[zoos]], and [[aquarium|aquaria]] for decades. Demonstration is a way to illustrate activities such as historical [[craft]]-making and concepts like scientific principles.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Catherine |date=1998 |title=Museum Theatre: Communicating with Visitors Through Drama |location=Portsmouth, NH |publisher=Heinemann|isbn=9780325000565}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37–38}} It is also a way to contextualize a museum object or artifact.&lt;ref name="Boardman"&gt;{{cite web |last=Boardman |first=Kathryn |date=1997 |url=http://www.alhfam.org/whitepapers/alhfam.revisit.html |title=Revisiting Living History: A Business, An Art, A Pleasure, An Education |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724233240/http://www.alhfam.org/whitepapers/alhfam.revisit.html |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a demonstration, the demonstrator generally explains the activity or concept using something "real" like an object or animal.{{r|Hughes|page1=37–38}} In traditional demonstrations, the demonstrators generally do not assume to be anyone else (characterization might be involved in more theatrical demonstrations).{{r|Hughes|page1=38}} One example of a demonstration is fish feeding at the [[New England Aquarium]], in which visitors watch a diver feed fish while listening to a volunteer explain the process.{{r|Hughes|page1=38}} Another example is the lightning presentation at the [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Museum of Science]], Boston during which visitors watch lightning flashes produced by a [[Van de Graaff generator]].{{r|Hughes|page1=38}} There is a great deal of overlap between demonstration and theatre. Theatrical techniques such as [[characterization]], [[costume]], [[narrative]], and [[special effects]] are often used to enliven demonstration and draw visitor attention.{{r|Hughes|page1=37–38}} Some museums, such as [[Science Museum (London)|The National Museum of Science and Industry]] in London, classify demonstration as a form of museum theatre,{{r|Tessa|page1=5}} while other museums, such as the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]], use actors to present demonstrations.{{r|Tessa|page1=xii}} Demonstration may also serve as a component of a museum play or theatre piece.&lt;ref name="Schindel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schindel |first=Dorothy Napp |date=Summer 2002 |title=Museum Theatre: Telling Stories Through Objects |journal=Stage of the Art |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, differences remain between the conventions of demonstration and the conventions of theatre. In her book ''Exploring Museum Theatre'', Tessa Bridal warns museums against promoting a demonstration as a theatre performance, as it may cause visitor confusion or disappointment.{{r|Tessa|page1=5}} Yet like museum theatre and other forms of live interpretation, demonstration aims to engage visitors, to create interest in a topic, to serve as an alternative to lists of facts and static exhibitions, and to provoke an emotional response that leads to learning.{{r|Hughes|page1=39}}{{r|Tessa|page1=4}}

==Storytelling==
[[Storytelling]] is a discipline that has a history as long as the human race.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Storytellers inhabit the [[character (arts)|character]]s of the tale, while still maintaining the status as [[narrator]] of the events, they are both first person and third person perspectives in one.  Storytelling can help bring historical and cultural context to works of art, dinosaur bones, scientific and historical objects.{{r|Hughes|page1=65}} For this reason some museums will hire a contract storyteller to add depth and experience to exhibitions or programs by spinning children's tales, appearing as a costume character to aid in an immersive environment and to aid in depicting different cultures by sharing [[traditions]], histories, [[folklore]] and [[myths]].{{r|Tessa|page1=19–21}}

Museum theatre often adapts the archetypal storyteller to a character embodied by a trained and scripted actor. It is important to note that part of the art of storytelling is the development of the storyteller's [[persona]] and their unique style of performing,{{r|Tessa|page1=19–21}} which is similar to the creation of a character intrinsic to the acting discipline and the Theatre genre. Some purists believe that creating a theatrical piece embodying the stories and myths of a culture without the native storyteller present, is a perversion and denigration of cultural patrimony. However, professionals in museum theatre believe that the most important part of creating meaningful experiences using others' stories is that the stories and the culture they represent are handled with respect and every effort is made to portray them accurately.{{r|Hughes|page1=66}}  

Despite some detractors museums are beginning to integrate many aspects of museum theatre into their daily programming schedule.  This is probably due to recently scholarly discourse in the field of museum education that links multi-sensory experiences like storytelling with effective learning in children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falk|first1=John|last2=Dierking|first2=Lynn|title=Learning from Museums: Visitor Experiences and the Making of Meaning|year=2000|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Walnut Creek|isbn=9780759117198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storytelling is a particularly effective type of museum theatre because children's cognitive and empathetic abilities are increased when they are asked to listen and follow the sequence of events presented by storytellers. To quote Catherine Hughes, {{quote|Juxtaposing stories (an ancient way of understanding) and science [or history, or art, etc](a new approach to understanding) creates more models and pictures for the listener, which makes for a deeper, more complex, and complete awareness of the natural world.{{r|Hughes|page1=67}}}}

==Dance/music performance==

[[Dance]] and [[music]] [[performance]] within museum theatre take on many different forms. While they can be used separately, dance and music are also used in conjunction with other forms of museum theatre, including each other, to enhance the visitor’s experience. Music as either an instrumental or vocal performance should be performed by qualified performers. The same goes for a dance performance that is either choreographed or improvised.{{r|Tessa|page1=26}} However, in other circumstances, such as after a performance or in a special program, music and dance can be explored by the visitor in a more participatory way. This helps to enhance their understanding and interpretation of the ideas and concepts the museum is trying to encourage. 

Even within a performance museums use music and dance in different ways. Music has been used as a cultural performance to show and explore different cultures through the use of music. In other cases music performance has been used to help visitors discover more about the music and instruments themselves, such as the Exploratorium, in San Francisco. They held a series of informal concerts at which, after the musician gave his or her performance, the audience were given the opportunity to converse with the musician and ask question.{{r|Tessa|page1=26}} Dance performance, presented on its own is unusual. It is often used in addition to or as a part of another museum theatre piece. There are however a few sole dance performances in museums. The Weisman holds a performance entitled ''Eddy'' that uses the museum building itself as the stage. To help visitors look at the building differently, the dancers move through the space walking up walls, using the elevator as a dance floor, and other unusual ways. The museum wants the visitor to appreciate not only the exhibits in the museum, but the building itself.{{r|Tessa|page1=27}} 

When used together dance and music provide another opportunity for museums to educate. A good example of this is ''The Ballad of Chico Mendes''. The Museum of Science, in Boston used choreographed dance and music, both as song and for background, to teach visitors about the battle for the rainforest through the life of Chico Mendes, a rubber tapper. Not only did they perform this in the museum, but latter took it “on the road” to schools in the area.{{r|Hughes|page1=86–87}} 

Using dance and music in museum theatre allows the museum to evoke greater emotion within a performance, connecting to the visitor on a different level. Music especially helps to set the stage of not only a musical or dance performance, but more traditional theatre and program pieces as well.{{r|Tessa|page1=26}}

'''National Theatre Workshop of the Handicapped''' (NTWH) was a [[New York City]]-based repertory theatre company and theatre school, providing training and performing space for writers and performers with disabilities, founded in 1977 by Father Rick Curry, S.J.{{sfn|Goldstein|2012|p=187-8}} NTWH had programs for acting, singing, voice, writing, and theatre production, and thousands of theatre students and performers with disabilities participated in the company's programs in New York City as well as a campus in [[Belfast, Maine]].

==History==
Father Rick Curry's interest in performing became a major activity during his years in university. He gained experience in theatre and television commercial work.{{sfn|Goldstein|2012|p=187-8}} His university graduate studies were in theatre arts, which led to a PhD in the field from [[New York University]].

Curry, born without a right hand and forearm, had his first experience with open discrimination against his disability allegedly when he tried to audition for a role in a mouthwash commercial, and the receptionist burst out laughing, assuming he had been sent in as a joke.{{sfn|Goldstein|2012|p=187-8}} Months later, he founded NTWH in 1977 in [[Lower Manhattan]].

The company's goals included training students in communication skills that would help them in professional theatre, and to "enhance their opportunities in the workplace".{{sfn|Theatre Communications Group|2010|p=510-1}} Theatre schools commonly overlooked or excluded students who have a disability; so NTWH helped address this problem, offering courses in academic subjects and also practical theatre skills. NTWH aimed to "create a theatrical arena in which disabled and able-bodied actors and playwrights collaborate, train, and perform together". Community events were also held to stage dramatic works dealing with "themes of disability".{{sfn|Rogers|Henry|2007|p=222}}

Curry brought a new focus to projects involving disabled veterans. The Writers’ Program for Wounded Warriors provided a forum for veterans to write dramatic monologues about their war experiences.{{sfn|Coronado|2009}}

Curry was a member of the Roman [[Catholic]] [[Jesuit]] order for more than 50 years, first as a Jesuit Brother, and more recently, as a priest and Chaplain at [[Georgetown University]]. Curry maintained that his theatre values reflected his Jesuit training:{{blockquote|''Eloquentia perfecta'', the perfection of eloquence, is the end result of Jesuit education,” Curry said. “The student can stand on his or her own two feet and defend what he or she believes. This is what I wanted to do for the disabled, who have been ignored for so long. People never asked them what they thought or how they felt, so once you have empowered a disabled person artistically, you have in fact empowered a disabled person.”{{sfn|Coronado|2009}}}}

===Maine projects===
NTWH expanded its scope in 1996, launching a campus in Belfast, Maine, as a seasonal adjunct, and purchasing a local school from the city.{{sfn|Curtis|2012}} A variety of projects were run through NTWH's Belfast campus, such as a theatre workshop, a fine arts gallery, a baking school, and a bakery in Belfast, all managed by people with disabilities.{{sfn|Goldstein|2012|p=187-8}} The Maine facility was also residential and fully [[accessibility|accessible]].{{sfn|Theatre Communications Group|2010|p=511}} NTWH's Belfast projects additionally included Summer theatre camps for children, both with and without disabilities.{{sfn|Whitehouse|2003|p=7}}

===Decline===
Beginning in 2004, NTWH began having several financial problems which caused it to go into arrears on mortgage payments both with its New York studio and Belfast campus. This nearly culminated in a [[foreclosure]] auction in 2005,{{sfn|Groening|2005}} though NTWH was able to temporarily satisfy its debts by selling auxiliary buildings in Belfast.  Later years, however, were more difficult for NTWH, and in 2010 the City of Belfast temporarily seized the Maine campus for non-payment of a sewer bill.{{sfn|Curtis|2010}}{{sfn|Curtis|2012}} Belfast City Manager Joe Slocum toured the building in January 2011 and found it abandoned and neglected.{{sfn|City of Belfast|2011}} In January 2017, a local Belfast resident purchased the building with plans to renovate it for multi-functional use.  {{sfn|http://bangordailynews.com/2017/01/05/business/new-owner-plans-co-housing-performance-space-for-old-belfast-high-school/}}

NTWH's New York ensemble gave a final performance on August 25, 2008, in Sag Harbour, New York, before suspending its operations. NTWH's final production was titled ''In Honour of Service'', a performance of monologues written by participants in the NTWH Writer's Program for Wounded Warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Theatre Workshop of the Handicapped – Final Performance|url=http://jlspalla.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/launching-mysite-recent-performance/|publisher=John Spalla|accessdate=July 26, 2012|date=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the former members of NTWH Cabaret, a project of the larger NTWH, continue performing in New York City as of 2011, and they have reformed in a new performing organization called Encompassing Voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘NTWH Cabaret’ Reborn as ‘Encompassing Voices’|url=http://jlspalla.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/ntwh-cabaret-reborn-as-encompassing-voices/|publisher=John Spalla|accessdate=July 26, 2012|date=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rick Curry died on December 19, 2015 in Philadelphia, PA after a long, undisclosed illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncronline.org/news/people/richard-curry-jesuit-who-served-people-disabilities-and-veterns-has-died]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7800">'''Neo-noir''' is a modern or contemporary [[motion picture]] rendition of [[film noir]]. The term film noir (popularised by two French critics, namely, [[:fr:Raymond Borde|Raymond Borde]] and Etienne Chaumeton, in 1955)&lt;ref name="borde"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borde|first1=Raymond|authorlink1=:fr:Raymond Borde|last2=Chaumeton|first2=Etienne|title=A panorama of American film noir (1941-1953)|date=2002|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0872864122|url=https://archive.org/details/BordeAndChaumetonPanoramaOfAmericanFilmNoir19411953}}&lt;/ref&gt; was applied to crime movies of the 1940s and 1950s, most produced in the United States. It meant dark movie, indicating a sense of something sinister and shadowy, but also expressing a style of cinematography. The film noir genre includes stylish [[Hollywood]] [[Crime film|crime dramas]], often with a twisted dark wit. Neo-noir has a similar style but with updated themes, content, style, visual elements or media.

Neo-noir, as the term suggests, is contemporary noir. The film directors knowingly refer to 'classic noir' in the use of tilted [[camera angle]]s, interplay of light and shadows, unbalanced [[Framing (visual arts)|framing]]; blurring of the lines between [[Good and evil|good and bad]] and [[Ethics|right and wrong]], and a [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of [[revenge]], [[paranoia]], and [[Alienation effect|alienation]], among other [[sensibilities]].

==Definition==
The term "neo-noir" is a contraction of the phrase "new [[film noir]]", using the Greek prefix for the word "new" rendered as "neo" (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[neo (disambiguation)|neo]]''). "Noir", when used as an isolated term in film theory and critique, is a short form reference to "film noir". As a neologism, neo-noir is defined by Mark Conard as "defining any film coming after the classic noir period that contains noir themes and noir sensibility".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Conard. ''The Philosophy of Neo-noir''. The Univ of Kentucky Press, 2007, p2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Film noir}}
The term "[[film noir]]" (French for "black film" or "dark film") was coined by critic [[Nino Frank]] in 1946, and popularized by French critics [[:fr:Raymond Borde|Raymond Borde]] and Etienne Chaumeton in 1955.&lt;ref name="borde"/&gt; The term became revived in general use beginning in the 1980s, with a revival of the style. 

The classic era of film noir is usually dated to a period between the early 1940s and the late 1950s; the films were often adaptations of American crime novels of the era, which were also described as "hardboiled". Some authors resisted these terms. For example, [[James M. Cain]], author of ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1934) and ''[[Double Indemnity (novel)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1943), is considered to be one of the defining authors of hard-boiled fiction. Both these novels were adapted as crime films, the former more than once. But Cain is quoted as saying, "I belong to no school, hard-boiled or otherwise, and I believe these so-called schools exist mainly in the imagination of critics, and have little correspondence in reality anywhere else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hardboiled America – The Lurid Years of Paperbacks |last=O'Brien |first=Geoffrey |year=1981 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |location=New York; Cincinnati |isbn=0-442-23140-7 |pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically American [[crime drama]]s or [[psychological thriller]]s, films noir{{Ref label|A|a|none}} had a number of common themes and plot devices, and many distinctive visual elements. Characters were often conflicted [[antihero]]es, trapped in a difficult situation and making choices out of desperation or [[nihilism|nihilistic]] [[Morality|moral systems]]. Visual elements included [[low-key lighting]], striking use of [[Chiaroscuro|light and shadow]], and unusual camera placement.

Although there have been few new major films in the classic film noir genre since the early 1960s, it has had significant impact on other genres.{{citation need|date=December 2017}} These films usually incorporate both thematic and visual elements reminiscent of film noir. Both classic and neo-noir films are often produced as [[independent films|independent features]].

It was not until after 1970 that film critics took note of "neo-noir" films as a separate genre. Noir and post-noir terminology (such as "[[Hardboiled|hard-boiled]]", "neo-classic" and the like) are often denied by both critics and practitioners alike. 

Robert Arnett stated that "Neo-noir has become so amorphous as a genre/movement, any film featuring a detective or crime qualifies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arnett |first1=Robert |year=Fall 2006 |title=Eighties Noir: The Dissenting Voice in Reagan's America |journal=[[Journal of Popular Film and Television]] |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=123–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter and director [[Larry Gross]], identifies ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]'', alongside [[John Boorman]]’s ''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]'' (1967) and [[Robert Altman]]’s ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), based on Raymond Chandler's 1953 novel, as neo-noir films. Gross believes that they deviate from the classic noir films in having more of a sociological than a psychological focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/fast-track-fandom-where-begin-neo-noir|title=Where to begin with neo-noir|work=British Film Institute|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pacific Comics''' (PC) was an independent [[comic book]] publisher that flourished from 1981-1984. It was also a chain of comics shops and a distributor. It began out of a [[San Diego, California]], comic book shop owned by brothers [[Bill Schanes|Bill]] and Steve Schanes.  Along with competitors like [[First Comics]] and [[Eclipse Comics]], PC took early advantage of the growing [[direct market]], attracting a number of writers and artists from [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] to produce [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] titles, which were not subject to the [[Comics Code]], and thus were free to feature more mature content.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1971, the Schanes brothers (Steve Schanes, age 17, and Bill Schanes, age 13&lt;ref name="DAK54"/&gt;) co-founded Pacific Comics, which started out as a mail-order company, selling to consumers via ads in the ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]''. This led to advertisements inside some [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comics, and ultimately to tangible retail stores. The first Pacific Comics store opened in [[Pacific Beach, California]], in 1974, and business was soon doing so well that the brothers realized they "couldn't get merchandise" for the stores, and so set up a distribution system, which was soon supplying neighboring stores also.&lt;ref name="Sanford"&gt;[[Jay Allen Sanford|Sanford, Jay Allen]]. [http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2004/aug/19/two-men-and-their-comic-books/ "Two Men and their Comic Books]," ''[[San Diego Reader]]'' (Aug. 19, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The move from newsstand distribution to the [[direct market]] (non-returnable, heavily-discounted, direct purchasing of comics from publishers) happened in the 1970s, in large part due to the work of [[Phil Seuling]] and his [[Sea Gate Distributors]] company (founded in 1972), as well as a number of individuals, including the Schanes brothers and [[Bud Plant]]. The direct-market went hand-in-hand with the creation of specialist comics shops to cater to the collectors who could then buy [[Comics vocabulary#Back Issue|back issues]] months after a newsstand issue had disappeared. By the late 1970s, thanks partly to the success of films such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'', comics were selling well, and Pacific expanded its distribution system nationwide, raising $200,000 by closing its four San Diego retail locations and selling off inventory, rising rapidly to the top of the new distribution system.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

In the six years between 1974 and 1980, comic or fantasy-related specialty shops rose from numbering 200-300 to around 1500, while Pacific was operating out of a {{convert|2200|sqft|m2|adj=on}} office-warehouse in [[Kearny Mesa]], with 500 wholesale accounts. According to elder brother Steve, the company "grossed just under a million dollars that year," soon doubling its floorspace.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

=== Publishing ===
In 1979, Pacific dipped its feet into publishing when they released ''Warriors of Shadow Realm'', a [[John Buscema]] portfolio of six signed, colored plates&lt;ref&gt;[http://mike.jersey.free.fr/Buscema.htm "The John Buscema Checklist", by Michel Maillot]&lt;/ref&gt; meant to accompany a [[Doug Moench]] and Buscema three-issue [[Weirdworld]] epic-fantasy tale which ran in ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special]]'' #11-13 (June-Oct. 1979).

In 1981, rival distributor [[Capital City Distribution|Capital City]] launched a black-and-white title, ''[[Nexus (comics)|Nexus]]'',&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; and distributed it through their own system. The Schanes brothers took note, and decided to follow suit, even though they were still paying off debt from a $300,000 bank loan taken out in 1979 at 25 percent interest. Steve — who, with a degree in sculpture had a background in art — handled negotiations with creators, while Bill took on the business and accounting end. The brothers turned to [[Jack Kirby]]. Steve Schanes recalled, "I figured if you want to get people's attention with a new comic book, who better to do it with than the King of Comics, Jack Kirby! We were already friends with Jack. We used to send him free copies of comics he'd drawn for other publishers because they never sent him any! So I just went ahead and called him on the phone, and he turned out to be a nice guy, completely accessible. . . . We negotiated a whole detailed publishing deal between the two of us. No middlemen."&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

The Schaneses asked Kirby, who had effectively quit comics in 1977, for only the publishing rights, assuring him that he could keep full ownership and copyrights, and said they would even help him license characters for use overseas or in other media. Thus, Pacific claims to have become the first company to pay royalty payments to Kirby.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; Kirby provided Pacific with ''[[Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Jack Kirby Returns to Comics with Cosmic Hero," ''The Comics Journal'' #65 (Aug. 1981), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; which was published bimonthly from August 1981. Though the Schaneses anticipated sales of less than 25,000, the first issue sold 110,000 copies.&lt;ref name="DAK54"&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark | last = Borax | date = January 1988 | title = Steve Schanes (part 1) | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 33–39 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby then let Pacific publish his ''[[Silver Star (comics)|Silver Star]]'', and the brothers decided to start a line of full-color mainstream comic books.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

Before long, Pacific had attracted interest from other comics professionals, including [[Mike Grell]] (who recalls that he was actually the first to sign with Pacific by a couple of weeks, but that Kirby's work was published first because he "delivered his first."&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;) who had planned his ''[[Starslayer]]'' to appear from DC, but after it dropped from the schedule, the Schaneses approached him about publishing it.

Another invitee was then-aspiring artist [[Dave Stevens]], who purchased comics from Pacific's shops and had met the brothers at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in 1981. When ''Starslayer'' #2 came up short a few pages, Stevens was approached to fill in the remaining pages, and ultimately came up with ''[[The Rocketeer]]''.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

=== Experimentation and expansion ===
In 1983 Pacific upgraded to paper with higher quality ink.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Pacific Upgrades All Titles to White paper," ''The Comics Journal'' #84 (September 1983), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Pacific's innovations in creator-owned properties and high-quality printings were soon imitated by industry leaders [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

Pacific continued to distribute and publish comics, running both operations from a San Diego warehouse to which they'd moved in July 1982. They also purchased a firehouse in [[Steeleville, Illinois]] and converted it into a distribution hub. It was also operating warehouses in L.A. and Phoenix at the time. Printing about 500,000 comic books every month, the Schanses employed around forty people at their San Diego operation alone, and were grossing over $3.5 million per annum.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

The brothers hired their father, Steven E. Schanes, as financial vice president and their mother (Christine Marra) as office manager. Elder brother Paul "Pablo" worked in the financial records department, and sister Chris, an L.A.-based attorney, provided counsel on legal affairs.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

=== Later output ===
Pacific's published output contained editorials by [[David Scroggy]], who had started as a comics retailer in 1975, and risen to general manager of Pacific's four San Diego shops by the late 1970s. He helped to bring the reclusive [[Steve Ditko]] to Pacific.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

Ditko's Pacific offering ''[[Missing Man]]'' was previewed in ''Captain Victory'' #6, and then featured in issues of ''Pacific Presents''. His work was scripted by [[Mark Evanier]]. Meanwhile, Pacific published a magazine-sized black-and-white reprint of [[Rog-2000|Rog 2000]] stories that [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] had done in the '70s for [[Charlton Comics]], as well as a number of titles under its parent company '''Blue Dolphin Enterprises.'''&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; It also welcomed [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] to the company, and [[Sergio Aragonés]] and [[Mark Evanier]]'s ''[[Groo the Wanderer]]''.

===3-D, Elric, and falling sales===
By 1984, Steve Schanes decided to bring back [[Stereoscopy|3-D]] to comics, a fleeting trend in the 1950s that had then been stymied by poor printing separations. [[Ray Zone]] was hired to do the production, after he had successfully converted a Kirby image for [[Honeycomb (cereal)|Honeycomb cereal]]. Steve Schanes decided the 3-D book would be ''[[Alien Worlds|Alien Worlds 3-D]]'', featuring the first published work of [[Art Adams]], alongside [[John Bolton (comics)|John Bolton]], [[Bill Wray]] and others. Sales on the expensively-produced comic, however, were poor, and sales all round were following suit. One-shots became more common, and tolerable sales on ''[[Elric (comics)|Elric of Melniboné]]'' stumbled when [[First Comics]] acquired the rights, putting Pacific in the awkward position of continuing as distributor on a comic from a rival publisher that they had helped promote.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

=== Competition and collapse ===
After organizational difficulties pushed back the release of ''Starslayer'' by several months, Mike Grell decided to take his creator-owned property to [[First Comics]], and a domino effect began to occur as the loss of a high-profile title to a rival publisher engendered bad industry PR, leading other creators to lose faith in Pacific.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

More importantly, the distribution arm of Pacific was suffering serious problems, due in part to overly-generous credit extensions to retailers, which were not paid back as quickly as expected. Thus, Steve Schanes explained:
{{quote|Most of our comic books still made money hand over fist, but there was a big problem in distribution. We extended too much credit to retailers who didn't pay us on a timely basis, and we were already working on a minuscule profit margin, maybe five percent to eight percent. We didn't push hard enough to get the money from receivables, who owed us hundreds of thousands of dollars. If you had to boil down the single biggest reason we blew it, that would be our poor cash management on the distribution side.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;}}

Pacific's publication arm was also attracting competitors, and Pacific found itself distributing competitors' (including [[Kitchen Sink Press]], [[Last Gasp]] and [[Rip Off Press]]) titles. With this in mind, other publishers (including Capital City (whose ''Nexus'' comic outsold several Pacific titles), [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], [[Aardvark-Vanaheim]], [[Educomics]], [[Quality Comics|Quality]], [[Eagle Comics|Eagle]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Vortex Comics|Vortex]], [[New Media]], [[Fantagraphics]], [[Mirage Comics|Mirage]]) feared that having Pacific, a rival publisher, as their distributor could result in their being cut off from comic shops. This likely played a factor in the multiple alternate distributors who came into being to compete with Pacific, until nearly a quarter of Pacific's comic-shop accounts defected to alternate distributors in 1984, skipping out on paying Pacific for upwards of three months' worth of comic books.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

At the same time, Pacific and parent company Blue Dolphin Enterprises found themselves the target of lawsuits, including some dealing with foreign rights and royalties for Pacific-published creator-owned titles. In August 1984, with the company $740,000 in debt,&lt;ref name="SDBJ"&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/print/7448279.html "Comics publisher pins stellar hopes to ''Moonwalker''."] ''San Diego Business Journal'' (March 6, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; the Schaneses informed their staff that they would all be out of work by September.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Pacific Suspends Operations," ''The Comics Journal'' #93 (September 1984), pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steve Schanes, Pacific's publishing arm was still seeing profit at the time of the closure, but it was outweighed by the losses of the distribution arm, and he and his brother lacked the business expertise to sell off part of the business.&lt;ref name="DAK54"/&gt;

=== Liquidation ===
After the 1984 collapse of Pacific, many of its creator-owned publications moved to [[Eclipse Comics]]: Bruce Jones' ''[[Twisted Tales]]'', ''Alien Worlds'', and ''Somerset Holmes''; Dave Stevens' ''Rocketeer Special'' and a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] of [[Mark Evanier]]/[[Sergio Aragones]]' ''[[Groo the Wanderer]]''.

As Pacific went into liquidation in September 1984,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Pacific Comics liquidated," ''The Comics Journal'' #95 (February 1985), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Phil Seuling's distribution company [[Sea Gate Distributors]] also closed down. Pacific's distribution centers and warehouses were purchased by [[Bud Plant, Inc.]], and [[Capital City Distribution]], who also opened an expanded facility in Seagate's old space in Sparta, alongside the comic-book printing plant.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

Steve Schanes and his wife, Ann Fera, subsequently founded [[Blackthorne Publishing]],&lt;ref name="DAK54"/&gt; and Bill Schanes found employment with [[Diamond Comic Distributors]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2758">In the [[filmmaking]] industry, a '''pitch trailer''', also known as a '''Concept Trailer''' or '''Proof Of Concept Trailer''', is a [[movie trailer]] produced independently by the filmmaker for the sole purpose of illustrating the concept, style and theme of a [[feature film]]. Pitch trailers can be used by film directors, producers or executive producers during the film's planning, [[crowdfunding]] or fundraising phase. They are often self-financed and are structured and edited to appear like an ordinary feature film trailer. Pitch trailers are most commonly presented to financiers as a part of the film's [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]]. Sometimes, these trailers are used for [[casting]] purposes and marketing purposes as well.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Jonathan [http://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/8-great-proof-of-concept-films-that-got-picked-up-by-hollywood/ "8 Great ‘Proof of Concept’ Films That Got Picked Up by Hollywood"]  Premium Beat June 11, 2015.

The '''Radia tapes controversy''' relates to the telephonic conversations between [[Niira Radia|Nira Radia]], a political [[lobbyist]] in India, the (then) [[India]]n telecom minister [[A. Raja]], and senior journalists, politicians, and corporate houses,&lt;ref name="expressbuzzstir"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://expressbuzz.com/nation/radia-tapes-featuring-senior-scribes-create-stir/224516.html | title=Radia tapes featuring senior scribes create stir | publisher=Express Buzz | work=[[The Indian Express]] | date=20 November 2010 | accessdate=23 November 2010 | author=Gautam Datt}}&lt;/ref&gt; taped by the [[Indian Income Tax Department]] in 2008–09.

The revelations in the tapes led to accusations of misconduct by many of these people.

==Political lobbying==

According to the transcripts of the tapes, Radia lobbied against the reappointment of [[Dayanidhi Maran]] to the post of Union IT and Communications minister.

* Radia spoke with Barkha Dutt at 0948 IST.
Dutt: 'The stalemate (between Congress and DMK) continues, ya&lt;br/&gt;
Radia: 'my honest advice is that you tell them (Congress) that they need to tell him (Karunanidhi) directly ..&lt;br/&gt;
Dutt: 'OK, let me talk to them'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.outlookindia.com/view.aspx?vname=Barkha--18-188819-0-10-20090522-094851.wav |title=www.outlookindia.com &amp;#124; No. 3 Barkha Dutt: May 22, 2009 09:48:51 |publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook India]] |date= |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later conversation at 1047 IST, Barkha says that it (conveying the message to Congress) was 'not a problem' and that she would talk to Ghulam (Nabi Azad).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.outlookindia.com/view.aspx?vname=Barkha%20Dutt-02-188819-0-01-20090522-104733.wav |title=www.outlookindia.com &amp;#124; No. 7 Barkha Dutt: May 22, 2009 10:47:33 |publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook India]] |date= |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Radia, in a later conversation with Ranjan Bhattacharya, who also appears to be acting as a conduit to the Congress, mentions the above conversation, where she says, 'I made Barkha call up Congress, and get a statement from Congress whether the Prime Minister has actually said that he doesn't want Baalu, which she carried that he had never said it'. She also mentions to Bhattacharya, that 'your friend Sunil Mittal, has been lobbying against Raja (for Maran).'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.outlookindia.com/view.aspx?vname=Tarun%20Das-13-188819-0-07-20090522-165535.wav |title=www.outlookindia.com &amp;#124; No. 16 Ranjan Bhattacharya: May 22, 2009 16:55:35 |publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook India]] |date= |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests and developments==

Barkha Dutt, Vir Sanghvi, and others have refuted the allegations. M.K.Venu had filed a criminal defamation case against Outlook magazine for mentioning him on its cover. Outlook gave an unconditional apology in the court for mistakenly naming M.K.Venu and acknowledged his consistent writings against Telecom Minister A.Raja. News of the apology was published in Outlook, Indian Express and The Hindu.&lt;ref name=Tehelkafallout /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bhadas4media.com/article-comment/7449-2010-11-20-02-28-02.html Article by [[Amitabh Thakur]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newspostindia.com/2010-11-20-until-barkha-dutt-vir-sanghvi-resign-boycott-ndtv-hindustan-times Until Barkha Dutt, Vir Sanghvi resign, boycott NDTV &amp; Hindustan Times?]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Open Magazine'' maintained that the conversations were carried as they appeared in the recordings.&lt;ref name="openresponse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Open’s response to NDTV |url=http://openthemagazine.com/article/nation/open-s-response-to-ndtv|work=[[OPEN Magazine, India|OPEN Magazine]]|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutt defended her reputation through her Twitter account.

[[NDTV|New Delhi Television Limited]] posted a strong rebuttal on its website terming the insinuation that Barkha lobbied for A Raja as "unsubstantiated, baseless and defamatory" and threatened action against ''Open Magazine''.&lt;ref name="oneindia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Does media follow unethical, biased journalism?|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2010/11/21/does-media-follow-unethical-biased-journalism.html|work=[[Oneindia.in]]|accessdate=23 November 2010|date=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ndtvreply"&gt;{{cite web|title=NDTV on defamatory remarks against Barkha Dutt|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/ndtv-on-defamatory-remarks-against-barkha-dutt-67210|publisher=[[NDTV]]|accessdate=23 November 2010|date=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArabNews"&gt;{{cite web|title=og eating dog?|url=http://arabnews.com/economy/article197027.ece|publisher=[[ArabNews]]|accessdate=23 November 2010|date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nira Radia has served a legal notice on ''[[The Pioneer (Indian newspaper)|The Pioneer]]'', on the report titled "Tapped and Trapped" published by the newspaper. The notice asserted that ''The Pioneer''{{'}}s report regarding corruption and manipulation in the allotment of 2G spectrum to telecom operators, in so far as it referred to Radia's connections with Telecom Minister A Raja, are "absolutely false, baseless and malicious and constitute gross defamation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radia serves legal notice on Pioneer|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/252932/Radia-serves-legal-notice-on-Pioneer.html|publisher=[[The Pioneer (Indian newspaper)|The Pioneer]]|date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original tapes are now annexures in a [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] petition seeking Raja’s prosecution.

==Role of opposing political parties, business houses and lobbyists==
Subsequently, it was revealed that while true to their word, the Neera Radia tapes themselves had been leaked to the Indian media by a lobbyist belonging to a powerful business family, connected to other politicians and private companies. In 2016, in an interview with Hindustan times, [[Josy Joseph]], a highly respected Indian investigative journalist who had also received the tapes revealed that the Neera Radia tapes had been leaked to the Indian media, not by the government, but by a shource ensconced in a rival lobbying organization, to settle their own internal rivalries.&lt;ref name="Josy"&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview with Josy Joseph |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/watch-and-listen-josy-joseph-on-the-state-of-the-nation/story-fUrZznA9Sfm0TrNVifFiGO.html |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the tapes also contained statements by [[Ratan Tata]] stating that the tata group did not pay people under the table, but these segments were not run by media houses. Joseph wrote about these in his book ''[[A Feast of Vultures]]''.&lt;ref name="vultures"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joseph |first1=Josy |title= A Feast of Vultures: The Hidden Business of Democracy in India|date=15 July 2016 |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn= 9350297515 |url= https://www.afeastofvultures.com |accessdate= 25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relative pitch''' is the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given [[musical note]] by comparing it to a reference note and identifying the interval between those two notes. Relative pitch implies some or all of the following abilities:
* Determine the distance of a musical note from a set point of reference, e.g. "three [[octave]]s above [[middle C]]"
* Identify the intervals between given tones, regardless of their relation to [[concert pitch]] (A = 440&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* the skill used by singers to correctly sing a melody, following [[musical notation]], by pitching each note in the melody according to its distance from the previous note.  Alternatively, the same skill which allows someone to hear a melody for the first time and name the notes relative to some known [[Ear training#Functional pitch recognition|reference pitch]].

This last definition, which applies not only to singers but also to players of instruments who rely on their own skill to determine the precise pitch of the notes played (wind instruments, fretless string instruments like violin or viola, etc.), is an essential skill for musicians in order to play successfully with others. As an example, think of the different [[concert pitch]]es used by orchestras playing music from different styles (a baroque orchestra using [[Historically informed performance|period instruments]] might decide to use a higher-tuned pitch).

Unlike [[absolute pitch]] (sometimes called "perfect pitch"), relative pitch is quite common among musicians, especially musicians who are used to "playing by ear", and a precise relative pitch is a constant characteristic among good musicians. Unlike perfect pitch, relative pitch can be developed through [[ear training]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, Lee. [http://www.thinkingapplied.com/sight-singing_folder/sight-singing.pdf ''Learning to Sight-Sing: The Mental Mechanics of Aural Imagery.''] Minneapolis: Thinking Applied, 2008, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-aided ear training is becoming a popular tool for musicians and music students, and various software is available for improving relative pitch.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some music teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate each possible interval with the first two notes of a popular song. (See [[ear training]].) Another method of developing relative pitch is playing melodies by ear on a musical instrument, especially one which, unlike a piano or other fingered instrument, requires a specific manual adjustment for each particular tone.  Indian musicians learn relative pitch by singing intervals over a [[drone (music)|drone]], which is also described by [[W. A. Mathieu]]{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} using Western [[just intonation]] terminology. Many Western ear training classes use [[solfège]] to teach students relative pitch, while others use [[numerical sight-singing]].

Compound intervals (intervals greater than an octave) can be more difficult to detect than simple intervals (intervals less than an octave).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Interval recognition is used to identify chords, and can be applied to accurately tune an instrument with respect to a given reference tone, even if the tone is not in [[concert pitch]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Rick Berry''' (born June 2, 1953) is a contemporary American expressionistic figure artist based in the [[Boston]] area.  Berry creates art for galleries, illustration, and paintings for theatrical performances.&lt;ref name="Berry"&gt;{{citation |last=Laskowski|first=Nicole |url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/arlington/news/x2114543289/Arlingtons-Rick-Berry-is-a-child-scribbler-at-heart |title= Arlington's Rick Berry is a 'child scribbler' at heart |newspaper=Arlington Advocate |date=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Berry's work has appeared in many science fiction, fantasy and [[comic books]], including [[Neil Gaiman]]'s Sandman, [[Magic: The Gathering]] cards, and [[Stephen King]] novels. In 1985, Berry created the first digitally painted book cover worldwide for [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]''.&lt;ref name="Berry"/&gt;

==Early life==
Berry was born in [[San Bernardino, California]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; His father, an air force fighter pilot, was frequently stationed in China. Berry's childhood home was populated with Asian art which fascinated Berry and later found its way into his works.&lt;ref name="Berry" /&gt;

Frequently moving in his youth, he left behind friends, homes and communities, but he never let go of art. Self-taught, drawing was the constant in his life. He learned from comics, book covers,and anything available from the streets. At 17 while living in Colorado, Berry left school and home, hitchhiking across the country.  His art career started around that time in underground comics, as a founding member of Everyman Studios in Colorado.[http://artie.com/everyman.htm].&lt;ref name="Berry"/&gt; His first commissioned painting for the book industry was a cover for [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea]]'', published by Simon and Schuster, 1978.&lt;ref name="Berry" /&gt;

==Early Computer Art==
An innovator in new media during the early 1980s,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Berry is credited with the first digitally painted book cover, in his cover for the cyberpunk novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'', by [[William Gibson]]. Published in 1985, this cover was commissioned when it became clear that ''Neuromancer'' would sweep the awards after its initial publication in 1984 and remained the novel's cover for almost two decades. Berry created the painting with assistance from hackers at MIT's Machine Architectural Group.&lt;ref name="Parnell"&gt;{{Citation |last=Parnell |first=Helene |title=Illustration and the Dawn of the Digital Revolution |type = Master's Thesis|publisher = Marywood University, Scranton, PA.  | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neuromancer_Digital_Book_Cover.jpg|thumb|right|First digitally painted book cover for Neuromancer.]]

Like William Gibson,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Elmer-Dewitt|first=Philip|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,977654,00.html|title=Cyberpunk!|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 8, 1993|accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry purchased his first computer from the proceeds of Neuromancer.  He immediately began experimenting with it as a groundbreaking new creative tool, not to mimic techniques of traditional media.&lt;ref name="Parnell"/&gt;

Berry again worked with William Gibson and director [[Robert Longo]] for SonyPictures’ ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]''. The team of Rick Berry, Darrel Anderson and Gene Bodio employed state-of-the-art tech advances to design and produce the CGI cyberspace climax - the award-winning sequence featured in [[SIGGRAPH]]'s animation revue, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkecho.com/darkecho/web/about.html "Featured Art by Rick Berry"]. DarkEcho (darkecho.com).&lt;/ref&gt;
Berry was also [[Keanu Reeves]]’ cyberspace stunt double in Johnny Mnemonic.&lt;ref name="Berry" /&gt;

==Collaborations in Italy==
In 2010, Rick Berry and frequent collaborator, [[Phil Hale]], were the subject of the museum exhibition "Parallel Evolutions" at Lucca Center for Contemporary Art, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmzero.com/portfolio/parallel-evolutions "Parallel Evolutions"]. Studio Kmzero (kmzero.com).&lt;/ref&gt; "'' ...two artists who are emblematic of the fluid, shifting nature of contemporary art."'' —Cosimo Lorenzo Pancini &amp; Emanuele Vietina, Co-Curators. The exhibition coincided with the annual Lucca Comics and Games Festival attracting 140,000 attendees. Berry and Hale were honored guests at this festival twice, 1998 and again in 2010.

"Parallel Evolutions" concluded with a special art event—Berry and Hale collaborating before a packed audience at the museum. These paintings sold during the festival in the charity auction for the local children's hospital. A decade earlier, Berry had designed the festival’s now ongoing live collaborative performance site featuring international artists working together for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Berry was first introduced to Hale when Phil approached Berry as a teenager interested in acquiring art instruction and they continue a lifelong association.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In the early 90s artist [[Jeffrey Catherine Jones]] said of Berry and Hale -
''"It is remarkable ... that somehow out of the "discontinuities of the unexpected universe" two of the most creative artists and best draftsmen I've ever seen should met at the right time."'' -- Jeff Jones commenting on Double Memory the book of art by Berry and Hale.

==Connection with Tufts University==
Berry was commissioned to create several solo exhibitions at Tufts University for their [Institute of Global Leadership].&lt;ref&gt;http://tiglarchives.org/programs/inspire/past-practicionersscholars&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of topics Berry explored include human trafficking, conflict resolution over limited resources, the politics of fear, and the advancing globalization of China. During 2005-06 Berry was Practitioner in Residence for Tufts INSPIRE program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tuftsgloballeadership.org&lt;/ref&gt;
Of works created for these international symposia, Rick states “These paintings serve as meditation upon events almost too overwhelming to contemplate. Seeing with art, it becomes possible to move toward the problems considered, rather than run from them” &lt;ref&gt;Oil &amp; Water Program, 2005, Education for Public Inquiry and International Citizenship, Institute for Global Leadership, Tufts University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera and theatre==
Berry was invited to participate in the first visual art residency offered by [[Opera Boston]], a company known for innovative repertoire choices.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The two-season collaboration seemed a natural partnership as soon as it began with Shostakovich's surreal opera ''[[The Nose (opera)]]''. "Rick Berry,...was embedded in the rehearsals" (BostonMetro Feb 27, 2009) where he sketched performers in the dark. Back in the studio, Berry would put aside these small sketches and without photography or models, he relied upon his unique process of discovery in the paint and his memory, to evolve large scale works for gallery exhibitions. Berry brought this technique to live theater in his 2010 collaboration with Amanda Palmer and the [[American Repertory Theater]].

===Amanda Palmer and ''Cabaret''===
In 2010, [[Amanda Palmer]] invited Berry to engage in her upcoming production of ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' at the [[American Repertory Theater]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Once again, he employed his process of rapid ink drawing while embedded in rehearsals, later producing large expressive oil paintings as a part of the café theater set. Influenced by the intensity of the story, performers, and Butoh movement in this production, Berry created works that were "like images of ghosts projected on smoke and ash. Just at the moment you think you've resolved them, they shimmer and erode before your eyes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://windling.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/for-those-of-you-in-new-england.html Butoh and Paint, Smoke and Ash], [[Terri Windling]], October 14, 2010, retrieved 2012-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Berry was awarded the Silver Medal from the [[Society of Illustrators]] for his painting "To Absent Friends" in this series.&lt;ref name="si53"&gt;{{citation|title=53rd Annual of American Illustration|publisher=[[Society of Illustrators]]|year=2012|page=217}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berry's next collaboration with Amanda Palmer was as one of several artists selected to paint images influenced by her new songs. Two Berry paintings are included in her 2012–13 world tour gallery and art book.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Amanda|last=Palmer|authorlink=Amanda Palmer|title=The Grand Theft Art Companion|year=2012}}.&lt;!-- the book has no page numbers or ISBN but Berry's art is approximately 1/3 of the way through, with an artist bio at the back of the book --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thalia.jpg|thumb|[[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]], the muse of acting. The model is presumed to be Silvia Balletti]]
'''Zanetta Rosa Benozzi Balletti''' ([[Toulouse]], 27 June 1701 – 16 September 1758), known under her stage name '''Silvia Balletti''', was an Italian actress. She was active at the ''Troupe de Regente'' of [[Luigi Riccoboni]] at the [[Comédie-Italienne]] in Paris 1716–1758.
She was the star of the [[Comédie-Italienne|Italian theatre]] in Paris and regarded as a superior interpreter of the plays by [[Pierre de Marivaux]]. She mainly played the part of heroine in [[Commedia dell'arte]], ''Silvia''. [[Casanova]] belonged to her admirers.

==Life==
Silvia Balletti was born to the Italian actors Giuseppe Tortoriti (Pascariello), Antonio Benozzi and Clara Mascara, who belonged to a Venetian theatre company active in Toulouse since the banishment of the Comédie Italienne from Paris in 1697. In 1716, she belonged to the first actors engaged when the Comedie Italienne was reestablished in Paris. Her career up to that point is not known, but it is presumed that she must have had experience, since she would not otherwise have been hired to take part in the opening performance before the regent of 18 May 1716. She made a success, and became the theater's star in heroine parts.

In 1720, she began a long co-operation with [[Pierre de Marivaux]], who wrote numerous plays for her in which she celebrated triumphs on stage. Among her celebrated parts were the main parts i ''Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard'' (1730),  ''L'amante difficile'' (1731), ''Le Je ne sais quoi'' (1731), ''L'École des mères'' (1732), ''Arlequin apprenti philosophe'' (1733). Until his death in 1739, she mainly acted opposite [[Tommaso Visentini]], thereafter opposite [[Antonio Costantini]]. Though she eventually replaced the parts as heroine for mother-roles, she remained one of the most celebrated actors of Paris until her retirement, and was in 1754 still referred to as a renowned perfect actor.  
Silvia Balletti retired in February 1758, shortly before her death.

In 1720, she married her cousin Giuseppe Balletti, who was her co-actor in hero-parts. In 1750, she met [[Casanova]], who was the friend of her son Antonio Stefano Balletti and courted her daughter Manon.

[[File:SFDLogo.svg|thumb|250px|right|Software Freedom Day logo]]
'''Software Freedom Day''' ('''SFD''') is an annual worldwide celebration of [[Free Software]] organized by [[Digital Freedom Foundation]]. SFD is a public education effort with the aim of [[awareness raising|increasing awareness]] of Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use.

SFD was established in 2004 and was first observed on 28 August of that year. About 12 teams participated in the first Software Freedom Day. Since that time it has grown in popularity and while organisers anticipated more than 1,000 teams in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://fred.dao2.com/sfd-work-update/ Fred Muller's blog] (President of Software Freedom International)&lt;/ref&gt; the event has stalled at around 400+ locations over the past two years, representing a 30% decrease over 2009.

Since 2006 Software Freedom Day has been held on the third Saturday of September, it has occasionally coincided with [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day]].

[[File:Wikimedia_Philippines_at_the_Software_Freedom_Day_2011.jpg|thumb|Students lined up to register at the Software Freedom Day 2011 event in the University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines]]

== Organization ==

Each event is left to local teams around the world to organize. Pre-registered teams (2 months before the date or earlier) receive free [[promotional item|schwag]] sent by SFI to help with the events themselves. The [http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org SFD wiki] contains individual team pages describing their plans as well as helpful information to get them up to speed. Events themselves varies between conferences explaining the virtues of Free and Open Source Software, to workshops, demonstrations, games, planting tree ceremonies, discussions and [[Linux User Group#Installfests|InstallFests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/StartGuide#What_should_we_do.3F SFD Startup Guide (What should we do)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note on the figures above: it is difficult to find figures of the early years and even more find sources. The maps on the SFD website are only reliable after 2007, however some years such as 2009 saw extra teams from two different sources which didn't "officially" register with SFI. There was about 80 teams from China and a hundred from the Sun community (OSUM) who heavily subsidized goodies for their teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.java-virtual-machine.net/5064.html Mirrored SUN PR announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early year of SFD the map was an optional component not connected with the registration script and therefore some teams didn't go through the troubles of adding themselves.

== Sponsors ==

The primary sponsor from the start was [[Canonical Ltd.]], the company behind [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], a [[Linux distribution]]. Then [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[DKUUG]], [[Google]], [[Red Hat]], [[Linode]], [[Nokia]] and now [[MakerBot Industries]] have joined the supporting organisations as well as the [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] and the [[FSFE]]. [[IBM]] and [[Sun Microsystems]] are currently not sponsoring the event. In terms of media coverage SFI is partnering with [[Linux Magazine]], [[Linux Journal]] and [[Ubuntu User]]. Each local team can seek sponsors independently, especially local FOSS supporting organisations and often appears in local medias such as newspapers and TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/en/sfd/press-coverage Press coverage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918055242/http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/en/sfd/press-coverage |date=18 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo3|"mishearing; (feigned) deafness", literally "air ear"|空耳|'''Soramimi'''}} or {{nihongo3|"misheard lyrics"|空耳歌詞|'''soramimi kashi'''}};{{efn|{{lang|ja|空}} means "empty" (as in ''[[karate]]'') when read ''kara''. But here, it is read ''sora'', translating as "sky", "heaven", "air".}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for [[homophonic translation]] of [[song lyrics]], that is, interpreting lyrics in one language as similar-sounding lyrics in another language. A bilingual ''soramimi'' [[word play]] contrasts with a monolingual [[mondegreen]] or [[homophonic transformation]], and is usually caused by [[pareidolia]]. ''Soramimi'' transcription is also commonly used in [[animutation]]s for comic effect.

An example is the [[Moldova]]n band [[O-Zone]]'s song "[[Dragostea Din Tei]]", known on the web as the [[Numa Numa (video)|Numa Numa]] song. The refrain of the original song (in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) is:
: {{lang|ro|Vrei să pleci dar nu mă, nu mă iei...}}
: ("You want to leave but you don't want, don't want to take me...")

A ''soramimi'' version, from the Japanese [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animation ''Maiyahi'', translates these words as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lucas|first=Dean|title=Famous Pictures Magazine - Numa Numa|url=http://www.famouspictures.org/numa-numa/|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This video can be found at http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/maiyahi. Its explanation: http://www.mimo-jp.com/japan/maiyahi.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This particular ''soramimi'' video featured an animated version of the popular [[Shift JIS art]] cat [[Monā]], and inspired [[Gary Brolsma]], whose own video sparked the Numa Numa phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newnuma.com/story.html|title=Gary Brolsma &amp; The Numa Story|accessdate=2007-07-03|work=Gary Brolsma &amp; New Numa! }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
: {{lang|ja|米さ！米酒だろう！飲ま飲まイェイ！}}
: ''Bei sa! Beishu darou! nomanoma-iei!''
: ("Rice, obviously! Rice wine, most likely! Drink drink yay!")

==Examples==

===Japanese===
* Japanese [[comedian]] [[Tamori]] has had a long-running "Soramimi Hour" segment on his TV program ''[[Tamori Club]]'', where he and his co-host watch mini-skits based on ''soramimi kashi'' submitted by the audience.

===English (''Mondegreen'')===
* Mike Sutton, a [[mondegreen]] director on [[YouTube]] with the screen name "Buffalax", has uploaded several non-English music videos edited to include subtitles of the written English approximation of the video's original language's sound. "Benny Lava", Sutton's subtitling of the video for [[Prabhu Deva]]'s song "Kalluri Vaanil" from the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil movie]] ''[[Pennin Manathai Thottu]]'', received considerable praise.&lt;ref&gt;"My Loony Bun Is Fine, Benny Lava: The web's hottest clip", ''The Toronto Sun'', April 28, 2008, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the terms ''Buffalaxed'' and ''Benny Lava'' are now synonymous with ''mondegreens'', "words or phrases misheard in ways that yield new meanings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Monty Phan |title=Buffalax Mines Twisted Translations for YouTube Yuks |url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/news/2007/11/buffalax |publisher=''[[Wired News]]'' |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2008-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428193559/http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/news/2007/11/buffalax |archivedate=April 28, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nu.nl/column/1625533/spreekt-johan-cruijff-arabisch.html Spreekt Johan Cruijff Arabisch?] on [[Nu.nl]]&lt;/ref&gt; Buffalax's account was closed in early 2011 for copyright violation complaints, and the videos (including those that were not copyright violations) were all deleted. However, his videos have been remade and cleaned up—often replacing the sound and/or video with better copies—and re-uploaded by other users.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
* The Dutch song "Opblaaskrokodil" by [[Ome Henk]] has been turned into an [[animutation]] called ''The French Erotic Film'', where the word ''Opblaaskrokodil'' becomes ''Old blue Scot called Dil''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Russian===
* The Palestinian patriotic song "''Blādi, blādi''" ("Motherland, Motherland") was intentionally "misheard" into [[Russian language|Russian]] as {{lang|ru|sc=Latn|blyadi, blyadi}} (= "[[Prostitution|whore]]s, whores") and uploaded to YouTube with Russian subtitles. The resulting video became an instant hit on Russian-language websites and blogs with more than 2 million views, and a number of phrases from the Russian version (especially "No money, long bumblebee") became instant catchphrases. Below is the example of the chorus:

:Whores, whores, whores...
|}
:{{small|Note that ''blādi'' in the original is dialect for [[standard Arabic]] ''bilādī'' {{lang|ar|بِلَادِي}} "my country".}}

* In another instance, a Russian-language cover of "[[Tic, Tic Tac|Tic Tic Tac]]", a popular [[Soca music|soca]]/disco hit by Carrapicho, phonetically rendered the first phrase of the chorus, {{lang|pt|Bate forte o tambor}} ({{langnf||Portuguese|"beat the drum hard"}}), as {{lang|ru|Мальчик хочет в Тамбов}} (''Malchik Khochet v Tambov'', "A boy wants to go to [[Tambov]]").
* In the 1976 [[Boney M]] hit [[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]], the chorus "What about it Daddy Cool?" was heard by many Russians as {{lang|ru|Варвара жарит кур}}(''Varvara zharit kur'', "Barbara is frying chicken").
* The song "[[What Can I Do (Smokie song)|What Can I Do]]" by [[Smokie (band)|Smokie]] from their 1976 ''[[Midnight Café]]'' album became an instant hit in the [[USSR]] because many Russians heard the song's title line as {{lang|ru|Водку найду}} (''Vodku naydu'', "I shall find some vodka").

===German (''Agathe Bauer'')===
* In German popular culture, Mondegreens are often called ''Agathe Bauer Songs''. This comes from the [[Snap!]] song "[[The Power (Snap! song)|The Power]]", the refrain of which ("I've got the power") sounds like the [[German language|German]] name ''Agathe Bauer''. German radio station [[104.6 RTL|RTL 104.6]] runs a segment where listeners call in with their own Agathe Bauer songs, which are played on-air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.104.6rtl.com/comedy/agathe-bauer-songs/cyndi-lauper-girls-just-want-to-have-fun |title=Agathe Bauer Songs: Cyndi Lauper - Girls Just Want To Have Fun &amp;#124; 104.6 RTL Comedy |publisher=104.6rtl.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112120428/http://www.104.6rtl.com/comedy/agathe-bauer-songs/cyndi-lauper-girls-just-want-to-have-fun |archivedate=2014-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another German term for ''soramimi'' is {{lang|de|Verhörer}}.

===Dutch (''Mama Appelsap'')===
* In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the act of finding misheard lyrics in songs is sometimes referred to as {{lang|nl|Mama Appelsap}} (literally "momma applejuice"), referring to the song "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]" by Michael Jackson. The chant "Mama-se mama-sa ma-ma-coo-sa" (Jackson's imitation of [[Soul Makossa]] by [[Manu Dibango]]) can appear by Dutch speakers as if it sounds like "Mama say mama sa mama appelsap". The item became a running joke on national radio station [[3FM]], when DJ Timur Perlin hosted a program titled ''Mama Appelsap'', whereby listeners suggest various Dutch phrases and sentences purported to have been heard in songs.

===Danish (''Undersættelse'')===
* In [[Danish language|Danish]], where the word "translation" is {{lang|da|oversættelse}} (literally "over-setting"), such a lyrical mistake is called an under-setting ({{lang|da|undersættelse}}). Danish artist [[Benny Vigan Madsen]] has made a number of illustrated ''soramimi'' clips of national anthems, the most popular of which is the Red Army Choir's version of the USSR anthem, where the final line ''Nas k torzhestvu kommunizma vedyot'' ("It leads us to the triumph of Communism") becomes {{lang|da|Pasta med sprut. Nå, kunne vi sparke en røv?}} ("Pasta with booze. So could we kick an ass?")

===Hebrew (''Timlulim'')===
* In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the act of finding misheard lyrics in songs is known as ''timlul'' (literally "transcript"). ''Soramimi'' clips in [[Israel]] were almost exclusively the work of amateurs publishing their work on the internet, and were popular mainly during the mid-[[2000s (decade)|2000s]], with the most transcribed musical group being [[Era (musical project)|Era]]. For instance, in one such transcript of the song "Hymne", the opening line ''In tu pate del cat'' becomes ''Timtum al emet ratz'' ("Stupidity for real runs"); ''I manitores solitudi me'' becomes ''Ima, likro le Soli-Dolittle?'' ("Mom, should I go call Soli-Dolittle?", with Soli ostensibly being a relative of [[Dr. Dolittle]]); and the repeated ''Senzo'' is misheard as ''[[Samsung]]'', which led to the piece being dubbed "the Samsung [[Cantata]]" ({{lang|he|הקנטטה של סמסונג}}). Another ''soramimi'' flash clip of an Era piece was based on "[[Ameno (song)|Ameno]]", where ''Dorime'' became ''Dori met'' ({{lang|he|דורי מת}}, "Dori is dead").
* In addition to the Era videos, there were a few others that became well-known. These included a transcript of "[[Dragostea Din Tei]]" that interpreted the song's repeated ''Maya''s as a reference to [[Maya Buskila]] (with accompanying visuals), and a transcript of "[[Adiemus (song)|Adiemus]]" where "a-ya doo a-ye" became ''haYagur ra'ev'' ("the Yagur is hungry"; ''yagur'' is not actually a word, but phonetic and linguistic cues heavily suggest that it is supposed to be some kind of bird).
* The popular 1978 [[Eurovision]] song of "[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]", with the first line of the chorus as ''a-ba-ni-bi-o-bo-he-bev'', has also been dubbed into English as "I want to be a polar bear" on YouTube.

===Italian (''Canzoni travisate'')===
* In [[Italy]], the art of taking an Indian (or any other non-Italian) music video and giving it subtitles for what it sounds like in [[Italian language|Italian]], became popular between YouTube users. One of the songs that have been most successful is the ''soramimi'' version of "Pariya" by [[Shahram Shabpareh]], called in Italy {{lang|it|Esce ma non mi rosica}} ("She goes out, but she doesn't bother me"). The comedians [[Trio Medusa]] regularly perform radio sketches regarding {{lang|it|canzoni travisate}} ("misinterpreted songs") using mostly English-language songs. The Disco-Hit "[[Funkytown]]" by [[Lipps Inc.]] generated some urban legends regarding its lyrics: "Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me" misinterpreted in Italian as {{lang|it|Caro amico mio, culattone, aspettami}} ("Dear friend of mine, homo, wait for me").

===Swedish (''Turkhits'')===
In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''soramimi'' are colloquially known as {{lang|sv|turkhits}} ("Turkish Hits"). The name became popular mainly because of a series of flash videos in the early 2000s which featured Eastern European and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] songs with the phonetic Swedish lyrics superimposed on top. Though mondegreens have some previous history in Sweden this name has persisted, likely as a consequence of the most popular ''turkhits'' commonly being derived from Pop or Rock songs in Turkic languages and close relatives within the same language family. This is likely because the language group shares some vowel sounds and stress characteristics with the modern Scandinavian, and while Turkish, unlike Swedish, is not a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal language]], its vowel harmonic qualities sometimes contribute to creating remarkable similarities in pronunciation, thus facilitating the aural pareidolia. 
* Popular ''turkhits''{{efn|Most of these are not actually in Turkish.}} include ''[[Hatten är din]]'' ("The hat is yours", from Arabic "''Habbeetek''", "I Fell In Love With You"), {{Interlanguage link|Ansiktsburk|lt=''Ansiktsburk''|sv}} ("Face can", from Arabic "''Am tekbar el farha''", "joy grows"), {{ill|Fiskpinnar|lt=''Fiskpinnar''|sv}} ("Fish sticks"), and a version of the [[Soviet National Anthem]] whose "translation" of the refrain ''Nas k torzhestvu Kommunizma vedyot'' ("We see the triumph of Communism") is rendered into {{lang|sv|Hasch fanns I spruta; polis sprang i lag}} ("[there was] hashish in a syringe; police ran in teams"). 
* More recent iterations include {{ill|Dålig Mat|lt=''Dålig Mat''|sv}} ("Bad Food"), a Swedish interpretation of the previously spoofed song "Golimar" ({{langnf||Telugu|"Shoot the Bullet"}}), the main musical number from the movie ''[[Donga (film)|Donga]]'' (itself arguably a parody on [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]"); a rendition of [[Tarkan (singer)|Tarkan Tevetoğlu's]] 1997 hit "[[Şımarık]]" from the album [[Ölürüm Sana]] titled {{lang|sv|Jesper é {{wiktswe|neger}}}} ("Jesper is a [[nigger]]" &lt;!-- The word ''Neger'' is considered insulting in Swedish. See the Wiktionary link on "Neger" --&gt;); and forays into [[death metal|death]] and [[black metal]] songs that include such titles as 
"Rostburk" ("Rust can") and "SM i Pistol och Valross" ("National Championships in Pistol and Walrus").

===Mandarin Chinese===
There have been [[:zh:空耳|various parodies]] done by Chinese netizens for foreign language songs. These are usually referred to as ''yinyi'' ({{lang-zh|s=音译|t=音譯|p=yīnyì}}; meaning: transliteration) or ''konger'' ({{lang-zh|c=空耳|p=kōngěr|labels=no}}; a direct Japanese loanword of ''soramimi'').

*The 1998 [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] hit "[[Tunak Tunak Tun]]" was subjected to a Chinese transliteration parody, as its chorus {{lang|pa|ਤੁਨਕ ਤੁਨਕ ਤੁਨ ਦਾ ਦਾ ਦਾ}} (''Tunak tunak tun dadada'') sounded similar to {{lang|zh|多冷的隆冬，淡淡的}} (lit. "O the freezing cold of winter, how pale it feels") or {{lang|zh|嘟嚕嘟嚕嘟大大大}} (onomatopoeic), while a sentence in the first verse {{lang|pa|ਧੋਲਣਾ ਵਜੇ ਤੁਮਬੇ ਵਲ ਤਾਰ}} (''Dholna vaje tumbe val taar'') was close to {{lang|zh|多冷啊,我在东北玩泥巴}} (lit. "It's freezing cold, I'm playing with dirt in the Northeast").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/hhJ8ssELVvg/ |title=暴强！当印度歌曲配上东北话字幕 多冷的隆冬 |publisher=Wishydig.blogspot.com |date=2009-07-12 |accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjz2c7YKEg0 印度F4 (字幕版) - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1993 [[North Korea]]n patriotic song "[[No Motherland Without You]]" became infamously dubbed as "{{lang|zh|金囧日偷鸡}}" (lit. "[[Kim Jong-il]] does the bluff" / "Kim Jong-il steals chickens"), following the Mandarin transliteration of one of its lyrics ({{lang|ko|김정일동지}} / {{lang|ko|金正日同志}}, "Comrade Kim Jong-il").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqhWbtIieLk |title=金正日偷鸡 |publisher=youtube.com |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2009, Taiwanese netizens dubbed [[Super Junior]]'s "[[Sorry, Sorry (Super Junior song)|Sorry Sorry]]" with Chinese misheard lyrics, including a controversial transliteration of "Sorry {{lang|ko|네게 빠져 버려}} baby" (lit. "Sorry, I have fallen in love with you") into "{{lang|zh|手裡 那根 芭蕉 爆了}} baby" (lit. "The ''banana'' in my hand has exploded"). The dubbed video quickly went viral on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/dramaandtheatre/documents/pdf/platform/51/sorrysorry51.pdf |title=From ‘Sorry Sorry' to ‘That Banana': the Subtitling of a Korean Music Video as a Site of Contestation in Taiwan |author=Chih-Chieh Liu  |accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 2012 South Korean hit "[[Gangnam Style]]" has its prominent catchphrase ''Oppa Gangnam Style'' transliterated as {{lang|zh|我爸刚弄死他}} (lit. "My father just murdered him").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.xuite.net/jordan41018/blog/63132740-%7B%E9%9F%B3%E6%A8%82%7D+PSY-Gangnam+Style+%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%A9%BA%E8%80%B3+%2B+%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87+%E6%AD%8C%E8%A9%9E%28%E5%85%A7%E6%96%B0%E5%A2%9EOrange+style%29 |title={音樂} PSY-Gangnam Style 中文空耳 + 中文 歌詞(內新增Orange style) |accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a joke based on Michael Jackson's "[[Beat It (song)|Beat It]]" which goes:
*: {{lang|zh|哪一個偶像最喜歡說"筆勒"?}}
*: ''nǎyígè ǒuxiàng zuì xǐhuān shuō "bǐlēi"?''
*: Which idol most likes to say "got a pen?" (literal) / Which pop star always asks for a pen? (translated)
*:: Answer: Michael Jackson. "Beat it!" sounds like the Chinese for "got a pen?"

===Other examples===
* A number of ''soramimi'' videos were made for [[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]], juxtaposing the music with images appropriate to the misheard lyrics, for example showing four cans of tuna for "O Fortuna".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wishydig.blogspot.com/2009/10/windmill-cookies-theyll-give-you.html |title=Wishydig |publisher=Wishydig.blogspot.com |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Romania]], the children's song "Pula Pula" ("Jump Jump"), by Brazilian gospel singer [[Aline Barros]] became a sensation, getting airplay on major radio stations and spawning several YouTube parody videos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-KTaKCyKe8 |title=Pula-pula-pula Romanian subtitles |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Romanian language|Romanian]] soramimi lyrics, as {{lang|ro|pula}} means "penis" in Romanian and it is heavily repeated in the chorus.
* In [[Poland]], "Decade of Therion", a 1999 song by death metal band [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]], became a popular Internet meme when given soramimi lyrics. The English phrase "We transgress the context of commonplaceness" has been interpreted in Polish as {{lang|pl|Łyżwiarz wie, że kotek odkopał prezent}} ("The ice-skater knows that the pussycat has dug up the present").
* In [[Serbo-Croatian]], the title of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s song "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]" is often deliberately misinterpreted as {{lang|sh|A Radovan baca daske}}, meaning "and Radovan (a male name) is throwing the planks". Similarly, [[The Police]] song "[[Message in a Bottle (song)|Message in a Bottle]]" is interpreted as {{lang|sh|mesečina, bato}} ("moonlight, o brother"). Spanish-language song "[[Sopa de Caracol]]" can be entirely reinterpreted as erotic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=bramanko|title=Meksicki Gidra - Vatanje u kolcu (ORIGINAL)|date=2012-03-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUJhcJ1L5Tk|accessdate=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Brazil]] there are loads of ''soramimi'' involving [[Cinema of India|Indian film music]], mainly with [[Prabhu Deva]] acting, including [[Kalluri Vaanil]] from [[Benny Lava]] fame (known in Brazil as ''Vai [[Rivaldo]]'', referring the famous soccer player, captain of 2002 [[Brazil national football team]] on [[2002 FIFA World Cup|Japan and Korea]]). Also a very popular one is "[[Tunak Tunak Tun]]", called in Brazil {{lang|pt|Tônico com Guaraná}} ("Tonic with Soda").
* The chorus of the [[Las Ketchup]] song "[[The Ketchup Song|Aserejé]]" is an [[Andalusian Spanish]] phonetic rendering of the English-language song "[[Rapper's Delight]]" by [[The Sugarhill Gang]].
* In 80s [[Hungary]], the chorus of the Opus song "[[Live is Life]]" ("La ba dab dab dab life") was often misheard for {{lang|hu|Levelet kaptam, Life}} (literally meaning "I have received a letter, Life").
* In [[France]], a popular occurrence of misheard lyrics is found in the [[Metallica]] song "[[The Unforgiven (song)|The Unforgiven]]". The original lyrics go: "New blood joins this earth // And quickly he's subdued" which is misheard in French as: {{lang|fr|Nous battons des œufs // Et pouic ! pouic ! ils se tournent}} ("we whisk eggs, and kwik! kwik! they turn"). [[Les Bidochons]] is a band that sings in French songs by English-language bands with similar-sounding lyrics. They started with songs from the [[Sex Pistols]] but also covered the [[Rolling Stones]] and the [[Beatles]]. Many of these have been gathered by [[Serge Llado]] in the so-called "Hallucinations auditives".&lt;ref&gt;the video can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YbT1xc_p6A&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Hong Kong]], a frequently broadcast Vietnamese radio [[public service announcement]] on [[Radio Television Hong Kong]] during the late 1980s and early 1990s included a Vietnamese phrase starting with {{lang|vi|Bắt đầu từ nay}}, which was deliberately misinterpreted as {{lang|zh|不漏洞}}拉" or {{lang|zh|北漏洞拉}} ([[Cantonese]] ''[[Bat lau dung laai]]'' or ''Bak lau dung laai'', "beginning from now") and became famous in popular culture.
* After [[North Korea]] successfully launched [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2]] satellite in 2012, the KCTV news report have been dubbed by Chinese netizens, where {{lang|ko|평안북도 철산군 서해위성발사장에서}} (lit. "In Sohae Satellite Launching Ground, Cholsan County, North Pyongan Province") is transliterated as {{lang|zh|穷也不能穷山东, 初音一葱拍死了张根硕}} (lit. "Cannot allow [[Shandong]] to be poor, [[Hatsune Miku|Hatsune]] killed [[Jang Keun-suk]] under one strike with bunching onion").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALzAKYcGj60|title=【神级空耳】朝鲜播音员大妈，穷也不能穷山东！ - YouTube|accessdate=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bilibili.com/video/av9780552/|title=【穷也不能穷山东】朝鲜电视台女播音员空耳播报_搞笑_生活_bilibili_哔哩哔哩|accessdate=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stralsund Theatre''' ('''{{lang-de|Stralsunder Theater}}''') in the German town of [[Stralsund]] has a long tradition. Performances of theatre pieces on the ''[[Alter Markt (Stralsund)|Alter Markt]]'' are documented in the years 1553 (''"Tragedie van deme Daniel"'') and 1584 (''"De Tragedien van Susannen"''). The present building was designed by [[Carl Moritz (architect)|Carl Moritz]] and opened in 1914. The tradition has continued since the merger of the  theatres of the towns of Stralsund and Greifswald in 1994 into the [[Theatre of West Pomerania]] (''{{lang|de|Theater Vorpommern}}'').

[[Image:Portion of the plaques at TX Country Music Hall of Fame in Carthage IMG_8480.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Some of the plaques of the inductees into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]]

The '''Texas Country Music [[Hall of Fame]]''', formerly the '''Tex Ritter Museum''', located in [[Carthage, Texas|Carthage]] in [[Panola County, Texas|Panola County]] in [[East Texas]], honors those who have made outstanding contributions to [[country music]] and were born in the state of [[Texas]]. This includes [[singer]]s, [[songwriter]]s, [[disc jockey]]s, and others.

A [[museum]], a large multi-purpose room, and a gift shop comprise the major areas of interest within the facility. The multi-purpose room can be configured to serve as a lecture hall or a dining room. It is covered with impressive [[photograph]]s from local and regional history. The museum contains information panels that cover each inductee's career and accomplishments through text, photographs, and various artifacts. 

In the center of the exhibit area, a replica of a 1930s [[Movie theater|theater]] [[marquee (sign)|marquee]] reminds visitors of the role of country music in [[film]]. A [[juke box]] nearby allows visitors to select the country songs that they wish to hear played while touring the museum. 

The marquee serves as the entrance to the [[Tex Ritter]] Museum. A native of Panola County, Ritter was one of the first singers inducted into the hall of fame when it was established in 1998. There is also a museum exhibit on Ritter's son, [[John Ritter]].   

[[Mickey Gilley]], a native of [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Moe Bandy]], originally from [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], [[Mississippi]],  not born in Texas though they have subsequently had a long associated with the state, Gilley with [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and Bandy with [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. On August 12, 2017, [[Kenny Rogers]], a Houston native who became one of the most successful performers in country music history in a career spanning nearly sixty years, was inducted into The Texas Country Music Hall of Fame. Plans are underway to double the size of the hall of fame in the area immediately to the rear of the building.

The museum is located at 301 West Panola near the intersection of [[U.S. Highway 59|U.S. Highways 59]] and [[U.S. Highway 79|79]]. Museum hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Admission is $10 for adults and $5 for children. Every Saturday evening, a Country Music Hayride is offered at the Esquire Theatre in downtown Carthage.

{{Russian music}}
'''VIA''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''ВИА'') is an abbreviation for Vocal-[Music] Instrumental-Ensemble ({{lang-ru|Вокально-инструментальный ансамбль}}, ''Vokalno-instrumentalny ansambl''). It is the general name used for [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] bands that were formally recognized by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government from the 1960s to the 1980s. 

In Soviet times, the term ''VIA'' generally meant ''band'', but it is now used in Russia to refer specifically to pop, rock, and folk groups active during the Soviet period.

The term VIA appeared in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and represented a model under which the Soviet government was willing to permit domestic rock and pop music acts to develop. To break through to the state-owned Soviet media, a band needed to become an officially recognized VIA. Each VIA had an artistic director (художественный руководитель) who served as manager, producer, and state-appointed censor. In some bands (such as Pesniary) the artistic director was the band's leading member and songwriter, while in others he played the role of impresario.

Soviet VIAs played a specific style of pop music. They performed youth-oriented (but officially approved) radio-friendly music, which combined contemporary Western and Soviet trends. Folk instruments were often used, and occasionally a [[keytar]] (a keyboard held like a guitar). Songs varied from pop ballads, dance-beat disco and new wave to mainstream rock (although bands avoided the "rock music" label until the late 1970s, because rock was considered "bourgeois" and formally banned). Many VIAs had up to ten members (including a number of vocalists and multi-instrumentalists), who were in frequent rotation. 

Due to state censorship, the lyrics of VIAs were family-friendly; typical topics were universal emotions like love, joy, and nostalgia, or idealized vignettes from daily life. Many bands also encouraged national culture and patriotism, (especially those of national minorities from the smaller Soviet republics) such as [[Yalla (band)|Yalla]] from [[Uzbekistan]], Labyrinth from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Chervona Ruta (ensemble)|Chervona Ruta]] from [[Ukraine]]. Folk-based VIAs such as [[Pesniary]] (later they mixed folk rock and progressive rock styles), Siabry and [[Verasy]] were especially popular in Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://democraticbelarus.eu/node/3879 “Pesnyary” – Legends in Bell-Bottoms]&lt;/ref&gt; Russian bands from Moscow and Leningrad (such as [[Zemlyane]] and [[Tsvety]]) were more oriented towards Western pop and rock music.

Many VIAs were created by musicians that played together in local choruses or musical theatrical productions. The earliest VIAs included Avangard (Avantgarde) in 1964, [[Poyushchiye Gitary]] (The Singing Guitars) in 1966, [[Vesyolye Rebyata]] (Jolly Fellows) in 1968, and Dobry Molodtsy (Good Guys) in 1969.

==Unique Characteristics==

The typical VIA consisted of 6 to 10 band members, with several singers and musicians capable of playing multiple instruments. Lead vocalists in VIAs usually did not play an instrument, but only sang. Virtually every member of a VIA was a professional musician with formal musical education and many years of performance experience.

The Soviet government had strict rules governing how members of a VIA were to behave on stage and conduct themselves in public. Movement around the stage was discouraged. Musicians typically remained in one place as they played their instruments or sang. Anything outside of the conservative "norm", such as tattoos, leather jackets, or metallic accessories were forbidden.

VIA song recordings were done by the State owned record company [[Melodiya]] (Melody). Concerts and performances were organized by professional associations such as Soyuzkontsert (Union Concerts), Moskontsert (Moscow Concerts), Lenkonsert (Leningrad Concerts), Roskontsert (Russian Concerts), and Goskontsert (Government Concerts), along with regional orchestra groups.

At times, a VIA would collaborate with a well-known solo singer to provide musical backing. Examples include [[Yuri Antonov (musician)|Yury Antonov]] and VIAs [[Araks]] and [[Aerobus]], [[Alla Pugacheva]] and VIA [[Retsital]], [[Sofia Rotaru]] and VIA [[Chervona Ruta]], [[Valeriy Obodzinskiy]] and VIA [[Verniye Druziya]], and [[Lev Leschenko]] and VIA [[Spektr]].

==Repertoire==
VIAs typically performed songs written by professional composers and lyricists who were members in good standing of the [[Union of Soviet Composers|Composers' Union]] and the [[Writers' Union of the U.S.S.R.|Writers' Union]] in the former Soviet Union. Some songs were created by VIA members or the VIA's artistic director. In the early 1980s, there was an unspoken rule that at least 80% of a VIA's performance repertoire had to be songs written by union members.

VIAs performed songs in a range of musical styles, including folk music, disco, rock, and synth-pop. Although tightly controlled by the government, VIAs had an enormous influence on the Russian public and created an audience for the rock music wave that followed. On the other hand, VIAs tended to deliver songs that were mainstream, simple in expression, and conservative in performance. Lyrics tended to focus on uncontroversial topics such as patriotic motifs, love stories, idealizations of work, light humor, ballads, current events, and folk themes. Any social criticism or protest was heavily censored and largely forbidden, except when directed against the West.

A number of VIAs did cover versions of foreign hits, typically changing the lyrics to entirely different meanings, but matching the music and vocalization. At times, VIAs went so far as to claim that the music was their own original work.

==Rise and Fall==
VIAs as a movement in Soviet music existed for approximately two decades, from the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s. They were very popular, particularly among Soviet youth. The best known VIAs would perform year round, giving several concerts a day. Many of these concerts received television and radio air time. Their albums sold tens of millions of copies. 

Most VIAs dissolved in the late 1980s. This was in part due to rock music becoming more popular and the censorship apparatus largely falling apart. The advent of synthesizers, samplers, and other technologies that enabled the creation of music without the use of a large number of musicians was also a contributing factor. Finally, the lyrical content of VIA songs became far less relevant in the new, more open society.

Although most VIAs disappeared, a number of VIA members enjoyed successful subsequent careers as solo performers or members of new bands. Many Russian pop and rock stars of the 1990s were VIA members in the 1970s and 1980s. A few of the most popular VIAs endured and continued to exist into the 1990s and thereafter, usually with a significantly different membership.

After "[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]" became a hit in London various other productions were put on around the world.  One of the earliest was in Australia.  The cast came from around [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

To help promote this production, a special version of the British musical soundtrack was released to help protmote the production.  This edition is noteworthy for having new album artwork and the inclusion of a new recording of [[Another One Bites The Dust]] by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] featuring as vocalist [[Annie Crummer]] who played the part of Killer Queen.

This recording was to later receive a single release in New Zealand.

'''Wild Waves Theme &amp; Water Park''' is an [[amusement park]] and [[water park]] in [[Federal Way, Washington]]. Opened in 1977 as '''The Enchanted Village''' (with its accompanying water park, '''Wild Waves''', opening in 1984),&lt;ref name=prNewsWire1&gt;''Washington State's Enchanted Parks Announces Plans to Add Two World-Class Roller Coasters by 2003''. PR Newswire. October 5, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; the park is a popular summer destination in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and it is Washington state's only water and amusement park. The park's name was reverted to Wild Waves Water Park and Enchanted Village Amusement Park in April 2016, and once again changed to Wild Waves Theme and Water Park in November 2016, as a result of the park's acquisition by EPR Properties.

==History==

===Founding and early years===
[[File:Wild_Waves_slide_tower.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hooks Lagoon]]
The Enchanted Village theme park was first opened in 1977 by Byron Betts. The initial {{convert|12|acre|m2|adj=on}} park site held only a half-dozen rides. In 1984, Wild Waves Waterpark was built adjacent to Enchanted Village;&lt;ref name=thrillnetwork&gt;ThrillNetwork.com - Wild Waves/Enchanted Village page&lt;/ref&gt; the combined amusement complex became known as Enchanted Parks. In 1991, co-owners Michael Moodenbaugh and Jeff Stock paid $8 million for Enchanted Parks. In 1993, Moodenbaugh traded his share of Enchanted Parks, Inc. for shares in their jointly owned amusement park in [[Amherstburg, Ontario|Amherstburg]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] called Boblo Island Amusement Park, Inc. In 1993, Jeff Stock purchased several rides from Boblo Island. Stock then sold his shares of Enchanted Parks, Inc. in late 2000 to Six Flags for $19.3 million.&lt;ref name=AssocPress&gt;''Six Flags buys Enchanted Parks''. Associated Press Newswires. December 8, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000 the park had grown to over {{convert|70|acre|m2}}, with more than 20 rides, and was the Northwest's largest waterpark.&lt;ref name=prNewsWire1/&gt; In 2002 and 2003, major expansion took place, with the addition of several new attractions, many manufactured by [[Zamperla]] and S&amp;S Power. Also in 2002, approximately 1000 seasonal workers were employed for positions as rides operators and food service workers. Many of these seasonal workers are also students of local high schools.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;''Six Flags to Add 10 New Rides at Federal Way, Wash., Amusement Park.'' KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Tacoma News Tribune. February 22, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The park's name was reverted to Enchanted Village and Wild Waves Water Park for the 2016 season to once again split the park into two separate parks instead of one.

===Ownership changes===
[[File:Wild Waves Theme Park - Federal Way WA.jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial view, with the large [[wave pool|Wave Pool]] visible to the right]]

In April 2007, [[Six Flags]] sold the park to Orlando-based [[real estate investment trust]] [[CNL Financial Group|CNL Income Properties]], which leased the park to [[PARC Management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2007/04/09/daily3.html?surround=lfn| title = Florida REIT buys Wild Waves in seven-park deal | publisher = Seattle.Bizjournals.com, May 3, 2007 | first=Puget | last=Sound | date=April 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, PARC Management had defaulted on its lease with CNL for Wild Waves and a majority of its other parks. Wild Waves was then placed under the new management of Norpoint Entertainment (owned by previous Wild Waves owner Jeff Stock). Stock implemented many changes to the park in 2011 including a new water ride for that season.

With the CNL Income Properties acquisition, the park was named Wild Waves Theme &amp; Water Park. Other parks owned by CNL included [[Darien Lake Theme Park Resort]], [[Elitch Gardens Theme Park|Elitch Gardens]], [[Frontier City]], [[SplashTown Waterpark]], [[White Water Bay (Oklahoma)|White Water Bay]], and [[Waterworld California]], all of which were bought in a $312 million purchase from [[Six Flags]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.therealestatebloggers.com/2007/04/10/6-former-six-flags-parks-sold-to-cnl-income-properties-reit/| title = CNL Income Properties Purchase | publisher = TheRealEstateBloggers.com, May 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Wild Waves and the other CNL properties were sold to EPR Properties, based in Kansas City, Missouri. The total price of all the properties was $456 million, although there was no specific price disclosed for Wild Waves. The parks were placed under the management of [[Premier Parks, LLC]].

===August 2016 drowning accident===

On August 20, 2016, a 33-year-old man died in the Activity Pool due to drowning.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-dies-at-wild-waves-water-park-in-apparent-drowning/| title = Man dies at Wild Waves water park in apparent drowning | publisher = CBS News, August 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A police report noted multiple missed chances to attempt a rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://komonews.com/news/local/police-report-shows-missed-chances-in-wild-waves-drowning/| title = Police report shows missed chances in Wild Waves drowning | publisher = KOMO News, August 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, children reported a body at the bottom of the pool to a lifeguard, who "believed that they were pranking him and did not think anything of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/wild-waves-expresses-condolences-for-man-who-died-at-federal-way-water-park/| title = Police report: Wild Waves lifeguard didn't believe kids who reported body in pool | publisher = The Seattle Times, August 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement released by police, Wild Waves said they actively reviewed the accident, their safety protocols, and the actions taken by staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.people.com/article/man-drowns-washington-water-park| title = Man Who Drowned at Wild Waves Water Park Might Have Been Underwater 15 Minutes Before Lifeguards Spotted Him: Reports | publisher = People, August 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Cube Association''' ('''WCA''') is the worldwide organization that regulates and holds competitions for mechanical puzzles that are operated by twisting groups of pieces, commonly known as '' twisty puzzles'' (a subcategory of [[combination puzzles]]). The most famous of those puzzles is the [[Rubik's Cube]]. The WCA was founded by [[Ron van Bruchem]] of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Tyson Mao]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="cofounders"&gt;{{cite web |title=New WCA board member |url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/archive/forum_topics/39 |website=World Cube Association |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |date=September 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the World Cube Association is to have "more competitions in more countries with more people and more fun, under fair conditions."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |title=About the WCA |url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/about |publisher=World Cube Association |accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, they started work to become a non-profit organization and on November 20, 2017 the state of California accepted the initial registration of the World Cube Association.

The organization is run by the board members. It assigns different teams and committees as well as delegates who can organize official competitions. The presence of a delegate is required in order to make the competition official. {{As of|2018|07}}, more than 100,000 people from around the world have participated in WCA competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/statistics.php#most_persons|title=WCA Statistics|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of the WCA==
===WCA Board of Directors===
The WCA Board of Directors (or simply WCA Board) is the leadership team of the WCA and its highest authority. WCA Directors are Officers of the WCA and in addition have the role of Full Delegate. The WCA Board is responsible for the WCA organization as a whole. As part of their day-to-day work, they discuss issues that affect the WCA and advise the committees. The WCA Board oversees that the applications to hold WCA Competitions meet fair conditions to give all the world similar chances to compete, and finally approves and announces the competitions accordingly. After competitions, they read reports from the WCA delegates about competitions in order to be up to date on the WCA activity worldwide and take part in the discussion of any incidents that occur.

The Board is also responsible for helping WCA fulfill its mission: “more competitions in more countries with more people and more fun, under fair and equal conditions.” This means spreading cubing to new communities and countries and working together with the Senior Delegates to open up cubing to even more people.

===WCA Teams and Committees===
====WCA Communication Team====
The WCA Communications Team (WCT) is in charge of overseeing and supporting communications of the WCA with the community and general public. This includes answering general requests that are submitted via the WCA website and maintaining the social media accounts of the WCA. The team responds to multiple emails a day from all around the world regarding starting cubing competitions in new areas, what to do for your first competition, big media requests about competitive speedcubing, and many other issues. Many requests are also forwarded to the appropriate WCA team or delegate if they are in regard to a particular competition or specialization.

====WCA Disciplinary Committee====
The WCA Disciplinary Committee (WDC) investigates a variety of situations and proposes solutions including punishments when necessary. Among other topics, these situations could be serious violations of WCA regulations or community issues. They deal with many instances of cheating, general conduct, or disputes in the way that delegates and organizers run events. They are also responsible for issues that may occur in the WCA internally.

They can be contacted by WCA officials or community members to be made aware of possible violations at WCA competitions. Initial contact with the team is usually through emails or directly from any competitor or delegate. If the Team Leader agrees that this case falls under the WDC’s jurisdiction, a WDC case is initiated. The team attempts to correspond with everyone involved, to get all sides of the story and to provide an independent report for the investigation. Once the case is closed and the decision made, they inform all relevant persons of any actions and make a public announcement, if necessary.

====WCA Financial Committee====
The WCA Financial Committee (WFC) is responsible for everything regarding finances within the WCA. As an Advisory Committee, they manage the finances and accounts of the WCA in accordance with an approved annual budget proposal, which is also their work to provide on a regular basis. Similarly, the Financial Committee pays invoices and taxes that are directed to the WCA, after consultation and with permission of the WCA Board. On a quarterly basis they report and advise the WCA Board on all finances of the WCA, to give them a summary of the scope of financial possibilities and options that the WCA has.

====WCA Regulations Committee====
The WCA Regulations Committee (WRC) was founded to support the WCA Board in maintaining the WCA Regulations in 2011. Over the years, their area of responsibility has been broadened, so that they handle all issues which are related to the application, the improvement and the development of the WCA Regulations today. They support delegates on any kind of procedural matters happening at competitions and decide on unresolved and uncovered incidents. The WRC regularly publishes WCA internal reports to help all delegates and improve their knowledge of the Regulations.
This includes regulation changes based on feedback from the WCA staff and the community, while also taking into account their own insights and reports of incidents that occur during WCA competitions. New versions of the Regulations are published on a periodic basis. Another part of their work is to encourage members of the WCA community to create and maintain translations of the Regulations.

====WCA Results Team====
The WCA Results Team (WRT) is responsible for managing all data in the databases of the WCA, most importantly competition results and person data.

The most time-consuming regular task of the WCA Results Team is posting results of WCA competitions to the WCA website, once the delegate of the competition has sent them in. They rigorously check if the results were submitted correctly and if so, transfer them into the WCA results database. This work of the Results Team assures the data quality of the databases of the WCA. Each such posting procedure is ended by creating a public post on the WCA website - these are the posts that you can see on the front page of the WCA website!
Apart from posting competition results, the WCA Results Team is also responsible for making corrections to competition results if necessary and they are in charge of administering all WCA profile pages. This includes for example changing user data, like dates of birth, according to verified requests and managing profile picture requests.

====WCA Software Team====
The WCA website is a huge open source project on [[Github]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org|title=WCA Github Repository|publisher=World Cube Association|access-date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They bring continuous improvements to the website very frequently, to allow all of community members to easily access and enjoy WCA content. Recently internationalization was implemented, so now people can use the WCA website in their native language. Other important milestones are the development of the registration system, and especially payments. The team keeps an eye on the website all the time to ensure it's permanently available and they react as fast as possible whenever something is wrong.

The Software Team develops new software for various tasks within the WCA whenever needed. Thus, they created an app simplifying translating the website, to engage more people translating into their language. Also, few years back, the WCA Workbook assistant was designed, which is used by all delegates to submit the competition results to the WCA Results Team. The Software Team also updates the official WCA Scrambler, TNoodle, according to data provided by the WCA Regulations Committee if changes are needed. Additionally, they maintain and develop administrative tools for various Delegates, Committees and Board members on the WCA website.

===WCA Delegates===
WCA Delegates are members of the WCA who are responsible for making sure that all WCA competitions are run according to the mission, regulations, and spirit of the WCA. This means that at every competition a WCA Delegate needs to be present to be considered official. The WCA has three different types of delegates: WCA Senior Delegates, WCA Delegates and WCA Candidate Delegates. Beyond the duties of a WCA Delegate a WCA Senior Delegate is responsible for managing the delegates in their area and should also be contacted by the community for regional matters. They are available to mentor the delegates in their area - especially when new communities are being developed. New delegates are listed as WCA Candidate Delegates at first and need to show their ability of managing competitions successfully before being listed as WCA Delegates. If possible they may delegate their first competitions alongside more experienced delegates to get the hang of all responsibilities connected to delegate a WCA competition.

All acknowledged WCA Delegates, Candidate Delegates and Senior Delegates can be found on their official Website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/delegates |title=WCA Delegates |publisher=World Cube Association |access-date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
WCA Delegates are present at competition. Each competition requires at least one WCA delegate. WCA Delegates are members of the WCA who are responsible for making sure that all WCA competitions are run according to the mission, regulations and spirit of the WCA. The WCA distinguishes between WCA Senior Delegates, WCA Delegates and WCA Candidate Delegates. Additional to the duties of a WCA Delegate, a WCA Senior Delegate is responsible for managing the Delegates in their area and can also be contacted by the community for regional matters. Delegates are at first listed as WCA Candidate Delegates and need to show that they are capable of managing competitions successfully before being listed as WCA Delegates.

The WCA acknowledges the following members as delegates for official WCA competitions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/delegates |title=WCA Delegates |publisher=World Cube Association |publisher=World Cube Association|access-date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1999, the first modern age speedcubers found each other on the Internet via [[Rubik's Games]], a computer game with an electronic version of the [[Rubik's Cube]]. [[Chris Hardwick (speedcuber)|Chris Hardwick]] from Raleigh, NC founded the Yahoo! Group "Speedsolvingrubikscube" and the Unofficial World Records, a place where cubers could post their personal best times. [[Ron van Bruchem]] started speedcubing.com together with his friend Ton Dennenbroek, an avid puzzle collector.

Because the cubers were living all over the world, they wanted to organize a competition at which they could all meet. In 2003, under the guidance of Dan Gosbee, they organized the Rubik's Cube World Championship in [[Toronto]]. This first modern-age Rubik's Cube competition was a huge success, but there were lots of issues, largely due to the lack of any regulations. After the World Championship, van Bruchem and [[Tyson Mao]] started organizing competitions in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]], as well as at [[Caltech]] in the [[United States]]. In 2004, they started the World Cube Association, which today has held competitions in more than 90 countries.

==Events==
Currently, the WCA offers competitions in 18 events. Not all of them are offered at every competition, but they are usually all offered at national and global championships.
