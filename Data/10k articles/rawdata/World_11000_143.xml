The '''Anglo-Dane''' was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[automobile]] manufactured by [[H. C. Fredriksen]] of [[Copenhagen]] from 1902 to 1917. Fredriksen began by building [[bicycle]]s in the 1890s; for these he used [[United Kingdom|British]] parts - hence the hyphenated name.

The first cars were light trucks with [[single-cylinder]] [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Kelecom]] engines.  Later cars were produced with an own design [[single-cylinder]] 4-5 [[horsepower|hp]] engines; these featured [[friction drive]] using double discs to give an equivalent 12 speed transmission. A few passenger cars were also built with [[Multi-cylinder engine#Two-cylinder engines|twin-cylinder]] engines before the company merged with automobile makers [[Jan (automobile)|Jan]] and [[Thrige (automobile)|Thrige]], which made [[Triangel (vehicle manufacturer)|Triangel]] commercial vehicles until 1945.  About 70 Anglo-Danes were made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4148">[[File:Schesaplana2.JPG|thumb|260px|Aerial view of [[Lünersee]], with the Swiss-Austrian border running along the ridge in the foreground; [[Schesaplana]] is visible center left, [[Säntis]] in the background left, and the [[Alpine Rhine Valley]] and [[Lake Constance]] in the background right]]
The modern states of [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] share a border with a length of 180&amp;nbsp;km&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/knowledge-facts/sovereign-border/national-boundary.html National boundary] ([[swisstopo]])&lt;/ref&gt; in two parts, separated by [[Liechtenstein]], the longer stretch running across the [[Grison Alps]] and the shorter one following the [[Alpine Rhine]] to its mouth at [[Lake Constance]].

==History==
The course of the border ultimately reflects the success of the various rivals of the [[House of Habsburg]] (most notably the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] and the [[Three Leagues]]) in limiting the influence of the Habsburg [[Archdukes of Austria]] in the original Habsburg domains west of the Rhine in the 14th and 15th centuries. Most of the Alpine part of the border had already been the outer border of the [[Three Leagues]] since the 15th century (with the exception of the [[Vinschgau]], which was acquired by Austria only in 1499 and remained disputed territory into the 18th century). By contrast, the [[Alpine Rhine Valley]] has a complicated feudal history (being partly acquired by the [[Counts of Toggenburg]] during the 14th and 15th centuries), but the territories on its left bank had become subject territories of the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Swiss Confederacy]] by the 17th century.

The current border is a product of the creation of the [[Helvetic Republic]] in 1798. During the 19th century it was part of the western border of the [[Austrian Empire]] and later [[Austria-Hungary]], and in the 20th century of the [[First Austrian Republic]], the [[Federal State of Austria]], [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Allied-occupied Austria]], and eventually of modern [[Austria]] since its formation in 1955. 
[[Liechtenstein]] was created as an independent principality under the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)]], although it remained nominally a member of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] until 1866).

Switzerland's accession to the [[Schengen Area]] in December 2008 removed all passport checks between the two countries. However, Swiss and Austrian customs officials retain a presence at well-frequented border crossings as they still have the authority to stop travellers to carry out customs checks, as Switzerland is outside of the [[European Union Customs Union|EU Customs Union]].

==Geography==
The Swiss-Austrian-Italian tripoint is north of [[Piz Lad]], in the [[Engadin]]. The border follows the [[Inn River]] between [[Martina, Switzerland|Martina]] and [[Nauders]] and then runs west towards [[Samnaun]]. It cuts across the [[High Alps]], connecting the peaks of [[Grübelekopf]] (2,894 m), [[Bürkelkopf]] (3,033 m), [[Greitspitz]] (2,867 m), [[Piz Rots]] (3,097 m), [[Fluchthorn]] (3,398 m), [[Augstenberg]] (3,230 m), [[Piz Buin]] (3,312 m) and [[Gross Seehorn]] (3,122 m), roughly following the northern watershed of Engadin, and then to [[Isentällispitz]] (2,873 m) and [[Schesaplana]] (2,964 m), along the northern watershed of [[Prättigau]] valley, meeting the southern tripoint of Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein at [[Naafkopf]] (2,570 m).

From the northern Swiss-Austrian-Liechtenstein tripoint, the Swiss-Austrian border follows the [[Alpine Rhine]] (which already formed the Swiss-Liechtenstein border), passing east of [[Diepoldsau]] and reaching [[Lake Constance]] at [[Rheineck]]; the Swiss-Austrian-German tripoint is within Lake Constance.

'''Baikal''' is a [[Russia]]n non-alcoholic [[beverage]] of dark-brown colour. The beverage's basis is [[water]], but it also contains extracts of natural  herbs, [[sugar]], [[citric acid]], [[carbon dioxide]]. Baikal's production started in 1969. It was developed as a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] counterpart of [[Coca-Cola]]. After the beginning of [[Pepsi|Pepsi Сola]] production in the [[USSR]] in 1973, the formula was revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zykov|first=N|date=1973|title=Квас, ситро и «пепси-кола»|url=http://www.ateismy.net/index.php/2012-09-22-15-33-38/1659-q-q116|journal=[[Nauka i Zhizn]]|volume=8|pages=30-32|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Moscow in the 1990s, it was nearly impossible to find Baikal; nevertheless, in Saint Petersburg the beverage's production was continued by the "Polustrovo" factory.

In 2009, a Dutch photographer who spent nearly two decades in Moscow relaunched the production of the drink in Germany having changed its design, taste and tradename. The new drink's trademark is [[Wostok (drink)|WOSTOK]] (which means 'East' in Russian).

However, there still exist generic carbonated soft drinks with [[guarana]] extract containing caffeine under the name Baikal made by various companies – for instance SLCO GmbH (Siberia Group) in Germany. The degree of their similarity to the original [[Soviet]] Baikal drink is unknown.

'''Burns &amp; Porter''' was a business in the [[United Kingdom]] that prepared and distributed [[pub quiz]]zes. In 1976, Sharon Burns and Tom Porter founded and organised 32 pub quiz teams in three leagues in southern [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Devine |first1=Marion |year=1988 |title=Who is the woman behind all those pub competitions |journal=Director Magazine |issue= February 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns and Porter travelled the country for the next few years, presenting their quizzes to breweries as a [[marketing]] strategy to bring customers to their pubs on slow evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1991 |title=Asking the right questions made me a fortune |journal=Woman's Realm |issue= April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns and Porter cornered the market in pub quizzes, with over 10,000 teams playing in one of their quizzes every week in the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1991 |title=Who wants to be a millionaire, they do! |journal=Woman's Realm |issue= April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[BBC]] and independent television companies tapped them for contestants and questions for television [[quiz show]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1991 |title=Who wants to be a millionaire, they do! |journal=Woman's Realm |issue= April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Burns &amp; Porter Pub Quiz books were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Burns and Porter Pub Quiz Book |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Burns-Porter-Pub-Quiz-Book/dp/B00302F7O4 |date=December 1987 |publisher=CORGI }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was awarded southern England's most efficient business in 1986, the award was sponsored by [[British Telecom]] PLC.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} In 1988, Burns &amp; Porter was sold to [[Prism Leisure Corporation]] PLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quiz Kid has Quit |newspaper=Sunday Sport |date=August 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon Burns remained as Managing Director of the company for two years.{{cn|date=September 2017}} She now only does quizzes for charity whilst running her own property business and hobby vineyard called Sour Grapes, based in Michelmersh, HAMPSHIRE.

== History ==

Pub quizzes were played in some pubs mainly in the North of England. They were a popular activity, which took place mainly in the public bars of pubs, alongside other pub games such as darts and pool. They had little organisation, and would be held on a very localised and one off match basis.

== Origin ==
In 1975/6 a new partnership was formed between Sharon Burns and Tom Porter, whose objective was to get people into pubs on quiet trading nights, by creating  entertainment that was inexpensive to put on and could be run across many outlets simultaneously. After much fact finding and debate, the first pub quiz leagues were formed with 32 teams who were fixtured to play against each other in three leagues, home and away matches, on Sunday nights throughout Hampshire and Dorset. Burns &amp; Porter were responsible for sending question sets in sealed envelopes out to the pubs each week, and then collecting in the results each week, forming up to date league tables and sending them to the teams.

The '''Church of St Matthew''', also known as '''San Mattew tal-Maqluba''', is a [[Roman Catholic]] church located in [[Qrendi]] in [[Malta]].

==History==
The church of St Matthew dates its origins to 1674. It is important not to confuse this church with the medieval and smaller [[St Matthew's Chapel (Iż-Żgħir)|chapel of St Matthew]] located just on the right hand side of the church. The larger church was finished by 1682. The church was blessed by the parish priest of Qrendi Dumink Formosa on September 12, 1683. 
[[File:San_Mattew_tal_Maqluba_church.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The interior]]
On April 12, 1942 the church suffered extensive damage to the point of nearly collapsing as a result of a direct hit by Nazi bombs during World War II, it being so close to the nearby military airfield. The church was repaired by architect S. Privitera. A new facade was built and two small belfries were built instead of the central belfry.&lt;ref&gt;Spiteri, Mikiel (2000). ''A hundred wayside chapels of Malta and Gozo'', p. 266. Heritage Books, Valletta. {{ISBN|9789990993059}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works of art==
The main painting behind the high altar, attributed to [[Mattia Preti]], depicts the martyrdom of St [[Matthew the Apostle]] and dates from 1688. It is believed that this painting was commissioned by the French Commendatory Nicola’ Communette. In 1984 this paining was stolen by was later recovered and kept for some time in the cathedral museum. An organ gallery was also built in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parroccaqrendi.org/chapels.html "THE  CHAPELS OF QRENDI"], ''Qrendi parish church'', Malta. Retrieved on 15 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, since 2001, the main articles are also published in an online [[English language|English-language]] version.
All three language editions and the archives are freely available online.

The paper is non-[[partisan (political)|partisan]], while strongly [[Liberalism|liberal]]-leaning by Ukrainian standards. It maintains high [[journalist]]ic standards.&lt;ref name=a2/&gt;&lt;ref name=a1/&gt; Zerkalo Nedeli is partially funded by [[Western world|Western]] [[non-governmental organization]]s.

'''Eney''' ({{lang-uk|'''Еней'''}}) was a [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian]] [[rock music|rock]] band that performed its own [[repertoire]]. It was named after the famous character, [[Aeneas]], from one of the [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky#The first modern Ukrainian writer|literal works]] of [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]].

==History==
During the 1960s Students from the Kievan special music school formed a band named after Ukrainian composer [[Mykola Lysenko]]. They initially played unique interpretations of Ukrainian folk songs. Later its members were exposed to the late works of [[The Beatles]] and started to rearrange works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Khachaturian]]. In 1971 the band split as Petrynenko and Blinov left it to form the new band called ''Dzvony''. The band started to experiment in new genres: blues and soul. In 1972 the band and their music where banned in the Soviet Union and labeled "bourgeois-national". As a result, all existing records and recordings were destroyed. After that the band went underground until 1974. The members then merged with ''Dzvony'' into the new vocal-instrumental ensemble ''Decorative Trails''. After the band was accepted to the ''Ukr-kontsert'' it changed its name to ''Hrono''. In 1977 the ensemble became known as ''Eney'' once again. After a period of time, ''Eney'' broke up and its members either joined different bands or went solo. [[Taras Petrynenko|Petrynenko]] later created his own band [[Hrono]].

The '''Flag of the Orange River Colony''' was the official flag of the [[Orange River Colony]] in South Africa from 1903 to 1910.  It formed part of a system of colonial flags that was used throughout the [[British Empire]].  It was superseded by the [[Flag of the Union of South Africa]].

==History==
In a series of decisions made in 1864, 1865, and 1869, the British government decided that every colony should have a distinctive badge, to be displayed on flags at sea.  The governor was to display the badge in the centre of the [[Union Jack]] when travelling by sea;  vessels owned by the colony's government were to display it in the fly of the [[Blue Ensign]];  and, with [[Admiralty]] permission, privately owned ships registered in the colony could display the badge in the fly of the [[Red Ensign]].  This system is still in operation in the remaining British overseas territories.&lt;ref name=wcf&gt;Weekes, N. (2008).  ''Colonial Flag Badges : A Chronology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A flag badge was duly approved for the Orange River Colony (formerly the [[Orange Free State]] republic), shortly after it had been annexed to the British Empire in 1902.  It is unclear whether the landlocked colony actually used the defaced Blue Ensign.&lt;ref name=bsa&gt;Burgers, A.P. (2008).  ''The South African Flag Book''.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Description==
The badge was circular, and showed a springbok standing on a grassy base.  It was evidently derived from the colony's new Public Seal, which depicted the British royal arms and a landscape scene showing three springboks standing in the veld. &lt;ref name=bnps&gt;Brownell, F.G. (1993).  ''National and Provincial Symbols''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solar Impulse SI2 pilote Bertrand Piccard Payerne November 2014.jpg|thumb|300px|The longest non-stop solo airplane flight in history (4 days, 21 hours and 51 minutes) was achieved by [[André Borschberg]] in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[solar airplane]] ''[[Solar Impulse]]''.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;]]

The '''flight endurance record''' is the longest amount of time an aircraft of a particular category spent in flight without landing. It can be a solo event, or multiple people can take turns piloting the aircraft, as long as all pilots remain in the aircraft. The limit initially was the amount of fuel that could be stored for the flight, but [[aerial refueling]] extended that parameter.  Due to safety concerns, the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) no longer recognizes new records for the duration of manned airplane or glider flights and has never recognized any duration records for helicopters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2379">The '''Forgeries of Lorch''', also known as '''Lorch Forgeries''', is a collection of forged [[papal bulls]] completed in the second half of the {{nobr|10th century}}.

== Background ==

Most specialists agree that the collection of documents, known as the ''Forgeries of Lorch'', was completed for [[Piligrim]], who was made [[Bishop of Passau]] in 971.{{sfn|Arnold|2003|p=75}}{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=8}} After he came into conflict with Frederick I, [[Archbishop of Salzburg]] for the ecclesiastic jurisdiction in Pannonia, Piligrim forged papal bulls.{{sfn|Arnold|2003|p=75}}{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=8}} The earliest of the bulls was attributed to the 4th-century [[Pope Symmachus]].{{sfn|Arnold|2003|p=75}}

Piligrim believed that [[Lauriacum]] (now Lorch in [[Enns (town)|Enns]] in Austria) was the [[metropolitan see]] of the [[Diocese of Pannonia]] in the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Arnold|2003|p=75}} He also thought that the see had been moved from Lauriacum to Passau.{{sfn|Arnold|2003|p=75}}

==Documents==
Pilgrim's counterfeits, were to make the diocese of Passau the legal successor to the ancient archbishopric of [[Lauriacum]], thus establishing the rank of an [[archbishopric]]. This [[late antiquity|late antique]] bishopric Lauriacum ([[Lorch, Austria]]) was mentioned in the [[Vita Sancti Severini]]. Pilgrim's forgeries include six papal documents falsified or corrupted by Bishop [[Pilgrim of Passau]] between 971 and 985 as scribes of the royal firm, a letter from the bishop to Pope Benedict VI. Or Benedict VII, as well as two alleged letters of Archbishop Hatto from Mainz to an unnamed Pope.

It was located about 2&amp;nbsp;km east of central [[Praia, Cape Verde|Praia]] in the southeastern part of the island of Santiago. After Cape Verdean independence, the airport was named after [[Francisco Mendes]], a [[Guinea-Bissau]] independence activist and that country's first Prime Minister.

==History==
On 28 September 1998, a TACV [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] ([[aircraft registration|registered]] D4-CAX) carrying [[Carlos Veiga]], then [[List of heads of government of Cape Verde|Prime Minister of Cape Verde]], 18 other passengers and three crew members crash-landed at the airport. There was one fatality (a bodyguard of the prime minister) and four people were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19980928-0|title=ASN aircraft accident Monday 28 September 1998|author=Aviation Safety Network|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2005, the airport was deactivated, and replaced by the new Praia International Airport (since 2012 [[Nelson Mandela International Airport]]).

==Background==
The group was formed by [[Gunnar Graps]] in January, 1984 in [[Tallinn]] after his previous [[Magnetic Band]] was banned by Soviet authorities. In 1980s, the GGG achieved popularity also in [[Russia]].

After the band's participation in [[Tartu]] rock-festival in 1984, the group entered to state philarmonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlymetal.ru/book221.html GGG history] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; GGG played the songs of Graps, [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Rolling Stones]] and others.

Among the most popular songs of GGG are "Roosid papale", "Rahatuvi", "Äärelinna blues", "Onu Volli lugu", "Tühjad pihud", "Raudmees", "Valgus".

According to [[Stas Namin]], "Gunnar was a real, non-compromise rock-n-roll man. He always demonstrated the ''clear style''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rock-n-roll.ru/details.php?mode=show&amp;id=1789 GGG at Rock-n-roll.Ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Harga''''' is a 2010 [[documentary]] film.

== Synopsis ==
Hichem has dreamt with "harga" since he was a child. One day he set forth on the sea towards [[Europe]], on the grand forbidden voyage in a precarious open boat with 27 other Tunisians, some of whom were his friends. Hichem is the only one who has come back. Other Tunisians tell us why they want to leave their country: [[Poverty]], [[unemployment]], no hope for the future, trapped in a dead end. They are ready to do anything to improve their situation, and that includes risking their lives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2307">The '''International Time Bureau''' ({{lang-fr|Bureau International de l'Heure}}, abbreviated '''BIH''') seated at the [[Paris Observatory]], was the international bureau responsible for combining different measurements of [[Universal Time]]. The bureau also played an important role in the research of [[time]] keeping. In 1987 the responsibilities of the bureau were taken over by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) and the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS).

==History==
The creation of the BIH was decided upon during the 1912 ''Conférence internationale de l'heure radiotélégraphique''. The following year an attempt was made to regulate the international status of the bureau through the creation of an [[international convention]]. However, the convention wasn't ratified by its member countries due to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. In 1919, after the war, it was decided upon to make the bureau the executive body of the ''International Commission of Time'', one of the commissions of the then newly founded [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU).

From 1956 until 1987 the BIH was part of the Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical Data Analysis Services (FAGS). In 1987 the bureau's tasks of combining different measurements of [[Universal Time]] were taken over by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]]. Its tasks related to the correction of time with respect to the [[Astronomical object|celestial]] [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] and the [[earth's rotation]] were taken over by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|IERS]].

== In popular culture ==

Time Bureau is a organisation tasked with fixing timeline anachronisms formed by [[Rip Hunter]] in season 3 of [[Legends of Tomorrow]], an American superhero television series.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Located in the heart of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Italy shares [[open borders|open land borders]] with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino, and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of {{convert|301340|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and has a largely [[Temperate climate|temperate seasonal]] and [[Mediterranean climate]]. With around 61 million inhabitants, it is the [[List of European Union member states by population|fourth-most populous EU member state]] and the most populous country in [[southern Europe]].

Due to its central geographic location in Europe and the Mediterranean, Italy has historically been home to a myriad of peoples and cultures. In addition to the various [[List of ancient peoples of Italy|ancient Italian tribes]] and [[Italic peoples]] dispersed throughout the [[Italian Peninsula]] and [[insular Italy]], beginning from the [[Classical antiquity|classical]] era, [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] and [[Magna Graecia|Greeks]] established settlements in the [[Southern Italy|south of Italy]], with [[Etruscans]] and [[Celts]] inhabiting the [[Central Italy|centre]] and the [[Northern Italy|north]] of Italy respectively. The Italic tribe known as the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] formed the [[Roman Kingdom]] in the 8th century BC, which eventually became a [[Roman Republic|republic]] that [[Roman conquest of Italy|conquered]] and [[Romanization (cultural)|assimilated]] its neighbours. In the first century BC, the [[Roman Empire]] emerged as the dominant power in the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and became the leading cultural, political and religious [[Caput Mundi|centre]] of [[Western world|Western civilisation]]. The [[legacy of the Roman Empire]] is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of [[civilian law]], [[republican government]]s, [[History of Christianity|Christianity]] and the [[Latin script]].

During the [[Early Middle Ages]], Italy endured [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|sociopolitical collapse]] and [[barbarian invasions]], but by the 11th century, numerous rival [[Italian city-states|city-states]] and [[maritime republics]], mainly in the northern and central regions of Italy, rose to great prosperity through shipping, commerce and banking, laying the groundwork for modern capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sée|first=Henri|title=Modern Capitalism Its Origin and Evolution|url=http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|work=University of Rennes|publisher=Batoche Books|accessdate=29 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007010542/http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|archivedate=7 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mostly independent statelets served as Europe's main trading hubs with Asia and the Near East, often enjoying a greater degree of democracy than the larger [[feudalism|feudal]] monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe; however, part of central Italy was under the control of the [[theocratic]] [[Papal States]], while [[Southern Italy]] remained largely feudal until the 19th century, partially as a result of a succession of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Arab]], [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman]], [[House of Valois-Anjou|Angevin]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Spanish]] conquests of the region.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jepson|first1=Tim|title=National Geographic Traveler: Italy|date=2012|publisher=National Geographic Books,|url={{Google books|f2jihJ0bq4EC|page=PA28|keywords=trade%20routes%20italy%20new world|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=9781426208614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian culture flourished, producing famous scholars, artists and [[polymaths]] such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]. During the Middle Ages, Italian explorers such as [[Marco Polo]], [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Amerigo Vespucci]], [[John Cabot]] and [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] discovered new routes to the [[Far East]] and the [[New World]], helping to usher in the European [[Age of Discovery]]. Nevertheless, Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes that bypassed the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonetto|first1=Cristian|title=Discover Italy|date=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|url={{Google books|OnmfD4Ue3RMC|page=PA169|keywords=new%20world%20trade italy|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=9781741799958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bouchard&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bouchard|first1=Norma|last2=Ferme|first2=Valerio|title=Italy and the Mediterranean: Words, Sounds, and Images of the Post-Cold War Era|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|url={{Google books|_XwhAQAAQBAJ|page=PT30|keywords=new%20world%20trade italy|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=17 December 2015|isbn=9781137343468}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries of infighting between the Italian city-states, such the [[Italian Wars]] of the 15th and 16th centuries, left the region fragmented, and it was subsequently conquered by [[Power (international relations)#Modern Age European powers|European powers]] such as [[First French Empire|France]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]].

Hypotheses for the etymology of the name "Italia" are numerous.&lt;ref name= Manco&gt;Alberto Manco, ''Italia. Disegno storico-linguistico'', 2009, [[Napoli]], L'Orientale, {{ISBN|978-88-95044-62-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One is that it was borrowed via [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] from the [[Oscan language|Oscan]] ''Víteliú'' 'land of calves' (''cf.'' [[Latin|Lat]] ''vitulus'' "calf", [[Umbrian language|Umb]] ''vitlo'' "calf")&lt;!-- and named for the god of cattle, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams, ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The bull was a symbol of the southern Italic tribes and was often depicted goring the Roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free Italy during the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]]. Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after [[Italus]],&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
''Roman Antiquities'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html 1.35], on LacusCurtius&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned also by [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D7%3Asection%3D1329b#note-link2 7.1329b] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910185719/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D7%3Asection%3D1329b |date=10 September 2015 }}, on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+6.2.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 6.2.4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924213434/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+6.2.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 |date=24 September 2015 }}, on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Italia'' originally applied only to a part of what is now [[Southern Italy]],  according to [[Antiochus of Syracuse]], the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula corresponding to the  modern province of [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]], and part of the provinces of [[Catanzaro]] and [[Vibo Valentia]]. But by his time [[Oenotria]] and Italy had become synonymous, and the name also applied to most of [[Lucania]] as well. The Greeks gradually came to apply the name "Italia" to a larger region, but the Peninsula and its borders expanded over time.&lt;ref&gt;Pallottino, M., ''History of Earliest Italy'', trans. Ryle, M &amp; Soper, K. in Jerome Lectures, Seventeenth Series, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'', before the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]], the name was used by Greeks to indicate the land between the [[strait of Messina]] and the line connecting the [[gulf of Salerno]] and [[gulf of Taranto]], corresponding roughly to the current region of [[Calabria]]. Later the term was extended by Romans to include the Italian Peninsula up to the [[Rubicon]], a river located between [[Northern Italy|Northern]] and [[Central Italy]]. In 49 BC, with the ''[[Lex Roscia]]'', [[Julius Caesar]] gave Roman citizenship to the people of the [[Cisalpine Gaul]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cassius|first1=Dio|authorlink=Cassius Dio|title=Historia Romana|volume=41|at=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 42 BCE the hitherto existing province was abolished, thus extending Italy to the north up to the southern foot of the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laffi|first1=Umberto|title=La provincia della Gallia Cisalpina|date=1992|journal=Athenaeum|issue=80|pages=5–23|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=au&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aurigemma|first1=Salvatore|title=Gallia Cisalpina|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/gallia-cisalpina_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/|website=www.treccani.it|publisher=Enciclopedia Italiana|accessdate=14 October 2014|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the reign of [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Augustus]] that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula until the Alps.&lt;ref name=au/&gt; The islands of Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily and Malta were added to Italy by [[Diocletian]] in 292 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297743/Italy |title=Italy (ancient Roman territory) |website=britannica.com |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Rome|Rome]], a settlement around a ford on the river [[Tiber]] conventionally [[Founding of Rome|founded]] in 753 BC, was ruled for a period of 244 years by a [[Roman Kingdom|monarchical]] system, initially with sovereigns of [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] and [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin, later by [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: [[Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]], [[Tullus Hostilius]], [[Ancus Marcius]], [[Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]] and [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. In 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an [[Roman Republic|oligarchic republic]].

In the wake of [[Julius Caesar]]'s rise and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|death]] in the first century B.C., Rome grew over the course of centuries into a massive [[Roman empire|empire]] stretching from [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britain]] to the borders of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Persia]], and engulfing the whole [[Mediterranean]] basin, in which Greek and Roman and many other cultures merged into a unique [[Greco-Roman world|civilisation]]. The long and triumphant reign of the first emperor, [[Augustus]], began a golden age of peace and prosperity. The Italian Peninsula was named [[Roman Italy|Italia]] and, as the territory of the city of Rome, maintained a special status which made it "not a province, but the ''[[Dominus (title)|Domina]]'' (ruler) of the [[Roman province|provinces]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mommsen |first=Theodor |author-link=Theodor Mommsen |year=1855 |title=History of Rome, Book II: From the Abolition of the Monarchy in Rome to the Union of Italy |location=Leipzig |publisher=Reimer &amp; Hirsel |isbn= |title-link=History of Rome (Mommsen) }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than [[Pax Romana|two centuries of stability]] followed, during which Italy was referred to as the ''rectrix mundi'' (queen of the world) and ''omnium terrarum parens'' (motherland of all lands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fear|first=Andrew |date=25 March 2010 |title=Historiae Mundi: Studies in Universal History |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hb6OAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;q=Rectrix%20mundi%20omnium%20terrarum%20parens  |author-link= |isbn=9781472519801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a slow [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline]] since the third century AD, the Empire split in two in 395 AD. The [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], under the pressure of the [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]], eventually dissolved in 476 AD, when its last Emperor [[Romulus Augustulus]] was deposed by the Germanic chief [[Odoacer]], while the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] half of the Empire survived for another thousand years.

The invasion of another [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]], the [[Lombards]], late in the same century, reduced the Byzantine presence to the rump realm of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] and started the end of political unity of the peninsula for the next 1,300 years. The Lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the [[Frankish Empire]] by [[Charlemagne]] in the late 8th century. The Franks also helped the formation of the [[Papal States]] in central Italy. Until the 13th century, Italian politics was dominated by the relations between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and the Papacy, with most of the Italian city-states siding with the former ([[Ghibellines]]) or with the latter ([[Guelphs]]) from momentary convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolan|first=Cathal J.|title=The age of wars of religion, 1000–1650 : an encyclopedia of global warfare and civilization|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport (Connecticut)|isbn=978-0-313-33045-2|page=360|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this chaotic era that Italian towns saw the rise of a peculiar institution, the [[medieval commune]].

In 1176 a league of city-states, the [[Lombard League]], defeated the German emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] at the [[Battle of Legnano]], thus ensuring effective independence for most of northern and central Italian cities.

In coastal and southern areas, the [[maritime republics]] grew to eventually dominate the Mediterranean and monopolise trade routes to the [[Orient]]. They were independent thalassocratic city-states, though most of them originated from territories once belonging to the Byzantine Empire. All these cities during the time of their independence had similar systems of government in which the merchant class had considerable power.

The four most prominent maritime republics were [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]].

[[File:Italy 1494.svg|thumb|left|[[List of historic states of Italy#Late Middle Ages|Italian states]] before the beginning of the [[Italian Wars]] in 1494.]]

In the 14th and 15th centuries, northern-central Italy was divided into a number of warring [[Italian city-states|city-states]], the rest of the peninsula being occupied by the larger Papal States and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], referred to here as Naples. Though many of these city-states were often formally subordinate to foreign rulers, as in the case of the [[Duchy of Milan]], which was officially a [[constituent state]] of the mainly Germanic [[Holy Roman Empire]], the city-states generally managed to maintain de facto independence from the foreign sovereigns that had seized Italian lands following the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|collapse]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The strongest among these city-states gradually absorbed the surrounding territories giving birth to the [[Signoria|Signorie]], regional states often led by merchant families which founded local dynasties. War between the city-states was endemic, and primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as ''[[Condottiere|condottieri]]'', bands of soldiers drawn from around Europe, especially Germany and Switzerland, led largely by Italian captains.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Decades of fighting eventually saw [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] emerged as the dominant players that agreed to the [[Peace of Lodi]] in 1454, which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries. This peace would hold for the next forty years.

The [[Renaissance]], a period of vigorous revival of the arts and culture, originated in Italy due to a number of factors: the great wealth accumulated by merchant cities, the [[patronage]] of its dominant families,&lt;ref name="strathern"&gt;Strathern, Paul ''The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and the migration of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholars]] and texts to Italy following the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] at the hands of the [[Ottoman Turks]].&lt;ref name="Britannica1"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Renaissance'', 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Har, Michael H.

The [[Italian Renaissance]] peaked in the mid-16th century as foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the [[Italian Wars]].

Greatest artists like [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Brunelleschi]], [[Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Giotto]], [[Donatello]], [[Titian]] and [[Raphael]] produced inspired works – their paintwork was more realistic-looking than had been created by Medieval artists and their marble statues rivalled and sometimes surpassed those of [[Classical Antiquity]].

The ideas and ideals of the Renaissance soon spread into [[Northern Renaissance|Northern Europe]], [[French Renaissance|France]], [[English Renaissance|England]] and much of Europe. In the meantime, the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovery of the Americas]], the new routes to Asia discovered by the Portuguese and the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], all factors which eroded the traditional Italian dominance in trade with the East, caused a long economic decline in the peninsula.

Following the [[Italian Wars]] (1494 to 1559), ignited by the rivalry between France and Spain, the city-states gradually lost their independence and came under foreign domination, first under [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] (1559 to 1713) and then [[Habsburg Austria|Austria]] (1713 to 1796).

In the 18th century, as a result of the [[War of Spanish Succession]], [[Empire of Austria|Austria]] replaced Spain as the dominant foreign power, while the [[House of Savoy]] emerged as a regional power expanding to [[Piedmont]] and [[Sardinia]]. In the same century, the two-century long decline was interrupted by the economic and state reforms pursued in several states by the ruling élites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galasso|first=Giuseppe|title=Storia d'Italia 1: I caratteri originali|year=1972|publisher=Einaudi| location=Turin|pages=509–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], northern-central Italy was invaded and reorganised as a new [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], a [[client state]] of the [[Napoleonic France|French Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte, "The Economy of the Empire in Italy: Instructions from Napoleon to Eugène, Viceroy of Italy," ''Exploring the European Past: Texts &amp; Images'', Second Edition, ed.

The 1814 [[Congress of Vienna]] restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] could not be eradicated, and soon re-surfaced during the [[political revolution|political upheavals]] that characterised the first part of the 19th century.

=== Italian unification ===

The birth of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the [[House of Savoy]] to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire [[Italian Peninsula]]. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the political and social [[Italian unification]] movement, or ''Risorgimento'', emerged to unite Italy consolidating the different states of the peninsula and liberate it from foreign control. A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], member of the secret revolutionary society ''[[Carbonari]]'' and founder of the influential political movement [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement. His prolific output of propaganda helped the unification movement stay active.

The most famous member of Young Italy was the revolutionary and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], renowned for his extremely loyal followers,&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Mack Smith, ''Modern Italy; A Political History'', (University of Michigan Press, 1997) p. 15. A literary echo may be found in the character of Giorgio Viola in Joseph Conrad's [[Nostromo]].&lt;/ref&gt; who led the Italian republican drive for unification in Southern Italy. However, the Northern Italy monarchy of the House of Savoy in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], whose government was led by [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. In the context of the [[revolutions of 1848|1848 liberal revolutions]] that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful [[First Italian War of Independence|first war of independence]] was declared on [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]. The Kingdom of Sardinia again attacked the Austrian Empire in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] of 1859, with the aid of [[Second French Empire|France]], resulting in liberating [[Lombardy]].

In 1860–1861, Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily (the [[Expedition of the Thousand]]),&lt;ref&gt;Mack Smith, Denis (1997). ''Modern Italy; A Political History''.

[[Teano]] was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860  between Giuseppe Garibaldi and [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], last King of Sardinia, in which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy; thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170317/everything-to-know-about-march-17th-italys-unity-unification-risorgimento-day|title=Everything you need to know about March 17th, Italy's Unity Day|date=2017-03-17|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Emmanuel II then became the first king of a united Italy, and the capital was moved from Turin to Florence.

In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annexe [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] to keep the large Prussian Army at bay, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by [[Capture of Rome|taking over the Papal States]]. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome. After the unification, Victor Emmanuel, Garibaldi, Cavour and Mazzini have been referred as Italy's ''Four Fathers of the Fatherland''.&lt;ref name="scholar and patriot"/&gt;

The new Kingdom of Italy obtained [[Great Power]] status. The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, was extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy participated as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China. On 7 September 1901, a [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession in Tientsin]] was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a [[Consul (representative)|consul]].

In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. As [[Northern Italy]] quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad, while the [[Italian Socialist Party]] constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. The pre-war period dominated by [[Giovanni Giolitti]], Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterized by the economic, industrial and political-cultural modernization of Italian society. Starting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a [[Italian Empire|colonial power]] by forcing [[Italian Somalia|Somalia]], [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and later [[Italian Libya|Libya]] and the [[Italian Dodecanese|Dodecanese]] under its rule.&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth (2005), pp. 49.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy, nominally allied with the [[German Empire]] and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into World War I with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains, that included western [[Inner Carniola]], former [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Dalmatia]] as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the "[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]" top Allied powers. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long [[trench warfare|attrition war]] in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]. The Italian victory&lt;ref&gt;Burgwyn, H.

During the war, more than 650,000 Italian soldiers and as many civilians died&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Salute pubblica in Italia durante e dopo la Guerra|last=Mortara|first=G|year=1925|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the kingdom went to the brink of bankruptcy. Under the Peace Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Rome]], Italy gained a permanent seat in the [[League of Nations]]'s executive council and obtained most of the promised territories, but not Dalmatia (except [[Zadar|Zara]]), allowing nationalists to define the victory as "[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]". Moreover, Italy annexed the Hungarian harbour of [[Rijeka|Fiume]], that was not part of territories promised at London but [[Impresa di Fiume|had been occupied]] after the end of the war by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].

=== Fascist regime ===
{{Main|Italian Fascism|Military history of Italy during World War II}}
[[File:Benito Mussolini colored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benito Mussolini]], ''[[duce]]'' of [[Fascist Italian|Fascist Italy]]]]
The [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party attempted a [[coup d'état|coup]] (the "[[March on Rome]]") which failed but at the last minute, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a [[Totalitarianism|dictatorship]]. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].

In 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]] and founded the [[Italian East Africa]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]; Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish civil war]]. In 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexed Albania]], a ''de facto'' protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. After initially advancing in [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|British Somaliland]], [[Italian invasion of Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]] and eastern fronts, the Italians were defeated in East Africa, [[Italian participation in the Eastern Front|Soviet Union]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]].

The [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], which ended fighting between Italy and Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, resulted in Italian annexation of neighbouring parts of Yugoslavia. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of [[Italianization|Italianisation]] in the areas it annexed, which suppressed Slavic language, schools, political parties, and cultural institutions. During World War II, [[Italian war crimes]] included [[extrajudicial killing]]s and [[ethnic cleansing]]&lt;ref name="JamesBurgwyn_2004"&gt;James H. Burgwyn (2004).

Meanwhile, about 250,000 Italians and anti-communist Slavs fled to Italy in the [[Istrian exodus]].

An [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] began in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini on [[25 Luglio|25 July]]. Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with members of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], who lost faith in him for having led Italy to ruin by allying with Germany. On 8 September, Italy signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], ending its war with the Allies. The Germans helped by the Italian fascists shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battlefield]] for the rest of the war, as the Allies were slowly moving up from the south.

In the north, the Germans set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by German paratroopers. The post-armistice period saw the rise of a large [[anti-fascist]] [[resistance movement]], the ''[[Resistenza]]''. In late April 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Marino|last=Viganò|title=Un'analisi accurata della presunta fuga in Svizzera|journal=Nuova Storia Contemporanea|volume=3|year=2001|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was captured and [[Death of Benito Mussolini|summarly executed]] near [[Lake Como]] by Italian partisans.

The [[Constitution of Italy|Republican Constitution]] was approved on 1 January 1948. Under the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Treaty of Peace with Italy]] of 1947, most of [[Julian March]] was lost to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and, later, the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] was divided between the two states. Italy also lost all of its colonial possessions, formally ending the [[Italian Empire]]. Italian Somaliland was made a [[Trust Territory of Somaliland|United Nations Trust Territory]] under Italian administration until 1 July 1960.

Fears in the Italian electorate of a possible Communist takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on [[Italian general election, 1948|18 April 1948]], when the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], under the leadership of [[Alcide De Gasperi]], obtained a landslide victory. Consequently, in 1949 Italy became a member of [[NATO]]. The [[Marshall Plan]] helped to revive the Italian economy which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the "[[Italian economic miracle|Economic Miracle]]". In 1957, Italy was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), which became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993.

From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]], a period characterised by economic crisis (especially after the [[1973 oil crisis]]), widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups, with the alleged involvement of US and Soviet intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi (Parliamentary investigative commission on terrorism in Italy and the failure to identify the perpetrators) | year=1995 | accessdate=2 May 2006 | url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060819211212/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 19 August 2006|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Docs"&gt;{{en icon}} / {{it icon}} / {{fr icon}} /{{de icon}} {{cite web|title=Secret Warfare: Operation Gladio and NATO's Stay-Behind Armies |accessdate=2 May 2006 |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology / International Relation and Security Network |url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm#Documents |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425182721/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm |archivedate=25 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/us.terrorism_graun_24jun2000.html |title=Clarion: Philip Willan, Guardian, 24 June 2000, page 19 |publisher=Cambridgeclarion.org |date=24 June 2000 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329113138/http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/us.terrorism_graun_24jun2000.html |archivedate=29 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the Christian Democrat leader [[Aldo Moro]] in 1978 and the [[Bologna massacre|Bologna railway station massacre]] in 1980, where 85 people died.

In the 1980s, for the first time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers: one republican ([[Giovanni Spadolini]]) and one socialist ([[Bettino Craxi]]); the Christian Democrats remained, however, the main government party. During Craxi's government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world's fifth largest industrial nation, after it gained the entry into the [[G7]] Group in '70s. However, as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the country's GDP.

In the early 1990s, Italy faced significant challenges, as voters – disenchanted with political paralysis, massive public debt and the extensive corruption system (known as ''[[Tangentopoli]]'') uncovered by the [[Mani pulite|Clean Hands]] investigation – demanded radical reforms. The scandals involved all major parties, but especially those in the government coalition: the Christian Democrats, who ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a severe crisis and eventually disbanded, splitting up into several factions.&lt;ref&gt;The so-called "Second Republic" was born by forceps: not with a revolt of Algiers, but formally under the same Constitution, with the mere replacement of one ruling class to another: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title=Tovaglie pulite|journal=Mondoperaio Edizione Online|date=2015|url=https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89429827|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324160801/https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89429827|archivedate=24 March 2016|df=dmy-all}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communists reorganised as a [[social-democratic]] force. During the 1990s and the 2000s (decade), centre-right (dominated by media magnate [[Silvio Berlusconi]]) and centre-left coalitions (led by university professor [[Romano Prodi]]) alternately governed the country.

In the late 2000s, Italy was severely hit by the [[Great Recession]]. From 2008 to 2013, the country suffered 42 months of GDP recession. The economic crisis was one of the main problems that forced Berlusconi to [[Resignation of Silvio Berlusconi|resign]] in 2011. The government of the conservative Prime Minister was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of [[Mario Monti]]. Following the [[Italian general election, 2013|2013 general election]], the Vice-Secretary of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] [[Enrico Letta]] formed a [[Letta Cabinet|new government]] at the head of a right-left [[Grand coalition (Italy)|Grand coalition]]. In 2014, challenged by the new [[List of Secretaries of the Democratic Party|Secretary]] of the PD [[Matteo Renzi]], Letta resigned and was replaced by Renzi. The new government started important constitutional reforms such as the abolition of the [[Italian Senate|Senate]] and a new electoral law. On 4 December the constitutional reform was rejected in a [[Italian constitutional referendum, 2016|referendum]] and Renzi resigned after few days on 12 December; the Foreign Affairs Minister [[Paolo Gentiloni]] was appointed new Prime Minister.

Italy was affected by the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015 as it became the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU.

{{Main|Geography of Italy}}

[[File:Italy topographic map-blank.svg|thumb|left|Topographic map of Italy]]
Italy is located in [[Southern Europe]], between latitudes [[35th parallel north|35°]] and [[47th parallel north|47° N]], and longitudes [[6th meridian east|6°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]]. To the north, Italy borders [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]], and is roughly delimited by the [[Alps|Alpine watershed]], enclosing the [[Po Valley]] and the [[Venetian Plain]]. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the two [[Mediterranean islands]] of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]], in addition to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]] are [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] within Italy, while [[Campione d'Italia]] is an Italian [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] in Switzerland.

The country's total area is {{convert|301230|km²|0|abbr=out}}, of which {{convert|294020|km²|0|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|7210|km²|0|abbr=on}} is water.

Although the country includes the Italian peninsula, adjacent islands and most of the southern Alpine basin, some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the [[Eurasia]]n continental shelf. These territories are the ''comuni'' of: [[Livigno]], [[Sexten]], [[Innichen]], [[Toblach]] (in part), [[Chiusaforte]], [[Tarvisio]], [[Graun im Vinschgau]] (in part), which are all part of the [[Danube#Drainage basin|Danube's drainage basin]], while the [[Lago di Lei|Val di Lei]] constitutes part of the [[Rhine]]'s basin and the islands of [[Lampedusa]] and [[Lampione]] are on the African [[continental shelf]].

=== Volcanology ===
{{see also|Volcanology of Italy}}
[[File:Mt Etna and Catania1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Mount Etna]] is an active stratovolcano in Sicily.]]
The country is situated at the meeting point of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate, leading to considerable [[List of earthquakes in Italy|seismic]] and [[Volcanism in Italy|volcanic activity]]. There are [[List of volcanoes in Italy|14 volcanoes in Italy]], four of which are active: [[Mount Etna|Etna]] (the traditional site of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]'s smithy), [[Stromboli]], [[Vulcano]] and [[Vesuvius]]. The latter one is the only active volcano in mainland Europe and is most famous for the destruction of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculanum]] in the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption in 79 AD]]. Several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity, and there is still a large active [[caldera]], the [[Campi Flegrei]] north-west of Naples.

The high volcanic and magmatic neogenic activity is subdivided into provinces:
* Magmatic Tuscan ([[Monti Cimini]], [[Tolfa]] and [[Amiata]]);
* Magmatic Latium ([[Monti Volsini]], [[Vico nel Lazio]], [[Colli Albani]], [[Roccamonfina]]);
[[File:Vesuvius from Monte Somma (Panorama II).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Mount Vesuvius]], as seen from the [[Mount Somma]].]]
* Ultra-alkaline Umbrian Latium District ([[San Venanzo]], Cupaello and [[Polino]]);
* Vulcanic bell (Vesuvius, [[Campi Flegrei]], [[Ischia]]);
* Windy arch and Tyrrhenian basin ([[Aeolian Islands]] and Tyrrhenian [[seamounts]]);
* African-Adriatic Avampa ([[Channel of Sicily]], [[Graham Island (Mediterranean Sea)|Graham Island]], Etna and [[Mount Vulture]]).&lt;ref name=Scro&gt;{{cite|Scrocca et al.||cidScro}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1950s, Italy was the first and only country to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity in the [[Larderello]] area, and later in the [[Mount Amiata]] area. The high geothermal gradient that forms part of the peninsula makes potentially exploitable also other provinces: research carried out in the 1960s and 1970s identifies potential geothermal fields in Lazio and Tuscany, as well as in most volcanic islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventario delle risorse geotermiche nazionali|publisher=UNMIG|date=2011|url=http://unmig.sviluppoeconomico.gov.it/unmig/geotermia/inventario/inventario.asp|accessdate=14 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722034736/http://unmig.sviluppoeconomico.gov.it/unmig/geotermia/inventario/inventario.asp|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity, while because of rising water levels, [[Venice]] has been regularly flooded throughout recent years. Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas, as in the case of the [[Seveso disaster]]. The country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but, after the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and a [[Italian nuclear power referendum, 1987|referendum on the issue]] the nuclear programme was terminated, a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008, planning to build up to four nuclear power plants with French technology.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Italy}}
[[File:Isola di Levanzo, Sicilia, Italia.jpg|thumb|[[Southern Italy]] has a Mediterranean climate ([[Levanzo]] island pictured).]]

Because of the great longitudinal extension of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous internal conformation, the climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Rigutti, ''Meteorologia'', Giunti, p. 95, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Blair, ''Climatology: General and Regional'', Prentice Hall pages 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;

The coastal areas of [[Liguria]], [[Tuscany]] and most of the [[Southern Italy|South]] generally fit the [[Mediterranean climate]] stereotype ([[Köppen climate classification]] Csa). Conditions on peninsular coastal areas can be very different from the interior's higher ground and valleys, particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer. Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to
{{convert|12|C}} in Sicily, like so the average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C}} to over {{convert|25|C}}. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south. Summers can be hot and humid across the country, particularly in the south while northern and central areas can experience occasional strong thunderstorms from spring to autumn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Atlas of Italy|url=http://clima.meteoam.it/atlanteClimatico.php?ling=eng|publisher=Network of the Air Force Meteorological Service|accessdate=30 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114223307/http://clima.meteoam.it/atlanteClimatico.php?ling=eng|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Italy}}

Italy has been a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] since 2 June 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by a [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|constitutional referendum]]. The [[President of Italy]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Sergio Mattarella]] since 2015, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] and some regional voters in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Howard McGaw Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943–1946) ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205–222), September 1948.{{jstor|442274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy has a parliamentary government based on a mixed [[proportional representation|proportional]] and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]], have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister  has to pass also eventual further votes of confindence or no confidence in Parliament.

The prime minister is the President of the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]—which holds effective executive power— and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]].

Another difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html|title=About us – Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica|website=www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329090926/http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]]. In addition, the Italian Senate is characterised also by a small number of [[senator for life|senators for life]], appointed by the President "for outstanding patriotic merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field". Former Presidents of the Republic are ''ex officio'' life senators.

Italy's three major political parties are the [[Five Star Movement]], the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Lega Nord|Lega]]. During the 2018 general election these three parties won 614 out of 630 seats available in the Chamber of Deputies and 309 out of 315 in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20180321/italy-new-parliament|title=Italy's new parliament is younger, more diverse and more female|date=21 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi's [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] which formed a centre-right coalition with Matteo Salvini's [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]] and Giorgia Meloni's [[Brothers of Italy]] won most of the seats without getting the majority in parliament.  The rest of the seats were taken by [[Five Star Movement]], Matteo Renzi's [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] along with Achammer and Panizza's [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] &amp; [[Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party]] in a centre-left coalition and the independent [[Free and Equal (Italy)|Free and Equal]] party.

=== Law and criminal justice ===

[[File:Courthouse facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|The [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]]]]

The Italian judicial system is based on [[Roman law]] modified by the [[Napoleonic code]] and later statutes. The [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]] is the highest court in Italy for both criminal and civil appeal cases. The [[Constitutional Court of Italy]] (''Corte Costituzionale'') rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and is a post–World War II innovation. Since their appearance in the middle of the 19th century, [[Organized crime in Italy|Italian organised crime]] and criminal organisations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in [[Southern Italy]], the most notorious of which being the [[Sicilian Mafia]], which would later expand into some foreign countries including the United States.

==== Law enforcement ====
{{Main|Law enforcement in Italy}}
[[File:Alfa-Romeo159-Carabinieri-di-Roma.JPG|thumbnail|An [[Alfa Romeo]] vehicle of the [[Carabinieri]] corps]]

Law enforcement in Italy is provided by multiple police forces, five of which are national, Italian agencies.
The [[Polizia di Stato]] (State Police) is the civil national police of Italy. Along with patrolling, investigative and law enforcement duties, it oversees the security of transportations. The [[Carabinieri]] is the common name for the Arma dei Carabinieri, a [[Gendarmerie]] that also serves as the military police for the Italian armed forces.

The [[Guardia di Finanza]], (English: Financial Guard) is a corps under the authority of the Minister of Economy and Finance, with a role as police force. The Corps controls financial, economic, judiciary and public safety.
The Polizia Penitenziaria (Prison Guards, literally Penitentiary Police) operate the Italian prison system and handle the transportation of inmates.

[[File:G7 Taormina family photo 2017-05-26.jpg|thumb|Group photo of the [[Group of Seven|G7]] leaders at the [[43rd G7 summit]] in [[Taormina]]]]
Italy is a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), now the [[European Union]] (EU), and of [[NATO]]. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and it is a member and a strong supporter of a wide number of international organisations, such as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]/[[World Trade Organization]] (GATT/WTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Central European Initiative]]. Its recent or upcoming turns in the rotating presidency of international organisations include the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 2018, the [[G7]] in 2017 and the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU Council]] from July to December 2014. Italy is also a recurrent [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|non-permanent member]] of the [[UN Security Council]], the most recently in 2017.

Italy strongly supports multilateral international politics, endorsing the United Nations and its [[international security]] activities. {{As of|2013}}, Italy was deploying 5,296 troops abroad, engaged in 33 UN and NATO missions in 25 countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MISSIONI/ATTIVITA' INTERNAZIONALI DAL 1 October 2013 AL 31 December 2013 – SITUAZIONE AL 11.12.2013|url=http://www.difesa.it/OperazioniMilitari/Documents/SIT%20ANNO%202013%20al%2011%20dicembre%202013.pdf|publisher=Italian Ministry of Defence|accessdate=27 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175427/http://www.difesa.it/OperazioniMilitari/Documents/SIT%20ANNO%202013%20al%2011%20dicembre%202013.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in [[UNITAF|Somalia]], [[United Nations Operation in Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor|East Timor]] and provides support for NATO and UN operations in [[IFOR|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo Force|Kosovo]] and [[Operation Sunrise (Albania)|Albania]]. Italy deployed over 2,000 troops in [[Afghanistan]] in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF) from February 2003.

Italy supported international efforts to reconstruct and stabilise [[Iraq]], but it had withdrawn its [[Multi-National Force – Iraq#2006 withdrawals|military contingent]] of some 3,200 troops by 2006, maintaining only humanitarian operators and other civilian personnel.

Through the centuries, Italy has fostered the scientific community that produced many major discoveries in physics and the other sciences. During the [[Renaissance]] Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–72) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]].&lt;br&gt;
Other astronomers suchs as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625–1712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835–1910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]. In mathematics, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736–1813) was active before leaving Italy. [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 – c. 1250), and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501–76) made fundamental advances in mathematics. [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world. Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901–54), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and was one of the key figures in the creation of the [[nuclear weapon]]. He, [[Emilio G. Segrè]] (1905–89) who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]), [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905–93) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]],.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Orlando, "Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the" New Tasks" of Physics in Italy."

Other prominent physicists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular the [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Antonio Pacinotti]], pioneers of the induction motor, [[Alessandro Cruto]], pioneer of light bulb and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, [[Ettore Majorana]] (who discovered the [[Majorana fermion]]s), [[Carlo Rubbia]] (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the [[W and Z particles]] at [[CERN]]).

In chemistry, [[Giulio Natta]] received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963 for his work on high [[polymers]]. [[Giuseppe Occhialini]] received the [[Wolf Prize in Physics]] for the discovery of the [[pion]] or pi-[[meson]] decay in 1947.

However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia are very sparsely populated.

The population of Italy almost doubled during the 20th century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven because of large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the [[Italian economic miracle]] of the 1950–1960s. High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they start decline. The population rapidly [[population ageing|aged]].

The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 87% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 13% live in the southern half of the peninsula.

Because of recent immigration influx, Italy has sizeable populations whose native language is not Italian, nor a regional language. According to the [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Italian National Institute of Statistics]], [[Romanian people|Romanian]] is the most common mother tongue among foreign residents in Italy: almost 800,000 people speak Romanian as their first language (21.9% of the foreign residents aged 6 and over). Other prevalent mother tongues are [[Arabic]] (spoken by over 475,000 people; 13.1% of foreign residents), [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (380,000 people) and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (255,000 people).

The [[Holy See]], the [[Diocese of Rome|episcopal jurisdiction of Rome]], contains the central government of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It is recognised by other subjects of international law as a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] entity, headed by the [[Pope]], who is also the [[Bishop of Rome]], with which [[diplomatic relations]] can be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Text taken directly from {{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/europe/holy-see/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231084624/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/europe/holy-see/ |archivedate=31 December 2010 |df= }} (viewed on 14 December 2011), on the website of the British Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Holy See's sovereignty has been recognized explicitly in many international agreements and is particularly emphasized in article 2 of the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 11 February 1929, in which "Italy recognizes the sovereignty of the Holy See in international matters as an inherent attribute in conformity with its traditions and the requirements of its mission to the world" ([http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/treaty.htm Lateran Treaty, English translation]).&lt;/ref&gt; Often incorrectly referred to as "the Vatican", the Holy See is not the same entity as the [[Vatican City]] State, which came into existence only in 1929.

One of the longest-established minority religious faiths in Italy is [[Italian Jews|Judaism]], Jews having been present in [[Ancient Rome]] since before the birth of Christ. Italy has for centuries welcomed Jews expelled from other countries, notably Spain. However, as a result of the [[Holocaust]], about 20% of Italian Jews lost their lives.&lt;ref name=isbn0553343025&gt;{{cite book|author=Dawidowicz, Lucy S.|title=The war against the Jews, 1933–1945|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|year=1986|isbn=978-0-553-34302-1}}p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed World War II, has left only around 28,400 Jews in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OF ITALY Unione delle Comunita Ebraiche Italiane|url=http://www.eurojewcong.org/communities/italy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313095857/http://www.eurojewcong.org/communities/italy.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 March 2013|publisher=The European Jewish Congress|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian state, as a measure to protect religious freedom, devolves shares of income tax to recognised religious communities, under a regime known as [[Eight per thousand]]. Donations are allowed to Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu communities; however, Islam remains excluded, since no Muslim communities have yet signed a concordat with the Italian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Religion/?id=3.1.880028077 |title=Italy: Islam denied income tax revenue – Adnkronos Religion |publisher=Adnkronos.com |date=7 April 2003 |accessdate=2 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620070907/http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Religion/?id=3.1.880028077 |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taxpayers who do not wish to fund a religion contribute their share to the state welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documenti.camera.it/Leg16/dossier/Testi/BI0350.htm#_Toc278992388 Camera dei deputati Dossier BI0350] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927211619/http://documenti.camera.it/Leg16/dossier/Testi/BI0350.htm |date=27 September 2013 }}.

Primary education lasts eight years. Students are given a basic education in Italian, English, mathematics, natural sciences, history, geography, social studies, physical education and visual and musical arts. Secondary education lasts for five years and includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the ''[[Secondary education in Italy#liceo|liceo]]'' prepares students for university studies with a classical or scientific curriculum, while the ''[[istituto tecnico]]'' and the ''[[Istituto professionale]]'' prepare pupils for vocational education.

For centuries divided by politics and geography until its eventual unification in 1861, Italy's culture has been shaped by a multitude of regional customs and local centres of power and [[patronage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Killinger|first=Charles|title=Culture and customs of Italy|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-32489-5|page=3|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy had a central role in Western culture for centuries and is still recognised for its cultural traditions and artists. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a number of magnificent [[Court (royal)|courts]] competed for attracting the best architects, artists and scholars, thus producing a great legacy of monuments, paintings, music and literature. Despite the political and social isolation of these courts, Italy's contribution to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe and the world remain immense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Alison|title=Virtue and magnificence : art of the Italian Renaissance courts|year=1995|publisher=H.N.

Italy has more [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|World Heritage Sites]] ([[Table of World Heritage Sites by country|54]]) than any other country in the world, and has rich collections of art, culture and literature from many periods. The country has had a broad cultural influence worldwide, also because numerous Italians emigrated to other places during the [[Italian diaspora]]. Furthermore, Italy has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (museums, palaces, buildings, statues, churches, art galleries, villas, fountains, historic houses and archaeological remains),&lt;ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2005, pg. 19"&gt;Eyewitness Travel (2005), pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and according to some estimates the nation is home to half the world's great art treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbot |first=Charles |date= 2006|title= Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGuWGa48iQMC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;f |publisher=Morellini Editore |page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Architecture of Italy}}
Italy has a very broad and diverse architectural style, which cannot be simply classified by period, but also by region, because of Italy's division into several regional states until 1861. This has created a highly diverse and eclectic range in architectural designs.

Italy is known for its considerable architectural achievements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/italy-architecture.asp Architecture in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115053940/http://www.justitaly.org/italy/italy-architecture.asp |date=15 January 2012 }}, ItalyTravel.com&lt;/ref&gt; such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structures during [[ancient Rome]], the founding of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance architectural movement]] in the late-14th to 16th centuries, and being the homeland of [[Palladianism]], a style of construction which inspired movements such as that of [[Neoclassical architecture]], and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world, notably in the UK, Australia and the US during the late 17th to early 20th centuries. Several of the finest works in Western architecture, such as the [[Colosseum]], the [[Milan Cathedral]] and [[Florence cathedral]], the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and the building designs of [[Venice]] are found in Italy.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Italian architecture has also widely influenced the architecture of the world. British architect [[Inigo Jones]], inspired by the designs of Italian buildings and cities, brought back the ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture to 17th-century England, being inspired by [[Andrea Palladio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/jones_inigo.shtml |title=History – Historic Figures: Inigo Jones (1573–1652) |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821112543/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/jones_inigo.shtml |archivedate=21 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Italianate architecture]], popular abroad since the 19th century, was used to describe foreign architecture which was built in an Italian style, especially modelled on [[Renaissance architecture]].

=== Visual art ===
{{Main|Art of Italy}}

The history of Italian visual art is one of the most important parts of [[Western painting]] history. [[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726163006/http://art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |archivedate=26 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons. Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]]. From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.

[[File:Michelangelo's David 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.9|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' (1501–1504), [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], Florence]]

The [[Italian Renaissance]] is said by many to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Giorgione]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], [[Luca Della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].

[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' (1484-86), [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]], Florence]]

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylised art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. In the 17th century, among the greatest painters of [[Italian Baroque]] are [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]. Subsequently, in the 18th century, [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]]. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with [[Antonio Canova]]'s nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.

In the 19th century, major Italian [[Romantic painting|Romantic]] painters were [[Francesco Hayez]], [[Giuseppe Bezzuoli]] and [[Francesco Podesti]]. [[Impressionism]] was brought from France to Italy by the ''[[Macchiaioli]]'', led by [[Giovanni Fattori]], and [[Giovanni Boldini]]; [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] by [[Gioacchino Toma]] and [[Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo]]. In the 20th century, with [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of [[Giorgio de Chirico]], who exerted a strong influence on the [[Surrealists]] and generations of artists to follow.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Literature of Italy}}

Italian literature began after the founding of Rome in 753 BC. Latin literature was, and still is, highly influential in the world, with numerous writers, poets, philosophers, and historians, such as [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Propertius]], [[Ovid]] and [[Livy]]. The Romans were also famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama and epigrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=''Poetry and Drama: Literary Terms and Concepts.''|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|date=2011|url={{Google books|LHA_SydyKOYC|page=PA39|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=18 October 2011|isbn=9781615304905}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early years of the 13th century, St. [[Francis of Assisi]] was considered the first Italian poet by literary critics, with his religious song ''[[Canticle of the Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter=2 – Poetry.

[[File:DanteDetail.jpg|thumb|[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], poised between the mountain of [[Purgatory]] and the city of Florence, displays the famous incipit "''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita"'' of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' in a detail of [[Domenico di Michelino]]'s painting, 1465]]

Another Italian voice originated in Sicily. At the court of Emperor Frederick II, who ruled the Sicilian kingdom during the first half of the 13th century, lyrics modelled on Provençal forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. The most important of these poets was the notary [[Giacomo da Lentini]], inventor of the [[sonnet]] form, though the most famous early sonneteer was [[Petrarch]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Hatch Wilkins, ''The invention of the sonnet, and other studies in Italian literature'' (Rome: Edizioni di Storia e letteratura, 1959), 11–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guido Guinizelli]] is considered the founder of the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'', a school that added a philosophical dimension to traditional love poetry. This new understanding of love, expressed in a smooth, pure style, influenced [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and the [[Florence|Florentine]] poet [[Dante Alighieri]], who established the basis of the modern [[Italian language]]; his greatest work, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', is considered among the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]; furthermore, the poet invented the difficult ''[[terza rima]]''. The two great writers of the 14th century, Petrarch and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], sought out and imitated the works of antiquity and cultivated their own artistic personalities. Petrarch achieved fame through his collection of poems, ''[[Il Canzoniere]]''. Petrarch's love poetry served as a model for centuries. Equally influential was Boccaccio's ''[[The Decameron]]'', one of the most popular collections of short stories ever written.&lt;ref name=Britannica-Shakespeare&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Giovanni Boccaccio: The Decameron.| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| location = | date = | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70836/Giovanni-Boccaccio/755/The-Decameron| accessdate = 18 December 2013| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131219020413/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70836/Giovanni-Boccaccio/755/The-Decameron| archivedate = 19 December 2013| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.8|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], founder of the modern political science and ethics]]

Italian Renaissance authors produced a number of important works. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' is one of the world's most famous essays on political science and modern philosophy, in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. Another important work of the period, [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', continuation of [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]'s unfinished romance ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'', is perhaps the greatest chivalry poem ever written. [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s dialogue ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' describes the ideal of the perfect court gentleman and of spiritual beauty. The lyric poet [[Torquato Tasso]] in ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' wrote a Christian epic, making use of the ''[[ottava rima]]'', with attention to the Aristotelian canons of unity.

[[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] and [[Giambattista Basile]], which have written ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' (1550–1555) and the ''[[Pentamerone]]'' (1634) respectively, printed some of the first known versions of fairy tales in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Swann Jones, ''The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of Imagination'', Twayne Publishers, New York, 1995, {{ISBN|0-8057-0950-9}}, p38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bottigheimer 2012a, 7; Waters 1894, xii; Zipes 2015, 599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Opie |first=Iona |authorlink2=Peter Opie| first2 =Peter|last2 = Opie |authorlink=Iona Opie |title=The Classic Fairy Tales |location=Oxford and New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=1974 |isbn=978-0-19-211559-1}} See page 20. The claim for earliest fairy-tale is still debated, see for example Jan M. Ziolkowski, ''Fairy tales from before fairy tales: the medieval Latin past of wonderful lies'', University of Michigan Press, 2007. Ziolkowski examines [[Egbert of Liège]]'s Latin beast poem ''Fecunda natis'' (''The Richly Laden Ship'', c. 1022/24), the earliest known version of "[[Little Red Riding Hood]]".

Leithart, 9 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 17th century, some literary masterpieces were created, such as [[Giambattista Marino]]'s long mythological poem, ''[[Giambattista Marino#L'Adone|L'Adone]]''. The Baroque period also produced the clear scientific prose of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] as well as [[Tommaso Campanella]]'s ''[[The City of the Sun]]'', a description of a perfect society ruled by a philosopher-priest. At the end of the 17th century, the [[Academy of Arcadia|Arcadians]] began a movement to restore simplicity and classical restraint to poetry, as in [[Metastasio]]'s heroic melodramas. In the 18th century, playwright [[Carlo Goldoni]] created full written plays, many portraying the middle class of his day.

The Romanticism coincided with some ideas of the ''[[Risorgimento]]'', the patriotic movement that brought Italy political unity and freedom from foreign domination. Italian writers embraced Romanticism in the early 19th century. The time of Italy's rebirth was heralded by the poets [[Vittorio Alfieri]], [[Ugo Foscolo]], and [[Giacomo Leopardi]]. The works by [[Alessandro Manzoni]], the leading Italian Romantic, are a symbol of the Italian unification for their patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of the modern, unified Italian language; his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' was the first Italian historical novel to glorify Christian values of justice and Providence, and it has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language.&lt;ref name="Archibald Colquhoun 1954"&gt;Archibald Colquhoun.

In the late 19th century, a realistic literary movement called ''[[Verismo (literature)|Verismo]]'' played a major role in Italian literature; [[Giovanni Verga]] and [[Luigi Capuana]] were its main exponents. In the same period, [[Emilio Salgari]], writer of action adventure [[swashbuckler]]s and a pioneer of science fiction, published his ''[[Sandokan]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gaetana Marrone|author2=Paolo Puppa|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|url={{Google books|d9NcAgAAQBAJ|page=PA1654|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45530-9|page=1654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, [[Carlo Collodi]] also published the novel ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', the most celebrated children's classic by an Italian author and the most translated non-religious book in the world.&lt;ref name=Gasparini&gt;Giovanni Gasparini. ''La corsa di Pinocchio''. Milano, Vita e Pensiero, 1997. p. 117. {{ISBN|88-343-4889-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A movement called [[Futurism]] influenced Italian literature in the early 20th century. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] wrote ''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]'', called for the use of language and metaphors that glorified the speed, dynamism, and violence of the machine age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=dsdLondon|isbn=978-0714835426|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. As with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists was heavily influenced or tended to adapt from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre and Drama in the Making|last=Gassner|first=John |publisher=Applause Theatre Books|year=1992|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.  Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called [[lazzi]], which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The characters of the ''commedia'' usually represent fixed social types and [[stock character]]s, each of which has a distinct [[Costumes in commedia dell'arte|costume]], such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false [[bravery|bravado]]. The main categories of these characters include servants, old men, lovers, and captains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Companion to Commedia Dell'Arte|author1=Chaffee, Judith |author2=Crick, Olly|publisher=Rutledge Taylor and Francis Group|year=2015|isbn=978-0-415-74506-2|location=London and New York|page=1|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlo Goldoni]], who wrote a few scenarios starting in 1734, supersed the comedy of masks and the comedy of intrigue by representations of actual life and manners through the characters and their behaviours. He rightly maintained that Italian life and manners were susceptible of artistic treatment such as had not been given them before.

The [[Teatro di San Carlo]] in Naples is the oldest continuously active venue for public opera in the world, opening in 1737, decades before both the Milan's [[La Scala]] and Venice's [[La Fenice]] theatres.&lt;ref name=SanCarlo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teatrosancarlo.it/teatro/il?_locale|title=The Theatre and its history|publisher=Teatro di San Carlo's official website|date=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Italian folk music|folk music]] to [[European classical music|classical]], music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=978-0-19-816171-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Edward Heron|title=Violin-making, as it was and is: Being a Historical, Theoretical, and Practical Treatise on the Science and Art of Violin-making, for the Use of Violin Makers and Players, Amateur and Professional.

Italy's most famous composers include the [[List of Renaissance composers#Italian|Renaissance composers]] [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]] and [[Carlo Gesualdo|Gesualdo]], the [[List of Baroque composers|Baroque composers]] [[Domenico Scarlatti|Scarlatti]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], the [[List of Classical era composers|Classical composers]] [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]], [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], and the [[List of Romantic-era composers|Romantic composers]] [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]. Modern Italian composers such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Nono]] proved significant in the development of [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[electronic music]]. While the classical music tradition still holds strong in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its innumerable opera houses, such as ''[[La Scala]]'' of Milan and ''[[Teatro di San Carlo|San Carlo]]'' of Naples (the oldest continuously active venue for public opera in the world),&lt;ref name=SanCarlo/&gt; and performers such as the pianist [[Maurizio Pollini]] and tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]], Italians have been no less appreciative of their thriving contemporary music scene.

La Scala operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous Italian opera singers include [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Alessandro Bonci]].

Introduced in the early 1920s, [[jazz]] took a particularly strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centres of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the [[progressive rock]] and pop movement of the 1970s, with bands like [[Premiata Forneria Marconi|PFM]], [[Banco del Mutuo Soccorso]], [[Le Orme]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], and [[Pooh (band)|Pooh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Keller, Catalano and Colicci |title=Garland Encyclopedia of World Music |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gh03DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1022&amp;lpg=PT1022&amp;q=keller%20catalano%20and%20colicci |pages= 604–625|isbn=9781351544269 |date=2017-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same period saw diversification in the [[cinema of Italy]], and [[Cinecittà]] films included complex scores by composers including [[Ennio Morricone]], [[Armando Trovaioli]], [[Piero Piccioni]] and [[Piero Umiliani]].

Italy was also an important country in the development of [[disco]] and [[electronic music]], with [[Italo disco]], known for its futuristic sound and prominent use of synthesisers and [[drum machine]]s, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco aside from [[Euro disco]] (which later went on to influence several genres such as [[Eurodance]] and [[Nu-disco]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scene and heard: Italo-disco|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/01/sceneandhearditalodisco|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=14 July 2012|location=London|first=John|last=McDonnell|date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By circa 1988, the genre had merged into other forms of European dance and electronic music, such as [[Italo house]], which blended elements of Italo disco with traditional house music; its sound was generally uplifting, and made strong usage of piano melodies. Some bands of this genre are [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]], [[East Side Beat]], and [[49ers (band)|49ers]]. By the latter half of the 1990s, a subgenre of Eurodance known as [[Italo dance]] emerged. Taking influences from Italo disco and Italo house, Italo dance generally included synthesizer riffs, a melodic sound, and the usage of vocoders. Notable Italian DJs and remixers include [[Gabry Ponte]] (member of the group [[Eiffel 65]]), [[Benny Benassi]], [[Gigi D'Agostino]], and the trio [[Tacabro]].

Producers such as [[Giorgio Moroder]], who won three [[Academy Award]]s and four [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] for his music, were highly influential in the development of [[electronic dance music]].&lt;ref name=Moroder/&gt; Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the [[Sanremo Music Festival]], which served as inspiration for the [[Eurovision]] song contest, and the [[Festival of Two Worlds]] in [[Spoleto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/7817 | publisher = www.esctoday.com | accessdate =18 August 2011 | title = Sanremo Music Festival kicks off tonight | date = 27 February 2007 | author = Yiorgos Kasapoglou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singers such as [[Mina (singer)|Mina]], [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Grammy]] winner [[Laura Pausini]], [[Zucchero Fornaciari|Zucchero]], [[Eros Ramazzotti]] and [[Tiziano Ferro]] have attained international acclaim.

=== Cinema ===
{{Main|Cinema of Italy}}
The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian film was a few seconds, showing [[Pope Leo XIII]] giving a blessing to the camera. The Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the Società Italiana Cines, the [[Ambrosio Film]] and the Itala Film. Other companies soon followed in Milan and in Naples. In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy. Cinema was later used by [[Benito Mussolini]], who founded Rome's renowned [[Cinecittà]] studio for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/italians/resources/Amiciprize/1996/mussolini.html |title=The Cinema Under Mussolini |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |accessdate=30 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731200507/http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/italians/resources/Amiciprize/1996/mussolini.html |archivedate=31 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Italian film was widely recognised and exported until an artistic decline around the 1980s. [[List of film directors from Italy|Notable Italian film directors]] from this period include [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Sergio Leone]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Luchino Visconti]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Roberto Rossellini]]; some of these are recognised among the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Bicycle Thief / Bicycle Thieves (1949)|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990319/REVIEWS08/903190306/1023|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=8 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rMY1F7y2?url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19990319%2FREVIEWS08%2F903190306%2F1023|archivedate=20 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/the-25-most-influential-directors-of-all-time-3358/|title=The 25 Most Influential Directors of All Time|work=MovieMaker Magazine|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211230213/http://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/the-25-most-influential-directors-of-all-time-3358|archivedate=11 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-most-influential-directors-of-all-time.php/2|title=10 Most Influential Directors Of All Time|work=WhatCulture.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121112410/http://whatculture.com/film/10-most-influential-directors-of-all-time.php/2|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movies include world cinema treasures such as ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[La dolce vita]]'', ''[[8½]]'', ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]''.

[[File:Cinecittà - Entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to [[Cinecittà]] in Rome, the largest film studio in Europe]]

As the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism known as pink neorealism succeeded, and other [[film genre]]s, such as [[sword-and-sandal]] followed as [[spaghetti western]]s, were popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Actresses such as [[Sophia Loren]], [[Giulietta Masina]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]] achieved international stardom during this period. Erotic Italian thrillers, or ''[[giallo]]s'', produced by directors such as [[Mario Bava]] and [[Dario Argento]] in the 1970s, also influenced the horror genre worldwide. In recent years, the Italian scene has received only occasional international attention, with movies like ''[[Life Is Beautiful]]'' directed by [[Roberto Benigni]], ''[[Il Postino: The Postman]]'' with [[Massimo Troisi]] and ''[[The Great Beauty]]'' directed by [[Paolo Sorrentino]].

The aforementioned [[Cinecittà]] studio is today the largest film and television production facility in continental Europe and the centre of the Italian cinema, where a large number of biggest box office hits are filmed, and one of the biggest production communities in the world. In the 1950s, the number of international productions being made there led to Rome's being dubbed "''[[Hollywood on the Tiber]]''". More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot, of which 90 received an [[Academy Award]] nomination and 47 of these won it, from some cinema classics to recent rewarded features (such as ''[[Roman Holiday]]'', ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'', ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', and ''[[Gangs of New York]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Italian Cinema: From Neorealism to the Present|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Italian_cinema.html?id=PiTBFMc7tp4C|publisher = Continuum|date = 2001|isbn = 9780826412478|language = en|first = Peter E.|last = Bondanella|page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy is also prominent in the field of design, notably interior design, [[architectural design]], [[industrial design]] and [[urban design]]. The country has produced some well-known furniture designers, such as [[Gio Ponti]] and [[Ettore Sottsass]], and Italian phrases such as ''"Bel Disegno"'' and ''"Linea Italiana"'' have entered the vocabulary of furniture design.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2005) p. 486&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of classic pieces of Italian [[white goods]] and pieces of furniture include [[Zanussi]]'s [[washing machine]]s and [[fridge]]s,&lt;ref name="Insight Guides 2004 p.220"&gt;Insight Guides (2004) p.220&lt;/ref&gt; the "New Tone" sofas by Atrium,&lt;ref name="Insight Guides 2004 p.220"/&gt; and the post-modern bookcase by Ettore Sottsass, inspired by [[Bob Dylan]]'s song "[[Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again]]".&lt;ref name="Insight Guides 2004 p.220"/&gt; Today, [[Milan]] and [[Turin]] are the nation's leaders in [[architectural design]] and [[industrial design]].

[[File:Italian food.JPG|thumb|Some of the most popular Italian foods: [[pizza]] ([[Pizza Margherita|Margherita]]), [[pasta]] ([[Carbonara]]), [[espresso]], and [[gelato]]]]

The Italian [[cuisine]] has developed through centuries of social and political changes, with [[Ancient Roman cuisine|roots]] as far back as the 4th century BC. Italian cuisine in itself takes heavy influences, including [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Ancient Greek cuisine|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient Roman cuisine|ancient Roman]], [[Byzantine cuisine|Byzantine]], and [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inmamaskitchen.com/ITALIAN_COOKING/rome_Lazio/Rome_LAZIO.html |title=Italian Cooking: History of Food and Cooking in Rome and Lazio Region, Papal Influence, Jewish Influence, The Essence of Roman Italian Cooking |publisher=Inmamaskitchen.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410100532/http://www.inmamaskitchen.com/ITALIAN_COOKING/rome_Lazio/Rome_LAZIO.html |archivedate=10 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the [[New World]] with the introduction of items such as [[potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[bell pepper]]s and [[maize]], now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epicurean.com/articles/making-of-italian-food.html |title=The Making of Italian Food...From the Beginning |publisher=Epicurean.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327080045/http://www.epicurean.com/articles/making-of-italian-food.html |archivedate=27 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 11–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Related Articles |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/718430/Italian-cuisine |title=Italian cuisine – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2 January 2009 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716014306/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/718430/Italian-cuisine |archivedate=16 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indigoguide.com/italy/food.htm |title=Italian Food – Italy's Regional Dishes &amp; Cuisine |publisher=Indigoguide.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102020059/http://www.indigoguide.com/italy/food.htm |archivedate=2 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rusticocooking.com/regions.htm |title=Regional Italian Cuisine |publisher=Rusticocooking.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410072851/http://www.rusticocooking.com/regions.htm |archivedate=10 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; abundance of difference in taste, and is known to be one of the most popular in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/eat/worlds-best-food-cultures-453528 |title=Which country has the best food? |publisher=CNN |date=6 January 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629071154/http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/eat/worlds-best-food-cultures-453528 |archivedate=29 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; wielding strong influence abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Freeman |first=Nancy |url=http://www.sallybernstein.com/food/cuisines/us/ |title=American Food, Cuisine |publisher=Sallybernstein.com |date=2 March 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418064119/http://sallybernstein.com/food/cuisines/us/ |archivedate=18 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mediterranean diet]] forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in [[pasta]], fish, fruits and vegetables and characterised by its extreme simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;The Silver Spoon {{ISBN|88-7212-223-6}}, 1997 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Batali Simple Italian Food: Recipes from My Two Villages (1998), {{ISBN|0-609-60300-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dishes and recipes are often derivatives from local and familial tradition rather than created by [[chef]]s, so many recipes are ideally suited for [[home cooking]], this being one of the main reasons behind the ever-increasing worldwide popularity of Italian cuisine, from America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Americans Have Dined Outin the Past Month and, Among Type of Cuisine, American Food is Tops Followed by Italian|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/HarrisPoll18-DiningOut_4-3-13.pdf|publisher=[[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris interactive]]|accessdate=31 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520205539/http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/HarrisPoll18-DiningOut_4-3-13.pdf|archivedate=20 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kazmin|first=Amy|title=A taste for Italian in New Delhi|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7ab87234-9214-11e2-851f-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingredients and dishes vary widely by [[Regions of Italy|region]].

'''Kogaionon''' was the holy mountain of the [[Geto-Dacians]], the place where [[Zalmoxis]] stayed in a cave for three years. After his disappearance into Kogaionon, he was considered dead by the Getae but after three years he resurrected and showed himself to the people, who became convinced by his holy preaching when he emerged from Kogaionon.

[[Strabo]] claims that a river with the same name flowed in the vicinity.

One modern translation of Kogaionon is "sacred mountain", which would be connected to a probable Dacian word ''kaga'' meaning "sacred", attested in two early 2nd century inscriptions from [[Constanța|Tomis]].&lt;ref name="olteanu"&gt;Olteanu&lt;/ref&gt;

Kogaionon's location is still under debate, but thought to be either in the area around the Dacian capital [[Sarmizegetusa Regia]] (there is a 2291m summit there called Gugu and there are speculations that it could be the holy mountain;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adevarul.ro/locale/hunedoara/muntele-sfant-dacilor-locul-secret-stramosii-venerau-zamolxis-oferindu-i-jertfe-umane-1_55673762cfbe376e35b0df95/index.html|title=Muntele sfânt al dacilor, locul secret unde strămoşii noştri îl venerau pe Zamolxis, oferindu-i jertfe umane|author=|date=|website=adevarul.ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may also have been Dealul Grădiştei where the ruins of the sanctuaries of Sarmizegetusa are located){{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} or even the [[Ceahlău Massif|Ceahlău]] mountain, because every year on 6/7 August the shadow of the mountain forms a pyramid which is thought to have been made by the Dacians.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The '''''Latvian Soviet Encyclopedia''''' ({{lang-lv|Latvijas padomju enciklopēdija}}) is a universal [[encyclopedia]] in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] in 10 volumes.

== History ==
The main part of the encyclopaedia was published in ten volumes from 1981 to 1988. The volume 5&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Latvian SSR'', was also published in [[Russian language|Russian]]. A supplement was published in 1988.

The main editor was Pēteris Jērāns, and it was printed in [[Riga]]&lt;ref name="Lat"&gt;Latvijas padomju enciklopēdija. Rīga. Galvenā Enciklopēdiju redakcija. 1. sējums.&lt;/ref&gt; numbering 75,000 sets.&lt;ref&gt;«Ежегодник книги СССР». Издательство Всесоюзной книжной палаты, 1983 год, Том 1, Часть 1, Стр. 585.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The encyclopedia contains around 60,000 articles, and includes around 20,000 illustrations and over 600 maps.&lt;ref name="Lat" /&gt; It covers all branches of knowledge, with the expected ideological emphasis of publications originating in the [[Soviet bloc]] in the period.

{{ethnolinguistic groups in Africa}}
The '''ethnic groups of Africa''' number in the thousands, with each population generally having its own [[Languages of Africa|language]] (or [[dialect]] of a language) and [[culture]]. The ethnolinguistic groups include various [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]], [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]], [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] populations.

The official population count of the various ethnic groups in Africa is highly uncertain, both due to limited infrastructure to perform censuses and due to the rapid population growth. There have also been accusations of deliberate misreporting in order to give selected ethnicities numerical superiority (as in the case of Nigeria's Hausa, Fulani, Yoruba and Igbo people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L29819278.htm |publisher=Reuters |title=Nigeria gives census result, avoids risky details |first=Felix |last=Onuah |date=29 December 2006|accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Growing Apart: Oil, Politics, and Economic Change in Indonesia and Nigeria |first=Peter |last=Lewis |page=132 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-472-06980-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4-rlVeb1n0C&amp;pg=PA132 |accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Federalism and Ethnic Conflict in Nigeria |first=Rotimi T. |last=Suberu |publisher=US Institute of Peace Press |year=2001 |page=154 |isbn=1-929223-28-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKeUMmDlPkEC&amp;pg=PA154 |accessdate=2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 [[human genetic clustering|genetic clustering]] study, which genotyped 1327 polymorphic markers in various African populations, identified six ancestral clusters. The clustering corresponded closely with ethnicity, culture and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tishkoff|first1=SA|year=2009|title=The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=324|issue=5930|pages=1037–39|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/wjs18/Pop_Structure/TishkoffAfrican.pdf |bibcode=2009Sci...324.1035T|doi=10.1126/science.1172257|pmc=2947357 |pmid=19407144|display-authors=etal|quote=We incorporated geographic data into a Bayesian clustering analysis, assuming no admixture (TESS software) (25) and distinguished six clusters within continental Africa (Fig. 5A). The most geographically widespread cluster (orange) extends from far Western Africa (the Mandinka) through central Africa to the Bantu speakers of South Africa (the Venda and Xhosa) and corresponds to the distribution of the Niger-Kordofanian language family, possibly reflecting the spread of Bantu-speaking populations from near the Nigerian/Cameroon highlands across eastern and southern Africa within the past 5000 to 3000 years (26,27). Another inferred cluster includes the Pygmy and SAK populations (green), with a noncontiguous geographic distribution in central and southeastern Africa, consistent with the STRUCTURE (Fig. 3) and phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 1). Another geographically contiguous cluster extends across northern Africa (blue) into Mali (the Dogon), Ethiopia, and northern Kenya. With the exception of the Dogon, these populations speak an Afroasiatic language. Chadic-speaking and Nilo-Saharan–speaking populations from Nigeria, Cameroon, and central Chad, as well as several Nilo-Saharan–speaking populations from southern Sudan, constitute another cluster (red). Nilo-Saharan and Cushitic speakers from the Sudan, Kenya, and Tanzania, as well as some of the Bantu speakers from Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda (Hutu/Tutsi), constitute another cluster (purple), reflecting linguistic evidence for gene flow among these populations over the past ~5000 years (28,29). Finally, the Hadza are the sole constituents of a sixth cluster (yellow), consistent with their distinctive genetic structure identified by PCA and STRUCTURE.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 [[whole genome sequencing]] study of the world's populations observed similar clusters among the populations in Africa. At K=9, distinct ancestral components defined the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afrosiatic]]-speaking populations inhabiting [[North Africa]] and [[Northeast Africa]]; the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking populations in Northeast Africa and [[East Africa]]; the [[Aari language|Ari]] populations in Northeast Africa; the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]]-speaking populations in West-Central Africa, [[West Africa]], East Africa and [[Southern Africa]]; the [[African Pygmies|Pygmy]] populations in [[Central Africa]]; and the [[Khoisan]] populations in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schlebusch|first1=Carina M.|last2=Jakobsson|first2=Mattias|title=Tales of Human Migration, Admixture, and Selection in Africa|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|date=2018|volume=0|pages=10.9–10.10; Figure 3.3 Population structure analysis and inferred ancestry components for selected choices of assumed number of ancestries|url=http://docdro.id/C0L2mMo|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maria Vasilyevna Klenova''' ({{lang-ru|Мари́я Васи́льевна Клёнова}}) (12 August 1898 – 6 August 1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peoples.ru/science/geologist/maria_klenova/|title=Биография Мария Клёнова|last=|first=|date=|website=www.peoples.ru|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Russia]]n and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[marine geology|marine geologist]] and one of the founders of Russian marine science and contributor to the first Soviet Antarctic atlas.&lt;ref name="GEBCO"&gt;{{cite web| title=Sixteenth Meeting of the GEBCO Subcommittee on Undersea Feature Names| publisher=[[International Hydrographic Organization]]|date=April 2002| url=http://www.gebco.net/about_us/meetings_and_minutes/documents/gebco_scufn_16_report.pdf| accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klenova studied to become a professor and later on worked as a member of the Council for Antarctic Research of the USSR Academy of Sciences.  During that time she spent nearly thirty years researching in the Polar Regions and become the first woman scientist to do research in [[Antarctica]]. She joined in the [[1st Soviet Antarctic Expedition|First Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] (1955–57) and worked with [[ANARE]] (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) at [[Macquarie Island]].

== Early life ==
Maria Vasilyevna Klenova was born in [[Irkutsk|Irkutsk, Russia]] in 1898. She was educated in [[Yekaterinburg|Ekaterinburg]] and moved to [[Moscow]] during [[World War I]] to work in a hospital while undertaking medical studies. She travelled to [[Siberia]] to continue her medical studies during the [[Russian Civil War]]. In the early 1920s Klenova returned to Moscow and pursued a study of mineralogy. She graduated from [[Moscow State University]] in 1924. She undertook her doctoral degree under supervisors Yakov Samoilov and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kalemeneva, E. and Lajus, J. "Soviet Female Experts in the Polar Regions" in The Palgrave Handbook of Women and Gender in Twentieth-Century Russia and the Soviet Union|last=Ilic|first=Melanie (ed)|publisher=Palgrave|year=2017|isbn=9781137549051|location=|pages=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Klenova began her marine geology career in 1925 as a researcher aboard the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] research vessel ''[[Perseus (Soviet ship)|Perseus]]'', attached to the Floating Marine Research Institute (precursor to the present-day [[Nikolai M. Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography]]) in the [[Barents Sea]] and the archipelagos of [[Novaya Zemlya]], [[Spitsbergen]], and [[Franz Josef Land]]. In 1933 Klenova produced the first complete seabed map of the Barents Sea.  She identified and named the Barents abyssal plain (85ºN, 40ºE) after the Dutch polar explorer [[Willem Barentsz]] (or Barents) who died in 1597 on his third expedition to find the Northeast Passage.

In 1949 Klenova became a senior research associate at the [[Shirshov Institute of Oceanology]] of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]]. Her work included analyses of seabed geology in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Antarctic]], and in the [[Caspian sea|Caspian]], [[Barents Sea|Barents]] and [[White Sea]]s. In the austral summer of 1956 she traveled with a Soviet [[oceanographic]] team to map uncharted areas of the Antarctic coast.

The Klenova Valley ({{coord|84|36|N|55|00|W|}}), an oceanographic valley discovered in 1981–1983 by the USSR [[Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet|Northern Fleet]] Hydrographic Expedition is named after her.&lt;ref name="GEBCO" /&gt; Klenova Seamount, about 450&amp;nbsp;km east of Salvador, Brazil (13º01.5' S, 34º15' W), [[List of craters on Venus|Klenova crater on Venus]] and [[Klenova Peak]] in [[Antarctica]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=137791 Klenova Peak.] [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|SCAR]] [[Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]]&lt;/ref&gt; are also named in her honour.

==Contributions==
Her contributions helped to create the first Antarctic atlas, a groundbreaking four-volume work published in the Soviet Union. Klenova spent most of her time making observations on board the Russian [[icebreaker]]s ''Ob'' and ''Lena''.  Her group took oceanographic measurements in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters.  Along with Klenova there were seven other women on board the ''Ob''.  At that time women were rarely allowed to venture on land and had to rely on their male colleagues to collect and bring back data samples.  In between these two voyages she worked at Mirny, a Russian base on the [[Queen Mary Coast]] (which is shared by [[Australian]] and [[Poland|Polish]] Research Stations). On the way home Klenova went to Macquarie Island where she became the first female scientist ever to go ashore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanwide-expeditions.com/blog/the-first-woman-and-female-scientists-in-antarctica|title=The first woman and female scientists in Antarctica|website=oceanwide-expeditions.com|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her book ''Geologiya Moray'' (Geology of the sea) published in 1948 was the second textbook dedicated to marine geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8Ul9OznRW8C|title=Marine Science: Decade by Decade|last=Reed|first=Christina|last2=Cannon|first2=William J.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|isbn=9780816055340|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1697">'''Naglite''' ('''''{{smallcaps|nag}}'''-lee-te'') ({{lang-bg|Наглите}}), literally '''The Insolent Ones''', was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] criminal group involved in more than ten high-profile kidnappings in 2008-09. They asked for ransoms of several hundred thousand [[euro]]s in each case, and in the event of delay or insufficient payment, cut fingers off their victims. In a December 2009 police action code-named "Naglite", more than 25 people were arrested in several Bulgarian cities.

Naglite kept their victims blindfolded and none managed to see any of the kidnappers' faces. Nine people were brought to trial in 2010, four of whom were found guilty in April 2012, and again in 2014 by the [[Supreme Court of Cassation of Bulgaria|Supreme Court of Cassation]]. They were convicted for a total of eight kidnappings and one attempted kidnapping. Three of them got an 18-year sentence and one a ten-year sentence.&lt;ref name="medi_ВКСн"&gt;{{Cite web | title = ВКС намали присъдата на един от "Наглите" заради показанията му | last = Mitov | first = Boris | work = Mediapool.bg | date = 1 July 2014 | accessdate = 2015-08-16 | url = http://www.mediapool.bg/vks-namali-prisadata-na-edin-ot-naglite-zaradi-pokazaniyata-mu-news222135.html | language = bg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Novi Sad Theatre''' ({{lang-sr|Новосадско позориште|translit=Novosadsko pozorište}}; {{lang-hu|Újvidéki Színház}}) is a small [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Hungarian language]] theatre in [[Serbia]]. It is located in the [[Rotkvarija]] neighborhood, near [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|city centre]] on Jovana Subotića street 3-5, in [[Novi Sad]], the capital of the [[Serbia]]n province [[Vojvodina]]. 

The theatre was established in 1974, and its first play was [[István Örkény|Örkény István]]'s ''Macskajáték'', which was held on 27 January 1974. Before that time, there was only one Hungarian language theatre in Vojvodina and it was located in [[Subotica]].

It was published in the United Kingdom under the more prosaic title '''''Our Final Century: Will the Human Race Survive the Twenty-first Century?'''''. 
The premise of the book is that the [[Earth]] and [[human]] survival are in far greater danger from the potential effects of modern [[technology]] than is commonly realised, and that the 21st century may be a critical moment in history when humanity's fate is decided. Rees discusses a range of [[existential risk]]s confronting humanity, and controversially estimates that the [[probability]] of [[human extinction|extinction]] before 2100 CE is around 50 percent, based on the possibility of malign or accidental release of destructive technology.

==Humanity's fate and recommendations for survival==
In ''Our Final Hour'', Rees predicts that one of the two following outcomes is inevitable for humanity:

* [[Human extinction]], as a result of the runaway effects of new technology (e.g. [[nanotechnology]]), [[Superconducting Super Collider]] type large scale particle accelerators, or uncontrolled scientific research; [[terrorism|terrorist]] or [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] violence; or destruction of the [[biosphere]]; or
* [[Space and survival|Human expansion throughout space]], by minimising, avoiding or overcoming these problems.

In order to avoid human extinction, Rees advocates control of scientific research worldwide, and control of open access to such research. He states that, in the 1990s, [[Aum Shinrikyo]] tried unsuccessfully to obtain an [[Ebola]] virus sample, which they could now create in their [[Mount Fuji]] lab, using ingredients and instructions from the [[Internet]].

Rees has long been active in [[disarmament]] campaigns, and although he now sees [[nuclear warfare]] as a less probable cause of extinction, he advocates [[arms control]] as much as control of science and technology (see also [[World government]]). More concerning to him now is the possibility of major [[Bioterrorism|bioterrorist]] attacks, as evidenced by his outstanding bet (registered with the [[Long Bet Project]]) that such events will occur within the next twenty years.

In terms of space exploration and survival through [[Space colonization|colonization]], Rees is an advocate of the [[free market]] solution, and believes that the [[wealthy]] will push back the frontiers of space.

==Reviews==
* [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/scienceandnature/0,6121,976926,00.html Review by Oliver Morton in ''The Guardian''] &amp;mdash; Morton believes that Rees's 50% chance of extinction is too high and states that "defences against bioterror will evolve in step with the threat. It is entirely conceivable that there will be no last move, and no final 'game over'".

* [http://www.nationalreview.com/content/end-hand-1 Review by John Derbyshire in ''The National Review''] &amp;mdash; Derbyshire is convinced by Rees's argument and considers that human extinction does not seem improbable.
* [http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/our_final_hour_book_review.html Review by The Universe Today] which finds the book "makes some well-reasoned arguments about the dangers of scientific exploration" but is "short on solutions that could help guide policy".

==Further reading==
*Rees does not object to the [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]] for human extinction offered by the [[Doomsday argument]] (as championed by [[John Leslie (philosopher)|John Leslie]] in the 1996 book ''The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction'' (Routledge, hardcover: {{ISBN|0-415-14043-9}}, paperback: {{ISBN|0-415-18447-9}})), but he does not consider it to describe the practical threats and solutions that he discusses.
*In ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'', [[Raymond Kurzweil]] reaches the same conclusion as Rees on the probability of human extinction within the 21st century.
*In the 2004 book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'' (Viking Adult, {{ISBN|0-670-03337-5}}), [[Jared Diamond]] suggests that Sir Martin's hopes of worldwide cooperation in avoiding extinction scenarios may be in vain.
*[[Ronald Wright]], who quotes Martin Rees with approval in ''[[A Short History of Progress]]'' (at p.&amp;nbsp;125&amp;ndash;6), is just as pessimistic &amp;ndash; much more so than [[Jared Diamond]] &amp;ndash; and argues that human history reveals a disastrous series of technological [[progress trap]]s.

The '''Pakistan Workers' Federation''' (PWF) is an umbrella organization of national [[trade union]]s in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=labourwatch&gt;[http://labourwatchpakistan.com/overview-of-trade-unions-in-pakistan/ Pakistan Workers' Federation on Labour Watch Pakistan website] Published 20 April 2011, Retrieved 2 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

These trade unions individually were determined to work together to promote and protect their rights by creating “Pakistan Workers Federation” initially through merger of three national trade union centers of Pakistan in 1994, namely: [[All Pakistan Federation of Trade Unions]] (APFTU), [[All Pakistan Federation of Labour]] (APFOL) and [[Pakistan National Federation of Trade Unions]] (PNFTU). Later the actual merger did take place in 2004. Although all three merging unions remain affiliated individually with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC) based in [[Paris]], [[France]]. As of 2011, the merged Pakistan Workers' Federation represents approximately 60% of the organized workforce of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=labourwatch/&gt;

The '''Pontifical Council for Dialogue with Non-Believers''' ({{lang-la|Pontificium consilium pro dialogo cum non credentibus, PCDNC}}) was a [[dicastery]] of the [[Roman Curia]] charged with promoting dialogue between the Catholic Church and non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Secretariat for Non-Believers|date=28 August 1968|title=

Its original designation as "Secretariat" was changed to "Pontifical Council" on 30 June 1988.

The {{abbr|PCDNC|Pontifical Council for Dialogue with Non-Believers}} was merged into the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="GCatholic"&gt;{{cite web|editor-last=Chow|editor-first=Gabriel|date=|title=Pontifical Council for Dialogue with Non-Believers|website=gcatholic.org|location=Toronto|publisher=Gabriel Chow|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/romancuria/d76.htm|access-date=6 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023122052/http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/romancuria/d76.htm|archivedate=23 October 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnPaulII1993"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Paul II, Pope|date=25 March 1993|title=Inde a Pontificatus|website=vatican.va|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_25031993_inde-a-pontificatus.html|access-date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160008/http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_25031993_inde-a-pontificatus.html|archivedate=6 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Queen's Artillery Regiment''' ({{lang-da|Dronningens Artilleriregiment, DAR}}) was a [[Royal Danish Army]] artillery regiment.

==History==
The Queen's Artillery Regiment was created on 1 November 2000 by merging [[Sønderjyske Artilleriregiment]] in [[Varde]] and [[Nørrejyske Artilleriregiment]] located in [[Skive (Denmark)|Skive]]. It was located on [[Varde Barracks]]. On 1 November 2005 [[Kongens Artilleriregiment]] was merged with the regiment, creating the artillery regiment, the [[Danish Artillery Regiment]], the last artillery regiment of Denmark's armed forces.
