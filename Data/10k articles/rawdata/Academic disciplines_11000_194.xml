'''1RXS J160929.1-210524''' (also known as GSC 6213-1358 or [[PZ99]] J160930.3-210459) is a [[pre-main-sequence star]] nearly 470 [[light-year]]s away in the [[constellation]] of [[Scorpius]].

The [[star]] was identified as a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the [[Scorpius-Centaurus Association]] by Thomas Preibisch and coauthors in 1998,&lt;ref name="Preibisch1999"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Preibisch, Thomas|author2=Zinnecker, Hans|date=May 1999|title=The History of Low-Mass Star Formation in the Upper Scorpius OB Association|journal=Astronomical Journal|volume=117|issue=5|pages=2381|bibcode = 1999AJ....117.2381P |doi = 10.1086/300842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and originally assigned an age of {{Nowrap|5 million}} years old based on its group membership.
A more recent analysis of the ages of the stars in the Upper Scorpius group pegs its average age at 11 million years.&lt;ref name="Pecaut2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mark J. Pecaut|author2=Eric E. Mamajek|author3=Eric J.

== Stellar characteristics ==

This star was identified as a young object belonging to the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the [[Scorpius–Centaurus Association]] in two papers published in 1998 and 1999, based on its [[lithium]] abundance, [[X ray]] emission, and position in the [[HR diagram]].&lt;ref name="Preibisch1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Preibisch|first=Thomas|date=May 1998|title=A lithium-survey for pre-main sequence stars in the Upper Scorpius OB association|url=|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=333|issue=|pages=619–628|bibcode=1998A&amp;A...333..619P|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Preibisch1999/&gt; The spectrum of 1RXS J160929.1-210524 reveals it to be cooler than the Sun with a [[stellar classification|spectral type]] that has been estimated at K7&lt;ref name=Lafrenière2008/&gt; or M0,&lt;ref name="Bowler2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bowler|first=Brendan P.|last2=Liu|first2=Michael C.|last3=Kraus|first3=Adam L.|last4=Mann|first4=Andrew W.|date=March 2014|title=Spectroscopic Confirmation of Young Planetary-mass Companions on Wide Orbits|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/43945/7/0004-637X_784_1_65.pdf|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=784|issue=1|pages=article 65, 21 pp|bibcode=2014ApJ...784...65B|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/784/1/65|via=|arxiv=1401.7668}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the star can be considered an [[orange dwarf]] or a [[red dwarf]]. The star is estimated to be around 0.85 times as massive as the Sun and to have an [[effective temperature]] of 4,060&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]].&lt;ref name=Lafrenière2008/&gt; The Upper Scorpius association is quite young and only stars earlier (hotter) than type [[A-type main sequence star|A3]] have reached the [[main sequence]]; less massive stars, such as 1RXS J160929.1−210524, are still in the process of contraction during the [[Pre-main-sequence star|pre-main sequence]] phase. Originally, the association was estimated to be around 5 million years old, but a recent 2012 paper made a significant revision of this value to 11 million years, which is therefore considered to be the age of 1RXS J160929.1-210524.&lt;ref name=Pecaut2012/&gt;

== Planetary system ==
On 8 September 2008, it was announced that astronomer David Lafrenière and collaborators used the [[Gemini Observatory]] to take pictures of the star which appeared to show a [[planet]] (designated ''1RXS J160929.1-210524 b''). The apparent planet is very large—about eight times the mass of [[Jupiter]],&lt;ref name="natlgeo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/06/100630-science-space-planets-first-picture-confirmed/ | title="First" Picture of Planet Orbiting Sunlike Star Confirmed | first=Andrew | last=Fazekas | publisher=[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]] | date=30 June 2010 | accessdate=1 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100703024837/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/06/100630-science-space-planets-first-picture-confirmed/| archivedate= 3 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; orbiting the star at a distance of {{nowrap|330 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]]}} (roughly {{nowrap|50 billion kilometres}} or {{Nowrap|31 billion}} miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7617031.stm  | title=Exoplanet 'circles normal star' |publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=15 September 2008 | accessdate=17 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080916120154/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7617031.stm| archivedate=16 September 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orbital status of the companion planet was confirmed in a paper submitted on {{Nowrap|15 June}} 2010 to ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lafrenière | first1 = David | last2 = Jayawardhana | first2 = Ray | last3 = van Kerkwijk | first3 = Marten H. | title = The Directly Imaged Planet around the Young Solar Analog 1RXS J160929.1-210524: Confirmation of Common Proper Motion, Temperature and Mass | date = 2010 | volume = 719 | issue =1 |pages=497 |journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]] | arxiv = 1006.3070 |bibcode = 2010ApJ...719..497L |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/719/1/497 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kruesi |first=Liz |title=Astronomers verify directly imaged planet |url=http://cs.astronomy.com/asycs/blogs/astronomy/2010/06/22/astronomers-verify-directly-imaged-planet.aspx |work=[[Astronomy Magazine]] |date=22 June 2010 |accessdate=1 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630110925/http://cs.astronomy.com/asycs/blogs/astronomy/2010/06/22/astronomers-verify-directly-imaged-planet.aspx |archivedate=30 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it the smallest known [[exoplanet]] orbiting its host at such a distance. It is also the second announced [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Direct imaging|directly imaged]] exoplanet orbiting a sun-like star (after [[GQ Lupi b|GQ Lup b]]), and the 2nd directly imaged exoplanet to have spectrum taken (after [[2M1207b]]).&lt;ref name="natlgeo"/&gt;

The discoverers note that the object's location far from its star presents serious challenges to current models of planetary formation: the timescale to form a planet by core accretion at this distance from the star would be longer than the age of the system itself. One possibility is that the planet may have formed closer to the star and migrated outwards as a result of interactions with the disk or with other planets in the system. An alternative is that the planet formed ''in situ'' via the disk instability mechanism, where the disk fragments because of gravitational instability, though this would require an unusually massive protoplanetary disk.&lt;ref name=Lafrenière2008/&gt;

With the upward revision in the age of the Upper Scorpius group from 5 million to 11 million years, the estimated mass
of 1RXS J1609b is approximately 14 Jupiter masses, i.e. above the deuterium-burning limit.&lt;ref name=Pecaut2012/&gt; An older age for the J1609 system implies that the luminosity of J1609b is consistent with a much more massive object, making more likely that J1609b may be simply a brown dwarf which formed in a manner similar to that of other low-mass and substellar companions.&lt;ref name=Wu2015/&gt;

A 2013 study, using data from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], detected a moderate [[infrared excess|excess]] of [[infrared]] radiation at 24&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|μm]] coming from this system, indicating the presence of a dusty [[debris disk]], but could not determine whether the excess was coming from the star or the substellar companion (or both).&lt;ref name=Bailey2013&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bailey, Vanessa|title=A Thermal Infrared Imaging Study of Very Low Mass, Wide-separation Brown Dwarf Companions to Upper Scorpius Stars: Constraining Circumstellar Environments|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=767|issue=1|pages=article 31, 13 pp|date=April 2013|bibcode=2013ApJ...767...31B|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/767/1/31|arxiv=1302.0582}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, observations with the [[Magellan Telescopes|Magellan Clay Telescope]] found evidence that the light from the substellar object is obscured and reddened by 4.5 visual magnitudes of circunstellar [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], which indicated that the object is surrounded by dusty disk responsible for the infrared excess. When considering the extinction in modeling the object's spectrum, its effective temperature was increased to 2,000&amp;nbsp;K and the spectral type to L2.&lt;ref name=Wu2015&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wu, Ya-Lin|title=New Extinction and Mass Estimates of the Low-mass Companion 1RXS 1609 B with the Magellan AO System: Evidence of an Inclined Dust Disk|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=807|issue=1|pages=artigo L13, 5 pp|date=July 2015|bibcode=2015ApJ...807L..13W|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/807/1/L13|arxiv=1506.05816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method consists of the synthesis of an ancestral [[gene]] and expression of the corresponding ancestral [[protein]].&lt;ref name=thornton/&gt; The idea of protein 'resurrection' was suggested in 1963 by Pauling and Zuckerkandl.&lt;ref&gt;Pauling, L. &amp; Zuckerkandl, E.

Unlike conventional evolutionary and biochemical approaches to studying proteins, i.e. the so-called ''horizontal'' comparison of related protein [[Sequence homology|homologues]] from different branch ends of the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]; ASR probes the statistically inferred ancestral proteins within the nodes of the tree – in a ''vertical'' manner (see diagram, right). This approach gives access to protein properties that may have transiently arisen over evolutionary time and has recently been used as a way to infer the potential [[Evolutionary pressure|selection pressures]] that resulted in the present day sequences seen today. ASR has been used to probe the causative mutation that resulted in a protein's [[neofunctionalization]] after duplication by first determining that said mutation was located between ancestors '5' and '4' on the diagram (illustratively) using functional assays.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Douglas P.|last2=Whitney|first2=Dustin S.|last3=Hanson-Smith|first3=Victor|last4=Woznica|first4=Arielle|last5=Campodonico-Burnett|first5=William|last6=Volkman|first6=Brian F.|last7=King|first7=Nicole|last8=Thornton|first8=Joseph W.|last9=Prehoda|first9=Kenneth E.|date=2016-01-07|title=Evolution of an ancient protein function involved in organized multicellularity in animals|journal=eLife|volume=5|pages=e10147|doi=10.7554/eLife.10147|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4718807|pmid=26740169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of protein [[biophysics]], ASR has also been used to study the development of a protein's thermodynamic and kinetic landscapes over evolutionary time as well as protein folding pathways by combining many modern day analytical techniques such as [[Protein mass spectrometry|HX/MS]].&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; These sort of insights are typically inferred from several ancestors reconstructed along a phylogeny – referring to the previous analogy, by studying nodes ''higher and higher'' (further and further back in evolutionary time) within the tree of life.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harms|first=Michael J.|last2=Thornton|first2=Joseph W.|date=2013-08-01|title=Evolutionary biochemistry: revealing the historical and physical causes of protein properties|url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v14/n8/full/nrg3540.html|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=en|volume=14|issue=8|pages=559–571|doi=10.1038/nrg3540|issn=1471-0056|pmc=4418793|pmid=23864121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ASR studies are conducted ''in vitro'', and have revealed ancestral protein properties that seem to be evolutionarily desirable traits – such as increased thermostability, catalytic activity and catalytic promiscuity. These data have been accredited to artifacts of the ASR algorithms, as well as indicative illustrations of ancient Earth's environment – often, ASR research must be complemented with extensive controls (usually alternate ASR experiments) to mitigate algorithmic error. It should also be noted that not all studied ASR proteins exhibit this so-called 'ancestral superiority'.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Shion A.|last2=Hart|first2=Kathryn M.|last3=Harms|first3=Michael J.|last4=Marqusee|first4=Susan|date=2016-11-15|title=Evolutionary trend toward kinetic stability in the folding trajectory of RNases H|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=113|issue=46|pages=13045–13050|doi=10.1073/pnas.1611781113|issn=1091-6490|pmc=5135364|pmid=27799545}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nascent field of '[[Biochemistry|evolutionary biochemistry]]' has been bolstered by the recent increase in ASR studies using the ancestors as ways to probe organismal fitness within certain cellular contexts – effectively testing ancestral proteins ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Due to inherent limitations in these sorts of studies – primarily being the lack of suitably ancient genomes to fit these ancestors in to, the small repertoire of well categorised laboratory model systems, and the inability to mimic ancient cellular environments; very few ASR studies ''in vivo'' have been conducted. Despite the above mentioned obstacles, preliminary insights into this avenue of research from a 2015 paper, have revealed that observed 'ancestral superiority' ''in vitro'' were not recapitulated ''in vivo'' of a given protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Joanne K.|last2=Prentice|first2=Erica J.|last3=Groussin|first3=Mathieu|last4=Arcus|first4=Vickery L.|date=2015-10-01|title=Reconstructed Ancestral Enzymes Impose a Fitness Cost upon Modern Bacteria Despite Exhibiting Favourable Biochemical Properties|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Reconstructed+Ancestral+Enzymes+Impose+a+Fitness+Cost+upon+Modern+Bacteria+Despite+Exhibiting+Favourable+Biochemical+Properties|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution|volume=81|issue=3-4|pages=110–120|doi=10.1007/s00239-015-9697-5|issn=1432-1432|pmid=26349578}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASR presents one of a few mechanisms to study biochemistry of the [[Precambrian]] era of life (&gt;541[[Millions of years ago|Ma]]) and is hence often used in '[[paleogenetics]]'; indeed Zuckerandl and Pauling originally intended ASR to be the starting point of a field they termed 'Paleobiochemistry'.

==Methodology==

Several related homologues of the protein of interest are selected and aligned in a [[multiple sequence alignment]] (MSA), a '[[phylogenetic tree]]' is constructed with statistically inferred sequences at the nodes of the branches. It is these sequences that are the so-called 'ancestors' – the process of synthesising the corresponding DNA, transforming it into a cell and producing a protein is the so-called 'reconstruction'. Ancestral sequences are typically calculated by [[maximum likelihood]], however [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] methods are also implemented. Because the ancestors are inferred from a phylogeny, the topology and composition of the phylogeny plays a major role in the output ASR sequences. Given that there is much discourse and debate over how to construct phylogenies – for example whether or not thermophilic bacteria are basal or derivative in bacterial evolution – many ASR papers construct several phylogenies with differing topologies and hence differing ASR sequences. These sequences are then compared and often several (~10) are expressed and studied per phylogenetic node. It should be noted that ASR does not claim to recreate the actual sequence of the ancient protein/DNA, but rather a sequence that is likely to be similar to the one that was indeed at the node. This is not considered a shortcoming of ASR as it fits into the '[[Neutral network (evolution)|neutral network]]' model of protein evolution, whereby at evolutionary junctions (nodes) a population of genotypically different but phenotypically similar protein sequences existed in the extant organismal population. Hence, it is possible that ASR would generate one of the sequences of a node's neutral network and while it may not represent the genotype of the last common ancestor of the modern day sequences, it does likely represent the phenotype.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; This is supported by the modern day observation that many mutations in a protein's non-catalytic/functional site cause minor changes in biophysical properties. Hence, ASR allows one to probe the biophysical properties of past proteins and is indicative of ancient genetics.

Maximum likelihood (ML) methods work by generating a sequence where the residue at each position is predicted to be the most likely to occupy said position by the method of inference used – typically this is a [[Position weight matrix|scoring matrix]] (similar to those used in [[BLAST]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s or MSAs) calculated from extant sequences. Alternate methods include [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|maximum parsimony]] (MP) that construct a sequence based on a model of sequence evolution – usually the idea that the minimum number of nucleotidal sequence changes represents the most efficient route for evolution to take and by [[Occam's razor]] is the most likely. MP is often considered the least reliable method for reconstruction as it arguably oversimplifies evolution to a degree that is not applicable on the billion year scale. Another method involves the consideration of residue uncertainty – so-called Bayesian methods – this form of ASR is sometimes used to compliment ML methods but typically produces more ambiguous sequences. In ASR, the term 'ambiguity' refers to residue positions where no clear substitution can be predicted – often in these cases, several ASR sequences are produced, encompassing most of the ambiguities and compared to one-another. ML ASR often needs complimenting experiments to indicate that the derived sequences are more than just consensuses of the input sequences. This is particularly necessary in the observation of 'Ancestral Superiority'.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Lucas C.|last2=Lim|first2=Shion A.|last3=Marqusee|first3=Susan|last4=Harms|first4=Michael J.|date=2016-06-01|title=The thermostability and specificity of ancient proteins|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|volume=38|pages=37–43|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2016.05.015|issn=1879-033X|pmc=5010474|pmid=27288744}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the trend of increasing thermostability, one explanation is that ML ASR creates a consensus sequence of several different, parallel mechanisms evolved to confer minor protein thermostability throughout the phylogeny – leading to an additive effect resulting in 'superior' ancestral thermostability.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Risso|first=Valeria A.|last2=Gavira|first2=Jose A.|last3=Sanchez-Ruiz|first3=Jose M.|date=2014-06-01|title=Thermostable and promiscuous Precambrian proteins|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.12319/abstract|journal=Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1485–1489|doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12319|issn=1462-2920}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of consensus sequences and parallel ASR via non-ML methods are often required to disband this theory per experiment. One other concern raised by ML methods is that the scoring matrices are derived from modern sequences and particular amino acid frequencies seen today may not be the same as in Precambrian biology, resulting in skewed sequence inference. Several studies have attempted to construct ancient scoring matrices via various methodologies and have compared the resultant sequences and their protein's biophysical properties. While these modified sequences result in somewhat different ASR sequences, the observed biophysical properties did not seem to vary outside from experimental error.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaucher|first=Eric A.|last2=Govindarajan|first2=Sridhar|last3=Ganesh|first3=Omjoy K.|date=2008-02-07|title=Palaeotemperature trend for Precambrian life inferred from resurrected proteins|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7179/abs/nature06510.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=451|issue=7179|pages=704–707|doi=10.1038/nature06510|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the 'holistic' nature of ASR and the intense complexity that arises when one considers all the possible sources of experimental error – the experimental community considers the ultimate measurement of ASR reliability to be the comparison of several alternate ASR reconstructions of the same node and the identification of similar biophysical properties. While this method does not offer a robust statistical, mathematical measure of reliability it does build off of the fundamental idea used in ASR that individual amino acid substitutions do not cause significant biophysical property changes in a protein – a tenant that must be held true in order to be able to overcome the effect of inference ambiguity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ancestral-sequence-reconstruction-9780199299188?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction|date=2007-07-26|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199299188|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates used for ASR are often selected based on the particular property of interest being studied – e.g. thermostability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By selecting sequences from either end of a property's range (e.g., psychrophilic proteins and thermophilic proteins) but ''within'' a protein family, ASR can be used to probe the specific sequence changes that conferred the observed biophysical effect – such as stabilising interactions. Consider in the diagram, if sequence 'A' encoded a protein that was optimally functional at neutral pHs and 'D' in acidic conditions, sequence changes between '5' and '2' may illustrate the precise biophysical explanation for this difference. It should be noted that as ASR experiments can extract ancestors that are likely billions of years old, there are often tens if not hundreds of sequence changes between ancestors themselves and ancestors and extant sequences – because of this, such sequence-function evolutionary studies can take a lot of work and rational direction.&lt;ref name="thornton"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thornton | first1 = J.W. | year = 2004 | title = Resurrecting ancient genes: experimental analysis of extinct molecules | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 366–375 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1324 | pmid=15143319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v5/n5/fig_tab/nrg1324_F1.html#figure-title Figure 1] from reference {{Cite journal|last=Harms|first=Michael J.|last2=Thornton|first2=Joseph W.|date=2013-08-01|title=Evolutionary biochemistry: revealing the historical and physical causes of protein properties|url=|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=en|volume=14|issue=8|pages=559–571|doi=10.1038/nrg3540|issn=|pmc=4418793|pmid=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resurrected proteins==
There are many examples of ancestral proteins that have been computationally reconstructed, expressed in living cell lines, and – in many cases – purified and biochemically studied. The Thornton lab notably resurrected several ancestral [[hormone receptors]] (from about 500Ma)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thornton | first1 = JW | last2 = Need | first2 = E | last3 = Crews | first3 = D | year = 2003 | title = Resurrecting the Ancestral Steroid Receptor: Ancient Origin of Estrogen Signaling | url = | journal = Science | volume = 301 | issue = 5640| pages = 1714–1717 | doi = 10.1126/science.1086185 | pmid=14500980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eick | first1 = GN | last2 = Colucci | first2 = JK | last3 = Harms | first3 = MJ | last4 = Orlund | first4 = EA | last5 = Thornton | first5 = JW | year = 2012 | title = Evolution of minimal specificity and promiscuity in steroid hormone receptors | url = | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 8 | issue = 11| page = e1003072 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harms MJ, Eick GN, Goswami D, Colucci JK, Griffin PR, Ortlund EA, Thornton JW.

It should be noted that the 'age' of a reconstructed sequence is determined using a [[molecular clock]] model, and often several are employed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battistuzzi|first=Fabia U|last2=Feijao|first2=Andreia|last3=Hedges|first3=S Blair|date=2004-11-09|title=A genomic timescale of prokaryote evolution: insights into the origin of methanogenesis, phototrophy, and the colonization of land|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=4|pages=44|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-44|issn=1471-2148|pmc=533871|pmid=15535883}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dating technique is often calibrated using geological time-points (such as ancient ocean constituents or [[Banded iron formation|BIF]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) and while these clocks offer the only method of inferring a very ancient protein's age, they have sweeping error margins and are diffuclt to defend against contrary data. To this end, ASR 'age' should really be only used as an indicative feature and is often surpassed altogether for a measurement of the number of substitutions between the ancestral and the modern sequences (the fundiment on which the clock is calculated).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That being said, the use of a clock allows one to compare observed biophysical data of an ASR protein to the geological or ecological environment at the time. For example, ASR studies on bacterial [[EF-Tu]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (proteins involved in [[Translation (biology)|translation]], that are likely rarely subject to [[Horizontal gene transfer|HGT]] and typically exhibit [[Protein melting temperature|Tms]] ~2C greater than [[Environmental growth temperature|Tenv]]) indicate a hotter Precambrian earth which fits very closely with geological data on ancient earth ocean temperatures based on [[Oxygen-18]] isotopic levels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ASR studies of yeast Adhs reveal that the emergence of [[Subfunctionalization|subfunctionalized]] Adhs for ethanol metabolism (not just waste excretion) arose at a time similar to the dawn of fleshy fruit in the [[Cambrian]] era and that before this emergence, Adh served to excrete ethanol as a byproduct of excess [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of a clock also perhaps indicates that the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] occurred before the earliest molecular fossils indicate (&gt;4.1Ga), but given the debatable reliability of molecular clocks, such observations should be taken with caution.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Elizabeth A.|last2=Boehnke|first2=Patrick|last3=Harrison|first3=T.

==Significance==

These experiments address various important questions in evolutionary biology: does [[evolution]] proceed in small steps or in large leaps; is evolution reversible; how does [[Evolution of biological complexity|complexity]] evolve? It has been shown that slight [[mutations]] in the amino acid sequence of hormone receptors determine an important change in their preferences for hormones. These changes mean huge steps in the evolution of the [[endocrine system]]. Thus very small changes at the molecular level may have enormous consequences. The Thornton lab has also been able to show that evolution is irreversible studying the [[glucocorticoid receptor]]. This receptor was changed by seven mutations in a cortisol receptor, but reversing these mutations didn't give the original receptor back. Indicating that [[epistasis]] plays a major role in protein evolution – an observation that in combination with the observations of several examples of parallel evolution, support the neutral network model mentioned above.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Other earlier [[neutral mutation]]s acted as a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet]] and made the changes to the receptor irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bridgham | first1 = JT | last2 = Ortlund | first2 = EA | last3 = Thornton | first3 = JW | year = 2009 | title = An epistatic ratchet constrains the direction of glucocorticoid receptor evolution | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = | pages = 515–519 | doi = 10.1038/nature08249 | pmid=19779450}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different experiments on receptors show that, during their evolution, proteins are greatly differentiated and this explains how complexity may evolve. A closer look at the different ancestral hormone receptors and the various [[hormone]]s shows that at the level of interaction between single amino acid residues and chemical groups of the hormones arise by very small but specific changes. Knowledge about these changes may for example lead to the synthesis of hormonal equivalents capable of mimicking or inhibiting the action of a hormone, which might open possibilities for new therapies.

Given that ASR has revealed a tendency towards ancient thermostability and enzymatic promiscuity, ASR poses as a valuable tool for [[Protein engineering|protein engineers]] who often desire these traits (producing effects sometimes greater than current, rationally lead tools).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; ASR also promises to 'resurrect' phenotipically similar 'ancient organisms' which in turn would allow evolutionary biochemists to probe the story of life. Proponents of ASR such as Benner state that through these and other experiments, the end of the current century will see a level of understanding in biology analogous to the one that arose in classical chemistry in the last century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12788">'''Biological augmentation''' is the addition of [[archaea]] or [[bacterial culture]]s required to speed up the rate of [[Biodegradation|degradation]] of a [[contaminant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientists Discover Analog for Extraterrestrial Life in Idaho Hot Spring|url = http://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/archaea.html|website = toxics.usgs.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-11|first = David W.|last = Morganwalp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms that originate from contaminated areas may already be able to break down waste, but perhaps inefficiently and slowly.

Bioaugmentation usually requires studying the [[Endemic (ecology)|indigenous]] varieties present in the location to determine if [[biostimulation]] is possible. If the indigenous variety do not have the [[metabolic]] capability to perform the remediation process, [[exogenous]] varieties with such sophisticated pathways are introduced.

Bioaugmentation is commonly used in [[municipal wastewater]] [[wastewater treatment|treatment]] to restart activated sludge [[bioreactor]]s. Most cultures available contain microbial cultures, already containing all necessary microorganisms (''[[Bacillus licheniformis|B. licheniformis]]'', ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis|B. thuringiensis]]'', ''[[Paenibacillus polymyxa|P. polymyxa]]'', ''[[Bacillus stearothermophilus|B. stearothermophilus]]'', [[Penicillium|''Penicillium'' sp.]], [[Aspergillus sp.|''Aspergillus'' sp.]], ''[[Flavobacterium]]'', ''[[Arthrobacter]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Streptomyces]]'', ''[[Saccharomyces]]'', ''Triphoderma'', etc.). Activated sludge systems are generally based on microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa, nematodes, rotifers, and fungi, which are capable of degrading biodegradable organic matter. There are many positive outcomes from the use of bioaugmentation, such as the improvement in efficiency and speed of the process of breaking down substances and the reduction of toxic particles in an area.
&lt;ref&gt;Huban, C.M. [Betz-Dearborn Inc., and R.D. [Sybron Chemicals Plowman, [http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/455431#  "Bioaugmentation: Put Microbes to Work.” Chemical Engineering 104.3"], (1997): n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soil remediation==
{{see|soil remediation}}
Bioaugmentation is favorable in contaminated soils that have undergone bioremediation, but still pose an environmental risk. This is because microorganisms that were originally in the environment did not accomplish their task during [[bioremediation]] when it came to breaking down chemicals in the [[contaminated soil]]. The failure of original bacteria can be caused by environmental stresses, as well as changes in the microbial population due to mutation rates. When microorganisms are added, they are potentially more suited to the nature of the new contaminant, meanwhile the older microorganisms are similar to the older pollution and contamination{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. However, this is merely one of many factors; site size is also a very important determinant. In order to see whether bioaugmentation should be implemented, the overall setting must be considered.  Also, some highly specialized microorganisms are not capable of adapting to certain site settings. Availability of certain microorganism types (as used for bioremediation) may also be a problem.  Although bioaugmentation may appear to be a perfect solution for contaminated soil, it can have drawbacks.  For example, the wrong type of bacteria can result in potentially clogged aquifers, or the remediation result may be incomplete or unsatisfactory.
&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vogel, Timothy M.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095816699680036X#|title=Bioaugmentation as a soil bioremediation approach|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=7|issue=3 |year=1996|pages=311–316|pmid=8785436|doi=10.1016/s0958-1669(96)80036-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioaugmentation of chlorinated solvents==
At sites where soil and groundwater are contaminated with chlorinated ethenes, such as [[tetrachloroethylene]] and [[trichloroethylene]], bioaugmentation can be used to ensure that the ''in situ'' microorganisms can completely degrade these contaminants to [[ethylene]] and [[chloride]], which are non-toxic.  Bioaugmentation is typically only applicable to bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes, although there are emerging cultures with the potential to biodegrade other compounds including [[BTX (chemistry)|BTEX]], [[chloroethane]]s, [[chloromethane]]s, and [[methyl tert-butyl ether|MTBE]].  The first reported application of bioaugmentation for chlorinated ethenes was at [[Kelly Air Force Base]], TX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Major, D.W., M.L. McMaster, E.E. Cox, E.A. Edwards, S.M. Dworatzek, E.R. Hendrickson, M.G. Starr, J.A.  Payne, and L.W. Buonamici|year= 2002|title=Field Demonstration  of  Successful Bioaugmentation to Achieve Dechlorination of Tetrachloroethene to Ethene|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|volume=36|pages=5106–5116|doi=10.1021/es0255711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioaugmentation is typically performed in conjunction with the addition of electron donor (biostimulation) to achieve geochemical conditions in groundwater that favor the growth of the dechlorinating microorganisms in the bioaugmentation culture.

==Niche fitness==
Including more microbes into an environment is beneficial to the speed of the cleanup duration. The interaction and competitions of two compounds influence the performance that a microorganism, original or new, could have. This can be tested by placing a soil that favors the new microbes into the area and then looking at the performance. The results will show if the new microorganism can perform well enough in that soil with other microorganisms. This helps to determine the correct amount of microbes and indigenous substances that are needed in order to optimize performance and create a co-metabolism.

==Coke plant wastewater in China==
An example of how bioaugmentation has improved an environment, is in the [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] plant wastewater in China. [[Coal in China]] is used as a main energy source and the contaminated water contains harmful toxic contaminants like [[ammonia]], [[thiocyanate]], [[phenols]] and other organic compounds, such as mono- and [[Polycyclic compound|polycyclic]] nitrogen-containing [[aromatics]], oxygen and sulfur-containing [[heterocyclic]]s and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Previous measures to treat this problem was an aerobic-anoxic-oxic system, solvent extractions, stream stripping, and [[biological treatment]]. Bioaugmentation has been reported to remove 3-chlorobenzoate, 4-methyl benzoate, [[toluene]], [[phenol]], and [[chlorinated solvents]].

The anaerobic reactor was packed with semi-soft media, which were constructed by plastic ring and synthetic fiber string. The anoxic reactor is a completely mixed reactor while the oxic reactor is a hybrid bioreactor in which [[polyurethane]] foam carriers were added. Water from anoxic reactor, odic reactor and sedimentation tank were used and had mix-ins of different amount of old and developed microbes with .75 concentration and 28 degree Celsius. The rate of contaminant degradation depended on the amount of microbe concentration. In the enhanced microbial community indigenous microorganisms broke down the contaminants in the coke plant wastewater, such as [[pyridines]], and [[Phenols|phenolic]] compounds. When indigenous heterotrophic microorganisms were added, they converted many large molecular compounds into smaller and simpler compounds, which could be taken from more biodegradable organic compounds. This proves that bioaugmentation could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted compounds that are not properly removed by conventional biological treatment system. When bioaugmentation is combined with A1–A2–O system for the treatment of coke plant wastewater it is very powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jianlong Wang ''et al.'' | year = 2002 | title = Bioaugmentation as a tool to enhance the removal of refractory compound in coke plant wastewater | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032959202002273 | journal = Process Biochemistry | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 777–781 | doi=10.1016/S0032-9592(02)00227-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petroleum cleanup==
In the [[petroleum industry]], there is a large problem with how oilfield drilling pit is disposed of. Many used to simply place dirt over the pit, but it is far more productive and economically beneficial to use bioaugmentation. With the use of advanced microbes, drilling companies can actually treat the problem in the oilfield pit instead of transferring the waste around. Specifically, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] can be metabolized by some bacteria, which significantly reduces environmental damage from drilling activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alex|last1=Fanelli|title=Bioaugmentation|url=http://www.soil-bio-remediation.com/products/|publisher=Soil Bioremediation|date=2016|access-date=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given suitable environmental conditions, microbes are placed in the oilpit to break down hydrocarbons and alongside are other nutrients. Before treatment there was a [[total petroleum hydrocarbon]] (TPH) level of 44,880 [[parts per million|ppm]], which within just 47 days the TPH was lowered to a level of 10,000 ppm to 6,486 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, T. P., [http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/483721 "Bioaugmentation for the treatment of oilfield drilling waste."], ''PennWell Conferences and Exhibitions, Houston, TX (United States)'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failures and potential solutions==
There have been many instances where bioaugmentation had deficiencies in its process. Examples include Goldstein et al., 1985;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Appl Environ Microbiol|year=1985|volume=50|issue=4|pages=977–83|title=Reasons for possible failure of inoculation to enhance biodegradation|author=Goldstein RM, Mallory LM, Alexander M.|pmid=4083891|pmc=291779}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson and Stephenson, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Biotechnol. Adv.|year=1992|volume=10|issue=4|pages=549–59|title=Bioaugmentation for enhancing biological wastewater treatment|author=Stephenson D, Stephenson T.|pmid=14543705|doi=10.1016/0734-9750(92)91452-k}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouchez et al., 2000; Vogel and Walter, 2001; Wagner-Döbler, 2003. Many of these problems occurred because the [[microbial ecology]] issues were not taken into consideration in order to map the performance of the bioaugmentation. It is crucial to consider the microbes' ability to withstand the conditions in the microbial community to be placed in. In many of the cases that have failed, only the microbes' ability to break down compounds was considered and less their [[biological fitness|fitness]] in existing communities and the resulting competitive stress. It is better to identify the existing communities before looking at the strains needed to break down pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thompson Ian P. ''et al.'' | year = 2005 | title = Bioaugmentation for bioremediation: the challenge of strain selection | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00804.x/full | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 7 | issue = 7| pages = 909–915 | doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00804.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2556">'''Blend time''', sometimes termed '''mixing time''', is the time to achieve a predefined level of homogeneity of a [[Flow tracer|tracer]] in a [[Static mixer|mixing vessel]]. Blend time is an important parameter to evaluate the mixing efficiency of mixing devices.&lt;ref name="Bai"&gt;Bai, G., Armenante, P. M., Plank, R. V., “Experimental and Computational Determination of Blend Time in USP Dissolution Testing Apparatus II,” Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Volume 96, Issue 11, Pages 3072-3086, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to make this definition valid, the tracer should be in the same physical [[Phase (matter)|phase]] (e.g. liquid) as the bulk material.   
 
Blend time can be determined either with [[experiment]]s or [[Mathematical model|numerical modeling]], such as [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD).&lt;ref&gt;Campolo M, Soldati A. 2004.

(Chapter 4)&lt;/ref&gt; The conductivity method requires a conductivity probe to present in the target system, which make it an intrusive method because the existence of the probe might change the mixing efficiency of the mixing device. Discoloration method does not require any probe which makes it a non-intrusive method. However, the color detection device (sometimes the [[human eye]]) needs to be [[Calibration|calibrated]] against the conductivity method.&lt;ref name="Bai" /&gt;  Both methods are usually applied to monitor the  concentration of the tracer in the most difficult to mix locations such as the area adjacent to the impeller shaft.

The benefit of numerical modeling is that once the modeling is completed, the blend time of any predetermined level of homogeneity of any location within the mixing system can be predicted, which is impossible to accomplish by experimental methods. However, numerical modeling needs to be validated by experimental methods.&lt;ref name="Bai" /&gt;

'''Campus Bible Study''' (or '''CBS''') was established in 1975 at the [[University of New South Wales]] by the then [[Anglican]] chaplain [[Phillip Jensen]]. CBS celebrated its 40th Anniversary in 2015, and continues to officially operate out of UNSW's Anglican Chaplaincy (similarly, there are chaplaincy groups for Muslims, Buddhists, etc.). The current Anglican Chaplain is Carl Matthei. 

=== Overview ===
During a typical week, CBS runs large public Bible-teaching meetings, many small-group Bible studies, and other training sessions in theology and ministry for students. CBS also runs three conferences per year, the largest one being Mid-Year Conference (MYC), which typically attracts 500-750 students. While officially linked to the movement of [[Sydney Anglicans]], Campus Bible Study is [[non-denominational]] and welcomes everyone to their public meetings. CBS focuses on the [[Bible]] rather than particular denominations beliefs, and seeks to challenge individuals to consider the [[gospel]] of [[Jesus]]. 

Throughout its history, CBS has been the source of a number of innovative ministries, including the development of the [[Ministry Training Strategy]] (MTS) and the creation of [[Matthias Media]]. Campus Bible Study has also been influential in encouraging an increasing number of young people from [[Sydney]] into full-time Christian Ministry, and has been linked to the growth in enrolments at [[Moore Theological College]] through MTS.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} 

=== University Churches ===
CBS also runs five different university churches for various groups of students living in the residential colleges at UNSW. [http://www.unichurch.org.au/ Unichurch UNSW] is an English speaking congregation. The [http://www.focus-unsw.org/ Fellowship of Overseas University Students] (FOCUS) at UNSW runs four congregations for international students — Mandarin, Cantonese, Indonesian, and International. 

=== Affiliations ===
CBS should not be confused with the Christian Union (CU), which (as of 2006) was a student-run, Student-Guild-affiliated organisation. CBS and the CU work in concert to conduct ministry on campus. Most members of CU are also members of CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arcunsw.orgsync.com/org/christianunion/About|title=Christian Union UNSW|website=arcunsw.orgsync.com|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS is also affiliated with the [[Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afes.org.au/campus/campus-bible-study-university-new-south-wales-kensington|title=Campus Bible Study &gt; University of New South Wales, Kensington {{!}} Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students (AFES)|website=afes.org.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (AFES) but is not a member — the AFES group at UNSW is the Christian Union (CU).

'''Cannibalism''' is the act of one individual of a species consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food. To consume the same species, or show cannibalistic behavior, is a common [[ecology|ecological]] interaction in the animal kingdom, and has been recorded for more than 1,500 [[species]].&lt;ref name="PolisThe"&gt;G. A. Polis, The evolution and dynamics of intraspecific predation, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 12, 225-251 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human cannibalism]] is well-documented, both in ancient and recent times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Goldman |editor-first=Laurence |year=1999 |title=The Anthropology of Cannibalism |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-89789-596-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of cannibalism increases in nutritionally poor environments as individuals turn to other conspecific individuals as an additional food source.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"&gt;Elgar, M.A. &amp; Crespi, B.J. 1992, Cannibalism: ecology and evolution among diverse taxa, Oxford University Press, Oxford [England]; New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannibalism regulates population numbers, whereby resources such as food, shelter and territory become more readily available with the decrease of potential competition. Although it may benefit the individual, it has been shown that the presence of cannibalism decreases the expected survival rate of the whole population and increases the risk of consuming a relative.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; Other negative effects may include the increased risk of [[pathogen]] transmission as the encounter rate of hosts increases.&lt;ref name= "Rudolf"&gt;Rudolf, V.H.W. &amp; Antonovics, J. 2007, "Disease transmission by cannibalism: rare event or common occurrence?", Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, vol. 274, no. 1614, pp. 1205-1210.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannibalism, however, does not—as once believed—occur only as a result of extreme food shortage or artificial/unnatural conditions, but could also occur under natural conditions in a variety of species.&lt;ref name="PolisThe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laurel R. Fox 1975"&gt;Laurel R. Fox, Cannibalism in natural populations, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 6, 87-106 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Elgar and [[Bernard Crespi|B. J. Crespi]] (eds), Cannibalism: Ecology and evolution among diverse taxa. (Oxford University Press, New York, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannibalism seems to be especially prevalent in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s, in which up to approximately  90% of the [[organism]]s{{vague|Reason= Is this intended to reflect counts of cann'istic individuals, of species w/ any cannibals, or approx limit w/in any species. And why no distinction between predation and scavenging?|date=May 2018}} engage in cannibalistic activity at some point in their life cycle.{{vague|Reason= Is silence about plant &amp; protozoan species merely neglectful, or intentional inclusion?|date=May 2018}} Cannibalism is also not restricted to [[carnivorous]] species, as it can be found in [[herbivore]]s and [[detritivore]]s.{{vague|which interpretation of the silence about the vegetable kingdom is intended?|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref name="Laurel R. Fox 1975"/&gt; Sexual cannibalism normally involves the consumption of the male by the female individual before, during or after copulation.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; Other forms of cannibalism include size-structured cannibalism and intrauterine cannibalism.

Behavioural, physiological and morphological adaptations have evolved to decrease the rate of cannibalism in individual species.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt;

== Benefits ==
In environments where food availability is constrained, individuals can receive extra nutrition and energy if they use other conspecific individuals as an additional food source. This would in turn increase the survival rate of the cannibal and thus provide an evolutionary advantage in environments where food is scarce.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;Snyder, W.E., Joseph, S.B., Preziosi, R.F. &amp; Moore, A.J. 2000, "Nutritional Benefits of Cannibalism for the Lady BeetleHarmonia axyridis(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) When Prey Quality is Poor", Environmental Entomology, vol. 29, no. 6, pp. 1173-1179.&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted on [[wood frog]] tadpoles showed that those that exhibited cannibalistic tendencies had faster growth rates and higher fitness levels than non-cannibals.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, D.M., Hobson, K.A., Demuth, B.S., Ferrari, M.C.O. &amp; Chivers, D.P. 2014, "Frugal cannibals: how consuming conspecific tissues can provide conditional benefits to wood frog tadpoles (Lithobates sylvaticus)", Naturwissenschaften, vol. 101, no. 4, pp. 291-303.&lt;/ref&gt; An increase of size and growth would give them the added benefit of protection from potential predators such as other cannibals and give them an advantage when competing for resources &lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt;

The nutritional benefits of cannibalism may allow for the more efficient conversion of a conspecific diet into reusable resources than fully herbaceous diet; as herbaceous diets may consist of excess elements which the animal has to expend energy to get rid of.&lt;ref name= "Simpson"&gt;.  Simpson, J., Joncour, B. &amp; Nelson, W.A. 2018, "Low levels of cannibalism increase fitness in an herbaceous tortrix moth", Behavioral Ecology and
Sociobiology, vol. 72, no. 2, pp.
1-11.
&lt;/ref&gt; This facilitates for faster development; however, a trade-off may occur as there may be less time to ingest these acquired resources. Studies have shown that there is a noticeable size difference between animals fed on a high conspecific diet which were smaller compared to those fed on a low conspecific diet.&lt;ref name= "Simpson"/&gt;  Hence, individual fitness could only be increased if the balance between developmental rate and size is balanced out, with studies showing that this is achieved in low conspecific diets.&lt;ref name= "Simpson"/&gt;

Cannibalism regulates population numbers and in turn benefits the cannibalistic individual and its kin as resources such as extra shelter, territory and food are freed; thereby increasing the fitness of the cannibal;&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt; by lowering crowding effects.&lt;ref&gt;Nishimura, K. &amp; Isoda, Y. 2004, "Evolution of cannibalism: referring to costs of cannibalism", Journal of Theoretical Biology, vol. 226, no. 3, pp. 293-302.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is only the case if the cannibal recognizes its own kin as this won't hinder any future chances of perpetuating its genes in future generations. The elimination of competition can also increase mating opportunities, allowing further spread of an individual's genes.

==Cost==
Animals which have diets consisting of mostly conspecific prey (a prey that belongs to the same species) expose themselves to a greater risk of injury and use more energy foraging, while there could be other alternative food sources available in their habitat, which could eventually entail less risk.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; 

In order to combat the risk of personal injury, a predator often targets younger or more vulnerable prey{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}. However, this predator's behavior may result -in some cases- in an increase to the cost associated with the time required to forage for a suitable prey, and consequently could result in a failure to meet the predator's self-set [[nutritional requirement]]s.&lt;ref&gt; Chapman, J.W. 1999, "Fitness consequences of cannibalism in [[Spodoptera frugiperda]] (fall armyworm), Behavioral Ecology, vol. 10, no. 3, pp. 298-303.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the consumption of conspecific prey may also involve the ingestion of defence compounds and [[hormone]]s which may impact the developmental growth of the cannibal&lt;ref name= "Simpson"/&gt; Hence, predators normally partake in a cannibalistic diet in conditions where alternative food sources are absent or not as readily available.

Failure to recognize kin preys would also be a disadvantage if cannibals were to consume younger individuals. For example, a male [[stickleback]] fish may often mistake their own "eggs" for their competitor's eggs, and hence would inadvertently eliminate some of its own genes from the available [[gene pool]].&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; Kin recognition has been observed in [[tadpole]]s of the spadefoot toad, whereby cannibalistic tadpoles of the same clutch tended to avoid consuming and harming siblings, while eating other non-siblings.&lt;ref name= "Pfennig"&gt;.  Pfennig, D.W., Reeve, H.K. &amp; Sherman, P.W. 1993, "Kin recognition and cannibalism in spadefoot toad tadpoles", Animal Behaviour, vol. 46, no. 1, pp. 87-94.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The act of cannibalism may also encourage the spread of diseases within a population which could negatively impact on the cannibal's fitness levels.&lt;ref name= "Rudolf"/&gt;

== Diseases transmitted through cannibalism ==

Cannibalism can potentially reduce the prevalence of [[Parasitism|parasites]] in the population by decreasing the number of susceptible hosts and indirectly killing the parasite in the host.&lt;ref name= "Benjamin"&gt;. Benjamin G Van Allen, Dillemuth, F.P., Flick, A.J., Faldyn, M.J., Clark, D.R., Volker H W Rudolf &amp; Elderd, B.D. 2017, "Cannibalism and Infectious Disease: Friends or Foes?", The American Naturalist, vol. 190, no. 3, pp. 299-312.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown in some studies that the risk of encountering an infected victim increases when there is a higher cannibalism rate, though this risk drops as the number of available hosts decreases.&lt;ref name= "Benjamin"/&gt; However, this is only the case if the risk of disease transmission is low.&lt;ref name= "Rudolf"/&gt; Cannibalism is an ineffective method of disease spread as cannibalism in the animal kingdom is normally a one-on-one interaction, and the spread of disease requires group cannibalism; thereby it is rare for a disease to have evolved to rely solely on cannibalism to spread. Usually there are different means of transmission, such as with direct contact, maternal transmission, [[Coprophagia|coprophagy]], and [[Scavenger|necrophagy]] with different species.&lt;ref name= "Rudolf"/&gt; Infected individuals are more likely to be consumed than non-infected individuals, thus some research has suggested that the spread of disease may be a limiting factor to the prevalence of cannibalism in the population.&lt;ref name= "Benjamin"/&gt;
 
Some examples of diseases transmitted by cannibalism in mammals include [[Kuru (disease)|Kuru]] which is a prion disease that degenerates the brain.&lt;ref name= "Rudolf"/&gt; This disease is prevalent in [[Papua New Guinea]] whereby tribes practice [[endocannibalism]] in cannibalistic funeral rituals and consume the brains infected by these prions.&lt;ref name= "Prusiner"&gt;. Prusiner, S.B. 2008, "Reflections on Kuru", Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences, vol. 363, no. 1510, pp. 3654-3656.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Cerebellum|cerebellar]] dysfunctional disease which has symptoms including a broad-based [[gait]] and decreased motor activity control; however, the disease has a long incubation rate and symptoms may not appear until years later.&lt;ref name= "Prusiner"/&gt;

[[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]], or mad cow disease is another prion disease which is usually caused by feeding contaminated bovine tissue to other cattle.&lt;ref name= "Finberg"&gt;. Finberg, K.E. 2004, "Mad cow disease in the United States: an update on bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease", Clinical
Microbiology Newsletter, vol. 26,
no. 15, pp. 113-118.
&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease and could be spread to humans if the individual were to consume contaminated beef. The spread of parasites such as [[nematodes]] may also be facilitated by cannibalism as eggs from these parasites are transferred more easily from one host to another.&lt;ref name= "Rudolf"/&gt;

Other forms of diseases include [[sarcocystis]] and [[iridovirus]] in reptiles and amphibians; granulosus virus, [[chagas disease]], and [[microsporidia]] in insects; stained prawn disease, white pot syndrome, [[helminthes]] and [[tapeworms]] in crustaceans and fish.&lt;ref name= "Rudolf"/&gt;

== Foraging dynamics ==
Cannibalism may become apparent when direct competition for limited resources forces individuals to use other conspecific individuals as an additional resource to maintain their metabolic rates.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; Hunger drives individuals to increase their foraging rates, which in turn decreases their attack threshold and tolerance to other conspecific individuals. As resources dwindle, individuals are forced to change their behaviour which may lead to [[animal migration]],&lt;ref&gt;Milner-Gulland, E.J., Fryxell, J.M. &amp; Sinclair, A.R.E. 2011, Animal migration: a synthesis, Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; confrontation, or cannibalism.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt;

Cannibalism rates increase with increasing population density as it becomes more advantageous to prey on conspecific organisms than to forage in the environment.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; This is because the encounter rate between predator and prey increases, making cannibalism more convenient and beneficial than foraging within the environment. Over time, the dynamics within the population changes as those with cannibalistic tendencies may receive additional nutritional benefits and increase the size ratio of predator to prey.&lt;ref&gt;Brose, U., Ehnes, R.B., Rall, B.C., Vucic-Pestic, O., Berlow, E.L. &amp; Scheu, S. 2008, "Foraging Theory Predicts Predator-Prey Energy Fluxes", Journal of Animal Ecology, vol. 77, no. 5, pp. 1072-1078.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of smaller prey, or prey which are at a vulnerable stage of their life cycle, increases the chances of cannibalism occurring due to the reduced risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, B. &amp; Long, W.C. 2014, "Inter-cohort cannibalism of early benthic phase blue king crabs (Paralithodes platypus): alternate foraging strategies in different habitats lead to different functional responses", PLOS One, vol. 9, no. 2, pp. e88694.&lt;/ref&gt; A feedback loop occurs when increasing rates of cannibalism decreases population densities, leading to an increased abundance of alternative food sources; making it more beneficial to forage within the environment than for cannibalism to occur.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; When population numbers and foraging rates increase, the carrying capacity for that resource in the area may be reached, thus forcing individuals to look for other resources such as conspecific prey.

== Sexual cannibalism ==
{{main|Sexual cannibalism}}

Sexual cannibalism is present largely in spiders and other [[invertebrate]]s, including [[Gastropoda|gastropods]].&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; This refers to the killing and consumption of [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] sexual partners during courtship, and during or after copulation. Normally, it is the female which consumes the conspecific male organism, though there have been some reported cases of the male consuming the adult female, however, this has only been recorded under laboratory conditions.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ib.berkeley.edu/courses/ib160/past_papers/suttle.html |title=The Evolution of Sexual Cannibalism |author=Kenwyn Blake Suttle |year=1999 |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isopod"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;issn=0278-0372&amp;volume=023&amp;issue=03&amp;page=0662 |title=Cannibalism within mating pairs of the parasitic isopod ''Ichthyoxenus fushanensis'' |author=Min-Li Tsai &amp; Chang-Feng Dai |journal=[[Journal of Crustacean Biology]] |volume=23 |issue=3 |year=2003 |pages=662–668 |doi=10.1651/C-2343 |format=abstract page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual cannibalism has been recorded in the female [[redback spider]], [[latrodectus|black widow spider]], [[Mantodea|praying mantis]], and [[scorpion]], among others.

In most species of spiders, the consumption of the male individual occurs before [[Sexual intercourse|copulation]] and the male fails to transfer his sperm into the female.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; This may be due to mistaken identity such as in the case of the [[Orb-weaver spider|orb weaving spider]] which holds little tolerance to any spider which are present in its web and may mistake the vibrations to be that of a prey item.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; Other reasons for male consumption before mating may include female choice and the nutritional advantages of cannibalism.&lt;ref name= "ElgarF"&gt;Elgar, M.A. &amp; Fahey, B.F. 1996, "Sexual cannibalism, competition, and size dimorphism in the orb-weaving spider Nephila plumipes Latreille (Araneae: Araneoidea)", Behavioral
Ecology, vol. 7, no. 2, pp.
195-198.&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the male spider may play a part in determining its reproductive success as smaller males are less likely to be consumed during pre-copulation; however, larger males may be able to prevent the smaller ones from gaining access to the female.&lt;ref name= "ElgarF"/&gt;
There exists a conflict of interest between males and females, as females may be more inclined to turn to cannibalism as a source of nutritional intake while the male's interest is mostly focused on ensuring paternity of the future generations.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; It was found that cannibalistic females produced offspring with greater survival rates than non-cannibalistic females, as cannibals produced greater [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] and larger egg sizes.&lt;ref&gt;Welke, K.W. &amp; Schneider, J.M. 2012, "Sexual cannibalism benefits offspring survival", Animal Behaviour, vol. 83, no. 1, pp. 201-207.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, species such as the male [[Dolomedes tenebrosus|dark fishing spider]] of the family [[dolomedes]] self-sacrifice and spontaneously die during copulation to facilitate for their own consumption by the female, thereby increasing the chance of survivorship of future offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, S., Wagner, W. &amp; Hebets, E. 2016, "Males Can Benefit from Sexual Cannibalism Facilitated by Self-Sacrifice", Current
Biology, vol. 26, no. 20, pp.
2794-2799.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual dimorphism]] has been theorised to have arisen from sexual selection as smaller males were captured more easily than larger males; however, it is also possible that sexual cannibalism only occurs due to the difference in size between male and females.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; Data comparing female and male spider body length shows that there is little support for the prior theory as there is not much correlation between body size and the presence of sexual cannibalism. Not all species of spiders which partake in sexual cannibalism exhibit size dimorphism.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt;

The avoidance of sexual cannibalism is present in many male species to increase their rate of survival, whereby the male uses cautionary methods to lower the risk of his consumption.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; Male orb weaving spiders would often wait for females to [[Moulting|moult]] or to finish eating before attempting to initiate mating, as the females are less likely to attack.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; Males which are vulnerable to post copulation consumption may gather mating thread to generate a mechanical tension which they could use to spring away after insemination, while other spiders such as the crab spider may tangle the female legs in webs to reduce the risk of the female capturing him.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; Male choice is common in [[Mantidae|mantids]] whereby males were observed to choose fatter females due to the reduced risk of attack and were more hesitant to approach starved females.&lt;ref&gt;Kadoi, M., Morimoto, K. &amp; Takami, Y. 2017, “Male mate choice in a sexually cannibalistic species: male escapes from hungry females in the praying mantid Tenodera angustipennis”, Journal of Ethology, vol. 35, no. 2, pp. 177-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Size-structured cannibalism ==
[[File:Mononchidae eating a Mononchidae 1.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Nematode]] [[Mononchidae]] eating another Mononchidae.]]

Size-structured cannibalism is cannibalism in which older, larger, more mature individuals consume smaller, younger [[conspecific]]s. In size-structured populations, (where populations are made of individuals of various sizes, ages, and maturities), cannibalism can be responsible for 8% ([[Belding's ground squirrel]]) to 95% ([[dragonfly]] [[larva]]e) of the total mortality,&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Polis, The evolution and dynamics of intraspecific predation. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 12, 225-251 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; making it a significant and important factor for population&lt;ref&gt;David Claessen, A. M. De Roos, and L. Persson, Population dynamic theory of size-dependent cannibalism. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences 271 (1537), 333-340 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and community dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;V. H. W. Rudolf, Consequences of stage-structured predators: Cannibalism, behavioral effects and trophic cascades. Ecology 88, 2991-3003 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Size-structured cannibalism has commonly been observed in the wild for a variety of [[taxa]]. Vertebrate examples include [[chimpanzee]]s, where groups of adult males have been observed to attack and consume infants.&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Arcadi and R. W. Wrangham, Infanticide in chimpanzees: Review of cases and a new within-group observation from the Kanyawara study group in [[Kibale National Park]]. Primates 40 (2), 337-351 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Wilson, W. R. Wallauer, and A. E. Pusey, New cases of intergroup violence among chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. International Journal of Primatology 25 (3), 523-549 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. P. Watts, J. C. Mitani, and H. M. Sherrow, New cases of inter-community infanticide by male chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Primates 43 (4), 263-270 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filial cannibalism ===
{{main|Filial cannibalism}}

Filial cannibalism is a specific type of size-structured cannibalism in which adults eat their own offspring.&lt;ref name="Rohwer, S 1978"&gt;Rohwer, S. 1978. Parent Cannibalism of Offspring and Egg Raiding as a Courtship Strategy. American Naturalist 112:429-440.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most often thought of as parents eating live young, filial cannibalism includes parental consumption of [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] infants and [[miscarriage|miscarried]] fetuses as well as infertile and still-incubating eggs. Vertebrate examples include [[pig]]s, where [[savaging]] accounts for a sizable percentage of total piglet deaths, and [[cat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.messybeast.com/kill_kit.htm Hartwell, S, Cats that kill kittens]&lt;/ref&gt;

Filial cannibalism is particularly common in [[teleost]] fishes, appearing in at least seventeen different families of teleosts.&lt;ref&gt;Manica, A. 2002. Filial cannibalism in teleost fish. Biological Reviews 77:261-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this diverse group of fish, there have been many, variable explanations of the possible adaptive value of filial cannibalism. One of these is the energy-based hypothesis, which suggests that fish eat their offspring when they are low on energy as an investment in future reproductive success.&lt;ref name="Rohwer, S 1978"/&gt; This has been supported by experimental evidence, showing that male [[three-spined stickleback]]s,&lt;ref name="Rohwer, S 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehlis, M. 2010"&gt;Mehlis, M., T. C. M. Bakker, L. Engqvist, and J. G. Frommen. 2010. To eat or not to eat: egg-based assessment of paternity triggers fine-tuned decisions about filial cannibalism. Proceedings of the Royal Society B-Biological Sciences 277:2627-2635.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mehlis, M., T. C. M. Bakker, and J. G. Frommen. 2009. Nutritional benefits of filial cannibalism in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Naturwissenschaften 96:399-403.&lt;/ref&gt; male [[tessellated darter]]s,&lt;ref&gt;DeWoody, J. A., D. E. Fletcher, S. D. Wilkins, and J. C. Avise. 2001. Genetic documentation of filial cannibalism in nature. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 98:5090-5092.&lt;/ref&gt; and male [[sphinx blenny]] fish&lt;ref&gt;Kraak, S. B. M. 1996. Female preference and filial cannibalism in Aidablennius sphynx (Teleostei, Blenniidae); a combined field and laboratory study. Behavioural Processes 36:85-97.&lt;/ref&gt; all consume or absorb their own eggs to maintain their physical conditions. In other words, when males of a fish species are low on energy, it might sometimes be beneficial for them to feed on their own offspring to survive and invest in future reproductive success.

Another hypothesis as to the adaptive value of filial cannibalism in [[teleost]]s is that it increases density-dependent egg survivorship. In other words, filial cannibalism simply increases overall reproductive success by helping the other eggs make it to maturity by thinning out the numbers. Possible explanations as to why this is so include increasing oxygen availability to the remaining eggs,&lt;ref&gt;Payne, A. G., C. Smith, and A. C. Campbell. 2002. Filial cannibalism improves survival and development of beaugregory damselfish embryos. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences 269:2095-2102.&lt;/ref&gt; the negative effects of accumulating embryo waste,&lt;ref name="Klug, H. 2006"&gt;Klug, H., K. Lindstrom, and C. M. S. Mary. 2006. Parents benefit from eating offspring: density-dependent egg survivorship compensates for filial cannibalism. Evolution 60:2087-2095.&lt;/ref&gt; and predation.&lt;ref name="Klug, H. 2006"/&gt;

In some species of eusocial wasps, such as ''[[Polistes chinensis]]'', the reproducing female will kill and feed younger larvae to her older brood. This occurs under food stressed conditions in order to ensure that the first generation of workers emerges without delay.&lt;ref&gt;Kudo, K.; Shirai, A. (5 January 2012). "Effect of food availability on larval cannibalism by foundresses of the paper wasp Polistes chinensis antennalis". Insect Soc. 59: 279–284.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further evidence also suggests that occasionally filial cannibalism might be the unfortunate by-product of [[cuckoldry in fish]]. Males consume broods, which may include their own offspring, when they believe a certain percentage of the brood contains genetic material that is not theirs.&lt;ref name="Mehlis, M. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, S. M., L. M. Dill, and J. S. McKinnon. 2007. Cuckoldry incites cannibalism: male fish turn to cannibalism when perceived certainty of paternity decreases. American Naturalist 169:258-263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dinosaur]] ''[[Coelophysis]]'' was once suspected to practice this form of cannibalism but this turned out to be wrong, although ''[[Deinonychus]]'' may have done. Skeletal remains from subadults with missing parts are suspected of having been eaten by other ''Deinonychus'', mainly full-grown adults.

=== Infanticide ===
{{main|Infanticide (zoology)}}

Infanticide is the killing of a non-adult animal by an adult of the same species. Infanticide is often, but not always, accompanied by cannibalism. It is often displayed in [[lions]]; a male lion encroaching on the territory of a rival pride will often kill any existing cubs fathered by other males; this brings the lionesses into heat more quickly, enabling the invading lion to sire his own young. This is a good example of cannibalistic behavior in a genetic context.

In many species of [[Lepidoptera]], such as ''[[Small blue|Cupido minimus]]'' and the [[Indian mealmoth]], the first larvae to hatch will consume the other eggs or smaller larvae on the host plant to decrease competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/species.php?species=minimus|title=Small Blue|last=Eeles|first=Peter|date=|website=UK Butterflies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boots|first=Michael|date=1998-05-01|title=Cannibalism and the stage-dependent transmission of a viral pathogen of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2311.1998.00115.x/abstract|journal=Ecological Entomology|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=118–122|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2311.1998.00115.x|issn=1365-2311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intrauterine cannibalism ==
{{further|Oophagy}}
[[Sibling rivalry (animals)#Intrauterine cannibalism|Intrauterine cannibalism]] is a behaviour in some carnivorous species, in which multiple embryos are created at impregnation, but only one or two are born.  The larger or stronger ones consume their less-developed siblings as a source of nutrients.

In '''adelphophagy&lt;!--redirects here--&gt;''' or embryophagy, the fetus eats sibling embryos, while in [[oophagy]] it feeds on eggs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thierry Lodé]] 2001. Les stratégies de reproduction des animaux (reproduction strategies in animal kingdom). Eds Dunod Sciences, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crespi&gt;{{cite journal | last = Crespi | first = Bernard |author2=Christina Semeniuk | title = Parent-Offspring Conflict in the Evolution of Vertebrate Reproductive Mode | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 163 | issue = 5 | pages = 635–654 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1086/382734 | id = | pmid = 15122484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adelphophagy occurs in some marine gastropods ([[calyptraeid]]s, [[muricid]]s, [[vermetid]]s, and [[buccinid]]s) and in some marine [[annelid]]s (''[[Boccardia proboscidia]]'' in [[Spionidae]]).&lt;ref&gt;Thomsen O., Collin R. &amp; Carrillo-Baltodano A.

Viviparity and intrauterine feeding in a new holocephalan fish from the Lower Carboniferous of Montana. Science, 209: 697‑699.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection against cannibalism==
Animals have evolved protection to prevent and deter potential predators such as those from their own kind.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; Many amphibian eggs are gelatinous and toxic to decrease edibility. Often, adults would lay their eggs in crevices, holes, or empty nesting sites to hide their eggs from potential conspecific predators which tend to ingest the eggs for an additional nutritional benefit or to get rid of genetic competition. In amphibians, the development of non-aquatic egg deposition has helped increase the survival rates of their young by the evolution of viviparity or direct development.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt; In bees, worker policing occurs to prohibit worker reproduction, whereby workers cannibalize other worker laid eggs.&lt;ref name="Santomauro"&gt;Santomauro, G., Oldham, N.J., Boland, W. &amp; Engels, W. 2004, "Cannibalism of diploid drone larvae in the honey bee (Apis mellifera) is released by odd pattern of cuticular substances", Journal of Apicultural Research, vol. 43, no. 2, pp. 69-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Queen laid eggs have a different scent than worker laid eggs, allowing workers differentiate between the two, allowing them to nurture and protect queen laid eggs rather than cannibalising them.&lt;ref name="Santomauro" /&gt; Parental presence at nesting sites is also a common method of protection against infanticide committed by conspecific individuals, whereby the parent exhibit defensive displays to ward off potential predators. Parental investment in newborns are generally higher during their early stages of development whereby behaviours such as aggression, territorial behaviour, and pregnancy blocking become more apparent.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt;
 
Morphological plasticity helps an individual account for different predation stresses, thereby increasing individual survival rates.&lt;ref name="Kishida"&gt;Kishida, O., Trussell, G.C., Nishimura, K. &amp; Ohgushi, T. 2009, "Inducible Defenses in Prey Intensify Predator Cannibalism", Ecology, vol. 90, no. 11, pp. 3150-3158.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese brown frog tadpoles have been shown to exhibit morphological plasticity when they are in a high stress environment where cannibalism between tadpoles and more developed individuals were present. Shifting their morphology plays a key role in their survival, creating bulkier bodies when put into environments where more developed tadpoles were present, to make it difficult for the individuals to swallow them whole.&lt;ref name="Kishida" /&gt; Diet shifts between different stages of development have also evolved to decrease competition between each stage, thereby increasing the amount of food availability so that there is a decreased chance that the individuals will turn to cannibalism as an additional food source.&lt;ref name= "Elgar"/&gt;

The '''caridoid escape reaction''', also known as '''lobstering''' or '''tail-flipping''', refers to an innate escape mechanism in marine and freshwater [[crustacean]]s such as [[lobster]]s, [[krill]], [[shrimp]] and [[crayfish]].

The reaction, most extensively researched in crayfish, allows crustaceans to escape predators through rapid abdominal flexions that produce powerful swimming strokes—thrusting the crustacean backwards through the water and away from danger.&lt;ref name=Krasne1987&gt;{{citation

==Discovery of the first command neuron-mediated behavior==
[[File:Procambarus clarkii top.jpg|thumb|left|The tail-flip escape behavior was first described in the crayfish ''[[Procambarus clarkii]]'']]

In 1946, [[C. A. G. Wiersma]] first described the tail-flip escape in the crayfish ''[[Procambarus clarkii]]'' and noted that the giant [[interneuron]]s present in the tail were responsible for the reaction. The aforementioned neuronal fibres consist of a pair of lateral giant interneurons and a pair of medial giant interneurons, and Wiersma found that stimulating just one '''[[lateral giant interneuron]]''' ('''LG or LGI''') or one '''[[medial giant interneuron]]''' ('''MG or MGI''') would result in the execution of a tail flip. Wiersma and K. Ikeda then proposed the term "command neuron" in their 1964 publication, and applied it to the giant interneuron's ability to command the expression of the escape response.  This was the first description of a [[command neuron]]-mediated behavior and it indicated that the [[depolarization]] of a neuron could precipitate complex innate behaviors in some organisms.&lt;ref name=Carew2000&gt;{{Citation

This concept was further fleshed out with more specific and stringent conditions in 1972 when Kupfermann and Weiss published ''The Command Neuron Concept''. The paper stated that command neurons were neurons (or small sets of neurons) carrying the entire command signal for a natural behavioral response. According to the authors, command neurons were both necessary and sufficient in the production of a behavioral response.&lt;ref name=Kupfermann1978&gt;{{citation

==Research with crayfish==
Behavioral neurobiologists in the field of [[neuroethology]] have researched this behavior extensively for over fifty years in the crayfish species ''[[Procambarus clarkii]]''.&lt;ref name="Edwards1999" /&gt; Based on studies of ''P. clarkii'' it was discovered that the tail- flip mechanism is characterized by a decisive, all-or-nothing quality that inhibits  all unnecessary behaviors while generating a [[fixed action pattern]] for escape swimming.&lt;ref name=Camhi1984&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;!-- chapter 8 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The type of [[escape response]] depends on the region of the crayfish that is stimulated but all forms require abdominal contractions. When a strong, unpleasant tactile stimulus is presented, such as a burst of water or the prod of a probe, a stereotyped behavior occurs in which the muscular tail and wide tail fan region of the [[telson]] are used like a paddle to propel the crustacean away from harm using a powerful abdominal flexions.  The entire process occurs in a fraction of a second as movements are generated within two hundredths of a second (20 milliseconds) from the original trigger stimulus and the period of latency after a flexion is a hundredth of a second (10 milliseconds).&lt;ref name="Carew2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Camhi1984"/&gt; Finally, the caridoid escape reflex requires that neurons be able to complete the arduous task of synchronizing the flexion of several abdominal segments.  The speed, coordination, and decisiveness of the process seem to be the main attributes to its success.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wine1972&gt;{{citation

===Anatomy involved===
Like other [[Decapoda|decapod]] crustaceans, the crayfish possesses a hard, segmented [[exoskeleton]] that reflects muscular and neural segmentation. The anterior portion of the crayfish is the cephalothorax region. The region rostral to the cephalic grove, which separates the head and thorax region, is characterized by the presence of eyes, antennae and claws while the region caudal contains four pairs of walking legs. This is the crayfish's primary mode of locomotion.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiersma1947" /&gt; The abdominal section of the crayfish is divided into seven segments. These segments are flexibly interconnected, forming the tail. Normally, the tail is held in an extended position to aid in maneuvering and balancing. The first five segments are similar and the two terminal segments are modified into a '''tail fan''', a region with high surface area that acts as the blade of a paddle in the escape response. This region contains the [[telson]]. The abdominal segments contain '''swimmerets''', which aid in swimming.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;

The anterior five segments of the crayfish house the massive [[flexor]] and [[extensor]] [[muscle]]s. Six abdominal [[ganglia]] run down the entire length of the abdomen and communicate with one another through projections.&lt;ref name="Wiersma1947" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiersma1964" /&gt; The first five abdominal segments each have their own ganglion, that contains three roots with outward projections. The first has mixed sensory and [[motor nerve]]s innervating swimmerets while the second has sensory and [[motor neuron]]s that innervate the extensor muscles, while the third root contains only motor neuron projections that extend into the flexor muscles. The last segment contains the fusion of two ganglia. The ganglia here also receive sensory input from the sensitive hairs on the tail fan.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wine1972" /&gt;

Each ganglion contains the body of one '''motor giant neuron''' ('''MoG'''), powerful and large bodied motor neurons whose projections innervate the five '''fast flexor''' ('''FF''') muscles found in a segment and interact with them through [[chemical synapse]]s. The ganglia also contain two sets of giant [[axon]]s known as the lateral giant neurons and the medial giant neurons. These interneurons play important roles in escape swimming. Their large diameter allows for rapid conduction since there is less current leakage.&lt;ref name=Ewert1980&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their projections extend through the third root in each ganglion, and Furshpan and Potter found that they synapses they subsequently made with the '''MoG''' passed depolarizing currents in a direct and unidirectional manner. These electrical synapses account for the speed of the escape mechanism and display some features of [[chemical synapse]]s such as LTP and LTD.&lt;ref name="Edwards1999" /&gt; Variations in escape response characteristic depend on the location where the crayfish body is prodded or attacked and also depend on which of the giant neurons is stimulated.

===Response variants and their circuitry===

====Medial giant-mediated escape====
The medial giants innervate the entire ventral nerve chord. Their cell bodies and [[dendrite]]s begin in the brain and collect sensory information presented by visual and [[Touch|tactile]] [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. These fibers terminate in the last abdominal segment. The response is triggered by abrupt tactile stimuli to the head or alarming visual stimuli. This results in the firing of all '''motor giant''' ('''MoG''') neurons and the flexion of all the phasic '''fast flexor''' ('''FF''') muscles in the abdomen, which rapidly curls the tail fan and last three segments underneath the crayfish. This produces a thrust that directs water towards the offending stimulus while propelling the crayfish directly backward. This behavior is then followed by the extension of the tail, which prepares it for swimming or the execution of another tail-flip.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt; The extension and swimming phases will be discussed in the next escape variant.

Unfortunately, this variant of the tail-flip escape has not been extensively studied. Further studies should focus on this escape variant, paying special attention to exactly how visual information is processed and then converted into neuronal signals that produce a tail flip response.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;

====Non-giant escape====
Less abrupt or gradually intensifying stimuli evoke locomotion behavior similar to that seen in giant interneuron-mediated behaviors. However, the movements are less stereotyped and do not appear to occur in an all or nothing manner.&lt;ref name="Wine1972" /&gt; They are so named because they lack the involvement of the giant interneurons, most likely because they do not produce depolarizations in the sensory neurons that are  above the thresholds required to initiate these behaviors. Instead they involve one or a few of the smaller neurons innervating the tail. The latency periods for these escape mechanisms are longer, ranging from 80 to 500&amp;nbsp;ms. However, this slower swimming behavior allows for flexibility, since the crayfish can use visual stimuli and steer itself in a selected direction.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reichert1983&gt;{{citation

Non-giant escape often occurs during situations where lateral or medial giant-mediated escape may not be beneficial or during times where those behaviors are suppressed. This allows the crayfish to attack offenders, escape during feeding, or wriggle free when it has been restrained by the carapace.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;

Non-giant escape circuitry was found to be activated more during frontal attacks, but was rarely involved in the initial escape during a rear attack. Non-giant escape is often used after an initial giant interneuron-mediated tail flip. Compared to MG escape, the potentials produced in the MoG neurons by non-giant circuitry have lower amplitudes and longer durations while the recordings in the FF muscles are more erratic and have smaller amplitudes since they receive smaller EPSPs from the MoGs. So while it is hard to observe differences in MG and non-escapes, this property can be used to distinguish the two.&lt;ref name=Kramer1984&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lateral giant-mediated escape====
The '''lateral giant (LG)'''-mediated escape mechanism is the most extensively analyzed form of the tail flip.  The LG is not actually one neuron, but rather a group of closely associated neurons arranged end to end and connected by electrical synapses (also called  '''septate synapses'''). As a result, the LGI functions as one giant, continuous  neuron, such as the MG.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt; The LGI's large diameter and the efficiency and speed of electrical synapses, make the LGI-mediated escape especially rapid and effective. The LGI only innervates the first three rostral segments of the tail and  is activated within 10 ms from when a mechanical stimulus is presented to the abdomen. When flexion occurs, only the first three segments flex and the tail fan is not directed under the body and forward but rather straight down. The unflexed segments increase the length of the paddle. The result is the rear end of the animal is directed upward and forward causing the animal to tumble or somersault forward. The tail is then rapidly extended, and this is usually followed by directed swimming.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Camhi1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wine1972" /&gt;

The LGI is one of the few examples of a true command neuron. It passes the necessity and sufficiency principle put forward by Kupfermann and Weiss. Wiersma's initial experiments showed that direct stimulation of the LGI was a sufficient release for the tail flip.&lt;ref name="Wiersma1947" /&gt; In 1981, it was Olson and Krasne who showed that the LGI fulfilled the condition of necessity, because when spikes were inhibited in the LGI through introducing a hyperpolarizing current, no motor activity was produced in response to a stimulus that would have originally elicited the tail flip.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;

The LGI contains the following three phases, occurring over the span of about 100&amp;thinsp;ms:

=====1 – Flexion production=====
The LGI receives its sensory input from the hair-like projections found on the edge of the tail fan. The sensory information is sent from bipolar receptors connected to the hair that are directionally sensitive. The path of the signal varies from here depending on the strength of the input. In the '''beta pathway''', the signal can then pass a chemical synapse, the information is sent to a '''sensory interneuron''' ('''SI''') of either type A (which fires phasically in response to input) or type C, (which fire tonically). From there, the signal is sent across an electrical synapse to the LGI. The LGI can also receive the sensory input directly through an electrical synapse by way of the '''alpha pathway'''. This bypasses the SIs. The LGI can pass the signal to the MoG's by two paths one of which passes the signal to the Motor Giant through direct electrical synapses. The MoG then passes the signal to the FF muscles. It can also use a second route across a fast electrical synapse to a premotor interneuron called the '''segmental giant''' ('''SG'''), two of which are located in each segment. The SGs then relays the signal to fast flexor motor neurons. The end result is a powerful and rapid flexion.&lt;ref name="Krasne1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Camhi1984"/&gt;

The convergence many inputs on the LGI and divergence of few signals show how the LGI functions as a decision making coincidence detector. It takes the information from both the alpha and the beta pathways and  if the timing of the spikes is synchronous, the behavior is produced. If the timing is asynchronous, the later input is blocked by reducing the driving force of the signal and increasing the threshold voltage. The early synapse also causes current to leak through the active synapse, resulting in weak EPSPs that are ultimately unable to generate the tail flip.&lt;ref name="Edwards1999" /&gt;

A number of processes are inhibited once the initial flexion has begun. Further LGI spiking, influx of sensory information from the tail, MoG spiking and FF contraction are all inhibited so that a flexion and extension cycle can be completed before another flexion begins. Long IPSPs are generated to prevent these events.  The extensor muscles are inhibited to prevent competition between the extensor and flexors. Rapid IPSPs presented at the muscle receptor organ (MRO)  prevent the stretch receptor from initiating extension while they are also presented at the fast extensor motor neurons and the fast extensor muscles. The circuits responsible for slow flexion and extension are also inhibited.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reichert1983" /&gt;

=====2 – Reextension=====
When the LGI-mediated inhibition subsides, the reextension process begins. This process is mediated by the MRO and tail fan hair receptors, which were inhibited during the flexion portion of the escape behavior. The MRO is responsible for the initiation of extension and the inhibition of flexion through a reflex like mechanism. The [[myocyte|muscle fibers]] of the MRO are located on the dorsal side of the abdomen, each spanning the joint of two segments. They are innervated by proprioreceptors that detect the stretch in extensor muscles when the flexors are contracted. They then fire phasically or tonically. It then excites the motor neurons in the fast extensor muscles while directly exciting an inhibitory neuron that prevents contractions in the FF muscles. The [[hair cell]]s detect the resulting movement caused by the tail flip  when activated, they would fire and excite the fast extensor motor neurons.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wine1984&gt;{{citation

|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====3 – Swimming=====
Non-giant-mediated responses are initiated after the tail flip, creating cycles of flexion followed by extension. This non-giant system is activated parallel to the LGI circuit when the hair cells receive input. However, this behavior has a longer delay that allows the onset of swimming to occur after the completion of the tail flip. The non-giant swimming occurs independently of the  LGI response since direct stimulation of the LGI with the electrodes results in a tail flip but not the subsequent non-giant swimming. This swimming response seems to be a fixed action pattern mediated by a central pattern generator since it does not require [[sensory feedback]] for physical and temporal maintenance.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wine1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herberholz2004" /&gt;

===Modulation and plasticity of the response===
The production of a tail flip is not always beneficial. Evolution has allowed the crayfish to be more flexible by presenting several control systems that will prevent the tail flip in situations where it will most likely be unnecessary or ineffective.

====Eating====
Crayfish often find themselves in a conflicting situation where they are performing the highly motivated behavior of feeding when they suddenly receive a tail flip stimulus. Often, the crayfish will not perform a tail flip in this situation. This is because when a crayfish is actively feeding, the LGI itself is modulated by the behavior. Feeding increases the threshold for the tail flip, and even when the tail is tapped, no spikes are initiated. As a result, it takes an especially strong stimulus to elicit the tail flip. This prevents the crayfish from going hungry unless it is absolutely necessary.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;

====Carapace restraint====
When a crayfish is held by its carapace either in the water or in the air, it does not respond with a tail flip when it receives sensory stimuli that would normally elicit the response. This inhibitory behavior does not seem to be mediated by the abdomen. When the thorax-abdomen junction is severed, the inhibitory effect is lost and the LGI in severed abdomen generates strong spikes since its threshold had decreased substantially. This is an indication that the behavior is mediated in the brain or the thorax of the crayfish.&lt;ref name="Krasne1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt; Most non-giant and MGI tail flips are also suppressed by restraint, so only a few non-giant systems are active to allow the crayfish to carefully wriggle free. The setup of this system seems to be designed to prevent the unnecessary use of all or nothing tail flips or ineffective tail flips when the situation requires more careful maneuvering.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;

The tail flip normally induces inhibition in an absolute fashion, such that it takes precedence over all the other tasks the segments are performing. However, during these situations, the effectiveness of the tail flip is reduced, so the inhibitory processes need to occur in a relative manner and a tail flip should occur only if absolutely necessary. During absolute inhibition is directed by more proximal synapses controlling the [[spike-initiating zone]]s of the LGI.  
It is most likely that during restraint or feeding, the inhibitory process is mediated by inhibitory synaptic input on distal dendrites of the LGI . As a result, these signals would have to compete with other inputs for the control of the LGI.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vu1993&gt;{{citation

====Learning====
Repeated tapping of the abdomen leads to habituation of the tail flip mechanism. However, self–habituation is prevented by command neuron–derived inhibition because when a tail flip is begun, the mechanisms that induce habituation are repressed. The habituation occurs at the level of the A type and C type interneurons, which experience synaptic depression. The habituation process is also mediated further up the circuit through the buildup of tonic inhibition, brought on by the repeated stimulation.&lt;ref name=Carew2000 /&gt;

====Social status====
The feedback from social situations affect a crayfish's ability to perform a tail flip. Serotonin levels are affected by social status. High levels are associated with aggressive behavior and a reduction in the frequency of tail flips performed. This is because the excitability of the LGI is decreased. Aggressive dominant males have a moderate reduction in tail flips while the subordinates have a much lower occurrence of tail flips. This presents a paradox since this means that subordinates are more likely to get killed. However, it was found that subordinates are more likely to use non-giant-mediated escape, indicating that the reduction in tail flips and enhancement of non giant escape is adaptive.

Changes in social status should correlate with changes in serotonin levels, resulting in changes in the escape strategies used by the crayfish. However this is only true when submissive crayfish become dominant, and not the reverse. The neuromodulatory  processes of facilitation and inhibition seem to be mediated by different cell receptors. Differences in the effects of serotonin on the behavior of the crayfish seem to be the result of differences in the populations of these receptors. It is unknown how these modulation processes convey the information to the LG, and how the behavioral changes are precipitated.&lt;ref name="Edwards1999" /&gt;

===Evolution of the tail flip escape mechanism===
It has been hypothesized that the tail flip is derived from an ancient limb protraction driven (as opposed to tail flexion-driven) mechanism. This is because the SGs appear to be modified limb motor neurons whose peripheral axons affect the legs and swimmerets, but end blindly without any known function. It is known that another effect of Giant Fiber excitation is limb promotion which suggests that the premotor limb interneurons may be ancestors of the Giant Fibers.

It has been speculated that the ancestral escape mechanism was most likely a backwards jump due to the simultaneous protraction of the legs driven by the ancestors of the Giant Fibers. This behavior was probably similar to the escape system found in a [[mantis shrimp]] called ''Squilla'' that diverged from the crayfish lineage very early on. It is likely that this mechanism was replaced by the tail flip since the wide surface area of the tail made this behavior more selectively advantageous. This most likely occurred when the ancestral flexor motor neurons in each segment formed connections with one of these limb motor neurons. The ''Squilla'' mechanism seems be similar to this ancestral state because  a large diameter axon in the dorsal nerve chord facilitates limb promoter motor neurons. This seems to match the ancestral condition, but it is not known for sure whether the circuitry is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]].&lt;ref name="Edwards1999" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Caridoid'' is derived from the Greek ''karis'' or ''καρίς'' (pronun. kah-RISS),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AF%CF%82 καρίς]'' ''ΛΟΓΕΙΟΝ'' online Greek lexicon&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[shrimp]]'' or ''prawn'', which is the root of the name of the taxonomic infraorder ''[[Caridea]]'', a large group of crustaceans also known as the ''caridean shrimp''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8119">The '''Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing''' ('''CSTARS''') is a [[ground station]] that receives [[imagery]] data from a variety of [[remote sensing]] [[satellites]].  CSTARS is owned and operated by the [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]], a college within the [[University of Miami]].

[[File:CSTARS_logo.jpg|256px|right|thumb]]

==Overview==
CSTARS is a state-of-the-art real-time satellite reception and analysis facility located in southern [[Miami-Dade county, Florida]]. Its mission is collect [[satellite imagery]] for environmental monitoring of [[hurricanes]], [[volcanoes]], [[landslides]] and other natural or man made [[disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 "CSTARS yields new perspectives on Earth" Miami Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013213304/http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the University of Miami purchased the [[United States Naval Observatory]] Secondary National Time Standard Facility. The purchase included {{convert|78|acre|m2}} of land with several buildings and a 20-meter [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] once used for [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miami.edu/research/10oct2002.pdf "Research Notes" eVeritas]&lt;/ref&gt; This large antenna is currently used to support scientific communications with the [[Antarctic]] (on behalf of the [[National Science Foundation]]). Two 11 meter [[X-band]] antennas were added to create a high bandwidth data reception capability for the [[downlink]] of satellite image data. Scientists and staff perform research and analysis activities on-site as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars About CSTARS ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708043628/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station mask covers a very large area stretching from [[Hudson Bay]] in northeastern Canada down to northern [[South America]] in the south.  The mask includes [[Central America]], the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Caribbean Basin]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and much of the Eastern US including [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects CSTARS Coverage Area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708042258/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CSTARS provides a [[VoIP]] communication system for the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]].&lt;ref name=dhs/&gt;

CSTARS is located on the Richmond campus of the [[University of Miami]] at {{Coord|25.6137|-80.384|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/facility CSTARS Site Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708041603/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/facility |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hurricane Katrina Damage Assessment and Disaster Relief ==
CSTARS played a vital role in the damage assessment and relief efforts of [[New Orleans]] and the [[Gulf Coast]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ Soundings Sep. 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004074650/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ |date=October 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first remote sensing images illustrating the extent of the [[flooding]] in New Orleans were collected at CSTARS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spotimage.fr/web/en/910-new-orleans-usa.php SPOT Imagery of New Orleans, Aug. 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ==
The United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] has included CSTARS as one of its "Centers of Excellence" so that CSTARS will work with the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] to research [[port]] security and maritime [[Environmental monitoring|monitoring]] issues.&lt;ref name=dhs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/pressreleases/20080304-cstars.html|title=University of Miami’s CSTARS To Form Part of U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Center of Excellence for Maritime Security|work=Press Release|date=March 4, 2008|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2008/09/soundings_09-08.pdf CSTARS: PROTECTING OUR PORTS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725003309/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2008/09/soundings_09-08.pdf |date=July 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project with Office of Naval Research (ONR) ==
The [[Office of Naval Research]] awarded CSTARS a grant to support satellite based research studies on internal [[Swell (ocean)|waves]] and [[typhoons]] in the western [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/1,1770,2593-1;65847-3,00.html A Wave of Support for Satellite Research]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211031615/http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/1%2C1770%2C2593-1%3B65847-3%2C00.html |date=February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Palau ==
CSTARS participated in a [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] study to examine how to protect one of the largest Marine Protected (MPA) areas in the world through the utilization of commercially available earth imaging satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/05/palau_monitoring_control_and_surveillance.pdf ''The Republic of Palau Exclusive Economic Zone MONITORING, CONTROL, AND SURVEILLANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admiral James G. Stavridis on CSTARS ==
Admiral [[James Stavridis]], former commanding officer of [[United States Southern Command]], writes about CSTARS in his book [https://web.archive.org/web/20120819083952/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis.html ''Partnership for the Americas'']. In chapter 7 entitled "Innovation", he describes how CSTARS aided SOUTHCOM in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts during his tenure in the SOUTHCOM AOR (i.e., in Latin America and the Caribbean):

{{quotation|Another success story can be found in an academia innovation partnership formed with the University of Miami’s Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS). The concept of using CSTARS was to determine how well access to a constellation of unclassified commercial satellites could support traditional Southern Command missions. Initial demonstrations were conducted with promising results. Subsequent letters of endorsements and demand signals for future use of CSTARS were published and promulgated to various centers of excellence and a funding mechanism was established within Southern Command. Within a year of the initial CSTARS demonstrations, hurricanes ravaged Haiti in 2008 and Southern Command responded with assistance, including an impromptu emergency redeployment of USS Kearsarge from its previously scheduled mission. Assessment of inland damage caused by the hurricanes was a critical need to the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts, and CSTARS provided vital imagery to those operations to quickly determine areas of highest damage and evaluation of inland infrastructure. Unclassified CSTARS imagery and information were then rapidly broadcast and distributed to both DOD and interagency responders via unclassified email. This response was only possible due to the groundwork laid during the initial CSTARS demonstration and a long-term vision for follow-on support made possible by CSTARS to Southern Command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html ''Partnership for the Americas''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917043652/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html |date=September 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the field of psychology, '''cognitive dissonance''' is the [[Stress (psychological)|mental discomfort]] (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory [[belief]]s, [[idea]]s, or [[Value (ethics)|values]]. This discomfort is triggered by a situation in which a person’s belief clashes with new evidence perceived by that person. When confronted with facts that contradict personal beliefs, ideals, and values, people will find a way to resolve the contradiction in order to reduce their discomfort.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance''. California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Festinger | first1 = L. | year = 1962 | title = Cognitive dissonance | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 207 | issue = 4| pages = 93–107 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1062-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance'' (1957), [[Leon Festinger]] proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the [[Reality|real world]]. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and so is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance, by making changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance, or by actively avoiding social situations and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt;

== Relations among cognitions ==
To function in the [[reality]] of a modern society, human beings continually adjust the correspondence of their mental attitudes and personal actions; such continual adjustments, between cognition and action, result in one of three relationships with reality:&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt;
# Consonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions consistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out to dinner, and ordering water rather than wine)
# Irrelevant relationship: Two cognitions or actions unrelated to each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, and wearing a shirt)
# Dissonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions inconsistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, but then drinking more wine)

=== Magnitude of dissonance ===
The reduction of the [[psychological stress]] of cognitive dissonance is a function of the magnitude of the dissonance caused by the existential inconsistency, between two contradictory beliefs held by the person; or by the contradiction between the person's beliefs and an action he or she has taken.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; Two factors determine the degree of psychological dissonance caused by two conflicting cognitions or by two conflicting actions:
# The importance of cognitions: The greater the personal value of the elements, the greater the magnitude of the dissonance in the relation.
# Ratio of cognitions: The proportion of dissonant-to-consonant elements.

== Reduction==
Cognitive dissonance theory proposes that people seek psychological consistency between their personal expectations of life and the existential [[reality]] of the world. To function by that expectation of existential consistency, people continually reduce their cognitive dissonance in order to align their cognitions (perceptions of the world) with their actions.

The creation and establishment of psychological consistency allows the person afflicted with cognitive dissonance to lessen his or her mental stress by actions that reduce the magnitude of the dissonance, realised either by changing with or by justifying against, or by being indifferent to the existential contradiction that is inducing the mental stress.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt; In practice, people reduce the magnitude of their cognitive dissonance in four ways:
# Change the behavior or the cognition ("I'll eat no more of this doughnut.")
# Justify the behavior or the cognition, by changing the conflicting cognition ("I'm allowed to cheat my diet every once in a while.")
# Justify the behavior or the cognition by adding new cognitions ("I'll spend thirty extra minutes at the gymnasium to work off the doughnut.")
# Ignore or deny information that conflicts with existing beliefs ("This doughnut is not a high-sugar food.")

Three cognitive biases in particular are components of dissonance theory. The bias that one does not have any biases, the bias that one is "better, kinder, smarter, more moral, and nicer than average," and [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tavris |first1=Carol |authorlink1=Carol Tavris |last2=Aronson |first2=Elliot |authorlink2=Elliot Aronson |title=Why We Believe -- Long After We Shouldn't |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=51-53 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105182429/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/why_we_believe_long_after_we_shouldnt |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That a consistent psychology is required for functioning in the real world also was indicated in the results of ''The Psychology of Prejudice'' (2006), wherein people facilitate their functioning in the real world by employing human categories (i.e. sex and gender, age and race, etc.) with which they manage their social interactions with other people.

Likewise, the study ''Patterns of Cognitive Dissonance-reducing Beliefs Among Smokers: A Longitudinal Analysis from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey'' (2012) indicated that smokers use justification beliefs to reduce their cognitive dissonance about smoking tobacco and the negative consequences of smoking tobacco.

# Continuing smokers (Smoking and no attempt to quit since the previous round of study.)
# Successful quitters (Quit during the study and did not use tobacco from the time of the previous round of study.)
#Failed quitters (Quit during the study, but relapsed to smoking at the time of the study.)

To reduce cognitive dissonance, the participant smokers adjusted their beliefs to correspond with their actions:

# Functional beliefs ("Smoking calms me down when I am stressed or upset."; "Smoking helps me concentrate better."; "Smoking is an important part of my life."; and "Smoking makes it easier for me to socialize.")
# Risk-minimizing beliefs ("The medical evidence that smoking is harmful is exaggerated."; "One has to die of something, so why not enjoy yourself and smoke?"; and "Smoking is no more risky than many other things people do.")&lt;ref&gt;Fotuhi, Omid, et al.  Tobacco control (2012): tobaccocontrol-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradigms==
There are four theoretic paradigms of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people suffer when exposed to contradictory information that is inconsistent with their prior [[belief]]s, [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, or [[Value (ethics)|values]]; (i) Belief Disconfirmation, (ii) Induced Compliance, (iii) Free Choice, and (iv) Effort Justification; which respectively explain: what happens after a person acts inconsistently, relative to his or her prior intellectual perspectives; what happens after a person makes decisions; and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested in a given perspective shall—when confronted with disconfirming evidence—expend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective.

===Belief disconfirmation===
The disconfirmation (contradiction) of a belief, ideal, or system of values causes cognitive dissonance that can be resolved by changing the belief under contradiction; yet, instead of effecting change, the resultant mental stress restores psychological consonance to the person, by misperception, rejection, or refutation of the contradiction; seeking moral support from people who share the contradicted beliefs; or acting to persuade other people that the contradiction is unreal.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, Eddie, "A Cognitive Dissonance Theory Perspective on Persuasion", in ''The Persuasion Handbook: Developments in Theory and Practice'', James Price Dillard, Michael Pfau, Eds. 2002. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications, p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Kracht|Kracht, C.]], &amp; [[David Woodard|Woodard, D.]], [http://www.wehrhahn-verlag.de/index.php?section=abisz&amp;subsection=details&amp;id=577 ''Five Years, Vol. 1''] ([[Hannover]]: [[:de:Wehrhahn Verlag|Wehrhahn Verlag]], 2011), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early hypothesis of belief disconfirmation presented in ''[[When Prophecy Fails]]'' (1956) reported that faith deepened among the members of an apocalyptic religious cult, despite the failed prophecy of an alien spacecraft soon to land on Earth, to rescue them from earthly corruption. At the determined place and time, the cult assembled; they believed that only they would survive planetary destruction; yet the spaceship did not arrive to Earth. The disconfirmed prophecy caused them acute cognitive-dissonance: Had they been victims of a hoax? Had they vainly donated away their material possessions? To resolve the dissonance, between apocalyptic, end-of-the-world religious beliefs and earthly, [[Reality|material reality]], most of the cult restored their psychological consonance by choosing to hold a less mentally-stressful idea to explain the missed landing. That the aliens had given planet Earth a second chance at existence, which, in turn, empowered them to re-direct their religious cult to environmentalism; social advocacy to end human damage to planet Earth. Moreover, upon overcoming the disconfirmed belief by changing to global environmentalism, the cult increased in numbers, by successful [[proselytism]].&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L., Riecken, H.W., Schachter, S. ''When Prophecy Fails'' (1956). Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. p. 000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ''The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference'' (2008) reported the belief disconfirmation occurred to the ''[[Chabad]]'' Orthodox Jewish congregation who believed that their [[Rebbe]] (Menachem Mendel Schneerson) was the Messiah. Yet, when he died of a stroke in 1994, instead of accepting that their Rebbe was not the Messiah, some of the congregants proved indifferent to that contradictory fact and continued claiming that [[Chabad messianism#The belief that Schneerson would still be the Messiah after his death|Schneerson was the Messiah]], and that he would soon return from the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, David (2008). ''The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference''. Portland: Litman Library of Jewish Civilization.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Induced compliance===
{{see also|Forced compliance theory}}
In the ''Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance'' (1959), the investigators Festinger and [[Merrill Carlsmith]] asked students to spend an hour doing tedious tasks; e.g. turning pegs a quarter-turn, at fixed intervals. The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor) and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. Subjects of one group were paid twenty dollars ($20); those in a second group were paid one dollar ($1); and those in the control group were not asked to speak with the imposter-subject.

[[File:Clark Stanley's Snake Oil Liniment.png|thumb|After performing dissonant behavior ([[lie|lying]]) a person might find external, consonant elements. Therefore, a [[snake oil]] salesman might find a psychological self-justification (great profit) for promoting medical falsehoods, but, otherwise, might need to change his beliefs about the falsehoods.]]

At the conclusion of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did the subjects in the first group (paid $20) and than did the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: "I told someone that the task was interesting" and "I actually found it boring." Moreover, the subjects paid one dollar were induced to comply, compelled to internalize the "interesting task" mental attitude because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the "interesting task" mental attitude and, thus, experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Festinger | first1 = L. | last2 = Carlsmith | first2 = J.M. | year = 1959 | title = Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance | url = http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/index.htm | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 203–210 | doi=10.1037/h0041593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Forbidden Behaviour paradigm
In the ''Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior'' (1963), a variant of the induced-compliance paradigm, by [[Elliot Aronson]] and Carlsmith, examined [[self-justification]] in children.&lt;ref name="aronson1963"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aronson | first1 = E. | last2 = Carlsmith | first2 = J.M. | year = 1963 | title = Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 6| pages = 584–588 | doi = 10.1037/h0039901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the experiment, children were left in a room with a variety of toys, including a greatly desirable steam shovel, the forbidden toy. Upon leaving the room, the experimenter told one-half of the group of children that there would be severe punishment if they played with the steam-shovel toy; and told the second half of the group that there would be a mild punishment for playing with the forbidden toy. All of the children refrained from playing with the forbidden toy (the steam shovel).&lt;ref name= "aronson1963"/&gt;

Later, when the children were told that they could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the steam shovel (the forbidden toy), despite removal of the threat of mild punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment, in itself, was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort.&lt;ref name=aronson1963 /&gt;

In ''The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance'' (2012), a variant of the forbidden-toy paradigm, indicated that listening to music reduces the development of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name=MasatakaPerlovsky_MusicReducesCognitiveDissonance&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep00694|title=The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance|journal=[[Scientific Reports]]|volume=2|year=2012|last1=Masataka|first1=Nobuo|last2=Perlovsky|first2=Leonid |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00694.pdf}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without music in the background, the control group of four-year-old children were told to avoid playing with a forbidden toy. After playing alone, the control-group children later devalued the importance of the forbidden toy; however, in the variable group, classical music played in the background, while the children played alone. In that group, the children did not later devalue the forbidden toy. The researchers, Nobuo Masataka and Leonid Perlovsky, concluded that music might inhibit cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="MasatakaPerlovsky_MusicReducesCognitiveDissonance"/&gt;

Moreover, music is a stimulus that can diminish post-decisional dissonance; in an earlier experiment, ''Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance'' (2010), the researchers indicated that the actions of hand-washing might inhibit the cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee |first1=Spike W. S. |last2=Schwarz |first2=Norbert |title=Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance|journal=Science|date=May 2010|volume=328|doi=10.1126/science.1186799 |pmid=20448177 |issue=5979 |pages=709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free choice===
In the study ''Post-decision Changes in Desirability of Alternatives'' (1956) 225 female students rated a series of domestic appliances and then were asked to choose one of two appliances as a gift. The results of a second round of ratings indicated that the women students increased their ratings of the domestic appliance they had selected as a gift and decreased their ratings of the appliances they rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brehm | first1 = J. | year = 1956 | title = Post-decision Changes in Desirability of Alternatives | doi = 10.1037/h0041006 | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 384–389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of cognitive dissonance occurs to a person faced with making a difficult decision, wherein there always exist aspects of the rejected-object not chosen, which appeal to the person making the choice. The action of deciding provokes the psychological dissonance consequent to choosing X instead of Y, despite little difference between X and Y; thus, the decision "I chose X" is dissonant with the cognition that "There are some aspects of Y that I like." Moreover, the study ''Choice-induced Preferences in the Absence of Choice: Evidence from a Blind Two-choice Paradigm with Young Children and Capuchin Monkeys'' (2010) reports similar results in the occurrence of cognitive dissonance in human beings and in animals.&lt;ref name="Egan et al."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Egan | first1 = L.C. | last2 = Bloom | first2 = P. | last3 = Santos | first3 = L.R. | year = 2010 | title = Choice-induced Preferences in the Absence of Choice: Evidence from a Blind Two-choice Paradigm with Young Children and Capuchin Monkeys | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2009.08.014 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 204–207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peer Effects in Pro-Social Behavior: Social Norms or Social Preferences?'' (2013) indicated that, in addition to internal deliberation, the structuring of decisions among people can influence how a person acts individually. That social preferences and social norms are related, and function in line with wage-giving among three persons. The actions of the first person influenced{{clarify|date=October 2015}} the wage-giving actions of the second person. That inequity aversion is the paramount concern of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/jeea.12015|pmid=28553193|title=Peer Effects in Pro-Social Behavior: Social Norms or Social Preferences?|journal=Journal of the European Economic Association|volume=11|issue=3|pages=548–573|year=2013|last1=Gächter|first1=Simon|last2=Nosenzo|first2=Daniele|last3=Sefton|first3=Martin|ssrn=2010940}}

===Effort justification===
{{further|Effort justification}}
Cognitive dissonance occurs to a person when he or she voluntarily engages in (physically or ethically) unpleasant activities in effort to achieve a desired goal. The mental stress caused by the dissonance can be reduced by the person's exaggerating the desirability of the goal. In ''The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group'' (1956), to qualify for admission to a discussion group, two groups of people underwent an embarrassing initiation, of varied psychologic severity. The first group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words considered obscene; the second group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words not considered obscene.

Both groups then were given headphones to unknowingly listen to a recorded discussion about animal sexual behaviour, which the researchers designed to be dull and banal. As the subjects of the experiment, the groups of people were told that the animal-sexuality discussion actually was occurring in the next room. The subjects whose strong initiation required reading aloud obscene words evaluated the people of their group as more-interesting persons than the people of the group who underwent the mild initiation to the discussion group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aronson | first1 = E. | last2 = Mills | first2 = J. | year = 1956 | title = The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group | url = http://faculty.uncfsu.edu/tvancantfort/Syllabi/Gresearch/Readings/A_Aronson.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 177–181 | doi=10.1037/h0047195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in ''Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing'' (2006), the results indicated that a person washing his or her hands is an action that helps resolve post-decisional cognitive dissonance because the mental stress usually was caused by the person's ethical–moral self-disgust, which is an emotion related to the physical disgust caused by a dirty environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = S.W.S. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = N. | year = 2010 | title = Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/328/5979/709 | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5979| page = 709 | doi=10.1126/science.1186799 | pmid=20448177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhong | first1 = C.B. | last2 = Liljenquist | first2 = K. | year = 2006 | title = Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing | doi = 10.1126/science.1130726 | journal = Science | volume = 313 | issue = 5792| pages = 1451–1452 | pmid=16960010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Likewise, the study ''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2011) indicated that participants rated 80 names and 80 paintings based on how much they liked the names and paintings. To give meaning to the decisions, the participants were asked to select names that they might give to their children. For rating the paintings, the participants were asked to base their ratings on whether or not they would display such art at home.

The results indicated that when the decision is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based on his or her attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The results indicated a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period, and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.&lt;ref&gt;Jarcho, J. M., Berkman, E. T., &amp; Lieberman, M. D.

=== Unpleasant medical screenings ===
In the study ''Cognitive Dissonance and Attitudes Toward Unpleasant Medical Screenings '' (2016), the researchers Michael R. Ent and Mary A Gerend informed the study participants about a discomforting test for a specific (fictitious) virus called the "human respiratory virus-27". The study used a fake virus to prevent participants from having thoughts, opinions, and feeling about the virus that would interfere with the experiment. The study participants were in two groups; one group was told that they were actual candidates for the virus-27 test, and the second group were told they were not candidates for the test. The researchers reported, "We predicted that [study] participants who thought that they were candidates for the unpleasant test would experience dissonance associated with knowing that the test was both unpleasant and in their best interest—this dissonance was predicted to result in unfavorable attitudes toward the test."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ent|first=Michael R.|last2=Gerend|first2=Mary A.|date=September 2016|title=Cognitive Dissonance and Attitudes Toward Unpleasant Medical Screenings|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=21|issue=9|pages=2075–2084|doi=10.1177/1359105315570986|issn=1461-7277|pmid=27535832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications==
=== Education ===
The management of cognitive dissonance readily influences the [[motivation]] of a student to pursue education.&lt;ref name="Aronson1995"&gt;Aronson, E. (1995).'' The Social Animal'' (1995), New York: W.H. Freeman and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The study ''Turning Play into Work: Effects of Adult Surveillance and Extrinsic Rewards on Children’s Intrinsic Motivation'' (1975) indicated that the application of the [[effort justification]] paradigm increased student enthusiasm for education with the offer of an external reward for studying; students in pre-school who completed puzzles based upon an adult promise of reward were later less interested in the puzzles than were students who completed the puzzle-tasks without the promise of a reward.&lt;ref name="LepperandGreene1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lepper | first1 = M.

The incorporation of cognitive dissonance into models of basic learning-processes to foster the students’ [[self-awareness]] of psychological conflicts among their personal beliefs, [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, and [[values]] and the reality of contradictory facts and information, requires the students to defend their personal beliefs. Afterwards, the  students are trained to objectively perceive new facts and information to resolve the [[psychological stress]] of the conflict between reality and the student's value system.&lt;ref name="GuzzettiSnyderGlassandGamas1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guzzetti | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Snyder | first2 = T.E. | last3 = Glass | first3 = G.V. | last4 = Gamas | first4 = W.S. | year = 1993 | title = Promoting Conceptual Change in Science: A Comparative Meta-analysis of Instructional Interventions from Reading Education and Science Education | journal = Reading Research Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 116–159 | jstor=747886 | doi=10.2307/747886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[educational software]] that applies the derived principles facilitates the students’ ability to successfully handle the questions posed in a complex subject.&lt;ref name="GraesserBaggettandWilliams1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graesser | first1 = A.

=== Psychotherapy ===
The general effectiveness of [[psychotherapy]] and [[psychological intervention]] is partly explained by the theory of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Cooper2007"&gt;Cooper, J. (2007). Cognitive Dissonance: 50 Years of a Classic Theory. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In that vein, [[social psychology]] proposed that the mental health of the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific [[therapy]] and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="CooperAxsom1982"&gt;Cooper, J., &amp; Axsom, D. (1982). Integration of Clinical and Social Psychology. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; That effective phenomenon was indicated in the results of the study ''Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment of Overweight Children'' (1983), wherein the children's belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight.&lt;ref name="MendoncaBrehm1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mendonca | first1 = P.

In the study ''Reducing Fears and Increasing Attentiveness: The Role of Dissonance Reduction '' (1980), people afflicted with [[ophidiophobia]] (fear of snakes) who invested much effort in activities of little therapeutic value for them (experimentally represented as legitimate and relevant) showed improved alleviation of the symptoms of their [[phobia]].&lt;ref name="Cooper1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = J. | year = 1980 | title = Reducing Fears and Increasing Attentiveness: The Role of Dissonance Reduction | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(80)90064-5 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 452–460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the results of ''Cognitive Dissonance and Psychotherapy: The Role of Effort Justification in Inducing Weight Loss'' (1985) indicated that the patient felt better in justifying his or her efforts and therapeutic choices towards effectively losing weight. That the therapy of effort expenditure can predict long-term change in the patient's perceptions.&lt;ref name="AxsomCooper1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axsom | first1 = D. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Cognitive Dissonance and Psychotherapy: The Role of Effort Justification in Inducing Weight Loss | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(85)90012-5 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 149–160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive dissonance can be applied in social areas such as racism and racial hatred.  Acharya of Stanford, Blackwell and Sen of Harvard state CD increases when an individual commits an act of violence toward someone from a different ethnic or racial group and decreases when the individual does not commit any such act of violence. Research from Acharya, Blackwell and Sen shows that individuals committing violence against members of another group will develop hostile attitudes towards their victims as a way of minimizing CD. Importantly, the hostile attitudes may persist even after the violence itself declines (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015). The application provides a social psychological basis for the constructivist viewpoint that ethnic and racial divisions can be socially or individually constructed, possibly from acts of violence (Fearon and Laitin, 2000). Their framework speaks to this possibility by showing how violent actions by individuals can affect individual attitudes, either ethnic or racial animosity (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015).

=== Consumer behavior&lt;!-- This section is not an application of research, and is questionable regarding ethics --&gt; ===
Three  main conditions exist for provoking cognitive dissonance when buying: (i) The decision to purchase must be important, such as the sum of money to spend; (ii) The psychological cost; and (iii)  The purchase is personally relevant to the consumer. The consumer is free to select from the alternatives, and the decision to buy is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gbadamosi|first=Ayantunji|title=Cognitive Dissonance: The Implicit Explication in Low-income Consumers' Shopping Behaviour for "Low-involvement" Grocery Products|journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management|date=January 2009|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1077–1095|doi= 10.1108/09590550911005038|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers' Encounters with Unexpected Prices '' (2003), indicated that when consumers experience an unexpected price encounter, they adopt three methods to reduce cognitive dissonance: (i) Employ a strategy of continual information; (ii) Employ a change in attitude; and (iii)  Engage in [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]]. Consumers employ the strategy of continual information by engaging in bias and searching for information that supports prior beliefs. Consumers might search for information about other retailers and substitute products consistent with their beliefs. Alternatively, consumers might change attitude, such as re-evaluating price in relation to external reference-prices or associating high prices and low prices with quality. Minimisation reduces the importance of the elements of the dissonance; consumers tend to minimise the importance of money, and thus of shopping around, saving, and finding a better deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mullikin|first=Lindsey J|title=Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers' Encounters with Unexpected Prices|journal=Journal of Products &amp; Brand Management|year=2003|volume=12|issue=3|pages=140–153|doi=10.1108/10610420310476906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
Cognitive dissonance theory might suggest that since votes are an expression of preference or beliefs, even the act of voting might cause someone to defend the actions of the candidate for whom they voted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cognitive-dissonance-politics-prabhakar-mundkur/|title=Is there Cognitive Dissonance in Politics?|date=2016-07-11|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the decision was close then the effects of cognitive dissonance should be greater.

This effect was studied over the 6 presidential elections of the United States between 1972 and 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beasley|first=Ryan K.|last2=Joslyn|first2=Mark R.|date=2001-09-01|title=Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Attitude Change in Six Presidential Elections|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0162-895X.00252/abstract|journal=Political Psychology|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–540|doi=10.1111/0162-895X.00252|issn=1467-9221}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was found that the opinion differential between the candidates changed more before and after the election than the opinion differential of non-voters. In addition, elections where the voter had a favorable attitude toward both candidates, making the choice more difficult, had the opinion differential of the candidates change more dramatically than those who only had a favorable opinion of one candidate. What wasn't studied were the cognitive dissonance effects in cases where the person had unfavorable attitudes toward both candidates. Since the U.S. 2016 election held historically high unfavorable ratings for both candidates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/22/politics/2016-election-poll-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/index.html|title=Poll: Trump, Clinton score historic unfavorable ratings|last=CNN|first=David Wright,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; it might be a good case study to examine the cognitive dissonance effects in these instances.

=== Self-perception theory===
In ''The Gestalt Theory of Motivation'' (1960), the social psychologist [[Daryl Bem]] proposed the [[self-perception theory]] whereby people do not think much about their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person is in the same position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.&lt;ref name="Heider, F. 1960"&gt;Heider, F. (1960). The Gestalt Theory of Motivation. Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, 8, pp. 145–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the experimental subjects of the Festinger and Carlsmith study (''Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance'', 1959) inferred their mental attitudes from their own behaviour. When the subject-participants were asked: "Did you find the task interesting?", the participants decided that they must have found the task interesting, because that is what they told the questioner. Their replies suggested that the participants who were paid twenty dollars had an external incentive to adopt that positive attitude, and likely perceived the twenty dollars as the reason for saying the task was interesting, rather than saying the task actually was interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bem | first1 = D.J. | year = 1965 | title = An Experimental Analysis of Self-persuasion|doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(65)90026-0 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 199–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bem | first1 = D.J. | year = 1967 | title = Self-perception: An Alternative Interpretation of Cognitive Dissonance Phenomena | url = http://dbem.ws/SP%20Theory%20Cognitive%20Dissonance.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 183–200 | doi=10.1037/h0024835 | pmid=5342882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of self-perception (Bem) and the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger) make identical predictions, but only the theory of cognitive dissonance predicts the presence of unpleasant [[arousal]], of psychological distress, which were verified in laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zanna | first1 = M. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = J. | year = 1974 | title = Dissonance and the Pill: An Attribution Approach to Studying the Arousal Properties of Dissonance | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1974-32359-001 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 703–709 | doi=10.1037/h0036651| pmid = 4833431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kiesler | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Pallak | first2 = M.S. | year = 1976 | title = Arousal Properties of Dissonance Manipulations | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1977-21057-001 | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 83 | issue = 6| pages = 1014–1025 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.83.6.1014| pmid = 996211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective'' (1969), [[Elliot Aronson]] linked cognitive dissonance to the [[self-concept]]: That mental stress arises when the conflicts among cognitions threatens the person's positive self-image. This reinterpretation of the original Festinger and Carlsmith study, using the induced-compliance paradigm, proposed that the dissonance was between the cognitions "I am an honest person." and "I lied about finding the task interesting."&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 1969 pp. 1–34"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60075-1|chapter=The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|volume=4|pages=1–34|year=1969|last1=Aronson|first1=Elliot|isbn=9780120152049|publisher=Academic Press|editor-first1=Leonard |editor-last1=Berkowitz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''Cognitive Dissonance: Private Ratiocination or Public Spectacle?'' (1971) reported that maintaining cognitive consistency, rather than protecting a private self-concept, is how a person protects his or her public [[self-image]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tedeschi | first1 = J.T. | last2 = Schlenker | first2 = B.R. | last3 = Bonoma | first3 = T.V. | year = 1971 | title = Cognitive Dissonance: Private Ratiocination or Public Spectacle? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 26 | issue = 8| pages = 685–695 | doi = 10.1037/h0032110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the results reported in the study ''I’m No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors'' (2010) contradict such an explanation, by showing the occurrence of revaluation of material items, after the person chose and decided, even after having forgotten the choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coppin | first1 = G. | last2 = Delplanque | first2 = S. | last3 = Cayeux | first3 = I. | last4 = Porcherot | first4 = C. | last5 = Sander | first5 = D. | year = 2010 | title = I'm No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 489–493 | pmid = 20424088 | doi=10.1177/0956797610364115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Balance theory===
{{main|Balance theory}}
[[Fritz Heider]] proposed a motivational theory of attitude change that functions on the idea that humans are driven to establish and maintain psychological balance.  This drive is known as the consistency motive—the urge to maintain one's values and beliefs over time.
According to balance theory there are three things interacting: (1) you (P), (2) another person (O), and (3) an element (X).  These are each positioned at one point of a triangle and share two relations:&lt;ref name="Heider, F. 1960"/&gt;
# ''Unit relations'' – things and people that belong together based on similarity, proximity, fate, etc.
# ''Sentiment relations'' – evaluations of people and things (liking, disliking)

As people, human beings seek a balanced state of relations among three positions; 3 positives or 2 negatives, 1 positive:
 P = you
 O = John
 X = John's dog
::"I don't like John"
::"John has a dog"
::"I don't like the dog either"

People also avoid unbalanced states of relations; 3 negatives or 2 positives, 1 negative)
 P = you
 O = your child
 X = picture your child drew
::"I love my child"
::"She drew me this picture"
::"I love this picture"

===Cost–benefit analysis===
In the study ''On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works'' (1969), [[Jules Dupuit]] reported that behaviors and cognitions can be understood from an economic perspective, wherein people engage in the systematic processing of comparing the costs and benefits of a decision. The psychological process of cost-benefit comparisons helps the person to assess and justify the feasibility (spending money) of an economic decision, and is the basis for determining if the benefit outweighs the cost, and to what extent. Moreover, although the method of cost-benefit analysis functions in economic circumstances, men and women remain psychologically inefficient at comparing the costs against the benefits of their economic decision.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuit, J. (1969). “On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works”, ''Readings in Welfare''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-discrepancy theory===

[[E. Tory Higgins]] proposed that people have three selves, to which they compare themselves:

# ''Actual self'' – representation of the attributes the person believes him- or herself to possess (basic self-concept)
# ''Ideal self'' – ideal attributes the person would like to possess (hopes, aspiration, motivations to change)
# ''Ought self'' – ideal attributes the person believes he or she should possess (duties, obligations, responsibilities)

When these self-guides are contradictory psychological distress (cognitive dissonance) results. People are motivated to reduce [[self-discrepancy theory|self-discrepancy]] (the gap between two self-guides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3615707|year=1987|author1=Higgins|first1=E. T.|title=Self-discrepancy: A Theory Relating Self and Affect|journal=Psychological Review|volume=94|issue=3|pages=319–340|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.94.3.319|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/higgins/papers/HIGGINS%3DPSYCH%20REVIEW%201987.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074101/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/higgins/papers/HIGGINS%3DPSYCH%20REVIEW%201987.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Averse consequences vs. inconsistency===
During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio argued that dissonance was caused by aversive consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60121-5|chapter=A New Look at Dissonance Theory|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|volume=17|pages=229–266|year=1984|last1=Cooper|first1=Joel|last2=Fazio|first2=Russell H.|isbn=9780120152179|editor-first=Leonard|editor-last= Berkowitz|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when they feel they have not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E. | last2 = Brehm | first2 = J.W. | last3 = Greenberg | first3 = J. | last4 = Simon | first4 = L. | last5 = Nelson | first5 = D.E. | year = 1996 | title = Evidence that the production of aversive consequences is not necessary to create cognitive dissonance | url = http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_etal96.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 5–16 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the free-choice paradigm===
In the study ''How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm'' (2010) the researchers criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate for the study of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = M.K. | last2 = Risen | first2 = J.L. | year = 2010 | title = How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm | doi = 10.1037/a0020217 | pmid = 20658837 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 573–594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That the designing of research-models relies upon the assumption that, if the experimental subject rates options differently in the second survey, then the attitudes of the subject towards the options have changed. That there are other reasons why an experimental subject might achieve different rankings in the second survey; perhaps the subjects were indifferent between choices.

Although the results of some follow-up studies (e.g. ''Do Choices Affect Preferences? Some Doubts and New Evidence'', 2013) presented evidence of the unreliability of the rank-choice-rank method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.00983.x|title=Do Choices Affect Preferences?

===Action–motivation model===
The action–motivation model proposes that inconsistencies in a person's cognition cause mental stress, because psychologic inconsistency interferes with the person's functioning in the [[Reality|real world]]. Among the ways for coping, the person can choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent with his or her current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be consonant with a current behaviour; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to that course of behaviour.

The occurrence of cognitive dissonance produces a state of [[affect (psychology)|negative affect]], which motivates the person to reconsider the causative behaviour, in order to resolve the psychologic inconsistency that caused the mental stress.&lt;ref&gt;(Beckmann and Kuhl, 1984, Harmon-Jones, 1999, Harmon-Jones, 2000a, Jones and Gerard, 1967, McGregor et al., 1999 and Newby-Clark ''et al.'', 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; As the afflicted person works towards a behavioural commitment, the motivational process then is activated in the left [[frontal cortex]] of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beckmann | first1 = J | last2 = Kuhl | first2 = J | year = 1984 | title = Altering Information to Gain Action Control: Functional Aspects of Human Information Processing in Decision Making | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 224–237 | doi=10.1016/0092-6566(84)90031-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmon-Jones, E. 1999. pp. 71"&gt;Harmon-Jones, E., 1999. “Toward an Understanding of the Motivation Underlying Dissonance Processes: Is Feeling Personally Responsible for the Production of Aversive Consequences Necessary to Cause Dissonance Effects?” in ''Cognitive Dissonance: Perspectives on a Pivotal Theory in Social Psychology''.

P., 1999. “Epistemic Discomfort is Moderated by Simultaneous Accessibility of Inconsistent Elements”, in ''Cognitive Dissonance: Progress on a Pivotal Theory in Social Psychology'', Washington, DC: American Psychological Association, pp. 325–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictive dissonance model===
The predictive dissonance model proposes that cognitive dissonance is fundamentally related to the [[predictive coding]] (or predictive processing) model of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaaronen | first1 = R.O. | year = 2018 | title = A Theory of Predictive Dissonance: Predictive Processing Presents a New Take on Cognitive Dissonance | url = https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02218/full | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 9| issue = | pages = 1–15 | doi=10.1177/01461672002612004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A predictive processing account of the mind proposes that perception actively involves the use of a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] hierarchy of acquired prior knowledge, which primarily serves the role of predicting incoming [[proprioception|proprioceptive]], [[interoception|interoceptive]] and [[exteroception|exteroceptive]] sensory inputs. Therefore, the brain is an inference machine which attempts to actively predict and explain its sensations. Crucial to this inference is the minimization of [[predictive coding|prediction error]]. The predictive dissonance account proposes that the motivation for cognitive dissonance reduction is related to an organism's active drive for reducing prediction error. Moreover, it proposes that human (and perhaps other animal) brains have evolved to selectively ignore contradictory information (as proposed by dissonance theory) to prevent the [[overfitting]] of their predictive cognitive models to local and thus non-generalizable conditions. The predictive dissonance account is highly compatible with the action-motivation model since, in practice, prediction error can arise from unsuccessful behavior.

== Neuroscience findings ==
=== Visualisation ===
The study ''Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance'' (2009) identified the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm. When in the fMRI scanner, some of the study participants argued that the uncomfortable, mechanical environment of the MRI machine nevertheless was a pleasant experience for them; some participants, from an experimental group, said they enjoyed the mechanical environment of the fMRI scanner more than did the control-group participants (paid actors) who argued about the uncomfortable experimental environment.&lt;ref name="psych.ucsb.edu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Veen | first1 = V. | last2 = Krug | first2 = M.K. | last3 = Schooler | first3 = J.W. | last4 = Carter | first4 = C.S. | year = 2009 | title = Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26817210_Neural_Activity_Predicts_Attitude_Change_in_Cognitive_Dissonance/file/3deec51b8bf291652a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 11| pages = 1469–1474 | doi=10.1038/nn.2413| pmid = 19759538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the neural scan experiment support the original theory of Cognitive Dissonance proposed by Festinger in 1957; and also support the psychological conflict theory, whereby the anterior cingulate functions, in counter-attitudinal response, to activate the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and the anterior [[insular cortex]]; the degree of activation of said regions of the brain is predicted by the degree of change in the psychological attitude of the person.&lt;ref name="psych.ucsb.edu"/&gt;
[[File:MRI anterior cingulate.png|thumb|right|400px|The biomechanics of cognitive dissonance: MRI evidence indicates that the greater the psychological conflict signalled by the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], the greater the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance experienced by the person.]]

As an application of the free-choice paradigm, the study ''How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome'' (2009) indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the [[striatum]] changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; neural activity increased if the object was chosen, neural activity decreased if the object was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharot | first1 = T. | last2 = De Martino | first2 = B. | last3 = Dolan | first3 = R.J. | year = 2009 | title = How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome | url = http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~tsharot/Sharot_JofN_2009.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 3760–3765 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.4972-08.2009 | pmid = 19321772 | pmc = 2675705 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110617053852/http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~tsharot/Sharot_JofN_2009.pdf | archivedate = 2011-06-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, studies such as ''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2010)&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarcho|first1=Johanna M.|last2=Berkman|first2=Elliot T.|last3=Lieberman|first3=Matthew D.|title=The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making|journal=Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience|year=2010|doi=10.1093/scan/nsq054|pmid=20621961|volume=6|issue=4|pages=460–467|pmc=3150852}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification'' (2011) confirm the neural bases of the psychology of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Izuma et al."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qin | first1 = J. | last2 = Kimel | first2 = S. | last3 = Kitayama | first3 = S. | last4 = Wang | first4 = X. | last5 = Yang | first5 = X. | last6 = Han | first6 = S. | year = 2011 | title = How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.11.076 | pmid = 21130888 | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 240–246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2010) applied the free-choice paradigm to fMRI examination of the brain's decision-making process whilst the study participant actively tried to reduce cognitive dissonance. The results indicated that the active reduction of psychological dissonance increased neural activity in the right-[[inferior frontal gyrus]], in the medial fronto-parietal region, and in the [[ventral striatum]], and that neural activity decreased in the [[anterior insula]].&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization /&gt; That the neural activities of [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] occur in seconds, without conscious deliberation on the part of the person; and that the brain engages in emotional responses whilst effecting decisions.&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization /&gt;

=== Emotional correlations ===
The results reported in ''Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity'' (2004) indicate that the occurrence of cognitive dissonance is associated with neural activity in the [[Frontal cortex|left frontal cortex]], a brain structure also associated with the emotion of [[anger]]; moreover, functionally, anger motivates neural activity in the left frontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, 1999 and 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying a directional model of [[Motivation|Approach motivation]], the study ''Anger and the Behavioural Approach System'' (2003) indicated that the relation between cognitive dissonance and anger is supported by neural activity in the left frontal cortex that occurs when a person takes control of the social situation causing the cognitive dissonance. Conversely, if the person cannot control or cannot change the psychologically stressful situation, he or she is without a motivation to change the circumstance, then there arise other, negative emotions to manage the cognitive dissonance, such as socially inappropriate behavior.&lt;ref name="Harmon-Jones, E. 1999. pp. 71"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E | year = 2003 | title = Anger and the Behavioural Approach System | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 995–1005 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(02)00313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E | year = 2004 | title = Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity | url = | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 67| issue = 1–2| pages = 51–76 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.03.003 | pmid = 15130525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anterior cingulate cortex activity increases when errors occur and are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self-concept as a form of higher-level thinking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amodio | first1 = D.M | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E | last3 = Devine | first3 = P.G | last4 = Curtin | first4 = J.J | last5 = Hartley | first5 = S | year = 2004 | title = A Covert Neural signals for the control of unintentional race bias | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 88–93 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.01502003.x| pmid = 14738514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to write a paper depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required student to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The point of this condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it was their choice and that it was completely voluntary. EEG was used to analyze students before writing the essay as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results have shown that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the anterior cingulate cortex, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach motivational system to reduce anger.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beauvois, J. L., Joule, R. V., 1996. A radical dissonance theory. London: Taylor and Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The psychology of mental stress ===
The results reported in ''The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys'' (2007) indicated that there might be [[Evolution|evolutionary force]] behind the reduction of cognitive dissonance in the actions of pre-school-age children and [[Capuchin monkey]]s when offered a choice between two like options, decals and candies. The groups then were offered a new choice, between the choice-object not chosen and a novel choice-object that was as attractive as the first object. The resulting choices of the human and simian subjects concorded with the theory of cognitive dissonance when the children and the monkeys each chose the novel choice-object instead of the choice-object not chosen in the first selection, despite every object having the same value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Egan | first1 = L.C. | last2 = Santos | first2 = L.R. | last3 = Bloom | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys | url = http://courses.washington.edu/evpsych/Egan%20Santos%20Bloom%20-%20origins%20cog%20diss%20-%20Psy%20Sci%202007.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 11| pages = 978–983 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02012.x| pmid = 17958712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis of ''An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes'' (2015) proposed that psychological dissonance occurs consequent to the stimulation of thoughts that interfere with a goal-driven behavior. Researchers mapped the neural activity of the participant when performing tasks that provoked [[psychological stress]] when engaged in contradictory behaviors. A participant read aloud the printed name of a color. To test for the occurrence of cognitive dissonance, the name of the color was printed in a color different than the word read aloud by the participant. As a result, the participants experienced increased neural activity in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] when the experimental exercises provoked psychological dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harmon-Jones|first=E|last2=Harmon-Jones|first2=C|last3=Levy|first3=N|date=2015|title=An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes|doi=10.1177/0963721414566449|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=24|issue=3|pages=184–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude'' (2014) identified neural correlations to specific social emotions (e.g. envy and embarrassment) as a measure of cognitive dissonance. The neural activity for the emotion of [[Envy]] (the feeling of displeasure at the good fortune of another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person's [[self-concept]] was threatened or when the person suffered embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class [[snobbery]]. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and ''Schadenfreude'' (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the [[insular lobe]], and with increased activity in the [[Striatum|striate nucleus]]; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of [[empathy]] (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jankowski|first=K|last2=Takahashi|first2=H|date=2014|title=Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude|journal=Psychiatry &amp; Clinical Neurosciences|volume=68|issue=5|pages=319–336|doi=10.1111/pcn.12182|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260947954_Cognitive_neuroscience_of_social_emotions_and_implications_for_psychopathology_Examining_embarrassment_guilt_envy_and_schadenfreude}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modeling in neural networks ==
[[Artificial neural network]] models of cognition provide methods for integrating the results of empirical research and of cognitive dissonance and attitudes into a single model that explains the formation of psychological attitudes and the mechanisms to change such attitudes.&lt;ref name="read1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Read | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Vanman | first2 = E.J. | last3 = Miller | first3 = L.C. | year = 1997 | title = Connectionism, Parallel Constraint Satisfaction Processes, and Gestalt Principles: (Re)Introducing Cognitive Dynamics to Social Psychology | doi = 10.1207/s15327957pspr0101_3 | pmid = 15647127 | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 26–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the artificial neural-network models that predict how cognitive dissonance might influence a person's attitudes and behavior, are:

A '''concordance''' is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a book or body of work, listing every instance of each word with its immediate [[context (language use)#Verbal context|context]]. Only works of special importance have had concordances prepared for them, such as the [[Vedas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Maurice | last = Bloomfield| authorlink = Maurice Bloomfield | title = A Vedic Concordance| year  = 1990| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ| isbn = 81-208-0654-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bible]], [[Qur'an]] or the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[James Joyce]] or classical Latin and Greek authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Roy | last = Wisbey | authorlink = Roy Wisbey | title = Concordance Making by Electronic Computer: Some Experiences with the Wiener Genesis| journal = The Modern Language Review | publisher = Modern Humanities Research Association | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–172 | date = April 1962 | doi=10.2307/3720960}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the time, difficulty, and expense involved in creating a concordance in the pre-[[computer]] era. 
[[File:Mordechai nathan hebrew latin concordance.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Mordecai Nathan's Hebrew-Latin Concordance of the Bible]]

A concordance is more than an index; additional material make producing them a labor-intensive process, even when assisted by computers, such as commentary, definitions, and topical cross-indexing.

In the precomputing era, [[search engine technology|search]] technology was unavailable, and a concordance offered readers of long works such as the Bible something comparable to search results for every word that they would have been likely to search for. Today, the ability to combine the result of queries concerning multiple terms (such as searching for words near other words) has reduced interest in concordance publishing. In addition, mathematical techniques such as [[latent semantic indexing]] have been proposed as a means of automatically identifying linguistic information based on word context.

A '''bilingual concordance''' is a concordance based on [[aligned parallel text]].

A '''topical concordance''' is a list of subjects that a book covers (usually The Bible), with the immediate context of the coverage of those subjects. Unlike a traditional concordance, the indexed word does not have to appear in the verse. The best-known topical concordance is [[Nave's Topical Bible]].

The first [[Bible concordance]] was compiled for the [[Vulgate]] Bible by [[Hugh of St Cher]] (d.1262), who employed 500 monks to assist him. In 1448, Rabbi Mordecai Nathan completed a concordance to the Hebrew Bible. It took him ten years. A concordance to the Greek New Testament was published in 1599 by [[Henri Estienne (elder)|Henry Stephens]], and the Septuagint was done a couple of years later by Conrad Kircher in 1602. The first concordance to the English Bible was published in 1550 by Mr Marbeck. According to Cruden, it did not employ the verse numbers devised by [[Robert Estienne|Robert Stephens]] in 1545, but "the pretty large concordance" of Mr Cotton did. Then followed [[Cruden's Concordance]] and [[Strong's Concordance]].

==Use in linguistics==
Concordances are frequently used in [[linguistics]], when studying a text. For example:
* comparing different usages of the same word
* analysing keywords
* analysing [[word frequencies]]
* finding and analysing phrases and [[idioms]]
* finding [[translation]]s of subsentential elements, e.g. [[terminology]], in [[Bitext#Bitexts and translation memories|bitexts and translation memories]]
* creating indexes and word lists (also useful for publishing)

Concordancing techniques are widely used in national [[text corpora]] such as [[American National Corpus]], [[British National Corpus]], and [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] available on-line.  Stand-alone applications that employ concordancing techniques are known as [[Concordancer|concordancers]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexically.net/wordsmith/introduction.htm?gclid=COjFnvGKhakCFVJX4Qod-RqjjQ Introduction to WordSmith]&lt;/ref&gt; or more advanced [[corpus manager|corpus managers]]. Some of them have integrated [[Part of speech tagger|part-of-speech taggers]] and enable the user to create his/her own [[part of speech|POS]]-annotated corpora to conduct various type of searches adopted in corpus linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/linguistic-toobox-a-concordancer.html Linguistic Toolbox]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inversion==

The reconstruction of the text of some of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] involved a concordance.

Access to some of the scrolls was governed by a "secrecy rule" that allowed only the original International Team or their designates to view the original materials. After the death of [[Roland de Vaux]] in 1971, his successors repeatedly refused to even allow the publication of photographs to other scholars. This restriction was circumvented by [[Martin Abegg]] in 1991, who used a computer to "invert" a concordance of the missing documents made in the 1950s which had come into the hands of scholars outside of the International Team, to obtain an approximate reconstruction of the original text of 17 of the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Hawrysch |first= George |title= Dr. George Hawrysch's speech on concordance book launch |work= The Ukrainian Weekly, No. 31, Vol. LXX |publisher= Ukrainian National Association |date= 2002-08-04 |url= http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2002/310217.shtml |accessdate= 2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Jillette |first= Penn |title= You May Already be a "Computer Expert" |url= http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc/deadsea.html |accessdate= 2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by the release of the original text of the scrolls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29256">One of the modern [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|systems of plant taxonomy]], the '''Dahlgren system''' was published by [[monocotyledons|monocot]] specialist [[Rolf Dahlgren]] in 1975{{sfn|Dahlgren|1975}} and revised in 1977,{{sfn|Dahlgren|1977}} and  1980.{{sfn|Dahlgren|1980}} However, he is best known for his two treatises on monocotyledons in 1982 {{sfn|Dahlgren|Clifford|1982}} and revised in 1985.{{Sfn|Dahlgren|Clifford|Yeo|1985}} His wife [[Gertrud Dahlgren]] continued the work after his death.{{sfn|Dahlgren|1989}}

Dahlgren ranked the [[dicotyledons]] and monocotyledons as [[subclass (biology)|subclasses]] of the class of flowering plants ([[angiosperms]]) and further divided them into [[superorders]]. Originally (1975) he used the [[suffix]] ''-anae'', as did [[Arthur Cronquist|Cronquist]], to designate these, but in 1980 changed this to ''-florae'' in accordance with [[Robert F Thorne|Thorne]]. In the 1989 revision, published by his wife, the alternate names Magnoliidae and Liliidae were dropped in favour of Dicotyledon and Monocotyledon, and  the suffix ''-florae'' reverted to ''-anae'' (''e.g.'' [[Alismatanae]] for Alismatiflorae).

[[James L. Reveal|Reveal]] provides an extensive listing of Dahlgren's classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/pbio/pb250/dahl1.html JL Reveal:Dahlgren System of Angiosperm Classification 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; (Note the synonyms, both nomenclatural and taxonomic, for each name in the system.)

==Incidence and causes==

Researcher Vicky Williamson at Goldsmiths, University of London, found in an uncontrolled study that earworms correlated with music exposure, but could also be triggered by experiences that trigger the memory of a song ([[involuntary memory]]) such as seeing a word that reminds one of the song, hearing a few notes from the song, or feeling an emotion one associates with the song.  The list of songs collected in the study showed no particular pattern, other than popularity.&lt;ref name="theworld" /&gt;

According to research by James Kellaris, 98% of individuals experience earworms. Women and men experience the phenomenon equally often, but earworms tend to last longer for women and irritate them more.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2901/why-do-songs-get-stuck-in-your-head|work=The Straight Dope|title=Why do songs get stuck in your head?|date=October 16, 2009|first=Cecil|last=Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kellaris produced statistics suggesting that songs with lyrics may account for 73.7% of earworms, whereas instrumental music may cause only 7.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/news/kellaris.htm|title=Songs That Cause The Brain To 'Itch': UC Professor Investigating Why Certain Tunes Get Stuck In Our Heads|last1=Hoffman|first1=Carey|date=2001-04-04|publisher=University of Cincinnati|accessdate=2012-08-06|quote=Of the 1,000 respondents, the kind of music respondents said they got stuck on most recently were songs with lyrics for 73.7 percent, jingles or ads for 18.6 percent and an instrumental tune for 7.7 percent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, published data in the ''[[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Psychology]]'' directly addressed the subject, and its results support earlier claims that earworms are usually 15 to 30 seconds in length and are more common in those with an interest in music.&lt;ref name=beaman/&gt;

==Cures==
Scientists at [[Western Washington University]] found that engaging [[working memory]] in moderately difficult tasks (such as [[anagram]]s, [[Sudoku]] puzzles, or reading a novel) was an effective way of stopping earworms and of reducing their recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9950143/Get-that-tune-out-of-your-head-scientists-find-how-to-get-rid-of-earworms.html|title=Get that tune out of your head – scientists find how to get rid of earworms|last=Gray|first=Richard|date=24 March 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2298444/Got-song-stuck-head-Solving-anagram-help-rid-it.html Got a song stuck in your head? Solving an anagram can help get rid of it], Daily Mail, 24 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another publication points out that melodic music has a tendency to demonstrate repeating rhythm which may lead to endless repetition, unless a climax can be achieved to break the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Machine Models of Music|page=174|first=Stephan M.|last=Schwanauer|first2=David A.|last2=Levitt|publisher=MIT Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-262-19319-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research reported in 2015 by the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences at the [[University of Reading]] demonstrated that [[chewing gum]] could help by similarly blocking the sub-vocal rehearsal component of auditory short-term or "working" memory associated with generating and manipulating auditory and musical images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR631000.aspx "Listen up – new research shows chewing gum could remove that stuck record in your head"], University of Reading, 22 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
[[Jean Harris]], who murdered [[Herman Tarnower]], was obsessed with the song "[[Put the Blame on Mame]]", which she first heard in the film ''[[Gilda]]''. She would [[Intrusive thoughts|recall this regularly]] for over 33 years and could hold a conversation while playing it in her mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jean Harris' Obsessive Film Song Recall|first=Cora L.|last=Díaz de Chumaceiro|url=http://www.psyartjournal.com/article/show/de_chumaceiro-jean_harris_obsessive_film_song_recall|journal=PsyArt|date=October 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
&lt;!-- Please only include examples where an earworm is a significant part of the work, not merely an reference. Include a reference to a reliable source that indicates its significance. --&gt;

[[Mark Twain]]'s 1876 story "[[A Literary Nightmare]]" (also known as "Punch, Brothers, Punch") is about a [[jingle]] that one can get rid of only by transferring it to another person.

In 1943 [[Henry Kuttner]] published the short story "[[Nothing but Gingerbread Left]]" about a song engineered to damage the Nazi war effort, culminating in [[Adolf Hitler]] being unable to continue a speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://henrykuttner.bravehost.com/Kuttner,%20Henry%20-%20Nothing%20But%20Gingerbread%20Left.html|title=Nothing But Gingerbread Left|last=Kuttner|first=Henry|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314223346/http://henrykuttner.bravehost.com/Kuttner,%20Henry%20-%20Nothing%20But%20Gingerbread%20Left.html|archive-date=14 March 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=10 October 2017}} ''Full text of story''&lt;/ref&gt;

A short story, "Pie and Punch and You-Know-Whats" in [[Robert McCloskey]]'s 1951 [[Homer Price]] collection "Centerburg Tales" features a earworm from a jukebox that nearly infects the whole town.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki/Earworms|title=Zhurnaly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Alfred Bester]]'s 1953 novel ''[[The Demolished Man]]'', the protagonist uses a jingle specifically crafted to be a catchy, irritating nuisance as a tool to block mind readers from reading his mind.

In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1957 science fiction short story "[[The Ultimate Melody]]", a scientist, Gilbert Lister, develops the ultimate melody – one that so compels the brain that its listener becomes completely and forever enraptured by it. As the storyteller, Harry Purvis, explains, Lister theorized that a great melody "made its impression on the mind because it fitted in with the fundamental electrical rhythms going on in the brain." Lister attempts to abstract from the hit tunes of the day to a melody that fits in so well with the electrical rhythms that it dominates them completely. He succeeds and is found in a catatonic state from which he never awakens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://deoxy.org/alephnull/melody.htm|title=The Ultimate Melody by Arthur C. Clarke|work=The Web site of aleph|first=Michael|last=Chorost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Fritz Leiber]]'s [[Hugo Award]]-nominated short story "Rump-Titty-Titty-Tum-TAH-Tee" (1959), the title describes a rhythmic drumbeat so powerful that it rapidly spreads to all areas of human culture, until a counter-rhythm is developed that acts as an antidote.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JATrt8qhXqIC&amp;pg=PA218|title=The Wavewatcher's Companion|first=Gavin|last=Pretor-Pinney|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7475-8976-1|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]'s 1988 book ''[[Touching the Void (book)|Touching the Void]]'', he talks about not being able to get the tune "[[Brown Girl in the Ring (song)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]" by [[Boney M]] out of his head. The book tells of his survival, against the odds, after a mountaineering accident in the remote [[Siula Grande]] region of South America. Alone, badly injured, and in a semi-delirious state, he is confused as to whether he is imagining the music or really hearing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson |first=Joe|title=Touching the Void|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In episode 20 of [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants episodes#Season 7: 2009–2011|season 7]] of ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', entitled "Ear Worm" (2010), SpongeBob gets a song stuck in his head called "Musical Doodle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spongebob.nick.com/videos/clip/sponge-bob-ear-worm-clip-1.html|title=Ear Worm: Musical Doodle|publisher=Nick.com|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode refers to the earworm as a physical creature that enters one's head upon one's listening to a catchy song.

In the ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' episode titled "Head Band", a contagious group of [[virus]]es force their host to sing what they are saying to the same "boy band" tune. The only way to be cured of the Boy Band Virus is for the viruses to break up and start their own solo careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tv.com/shows/dexters-laboratory/head-band-stuffed-animal-house-used-ink-1591794/|title = Dexter's Laboratory: Head Band / Stuffed Animal House / Used Ink|date = |accessdate = 29 May 2014|website = TV.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. B. White]]'s 1933 [[Satire|satirical]] short story "The Supremacy of Uruguay" (reprinted in ''[[Timeless Stories for Today and Tomorrow]]'') relates a fictional episode in the history of Uruguay where a powerful earworm is discovered in a popular American song. The Uruguayan military builds a squadron of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|pilotless aircraft]] armed with [[phonograph]]s playing a highly amplified recording of the earworm, and conquers the entire world by reducing the citizens of all nations to mindless insanity. "[T]he peoples were hopelessly mad, ravaged by an ineradicable noise ... No one could hear anything except the noise in his own head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armandobronca.com/the-supremacy-of-uruguay_95|title=The Supremacy of Uruguay|publisher=www.armandobronca.com|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' titled "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]", Sheldon obsesses about a tune stuck in his head. He eventually figures out that it is [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|"Darlin'"]] by [[The Beach Boys]].

The [[Wise Guys (band)|Wise Guys]], a German pop band/a cappella group, created a song called Ohrwurm&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TheDani708|title=wiseguys-Ohrwurm-lyrics|date=2012-03-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4rTYWjQkNU|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that tells a story about a man with a song stuck in his head that he can't get out and is designed to give you an earworm.

'''{{lang|de|italic=no|Erich Friedrich Wilhelm Ludendorff}}''' (9 April 1865 – 20 December 1937) was a [[Imperial Germany|German]] general, the victor of the [[Battle of Liège]] and the [[Battle of Tannenberg]]. From August 1916, his appointment as [[Generalquartiermeister|Quartermaster general]] ({{lang-de|Erster Generalquartiermeister}}) made him the leader (along with [[Paul von Hindenburg]]) of the German war efforts during [[World War I]].  The failure of Germany's great [[Spring Offensive]] in 1918 in quest of total victory was his great strategic failure and he was forced out in October 1918.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Astore, "The Tragic Pursuit of Total Victory." ''MHQ: Quarterly Journal of Military History'' (Autumn 2007) 20#1)  pp 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the war, Ludendorff became a prominent nationalist leader, and a promoter of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth]], which posited that the German loss in World War I was caused by the betrayal of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] by [[Marxism|Marxists]], [[Bolsheviks]], and [[Jews]] who were furthermore responsible for the disadvantageous settlement negotiated for Germany in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. He took part in the failed [[Kapp Putsch]] (coup d’état) with [[Wolfgang Kapp]] in 1920 and the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1923, and in 1925, he ran unsuccessfully for the office of [[President of Germany]] against his former superior Hindenburg.

From 1924 to 1928, he represented the [[German Völkisch Freedom Party|German {{lang|de|Völkisch|nocat=y}} Freedom Party]] in the {{lang|de|[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]}} (legislature). Consistently pursuing a purely military line of thought after the war, Ludendorff developed the theory of "[[Total War]]", which he published as {{lang|de|Der totale Krieg}} (''The Total War'') in 1935. In this work, he argued that the entire physical and moral forces of the nation should be mobilized, because [[peace]] was merely an interval between wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/350726/Erich-Ludendorff |title=Erich Ludendorff (German general) : Introduction – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=20 December 1937 |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludendorff was a recipient of the [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] and the [[Pour le Mérite]].

==Early life==
Ludendorff was born on 9 April 1865 in {{lang|pl|[[Kruszewnia]]}} near {{lang|de|[[Poznań|Posen]]}}, [[Province of Posen]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (now [[Poznań County|{{lang|pl|Poznań|nocat=y}} County]], [[Poland]]), the third of six children of August Wilhelm Ludendorff (1833–1905). His father was descended from [[Province of Pomerania (1653–1815)|Pomerania]]n merchants who had achieved the prestigious status of ''[[Junker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;William Brownell, and [[Denise Drace-Brownell]], ''The First Nazi: Erich Ludendorff, The Man Who Made Hitler Possible'' (2016) ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erich's mother, {{lang|de|Klara Jeanette Henriette von Tempelhoff}} (1840–1914), was the daughter of the noble but impoverished {{lang|de|Friedrich August Napoleon von Tempelhoff}} (1804–1868) and his wife {{lang|de|Jeannette Wilhelmine von}} {{lang|pl|Dziembowska}} (1816–1854), who came from a [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanized]] [[Poles|Polish]] landed family on the side of her father {{lang|pl|Stephan von Dziembowski}} (1779–1859). Through {{lang|pl|Dziembowski}}'s wife {{lang|de|Johanna Wilhelmine von Unruh}} (1793–1862), {{lang|de|Erich}} was a remote descendant of the [[Count]]s of {{lang|de|[[Dönhoff]]}}, the [[Duke]]s of {{lang|de|[[Duchy of Liegnitz]]}} and {{lang|de|[[Duchy of Brieg]]}} and the [[Marquess]]es and [[Prince-elector|Electors]] of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]].

He had a stable and comfortable childhood, growing up on their small family farm. Erich received his early schooling from his maternal aunt and had a gift for mathematics,&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parkinson |first1=Roger |title=Tormented warrior. Ludendorff and the supreme command |date=1978 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London |isbn=0-340-21482-1 |pages=13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as did his younger brother {{lang|de|[[Hans Ludendorff|Hans]]}} who became a distinguished astronomer. He passed the entrance exam for the Cadet School at {{lang|de|[[Plön]]}} with distinction,&lt;ref name="park"/&gt; he was put in a class two years ahead of his age group, and thereafter he was consistently first in his class. (The famous World War II General {{lang|de|[[Heinz Guderian]]}} attended the same Cadet School, which produced many well-trained German officers.) Ludendorff's education continued at the {{lang|de|Hauptkadettenschule}} at {{lang|de|[[Groß-Lichterfelde]]}} near Berlin through 1882.&lt;ref name="DHM" /&gt;

==Pre-war military career==
[[File:Hindenburg and Ludendorff.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] and Ludendorff (right)]]

In 1885, Ludendorff was commissioned as a [[subaltern]] into the 57th Infantry Regiment, then at [[Wesel]]. Over the next eight years, he was promoted to lieutenant and saw further service in the 2nd Marine Battalion, based at [[Kiel]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]], and in the 8th Grenadier Guards at [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt on the Oder]]. His service reports reveal the highest praise, with frequent commendations. In 1893, he entered the War Academy, where the commandant, General Meckel, recommended him to the [[German General Staff|General Staff]], to which he was appointed in 1894. He rose rapidly and was a senior staff officer at the headquarters of V Corps from 1902 to 1904.

Next he joined the Great General Staff in Berlin, which was commanded by [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], Ludendorff directed the Second or Mobilization Section from 1904–13. Soon he was joined by [[Max Bauer]], a brilliant artillery officer, who became a close friend. 

In 1910 at age 45 "the 'old sinner', as he liked to hear himself called"&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, 1978, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;  married the daughter of a wealthy factory owner, {{lang|de|Margarethe Schmidt}} (1875–1936).  They met in a rainstorm when he offered his umbrella. She  divorced to marry him, bringing three stepsons and a stepdaughter.&lt;ref name="DHM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/LudendorffErich/index.html |title=Biografie Erich Ludendorff (German) |publisher=[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] |date= |accessdate= 6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their marriage pleased both families and he was devoted to his stepchildren.

By 1911, Ludendorff was a full colonel. His section was responsible for writing the mass of detailed orders needed to bring the mobilized troops into position to implement the [[Schlieffen Plan|{{lang|de|Schlieffen|nocat=y}} Plan]].  For this they covertly surveyed frontier fortifications in Russia, France and Belgium.  For instance, in 1911 Ludendorff visited the key Belgian fortress city of [[Liège]].

Deputies of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], which became the largest party in the {{lang|de|[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]}} after the [[German federal election, 1912|German federal elections of 1912]], seldom gave priority to army expenditures, whether to build up its reserves or to fund advanced weaponry such as {{lang|de|[[Krupp]]}}'s siege cannons. Instead, they preferred to concentrate military spending on the [[Imperial German Navy]]. Ludendorff's calculations showed that to properly implement the Schlieffen Plan the Army lacked six corps.

Members of the General Staff were instructed to keep out of politics and the public eye,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Stein |first1=General |title=A War Minister and his work.  Reminiscences of 1914–1918 |date=1920 |publisher=Skeffington &amp; Son |location=London |page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Ludendorff shrugged off such restrictions. With a retired general, [[August Keim]], and the head of the Pan-German League, Heinrich Class, he vigorously lobbied the {{lang|de|Reichstag}} for the additional men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=John |title=The warlords : Hindenburg and Ludendorff |date=2005 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |page=44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913 funding was approved for four additional corps but Ludendorff was  transferred to regimental duties as commander of the 39th (Lower Rhine) [[Fusilier]]s, stationed at [[Düsseldorf]]. "I attributed the change partly for my having pressed for those three additional army corps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ludendorff |first1=Erich |title=Ludendorff’s Own Story |date=1919 |publisher=Harper and Brothers |location=New York |page=31 |volume=I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Tuchman]] characterizes Ludendorff in her book ''[[The Guns of August]]'' as Schlieffen's devoted disciple who was a glutton for work and a man of granite character but who was deliberately friendless and forbidding and therefore remained little known or liked. It is true that as his wife testified, "Anyone who knows Ludendorff knows that he has not a spark of humor...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ludendorff |first1=M |title=My married life with Ludendorff |date=1929 |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voluble nonetheless, although he shunned small talk. John Lee,&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 2005, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; states that while Ludendorff was with his Fusiliers, "he became the perfect regimental commander ... the younger officers came to adore him."  His adjutant, Wilhelm Breucker, became a devoted lifelong friend.

==Liège==
At the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914 Ludendorff was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff to the German Second Army under General [[Karl von Bülow]]. His assignment was largely due to his previous work investigating defenses of [[Liège]], Belgium. At the beginning of the [[Battle of Liège|Battle of Liège]], Ludendorff was an observer with the 14th Brigade, which was to infiltrate the city at night and secure the bridges before they could be destroyed. The brigade commander was killed on 5 August, so Ludendorff led the successful assault to occupy the city and its citadel. In the following days, two of the forts guarding the city were taken by desperate frontal infantry attacks, while the remaining forts were smashed by huge [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Krupp 42-cm]] and Austro-Hungarian Skoda 30-cm howitzers. By 16 August, all the forts around Liège had fallen, allowing the German First Army to advance. As the victor of Liège, Ludendorff was awarded Germany's highest military decoration for gallantry, the [[Pour le Mérite]], presented by Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] himself on 22 August.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, 1978. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Command in the East==
German mobilization earmarked a single army, the Eighth, to defend their eastern frontier. Two Russian armies invaded East Prussia earlier than expected, the Eighth Army commanders panicked and were fired by ''OHL'', {{lang|de|[[Oberste Heeresleitung]]}}, German Supreme Headquarters. ''OHL'' assigned Ludendorff as the new chief of staff, while the War Cabinet chose a retired general, [[Paul von Hindenburg]], as commander.  They first met on their private train heading east.  They agreed that they must annihilate the nearest Russian army before they tackled the second.  On arrival, they discovered that General [[Max Hoffmann]] had already shifted much of the 8th Army by rail to the south to do just that, in an amazing feat of logistical planning. Nine days later the Eighth Army surrounded most of a Russian army at [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]], taking 92,000 prisoners in one of the great victories in German history.  Twice during the battle Ludendorff wanted to break off, fearing that the second Russian army was about to strike their rear, but Hindenburg held firm.

Then they turned on the second invading army in the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Battle of the Masurian Lakes]]; it fled with heavy losses to escape encirclement.  During the rest of 1914, commanding an Army Group, they staved off the projected invasion of German [[Silesia]] by dexterously moving their outnumbered forces into [[Russian Poland]], fighting the battle of the [[Battle of the Vistula River|Vistula River]], which ended with a brilliantly executed withdrawal during which they destroyed the Polish railway lines and bridges needed for an invasion. When the Russians had repaired most of the damage the Germans struck their flank in the [[battle of Łódź (1914)|battle of Łódź]], where they almost surrounded another Russian Army.  Masters of surprise and deft maneuver, they argued that if properly reinforced they could trap the entire Russian army in Poland. During the winter of 1914–15 they lobbied passionately for this strategy, but were rebuffed by ''OHL''.

Early in 1915 they surprised the Russian army that still held a toehold in East Prussia by attacking in a snowstorm and surrounding it in the [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]].  ''OHL'' then transferred Ludendorff, but Hindenburg's personal plea to the Kaiser reunited them.  [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], supreme commander at ''OHL'', came east to attack the flank of the Romanian army that was pushing through the Carpathian passes towards Hungary.  Employing overwhelming artillery, the Germans and Austro-Hungarians broke through the line between [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive|{{lang|pl|Gorlice|nocat=y}} and {{lang|pl|Tarnów|nocat=y}}]] and kept pushing until the Russians were driven out of most of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], the Austro-Hungarian southern part of partitioned Poland.  During this advance Falkenhayn rejected schemes to try to cut off the Russians in Poland, preferring direct frontal attacks.  Outgunned, during the summer of 1915 the Russian commander [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]] shortened his lines by withdrawing from most of Poland, destroying railroads, bridges, and many buildings while driving 743,000 Poles,  
350,000 Jews, 300,000 Lithuanians and 250,000 Latvians into Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kershaw |first1=Ian |title=To Hell and back. Europe 1914–1949 |date=2015 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hindenburg-ludendorff.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hindenburg (seated) and Ludendorff. Painting by [[Hugo Vogel]]]]

During the winter of 1915–16 Ludendorff's headquarters was in [[Kaunas]].  They occupied present-day Lithuania, western Latvia, and north eastern Poland, an area almost the size of France. Ludendorff demanded Germanization of the conquered territories and far-ranging annexations, offering land to German settlers; ''see {{lang|de|[[Drang nach Osten]]}}''. Far reaching plans envisioned Courland and Lithuania turned into border states ruled by German military governor commanders answerable only to the German Emperor.&lt;ref name="Baranowski 2010"&gt;''Nazi Empire: German Colonialism and Imperialism from Bismarck to Hitler'', page 102,  Shelley Baranowski, Cambridge University, Press 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed  massive annexations and colonisation in Eastern Europe in the event of the victory of the German Reich, and was one of the main supporters of the [[Polish Border Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;''Armies of occupation'' page 128 Roy Arnold Prete, A. Hamish Ion - Wilfrid Laurier University Press 1984 &lt;/ref&gt; Ludendorff planned to combine German settlement and Germanisation in conquered areas with expulsions of native populations; and envisioned an eastern German empire whose resources would be used in future war with [[Great Britain]] and [[United States]]&lt;ref name="Baranowski 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The silent dictatorship: the politics of the German high command under Hindenburg and Ludendorff, 1916–1918''. page 193, Martin Kitchen&lt;/ref&gt; Ludendorff's plans went as far as making [[Crimea]] a German colony&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Germany, Volume 3: 1840–1945''. Hajo Holborn, page 488, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; As to the various nations and ethnic groups in conquered territories, Ludendorff believed they were "incapable of producing real culture" &lt;ref&gt;''The German Myth of the East: 1800 to the Present''. Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius - 2010, page 138&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 16 March 1916 the Russians, now with adequate supplies of cannons and shells, attacked parts of the new German defenses, intending to penetrate at two points and then to pocket the defenders.  They attacked almost daily until the end of the month, but the [[Lake Naroch Offensive]] failed, "choked in swamp and blood".&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''I''',  p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russians did better attacking the Austro-Hungarians in the south; the [[Brusilov Offensive]] cracked their lines with a well-prepared surprise wide-front attack led by well-schooled assault troops. The breakthrough was finally stemmed by Austro-Hungarian troops recalled from Italy stiffened with German advisers and reserves.  In July, Russian attacks on the Germans in the north were beaten back.  On 27 July 1916 Hindenburg was given command of all troops on the Eastern Front from the Baltic to [[Brody]] in the Ukraine.  They visited their new command on a special train, and then set up headquarters in [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]].  By August 1916 their front was holding everywhere.

==Military duumvirate with Hindenburg==
In the West in 1916 the Germans attacked unsuccessfully at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] and soon were reeling under British and French blows along the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]].  Ludendorff's friends at ''OHL'', led by Max Bauer, lobbied for him relentlessly. The balance was tipped when Romania entered the war, thrusting into Hungary.  Falkenhayn was replaced as Chief of the General Staff by Field Marshal Hindenburg on 29 August 1916.  Ludendorff was his chief of staff as first [[Quartermaster general]], with the stipulation that he would have joint responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parkinson |first1=Roger |title=Tormented warrior, Ludendorff and the supreme Command |date=1978 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |location=London |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[General of the Infantry (Germany)|General of the Infantry]].  Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg|Bethmann-Hollweg]] warned the War Cabinet: "You don't know Ludendorff, who is only great at a time of success. If things go badly he loses his nerve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Müller |first1=Georg |editor-last1=Görlitz |editor-first1=Walter |title=The Kaiser and his court : the diaries, notebooks, and letters of Admiral Georg Alexander von Müller, chief of the naval cabinet, 1914–1918 |date=1961 |publisher=Macdonald |location=London |page=406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Their first concern  was the sizable Romanian Army, so troops sent from the Western Front checked Romanian and Russian incursions into Hungary. Then Romania was invaded from the south by German, Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian, and Ottoman troops commanded by [[August von Mackensen]] and from the north by a German and Austro-Hungarian army commanded by Falkenhayn.  Bucharest fell in December 1916.  According to Mackensen, Ludendorff's distant management consisted of "floods of telegrams, as superfluous as they were offensive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Churchill|first1=Winston S.|title=The World Crisis|date=1949|publisher=Charles Scribner Sons|location=New York|page=685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When sure that the Romanians would be defeated ''OHL'' moved west, retaining the previous staff except for the operations officer, blamed for Verdun.  They toured the Western Front meeting {{mdash}}and evaluating{{mdash}} commanders, learning about their problems and soliciting their opinions.  At each meeting Ludendorff did most of the commander's talking. There would be no further attacks at Verdun and the Somme would be defended by revised tactics that exposed fewer men to British shells. A new backup defensive line would be built, like the one they had constructed in the east.  The Allies called the new fortifications the [[Hindenburg Line]]. The German goal was victory, which they defined as a Germany with extended borders that could be more easily defended in the next war.

Hindenburg was given titular command over all of the forces of the Central Powers. Ludendorff's hand was everywhere. Every day he was on the telephone with the staffs of their armies and the Army was deluged with "Ludendorff's paper barrage" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Binding |first1=Rudolph |title=A Fatalist at War |date=1929 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |page=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of orders, instructions and demands for information.  His finger extended into every aspect of the German war effort. He issued the two daily communiques, and often met with the newspaper and newsreel reporters. Before long the public idolized him as their Army's brain.

==The Home Front==
Ludendorff had a goal: "One thing was certain{{mdash}} the power must be in my hands."&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''2''', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  As stipulated by the [[Constitution of the German Empire]] the government was run by civil servants appointed by the Kaiser. Confident that army officers were superior to civilians, ''OHL'' volunteered  to oversee the economy:  procurement, raw materials, labor, and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feldman |first1=Gerald D. |title=Army, Industry and Labor in Germany 1914–1918 |date=1966 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |page=180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer, with his industrialist friends, knew exactly what should be done, beginning by setting overambitious targets for military production in what they called the [[Hindenburg Programme|Hindenburg Program]]. Ludendorff enthusiastically participated in meetings on economic policy{{mdash}} loudly, sometimes pummeling the table with his fists. Implementation of the Program was assigned to General [[Wilhelm Groener|Groener]], a staff officer who had directed the Field Railway Service effectively. His office was in the War Ministry, not in ''OHL'' as Ludendorff had wanted. Therefore, he assigned staff officers to most of the government ministries, so he knew what was going on and could press his demands.

War industry's major problem was the scarcity of skilled workers, therefore 125,000 men were released from the armed forces and trained workers were no longer conscripted.  ''OHL'' wanted to enroll most German men and women into national service, but the Reichstag legislated that only males 17–60 were subject to "patriotic service" and refused to bind war workers to their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=John |title=The warlords : Hindenburg and Ludendorff |date=2005 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groener realized that they needed the support of the workers, so he insisted that union representatives be included on industrial dispute boards. He also advocated an excess profits tax. The industrialists were incensed. On 16 August 1917 Ludendorff telegraphed an order reassigning Groener to command the 33rd Infantry Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kitchen |first1=Martin |title=The Silent Dictatorship. The Politics of the German High Command under Hindenburg and Ludendorff, 1916–1918 |date=1976 |publisher=Croom Helm |location=London |page=146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, "unable to control labour and unwilling to control industry, the army failed miserably"&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, 1966, p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt; (actually the government did control industry with its edicts and orders — and the result was disaster). To the public it seemed that Ludendorff was running the nation as well as the war. According to Ludendorff, "the authorities ... represented me as a dictator".&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919,'''I''', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  He would not become Chancellor because the demands for running the war were too great.&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919,  '''II''', 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Frank Tipton]] argues that while not technically a dictator, Ludendorff was "unquestionably the most powerful man in Germany" in 1917–18.&lt;ref&gt;Tipton, Frank B. ''A History of Modern Germany'' University of California Press, 2003, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

''OHL'' did nothing to mitigate the food disaster: despite the blockade everyone could have been fed adequately, but supplies were not managed effectively or fairly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van der Kloot |first1=William |title=Great scientists wage the Great War |date=2014 |publisher=Fonthill |location=Stroud |pages=71–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Spring 1918 half of all the meat, eggs and fruit consumed in Berlin were sold on the black market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moyer |first1=L. V. |title=Victory Must be Ours |date=1995 |publisher=Hippocrene Books |location=New York |page=284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In government==
The navy advocated unrestricted submarine warfare, which would surely bring the United States into the war. The Kaiser asked his commanders to listen to the warnings of his friend, the eminent chemist [[Walther Nernst]], who knew America well. Ludendorff promptly ended the meeting, it was "incompetent nonsense with which a civilian was wasting his time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mendelsohn |first1=Kurt |title=The World of Walther Nernst. The rise and Fall of German Science, 1864–1941 |date=1973 |publisher=MacMillan |location=London |page=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrestricted submarine warfare began in February 1917, with ''OHL''’s strong support.  This fatal mistake reflected poor military judgment in uncritically accepting the Navy’s contention that there were no countermeasures, like convoying, and confident that the American armed forces were too feeble to fight effectively. Ultimately Germany was at war with 27 nations.

In the spring of 1917 the Reichstag passed a resolution for peace without annexations or indemnities.  They would be content with the successful defensive war undertaken in 1914. ''OHL'' was unable to defeat the resolution or to have it substantially watered down. The commanders despised Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg as weak, so they forced his resignation by repeatedly  threatening to resign themselves, despite the Kaiser's admonition that this was not their business. He was replaced by a minor functionary, [[Georg Michaelis]], the food minister, who announced that he would deal with the resolution as "in his own fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Gaulle |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles de Gaulle |title=The enemy's house divided |date=2002 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, NC |page=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this put-down, the Reichstag voted the financial credits needed for continuing the war.

Ludendorff insisted on the huge territorial losses forced on the Russians in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], even though this required that a million German soldiers remain in the east. During the peace negotiations with the Romanians his representative kept demanding the economic concessions coveted by the German industrialists. The commanders kept blocking attempts to frame a plausible peace offer to the western powers by insisting on borders expanded for future defense. Ludendorff regarded the Germans as the "master race"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Delbrück |first1=Hans |title=Ludendorffs selbstportrait |date=1922 |publisher=Verlag für Politik und Wirtschaft |location=Berlin |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and after victory planned to settle ex-soldiers in the Baltic states and in [[Alsace Lorraine]], where they would take over property seized from the French.&lt;ref name="Ludendorff, 1919, II, p. 76"&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''II''', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; One after another ''OHL'' toppled government ministers they regarded as weak.

=="Peace Offensive" in the West==
In contrast to ''OHL's'' questionable interventions in politics and diplomacy, their armies continued to excel. The commanders would agree on what was to be done and then Ludendorff and the ''OHL'' staff produced the mass of orders specifying exactly what was to be accomplished. On the western front they stopped packing defenders in the front line, which reduced losses to enemy artillery.  They issued a directive on elastic defense, in which attackers who penetrated a lightly held front line entered a battle zone in which they were punished by artillery and counterattacks.  It remained German Army doctrine through [[World War II]]; schools taught the new tactics to all ranks.  Its effectiveness is illustrated by comparing the first half of 1916 in which 77 German soldiers died or went missing for every 100 British to the second half when 55 Germans were lost for every 100 British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van der Kloot |first1=William |title=World War I fact book |date=2010 |publisher=Amberley |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire |page=110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-127-09A, Paul von Hindenburg, Erich Ludendorff.jpg|thumb|upright=1.03|Hindenburg and Ludendorff (pointing), 1917]]

In February 1917, sure that the new French commander General [[Robert Nivelle]] would attack and correctly foreseeing that he would try to pinch off  the German salient between [[Arras]] and [[Noyon]], they withdrew to the segment of the [[Hindenburg line]] across the base of the salient, leaving the ground they gave up as a depopulated waste land, in {{lang|de|[[Operation Alberich]]}}. The [[Second Battle of the Aisne|Nivelle Offensive]] in April 1917 was blunted by mobile defense in depth. Many French units [[French Army Mutinies|mutinied]], though ''OHL'' never grasped the extent of the disarray. 
The British supported their allies with a successful attack [[Battle of Arras (1917)|near Arras]]. Their major triumph was capturing [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]], using innovative tactics in which infantry platoons were subdivided into specialist groups. The Ridge gave the British artillery observers superb views of the German line but elastic defense prevented further major gains.  
The British had another success in June 1917 when a meticulously planned attack, beginning with the detonation of mines containing more high explosive than ever fired before, took the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines Ridge]] in Flanders. This was a preface to the British drive, beginning at the end of July 1917, toward the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele Ridge]], intended as a first step in retaking the Belgian coast line. At first the defense was directed by General [[Fritz von Lossberg|von Lossberg]], a pioneer in defense in depth, but when the British adjusted their tactics Ludendorff took over day by day control. The British finally took the Ridge, it was impossible to stop determined attacks that inched forward for preset, limited gains, but the British paid a heavy price.

Ludendorff worried about declining morale, so in July 1917 ''OHL'' established a propaganda unit.  In October 1917 they began mandatory patriotic lectures to the troops, who were assured that if the war was lost they would "become slaves of international capital".&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''II''', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  The lecturers were to "ensure that a fight is kept up against all agitators, croakers and weaklings".&lt;ref&gt;Binding, 1929, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Following the overthrow of the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]], the new Russian government launched the [[Kerensky Offensive]] in July 1917 attacking the Austro-Hungarian lines in [[Galicia (Europe Europe)|Galicia]].  After minor successes the Russians were driven back and many of their soldiers refused to fight.  The counterattack was halted only after the line was pushed {{convert|240|km|mi}} eastwards.  The Germans capped the year in the East by capturing the strong Russian fortress of [[Battle of Jugla|Riga]] in September 1917, starting with a brief, overwhelming artillery barrage using many gas shells then followed by infiltrating infantry.  The Bolsheviks seized power and soon were at the peace table.

To bolster the wobbling Austro-Hungarian government, the Germans provided some troops and led a joint attack in Italy in October. They sliced through the Italian lines in the mountains at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]].  Two hundred and fifty thousand Italians were captured and the rest of Italian Army was forced to retreat to the Grappa-Piave defensive line.

On 20 November 1917 the British achieved a total surprise by attacking at [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]]. A short, intense bombardment preceded an attack by tanks which led the infantry through the German wire. It was Ludendorff's 52nd birthday, but he was too upset to attend the celebratory dinner. The British were not organized to exploit their break-through, and German reserves counterattacked, in some places driving the British back beyond their starting lines. The local German commander had not implemented defense in depth. 

[[File:Hindenburg, Kaiser, Ludendorff HD-SN-99-02150.JPG|thumb|left|325px|Hindenburg, Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], and Ludendorff, January 1917]]

At the beginning of 1918 almost a million munition workers struck; one demand was peace without annexations. ''OHL'' ordered that {{" '}}all strikers fit to bear arms' be sent to the front, thereby degrading military service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ludwig |first1=Emil |title=Hindenburg and the saga of the German revolution |date=1935 |publisher=William Heinemann |location=London |page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Russia out of the war, the Germans outnumbered the Allies on the Western Front.  After extensive consultations, ''OHL'' planned a series of attacks to drive the British out of the war. During the winter all ranks were schooled in the innovative tactics proven at Caporetto and Riga.  The first attack, [[Operation Michael]], was on 21 March 1918 near Cambrai.  After an effective [[hurricane bombardment]] coordinated by Colonel [[Georg Bruchmüller|Bruchmüller]], they slashed through the British lines, surmounting the obstacles that had thwarted their enemies for three years.  On the first day they occupied as large an area as the Allies had won on the Somme after 140 days.  The Allies were aghast, but it was not the triumph ''OHL'' had hoped for:  they had planned another Tannenberg by surrounding tens of thousands of British troops in the Cambrai salient,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zabecki |first1=David T. |title=The German 1918 Offensives: A case study in the operational level of war |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but had been thwarted by stout defense and fighting withdrawal. They lost as many men as the defenders; {{mdash}}the first day was the bloodiest of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herwig |first1=Holger L. |title=The First World War, Germany and Austria-Hungary 1914–1918 |date=1997 |publisher=Arnold |location=London |page=403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the dead was Ludendorff’s oldest stepson, a younger had been killed earlier. They were unable to cut any vital railway. When Ludendorff motored near the front he was displeased by seeing how:  "The numerous slightly wounded made things difficult by the stupid and displeasing way in which they hurried to the rear." &lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''II''', p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Americans doubled the number of troops being sent to France.

Their next attack was [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|in Flanders]]. Again they broke through, advancing {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and forcing the British to give back all of the ground that they had won the preceding year after weeks of battle.  But the Germans were stopped short of the rail junction that was their goal.  Next, to draw French reserves south, they struck along the {{lang|fr|[[Third Battle of the Aisne|Chemin de Dames]]}}. In their most successful attack yet they advanced {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the first day, crossing the Marne but stopping {{convert|56|km|mi}} from Paris.  But each triumph weakened their army and its morale. From 20 March 1918 to 25 June the German front lengthened from {{convert|390|km|mi}} to {{convert|510|km|mi}}.
Then they struck near Reims, to seize additional railway lines for use in the salient, but were foiled by brilliant French elastic tactics. Undeterred, on 18 July 1918 Ludendorff, still "aggressive and confident",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Lossberg |first1=Fritz |title=Meine Tätigkeit im Weltkriege 1914–1918 |date=1939 |publisher=E. S. Mittler &amp; Sohn |location=Berlin |page=343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; traveled to Flanders to confer about the next attack there.  A telephone call reported that the French and Americans led by a mass of tanks had smashed through the right flank of their salient pointing toward Paris, on the opening day of the [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Battle of Soissons]]. Everyone present realized that surely they had lost the war. Ludendorff was shattered. 

''OHL'' began to withdraw step by step to new defensive lines, first evacuating all of their wounded and supplies.  Ludendorff's communiques, which hitherto had been largely factual, now distorted the news, for instance claiming that American troops had to be herded onto troop ships by special police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurice|first1=Major-General Sir F.|title=The last four months: The end of the war in the west|date=1919|publisher=Cassell|location=London|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 1918 they were completely surprised at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]] when British tanks broke through the defenses and intact German formations surrendered. To Ludendorff it was the "black day in the history of the German Army".&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''II''', p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; The German retreats continued, pressed by Allied attacks. ''OHL'' still vigorously opposed offering to give up the territory they desired in France and Belgium, so the German government was unable to make a plausible peace proposal.

Ludendorff became increasingly cantankerous, railing at his staff without cause, publicly accusing the field marshal of talking nonsense, and sometimes bursting into tears.  Bauer wanted him replaced, but instead {{lang|de|Oberstabarzt}} Hochheimer was brought to ''OHL'', he had worked closely with Ludendorff in Poland during the winter of 1915–16 on plans to bring in German colonists,&lt;ref name="Ludendorff, 1919, II, p. 76"/&gt; before the war he had a practice in nervous diseases. The doctor "spoke as a friend and he listened as a friend",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Foerester |first1=Wolfgang |title=Der Feldherr Ludendorff im Unglück |date=1952 |publisher=Limes |location=Weisbaden |page=75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; convincing Ludendorff that he could not work effectively with one hour of sleep a night and that he must relearn how to relax.  After a month away from headquarters his patient had recovered from the severest symptoms of battle fatigue.

==Downfall==
On 29 September 1918 Ludendorff and Hindenburg told an incredulous Kaiser that they must have an immediate armistice. A new Chancellor, [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]], approached President [[Woodrow Wilson]] but his terms were stiff and the Army fought on. The chancellor told the Kaiser that he and his cabinet would resign unless Ludendorff was removed, but that Hindenburg must remain to hold the army together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Alexander |title=Ring of Steel. Germany and Austria-Hungary at war 1914–1918 |date=2014 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |page=551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kaiser called his commanders in, curtly accepting Ludendorff's resignation and then rejecting Hindenburg's. Ludendorff would not accompany the field marshal back to headquarters, "I refused to ride with you because you have treated me so shabbily".&lt;ref&gt;von  Müller, 1961,  p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludendorff had assiduously sought all of the credit, now he was rewarded with all of the blame. Widely despised, and with revolution breaking out, he was hidden by his brother and a network of friends until he slipped out of Germany disguised in blue spectacles and a false beard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goodspeed |first1=D. J. |title=Ludendorff Soldier: Dictator: Revolutionary |date=1966 |publisher=Rupert Hart-Davis |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and fake [[Finnish passport]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Jorma Keränen |title=Suomen itsenäistymisen kronikka: Ludendorff saa suomalaisen passin|url= |location=|publisher=Gummerus  |pages=153 |date= |isbn=951-20-3800-5}} {{fi}} &lt;/ref&gt;   settling in a Swedish admirer's country home, until the Swedish government asked him to leave in February 1919. In seven months he wrote two volumes of detailed memoirs. Friends, led by Breucker, provided him with documents and negotiated with publishers. Groener (who is not mentioned in the book) characterized it as a showcase of his "caesar-mania".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Breucker |first1=Wilhelm |title=Die Tragik Ludendorffs. Eine kritische erinnerung an den general und seine zeit |date=1953 |publisher=Helmut Rauschenbusch |location=Berlin |page=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a brilliant general, according to Wheeler-Bennett he was "certainly one of the greatest routine military organizers that the world has ever seen",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wheeler-Bennett |first1=John |title=Ludendorff: The Soldier and the Politician |journal=Virginia Quarterly |date=1938 |volume=14 |issue=2 |page=187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was a ruinous political meddler.  The influential military analyst [[Hans Delbrück]] concluded that "The Empire was built by {{lang|de|[[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Moltke]]}} and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], destroyed by [[Alfred von Tirpitz|Tirpitz]] and Ludendorff."&lt;ref&gt;Delbrück, 1922, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Great War==
In exile, Ludendorff wrote numerous books and articles about the German military's conduct of the war while forming the foundation for the {{lang|de|[[Dolchstosslegende]]}}, the "stab-in-the-back theory," for which he is considered largely responsible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nebelin, Manfred: ''Ludendorff: Diktator im Ersten Weltkrieg'', Munich: Siedler Verlag--Verlagsgruppe Random House, 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludendorff was convinced that Germany had fought a defensive war and, in his opinion, that Kaiser Wilhelm II had failed to organize a proper counter-propaganda campaign or provide efficient leadership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Ludendorff was extremely suspicious of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and leftists, whom he blamed for the humiliation of Germany through the [[Versailles Treaty]]. Ludendorff claimed that he paid close attention to the business element (especially the Jews), and saw them turn their backs on the war effort by — as he saw it — letting profit, rather than patriotism, dictate production and financing.

Again focusing on the left, Ludendorff was appalled by the strikes that took place towards the end of the war and the way that the home front collapsed before the military front did, with the former poisoning the morale of soldiers on temporary leave. Most importantly, Ludendorff felt that the German people as a whole had underestimated what was at stake in the war; he was convinced that the Entente had started the war and was determined to dismantle Germany completely.

Ludendorff wrote:
{{quote|By the [[German Revolution|Revolution]] the Germans have made themselves pariahs among the nations, incapable of winning allies, [[helots]] in the service of foreigners and foreign capital, and deprived of all self-respect. In twenty years' time, the German people will curse the parties who now boast of having made the Revolution. |author=Erich Ludendorff, ''My War Memories, 1914–1918''}}

==Political career in the Republic==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00344A, München, nach Hitler-Ludendorff Prozess.jpg|thumb|400px||Ludendorff (centre) with Hitler and other early Nazi leaders and prominent radical German nationalists]]

Ludendorff returned to Berlin in February 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1938/spring/wheelerbennett-ludendorff-soldier/ |title=Ludendorff: The Soldier and the Politician |author=John W. Wheeler-Bennett |journal=Virginia Quarterly |date=Spring 1938 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=187–202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Staying at the [[Hotel Adlon|Adlon Hotel]], he talked with another resident, Sir [[Neill Malcolm]], the head of the British Military Mission.  After Ludendorff presented his excuses for the German defeat Malcolm said "you mean that you were stabbed in the back?",&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, 1978, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; ironically coining a key catchphrase for the German right-wing.

On 12 March 1920 5,000 {{lang|de|[[Freikorps]]}} troops under the command of [[Walther von Lüttwitz]] marched on the Chancellery, forcing the government led by [[Friedrich Ebert]] and [[Gustav Bauer]] to flee the city. The putschists proclaimed a new government with a right-wing politician, [[Wolfgang Kapp]] as new "chancellor". Ludendorff and Max Bauer were part of the putsch. The [[Kapp Putsch]] was soon defeated by a general strike that brought Berlin to a standstill. The leaders fled, Ludendorff to Bavaria, where a right-wing coup had succeeded. He published two volumes of annotated {{mdash}}and in a few instances pruned {{mdash}} documents and commentaries documenting his war service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ludendorff |first1=Erich |title=Urkunden der Obersten Heeresleitung über ihre Tätigkeit, 1916–18 / herausgegeben von Erich Ludendorff |date=1920 |publisher=E. S. Mittler |location=Berlin }}&lt;/ref&gt; He reconciled with Hindenburg, who began to visit every year.

In May 1923 Ludendorff had an agreeable first meeting with [[Adolf Hitler]], and soon he had regular contacts with National Socialists. On 8 November 1923, the Bavarian {{lang|de|Staatskomissar}} [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr|Gustav von Kahr]] was addressing a jammed meeting in a large beer hall, the {{lang|de|Bürgerbräukeller}}. Hitler, waving a pistol, jumped onto the stage, announcing that the national revolution was underway. The hall was occupied by armed men who covered the audience with a machine gun, the first move in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]. Hitler announced that he would lead the {{lang|de|Reich}} Government and Ludendorff would command the army.  He addressed the now enthusiastically supportive audience and then spent the night in the War Ministry, unsuccessfully trying to obtain the army's backing. 

The next morning 3,000 armed Nazis formed outside of the {{lang|de|Bürgerbräukeller}} and marched into central Munich, the leaders just behind the flag bearers. They were blocked by a cordon of police, firing broke out for less than a minute. Most of the Nazi leaders were hit or dropped to the ground. Ludendorff and his adjutant Major Streck marched to the police line where they pushed aside the rifle barrels. He was respectfully arrested. He was indignant when sent home while the other leaders remained in custody. Four police officers and 14 Nazis had been killed, including Ludendorff's servant.

They were tried in early 1924. Ludendorff was acquitted, but Heinz was convicted of chauffeuring him, given a one-year suspended sentence and fined 1,000 marks. Hitler went to prison but was released after nine months. Ludendorff's 60th birthday was celebrated by massed bands and a large torchlight parade.  In [[German federal election, December 1924|1924]], he was elected to the Reichstag as a representative of the [[National Socialist Freedom Movement|NSFB]] (a coalition of the German {{lang|de|Völkisch}} Freedom Party ([[German Völkisch Freedom Party|DVFP]]) and members of the Nazi Party), serving until 1928. At around this time, he founded the Tannenberg League, a German nationalist organisation which was both anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic, and published literature espousing conspiracy theories involving Jews, Catholics &amp;ndash; especially [[Jesuit]]s &amp;ndash; and [[Freemasons]].&lt;ref name=evans201&gt;[[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Ricjard J.]] (2003) ''The Coming of the Third Reich'' New York: Penguin. pp.201-02 {{isbn|0-14-303469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his views became more extreme under the influence of his wife, [[Mathilde von Kemnitz]], Ludendorff gradually began to part company with Hitler, who was surreptitiously working to undermine the reputation of his one serious rival for the leadership of the extreme right in Germany.  Nonetheless, Ludendorff was persuaded to run for President of the Republic in the [[German presidential election, 1925|March 1925 election]] as the Nazi Party candidate, receiving only a pitiful 1.1 per cent of the vote; there is some evidence that Hitler himself persuaded Ludendorff to run, knowing that the results would be humiliating.&lt;ref name=evans201 /&gt; 

No one had a majority in the initial round of the election, so a second round was needed; Hindenburg entered the race and was narrowly elected. Ludendorff was so humiliated by what he saw as a betrayal by his old friend that he broke off relations with Hindenburg, and in 1927 refused to even stand beside the field marshal at the dedication of the [[Tannenberg memorial]].  He attacked Hindenburg abusively for not having acted in a "nationalistic soldier-like fashion". The Berlin-based liberal newspaper {{lang|de|[[Vossische Zeitung]]}} states in its article "Ludendorff's hate tirades against Hindenburg — Poisonous gas from Hitler's camp" that Ludendorff was, as of 29 March 1930, deeply grounded in Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="Ludendorff beschimpft Hindenburg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dfg-viewer.de/demo/viewer/?set%5Bimage%5D=2&amp;set%5Bzoom%5D=min&amp;set%5Bdebug%5D=0&amp;set%5Bdouble%5D=0&amp;set%5Bmets%5D=http%3A%2F%2Fzbw.eu%2Fbeta%2Fp20%2Fperson%2F7861%2F0437%2Fabout.de.xml |title=Ludendorff beschimpft Hindenburg | accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipton notes that Ludendorff was a [[social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] who believed that war was the "foundation of human society," and that military dictatorship was the normal form of government in a society in which every resource must be mobilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Modern Germany | author=Frank B. Tipton | year=2003| page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Margaret L. Anderson]] notes that after the war, Ludendorff wanted Germany to go to war against all of Europe, and that he became a pagan worshipper of the Nordic god [[Wōden|Wotan]] (Odin); he detested not only [[Judaism]], but also [[Christianity]], which he regarded as a weakening force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Margaret Lavinia Anderson |title=Dying by the Sword. The Fall of the Hohenzollern and Habsburg Empires" from History 167b, ''The Rise and Fall of the Second Reich'' |date=5 December 2007 |url=http://history.berkeley.edu/faculty/Anderson/H167B/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and death==
Ludendorff divorced and married  his second wife [[Mathilde von Kemnitz]] (1877–1966) in 1926. They published books and essays to prove that the world's problems were the result of Christianity, especially the [[Jesuits]] and [[Catholics]], but also conspiracies by Jews and the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]]. They founded the {{lang|de|[[:de:Bund für Deutsche Gotterkenntnis|Bund für Gotteserkenntnis]]}} {{de icon}} (Society for the Knowledge of God), a small and rather obscure [[esotericism|esoterical]] society of [[Theism|Theists]] that survives to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ludendorff.info/Wichtigste/englisch.htm |title=The God-cognition by Mathilde Ludendorff (1877–1966) |publisher=Bund für Gotterkenntnis Ludendorff e.V. |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007225053/http://www.ludendorff.info/Wichtigste/englisch.htm |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched several abusive attacks on his former superior Hindenburg for not having acted in a "nationalistic soldier-like fashion".

By the time Hitler came to power, Ludendorff was no longer sympathetic to him. The Nazis distanced themselves from Ludendorff because of his eccentric [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref&gt;David Nicholls, ''Adolf Hitler: A Biographical Companion'', ABC-CLIO, 1 January 2000, p.159.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 30 January 1933, the occasion of Hitler's appointment as Chancellor by President Hindenburg, Ludendorff sent the following telegram to Hindenburg: 

{{quote|I solemnly prophesy that this accursed man will cast our Reich into the abyss and bring our nation to inconceivable misery. Future generations will damn you in your grave for what you have done.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian. ''Hitler''. Longman, 1991, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Some historians consider this text to be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte. [http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1999_4.pdf 47. Jahrgang, Oktober 1999]}} (PDF; 7&amp;nbsp;MB), S. 559–562.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to regain Ludendorff's favor, Hitler arrived unannounced at Ludendorff's home on his 70th birthday in 1935 to promote him to field marshal. Infuriated, Ludendorff allegedly rebuffed Hitler by telling him: "An officer is named General Field-Marshal on the battlefield!  Not at a birthday tea-party in the midst of peace."&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, 1978, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote two further books on military themes, demonstrating that he still could think coherently about war despite his political and social prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ludendorff |first1=Erich |title=The nation at war |date=1936 |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |translator=A.S. Rappoport }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludendorff died of [[liver cancer]] in the private clinic {{lang|de|Josephinum}} in Munich, on 20 December 1937 at the age of 72.&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorffs Verlag: ''Der letzte Weg des Feldherrn Erich Ludendorff'', München 1938, S.&amp;nbsp;8: Das Kranken- und Sterbezimmer im Josephinum in München.&lt;/ref&gt; He was given — against his explicit wishes — a state funeral organized and attended by Hitler, who declined to speak at his eulogy. He was buried in the {{lang|de|Neuer Friedhof}} in [[Tutzing]] in [[Bavaria]].

'''Fair trade''' is a foundation whose stated goal is to help producers in [[developing country|developing countries]] achieve better trading conditions. Members of the movement advocate the payment of higher prices to exporters, as well as improved social and [[environmental law|environmental standards]]. The movement focuses in particular on commodities, or products which are typically exported from developing countries to [[developed country|developed countries]], but also consumed in domestic markets (e.g. Brazil, India and Bangladesh) most notably [[handicrafts]], [[Economics of coffee|coffee]], [[Cocoa bean#Production|cocoa]], wine, sugar, fresh fruit, [[chocolate]], flowers and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Brough | first = David | url = http://ca.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idCAL213911220080110 | title = Briton finds ethical jewellery good as gold | newspaper = Reuters | place = [[North America|NA]] | date = January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Moseley | first = WG | year = 2008 | title = Fair Trade Wine: North Africa's Post Apartheid Vineyards and the YouTube Global Economy| journal = Globalizations | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 291–304 | doi=10.1080/14747730802057753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement seeks to promote greater equity in international trading partnerships through dialogue, [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], and respect. It promotes [[sustainable development]] by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =WFTO | url = http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1082&amp;Itemid=334&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade is grounded in three core beliefs; first, producers have the power to express unity with consumers. Secondly, the world trade practices that currently exist promote the unequal [[distribution of wealth]] between nations. Lastly, buying products from producers in developing countries at a fair price is a more efficient way of promoting sustainable development than traditional charity and aid.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fair Trade from the Ground Up|last = Linton|first = April|publisher = University of Washington Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-295-99172-6|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fair trade labelling organizations commonly use a definition of ''fair trade'' developed by [[FINE]], an informal association of four international fair trade networks: [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), [[Network of European Worldshops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA). Specifically, fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. Fair trade organizations, backed by consumers, are engaged actively in supporting producers, [[raising awareness|awareness raising]], and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = What | publisher = European fair trade association | url = http://www.european-fair-trade-association.org/efta/Doc/What.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several recognized fair trade certifiers, including [[FLO International|Fairtrade International]] (formerly called FLO, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International), IMO, [[Make Trade Fair]] and Eco-Social. Additionally, [[Fair Trade USA]], formerly a licensing agency for the Fairtrade International label, broke from the system and is implementing its own fair trade labelling scheme, which has resulted in controversy due to its inclusion of independent smallholders and estates for all crops. In 2008, Fairtrade International certified approximately (€3.4B) of products.&lt;ref name="FLO2008"&gt;{{Citation | title = Facts &amp; figures | publisher = Fair trade | url = http://www.fairtrade.net/facts_and_figures.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = WTO | url = http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/its2006_e/its06_general_overview_e.pdf |format=PDF |title= General overview | year = 2006 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Trade Organization]] publishes annual figures on the world trade of goods and services.

The fair trade movement is popular in the UK, where there are 500 Fairtrade towns, 118 universities, over 6,000 churches, and over 4,000 UK schools registered in the Fairtrade Schools Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Paull | first = J | year = 2011 | contribution-url = http://orgprints.org/19527/1/Paull2011FairtradeISOFAR.pdf | contribution = The Fairtrade movement: Six lessons for the organics sector | title = Proceedings of the Third Scientific Conference of the International Society of Organic Agriculture Research | place = Namyangju, Korea | pages = 317–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, over 1.2 million farmers and workers in more than 60 countries participated in Fairtrade International's fair trade system, which included €65 million in fairtrade premium paid to producers for use developing their communities.&lt;ref name="fairtrade2009"&gt;{{Citation | title = Annual report | publisher = Fair trade | format = PDF | year = 2009 | url = http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/2011-12_AnnualReport_web_version_small_FairtradeInternational.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fairtrade International, nearly six out of ten consumers have seen the Fairtrade mark and almost nine in ten of them trust it.&lt;ref name="fairtrade2009"/&gt;

Some criticisms have been raised about fair trade systems. One 2015 study in a journal published by the [[MIT Press]] concluded that producer benefits were close to zero because there was an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade was actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Janvry|first1=Alain|last2=McIntosh|first2=Craig|last3=Sadoulet|first3=Elisabeth|title=Fair Trade and Free Entry: Can a Disequilibrium Market Serve as a Development Tool?|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|date=July 2015|volume=97|issue=3|pages=567–73|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research indicates that the implementation of certain fair trade standards can cause greater inequalities in some markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.&lt;ref name="Booth, P 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Booth | first1 = P. | last2 = Whetstone | first2 = L. | year = 2007 | title = Half a Cheer for Fair Trade | url = | journal = Economic Affairs | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 29–36 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0270.2007.00727.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perso2010"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carimentrand|first1= A.|last2= Ballet|first2= J. |year=2010|title= When Fair Trade increases unfairness: The case of quinoa from Bolivia|url= http://ethique.perso.sfr.fr/Working%20paper%20FREE-Cahier%20FREE%20n%B05-2010.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doppler, F. 2006"&gt;Working paper FREE-Cahier FREE n°5-2010; Doppler, F., &amp; Cabañas, A.A.

Positive and normative analysis from a value chain perspective', Journal of Business Ethics, 86, 3–26. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed alternative to fair trade is [[direct trade]], which eliminates the overhead of the fair trade certification, and allows suppliers to receive higher prices much closer to the retail value of the end product.  Some suppliers use relationships started in a fair trade system to autonomously springboard into direct sales relationships they negotiate themselves, whereas other direct trade systems are supplier-initiated for social responsibility reasons similar to a fair trade system.

== System ==
There are a large number of fair trade and ethical marketing organizations employing different [[marketing strategies]].{{Sfn | Ballet | Carimentrand | 2010}} Most fair trade marketers believe it is necessary to sell the products through supermarkets to get a sufficient [[volume of trade]] to affect the developing world.{{Sfn | Ballet | Carimentrand | 2010}} The Fairtrade brand is by far the biggest of the fair trade [[coffee]] brands.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Packers in developed countries pay a fee to The Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo, and nearly all the fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified fair trade cooperative, and there is a minimum price when the world market is oversupplied. Additionally, the cooperatives are paid an additional 10c per lb premium by buyers for [[community development]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bowes | first = John | year = 2010 | title = The Fair Trade Revolution | place = London | publisher = Pluto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed |date=December 2014}} The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as fair trade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices.{{Sfn | Mohan | 2010}}{{Pages needed | date = December 2014}}{{Sfn | Kilian | Jones | Pratt | Villalobos | 2006}}{{Sfn | Berndt | 2007}}{{Sfn | Kohler | 2006}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Renard | first1 = MC | first2 = VP | last2 = Grovas | year = 2007 | chapter = 9.

Some go to meeting the costs of conformity and certification: as they have to meet fair trade standards on all their produce, they have to recover the costs from a small part of their turnover,{{Sfn | Berndt | 2007}} sometimes as little as 8%,{{Sfn | Riedel | Lopez | Widdows | Manji | 2005}} and may not make any profit. Some meet other costs. Some is spent on social projects such as building schools, health clinics and baseball pitches. Sometimes there is money left over for the farmers. The cooperatives sometimes pay farmers a higher price than farmers do, sometimes less, but there is no evidence on which is more common.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections"&gt;{{Citation | last = Speaker | first = Griffiths | title = Why Fair trade isn't | url = http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm}}{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marketing system for fair trade and non-fair trade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms. Some independent brands operate a "virtual company", paying importers, packers and distributors and advertising agencies to handle their brand, for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, IA and A Crane, "Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies". ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 45: 79–92, 2003. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In the producing country, fair trade is marketed only by fair trade cooperatives, while other coffee is marketed by fair trade cooperatives (as uncertified coffee), by other cooperatives and by ordinary traders.{{Sfn | Mohan | 2010}}{{Sfn | Kilian | Jones | Pratt | &amp; Villalobos | 2006}}{{Sfn | Berndt | 2007}}{{Sfn | Riedel | Lopez | Widdows | Manji | 2005}}{{Sfn | Kohler | 2006}}

To become certified fair trade producers, the primary cooperative and its member farmers must operate to certain political standards, imposed from Europe. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;{{Citation | title = FLO-Cert | url = http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en | archivedate = 2009-09-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[fair trade debate]] there are many complaints of failure to enforce these standards, with producers, cooperatives, importers and packers profiting by evading them.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, LT 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Utting, K 2009, p 139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = J | last1 = Valkila| last2 = Haaparanta | first2 = P | last3 = Niemi | first3 = N | year = 2010 | title = Empowering Coffee Traders?

== Effect on growers ==
Fair trade is benefiting farmers in developing countries, whether that be considerably or just a little. The nature of fair trade makes it a global phenomenon, therefore, there are diverse motives for understanding group formation related to fair trade. The social transformation caused by the fair trade movement also varies around the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

[[File:Young women soil testing.jpg|thumb|Three young Nicaraguan women demonstrate to visiting US buyers and consumers the use of organic soil testing methods.|alt=Teaching organic soil testing in Nicaragua.]]

A study of coffee growers in [Guatemala illustrates the effect of fair trade practices on growers. In this study, thirty-four farmers were interviewed. Of those thirty-four growers, twenty-two had an understanding of fair trade based on internationally recognized definitions, for example, describing fair trade in market and economical terms or knowing what the social premium is and how their cooperative has used it. Three growers explained a deep understanding of fair trade, showing a knowledge of both fair market principles and how fair trade affects them socially. Nine growers had erroneous or no knowledge of Fair Trade.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The three growers who had a deeper knowledge of the social implications of fair trade all have responsibilities within their cooperatives. One is a manager, one is in charge of the wet mill, and one is his group's treasurer. These farmers did not have a pattern in terms of years of education, age, or years of membership in the cooperative; their answers to the questions, "Why did you join?" differentiate them from other members and explain why they have such an extensive knowledge of fair trade. These farmers cited switching to organic farming, wanting to raise money for social projects, and more training offered as reasons for joining the cooperative, other than receiving a better price for their coffee.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many farmers around the world are unaware of fair trade practices that they could be implementing to earn a higher wage. Coffee is one of the most highly traded commodities in the world, yet the farmers who grow it typically earn less than $2 a day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fair Trade Awareness and Engagement: A Coffee Farmer's Perspective|last = Fergus|first = Andrew|date = 2014|journal = Journal of the Center of Business Ethics, Bentley University|doi = 10.1111/basr.12037|pmid = |last2 = Gray |volume=119 |issue = 3|pages=359–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Martín de Pangoa, Peru, could answer positively that they have heard about fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their [[cooperatives]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some producers also profit from the indirect benefits of fair trade practices. Fair trade cooperatives create a space of solidarity and promote an entrepreneurial spirit among growers. When growers feel like they have control over their own lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be very empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As far as farmers' satisfaction with the fair trade system, the growers want consumers to know that fair trade has provided important support to their families and their cooperative. Overall, farmers are satisfied with the current fair trade system, but some farmers, such as the Mazaronquiari group from CAC Pangoa, desire yet a higher price for their products in order to live a higher quality of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Social premium ===
A component of trade is the social premium that buyers of fair trade goods pay to the producers or producer-groups of such goods. An important factor of the fair trade social premium is that the producers or producer-groups decide where and how it is spent. These premiums usually go towards socioeconomic development, wherever the producers or producer-groups see fit. Within producer-groups, the decisions about how the social premium will be spent is handled democratically, with transparency and participation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Producers and producer-groups spend this social premium to support socioeconomic development in a variety of ways. One common way to spend the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in public goods that infrastructure and the government are lacking in. These public goods include environment initiatives, public schools, and water projects. At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. They buy capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in public goods, like paying for teachers' salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Farmers' organisations that use their social premium for public goods often finance educational scholarships. For example, Costa Rican coffee co-operative, Coocafé, has supported hundreds of children and youth at school and university through the financing of scholarships from funding from their fair trade social premium. In terms of education, the social premium can be used to build and furnish schools too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 50 Reasons to Buy Fair Trade|last = Litvinoff|first = Miles|publisher = Pluto Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-7453-2584-2|location = |pages = |last2 = Madeley|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations promoting fair trade ==
Most of the fair trade import organizations are members of, or certified by one of several national or international federations. These federations coordinate, promote, and facilitate the work of fair trade organizations. The following are some of the largest:
* The [[FLO International]] (Fairtrade International), created in 1997, is an association of three producer networks and twenty national labeling initiatives that develop Fairtrade standards, license buyers, label usage and market the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fair trade Certification Mark]] in consuming countries. The Fairtrade International labeling system is the largest and most widely recognized standard setting and certification body for [[Fairtrade labeling|labeled Fair trade]]. Formerly named Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, it changed its name to Fairtrade International in 2009, when its producer certification and standard setting activities were separated into two separate, but connected entities. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT" /&gt; Fairtrade International, the non-profit arm, oversees standards development and licensing organization activity. Only products from certain developing countries are eligible for certification, and for some products such as coffee and cocoa, certification is restricted to cooperatives. Cooperatives and large estates with hired labor may be certified for bananas, tea and other crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fair trade | contribution = Generic standards | contribution-url = http://www.fairtrade.net/generic_standards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fair Trade USA&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fair trade | url = http://fairtradeusa.org/ | place = US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent, nonprofit organization that sets standards, certifies, and labels products that promote sustainable livelihoods for farmers and workers and protect the environment. Founded in 1998, Fair Trade USA currently partners with around 800 brands, as well as 1.3 million farmers and workers across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 2014 | title = General media kit | publisher = Fair trade | place = US | format = PDF | url = http://fairtradeusa.org/sites/default/files/General%20Media%20Kit%202014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Global Goods Partners]] (GGP), a fair-trade nonprofit organization, founded in 2005, which provides support and U.S. market access to women-led cooperatives in the developing world. 
* [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (formerly the International Fair Trade Association) is a global association created in 1989 of fair trade producer cooperatives and associations, export marketing companies, importers, retailers, national, and regional fair trade networks and fair trade support organizations. In 2004 WFTO launched the FTO Mark which identifies registered fair trade organizations (as opposed to the FLO system, which labels products).
* The [[Network of European Worldshops]] (NEWS!), created in 1994, is the umbrella network of 15 national [[worldshop]] associations in 13 different countries all over Europe.
* The [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA), created in 1990, is a network of European [[alternative trading organization]]s which import products from some 400 economically disadvantaged producer groups in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. EFTA's goal is to promote fair trade and to make fair trade importing more efficient and effective. The organization also publishes yearly various publications on the evolution of the fair trade market. EFTA currently has eleven members in nine different countries.

In 1998, the first four federations listed above joined together as [[FINE]], an informal association whose goal is to harmonize fair trade standards and guidelines, increase the quality and efficiency of fair trade monitoring systems, and advocate fair trade politically.
* Additional certifiers include IMO (Fair for Life, Social and Fair Trade labels), Eco-Social and Fair Trade USA.
* The [[Fair Trade Federation]] (FTF), created in 1994, is an association of Canadian and American fair trade wholesalers, importers, and retailers. The organization links its members to fair trade producer groups while acting as a clearinghouse for information on fair trade and providing resources and networking opportunities to its members. Members self-certify adherence to defined fair trade principles for 100% of their purchasing/business. Those who sell products certifiable by Fairtrade International must be 100% certified by FI to join FTF.

Student groups have also been increasingly active in the past years promoting fair trade products.&lt;ref name="fairtradecampaigns.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/universities/ |title=Universities &amp;#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hundreds of independent student organizations are active worldwide, most groups in North America are either affiliated with United Students for Fair Trade (USA, the Canadian Student Fair Trade Network (Canada), or Fair Trade Campaigns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/|title=Fair Trade Campaigns|website=fairtradecampaigns.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (USA), which also houses Fair Trade Universities&lt;ref name="fairtradecampaigns.org" /&gt; and Fair Trade Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/schools/ |title=Schools &amp;#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of church organizations has been and continues to be an integral part of the Fair Trade movement:

== History ==
{{Main article|History of fair trade}}
The first attempts to commercialize fair trade goods in Northern markets were initiated in the 1940s and 1950s by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs). Ten Thousand Villages, an NGO within the [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade [[supply chain]]s in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = History | url = http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml | publisher = IFAT | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215142239/http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml | archivedate = 2006-12-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The products, almost exclusively handicrafts ranging from [[jute]] goods to [[cross-stitch]] work, were mostly sold in churches or fairs. The goods themselves had often no other function than to indicate that a donation had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Unisg | title = Oikos foundation | url = http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060823071706/http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf | archivedate = 2006-08-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solidarity trade ===
[[File:Fair Trade Products.jpg|thumb|Fair trade goods sold in worldshops]]
The current fair trade movement was shaped in Europe in the 1960s. Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against neo-imperialism: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The slogan at the time, "Trade not Aid", gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archivedate = October 22, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141022065406/http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=17&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1 | url = http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=17&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1 |title= Where did it all begin?| accessdate = 24 June 2009 | date = 7 June 2009|publisher= WFTO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1965 saw the creation of the first [[Alternative Trading Organization]] (ATO): that year, British NGO [[Oxfam]] launched "Helping-by-Selling", a program which sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the UK and from mail-order catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = One Village | place = Charlbury, UK |url= http://onevillage.org/fairtrade-history.htm |title = Fair trade history | last = Scott | first = Roy | date=2003-03-07 |accessdate= 2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1968, the oversized newsprint publication, the [[Whole Earth Catalog]], was connecting thousands of specialized merchants, artisans, and scientists directly with consumers who were interested in supporting independent producers, with the goal of bypassing corporate retail and department stores. The Whole Earth Catalog sought to balance the international free market by allowing direct purchasing of goods produced primarily in US and Canada, but also in Central and South America.

In 1969, the first [[worldshop]] opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods produced under fair trade terms in "underdeveloped regions". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, Germany, and other Western European countries.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from Angola and Nicaragua in worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes, and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world's market.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

=== Handicrafts vs. agricultural goods ===
In the early 1980s, [[Alternative Trading Organizations]] faced major challenges: the novelty of some fair trade products began to wear off, demand reached a plateau, and some handicrafts began to look "tired and old fashioned" in the marketplace. The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, several fair trade supporters during this period were worried by the contemporary effect on small farmers of structural reforms in the agricultural sector as well as the fall in [[commodity]] prices. Many of them came to believe it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and remedies usable in the ongoing crisis in the industry.

In the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a much-needed, renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations a complement to the handicrafts market. The first fair trade agricultural products were tea and coffee, quickly followed by: dried fruits, cocoa, sugar, fruit juices, rice, spices and nuts. While in 1992, a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm, in 2002 handcrafts amounted to 25% of fair trade sales while commodity food lines were up at 69%.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. &amp; Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise of labeling initiatives ===
[[File:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]]&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Oldftlogos2.jpg: see image description page at [[:File:Oldftlogos2.jpg]] for rationale --&gt;Sales of fair trade products only really took off with the arrival of the first [[Fairtrade certification]] initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, North America. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0743-0167(02)00051-7 | last = Renard | first = M-C | year= 2003| title = Fair Trade: quality, market and conventions | url = |journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume=19 | pages =87–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.

A solution was found in 1988, when the first Fairtrade certification initiative, [[Stichting Max Havelaar|Max Havelaar]], was created in the Netherlands under the initiative of [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans Van Der Hoff]], and Dutch development NGO [[Solidaridad]]. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the worldshops and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The [[Fairtrade labelling|labeling initiative]] also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the supply chain.

The concept caught on: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America. In 1997, a process of convergence among labelling organizations – or "LIs" (for "Labeling Initiatives") – led to the creation of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers, and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/tasks.html | title = Main Tasks | work = Fair trade | accessdate = 27 January 2009 | year=2006 | publisher = FLO International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, FLO launched for the first time an International Fairtrade Certification Mark. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade, and simplify procedures for both producers and importers. At present, the certification mark is used in over 50 countries and on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, quinoa, herbs and spices, wine, [[Football (ball)|footballs]], etc.

With the rise of ethical labeling, consumers are able to take moral responsibility for their economic decisions and actions. This supports the notion of fair trade practices as "moral economies."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The presence of labeling give consumers the feeling of "doing the right thing" with a simple purchase.

These labeling practices place the burden of getting certification on the producers in the Global South, furthering inequality between the Global North and the Global South. The process of securing certification is excessively burdensome and expensive. Northern consumers are able to just make a simple choice without these burdens and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Alternative production and consumption relations?: fair trade, the state, and cooperatives in the global South|journal = Journal of Contemporary African Studies|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 0258-9001|pages = 1–17|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/02589001.2012.752958|first = Michelle|last = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology ==
Consumers of fair trade products usually make the intentional choice to purchase fair trade goods based on attitude, moral norms, perceived behavioral control, and social norms. It is useful to include of measure of moral norms to improve the predictive power of intentions to buy fair trade over the basic predictors, like attitude and perceived behavioral control.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

University students have significantly increased their consumption of fair trade products over the last several decades. Women college students have a more favorable attitude than men toward buying fair trade products and they feel more morally obligated to do so. Women are also reported to have stronger intentions to buy fair trade products.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender Differences in Psychosocial Determinants of University Students' Intentions to Buy Fair Trade Products|last = Valois|first = Pierre|date = 16 May 2014|journal = Journal of Consumer Policy|doi = 10.1007/s10603-014-9262-4|pmid = |last2 = de Leeuw|last3 = Morin|last4 = Schmidt |volume=37 |issue = 4|pages=485–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to the intentions to buy fair trade products, gender had no direct effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Producers organize and strive for fair trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or simply because they want to be paid more for their labor efforts and products. Farmers are more likely to identify with [[organic farming]] than fair trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fair trade farmers are also more likely to attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Product certification ==
{{Main article|Fair trade certification}}
''Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to the FLO product labeling system, see [[Fairtrade certification]]''
[[File:Fairtrade Certification Mark.svg|thumb|200px|International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]
Fairtrade labelling (usually simply Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certified in the United States) is a certification system designed to allow consumers to identify goods which meet agreed standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body ([[FLO International]]) and a certification body ([[FLO-CERT]]), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the agreed standards are met. For a product to carry either the International Fairtrade Certification Mark or the [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]], it must come from FLO-CERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the international Fair trade standards set by FLO International. The supply chain must also have been monitored by FLO-CERT, to ensure the integrity of the labelled product.

Fairtrade certification purports to guarantee not only fair prices, but also the principles of [[ethical purchasing]]. These principles include adherence to ILO agreements such as those banning child and [[slave labour]], guaranteeing a safe workplace and the right to unionise, adherence to the [[United Nations]] charter of [[human rights]], a fair price that covers the cost of production and facilitates social development, and protection and conservation of the environment. The Fairtrade certification system also attempts to promote long-term business relationships between buyers and sellers, crop prefinancing, and greater transparency throughout the supply chain and more.

The Fairtrade certification system covers a growing range of products, including bananas, honey, coffee, oranges, Cocoa bean, cocoa, cotton, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea, and wine. Companies offering products that meet the Fairtrade standards may apply for licences to use one of the Fairtrade Certification Marks for those products. The International Fairtrade Certification Mark was launched in 2002 by FLO, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new Certification Mark is currently used worldwide (with the exception of the United States). The Fair Trade Certified Mark is still used to identify Fairtrade goods in the United States.

There is widespread confusion because the fair trade industry standards provided by Fairtrade International (The Fairtrade Labelling Organization) use the word "producer" in many different senses, often in the same specification document. Sometimes it refers to farmers, sometimes to the primary cooperatives they belong to, to the secondary cooperatives that the primary cooperatives belong to, or to the tertiary cooperatives that the secondary cooperatives may belong to&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

== WFTO Fair Trade Organization membership ==
In an effort to complement the Fairtrade product certification system and allow most notably handcraft producers to also sell their products outside worldshops, the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) launched in 2004 a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations (as opposed to products in the case of FLO International and Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/the-fairtrade-marks.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): The Fairtrade Marks |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and seeks to guarantee that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour, and the environment. The FTO Mark offers Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable standards which inform consumers, business partners, governments, and donors of the applicable trading standard. in 2014 the Fairtrade Program Mark was introduced to create new sales opportunities, initially for cocoa, sugar and cotton producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fairtrade-sourcing-programs.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): Fairtrade International |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the same round logo alongside the word '''FAIRTRADE''' in black and underneath the program title in '''&lt;span style="color:turquoise"&gt;turquoise&lt;/span&gt;'''.

== Alternative trading organizations ==
{{Main article|Alternative trading organization}}
[[File:Cafedirectcoffeeshop.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cafedirect]] coffee shop on [[Regent Street]] in central London.]]

An alternative trading organization (ATO) is usually a non-governmental organization (NGO) or mission-driven business aligned with the Fair Trade movement, aiming "to contribute to the alleviation of poverty in developing regions of the world by establishing a system of trade that allows marginalized producers in developing regions to gain access to developed markets".&lt;ref name="European Fair 1998 p.23 &amp; 25"&gt;European Fair Trade Association (1998). Fair Trade Yearbook: Towards 2000. p.23 &amp; 25&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative trading organizations have Fair Trade at the core of their mission and activities, using it as a development tool to support disadvantaged producers and to [[poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], and combine their marketing with awareness-raising and campaigning.

Alternative trading organizations are often, but not always, based in political and religious groups, though their secular purpose precludes sectarian identification and evangelical activity. Philosophically, the grassroots political-action agenda of these organizations associates them with progressive political causes active since the 1960s: foremost, a belief in [[collective action]] and commitment to moral principles based on social, economic and [[trade justice]].

According to EFTA, the defining characteristic of alternative trading organizations is that of equal partnership and respect – partnership between the developing region producers and importers, shops, labelling organizations, and consumers. Alternative trade "humanizes" the trade process – making the producer-consumer chain as short as possible so that consumers become aware of the culture, identity, and conditions in which producers live. All actors are committed to the principle of alternative trade, the need for advocacy in their working relations and the importance of awareness-raising and advocacy work.&lt;ref name="European Fair 1998 p.23 &amp; 25" /&gt; Examples of such organisations are Ten Thousand Villages, Greenheart Shop, [[Equal Exchange]] and SERRV International in the US and [[Equal Exchange Trading]], [[Traidcraft]], Oxfam Trading, [[Twin Trading]] and Alter Eco in Europe as well as Siem Fair Trade Fashion in Australia.

== Universities ==
The concept of a Fair Trade school or Fair Trade university emerged from the [[United Kingdom]], where the Fairtrade Foundation now maintains a list of colleges and schools that comply with the needed requirements to be labeled such a university. In order to be considered a Fair Trade University, a school or university must have established a Fairtrade School Steering Group. They must have a written and implemented a school-wide Fair Trade Policy. The school or university must be dedicated to selling and using Fair Trade products. They have to learn and educate about Fair Trade issues. Finally, the Fairtrade Foundation requires that schools promote Fair Trade not only within the school, but throughout the wider community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A Fair Trade University is one that develops all aspects of Fair Trade practices in their coursework. In 2007, the Director of the Environmental Studies program at the [[University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh]], David Barnhill, started a push to become the first Fair Trade University. This push received positive reactions from faculty and students. To begin the process, the University as a whole agreed that it would need support from four institutional groups—faculty, staff, support staff, and students—to maximize support and educational efforts. The University officially endorsed the Earth Charter and created a Campus Sustainability Plan to align with the efforts of becoming a Fair Trade University.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The University of Wisconsin- Oshkosh also offers many courses in many different disciplines that implement fair trade learning. They offer a business course with a trip to [[Peru]] to visit coffee farmers, an environmental science class that discusses fair trade as a way for cleaner food systems, an English course that focuses on the [[Earth Charter]] and the application of fair trade principles, and several upper-level anthropology courses make fair trade the center of the class.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sustainability in Higher Education|last = Feldman|first = James|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-262-01949-1|location = |pages = 241–248|last2 = Barnhill|jstor = j.ctt9qf6bw.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2010, the [[University of California, San Diego]] became the second Fair Trade University in the United States. The University of California at San Diego understood the efforts of the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK, but they recognized they wanted to be more detailed about how their declaration as a Fair Trade University would make an actual change in the way on-campus franchises do business with the university. They also required constant assessment and improvement. The main premise of being a Fair Trade University for the University of California at San Diego is the promise between the university and the students about the continual effort by the university to increase the accessibility of Fair Trade Certified food and drinks and to encourage sustainability in other ways, such as buying from local, organic farmers and decreasing waste.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Fair Trade Universities have been successful because they are a "feel good" movement. The movement also has an established history, making it a true movement rather just a fad. Thirdly, Fair Trade Universities are effective because they raise awareness about an issue and offer a solution. The solution is an easy one for college students to handle, just paying about five cents more for a cup of coffee or tea can make a real difference.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Worldshops ==
{{Main article|Worldshop}}
[[File:Oxfam shop on Drury Lane.jpg|thumb|[[Oxfam#Shops|Oxfam shop]] on [[Drury Lane]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]]]
Worldshops or fair trade shops are specialized retail outlets offering and promoting fair trade products. Worldshops also typically organize various educational fair trade activities and play an active role in trade justice and other North-South political campaigns. Worldshops are often [[not-for-profit]] organizations and run by locally based volunteer networks. Although the movement emerged in Europe and a vast majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, worldshops can also be found today in North America, Australia and New Zealand.

Worldshops' aim is to make trade as direct and fair with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a [[developing country]] and consumers in [[industrialisation|industrialized]] countries. The worldshops' target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees substinence and guarantees positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain. A web movement has begun in the 2000s to provide fair trade items at fair prices to the consumers. One popular one is Fair Trade a Day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradeaday.com/|title=fairtradeday.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a different fair trade item is featured each day.

== World wide ==
Every year the sales of Fair Trade products grow close to 30% and in 2004 were worth over $500 million USD. In the case of coffee, sales grow nearly 50% per year in certain countries.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Raynolds | first1 = Laura T | first2 = Douglas | last2 = Murray | first3 = Peter Leigh | last3 = Taylor | title = Fair Trade Coffee: Building Producers Capacity Via Global Networks | journal = Journal of International Development | year = 2004 | pages = 1109–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 16,000 tons of Fairtrade coffee was purchased by consumers in 17 countries.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; "Fair trade coffee is currently produced in 24 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia".&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; The 165 FLO associations in Latin America and Caribbean are located in 14 countries and together export over 85% of the world's Fair Trade coffee.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; There is a North/South divide of fair trade products with producers in the South and consumers in the North. Discrepancies in the perspectives of these southern producers and northern consumers are often the source of ethical dilemmas such as how the purchasing power of consumers may or may not promote the development of southern countries.&lt;ref name="Moore, Geoff 2004"&gt;{{Citation | last = Moore | first = Geoff | title = The Fair Trade Movement: Parameters, Issues and Future Research | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 53 | issue = 1/2 | year = 2004 | pages = 73–86 | doi=10.1023/b:busi.0000039400.57827.c3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst the continuous growth, "[p]urchasing patterns of fairtrade products have remained strong despite the global economic downturn. In 2008, global sales of fairtrade products exceeded US$ 3.5 billion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = UNEP | year = 2011 | title = Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication | url = http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
Africa's exports come from the places such as South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. These exports are valued at $24 million USD.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009"&gt;Raynolds, Laura T., and Siphelo Unathi Ngcwangu. "Fair Trade Rooibos Tea: Connecting South African Producers and American Consumer Markets." Geoforum (2009): 74-83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the years of 2004 and 2006 Africa quickly expanded their number of FLO certified producer groups, rising from 78 to 171; nearly half of which reside in Kenya, following closely behind are Tanzania and South Africa.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; The FLO products Africa is known for are tea, cocoa, flowers and wine.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; In Africa there are smallholder cooperatives and plantations which produce Fair Trade certified tea.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; Cocoa-producing countries in West Africa often form cooperatives that produce [[fair trade cocoa]] such as [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; West African countries without strong fair trade industries are subject to deterioration in cocoa quality as they compete with other countries for a profit. These countries include [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], and the [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

=== Latin America ===
Studies in the early 2000s show that the income, education and health of coffee producers involved with Fair Trade in Latin America were improved, versus producers who were not participating.&lt;ref name="Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie 2011"&gt;Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie, and Eric J. Arnould. "Alternative Trade Organization and Subjective Quality of Life: The Case of Latin American Coffee Producers." Journal of Macromarketing (2011): 276-290. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil, Nicaragua, Peru and Guatemala, having the biggest population of coffee producers, make use of some of the most substantial land for coffee production in Latin America and do so by taking part in Fair Trade.&lt;ref name="Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie 2011" /&gt; Countries in Latin America are also large exporters of [[fair trade bananas]]. The [[Dominican Republic]] is the largest producer of fair trade bananas, followed by [[Mexico]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Costa Rica]]. Producers in the Dominican Republic have set up associations rather than cooperatives so that individual farmers can each own their own land but meet regularly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Fundación Solidaridad was created in [[Chile]] to increase the earnings and social participation of handicraft producers. These goods are marketed locally in Chile and internationally.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Fair trade handicraft and jewellery production has also shown a significant uplift over recent years, aided by North American and European online retailers developing direct relationships to import and sell the products online. The sale of fair trade handicrafts online has been of particular importance in aiding the development of female artisans in Latin America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixyfandino.com/empowering-the-female-artisan/|title=mixyfandino.com/empowering-the-female-artisan/|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
The Asia Fair Trade Forum aims to increase the competency of fair trade organizations in Asia so they can be more competitive in the global market. Garment factories in Asian countries including [[China]], [[Burma]], and [[Bangladesh]] consistently receive charges of human rights violations, including the use of child labour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; These violations conflict with the principles outlined by fair trade certifiers. In [[India]], Trade Alternative Reform Action (Tara) Projects formed in the 1970s have worked to increase production capacity, quality standards, and entrance into markets for home-based craftsmen that were previously unattainable due to their lower caste identity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

=== Australia ===
The Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand (FTAANZ) is a member-based organization that supports two systems of fair trade. The first is the Australia and New Zealand member of FLO International, which unites Fairtrade producer and labelling initiatives across Europe, Asia, Latin America, North America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The second, is the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), of over 450 worldwide members, to which FTAANZ is one. Fairtrade (one word) refers to FLO certified commodity and associated products. Fair trade (two words) encompasses the wider Fair Trade movement, including the Fairtrade commodities and other artisan craft products.

==Commodities ==
Fair trade commodities are goods that have been exchanged from where they were grown or made to where they are purchased, and have been certified by a fair trade certification organization, such as [[Fair Trade USA]] or [[World Fair Trade Organization]]. Such organizations are typically overseen by Fairtrade International. Fairtrade International sets international fair trade standards and supports fair trade producers and cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/about_us.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): Fairtrade International |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty percent of the fair trade market revolves around food products such as coffee, tea, cocoa, honey, and bananas.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000"&gt;Raynolds, Laura. "Re-embedding Global Agriculture: The International Organic and Fair Trade Movements." Agriculture and Human Values 17.3 (2000): 297-309. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-food commodities include crafts, textiles, and flowers. It has been suggested by Shima Baradaran of Brigham Young University that fair trade techniques could be productively applied to products which might involve [[child labor]].&lt;ref name="Fair Trade and Child Labor"&gt;{{cite journal|first2=Stephanie H. |last2=Barclay|title=Fair Trade and Child Labor|journal=Columbia Human Rights Law Review, Forthcoming|date=April 26, 2011|ssrn=1823546|accessdate=|author=Shima Baradaran|quote=fair trade should be considered as a proven alternative to current strategies to eliminate child labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fair trade represents only .01% of the food and beverage industry in the United States, it is growing rapidly and may become a significant portion of the national food and beverage industry.&lt;ref&gt;Raynolds, Laura T., Douglas L. Murray, and John Wilkinson. Fair Trade: The Challenges of Transforming Globalization. London: Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coffee ===
{{Main article|Fair trade coffee}}
[[File:Coffee beans being sorted and pulped.jpg|thumb|Fair trade [[coffee bean]]s being sorted]]
Coffee is the most well-established fair trade commodity. Most Fair Trade coffee is ''[[Coffea arabica]],'' a type of coffee known to be grown at high altitudes. A lot of emphasis is put on the quality of the coffee when dealing in Fair Trade markets because Fair Trade markets are usually specialized markets that appeal to customers who are motivated by taste rather than price. The Fair Trade movement fixated on coffee first because it is a highly traded commodity for most producing countries and almost half the world's coffee is produced by smallholder farmers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While initially sold at small scale, currently multinationals like Starbucks and Nestlé use fair trade coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement|url = http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/1/94|journal = Social Problems|date = 2012-02-01|issn = 0037-7791|pages = 94–116|volume = 59|issue = 1|doi = 10.1525/sp.2012.59.1.94|first = Daniel|last = Jaffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally recognized Fair Trade coffee standards have been outlined by FLO and are as follows: small producers are grouped in democratic cooperatives or groups, buyers and sellers establish long-term, stable relationships, buyers must pay the producers at least the minimum Fair Trade price or when the market price is higher, they must pay the market price, and finally, buyers must also pay a social premium of 20 cents per pound of coffee to the producers. The current minimum Fair Trade price for high-grade, washed Arabica coffee $1.40 per pound; the price increases to $1.70 per pound if the coffee is also organic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Locations ====
The largest sources of fair trade coffee are Uganda and Tanzania, followed by Latin American countries such as Guatemala and Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt; As of 1999, major importers of fair trade coffee included Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. There is a North/South divide between fair trade consumers and producers. North American countries are not yet among the top importers of fair trade coffee.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt;

==== Labour ====
Starbucks began to purchase more fair trade coffee in 2001 because of charges of labor rights violations in Central American plantations. Several competitors, including Nestlé, followed suit.&lt;ref name="Jaffee, Daniel 2012 pp. 94-116"&gt;Jaffee, Daniel: "Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement." Social Problems, Vol. 59, No. 1 (February 2012), pp. 94-116&lt;/ref&gt; Large corporations that sell non-fair trade coffee take 55% of what consumers pay for coffee while only 10% goes to the producers. Small growers dominate the production of coffee, especially in Latin American countries such as Peru. Coffee is the fastest expanding fairly traded commodity, and an increasing number of producers are small farmers that own their own land and work in cooperatives. Even the incomes of growers of fair trade coffee beans depend on the market value of coffee where it is consumed, so farmers of fair trade coffee do not necessarily live above the poverty line or get completely fair prices for their commodity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ransom, David. The No-nonsense Guide to Fair Trade. Oxford: New Internationalist Publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsustainable farming practices can harm plantation owners and laborers. Unsustainable practices such as using chemicals and unshaded growing are risky. Small growers who put themselves at economic risk by not having diverse farming practices could lose money and resources due to fluctuating coffee prices, pest problems, or policy shifts.&lt;ref name="Rice, Robert A 1999"&gt;Rice, Robert A (1999). "A Place Unbecoming: The Coffee Farm of Northern Latin America." Geographical Review: 89(4): 554-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of Fairtrade is questionable; workers on Fairtrade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the Fairtrade system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2014/05/agriculture-ethiopia-and-uganda?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/bl/notsofairtrade|accessdate=3 July 2014|title=Agriculture in Ethiopia and Uganda: Not so fair trade|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sustainability ====
As coffee becomes one of the most important export crops in certain regions such as northern Latin America, nature and agriculture are transformed. Increased productivity requires technological innovations, and the coffee agroecosystem has been changing rapidly. In the nineteenth century in Latin America, coffee plantations slowly began replacing sugarcane and subsistence crops. Coffee crops became more managed; they were put into rows and unshaded, meaning diversity of the forest was decreased and [[Coffea]] trees were shorter. As plant and tree diversity decreased, so did animal diversity. Unshaded plantations allow for a higher density of Coffea trees, but negative effects include less protection from wind and more easily eroded soil. Technified coffee plantations also use chemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides.&lt;ref name="Rice, Robert A 1999" /&gt;

Fair trade certified commodities must adhere to sustainable agro-ecological practices, including reduction of chemical fertilizer use, prevention of erosion, and protection of forests. Coffee plantations are more likely to be fair trade certified if they use traditional farming practices with shading and without chemicals. This protects the biodiversity of the ecosystem and ensures that the land will be usable for farming in the future and not just for short-term planting.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt; In the United States, 85% of fair trade certified coffee is also organic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;DeCarlo, Jacqueline. Fair Trade: A Beginner's Guide. Oxford, England: Oneworld, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer attitudes ====
Consumers typically have positive attitudes for products that are ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often are not willing to pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say they would be willing to pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelsmacker | first1 = De | last2 = Patrick | first2 = | last3 = Driesen | first3 = Liesbeth | last4 = Rayp | first4 = Glenn | year = 2005| title = Do Consumers Care about Ethics?

[[Safeway Inc.]] began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Jaffee, Daniel.

=== Cocoa ===
Many countries that export [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] rely on cocoa as their single export crop. In Africa in particular, governments tax cocoa as their main source of revenue. Cocoa is a permanent crop, which means that it occupies land for long periods of time and does not need to be replanted after each harvest.&lt;ref name="Willer and Yussefi 2008"&gt;Willer, Helga; Yussefi-Menzler, Minou und Sorensen, Neil, (Hrsg.) (2008) "The World of Organic Agriculture – Statistics and Emerging Trends 2008." IFOAM, Bonn and FiBL, Frick&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Locations ====
Cocoa is farmed in the tropical regions of West Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. In Latin America, cocoa is produced in Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. Much of the cocoa produced in Latin America is an organic and regulated by an [[Internal control]] system. Bolivia has fair trade cooperatives that permit a fair share of money for cocoa producers. African cocoa-producing countries include Cameroon, Madagascar, São Tomé and Príncipe, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, and Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref name="Willer and Yussefi 2008" /&gt; Côte d'Ivoire exports over a third of the world's cocoa beans.&lt;ref name="Brown, Michael Barratt 2007"&gt;Brown, Michael Barratt. "'Fair Trade' with Africa." Review of African Political Economy 34.112 (2007): 267-77&lt;/ref&gt; Southeast Asia accounts for about 14% of the world's cocoa production. Major cocoa-producing countries are Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcocoafoundation.org/our-work/where-we-work/ |title=Where We Work |publisher=World Cocoa Foundation |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Labour ====
One suggestion for the reason that laborers in Africa are marginalized in world trade is because the colonial division of labor kept Africa from developing its own industries. Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fair trade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.&lt;ref name="Brown, Michael Barratt 2007" /&gt; Most cocoa comes from small family-run farms in West Africa. These farms have little market access and thus rely on middlemen to bring their products to market. Sometimes middlemen are unfair to farmers. Farmers do not get a fair price for their product despite relying on cocoa sales for the majority of their income.&lt;ref name="Houston, Holly 2012"&gt;Houston, Holly, and Terry Wyer. "Why Sustainable Cocoa Farming Matters for Rural Development." Center for Strategic and International Studies, 6 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an [[Agricultural cooperative]]. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Michael K | year = 2004 | title = Reading fairtrade: political ecological imaginary and the moral economy of fairtrade foods | url = | journal = Political Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 7| pages = 891–915 | doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2004.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. In reality, much of this money goes to community projects such as water wells rather than to individual farmers. Nevertheless, cooperatives such as fair trade-endorsed [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in Ghana are often the only Licensed Buying Companies that will give farmers a fair price and not cheat them or rig sales.&lt;ref name="Berlan, Amanda 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berlan | first1 = Amanda | year = 2008 | title = Making or Marketing a Difference? An Anthropological Examination of the Marketing of Fair Trade Cocoa from Ghana | url = | journal = Research in Economic Anthropology | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 171–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers in cooperatives are frequently their own bosses and get bonuses per bag of cocoa beans. These arrangements are not always assured and fair trade organizations can't always buy all of the cocoa available to them from cooperatives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Marketing ====
The marketing of fair trade cocoa to European consumers often portrays the cocoa farmers as dependent on western purchases for their livelihood and well-being. Showing African cocoa producers in this way is problematic because it is reminiscent of the imperialistic view that Africans cannot live happily without the help of westerners. It puts the balance of power in favor of the consumers rather than the producers.&lt;ref name="Berlan, Amanda 2008" /&gt;

Consumers often aren't willing to pay the extra price for fair trade cocoa because they do not know what fair trade is. Activist groups are vital in educating consumers about the unethical aspects of unfair trade and promoting demand for fairly traded commodities. Activism and ethical consumption not only promote fair trade but also act against powerful corporations such as [[Mars, Incorporated]] that refuse to acknowledge the use of forced child labor in the harvesting of their cocoa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

==== Sustainability ====
Smallholding farmers not only frequently lack access to markets, they lack access to resources that lead to sustainable cocoa farming practices. Lack of sustainability can be due to pests, diseases that attack cocoa trees, lack of farming supplies, and lack of knowledge about modern farming techniques.&lt;ref name="Houston, Holly 2012" /&gt; One issue pertaining to cocoa plantation sustainability is the amount of time it takes for a cocoa tree to produce pods. A solution to this is to change the type of cocoa tree being farmed. In Ghana, a hybrid cocoa tree yields two crops after three years rather than the typical one crop after five years.

==== Harkin-Engel Protocol ====
The [[Harkin-Engel Protocol]], also commonly known as the Cocoa Protocol, is an international agreement that was created to end some of the world's worst forms of child labor, as well as forced labor in the cocoa industry. It was first negotiated by Senator Tom Harkin and Representative Eliot Engel after watching a documentary that showed the cocoa industry's widespread issue of child slavery and trafficking. The parties involved agreed to a six-article plan:

# Public statement of the need for and terms of an action plan—The cocoa industry acknowledged the problem of forced child labor and will commit "significant resources" to address the problem.
# Formation of multi-sectoral advisory groups—By 1 October 2001, an advisory group will be formed to research labor practices. By 1 December 2001, industry will form an advisory group and formulate appropriate remedies to address the worst forms of child labor.
# Signed joint statement on child labor to be witnessed at the ILO—By 1 December 2001, a statement must be made recognizing the need to end the worst forms of child labor and identify developmental alternatives for the children removed from labor.
# Memorandum of cooperation—By 1 May 2002, Establish a joint action program of research, information exchange, and action to enforce standards to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Establish a monitor and compliance with the standards.
# Establish a joint foundation—By 1 July 2002, industry will form a foundation to oversee efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. It will perform field projects and be a clearinghouse on best practices.
# Building toward credible standards—By 1 July 2005, the industry will develop and implement industry-wide standards of public certification that cocoa has been grown without any of the worst forms of child labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cocoainitiative.org/en/documents-manager/english/54-harkin-engel-protocol/file |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208022828/http://www.cocoainitiative.org/en/documents-manager/english/54-harkin-engel-protocol/file |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textiles ===
Fair trade [[textile]]s are primarily made from fair trade cotton. By 2015, almost 75,000 cotton farmers in developing countries have obtained Fairtrade certification. The minimum price that Fair trade pays allows cotton farmers to sustain and improve their livelihoods.&lt;ref name="Farmers' self-determination"&gt;Singh Anup Kumar. in E+Z / D+C [http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/fairtrade-improving-cotton-farmers-lot-africa-and-india] February, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade textiles are frequently grouped with fair trade crafts and goods made by artisans in contrast to cocoa, coffee, sugar, tea, and honey, which are agricultural commodities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Locations ====
India, Pakistan and West Africa are the primary exporters of fair trade cotton, although many countries grow fair trade cotton.&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J 2010"&gt;Bassett, Thomas J. "Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa." Geoforum, 2010. 41(1): 44-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Littrell, M. A. 1998"&gt;Littrell, M. A., and M. A. Dickson. "Fair Trade Performance in a Competitive Market." Clothing and Textiles Research Journal 16.4 (1998): 176-89&lt;/ref&gt; Textiles and clothing are exported from Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Labour ====
Labour is different for textile production than for agricultural commodities because textile production takes place in a factory, not on a farm. Children provide a source of cheap labor, and [[child labor]] is prevalent in Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Fair trade cooperatives ensure fair and safe labor practices, including disallowing child labor.&lt;ref name="Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000"&gt;Grimes, Kimberly M., and B. Lynne Milgram. Artisans and Cooperatives: Developing Alternative Trade for the Global Economy. Tucson: University of Arizona, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade textile producers are most often women in developing countries. They struggle with meeting the consumer tastes in North America and Europe. In Nepal, textiles were originally made for household and local use. In the 1990s, women began joining cooperatives and exporting their crafts for profit. Now handicrafts are Nepal's largest export. It is often difficult for women to balance textile production, domestic responsibilities, and agricultural work. Cooperatives foster the growth of democratic communities in which women have a voice despite being historically in underprivileged positions.&lt;ref name="Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000" /&gt; For fair trade textiles and other crafts to be successful in western markets, [[World Fair Trade Organization]]s require a flexible workforce of artisans in need of stable income, links from consumers to artisans, and a market for quality ethnic products.&lt;ref name="Littrell, M. A. 1998" /&gt;

However, making cotton and textiles fair trade does not always benefit laborers. Burkina Faso and Mali export the largest amount of cotton in Africa. Although many cotton plantations in these countries attained fair trade certification in the 1990s, participation in fair trade further ingrains existing power relations and inequalities that cause poverty in Africa rather than challenging them. Fair trade does not do much for farmers when it does not challenge the system that marginalizes producers. Despite not empowering farmers, the change to fair trade cotton has positive effects including female participation in cultivation.&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J 2010" /&gt;

Textiles and garments are intricate and require one individual operator, in contrast to the collective farming of coffee and cocoa beans. Textiles are not a straightforward commodity because to be fairly traded, there must be regulation in cotton cultivation, dyeing, stitching, and every other step in the process of textile production.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Fair trade textiles must not be confused with the sweat-free movement although the two movements intersect at the worker level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Forced or unfair labor in textile production is not limited to developing countries. Charges of use of [[sweatshop]] labor are endemic in the United States. Immigrant women work long hours and receive less than minimum wage. In the United States, there is more of a stigma against child labor than forced labor in general. Consumers in the United States are willing to suspend the importation of textiles made with child labor in other countries but do not expect their exports to be suspended by other countries, even when produced using [[forced labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwati, Jagdish.

=== Seafood ===
With increasing media scrutiny of the conditions of fishermen, particularly Southeast Asia, the lack of transparency and traceability in the [[seafood]] industry prompted new efforts. In 2014, [[Fair Trade USA]] created its Capture Fisheries Program that led to the first instance of Fair Trade fish being sold globally in 2015. The program "requires fishermen to source and trade according to standards that protect fundamental human rights, prevent forced and child labor, establish safe working conditions, regulate work hours and benefits, and enable responsible resource management." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Responsibility in the Global Seafood Industry|url=https://www.fishwise.org/images/white_papers/Social_Responsibility_in_the_Global_Seafood_Industry.pdf|website=FishWise|publisher=FishWise|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large companies and commodities ===
Large transnational companies have begun to use fair trade commodities in their products. In April 2000, [[Starbucks]] began offering fair trade coffee in all of their stores. In 2005, the company promised to purchase ten million pounds of fair trade coffee over the next 18 months. This would account for a quarter of the fair trade coffee purchases in the United States and 3% of Starbucks' total coffee purchases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; The company maintains that increasing its fair trade purchases would require an unprofitable reconstruction of the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macdonald | first1 = Kate | year = 2007 | title = Globalising Justice within Coffee Supply Chains? Fair Trade, Starbucks and the Transformation of Supply Chain Governance | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 793–812 | doi=10.1080/01436590701336663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade activists have made gains with other companies: [[Sara Lee Corporation]] in 2002 and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (the maker of [[Folgers]]) in 2003 agreed to begin selling a small amount of fair trade coffee. [[Nestlé]], the world's biggest coffee trader, began selling a blend of fair trade coffee in 2005.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; In 2006, [[The Hershey Company]] acquired [[Dagoba Chocolate|Dagoba]], an organic and fair trade chocolate brand.

Much contention surrounds the issue of fair trade products becoming a part of large companies. Starbucks is still only 3% fair trade – enough to appease consumers, but not enough to make a real difference to small farmers, according to some activists. The ethics of buying fair trade from a company that is not committed to the cause are questionable; these products are only making a small dent in a big company even though these companies' products account for a significant portion of global fair trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

=== Luxury commodities ===

There have been efforts to introduce fair trade practices to the [[luxury goods]] industry, particularly for gold and diamonds.

==== Diamonds and sourcing ====

In parallel to efforts to commoditize diamonds, some industry players have launched campaigns to introduce benefits to mining centers in the developing world. Rapaport Fair Trade was established with the goal "to provide ethical education for jewelry suppliers, buyers, first time or seasoned diamond buyers, social activists, students, and anyone interested in jewelry, trends, and ethical luxury."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapaportfairtrade.com/What-is-RapFT/About.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=Rapaport Fair Trade |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's founder, [[Martin Rapaport]], as well as [[Kimberley Process]] initiators Ian Smillie and [[Global Witness]], are among several industry insiders and observers who have called for greater checks and certification programs among many other programs that would ensure protection for miners and producers in developing countries. Smillie and Global Witness have since withdrawn support for the Kimberley Process. Other concerns in the diamond industry include working conditions in diamond cutting centers as well as the use of child labor. Both of these concerns come up when considering issues in Surat, India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/02/rough_cut Rough Cut] Foreign Policy, 2 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gold ====
Brilliant Earth has committed itself to using fair-trade-certified gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Couple-s-ringing-endorsement-of-ethical-jewelry-3217614.php Couple's ringing endorsement of ethical jewelry] SFGate&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, the United Kingdom's Fairtrade Foundation became the first NGO to begin certifying gold under the fair trade rubric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/fairtrade-gold |title=Fairtrade Gold &amp;#124; Shaping Sustainable Markets |publisher=Shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pornography or Sex industry ===
The concept of fair trade also influence the [[porn]] industry. Feminist columnists in several publication have written articles toward a pornography industry with mutual consent and no exploiting labor condition to actors and actresses. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/life/ethical-porn-474913&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ethical-porn/&lt;/ref&gt; There are also academic discourse about these facets. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1080/23268743.2014.888251|title = Fair-trade porn + niche markets + feminist audience|journal = Porn Studies|volume = 1|pages = 189–192|year = 2014|last1 = Mondin|first1 = Alessandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1177/0966735010384332|title = Fair Trade Sex: Reflections on God, Sex, and Economics|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 19|issue = 2|pages = 194–207|year = 2010|last1 = Cooper|first1 = Thia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
[[File:Faitrade display.jpg|thumb|Display of Fairtrade products at the [[Derbyshire County Council]] head office]]
In 1994, the [[European Commission]] prepared the "Memo on alternative trade" in which it declared its support for strengthening Fair Trade in the South and North and its intention to establish an EC Working Group on Fair Trade. Furthermore, the same year, the [[European Parliament]] adopted the "Resolution on promoting fairness and solidarity in North South trade" (OJ C 44, 14 February 1994), a resolution voicing its support for fair trade. In 1996, the [[Economic and Social Committee]] adopted an "Opinion on the European 'Fair Trade' marking movement". A year later, in 1997, the document was followed by a resolution adopted by the European Parliament, calling on the [[European Commission]] to support Fair Trade banana operators. The same year, the European Commission published a survey on "Attitudes of EU consumers to Fair Trade bananas", concluding that Fair Trade bananas would be commercially viable in several EU Member States.&lt;ref name="FINE2006"&gt;FINE (2006). Business Unusual. Brussels: Fair Trade Advocacy Office&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the European Parliament adopted the "Resolution on Fair Trade" (OJ C 226/73, 20 July 1998), which was followed by the Commission in 1999 that adopted the "Communication from the Commission to the Council on 'Fair Trade'" COM(1999) 619 final, 29 November 1999. In 2000, public institutions in Europe started purchasing Fairtrade Certified coffee and tea. Furthermore, that year, the [[Cotonou Agreement]] made specific reference to the promotion of Fair Trade in article 23(g) and in the Compendium. The [[European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/36/EC]] also suggested promoting Fair Trade.&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt; In 2001 and 2002, several other EU papers explicitly mentioned fair trade, most notably the 2001 Green Paper on [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] and the 2002 Communication on Trade and Development.

In 2004, the [[European Union]] adopted the "Agricultural Commodity Chains, Dependence and Poverty – A proposal for an EU Action Plan", with a specific reference to the Fair Trade movement which has "been setting the trend for a more socio-economically responsible trade." (COM(2004)0089). In 2005, in the European Commission communication "Policy Coherence for Development – Accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals", (COM(2005) 134 final, 12 April 2005), fair trade is mentioned as "a tool for poverty reduction and sustainable development".&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt;

On July 6, 2006, the European Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution on fair trade, recognizing the benefits achieved by the Fair Trade movement, suggesting the development of an EU-wide policy on Fair Trade, defining criteria that need to be fulfilled under fair trade to protect it from abuse and calling for greater support to Fair Trade (EP resolution "Fair Trade and development", 6 July 2006). "This resolution responds to the impressive growth of Fair Trade, showing the increasing interest of European consumers in responsible purchasing," said [[European Green Party|Green]] MEP [[Frithjof Schmidt]] during the plenary debate. [[Peter Mandelson]], EU Commissioner for External Trade, responded that the resolution will be well received at the [[European Commission]]. "Fair Trade makes the consumers think and therefore it is even more valuable. We need to develop a coherent policy framework and this resolution will help us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade-advocacy.org/ftao-publications/press-releases/press-release-2006/157-european-parliament-supports-fair-trade|title=European Parliament supports Fair Trade|website=www.fairtrade-advocacy.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
In 2005, French [[French National Assembly|parliament]] member [[Antoine Herth]] issued the report "40 proposals to sustain the development of Fair Trade". The report was followed the same year by a law, proposing to establish a commission to recognize fair trade Organisations (article 60 of law no. 2005-882, Small and Medium Enterprises, 2 August 2005).&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt; In parallel to the legislativents, also in 2006, the French chapter of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (AFNOR) adopted a reference document on Fair Trade after five years of discussion.

=== Italy ===
In 2006, Italian lawmakers started debating how to introduce a law on fair trade in [[Parliament of Italy|Parliament]]. A consultation process involving a wide range of stakeholders was launched in early October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=72176 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312214105/http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=72176 |archivedate=2007-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common definition of fair trade was most notably developed. However, its adoption is still pending as the efforts were stalled by the [[2008 Italian political crisis]].

=== Netherlands ===
The Dutch province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] was sued in 2007 by coffee supplier [[Douwe Egberts]] for explicitly requiring its coffee suppliers to meet fair trade criteria, most notably the payment of a minimum price and a development premium to producer cooperatives. Douwe Egberts, which sells a number of coffee brands under self-developed ethical criteria, believed the requirements were discriminatory. After several months of discussions and legal challenges, the province of Groningen prevailed in a well-publicized judgement. Coen de Ruiter, director of the Max Havelaar Foundation, called the victory a landmark event: "it provides governmental institutions the freedom in their purchasing policy to require suppliers to provide coffee that bears the fair trade criteria, so that a substantial and meaningful contribution is made in the fight against poverty through the daily cup of coffee".&lt;ref&gt;Max Havelaar Foundation (2007). [85.82.218.199/fileadmin/Bruger_filer/Dokument_database/IKAvaerktoej/EU_siden/Max_Havalaar.pdf Dutch Province of Groningen wins summary brought by Doug Egberts and can continue specifying fair trade coffee]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{Main article|Fair trade debate}}
{{Criticism section|date=February 2013}}

=== What occurs with the money? ===

==== Little money may reach the developing countries ====
The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much extra retailers charge for fair trade goods, so it is rarely possible to determine how much extra is charged or how much reaches the producers, in spite of l unfair trading legislation. In four cases it has been possible to find out. One British café chain was passing on less than one percent of the extra charged to the exporting cooperative;&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt; in Finland, Valkila, Haaparanta and Niemi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valkila | first1 = J. | last2 = Haaparanta | first2 = P. | last3 = Niemi | first3 = N. | year = 2010 | title = Empowering Coffee Traders?

==== Less money reaches farmers ====
The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much of the extra money paid to the exporting cooperatives reaches the farmer. The cooperatives incur costs in reaching fair trade political standards, and these are incurred on all production, even if only a small amount is sold at fair trade prices. The most successful cooperatives appear to spend a third of the extra price received on this: some less successful cooperatives spend more than they gain. While this appears to be agreed by proponents and critics of fair trade,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Utting-Chamorro, K (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, Volume 15, Numbers 3 and 4, June 2005, Berndt, C.E. (2007). Is Fair Trade in coffee production fair and useful? Evidence from Costa Rica and Guatemala and implications for policy. Washington DC.: Mercatus 65 Policy Series, Policy Comment 11, Mercatus Centre, George Mason University.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a dearth of economic studies setting out the actual revenues and what the money was spent on. FLO figures&lt;ref name="Labelling"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International |title=Annual Report 2009–2010 |year= 2010 |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |url= http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/FLO_Annual-Report-2009_komplett_double_web.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; are that 40% of the money reaching the [[developing world]] is spent on 'business and production' which would include these costs, as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the marketing system. The rest is stated to be spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.

Anecdotes state that farmers were paid more or less by traders than by fair trade cooperatives. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets,&lt;ref&gt;See Bowbrick, P, "Are price reporting systems of any use?", British Food Journal. 90(2) 65–69 March/April. 1988. Current international research on developing world market information systems is given at [http://www.sim2g.org/ sim2.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and few appreciate the complexity of the different price packages which may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they pay less than traders at some times, more at others. Bassett (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, T. (2009). Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt; is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same monopsonistic ginneries which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs they incur to produce fair trade. For instance, fair trade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, which resulted in a higher price per pound, but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). "Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee". ''Journal of Business Research'' 59(3), 322–330.; Valkila, J. (2009). Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua – Sustainable development or a poverty trap? ''Ecological Economics'' 68 3018–25; Wilson, B. R. (2009). Indebted to Fair Trade? Coffee and Crisis in Nicaragua. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects of low barriers to entry ====
A 2015 study concluded that the low barriers to entry in a competitive market such as coffee undermines any effort to give higher benefits to producers through fair trade. They used data from Central America, to establish that the producer benefits were close to zero. This is because there is an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade is actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"/&gt;

=== Inefficient marketing system ===
One reason for high prices is that fair trade farmers have to sell through a [[monopsonist]] cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt – certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; if they wish to retain fairtrade status. There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. [[Brink Lindsey]] calls fair trade a "misguided attempt to make up for market failures" encouraging market inefficiencies and overproduction.&lt;ref name="Brink"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517134810/http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fair trade harms other farmers ===

==== Overproduction argument ====
Critics argue that fair trade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fair trade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on increasing yields and quality. Economists&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref name="Brink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) 'Half a Cheer for Fair Trade', Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29–36; Sidwell, M. (2008) Unfair Trade, London: Adam Smith Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harford, T: "The Undercover Economist.", 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Markets, poverty, and Fair Trade | author = Sam Bowman | date = 11 March 2011 | url = http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/tax-and-economy/markets,-poverty,-and-fair-trade/ | publisher = [[Adam Smith Institute]] | accessdate = 2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = The Economist | date = Dec 7, 2006 | url = http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8380592 | title = Voting with your trolley }}&lt;/ref&gt; state that, if this is indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The fair trade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-fair trade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.{{refneeded|date=October 2017}}

=== Other ethical issues ===

==== Secrecy ====
Under EU law ([[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|Directive 2005/29/EC]] on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) 'it contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct', (b) 'it omits material information that the average consumer needs ... and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise' or (c) 'fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice ... [which] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.' [[Peter Griffiths (economist)| 	
Peter Griffiths]] (2011)&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt; points to false claims that fair trade producers get higher prices, the almost universal failure to disclose the extra price charged for fair trade products, to disclose how much of this actually reaches the developing world, to disclose what this is spent on in the developing world, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that Fairtrade does to non-fair trade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries.

==== Unethical selling techniques ====
[[Philip Booth (economist)|Philip Booth]] says that the selling techniques used by some sellers and some supporters of fair trade are bullying, misleading, and unethical.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&amp;ID=437&lt;/ref&gt; There are problems with the use of boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect. However, the opposite has been argued, that a more participatory and multi-stakeholder approach to auditing might improve the quality of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=807 |title=IDS Bookshop – Item details |publisher=Ntd.co.uk |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people argue that these practices are justifiable: that strategic use of labeling may help embarrass (or encourage) major suppliers into changing their practices. They may make transparent corporate vulnerabilities that activists can exploit. Or they may encourage ordinary people to get involved with broader projects of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Julie Guthman | year = 2007 | journal = Antipode | title = The Polanyian Way? Voluntary Food Labels as Neoliberal Governance | volume = 39 | pages = 456–78 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2007.00535.x | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failure to monitor standards ===
There are complaints that the standards are inappropriate and may harm producers, sometimes making them work several months more for little return.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Utting-Chamorro | first1 = K | year = 2005 | title = Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua | url = | journal = Development in Practice | volume = 15 | issue = 3, 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moberg M (2005). "Fairtrade and Eastern Caribbean Banana Farmers: Rhetoric and Reality in the Anti-Globalization Movement." Human Organization 64:4–16, Cited in Nelson and Pound (2009) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="valkila2009" /&gt;

Adherence to fair trade standards by producers has been poor, and enforcement of standards by Fairtrade is weak. Notably by Christian Jacquiau&lt;ref name="Hamel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Fair_trade_firm_accused_of_foul_play.html?cid=5351232 |title=Fair trade firm accused of foul play I |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=2006-08-03 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Paola Ghillani, who spent four years as president of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations&lt;ref name="Hamel" /&gt; There are many complaints of poor enforcement problems: labourers on Fairtrade farms in Peru are paid less than the minimum wage;&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H. (2006, August 9). 'Fair' coffee workers paid below minimum wage. Financial Times; Weitzman, H. (2006, September 9). ''Ethical-coffee' workers paid below legal minimum. Financial Times.&lt;/ref&gt; some non-Fairtrade coffee is sold as Fairtrade&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H.: 2006, The bitter cost of 'Fair Trade' coffee. Financial Times, September 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 'the standards are not very strict in the case of seasonally hired labour in coffee production.'&lt;ref name="valkila2009" /&gt; 'some fair trade standards are not strictly enforced'&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, G., Gibbon, J., &amp; Slack, R.: 2006, 'The mainstreaming of Fair Trade: a macromarketing perspective', Journal of Strategic Marketing, 14, 329–52.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist found that ten out of ten mills visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported that "The FT was also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received an organic, Fair Trade or other certifications despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref name="ft.com"&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d191adbc-3f4d-11db-a37c-0000779e2340.html | newspaper =FT | place = Americas | title = The bitter cost of 'fair trade' coffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade justice and fair trade ===
Segments of the [[trade justice]] movement have also criticized fair trade in the past years for allegedly focusing too much on individual small producer groups while stopping short of advocating immediate trade policy changes that would have a larger effect on disadvantaged producers' lives. French author and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] correspondent [[Jean-Pierre Boris]] championed this view in his 2005 book ''Commerce inéquitable''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Boris | first = Jean-Pierre | year = 2005 | title = Commerce inéquitable | publisher = Hachette Littératures | place = Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political objections ===
There have been largely political criticisms of fair trade from the left and the right. Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. French author Christian Jacquiau, in his book ''Les coulisses du commerce équitable'', calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e., partnerships with mass retailers, [[multinational corporation]]s, etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous (i.e. [[state monopoly|government monopoly]]) trading system. Jacquiau also supports significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the effect, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms.{{Sfn | Jacquiau | 2006}}{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} It has been argued that the approach of the FairTrade system is too rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice which Southern producers do not participate in setting. "A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Catherine S. Dolan (2008), ''Research in Economic Anthropology'', "Arbitrating risk through moral values: the case of Kenyan fairtrade", volume 28, pp. 271–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flight dynamics''' is the study of the performance, stability, and control of vehicles [[flight|flying]] through the air or in [[outer space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stengel | first = Robert F. | author-link = | title = Aircraft Flight Dynamics (MAE 331) course summary | date = | year = 2010 | url = http://www.princeton.edu/~stengel/MAE331.html | accessdate = November 16, 2011 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with how forces acting on the vehicle influence its speed and attitude with respect to time.

In fixed-wing aircraft, the changing orientation of the vehicle with respect to the local air flow is represented by two critical parameters, angle of attack ("alpha") and angle of sideslip ("beta"). These angles describe the vector direction of airspeed, important because they are the principal source of modulations in the aerodynamic forces and moments applied to the aircraft.

Spacecraft flight dynamics involve three forces: propulsive (rocket engine), gravitational, and lift and drag (when traveling through the earth's or any other atmosphere).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Depending on the vehicle's mass distribution, the effects of gravitational force may also be affected by attitude (and vice versa), but to a much lesser extent.&lt;/ref&gt; Because aerodynamic forces involved with spacecraft flight are very small, this leaves gravity as the dominant force.

Aircraft and spacecraft share a critical interest in their orientation with respect to the earth horizon and heading, and this is represented by another set of angles,&lt;ref name="answersforpilots.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://answersforpilots.com/116/how-aeroplane-change-their-direction|title=Answersforpilots.com|author=|date=|website=answersforpilots.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aircraft principal axes|"yaw", "pitch", and "roll"]], which angles match their colloquial meaning, but also have formal definition as an Euler sequence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Orientation (geometry)#Mathematical representations]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}} These angles are the product of the rotational equations of motion, where orientation responds to torque, just as the velocity of a vehicle responds to forces. For all flight vehicles, these two sets of dynamics, rotational and translational, operate simultaneously and in a coupled fashion to evolve the vehicle's state (orientation and velocity) trajectory.

{{main|Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)}}
{{hatnote|This section focuses on fixed-wing aircraft. For other kinds see [[aircraft]].}}
Flight dynamics is the science of air-vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The critical flight dynamics parameters are the [[angles of rotation]] with respect to the three [[aircraft principal axes|aircraft's principal axes]] about its [[center of mass]], known as ''roll'', ''pitch'' and ''yaw''&lt;ref name="answersforpilots.com"/&gt;

Aircraft engineers develop [[control system]]s for a vehicle's orientation ([[Aircraft attitude|attitude]]) about its [[center of mass]]. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or [[moment (physics)|moment]]s about the center of gravity of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw. For example, a [[pitching moment]] is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the center of gravity of the [[aircraft]], causing the aircraft to pitch up or down.

Roll, pitch and yaw refer, in this context, to rotations about the [[Aircraft principal axes|respective axes]] starting from a defined equilibrium state. The equilibrium roll angle is known as wings level or zero bank angle, equivalent to a level [[Heeling (sailing)|heeling]] angle on a ship. Yaw is known as "heading".

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] increases or decreases the lift generated by the wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the [[angle of attack]] (AOA). The roll angle is also known as bank angle on a fixed-wing aircraft, which usually "banks" to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is usually streamlined from nose to tail to reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]] making it typically advantageous to keep the sideslip angle near zero, though there are instances when an aircraft may be deliberately "sideslipped" for example a [[Slip (aerodynamic)|slip]] in a fixed-wing aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The forces acting on spacecraft are of three types: [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsive]] force (usually provided by the vehicle's engine thrust); [[gravitation]]al force exerted by the Earth and other celestial bodies; and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic lift and drag]] (when flying in the atmosphere of the Earth or another body, such as Mars or Venus). The vehicle's attitude must be taken into account because of its effect on the aerodynamic and propulsive forces.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There are other reasons, unrelated to flight dynamics, for controlling the vehicle's attitude in non-powered flight (e.g., thermal control, solar power generation, communications, or astronomical observation).

The flight dynamics of spacecraft differ from those of aircraft in that the aerodynamic forces are of very small, or vanishingly small effect for most of the vehicle's flight, and cannot be used for attitude control during that time. Also, most of a spacecraft's flight time is usually unpowered, leaving gravity as the dominant force.

[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disk]]]]
&lt;!-- Note: per [[WP:BOLDTITLE]], topic name should ''not'' be bold because the title of this article is descriptive --&gt;
The formation and evolution of the [[Solar System]] began 4.6 [[bya|billion years ago]] with the [[gravitational collapse]] of a small part of a giant [[molecular cloud]].&lt;ref name="Bouvier" /&gt; Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the [[Sun]], while the rest flattened into a [[protoplanetary disk]] out of which the [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|moons]], [[asteroid]]s, and other [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] formed.

This model, known as the [[nebular hypothesis]] was first developed in the 18th century by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[geology]], and [[planetary science]]. Since the dawn of the [[space age]] in the 1950s and the discovery of [[extrasolar planets]] in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.

The Solar System has [[wikt: evolution|evolved]] considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's [[Moon]], may be the result of [[giant impact hypothesis|giant collisions]]. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions.&lt;ref name="Gomes" /&gt; This [[planetary migration]] is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.

In roughly 5&amp;nbsp;billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a [[red giant]]), before casting off its outer layers as a [[planetary nebula]] and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a [[white dwarf]]. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into [[interstellar space]]. Ultimately, over the course of [[Timeline of the far future|tens of billions]] of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.&lt;ref name=dyson /&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of Solar System formation and evolution hypotheses}}
[[File:Pierre-Simon Laplace.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], one of the originators of the nebular hypothesis]]
Ideas concerning the origin and fate of the world date from the earliest known writings; however, for almost all of that time, there was no attempt to link such theories to the existence of a "Solar System", simply because it was not generally thought that the Solar System, in the sense we now understand it, existed. The first step toward a theory of Solar System formation and evolution was the general acceptance of [[heliocentrism]], which placed the Sun at the centre of the system and the [[Earth]] in orbit around it. This concept had developed for millennia ([[Aristarchus of Samos]] had suggested it as early as 250 BC), but was not widely accepted until the end of the 17th century. The first recorded use of the term "Solar System" dates from 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary | title=Solar system | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solar%20system | accessdate=2008-04-15 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current standard [[theory]] for Solar System formation, the [[nebular hypothesis]], has fallen into and out of favour since its formulation by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of [[angular momentum]] when compared to the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Michael Mark Woolfson | author-link=Michael Woolfson | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume=313 | title=Rotation in the Solar System | issue=1524 |year=1984 | pages=5–18 | bibcode=1984RSPTA.313....5W | doi=10.1098/rsta.1984.0078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/solar-system/comets-asteroids/mg13117837.100 | title=Birth of the planets: The Earth and its fellow planets may be survivors from a time when planets ricocheted around the Sun like ball bearings on a pinball table | work=New Scientist | author=Nigel Henbest |year=1991 | accessdate=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding of how the Sun is expected to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]]'s confirmation of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from [[nuclear fusion]] reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Sun: A Biography | author=David Whitehouse | date=2005 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=978-0-470-09297-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars.&lt;ref name=Hoyle2005&gt;{{cite book | title=Fred Hoyle: A Life in Science | author=Simon Mitton | publisher=Aurum|date=2005|chapter=Origin of the Chemical Elements|pages=197–222 | isbn=978-1-85410-961-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Hoyle]] [[B2FH paper|elaborated]] on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called [[red giant]]s [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|created many elements]] heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.&lt;ref name=Hoyle2005/&gt;

===Pre-solar nebula===
The nebular hypothesis says that the Solar System formed from the gravitational collapse of a fragment of a giant [[molecular cloud]].&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006/&gt; The cloud was about 20&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]] (65 light years) across,&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006/&gt; while the fragments were roughly 1&amp;nbsp;parsec (three and a quarter [[light-year]]s) across.&lt;ref name= "Arizona"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecture 13: The Nebular Theory of the origin of the Solar System|url = http://atropos.as.arizona.edu/aiz/teaching/nats102/mario/solar_system.html| author=Ann Zabludoff | accessdate=2006-12-27 | date=Spring 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The further collapse of the fragments led to the formation of dense cores 0.01–0.1&amp;nbsp;[[parsec|pc]] (2,000–20,000&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]]) in size.&lt;ref group=note&gt;An astronomical unit, or AU, is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, or about 150 million kilometres.

The [[Calcium–aluminium-rich inclusion|oldest inclusions found in meteorites]], thought to trace the first solid material to form in the pre-solar nebula, are 4568.2 million years old, which is one definition of the age of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Bouvier"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Audrey Bouvier |author2=Meenakshi Wadhwa | title=The age of the solar system redefined by the oldest Pb-Pb age of a meteoritic inclusion | journal=Nature Geoscience |year=2010 | doi=10.1038/NGEO941 | volume=3 | pages=637–641|bibcode = 2010NatGe...3..637B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as [[iron-60]], that only form in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more [[supernova]]e occurred near the Sun while it was forming. A [[shock wave]] from a supernova may have triggered the formation of the Sun by creating relatively dense regions within the cloud, causing these regions to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Williams | first1 = J.| title = The astrophysical environment of the solar birthplace| journal = Contemporary Physics| volume = 51| issue = 5| pages = 381–396| year = 2010| doi = 10.1080/00107511003764725|bibcode = 2010ConPh..51..381W |arxiv = 1008.2973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because only massive, short-lived stars produce supernovae, the Sun must have formed in a large star-forming region that produced massive stars, possibly similar to the [[Orion Nebula]].&lt;ref name=cradle&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J.

Because of the [[conservation of angular momentum]], the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their [[kinetic energy]] into [[heat]].

The various planets are thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the disc-shaped cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chondrule-forming Shock Fronts in the Solar Nebula: A Possible Unified Scenario for Planet and Chondrite Formation|author1=A.

Through direct contact, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 metres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies ([[planetesimals]]) of ~10&amp;nbsp;kilometres (km) in size.&lt;ref name=Goldreich1973/&gt; These gradually increased through further collisions, growing at the rate of centimetres per year over the course of the next few million years.&lt;ref name=Goldreich1973&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P.

The [[inner Solar System]], the region of the Solar System inside 4&amp;nbsp;AU, was too warm for volatile molecules like water and methane to condense, so the planetesimals that formed there could only form from compounds with high melting points, such as metals (like [[iron]], [[nickel]], and [[aluminium]]) and rocky [[silicate]]s. These rocky bodies would become the [[terrestrial planet]]s ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]). These compounds are quite rare in the Universe, comprising only 0.6% of the mass of the nebula, so the terrestrial planets could not grow very large.&lt;ref name=Arizona /&gt; The terrestrial embryos grew to about 0.05 [[Earth mass]]es ({{Earth mass}}) and ceased accumulating matter about 100,000&amp;nbsp;years after the formation of the Sun; subsequent collisions and mergers between these planet-sized bodies allowed terrestrial planets to grow to their present sizes (see [[#Terrestrial planets|Terrestrial planets]] below).&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt;

When the terrestrial planets were forming, they remained immersed in a disk of gas and dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as the planets. The resulting [[drag (physics)|drag]] and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of [[angular momentum]], and as a result the planets gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration,&lt;ref name=dangelo_lubow_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Angelo|first=G.|author2=Lubow, S.

The [[giant planet]]s ([[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) formed further out, beyond the [[frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], which is the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant]] elements.&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt; Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to {{Earth mass|4|link=y}} within about 3&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The combined mass of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune is 445.6 Earth masses. The mass of remaining material is ~5.26 Earth masses or 1.1% (see [[Solar System#Notes]] and [[List of Solar System objects by mass]])&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists believe it is no accident that Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line. Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~5&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun. This excess material coalesced into a large embryo (or core) on the order of {{Earth mass|10}}, which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate.&lt;ref name=ayliffe_bate_2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayliffe|first=B.|author2= Bate, M.

T Tauri stars like the young Sun have far stronger [[stellar wind]]s than more stable, older stars. Uranus and Neptune are thought to have formed after Jupiter and Saturn did, when the strong [[solar wind]] had blown away much of the disc material. As a result, those planets accumulated little hydrogen and helium—not more than {{Earth mass|1}} each. Uranus and Neptune are sometimes referred to as failed cores.&lt;ref name="thommes" /&gt; The main problem with formation theories for these planets is the timescale of their formation. At the current locations it would have taken millions of years for their cores to accrete.&lt;ref name="ddl2011" /&gt;  This means that Uranus and Neptune  may have formed closer to the Sun—near or even between Jupiter and Saturn—and later migrated or were ejected outward (see [[#Planetary migration|Planetary migration]] below).&lt;ref name="thommes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; Motion in the planetesimal era was not all inward toward the Sun; the ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' sample return from [[Comet Wild 2]] has suggested that materials from the early formation of the Solar System migrated from the warmer inner Solar System to the region of the Kuiper belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2006|author=Emily Lakdawalla|work=The Planetary Society|title=Stardust Results in a Nutshell: The Solar Nebula was Like a Blender | url = http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000735/| accessdate=2007-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After between three and ten&amp;nbsp;million years,&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt; the young Sun's solar wind would have cleared away all the gas and dust in the protoplanetary disc, blowing it into interstellar space, thus ending the growth of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=B.

==Subsequent evolution==
The planets were originally thought to have formed in or near their current orbits. From that a minimum mass of the nebula i.e. the protoplanetary disc, was derived that was necessary to form the planets - the minimum mass solar nebula. It was derived that the nebula mass must have exceeded 3585 times that of the Earth.

However, this has been questioned during the last 20 years. Currently, many planetary scientists think that the Solar System might have looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact than it is now, and the [[Kuiper belt]] was much closer to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] |url = http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/moon/index.html |title=Dysnomia, the moon of Eris |work=Personal web site|accessdate=2008-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrestrial planets===
At the end of the planetary formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized [[planetary embryo]]s.&lt;ref name="Petit2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kominami"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Tidal Interaction with a Gas Disk on Formation of Terrestrial Planets|author1=Junko Kominami |author2=Shigeru Ida |place=Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo|year=2001 | doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6811|journal=Icarus|
volume=157|issue=1|pages=43–56|bibcode=2002Icar..157...43K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100&amp;nbsp;million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see [[#Moons|Moons]] below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref name=Solomon2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sean C. Solomon|title=Mercury: the enigmatic innermost planet|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=216|issue=4|year=2003|pages=441–455|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(03)00546-6| bibcode=2003E&amp;PSL.216..441S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One unresolved issue with this model is that it cannot explain how the initial orbits of the proto-terrestrial planets, which would have needed to be highly eccentric to collide, produced the remarkably stable and nearly circular orbits they have today.&lt;ref name="Petit2001" /&gt; One hypothesis for this "eccentricity dumping" is that the terrestrials formed in a disc of gas still not expelled by the Sun. The "[[gravitational drag]]" of this residual gas would have eventually lowered the planets' energy, smoothing out their orbits.&lt;ref name= Kominami /&gt; However, such gas, if it existed, would have prevented the terrestrial planets' orbits from becoming so eccentric in the first place.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; Another hypothesis is that gravitational drag occurred not between the planets and residual gas but between the planets and the remaining small bodies. As the large bodies moved through the crowd of smaller objects, the smaller objects, attracted by the larger planets' gravity, formed a region of higher density, a "gravitational wake", in the larger objects' path. As they did so, the increased gravity of the wake slowed the larger objects down into more regular orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Final Stages of Planet Formation|author1=Peter Goldreich |author2=Yoram Lithwick |author3=Re'em Sari |journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=614|issue=1|pages=497–507|date=10 October 2004|doi=10.1086/423612|bibcode=2004ApJ...614..497G|arxiv = astro-ph/0404240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asteroid belt===
The outer edge of the terrestrial region, between 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun, is called the [[asteroid belt]]. The asteroid belt initially contained more than enough matter to form 2–3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of [[planetesimal]]s formed there. As with the terrestrials, planetesimals in this region later coalesced and formed 20–30 Moon- to Mars-sized [[planetary embryo]]s;&lt;ref name="Bottke2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bottke, William F. |author2=Durda, Daniel D. |author3=Nesvorny, David |display-authors=et al. | title=Linking the collisional history of the main asteroid belt to its dynamical excitation and depletion | journal=Icarus | volume=179|issue=1 | pages=63–94|year=2005 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.017 | url = http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/Bottke_Icarus_2005_179_63-94_Linking_Collision_Dynamics_MB.pdf|format=PDF | bibcode=2005Icar..179...63B }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the proximity of Jupiter meant that after this planet formed, 3&amp;nbsp;million years after the Sun, the region's history changed dramatically.&lt;ref name="Petit2001"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jean-Marc |last=Petit |first2=Alessandro |last2=Morbidelli |title=The Primordial Excitation and Clearing of the Asteroid Belt |journal=Icarus |volume=153 |issue=2 |pages=338–347 |year=2001 |doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6702 |url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge133/reading/asteroids.pdf |format=PDF |bibcode=2001Icar..153..338P }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orbital resonance]]s with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in the asteroid belt, and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those resonances.

According to the nebular hypothesis, the outer two planets may be in the "wrong place".

According to the [[Nice model]], after the formation of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500–600&amp;nbsp;million years (about 4&amp;nbsp;billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2:1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt.&lt;ref name="Tsiganis05" /&gt;
The planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reason that Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all moved outward whereas Jupiter moved inward is that Jupiter is massive enough to eject planetesimals from the Solar System, while the other three outer planets are not. To eject an object from the Solar System, Jupiter transfers energy to it, and so loses some of its own orbital energy and moves inwards. When Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb planetesimals outwards, those planetesimals end up in highly eccentric but still bound orbits, and so can return to the perturbing planet and possibly return its lost energy. On the other hand, when Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb objects inwards, those planets gain energy by doing so and therefore move outwards. More importantly, an object being perturbed inwards stands a greater chance of encountering Jupiter and being [[Interstellar comet|ejected]] from the Solar System, in which case the energy gains of Neptune, Uranus and Saturn obtained from their inwards deflections of the ejected object become permanent.&lt;/ref&gt; Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud;&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including [[Pluto]], became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into [[mean-motion resonance]]s.&lt;ref name=Malhorta1995&gt;{{cite journal | author=R. Malhotra | title=The Origin of Pluto's Orbit: Implications for the Solar System Beyond Neptune | journal=Astronomical Journal | arxiv=astro-ph/9504036 |year=1995 | volume=110 | pages=420 | doi=10.1086/117532 | bibcode=1995AJ....110..420M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fogg_nelson"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M.

In contrast to the outer planets, the inner planets are not thought to have migrated significantly over the age of the Solar System, because their orbits have remained stable following the period of giant impacts.&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt;

Another question is why Mars came out so small compared with Earth. A study by Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, published June 6, 2011 (called the [[Grand tack hypothesis]]), proposes that Jupiter had migrated inward to 1.5&amp;nbsp;AU. After Saturn formed, migrated inward, and established the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, the study assumes that both planets migrated back to their present positions. Jupiter thus would have consumed much of the material that would have created a bigger Mars. The same simulations also reproduce the characteristics of the modern asteroid belt, with dry asteroids and water-rich objects similar to comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.astronomy.com/News-Observing/News/2011/06/Jupiter%20may%20have%20robbed%20Mars%20of%20mass%20new%20report%20indicates.aspx | title= Jupiter may have robbed Mars of mass, new report indicates | work= Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas | date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Walsh, K.

Over the course of the Solar System's evolution, [[comet]]s were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent thousands of AU outward to form the [[Oort cloud]], a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by [[galactic tide]]s, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the inner Solar System.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli2006"&gt;{{cite arXiv

[[File:Artist's concept of collision at HD 172555.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of the [[Giant impact hypothesis|giant impact]] thought to have formed the [[Moon]]]]
Moons have come to exist around most planets and many other Solar System bodies. These [[natural satellite]]s originated by one of three possible mechanisms:
* Co-formation from a circumplanetary disc (only in the cases of the giant planets);
* Formation from impact debris (given a large enough impact at a shallow angle); and
* Capture of a passing object.

Jupiter and Saturn have several large moons, such as [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which may have originated from discs around each giant planet in much the same way that the planets formed from the disc around the Sun.&lt;ref name="arxiv0812"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Canup, Robin M. |author2=Ward, William R. |title=Origin of Europa and the Galilean Satellites |publisher=University of Arizona Press |date=2008-12-30 |arxiv=0812.4995|bibcode = 2009euro.book...59C |page=59|isbn=978-0-8165-2844-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dangelo_podolak_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Angelo|first=G.|author2= Podolak, M.|title=Capture and Evolution of Planetesimals in Circumjovian Disks|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2015|volume=806|issue=1|pages=29pp|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/806/2/203|arxiv = 1504.04364 |bibcode = 2015ApJ...806..203D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=N.

==Future==
Astronomers estimate that the Solar System as we know it today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning [[stellar evolution|its evolution]] from the [[main sequence]] of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] and into its [[red giant|red-giant]] phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.

===Long-term stability===
The Solar System is [[chaos theory|chaotic]] over million- and billion-year timescales,&lt;ref name=laskar94&gt;{{cite journal

|year=1994
|bibcode=1994A&amp;A...287L...9L }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the orbits of the planets open to long-term variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 [[orbital resonance]]. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto with any degree of accuracy more than 10–20&amp;nbsp;million years (the [[Lyapunov time]]) into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Numerical evidence that the motion of Pluto is chaotic |author1=Gerald Jay Sussman |author2=Jack Wisdom | journal = Science | volume = 241 | pages = 433–437 |year = 1988 | url = http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/wisdom/pluto-chaos.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.241.4864.433 | pmid = 17792606 | issue = 4864 | bibcode=1988Sci...241..433S
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is Earth's [[axial tilt]], which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon ([[#Moon–ring systems|see below]]), is incomputable from some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the long term evolution of the spin of the Earth|author=O.

The outer planets' orbits are chaotic over longer timescales, with a Lyapunov time in the range of 2–230&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=hayes07&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wayne B. Hayes | title=Is the outer Solar System chaotic? | journal=Nature Physics | arxiv=astro-ph/0702179 |year=2007 | volume=3 | issue=10 | pages=689–691 | doi=10.1038/nphys728 | bibcode=2007NatPh...3..689H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In all cases this means that the position of a planet along its orbit ultimately becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer become uncertain), but in some cases the orbits themselves may change dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], with some planets' orbits becoming significantly more—or less—[[ellipse|elliptical]].&lt;ref name="Stewart1997"&gt;{{cite book

Ultimately, the Solar System is stable in that none of the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years.&lt;ref name=hayes07/&gt; Beyond this, within five&amp;nbsp;billion years or so Mars's eccentricity may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision.

===Moon–ring systems===
The evolution of moon systems is driven by [[tide|tidal forces]]. A moon will raise a [[tidal bulge]] in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving in the same direction as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, [[angular momentum]] is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the revolution of the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.

The Earth and its Moon are one example of this configuration. Today, the Moon is [[tidally locked]] to the Earth; one of its revolutions around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually. Other examples are the [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]] (as well as many of Jupiter's smaller moons)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1982MNRAS.201..415G | title=Tidal Heating of Io and orbital evolution of the Jovian satellites | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | author=A. Gailitis | volume=201 | pages=415 |year=1980 | doi = 10.1093/mnras/201.2.415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of the larger moons of [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Bevilacqua |author2=O.

[[File:Voyager 2 Neptune and Triton.jpg|thumb|Neptune and its moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], taken by ''[[Voyager 2]]''. Triton's orbit will eventually take it within Neptune's [[Roche limit]], tearing it apart and possibly forming a new ring system.]]
A different scenario occurs when the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so the rotation of the primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out).&lt;ref group=note&gt;In all of these cases of transfer of angular momentum and energy, the angular momentum of the two-body system is conserved. In contrast, the summed energy of the moon's revolution plus the primary's rotation is not conserved, but decreases over time, due to dissipation via frictional heat generated by the movement of the tidal bulge through the body of the primary. If the primary were a frictionless ideal fluid, the tidal bulge would be centered under the satellite, and no transfer would take place.

A third possibility is where the primary and moon are [[tidally locked]] to each other. In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no transfer of angular momentum, and the orbital period will not change. Pluto and Charon are an example of this type of configuration.&lt;ref&gt;

Prior to the 2004 arrival of the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' spacecraft, the [[rings of Saturn]] were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not expected to survive beyond another 300&amp;nbsp;million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saturn Rings Still A Mystery |work=Popular Mechanics |author=Stefano Coledan |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/1285531.html |year=2002 |accessdate=2007-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015710/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/1285531.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, data from the ''Cassini'' mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10&amp;nbsp;km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass is thought to have preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Saturn's recycled rings | journal=Astronomy Now| pages=9 |date=February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long term, the greatest changes in the Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages.

Gradually, the hydrogen burning in the shell around the solar core will increase the mass of the core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into [[carbon]] will begin, leading to a [[helium flash]]; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11&amp;nbsp;times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770&amp;nbsp;K. The Sun will become a [[Horizontal branch|horizontal giant]], burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100&amp;nbsp;million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic giant]].

The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.&lt;ref name=nebula&gt;{{cite web | author=Bruce Balick | title=Planetary nebulae and the future of the Solar System | work=Personal web site | url = http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/| accessdate=2006-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a relatively peaceful event, nothing akin to a [[supernova]], which the Sun is too small to undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely.

As the Sun dies, its gravitational pull on the orbiting bodies such as planets, comets and asteroids will weaken due to its mass loss.

==Galactic interaction==
[[File:Milky Way Spiral Arm.svg|left|thumb|Location of the Solar System within the Milky Way]]
The Solar System travels alone through the [[Milky Way]] in a circular orbit approximately 30,000&amp;nbsp;light years from the [[Galactic Centre]]. Its speed is about 220&amp;nbsp;km/s. The period required for the Solar System to complete one revolution around the Galactic Centre, the [[galactic year]], is in the range of 220–250 million years. Since its formation, the Solar System has completed at least 20 such revolutions.&lt;ref name="biblio"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/StacyLeong.shtml|work=The Physics Factbook (self-published)| author=Stacy Leong| editor=Glenn Elert |year=2002|title=Period of the Sun's Orbit around the Galaxy (Cosmic Year) | accessdate=2008-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scientists have speculated that the Solar System's path through the galaxy is a factor in the periodicity of [[mass extinction]]s observed in the Earth's [[fossil record]]. One hypothesis supposes that vertical oscillations made by the Sun as it orbits the Galactic Centre cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic disc, the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker; as it re-enters the galactic disc, as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years, it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the Solar System by a factor of 4, leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, others argue that the Sun is currently close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's [[spiral arms]]. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright [[blue giant]]s, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as [[supernovae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mass Extinctions and The Sun's Encounters with Spiral Arms|author1=Erik M.

===Galactic collision and planetary disruption===
{{Main article|Andromeda–Milky Way collision}}
Although the vast majority of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; In 4&amp;nbsp;billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as [[tidal force]]s distort their outer arms into vast [[tidal tails]]. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become [[gravity|gravitationally]] bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy.&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%,&lt;ref name=cox /&gt; the galaxies' [[supermassive black hole]]s will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6&amp;nbsp;billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant [[elliptical galaxy]]. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a [[Starburst galaxy|starburst]].&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an [[active galactic nucleus]]. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.&lt;ref name=cain&gt;{{cite web|title=When Our Galaxy Smashes Into Andromeda, What Happens to the Sun?|author=Fraser Cain|work=Universe Today|url = http://www.universetoday.com/2007/05/10/when-our-galaxy-smashes-into-andromeda-what-happens-to-the-sun/|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cox&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Collision Between The Milky Way And Andromeda |author1=J. T.

It is a common misconception that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although it is true that the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/milky-way-collide.html |author=NASA|title=NASA's Hubble Shows Milky Way is Destined for Head-On Collision |work=NASA |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, over time, the [[Cumulative distribution function|cumulative probability]] of a chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the [[Big Crunch]] or [[Big Rip]] scenarios for the end of the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1&amp;nbsp;quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.&lt;ref name=dyson&gt;{{cite journal|title=Time Without End: Physics and Biology in an open universe|author=Freeman Dyson|place=Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton New Jersey|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=51 | pages=447–460|date=July 1979 | url = http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447 |accessdate=2008-04-02 | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447|issue=3 | bibcode=1979RvMP...51..447D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
{{wide image|Solar Life Cycle.svg|600px|alt=Projected timeline of the Sun's life. From Formation To 14Gy}}
The time frame of the Solar System's formation has been determined using [[radiometric dating]]. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years old. The [[oldest rock|oldest known mineral grains]] on [[Earth]] are approximately 4.4&amp;nbsp;billion years old.&lt;ref name=Wilde&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nature | volume=409 | pages=175–8 | title= Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4 Gyr ago |author1=Simon A.

To estimate the age of the Solar System, scientists use [[meteorite]]s, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. Almost all meteorites (see the [[Canyon Diablo meteorite]]) are found to have an age of 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years, suggesting that the Solar System must be at least this old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | date=2000 |author=Gary Ernst Wallace|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter=Earth's Place in the Solar System|title=Earth Systems: Processes and Issues|pages=45–58|isbn=0-521-47895-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of discs around other stars have also done much to establish a time frame for Solar System formation. Stars between one and three million years old have discs rich in gas, whereas discs around stars more than 10&amp;nbsp;million years old have little to no gas, suggesting that giant planets within them have ceased forming.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5614">The '''German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research''' (German: ''Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sozialwissenschaftliche Sexualforschung'', '''DGSS''') is a [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] research and counselling organization (cf. [[sexology]]) based in [[Düsseldorf]]. It is primarily devoted to sociological, behavioral, and cultural sexuality research. It was founded in 1971 by German sexologist [[Rolf Gindorf]] and colleagues. 

The DGSS is the oldest non-medical sexological society existing in German-language [[Europe]] (i. e., [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], and parts of [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], and [[Italy]]). Its governing and international advisory boards have included many noted scholars, among them Rüdiger Lautmann, [[John Money]], [[Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg]], John Gagnon, [[Igor Kon|Igor S. Kon]] [http://www.neuro.net.ru/sexology/english/], [[Liu Dalin]], and Martin S. Weinberg [http://www.indiana.edu/~soc/zbio_Weinberg.shtml]. Presidents were [[Rolf Gindorf]] (1971-1979, Vice Pres. -2004, now Hon. Pres.), Helmut Kentler (1979-1982), [[Ernest Borneman]] (1982-1986, now Hon. Pres.), [[Erwin J. Haeberle]] (1986-2002), Gunter Runkel (2002-2006) [http://www.sexologie.org/runkel.htm], and [[Jakob Pastoetter]] [http://www.sexologie.org/topf/jmp.htm] (2006-).
 
From the very beginning, the DGSS has emphasized the importance of the social, behavioral, and cultural sciences for an adequate understanding of the human sexualities in their many forms, facets, and variations. In addition to traditional sexological fields like [[biology]], [[physiology]], and [[medicine]], the DGSS focus has centered on the [[social sciences]], [[psychology]], and [[ethnology]], embracing also educational, legal, and historical aspects. In 1978, the DGSS added a pioneering [[psychotherapy|counselling]] institute ("DGSS-Institut") to its scientific and research activities. Since then, more than 33,000 clients received sexual counselling or [[psychotherapy]]. [[Gay]], [[lesbian]] and [[bisexual]] people form a considerable group. [[AIDS]] counseling and [[HIV]] antibody testing has been provided since 1983.
 
Under difficult circumstances, with habitually low financial resources and extremely modest outside support, the DGSS has nevertheless managed to hold increasingly successful national and international sexological congresses, establishing a close cooperation with most German and many foreign sexological societies. An impressive number of scientific publications, including many books and a book series ("Schriftenreihe Sozialwissenschaftliche Sexualforschung", Berlin/New York: W. de Gruyter, since 1986; Münster/Hamburg/London: LIT Verlag, since 2003) give a fairly adequate impression of sexological research by the DGSS and its members. 

Since 1990, the DGSS has been awarding its [[Magnus Hirschfeld Medal]]s for [[Sexual Science]] and for [[Sexual Reform]]. Recipients so far were [[Ernest Borneman]] (Austria), [[John P. DeCecco]] (U.S.A.), [[Liu Dalin]] (China), [[Jonathan Ned Katz]] (U.S.A), [[Milton Diamond]] (U.S.A), [[John Money]] (U.S.A), [[Martin S. Weinberg]] (U.S.A.), [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]] (U.S.A/UK) and [[Hu Peicheng]] (China) for Sexual Science ([[Sexology]]); [[Herman Musaph]] (The Netherlands), [[Imre Aszódi]] (Hungary), [[Ruth Westheimer]] (U.S.A.), [[Maj-Briht Bergström-Walan]] (Sweden), [[Oswalt Kolle]] (The Netherlands), [[Manfred Bruns]] (Germany), [[William Granzig]] (U.S.A), [[Rolf Gindorf]], [[Rita Süssmuth]] (Germany) and [[Robert T. Francoeur]] (U.S.A.) for [[Sexual Reform]].
 
Once the Berlin wall had fallen, the DGSS was able to move its congresses to the original birthplace of sexology, and to resume the tradition of the Berlin sexological conferences started in 1921 by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. From July 25–27, 1997, the XIII. DGSS Congress of Social Scientific Sex Research, being at the same time the VI. International Berlin Conference for Sexology), took place at Berlin's old [[Humboldt University]]. Its theme: "100 Years of [[Gay Liberation]]". Scientists (most of them gay) came from many countries in Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia. From June 29 through July 2, 2000, the XIV. DGSS Congress was held in conjunction with the V. Conference of the [[European Federation of Sexology]] (EFS) in Berlin's "House of World Cultures", hosting some 270 delegates from 34 countries. Its theme: "For A Millennium of Sexual Health". In 2002, the XVth DGSS Conference from June 21–23 was moved, following the DGSS  president-elect Gunter Runkel, to the romantic, historic town of [[Lüneburg]] (near [[Hamburg]]) and its modern university. Its general theme: "Sexualities in the Third Millennium - Recent Developments in Sexuality Research". Again, sexologists from many nations attended, colleagues from the United States forming the largest contingent. In 2004, the XVI. DGSS Conference on "Sexualities and Social Change" was likewise held in Lüneburg, where the XVII. Conference ("Sexuality and Love") also took place on Sept. 22-24, 2006. The XVIIIth DGSS Conference ("Sexuality and the Media") will take place in Munich from Nov. 7-9, 2008, again with many Americans scheduled to attend.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3052">[[File:Hagenhufendorf.jpg|right|thumb|Plan of a ''Hagenhufendorf'']]
A '''''Hagenhufendorf''''' (German: also ''Bachhufendorf'', ''Hagenhufensiedlung'' or ''Hägerhufensiedlung'') is an elongated settlement, similar to a ''[[Reihendorf]]'', laid out along a road running parallel to a stream, whereby only one side of the road has houses, whilst on the opposite side are the [[hide (unit)|hides]] (''Hufen''), the handkerchief-shaped farmer's fields of medieval origin, about 20 to 40 [[morgen]]s in area. 

== Name ==
This German term is probably derived from ''Hagenrecht'' ("hedging right"), i.e. the owner had a right to enclose the land he used. This went even further for the ''Hägerhufensiedlungen'', where there was a ''Hägerjunker'' in charge and special courts dealing with enclosure issues, the ''Hägergerichte''.

== Description ==
The ''Hagenhufensiedlung'' was a form of planned settlement typical of the [[High Middle Ages]] that consisted of individually owned strips of land that were strung together in a line. The hides were as wide as the farmstead, but could be several hundred metres long. 

The enclosed plots were used as vegetable gardens and for keeping small animals. The stream at the back of the farmhouses supplied the necessary water. From this type of settlement, long linear villages developed like [[Auhagen]], [[Wiedensahl]], [[Isernhagen]], [[Auetal|Kathrinhagen]] or [[Rodewald]] in Lower Saxony. ''Hagenhufensiedlungen'' may be found from the [[Taunus]] region as far as [[Western Pomerania]]. The ''Hägerhufensiedlung'' is restricted to a region in the area of the [[Weser Uplands]], [[Leine Uplands]] and [[Kreis Lippe|Lippe]]. 

== Origin ==
The ''Hagenhufendörfer'' arose from the planned settlement of forested areas, predominantly in the 13th century, with the aim of clearing and cultivating the land. These villages had a [[lokator]] with a double hide (''Doppelhufe'').
The ''Hägerhufensiedlungen'' go back to the 11th-century [[Eschershausen#History|Eschershausen]] Treaty. Although they had no double hide and no lokator, they did have special enclosure rights (''Hägerrecht'').

== Extent ==
''Hagenhufendörfer'' are especially common in the [[Börde]] regions, on the [[North German Plain]] immediately north of the German [[Central Uplands]]. The best-known region, with many such villages, is the area around [[Stadthagen]], which was itself founded as a planned town in the centre of the plain that was to be settled, between the [[Schaumburg Forest]] and [[Bückeberge|Bückebergen]]. The ''Hägerhufensiedlungen'' of the fertile plain can no longer be made out in the countryside.

'''Herbchronology''' is the analysis of annual [[growth rings]] (or simply annual rings) in the secondary root [[xylem]] of [[perennial]] [[herbaceous plants]]. While leaves and stems of perennial herbs die down at the end of the growing season the root often persists for many years or even the entire life.&lt;ref name="JBRCDB2002"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dietz H, Schweingruber FH |title=Annual rings in native and introduced forbs of lower Michigan, USA
 |journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|volume=80|year=2002|pages=642–649|doi=10.1139/b02-048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perennial herb species belonging to the [[dicotyledon]] group (also known as perennial [[forbs]]) are characterized by [[secondary growth]], which shows as a new [[growth ring]] added each year to persistent roots. About two thirds of all perennial dicotyledonous herb species with a persistent root that grow in the strongly seasonal zone of the northern hemisphere show at least fairly clear annual  growth rings.&lt;ref name="JBRCDB2002" /&gt;

Counting of annual growth rings can be used to determine the age of a perennial herb similarly as it is done in trees using [[dendrochronology]].&lt;ref name="PB2006"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=von Arx G, Dietz H |title=Growth rings in the roots of temperate forbs are robust annual markers|journal=Plant Biology|volume=8|year=2006|pages=224–233|doi=10.1055/s-2005-873051}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way it was found that some perennial herbs live up to 50 years and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Growth rings in herbs and shrubs: life span, age determination and stem anatomy|vauthors=Schweingruber FH, Poschlod P |pages=195–415|year=2005|issn=1424-5108|publisher=Haupt|location=Bern}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECO2006"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=von Arx G, Edwards PJ, Dietz H |title=Evidence for life history changes in high altitude populations of three perennial forbs|journal=Ecology|volume=87|year=2006|pages=665–674|doi=10.1890/05-1041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term herb-chronology is referring to [[dendrochronology]] because of the similarity of the structures investigated. The term was introduced in the late 1990s,&lt;ref name="AB1998"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dietz H, Ullmann I |title=Ecological application of 'Herbchronology': Comparative stand age structure analyses of the invasive plant Bunias orientalis L.|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=82|year=1998|pages=471–480|doi=10.1006/anbo.1998.0706}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the existence of annual rings in perennial herbs was already observed in earlier times by several researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Petersen HE|title=Diapensiaceae|journal=Meddelelser am Gronland|volume=36|year=1908|pages=141–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zoller H|title=Beitrag zur Altersbestimmung von Pflanzen aus der Walliser Felsensteppe|journal=Bericht über das Geobotanische Forschungsinstitut Rübel in Zürich|year=1949|pages=61–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bakshi TS, Coupland RT |title=Vegetative propagation in Linaria vulgaris|journal=Journal of Botany|volume=38|year=1960|pages=243–249|doi=10.1139/b60-022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual growth rings==
Like trees and woody plants, perennial herbs have a growth zone called [[vascular cambium]] between the root bark and the root [[xylem]]. The [[vascular cambium ring]] is active during growing season and produces a new layer of [[xylem]] tissue or growth ring every year. This addition of a new lateral layer each year is called [[secondary growth]] and is exactly the same as in woody plants. Each individual growth ring consists of [[Wood#Earlywood and latewood in softwood|earlywood]] tissue that is formed at the beginning of the growing season and [[Wood#Earlywood and latewood in softwood|latewood]] tissue formed in summer and fall. Earlywood tissue is characterized by wide [[vessel element|vessels]] or denser arrangement of vessels, whereas latewood tissue shows narrower vessels and/or lower vessel density.&lt;ref name="JBRCDB2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PB2006" /&gt;

Annual growth rings in herbs are usually only visible by means of a microscope and a specific staining method. Ring-like patterns visible in roots cross sections by the naked eye may be false rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Werner PA|title=On the determination of age in Liatris aspera using cross-sections of corms: implications for past demographic studies|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=112|year=1978|pages=1113–1120|doi=10.1086/283350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The width of annual growth rings depends on conditions during formation; in a favorable year it is wider and in a less favorable year narrower.&lt;ref name="ECO2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dietz H, von Arx G |title=Climatic fluctuation causes large-scale synchronous variation in radial increments of the main roots of northern hemisphere forbs|journal=Ecology|volume=86|year=2005|pages=327–333|doi=10.1890/04-0801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Herbchronology is used in many fields of ecological and biological research, for instance in  [[community ecology]], [[population biology]], [[plant ecology]] and [[Invasion biology terminology|invasion biology]].

Herbchronology is used as a tool to estimate plant age. This may be relevant information to determine :
*… the longevity of a perennial [[herbaceous plant]] species; this is valuable information for flora books and an important aspect of life history strategy of a species.&lt;ref name="ECO2006"/&gt;
*… the population age structure; this is valuable for questions into population dynamics or the spreading patterns of invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dietz H|title=Plant invasion patches - reconstructing pattern and process by means of herb-chronology|journal=Biological Invasions|volume=4|year=2002|pages=211–222|doi=10.1023/a:1020971509871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Moloney KA, Knaus F, Dietz H |title=Evidence for a shift in life-history strategy during the secondary phase of a plant invasion|journal=Biological Invasions|volume=11|year=2009|pages=625–634|doi=10.1007/s10530-008-9277-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbchronology allows to assess long-term annual growth rates of a perennial [[herbaceous plant]] without having to monitor it. This may be relevant information to assess …
*… the impact of fluctuations in specific climatic conditions on growth.&lt;ref name="ECO2005" /&gt;
*… the impact of changes in site conditions such as competition.&lt;ref name="AB1998" /&gt;
*… lifetime growth patterns.&lt;ref name="ECO2006" /&gt;

In philosophy and theology, '''infinity''' is explored in articles under headings such as [[the Ultimate (philosophy)|the Ultimate]], the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], [[God]], and [[Zeno's paradoxes]]. In [[Greek philosophy]], for example in [[Anaximander]], 'the Boundless' is the origin of all that is. He took the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (ἄπειρον, ''apeiron''). The [[Jainism|Jain]] metaphysics and mathematics was the first to define and delineate different "types" of infinities. The work of the mathematician [[Georg Cantor]] first placed infinity into a coherent mathematical framework. Keenly aware of his departure from traditional wisdom, Cantor also presented a comprehensive historical and philosophical discussion of infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newstead|first=A.|title=Cantor on Infinity in Nature, Number, and the Divine Mind|journal=American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly|publication-date=2009|volume=83|issue=4|page=|pages=533–553.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Judeo-Christian]] theology, for example in the work of [[Duns Scotus]], the infinite nature of God invokes a sense of being without constraint, rather than a sense of being unlimited in quantity. In [[ethics]] infinity plays an important role designating that which cannot be defined or reduced to knowledge or power.

==Early thinking==
===Egyptian===
''Main: [[Heh (god)|Ḥeḥu and Ḥeḥut]]'' - [[Heinrich Karl Brugsch|(Brugsch 1885)]]

{{quote|...how sad is the descent in the land of silence, the wakeful sleeps, he who did not slumber at night lies still forever. The scorners say: The dwelling place of the inhabitants of the West is deep and dark, it has no door, no window, no light to illuminate it, no north wind to refresh the heart, the sun does not rise there, but they lie every day in darkness - the guardian has been taken away to the land of infinity...|an Egyptian mourner &lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Frankfort]] citing ''Kees, Zeitschrift für aegyptische Sprache'' in  - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jy_DAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg Ancient Egyptian Religion: An Interpretation], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jy_DAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Infinity+in+Ancient+Egyptian+thought&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQnJPPgNzTAhUKVxoKHfiDDUsQ6AEIRTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Infinity%20in%20Ancient%20Egyptian%20thought&amp;f=false p.108], [[Courier Corporation]], 22 June 2012, {{ISBN|048614495X}} Consulted 2017-06-May&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Greek===
====Anaximander====

An early engagement with the idea of infinity was made by [[Anaximander]] who considered infinity to be a foundational and primitive basis of reality.&lt;ref name="F. LeRon Shults"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4o4Rgh8RWMC&amp;pg=PA99|author=F. LeRon Shults|title=Reforming the Doctrine of God (footnote 4. of page 99)|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1 Nov 2005, 326 pages, {{ISBN|0802829880}}|accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anaximander was the first in the Greek philosophical tradition to propose that the universe was infinite.&lt;ref name="A.A.Long  "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4m2GP9eJmIC&amp;pg=PA127 |author=A.A.

====Anaxagoras====

[[Anaxagoras]] (500–428 BCE) was of the opinion that matter of the universe had an innate capacity for infinite division.&lt;ref name="  James Fieser "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/class/110/1-presocratics.htm |author= James Fieser |title=The History of Philosophy: A Short Survey |publisher=The University of Tennessee at Martin |date=2008 |isbn= |page=|accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Atomists====

A group of thinkers of ancient Greece (later identified as [[Atomism|the Atomists]]) all similarly considered matter to be made of an infinite number of structures as considered by imagining an dividing or separating matter from itself an infinite number of times.&lt;ref name=" J J O'Connor and E F Robertson "&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Infinity.html |author=J.J. O'Connor, E.F. Robertson |title=Infinity |publisher=School of Computer Science - University of St Andrews|date=February 2002 |isbn= |page=|accessdate=2016-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aristotle and after====

Aristotle, alive for the period 384–322 BCE, is credited with being the root of a field of thought, in his influence of succeeding thinking for a period spanning more than one subsequent millennium, by his rejection of the idea of [[actual infinity]].&lt;ref name=" Rudy Rucker "&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/infinity-mathematics |author=Rudy Rucker |title=Infinity: Mathematics |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |isbn= |page=|accessdate=2016-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book 3 of the work entitled [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]], written by [[Aristotle]], Aristotle deals with the [[concept]] of infinity in terms of his notion of [[actuality]] and of [[potentiality]].&lt;ref name="[[Wolfgang Achtner]]"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVNbIGS37wMC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Aristotle+Infinity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gT2HVdSWNoPTU_LhgIAF&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristotle%20Infinity&amp;f=false|author=[[Wolfgang Achtner]]|title=Infinity: New Research Frontiers - Chapter 1 : Infinity as a Transformative concept in Science and Theology (p.22) |publisher=Cambridge University Press, 7 Feb 2011 {{ISBN|1139495569}},  edited by [[Michał Heller|Revd Dr Michael Heller]], [[W. Hugh Woodin|Dr W. Hugh Woodin]]|accessdate=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Z. Bechler"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1E619rAJGoC&amp;pg=PA119|author=Z. Bechler|title=Aristotle's Theory of Actuality (p.119)|publisher=SUNY Press, 1995,  270 pages, ''SUNY series in ancient Greek philosophy'', {{ISBN|0791422399}}|accessdate=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Bowin"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://people.ucsc.edu/~jbowin/BOWA-2.1.pdf|author=John Bowin|title=Aristotelian Infinity|publisher=[http://people.ucsc.edu/ University of California - Santa Cruz]|accessdate=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|... It is always possible to think of a larger number: for the number of times a magnitude can be bisected is infinite.  Hence the infinite is potential, never actual; the number of parts that can be taken always surpasses any assigned number.|''Physics'' 207b8}}

This is often called potential infinity; however, there are two ideas mixed up with this. One is that it is always possible to find a number of things that surpasses any given number, even if there are not actually such things. The other is that we may quantify over infinite sets without restriction. For example, &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{Z} (\exists m \in \mathbb{Z} [m &gt; n \wedge P(m)] )&lt;/math&gt;, which reads, "for any [[integer]] n, there exists an integer m &gt; n such that P(m)". The second view is found in a clearer form by medieval writers such as [[William of Ockham]]:

{{quotation|''Sed omne continuum est actualiter existens. Igitur quaelibet pars sua est vere existens in rerum natura. Sed partes continui sunt infinitae quia non tot quin plures, igitur partes infinitae sunt actualiter existentes.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But every continuum is actually existent. Therefore any of its parts is really existent in nature. But the parts of the continuum are infinite because there are not so many that there are not more, and therefore the infinite parts are actually existent.}}

The parts are actually there, in some sense. However, on this view, no infinite magnitude can have a number, for whatever number we can imagine, there is always a larger one: "There are not so many (in number) that there are no more."

Aristotle's views on the continuum foreshadow some topological aspects of modern mathematical theories of the continuum. Aristotle's emphasis on the connectedness of the continuum may have inspired—in different ways—modern philosophers and mathematicians such as Charles Sanders Peirce, Cantor, and LEJ Brouwer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aristotle and modern mathematical theories of the continuum, in Aristotle and Contemporary Science II|last=Newstead|first=A.G.J.|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2001|isbn=|location=Frankfurt|pages=113–129.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Continuous and the Discrete|last=White|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the scholastics, [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] also argued against the idea that infinity could be in any sense complete or a totality.

Aristotle deals with infinity in the context of the [[prime mover theory|prime mover]], in Book 7 of the same work, the reasoning of which was later studied and commented on by [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]].&lt;ref name="R. Sorabji (C. Hagen)"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JcjAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=R. Sorabji (C. Hagen)|title=Simplicius: On Aristotle Physics 7 (page 1.)|publisher=A&amp;C Black, 10 Apr 2014, 202 pages, ''Ancient Commentators on Aristotle'', {{ISBN|178093422X}}|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman===
====Plotinus====

[[Plotinus]] considered infinity, while he was alive, during the 3rd century A.D.&lt;ref name="F. LeRon Shults"/&gt;

====Simplicius====

Simplicius,&lt;ref name=" Dr Adam Drozdek "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n1kaVPxXJ4IC&amp;pg=PA85 |author=Dr Adam Drozdek |title=Greek Philosophers as Theologians: The Divine Arche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |date=2013-05-28 |isbn=1409477576 |page=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; alive circa 490 to 560 AD,&lt;ref name=" J J O'Connor and E F Robertson 2 "&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Simplicius.html |author=J.J. O'Connor and E.F. Robertson (April 1999)|title=Simplicius |publisher= |date= |isbn= |page=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; thought the concept "Mind"  was infinite.&lt;ref name=" Dr Adam Drozdek "/&gt;

====Augustine====

[[Augustine]] thought infinity to be "incomprehensible for the human mind".&lt;ref name=" Dr Adam Drozdek "/&gt;

===Early Indian thinking===

The [[Jainism|Jain]] upanga [[Jain Agamas|āgama]] [[Sūryaprajñapti|Surya Prajnapti]] (c. 400 BC) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:

* Enumerable: lowest, intermediate and highest
* Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable and innumerably innumerable
* Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite

[[File:Number theory 1.jpg|thumb|Jain theory of numbers (See IIIrd section for various infinities)]]
The Jains were the first to discard the idea that all infinities were the same or equal. They recognized different types of infinities: infinite in length (one [[dimension]]), infinite in area (two dimensions), infinite in volume (three dimensions), and infinite perpetually (infinite number of dimensions).

According to Singh (1987), Joseph (2000) and Agrawal (2000), the highest enumerable number ''N'' of the Jains corresponds to the modern concept of [[Aleph number|aleph-null]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (the [[cardinal number]] of the infinite set of integers 1, 2, ...), the smallest cardinal [[transfinite number]]. The Jains also defined a whole system of infinite cardinal numbers, of which the highest enumerable number ''N'' is the smallest.

In the Jaina work on the [[Set theory|theory of sets]], two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and [[Ontology|ontological]] grounds, a distinction was made between {{IAST|''asaṃkhyāta''}} ("countless, innumerable") and ''ananta'' ("endless, unlimited"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.

==Views from the Renaissance to modern times==

===Galileo===
{{main article|Galileo's paradox}}

[[Galileo Galilei]] (February 1564 - January 1642 &lt;ref name=" O'Connor, Robertson "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Galileo.html |author=J.J.  O'Connor, E.F. Robertson|title=Galileo Galilei|publisher=St Andrews University|date=2002|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;)   discussed the example of comparing the [[square number]]s {1, 4, 9, 16, ...} with the [[natural number]]s {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} as follows:
: 1 → 1&lt;br&gt; 2 → 4&lt;br&gt; 3 → 9&lt;br&gt; 4 → 16&lt;br&gt; …

It appeared by this reasoning as though a "set" (Galileo did not use the terminology) which is naturally smaller than the "set" of which it is a part (since it does not contain all the members) is in some sense the same "size". Galileo found no way around this problem:

{{quotation|So far as I see we can only infer that the totality of all numbers is infinite, that the number of squares is infinite, and that the number of their roots is infinite; neither is the number of squares less than the totality of all numbers, nor the latter greater than the former; and finally the attributes "equal," "greater," and "less," are not applicable to infinite, but only to finite, quantities.|''On two New Sciences'', 1638}}

The idea that size can be measured by one-to-one correspondence is today known as [[Hume's principle]], although Hume, like Galileo, believed the principle could not be applied to the infinite. The same concept, applied by [[Georg Cantor]], is used in relation to infinite sets.

===Thomas Hobbes===
Famously, the ultra-empiricist [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] ( April 1588 -  December 1679 &lt;ref name="  Sorell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Hobbes|author=T. Sorell |title=Thomas Hobbes (English philosopher)|publisher=Britannica |date=30 October 2014 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)  tried to defend the idea of a potential infinity in light of the discovery, by [[Evangelista Torricelli]], of a figure ([[Gabriel's Horn]]) whose [[surface area]] is infinite, but whose [[volume]] is finite.  Not reported, this motivation of Hobbes came too late as [[curve]]s having infinite length yet bounding finite areas were known much before.

===John Locke===
[[John Locke|Locke]] ( August 1632 - October 1704  &lt;ref name=" Rogers214 "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Locke |author=G.A.J. Rogers |title=John Locke, English philosopher |publisher=Brittanica |date=2015-12-14 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in common with most of the [[empiricist]] philosophers, also believed that we can have no proper idea of the infinite.  They believed all our ideas were derived from [[sense data]] or "impressions," and since all sensory impressions are inherently finite, so too are our thoughts and ideas.  Our idea of infinity is merely negative or privative.

{{quotation|Whatever ''positive'' ideas we have in our minds of any space, duration, or number, let them be never so great, they are still finite; but when we suppose an inexhaustible remainder, from which we remove all bounds, and wherein we allow the mind an endless progression of thought, without ever completing the idea, there we have our idea of infinity... yet when we would frame in our minds the idea of an infinite space or duration, that idea is very obscure and confused, because it is made up of two parts very different, if not inconsistent.  For let a man frame in his mind an idea of any space or number, as great as he will, it is plain the mind rests and terminates in that idea; which is contrary to the idea of infinity, which consists in a supposed endless progression.|Essay,  II. xvii. 7., author's emphasis}}

He considered that in considerations on the subject of eternity, which he classified as an infinity, humans are likely to make mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GZkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Locke&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5DIXVZa1LtT3ar-qgOgP&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Locke&amp;f=false Philosophical beauties selected from the works of John Locke - p.237] T.Hurst 1802 [Retrieved 2015-3-28](ed. Locke writes: And hence it is, that in disputes and reasonings concerning eternity, or any other infinite, we are apt to blunder, and involve ourselves in manifest absurdities...)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern philosophical views==
Modern discussion of the infinite is now regarded as part of set theory and mathematics. Contemporary philosophers of mathematics engage with the topic of infinity and generally acknowledge its role in mathematical practice. But, although set theory is now widely accepted, this was not always so.  Influenced by L.E.J Brouwer and verificationism in part, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] (April 1889  Vienna - April  1951 Cambridge, England &lt;ref name="  Monk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ludwig-Wittgenstein|author=R. Monk|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein, British philosopher|publisher=Britannica |date=8 April 2016 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), made an impassioned attack upon [[axiomatic set theory]], and upon the idea of the actual infinite, during his "middle period".&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web | title=  Logic of antinomies | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndjfl/1093891610 | accessdate=July 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Does the relation &lt;math&gt;m = 2n&lt;/math&gt; correlate the class of all numbers with one of its subclasses? No. It correlates any arbitrary number with another, and in that way we arrive at infinitely many pairs of classes, of which one is correlated with the other, but which are never related as class and subclass.  Neither is this infinite process itself in some sense or other such a pair of classes... In the superstition that &lt;math&gt;m = 2n&lt;/math&gt; correlates a class with its subclass, we merely have yet another case of ambiguous grammar.|''Philosophical Remarks'' § 141, cf ''Philosophical Grammar'' p. 465}}

Unlike the traditional empiricists, he thought that the infinite was in some way given to [[empirical evidence|sense experience]].

{{quotation|... I can see in space the possibility of any finite experience... we recognize [the] essential infinity of space in its smallest part."  "[Time] is infinite in the same sense as the three-dimensional space of sight and movement is infinite, even if in fact I can only see as far as the walls of my room.}}

{{quotation|... what is infinite about endlessness is only the endlessness itself.}}

===Emmanuel Levinas===
The philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]] ( January 1906, Lithuania -   December 25 1995, Paris    &lt;ref name="  Bergo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/#LifCar |author=Bergo, Bettina|title=Emmanual Levinas |publisher=Stanford University |date=23 July 2006 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; )  uses infinity to designate that which cannot be defined or reduced to knowledge or power.  In Levinas' magnum opus [[Totality and Infinity]] he says :

...infinity is produced in the relationship of the same with the other, and how the particular and the personal, which are unsurpassable, as it were magnetize the very field in which the production of infinity is enacted...

The idea of infinity is not an incidental notion forged by a subjectivity to reflect the case of an entity encountering on the outside nothing that limits it, overflowing every limit, and thereby infinite.  The production of the infinite entity is inseparable from the idea of infinity, for it is precisely in the disproportion between the idea of infinity and the infinity of which it is the idea that this exceeding of limits is produced.  The idea of infinity is the mode of being, the infinition, of infinity... All knowing qua intentionality already presupposes the idea of infinity, which is preeminently non-adequation.|p. 26-27}}

Levinas also wrote a work entitled ''Philosophy and the Idea of Infinity'', which was published during 1957.&lt;ref&gt;E. Levinas - [https://books.google.com/books?id=kH9vvm-AHfUC&amp;pg=PA47 Collected Philosophical Papers (p.47)] (Translated by A.

The '''[http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/Upload/Documents/FINAL_WEB_POLICY_FRAMEWORK_30_NOV_2015.pdf Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development (IPFSD)]''' is a dynamic document created to help governments formulate sound investment policy, especially [[international investment agreement]]s (IIAs), that capitalize on [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) for [[sustainable development]]. It was prepared by the Division on Investment and Enterprise (DIAE) of the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD). IPFSD is not a negotiated text or undertaking between States; but rather an initiative by the UNCTAD Secretariat that represents expert guidance while leaving domestic policy makers free to ''adapt and adopt.'' IPFSD is the result of numerous consultations with experts and is intended as a platform to provide for further consultation and discussion with all investment stakeholders. The main objective of the IPFSD is to create a balance between the rights and obligations of States and investors while maintaining attractive investment environments.

In the face of persistent global economic and social challenges, UNCTAD's IPFSD intends to:

*Promote a new generation of investment agreements by pursuing a broader development agenda; and
*Offer guidance to policymakers when formulating their national and international investment policies.

To that end, IPFSD defines eleven critical Core Principles. Flowing from these Core Principles IPFSD provides States guidelines and advice on formulating good investment policy including clause-by-clause options for negotiators to enhance the [[sustainable development]] value of domestic investment policies.

== Background to the IPFSD ==

IPFSD has grown out of a long precedent of [[UN]] Member States calling for sustainable economic development, an understanding that investment is a critical aspect of [[sustainable development]], and UNCTAD's three-and-a-half decades of experience in research and policy analysis.

The [[UN Charter]] promotes, ''inter alia'', the goal of economic and social progress. The [[UN Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) call for a Global Partnership for Development. In particular, Goal 8 encourages the further development of an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system, which includes a commitment to good governance, development, and poverty reduction, both nationally and internationally- concepts that apply equally to the investment system. The “Monterrey Consensus” of the UN Conference on Financing for Development 2002, acknowledges that countries need to continue their efforts to achieve a transparent, stable and predictable investment climate. The UN Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of September 2002, following up on the Rio Declaration, calls for the formulation and elaboration of national strategies for [[sustainable development]], which integrate economic, social and environmental aspects. The 4th UN Conference on [[Least Developed Countries]] (LDCs) in May 2011 adopted the Istanbul Programme of Action with a strong focus on productive capacity building and structural transformation as core elements to achieve more robust, balanced, equitable, and inclusive sustainable development. Finally, the 2012 UNCTAD XIII Conference recognized the role of FDI in sustainable development and inclusive growth.

Several other international instruments inspired the Core Principles that make up the IPFSD. They comprise, in particular, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]], the Convention on the Establishment of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the [[World Bank]] Guidelines, the [[UN Global Compact]] and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and social policy and several [[WTO]]-related agreements, including the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], the [[TRIMs]] Agreement and the Agreement on Government Procurement.

== Structure and components of the IPFSD ==
[[File:IPFSD Structure.jpg|450px|thumbnail|right]]
The IPFSD consists of eleven core principles which aim to guide the investment policy underlying IIAs. Flowing from these core principles, the IPFSD provides States guidelines and advice on formulating good investment policies. The IPFSD proposes clause-by-clause options for negotiators to strengthen the [[sustainable development]] aspects of IIAs.

IPFSD also offers an interactive online platform giving stakeholders the opportunity to critically assess policy guidelines and recommend any appropriate changes.

=== The Core Principles ===

The eleven core principles of the IPFSD are:
 
# Investment for sustainable development
# 
# Policy coherence
# 
# Public governance and institutions
# 
# Dynamic Policymaking
# 
# Balanced rights and obligations
# 
# Right to regulate
# 
# Openness to investment
# 
# Investment protection and treatment 
# 
# Investment promotion and facilitation
# 
# Corporate governance and responsibility 
# 
# International cooperation

=== National Investment Policy: Guidelines ===
The national investment policy guidelines translate the core principles for investment policy making into concrete guidelines at the national level, with a view to addressing specific policy changes. 
These guidelines are designed to ensure that investment policy is coherent with the overarching development strategy of countries, enhance the sustainable development impact of investment and promote responsible investment. The guidelines further aim to balance maximizing sustainable development outcomes while maintaining an attractive investment climate. 
The national investment policy guidelines targets policy action at three levels:

*''Strategic'' – policymakers should ground investment policy in a broad roadmap for economic growth and sustainable development, such as those set out in formal economic or industrial development strategies in many countries.
*''Normative'' – by setting rules and regulations on investment and in a range of other policy areas, policymakers can promote and regulate investment that is geared towards sustainable development goals.
*''Administrative'' – through appropriate implementation and institutional mechanisms, policymakers can ensure continued relevance and effectiveness of investment policies.

=== International Investment Agreements (IIAs):  Policy Options ===

The IPFSD aims to translate the Core Principles into concrete options for policymakers with a view to addressing today’s investment challenges by providing examples of how to draft IIAs that address sustainable development by strengthening development dimensions of IIAs, balancing the rights and obligations of States and investors, and managing the systematic complexity of the IIA regime. International investment policy must be addressed at three levels.

*''Strategic'' – this involves managing the interaction between IIAs and national policies, and those between IIAs and other international agreements e.g. human rights obligations.  The overall objective is to ensure coherence between IIAs and sustainable development goals.
*''Designing provisions for sustainable development''– this concerns addressing the policy space and balancing rights and obligations between States and investors, and effective investment promotion.
*''Building multilateral consensus on investment policy'' – this goes toward helping address the systemic challenges that emerge from overlaps and inconsistencies in the IIA regime.

The IPFSD suggests, clause-by-clause, how the IPFSD's Core Principles can be converted into concrete provisions in an IIA. Governments can choose from these explicit policy options those that best suit their countries’ levels of development and respective policy objectives.  Among others these include: adjustments of existing IIA provisions(e.g. making them more [[sustainable development]]-friendly through formulations that safeguard policy space and limit State liability); new provisions in IIAs (e.g. to balance investor rights and responsibilities and to promote responsible investment); and the introduction of Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) (e.g. clauses for less-developed Parties to calibrate the level of obligations to the country’s level of development).

Some specific clause-level recommendations include:

*Narrowing the scope-and-definition clause to exclude portfolio, short-term or speculative investments from treaty coverage;
*Formulating the fair and equitable treatment (FET) clause as an exhaustive list of State obligations (e.g. not to (i) deny justice; (ii) treat investors in a manifestly arbitrary manner; (iii) flagrantly violate due process);
*Clarifying the distinction between legitimate regulatory activity and regulatory takings giving rise to compensation (i.e. indirect expropriations);
*Limiting the Full Protection and Security (FPS) clause to establish that "physical" security and protection will only commensurate with the country's level of development;
*Limiting the scope of the transfer-of-funds clause by providing an exhaustive list of covered payments/transfers, including exceptions triggered by serious balance-of-payment difficulties, and stipulating that the investor's transfer rights are contingent on its compliance with the host State's fiscal and other transfer-related obligations;
*Including exceptions to protect human rights, health, core labour standards and the environment, along with a check-and-balance system that ensures there is enough policy space while avoiding abuse; and
*Including clauses designed to eliminate or make investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) the last resort (e.g. after the investor's exhaustion of local remedies and use of Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms).

== The New Generation of Investment Policies ==

The IPFSD embodies the new generation of investment policies that seeks to create a more intricate development strategy that maintains a favorable investment climate.  New generation investment policies seek to give investment policy a more prominent place in development strategies.  The continuous need to respond to newly emerging challenges and trends make it necessary to review and modify these guidelines.

== Dynamic Nature of IPFSD and The Investment Policy Hub ==

IPFSD has been designed with the intention of providing immediate technical assistance for the negotiation of investment agreements, while maintaining a dialog between investment policy stakeholders including the international development community, investors, business associations, labor unions, relevant NGOs and interest groups. The result of these ongoing multi-stakeholder consultations will be a dynamic document.

To that end, in concert with IPFSD, UNCTAD has provided a platform for further consultation and discussion with all investment stakeholders—the [http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/ Investment Policy Hub] which allows investment stakeholders to post comments regarding the content of the IPFSD. The combination then, of IPFSD and the Investment Policy Hub will enable IPFSD to remain a valuable resource for investment policy makers into the future.

In [[theoretical computer science]], the '''Krivine machine''' is an ''[[abstract machine]]'' (sometimes called ''[[virtual machine]]'').  As an abstract machine, it shares features with [[Turing machine]]s and the [[SECD machine]]. The Krivine machine explains how to compute a recursive function.  More specifically it aims to define rigorously [[head normal form]] reduction of a [[Lambda calculus|lambda term]] using [[call-by-name]] reduction.  Thanks to its formalism, it tells in details how a kind of reduction works and sets the theoretical foundation of the [[operational semantics]] of [[functional programming language]]s.  On the other hand, Krivine machine implements call-by-name because it evaluates the body of a β-[[reducible expression|redex]] before it evaluates its parameter. In other words, in an expression (''λ'' ''x''. ''t'') ''u'' it evaluates first ''λ'' ''x''. ''t'' before evaluating ''u''. In [[functional programming]], this would mean that in order to evaluate a function applied to a parameter, it evaluates first the function before evaluating the parameter.

The Krivine machine has been designed by the French logician [[:fr:Jean-Louis Krivine|Jean-Louis Krivine]] at the beginning of the 1980s.

== Call by name and head normal form reduction ==
{{more|lambda-calculus}}

The Krivine machine is based on two concepts related to [[lambda calculus]], namely head reduction and call by name.

=== Head normal form reduction ===

&lt;/ref&gt; (one says also β-redex) is a term of the lambda calculus of the form (''λ'' ''x''. ''t'') ''u''.   If a term has the shape (''λ'' ''x''. ''t'') ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; it is said to be a ''head redex''.  A ''[[Beta normal form|head normal form]]''  is a term of the lambda calculus which is not a  head redex{{efn|If one deals only with closed terms, that terms has the form ''λ'' ''x''. ''t''.}}  A ''head reduction'' is a (non empty) sequence of contractions of a term which contracts head redexes.  A head reduction of a term ''t'' (which is supposed not to be in head normal form) is a head reduction which starts from  a term ''t'' and ends on a head normal form.  From an abstract point of view, head reduction is the way a program computes when it evaluates a recursive sub-program. To understand how such a reduction can be implemented is important.  One of the aims of the Krivine machine is to propose a process to reduct a term in head normal form and to describe formally this process.  Like [[Alan Turing|Turing]] used an abstract machine to describe formally the notion of algorithm, [[:fr: Jean-Louis Krivine|Krivine]] used  an abstract machine to describe formally the notion of head normal form reduction.

==== An example ====
The term ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0) (which corresponds, if one uses explicit variables, to the term (''λx''.''x'') (''λy''.''y'') (''λz''.''z''))  is not in head normal form because (''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0) contracts in (''λ'' 0) yielding the head redex (''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0) which contracts in (''λ'' 0) and which is therefore the head normal form of ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0). Said otherwise the head normal form contraction is:
: ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0) ➝ (''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0) ➝ ''λ'' 0,
which corresponds to :
: (''λx''.''x'') (''λy''.''y'') (''λz''.''z'') ➝ (''λy''.''y'') (''λz''.''z'') ➝ ''λz''.''z''.
We will see further how the Krivine machine reduces the term ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0).

=== [[Call-by-name|Call by name]] ===
To implement the head reduction of a term ''u v'' which is an application, but which is not a redex, one must reduce the body ''u'' to exhibit an abstraction and therefore create a redex with ''v''. When a redex appears, one reduces it.  To reduce always the body of an application first is called ''[[Call-by-name|call by name]]''.{{efn|This ancient terminology refers to concepts of the 60's and hardly justified in 2017.}} The Krivine machine implements ''call by name''.

== Description ==

The presentation of the Krivine machine given here is based on notations of lambda terms that use [[de Bruijn indices]] and assumes that the terms of which it computes the head normal forms are [[Lambda calculus definition#Free and bound variables|closed]].&lt;ref name="Curien"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Pierre-Louis 
| last1 = Curien
| title = Categorical Combinators, Sequential Algorithms and Functional
| publisher = Birkhaüser
| year = 1993
| edition =  2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It modifies the current '''state''' until it cannot do it anymore, in which case it  obtains a head normal form.   This head normal form represents the result of the computation or yields an error, meaning that the term it started from is not correct.  However, it can enter an infinite sequence of transitions, which means that the term it attempts reducing has no head normal form and corresponds to a non terminating computation.

It has been proved that the Krivine machine implements correctly the call by name head normal form reduction in the lambda-calculus.  Moreover, the Krivine machine is [[Deterministic compilation|deterministic]], since each pattern of the state corresponds to at most one machine transition.

=== The state  ===
The state has three components&lt;ref name="Curien" /&gt;
:# a '''term''',
:# a '''stack''', 
:# an '''environment'''.

The term is a  λ-term with de Bruijn indices.  The stack and the environment belong to the same recursive data structure. More precisely, the environment and the  stack are lists of pairs ''&lt;term,&amp;nbsp;environment&gt;'', that are called ''closures''.  In what follows, the insertion as the head of a list ℓ (stack or environment) of an element ''a'' is written ''a:ℓ'', whereas the empty list is written □. The stack is the location where the machine stores the closures that must be evaluated furthermore, whereas the environment is the association between the indices and the closures at a given time during the evaluation. The first element of the environment is the closure associated with the index ''0'', the second element corresponds to the closure associated with index ''1'' etc. If the machine has to evaluate an index, it fetches there the pair ''&lt;term, environment&gt;'' the closure that yields the term to be evaluated and the environment in which this term must be evaluated.{{efn|Using the concept of closure, one may replace the triple ''&lt;term,stack, environment&gt;, which defines the state, by a couple ''&lt;closure,stack&gt;'', but this change is cosmetic.}} This intuitive explanations allow understanding the operating rules of the machine.  If one writes ''t'' for term, p for stack,{{efn|p is for ''pile'', the French word for stack, which we do not want to mix up with ''s'', for state.}} and e for environment, the states associated with these three entities will be written ''t'', p, e.  The rules explain how the machine transforms a state into another state, after identifying the patterns among the states.

The ''initial state'' aims to evaluate a term ''t'', it is the state  ''t'',□,□,  in which the term is ''t'' and the stack and the environment are empty. The ''final state'' (in absence of error) is of the form ''λ&amp;nbsp;t'',&amp;nbsp;□,&amp;nbsp;e, in other words, the resulting terms is an abstraction together with its environment and an empty stack.

=== The transitions ===
The Krivine machine&lt;ref name="Curien" /&gt; has four transitions : '''''App''''', '''''Abs''''', '''''Zero''''', '''''Succ'''''.
{| class="wikitable center" style = "width:50%"
|+ Transitions of the Krivine machine
|-

|
''t'', p, e'
|-
|
'''''Succ'''''
|
''n+1'', p, &lt;''t,e'&gt;:e
|
n, p, e
|}

The transition '''''App''''' removes the parameter of an application and put it on the stack for  further evaluation.  The transition '''''Abs''''' removes the λ of the term and pop up the closure from the top of the stack and put it on the top of the environment.  This closure corresponds to the de Bruijn index ''0'' in the new environment.  The transition '''''Zero''''' takes the first closure of the environment. The term of this closure becomes the current term and the environment of this closure becomes the current environment. The transition '''''Succ''''' removes the first closure of the environment list and decreases the value of the index.

=== Two examples ===
Let us evaluate the term (''λ'' 0 0) (''λ'' 0) which corresponds to the term (''λ'' ''x''. ''x'' ''x'') (''λ'' ''x''. ''x''). Let us start with the state (''λ'' 0 0) (''λ'' 0), □, □.

{|class="wikitable center" style= "width:30%"

|-
|
0, □, [&lt;''λ'' 0, □&gt;]
|-
|
''λ'' 0'', □, □
|-
|}

The conclusion is that the head normal form of the term  (''λ'' 0 0) (''λ'' 0) is ''λ'' 0. This translates with variables in: the head normal form of the term (''λ'' ''x''. ''x'' ''x'') (''λ'' ''x''. ''x'') is ''λ'' ''x''. ''x''.

Let us evaluate the term ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0)

{|class="wikitable center" style="width:35%"

This confirms the above fact that the normal form of the term ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0) is (''λ'' 0).

[[Convergent evolution]] — the repeated evolution of similar traits in multiple lineages which all ancestrally lack the trait — is rife in nature, as illustrated by the examples below. The ultimate cause of convergence is usually a similar evolutionary [[biome]], as similar environments will select for similar traits in any species occupying the same ecological niche, even if those species are only distantly related. In the case of [[cryptic species]], it can create species which are only distinguishable by analysing their genetics.  Unrelated organisms often develop [[analogous structures]] by adapting to similar environments.

==In animals==
[[File:Beutelwolf fg01.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The skulls of the [[thylacine]] (left) and the grey wolf, ''[[Canis lupus]]'', are similar, although the species are only very distantly related (different [[infraclass]]es). The skull shape of the red fox, ''[[Vulpes vulpes]]'', is even closer to that of the thylacine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Australian Journal of Zoology|volume=34|issue=2|year=1986|pages=109–117|title=Comparison of Skull Shape in Marsupial and Placental Carnivores|author= L Werdelin|doi=10.1071/ZO9860109}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Mammals ===

* Several groups of [[ungulate]]s have independently reduced or lost side digits on their feet, often leaving one or two digits for walking. That name comes from their hooves, which have evolved from claws several times. Among familiar animals, [[horse]]s have one walking digit and [[cattle|domestic bovine]]s two on each foot. Various other land vertebrates have also reduced or lost digits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donaldprothero.com/files/47440214.pdf The phylogeny of the ungulates - Donald Prothero]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similarly, [[laurasiathere]] [[perissodactyl]]s and [[afrothere]] [[paenungulate]]s have several features in common, to the point of there being no obvious distinction among basal taxa of both groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gheerbrant | first1 = Emmanuel | last2 = Filippo | first2 = Andrea | last3 = Schmitt | first3 = Arnaud | year = 2016 | title = Convergence of Afrotherian and Laurasiatherian Ungulate-Like Mammals: First Morphological Evidence from the Paleocene of Morocco | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 7| page = e0157556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0157556 | pmid=27384169 | pmc=4934866| bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1157556G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[pronghorn]] of [[North America]], while not a true [[antelope]] and only distantly related to them, closely resembles the true antelopes of the [[Old World]], both behaviorally and morphologically. It also fills a similar ecological niche and is found in the same [[biome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcnj.edu/~hofmann/Pronghorn.htm tcnj.edu, ANTELOPE Vs. PRONGHORN]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Members of the two clades [[Australosphenida]] and [[Theria]] evolved tribosphenic [[molar (tooth)|molars]] independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luo | first1 = Zhe-Xi | last2 = Cifelli | first2 = Richard L. | last3 = Kielan-Jaworowska | first3 = Zofia | year = 2001 | title = Dual origin of tribosphenic mammals | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6816| pages = 53–57 | doi = 10.1038/35051023 | pmid = 11343108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[marsupial]] [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf) had many resemblances to [[placental]] [[canids]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kyletaitt.scienceblog.com/2013/02/07/the-curious-evolutionary-history-of-the-marsupial-wolf/ The Curious Evolutionary History of the ‘Marsupial Wolf’ by Kyle Taitt]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Several mammal groups have independently evolved prickly protrusions of the skin – [[echidna]]s ([[monotreme]]s), the insectivorous [[hedgehog]]s, some [[tenrec]]s (a diverse group of shrew-like [[Madagascar|Madagascan]] mammals), [[Old World porcupine]]s ([[rodent]]s) and [[New World porcupine]]s (another biological family of rodents). In this case, because the two groups of porcupines are closely related, they would be considered to be examples of [[parallel evolution]]; however, neither echidnas, nor hedgehogs, nor tenrecs are close relatives of the Rodentia. In fact, the last common ancestor of all of these groups was a contemporary of the [[dinosaur]]s.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Zoology, Page 102, by Joseph Springer, Dennis Holley, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[eutriconodont]] [[Spinolestes]] that lived in the Early Cretaceous Period represents an even earlier example of a spined mammal, unrelated to any modern mammal group.
* [[Cat|Cat-like]] sabre-toothed predators evolved in three distinct lineages of mammals – [[carnivora]]ns like the [[sabre-toothed cat]]s, and [[nimravid]]s ("false" sabre-tooths), the [[sparassodont]] family [[Thylacosmilidae]] ("marsupial" sabre-tooths), the [[gorgonopsid]]s and the [[creodont]]s also developed long [[canine teeth]], but with no other particular physical similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Convergent Evolution: Limited Forms Most Beautiful, page 158, by George R. McGhee, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* A number of mammals have developed powerful fore claws and long, sticky tongues that allow them to open the homes of social insects (e.g., [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s) and consume them (myrmecophagy).  These include the four species of [[anteater]], more than a dozen [[armadillo]]s, eight species of [[pangolin]] (plus fossil species), eight species of the [[monotreme]] (egg-laying mammals) [[echidna]] (plus fossil species), the  ''[[Fruitafossor]]'' of the Late Jurassic, the marsupial [[numbat]], the African [[aardvark]], the [[aardwolf]], and possibly also the [[sloth bear]] of South Asia, all unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/15/science/when-nature-discovers-the-same-design-over-and-over.html When Nature Discovers The Same Design Over and Over, By NATALIE ANGIER, Published: December 15, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marsupial]] [[Koalas]] of [[Australia]] have evolved [[fingerprint]]s, indistinguishable from those of non-related [[primates]], such as humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A14608541 BBC, Koalas' Fingerprints]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Australian [[honey possum]]s acquired a long tongue for taking nectar from flowers, a structure similar to that of [[Lepidoptera|butterflies]], some moths, and hummingbirds, and used to accomplish the same task.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reellifescience.com/2013/10/16/convergent-evolution-are-dolphins-and-bats-more-related-than-we-think-by-cariosa-switzer/ Convergent EVOLUTION: "Are Dolphins and Bats more related than we think?" by Cariosa Switzer, October 16, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marsupial]] [[sugar glider]] and [[squirrel glider]] of Australia are like the [[placental]] [[flying squirrel]]. Both lineages have independently developed wing-like flaps ([[patagia]]) for leaping from trees, and big eyes for foraging at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analogy: Squirrels and Sugar Gliders|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/analogy_02|work=Understanding Evolution|publisher=The University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The North American [[kangaroo rat]], Australian [[hopping mouse]], and [[North Africa]]n and Asian [[jerboa]] have developed convergent adaptations for hot desert environments; these include a small rounded body shape with large hind legs and long thin tails, a characteristic [[bipedal]] hop, and nocturnal, burrowing and seed-eating behaviours. These rodent groups fill similar niches in their respective ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desertusa.com/animals /jerboa.html desertusa.com, The Jerboa, by Jay Sharp]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Opossum]]s and their [[Phalangeriformes|Australasian cousin]]s have evolved an [[opposable thumb]], a feature which is also commonly found in the non-related [[primates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jacusers.johnabbott.qc.ca/~biology/NYA/labs/NYASKELETONLAB/NYASKELETONINDEX-1.htm johnabbott.qc.ca, COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF VERTEBRATE SKELETA]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[marsupial]] [[Tasmanian devil]] has many resemblances to the [[placental]] [[hyena]] or a [[wolverine]]. Similar skull morphology, large canines and crushing carnasial molars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devilsatcradle.com/content.php?id=devil-facts devilsatcradle.com, Tasmanian Devil - Sarcophilus harrisii Taxonomy]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marsupial]] [[kangaroo]]s and [[wallaby|wallabies]] have many resemblances to the [[Mara (mammal)|Maras]] (a large [[rodent]] from the cavy family ([[Caviidae]])), [[rabbit]]s and [[hare]]s ([[lagomorph]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, Volume 27, page 382, By Joel Asaph Allen&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Thylacoleonidae|marsupial lion]], ''[[Thylacoleo carnifex]]'', had retractable claws, the same way the placental [[Felinae|felines]] ([[cat]]s) do today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldinosaurmuseum.com.au/Thylacoleo.htm nationaldinosaurmuseum.com.au Thylacoleo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085747/http://www.nationaldinosaurmuseum.com.au/Thylacoleo.htm |date=2014-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Microbat]]s, [[toothed whale]]s and [[shrew]]s developed [[sonar]]-like [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] systems used for orientation, obstacle avoidance and for locating prey. Modern DNA phylogenies of bats have shown that the traditional suborder of echolocating bats (Microchiroptera) is not a true clade, and instead some echolocating bats are more related to non-echolocating Old World fruit bats than to other echolocating species. The implication is that [[Animal echolocation#Bats|echolocation]] in at least two lineages of [[bat]]s, [[Megachiroptera]] and [[Microchiroptera]] has evolved independently or been lost in Old World fruit bats.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Carol Kaesuk.

Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Animal echolocation|Echolocation]] in [[bat]]s and whales also both necessitate high frequency hearing. The protein [[prestin]], which confers high hearing sensitivity in mammals, shows molecular convergence between the two main clades of echolocating bats, and also between [[bat]]s and [[dolphin]]s.&lt;ref name="Liu2010first"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu Y, Cotton JA, Shen B, Han X, Rossiter SJ, Zhang S | title = Convergent sequence evolution between echolocating bats and dolphins. | journal = Current Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = R53–54 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20129036| doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.058| url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Liu, Y, Rossiter SJ, Han X, Cotton JA, Zhang S | title = Cetaceans on a molecular fast track to ultrasonic hearing | journal = Current Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 20| pages = 1834–1839 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20933423| doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2010.09.008| url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hearing genes also show convergence between echolocating taxa.&lt;ref name="Davies2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davies KT, Cotton JA, Kirwan J, Teeling EC, Rossiter SJ | title = Parallel signatures of sequence evolution among hearing genes in echolocating mammals: an emerging model of genetic convergence | journal = Heredity | volume = 108| issue = 5| pages = 480–489| year = 2011 | pmid = 22167055| doi = 10.1038/hdy.2011.119 | issn = | pmc=3330687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently the first genome-wide study of convergence was published, this study analysed 22 mammal genomes and revealed that tens of genes have undergone the same replacements in echolocating bats and ceteaceans, with many of these genes encoding proteins that function in hearing and vision.&lt;ref name="Parkeretal2013"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature12511 | pmid = 24005325 | last1 = Parker | first1 = J | last2 = Tsagkogeorga | first2 = G | last3 = Cotton | first3 = JA | last4 = Liu | first4 = Y | last5 = Provero | first5 = P | last6 = Stupka | first6 = E | last7= Rossiter | first7 = SJ | year = 2013 | title = Genome-wide signatures of convergent evolution in echolocating mammals | journal = Nature | volume = 502 | pages = 228–231 | issue=7470 | bibcode=2013Natur.502..228P| pmc = 3836225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both the [[aye-aye]] lemur and the [[striped possum]] have an elongated finger used to get invertebrates from trees. There are no [[woodpeckers]] in [[Madagascar]] or [[Australia]] where the species evolved, so the supply of invertebrates in trees was large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=20FE10D598E471B9EF8808654FABA7FD.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=108809 Rawlins, D.

* Red blood cells in mammals lack a cell nucleus. In comparison, the red blood cells of other vertebrates have nuclei; the only known exceptions are salamanders of the genus ''[[Batrachoseps]]'' and fish of the genus ''[[Maurolicus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdcirculatory.html http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdcirculatory.html,  Eastern Kentucky University, Ornithology, Avian Circulatory System]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Caniform]]s like [[skunk]]s and [[Procyonidae|raccoon]]s in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] and [[feliform]]s such as [[mongoose]] and [[civet]]s in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] have both evolved to fill the niche of small to medium omnivore/insectivore on their side of the world. Some species of mongoose and civet can even spray their attacker with musk similar to the skunk and some civets have also independently evolved similar markings to the raccoon such as the [[African civet]].&lt;ref&gt;The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, By Richard Estes&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Fossa (animal)|Fossa]] of [[Madagascar]] looks like a small cat. Fossa have semiretractable [[claw]]s. Fossa also has flexible ankles that allow it to climb up and down trees head-first, and also support jumping from tree to tree.

* [[Swim bladder]]s: Buoyant bladders independently evolved in [[fish]]es, the [[tuberculate pelagic octopus]], and [[siphonophores]] such as the [[Portuguese man o' war]].&lt;ref&gt;"The illustration of the swim bladder in fishes is a good one, because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose, namely, flotation, may be converted into one for a widely different purpose, namely, respiration. The swim bladder has, also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fishes. All physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous, or "ideally similar" in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there is no reason to doubt that the swim bladder has actually been converted into lungs, or an organ used exclusively for respiration.  According to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals with true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient and unknown prototype, which was furnished with a floating apparatus or swim bladder."  Darwin, Origin of Species.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bivalve]]s and [[brachiopod]]s independently evolved paired hinged shells for protection. However, the anatomy of their soft parts is very dissimilar, which is why molluscs and brachiopods are put into different phyla.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fossilplot.org/Bivalve_Brach_Exercise.pdf fossilplot.org, Brachiopods and Bivalves: paired shells, with different histories]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jet propulsion]] in [[squid]]s and in [[scallop]]s: these two groups of mollusks have very different ways of squeezing water through their bodies in order to power rapid movement through a fluid. (Dragonfly larvae in the aquatic stage also use an anal jet to propel them, and [[jellyfish]] have used jet propulsion for a very long time.). Sea hares (gastropod molluscs) employ a similar means of jet propulsion, but without the sophisticated neurological machinery of cephalopods they navigate somewhat more clumsily.&lt;ref name='Mill2004'&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P.

* The structure of [[immunoglobulin]] G-binding bacterial proteins A and H do not contain any sequences homologous to the constant repeats of IgG antibodies, but they have similar functions. Both protein G, A, H are inhibited in the interactions with IgG antibodies (IgGFc) by a synthetic peptide corresponding to an 11-amino-acid-long sequence in the COOH-terminal region of the repeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Frick IM, Wikström M, Forsén S, etal |title=Convergent evolution among immunoglobulin G-binding bacterial proteins |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=89 |issue=18 |pages=8532–6 |date=September 1992 |pmid=1528858 |pmc=49954 |doi=10.1073/pnas.89.18.8532|bibcode=1992PNAS...89.8532F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural convergence ===
Here is a list of examples in which unrelated proteins have similar tertiary structures but different functions. Whole protein structural convergence is not thought to occur but some convergence of pockets and secondary structural elements have been documented.

* Some secondary structure convergence occurs due to some residues favouring being in α-helix (helical propensity) and for hydrophobic patches or pocket to be formed at the ends of the parallel sheets.&lt;ref name="Rao, S. T. 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao ST, Rossmann MG |title=Comparison of super-secondary structures in proteins |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=241–56 |date=May 1973  |pmid=4737475 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(73)90388-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23016">The following is a '''list of [[tautonym]]s''': [[zoological]] names of species consisting of two identical words (the [[genus|generic name]] and the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] have the same spelling). Such names are allowed in [[zoology]], but not in [[botany]], where the two parts of the name of a species must differ (though differences as small as one letter are permitted, as in the [[jujube]] (''Ziziphus zizyphus'')).

'''Matthew Pilkington''' (1701–1774), [[Church of Ireland]] priest, writer, and art historian, was the author of a standard text on painters that became known as ''Pilkington's Dictionary''. His first wife was the poet and memoirist [[Laetitia Pilkington]] and their second son was the singer and writer [[John Carteret Pilkington]].

==Career==
Born in 1701 in [[County Offaly|King's County]], his parents were William Pilkington, originally a watchmaker who later kept a Dublin alehouse and died in 1748, and his wife Alice, who died in 1749. He entered [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in 1721 and graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1722, and was ordained a [[deacon]] in the Church of Ireland in 1723. By 1725, when he qualified for an [[Master of Arts|MA]], he was a [[reader (liturgy)|reader]] in [[St Andrew's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)|St Andrew's Church, Dublin]] and was courting a parishioner, Laetitia van Lewen. The pair married on 31 May and both became friends of [[Jonathan Swift]], the [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]], who encouraged their gifts for poetry and satire and introduced them to other Irish literary figures such as [[Mary Barber (poet)|Mary Barber]], [[Constantia Grierson]] and [[Patrick Delany (theologian)|Patrick Delany]].&lt;ref name = "Elias"&gt;{{cite book|first = A.C.|last = Elias, Jr.|article= Pilkington, Matthew (1701–1774) |title = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (subscription or UK public library membership required)|year= 2004|url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22276|access-date = 14 September 2014|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Swift's influence, Matthew obtained the post of chaplain to the [[Lord Mayor of London]] in 1732 and, leaving Laetitia in Dublin, mixed with leading figures on the English theatrical and literary scene, including [[Alexander Pope]]. However, he also antagonised influential people and was imprisoned in 1734. Going quietly back to Dublin after his release, he had lost the support of most Irish literary figures, including Swift, and instead associated with such characters as the rascally painter [[James Worsdale]] and [[Edward Walpole]], the prime minister's dissolute son. There followed a very public rupture with Laetitia, ending in an [[ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical]] divorce in 1738 that left him as the supposed innocent party with custody of their children.&lt;ref name = "Elias"/&gt;

Though living in Dublin, he then obtained church posts in villages outside and devoted himself to art history. In this endeavour he enjoyed the continued support of [[Charles Cobbe]], [[Archbishop of Dublin]] from 1743 to 1765, and then of his son Thomas Cobbe, acting as their secretary and using his knowledge of paintings to help build their collection at [[Newbridge Estate|Newbridge House]]. Despite a modest income, he also acquired some significant works for himself. In 1770 he saw published the major work for which he is remembered: ''The Gentleman's and Connoisseur's Dictionary of Painters''. He died in Dublin on 18 July 1774, his second wife living on until 1785.&lt;ref name = "Elias"/&gt;

==Family==
His first wife Laetitia van Lewen, born about 1709 in [[County Cork|Cork]] and like him diminutive, was the eldest child of a prominent Dublin obstetrician, Dr John van Lewen. Three of their children died in infancy and the later life of their daughter Betty is unclear. Of the two surviving sons, William the elder became a Church of Ireland clergyman holding rural livings, while Jack (John Carteret Pilkington) had a short but colourful career as singer, soldier, actor and writer in Ireland and in England.&lt;ref name = "Elias"/&gt; Jack was an ancestor of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st_Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]].

After divorcing Laetitia in 1738, Matthew took Nancy Sandes as his mistress, marrying her on 27 Aug 1750 less than a month after Laetitia's death. Neither of the two children they had survived infancy. In his will of 14 Feb 1754, since destroyed, though he owned houses he had inherited from his parents and valuable artworks, he left his eldest son only five pounds while the estranged Jack and Betty were left one shilling each.&lt;ref name = "Elias"/&gt;

==Works==
Some of Pilkington's published works were anonymous or pseudonymous, but his authorship is either obvious or generally recognised. It is however possible that other works under so far unattributed pseudonyms were by him as well. The book which made his name, however, was ''The Gentleman's and Connoisseur's Dictionary of Painters'', which was regularly  expanded, revised, and retitled through many editions, being renamed ''A Dictionary of Painters'' in the 1805 and 1810 versions of [[Henry Fuseli]], and then ''A General Dictionary of Painters'' after 1824, commonly known as ''Pilkington's Dictionary''.&lt;ref name = "Elias"/&gt; His works were not free of controversy, some of which he sought, and an example is his contribution to [[Rapin de Thoyras]]' ''Impartial History'' (1784) which has been described as, "an extreme falsification of his life".&lt;ref name="Sorensen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/pilkingtonm.htm|title=Pilkington, Matthew|last=Sorensen|first=Lee|date=27 November 2000|work=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fats}}
In [[biochemistry]] and nutrition, '''monounsaturated fatty acids '''(abbreviated '''MUFAs''', or more plainly '''monounsaturated fats''') are [[fatty acids]] that have one [[double bond]] in the fatty acid chain with all of the remainder [[carbon]] [[atom]]s being [[single bond|single-bonded]]. By contrast, [[polyunsaturated]] fatty acids (PUFAs) have more than one double bond.

==Molecular description==
[[Fatty acid]]s are long-chained [[molecule]]s having an [[alkyl]] group at one end and a [[carboxylic acid]] group at the other end. Fatty acid [[viscosity]] (thickness) and [[melting point|melting temperature]] increases with decreasing number of double bonds; therefore, monounsaturated fatty acids have a higher melting point than polyunsaturated fatty acids (more double bonds) and a lower melting point than [[saturated fat|saturated]] fatty acids (no double bonds). Monounsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature and semisolid or solid when refrigerated resulting in a isotopic lattice structure.

Common monounsaturated fatty acids are [[palmitoleic acid]] (16:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;7), cis-vaccenic acid (18:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;7) and [[oleic acid]] (18:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;9). Palmitoleic acid has 16 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 7 carbon atoms away from the methyl group (and 9 carbons from the carboxyl end). It can be lengthened to the 18-carbon [[cis-vaccenic acid]]. Oleic acid has 18 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 9 carbon atoms away from the carboxylic acid group. The illustrations below show a molecule of oleic acid in Lewis formula and as a [[space-filling model]].

Monounsaturated fats protect against cardiovascular disease by providing more [[biological membrane|membrane]] fluidity than saturated fats, but they are more vulnerable to [[lipid peroxidation]] ([[rancidification|rancidity]]). The large scale KANWU study found that increasing monounsaturated fat and decreasing saturated fat intake could improve insulin sensitivity, but only when the overall fat intake of the diet was low.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies have shown that substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure. More physical activity was associated with a higher-oleic acid diet than one of a [[palmitic acid]] diet. From the study, it is shown that more monounsaturated fats lead to less anger and irritability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kien CL, Bunn JY, Tompkins CL, Dumas JA, Crain KI, Ebenstein DB, Koves TR, Muoio DM | title = Substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure and with changes in mood | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 689–97 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23446891 | pmc = 3607650 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.112.051730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels of [[oleic acid]] along with other monounsaturated fatty acids in red blood cell membranes were positively associated with [[breast cancer]] risk. The [[saturation index]] (SI) of the same membranes was inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Monounsaturated fats and low SI in erythrocyte membranes are predictors of postmenopausal breast cancer. Both of these variables depend on the activity of the enzyme [[delta-9 desaturase]] (Δ9-d).&lt;ref&gt;

In children, consumption of monounsaturated oils is associated with healthier serum lipid profiles.&lt;ref name=pmid_17333272&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanchez-Bayle M, Gonzalez-Requejo A, Pelaez MJ, Morales MT, Asensio-Anton J, Anton-Pacheco E | title = A cross-sectional study of dietary habits and lipid profiles.

The [[Mediterranean diet]] is one heavily influenced by monounsaturated fats. People in Mediterranean countries consume more total fat than Northern European countries, but most of the fat is in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids from olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids from fish, vegetables, and certain meats like lamb, while consumption of saturated fat is minimal in comparison.
A 2017 review found evidence that the practice of a Mediterranean diet could lead to a decreased risk of [[cardiovascular diseases]], overall [[cancer]] incidence, [[neurodegenerative diseases]], [[diabetes]], and [[mortality rate|early death]].&lt;ref name=Dinu2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinu|first1=M|last2=Pagliai|first2=G|last3=Casini|first3=A|last4=Sofi|first4=F|title=Mediterranean diet and multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised trials.|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=10 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2017.58|pmid=28488692|volume=72|pages=30–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 review showed that the practice of the Mediterranean diet may improve overall health status, such as reduced risk of non-communicable diseases, reduced total [[cost of living|costs of living]], and reduced costs for national [[healthcare]].&lt;ref name="martinez-lacoba2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinez-Lacoba|first1=R|last2=Pardo-Garcia|first2=I|last3=Amo-Saus|first3=E|last4=Escribano-Sotos|first4=F|title=Mediterranean diet and health outcomes: a systematic meta-review.|journal=European Journal of Public Health|date= 2018|doi=10.1093/eurpub/cky113|pmid=29992229|volume=Advance articles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In animal anatomy, the '''mouth''', also known as the '''oral cavity''', '''buccal cavity''', or in Latin '''cavum oris''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/242.html |title=[[Gray's Anatomy]] |authorlink=Henry Gray |first=Henry |last=Gray |chapter=2a. The Mouth|year=1918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the opening through which many animals take in food and issue vocal sounds. It is also the cavity lying at the upper end of the [[alimentary canal]], bounded on the outside by the lips and inside by the pharynx and containing in [[higher vertebrates]] the tongue and teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mouth definition |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mouth |work=Dictionary Reference|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This cavity is also known as the '''buccal cavity''', from the Latin ''bucca'' ("cheek").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buccal definition |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/buccal |work=Dictionary Reference|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some animal [[phylum|phyla]], including [[vertebrate]]s, have a complete [[digestive system]], with a mouth at one end and an [[anus]] at the other. Which end forms first in [[ontogeny]] is a criterion used to classify animals into [[protostome]]s and [[deuterostome]]s.

==Development==
{{main|Protostome|Deuterostome}}
[[File:Protovsdeuterostomes.svg|thumb|left|250px|Development of the mouth and anus in protostomes and deuterostomes]]
In the first [[Multicellular organism|multicellular animals]] there was probably no mouth or gut and food particles were engulfed by the cells on the exterior surface by a process known as [[endocytosis]]. The particles became enclosed in [[vacuole]]s into which enzymes were secreted and digestion took place [[intracellular]]ly. The digestive products were absorbed into the cytoplasm and diffused into other cells. This form of digestion is used nowadays by simple organisms such as ''[[Amoeba (genus)|Amoeba]]'' and ''[[Paramecium]]'' and also by [[Porifera|sponges]] which, despite their large size, have no mouth or gut and capture their food by endocytosis.&lt;ref name=Dorit242&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=241–242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of other multicellular organisms have a mouth and a gut, the lining of which is continuous with the epithelial cells on the surface of the body. A few animals which live parasitically originally had guts but have secondarily lost these structures. The original gut of multicellular organisms probably consisted of a simple sac with a single opening, the mouth. Many modern invertebrates have such a system, food being ingested through the mouth, partially broken down by enzymes secreted in the gut, and the resulting particles engulfed by the other cells in the gut lining. Indigestible waste is ejected through the mouth.&lt;ref name=Dorit242/&gt;

In animals at least as complex as an [[earthworm]], the [[embryo]] forms a dent on one side, the [[blastopore]], which deepens to become the [[archenteron]], the first phase in the formation of the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]]. In deuterostomes, the blastopore becomes the anus while the gut eventually tunnels through to make another opening, which forms the mouth. In the protostomes, it used to be thought that the blastopore formed the mouth (''[[wikt:proto-|proto–]]'' meaning "first") while the anus formed later as an opening made by the other end of the gut. More recent research, however, shows that in protostomes the edges of the slit-like blastopore close up in the middle, leaving openings at both ends that become the mouth and anus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evolution of the bilaterian larval foregut |author1=Arendt, D. |author2=Technau, U. |author3=Wittbrodt, J. | journal=Nature | volume=409 | pages=81–85 | year=2001 | doi=10.1038/35051075 | pmid=11343117 | issue=6816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
===Invertebrates===
[[File:Butterfly tongue.jpg|thumb|[[Butterfly]] tongue]]

Apart from sponges and [[placozoa]]ns, almost all animals have an internal gut cavity which is lined with gastrodermal cells. In less advanced invertebrates such as the [[sea anemone]], the mouth also acts as an anus. Circular muscles around the mouth are able to relax or contract in order to open or close it. A fringe of tentacles thrusts food into the cavity and it can gape widely enough to accommodate large prey items. Food passes first into a [[pharynx]] and digestion occurs extracellularly in the [[gastrovascular cavity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Annelids have simple tube-like gets and the possession of an anus allows them to separate the digestion of their foodstuffs from the absorption of the nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many molluscs have a [[radula]] which is used to scrape microscopic particles off surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In invertebrates with hard exoskeletons, various mouthparts may be involved in feeding behaviour. Insects have a range of mouthparts suited to their mode of feeding. These include mandibles, maxillae and labium and can be modified into suitable appendages for chewing, cutting, piercing, sponging and sucking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |pages=727–731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decapoda|Decapods]] have six pairs of mouth appendages, one pair of mandibles, two pairs of maxillae and three of [[maxilliped]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=634 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea urchins have a set of five sharp calcareous plates which are used as jaws and are known as Aristotle's lantern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=902 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertebrates===
In vertebrates, the first part of the digestive system is the [[buccal cavity]], commonly known as the mouth. The buccal cavity of a fish is separated from the opercular cavity by the gills. Water flows in through the mouth, passes over the gills and exits via the [[Operculum (fish)|operculum]] or [[gill slit]]s. Nearly all fish have [[Fish jaw|jaws]] and may seize food with them but most feed by opening their jaws, expanding their pharynx and sucking in food items. The food may be held or chewed by teeth located in the jaws, on the roof of the mouth, on the pharynx or on the [[gill arch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |page=818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Litoria chloris calling.jpg|thumb|''[[Litoria chloris]]'' calling]]
Nearly all amphibians are carnivorous as adults. Many catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth where they hold the prey with their jaws. They then swallow their food whole without much chewing.&lt;ref name=Dorit847&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |page=847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically have many small hinged [[pedicellate teeth]], the bases of which are attached to the jaws while the crowns break off at intervals and are replaced. Most amphibians have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs lack teeth in the lower jaw. In many amphibians there are also [[vomerine teeth]] attached to the bone in the roof of the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C.|authorlink1=Robert C. Stebbins |last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03281-8 |pages=57–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mouths of reptiles are largely similar to those of mammals. The [[crocodilia]]ns are the only reptiles to have teeth anchored in [[Tooth socket|sockets]] in their jaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=LeBlanc, A. R. H.; Reisz, R. R.|year=2013|title=Periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone in the oldest herbivorous tetrapods, and their evolutionary significance |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=9 |page=e74697 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0074697 |editor1-last=Viriot |editor1-first=Laurent |pmid=24023957 |pmc=3762739}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are able to replace each of their approximately 80 teeth up to 50 times during their lives.&lt;ref name=teeth&gt;{{cite news |title=Solving an alligator mystery may help humans regrow lost teeth |author=Nuwer, Rachel |url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/05/solving-an-alligator-mystery-may-help-humans-regrow-lost-teeth/#ixzz2jeiA3qon |newspaper=Smithsonian.com |date=13 May 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most reptiles are either carnivorous or insectivorous but turtles are herbivorous. Lacking teeth that are suitable for efficiently chewing of their food, turtles often have [[gastrolith]]s in their stomach to further grind the plant material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King |first=Gillian |title=Reptiles and Herbivory |year=1996 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |isbn=0412461102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Snakes have a very flexible lower jaw, the two halves of which are not rigidly attached, and numerous other joints in their skull. These modifications allow them to open their mouths wide enough to swallow their prey whole, even if it is wider than they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Behler |first = John L. |last2 = King |first2 = F. Wayne |title = The Audubon Society Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of North America |publisher = Alfred A. Knopf |page = 581 |year= 1979 |isbn = 0-394-50824-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds do not have teeth, relying instead on other means of gripping and macerating their food. Their [[beak]]s have a range of sizes and shapes according to their diet and are composed of elongated mandibles. The upper mandible may have a nasofrontal hinge allowing the beak to open wider than would otherwise be possible. The exterior surface of beaks is composed of a thin, horny sheath of [[keratin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ornithology |first=Frank B. |last=Gill |edition=2 |year=1995 |publisher=W. H. Freeman &amp; Co |page=149 |isbn=0-7167-2415-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nectar feeders such as [[hummingbird]]s have specially adapted brushy tongues for sucking up nectar from flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paton |first=D. C. |date=1 April 1989|title=Bills and tongues of nectar-feeding birds: A review of morphology, function, and performance, with intercontinental comparisons |journal=Australian Journal of Ecology |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=473–506 |doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1989.tb01457.x |first2=B. G. |last2=Collins }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals the buccal cavity is typically roofed by the [[Hard palate|hard]] and [[soft palate]]s, floored by the [[tongue]] and surrounded by the [[cheek]]s, [[salivary glands]], upper and lower [[teeth]]. The upper teeth are embedded in the [[Maxilla|upper jaw]] and the lower teeth in the [[lower jaw]], which articulates with the [[temporal bone]]s of the [[skull]]. The [[lips]] are soft and fleshy folds which shape the entrance into the mouth. The buccal cavity empties through the [[pharynx]] into the [[oesophagus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-buccal-cavity.htm |title=What is the buccal cavity? |date= |work=WiseGeek |publisher=Conjecture Corporation |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other functions of the mouth==
[[Crocodilia]]ns living in the tropics can gape with their mouths to provide cooling by [[evaporation]] from the mouth lining.&lt;ref name=Ross51&gt;{{cite book |title=Crocodiles and Alligators |editor=Ross, Charles A. |year=1992 |publisher=Blitz | pages=48–51 |isbn=978-1-85391-092-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mammals rely on panting for [[thermoregulation]] as it increases evaporation of water across the moist surfaces of the lungs, the tongue and mouth. Birds also avoid overheating by gular fluttering, flapping the wings near the gular (throat) skin, similar to panting in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robertshaw, David |year=2006 |title=Mechanisms for the control of respiratory evaporative heat loss in panting animals |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=664–668 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01380.2005 |pmid=16675613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tasdevil large.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tasmanian devil]] in defensive stance]]
Various animals use their mouths in threat displays. They may gape widely, exhibit their teeth prominently or flash the startling colours of the mouth lining. This display allows each potential combatant an opportunity to assess the weapons of their opponent and lessens the likelihood of actual combat being necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Showing Off Your Weapons In The Animal Kingdom: Threat Displays May Prevent Serious Physical Harm |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/06/060621082724.htm |newspaper=ScienceDaily |date=2006-06-21 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of species of bird use a gaping, open beak in their fear and threat displays. Some augment the display by hissing or breathing heavily, while others clap their beaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Songs, Roars and Rituals: Communication in Birds, Mammals and Other Animals |first1=Lesley J. |last1=Rogers |first2=Gisela T. |last2=Kaplan |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Boston, MA |year=2000 |page=79 |isbn=0-674-00827-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mouths are also used as part of the mechanism for producing sounds for communication. To produce sounds, air is forced from the lungs over [[vocal cord]]s in the larynx. In humans, the pharynx, the soft palate, the hard palate, the [[alveolar ridge]], the tongue, the teeth and the lips are termed [[Articulatory phonetics|articulators]] and play their part in the production of speech. Varying the position of the tongue in relation to the other articulators or moving the lips restricts the airflow from the lungs in different ways producing a range of different sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~llsroach/phon2/artic-basics.htm |title=The production of speech sounds: Articulators above the larynx |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In frogs, the sounds can be amplified using sacs in the throat region.The vocal sacs can be inflated and deflated and act as resonators to transfer the sound to the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |authorlink1=Robert C.

For each burst of song the bird opens its beak and closes it again afterwards. The beak may move slightly and may contribute to the resonance but the song originates elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Bird_Voices.html |title=Bird voices |author1=Ehrlich, Paul R. |author2=Dobkin, David S. |author3=Wheye, Darryl |year=1998 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SolarEclipse BC 1335-03-13.gif|thumb|right|200px|The eclipse of 1335]]
The [[solar eclipse]] mentioned in a text dating to the reign of [[Mursili II]] could be of great importance for the absolute chronology of the [[Hittite Empire]] within the [[chronology of the Ancient Near East]]. The text records that in the tenth year of Mursili's reign, "the Sun gave a sign" (''{{lang|hit|istanus sakiyahta}}''), just as the king was about to launch a campaign against the Kingdom of [[Azzi-Hayasa]] in north-eastern Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;KUB XIV 4.24: [''ma-a-an I-NA'' KUR ''A'']''zi-ma i-ia-ah-at nu'' &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;[[Shamash|UTU]]''-us sa-ki-ya-ah-ta'' "[When] I marched [to the land of A]zzi, the Sungod gave a sign." Theo P. J. Van Den Hout, ''The Purity of Kingship: An Edition of CTH 569 and Related Hittite Oracle Inquiries of Tutẖaliya'' (1998),  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7DTPyG4VvpcC&amp;pg=PA42  42f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference in the annals was first interpreted as describing an eclipse by [[Emil Forrer]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;E. Forrer,  ''Forschungen II'' 1.1 "Astronomische Festlegung des Soppiluljomas, Morsilis und Amenophis IV." (1926) KUB XIV,4 (= CTH 70).&lt;/ref&gt; Schorr (1928) identified it as the  eclipse the  of 13 March 1335 BC, visible as [[annular eclipse|annular]] in Anatolia in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomische Abhandlungen''  8-9 (1929), p. 16. ''Mitteilungen des Instituts für Orientforschung  6 (1958), 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is now more commonly identified as the one of 24 June 1312, which was visible in [[total eclipse|totality]] in northern Anatolia in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1998){{page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Åström]] (1993) proposes the alternative date of 13 April 1308, which would have been visible as partial eclipse at sunrise. [[Peter J. Huber]] has suggested a date of 8 January 1339 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Huber, The Solar Omen of Muršili II,  Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 121, no. 4, pp. 640-644, (Oct. - Dec., 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==1312 eclipse==
The 1312 eclipse occurred over northern Anatolia in the early afternoon, and its effects would have been quite spectacular for Mursili and his men on campaign:
:24 June 1312 BC, total eclipse, maximum at 10:44 UTC, {{coord|38.2|N|13.7|E}} ([[Sicily]]) and lasted 2 min 48 sec, some stated as it occurred inside the [[Ionian Sea]] at 17 E.

Areas that were inside the maximum eclipse included the islands that are now Barlavento in [[Cape Verde]], the Moorish lands (comprising modern day [[Mauritania]], [[Western Sahara]], [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]]), [[Tunisia]] (then inner Africa), [[Greece]], the [[Caucasus]] region, Persia (now Iran), in the area of the present-day Iranian-Turkmeni border, present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan and a part of the north of [[India]].

The eclipse started off in modern-day [[Brazil]] in South America and finished in what is now [[Myanmar]] (also known as [[Burma]]).

The 1312 date would imply that Mursili began his reign in either 1322 or 1321 BC. This date would be roughly that usually proposed for the death of [[Tutankhamun]]. It is known that [[Suppiluliuma I]] was besieging [[Carchemish]] when he received a letter from the widow of a [[Pharaoh]] (who is called [[Dakhamunzu]] in the annals). Suppiluliuma died shortly thereafter and his successor was Mursili II (whose brother would have been Prince [[Zannanza]] sent to Egypt where he died). Thus this appears to be a chronological anchor. However, there are other views, asserting for example that the dead Pharaoh was [[Akhenaten]] or that Tutankhamun died later.

==1308 eclipse==
In contrast, the 1308 eclipse was annular, and began very early in the morning over [[Arabia]] (and only [[penumbral]] over Anatolia and Syria), reaching its height over [[Central Asia]]:
:13 April 1308 BC, annular eclipse (94.8%), maximum at 04:16 UTC, {{coord|44.9|N|85.7|E}} ([[Tian Shan]]) and lasted 4 min 40 sec.

Other areas that had inside the band of the annular eclipse included the [[Indus River|Indus Delta]] and parts of [[Siberia]] including the [[New Siberian Islands]]. The maximum eclipse ended at sunset over the [[Beaufort Sea]] along with the [[Bering Sea]] and the westernmost portion of [[Alaska]] with the west of the [[Aleutian Islands]].  The eclipse covered much of Asia except for the southwesternmost portions and the southeastern islands, one of the islands that was near the edge of the eclipse was [[Honshū]], Japan.

[[Image:Rousseau theRepastOfTheLion.jpg|thumbnail|400px|[[Henri Rousseau]]'s ''[[The Repast of the Lion]]'' (circa 1907), is an example of naïve art.]]

'''Naïve art''' is any form of [[visual art]] that is created by a person who lacks the formal education and training that a professional artist undergoes (in anatomy, [[art history]], technique, [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], ways of seeing).&lt;ref name="Roberto"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Roberto |editor-first=K.

One particularly influential painter of "naïve art" was [[Henri Rousseau]] (1844–1910), a French [[Post-Impressionist]] who was discovered by [[Pablo Picasso]].

==Characteristics==
Naïve art&lt;ref&gt;Nathalia Brodskaïa ''L'Art naïf'' éd. Parkstone International {{ISBN|9781859956687}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often seen as [[outsider art]] that is by someone without formal (or little) training or degree.  While this was true before the twentieth century, there are now [[Art school|academies]] for naïve art. Naïve art is now a fully recognized art genre, represented in art galleries worldwide.

The characteristics of naïve art are an awkward relationship to the formal qualities of painting, especially not respecting the three rules of the perspective (such as defined by the ''Progressive Painters of the Renaissance''):
# Decrease of the size of objects proportionally with distance,
# Muting of colors with distance,
# Decrease of the precision of details with distance,
The results are:
# Effects of perspective geometrically erroneous (awkward aspect of the works, children's drawings look, or medieval painting look, but the comparison stops there)
#  Strong use of pattern, unrefined color on all the plans of the composition, without enfeeblement in the background,
# An equal accuracy brought to details, including those of the background which should be shaded off.
Simplicity rather than subtlety are all supposed markers of naïve art. It has, however, become such a popular and recognizable style that many examples could be called ''pseudo-naïve''.

Whereas naïve art ideally describes the work of an artist who did not receive  formal education in an [[art school]] or [[academy]], for example [[Henri Rousseau]] or [[Alfred Wallis]], 'pseudo naïve' or 'faux naïve' art describes the work of an artist working in a more imitative or self-conscious mode and whose work can be seen as more imitative than original.

Strict naïvety is unlikely to be found in contemporary artists, given the expansion of [[Autodidactism]] as a form of education in modern times. Naïve categorizations are not always welcome by living artists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Amy|title=Lure of the Naïve|url=http://amygellerillustration.com/assets/thesis.pdf|website=amygellerillustration.com/|accessdate=July 12, 2016|ref=page 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[translation|first1=[text] Natalia Brodskaia ;|last2=Darton]|first2=adaptation Mike|title=Naïve art|date=2000|publisher=Parkstone Press|location=New York|isbn=1859953352|page=74|url=https://www.amazon.com/Naive-Schools-Movements-Natalia-Brodskaya/dp/1859953352|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is likely to change as dignifying signals are known. Museums devoted to naïve art now exist in  [[Kecskemét]], [[Hungary]]; [[Riga, Latvia]]; [[Jaen, Spain]]; [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brasil]]; [[Musée d’art naïf de Vicq en Île-de-France|Vicq]] [[France]] and [[Paris]]. Examples of English-speaking living artists who acknowledge their naïve style are: Gary Bunt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gary Bunt, English Village Life|url=http://www.artistsandart.org/2009/10/gary-bunt-english-village-life.html|website=www.artistsandart.org|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyle Carbajal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lyle Carbajal: Painting|url=http://www.notey.com/@dailyartfixx_unofficial/external/1964452/lyle-carbajal-painting-%E2%80%94-daily-art-fixx-art-blog-modern-art-art-history-painting-illustration-photography-sculpture.html|website=www.notey.com|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Kis-Lev]], Gabe Langholtz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabe Langholtz Naive Modern|url=http://www.saatchiart.com/gabelangholtz|website=www.saatchiart.com|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gigi Mills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gigi Mills|url=http://www.askart.com/artist/Gigi_Mills/11201189/Gigi_Mills.aspx|website=www.askart.com|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Olsen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography Barbara Olsen|url=http://www.barbaraolsen.com/bio.htm|website=www.barbaraolsen.com|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paine Proffitt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Work: Paine Proffitt|url=http://www.acframinggallery.co.uk/artist/215/paine-proffitt|website=www.acframinggallery.co.uk|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alain Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alain THOMAS, an artist in the Garden of Eden|url=http://www.alain-thomas.com/uk/biographie.php|website=www.alain-thomas.com|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Primitive art" is another term often applied to art by those without formal training, but is historically more often applied to work from certain cultures that have been judged socially or technologically "primitive" by Western academia, such as Native American, subsaharan African or Pacific Island art (see [[Tribal art]]). This is distinguished from the self-conscious, "primitive" inspired movement [[primitivism (art)|primitivism]]. Another term related to (but not completely synonymous with) naïve art is [[folk art]].

There also exist the terms "naïvism" and "[[primitivism]]" which are usually applied to professional painters working in the style of naïve art (like [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zagraevsky.com/article2_engl.htm Irina Arnoldova. Painter Sergey Zagraevsky: the view of an art critic]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movements ==
Nobody knows exactly when the first naive artists appeared on the scene, as from the very first manifestations of art right up to the days of the "Modern Classic", naive artists quite unconsciously bequeathed us unmistakable signs of their creative activity. At all events, naive art can be regarded as having occupied an "official" position in the annals of twentieth-century art since - at the very latest - the publication of the ''Der Blaue Reiter'', an almanac in 1912. Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc, who brought out the almanac, presented 6 reproductions of paintings by ''le Douanier' Rousseau (Henri Rousseau)'', comparing them with other pictorial examples. However, most experts agree that the year that naive art was "discovered" was 1885, when the painter Paul Signac became aware of the talents of Henri Rousseau and set about organizing exhibitions of his work in a number of prestigious galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wetcanvas.com/Articles/Martens/naive_intro.html|title=WetCanvas: Articles: Jan and Adrie Martens: An Introduction to Naive Art|website=www.wetcanvas.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth Group ===
The [[Earth Group]] (''Grupa Zemlja'') were Croatian artists, [[architect]]s and intellectuals active in Zagreb from 1929 to 1935. The group was [[Marxist]] in orientation and was partly modelled on "[[Neue Sachlichkeit]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3.hu/ican.artnet.org/ican/text811a.html?id_text=60|title=I_CAN - Texts - page sent at 2005/04/13 17:54|website=www.c3.hu|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to more stylized forms, and the emergence of [[Naive painting]]. The group included the painters [[Krsto Hegedušić]], [[Edo Kovačević]], [[Omer Mujadžić]], [[Kamilo Ružička]], [[Ivan Tabaković]], and [[Oton Postružnik]], the sculptors [[Antun Augustinčić]], [[Frano Kršinić]], and the architect [[Drago Ibler]]. The Earth group searched for answers to social issues.  Their program emphasised the importance of independent creative expression, and opposed the uncritical copying of foreign styles. Rather than producing art for art's sake, they felt it ought to reflect the reality of life and the needs of the modern community. Activities at the group's exhibitions were increasingly provocative to the government of the day, and in 1935 the group was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3.hu/ican.artnet.org/ican/text811a.html?id_text=60|title=I_CAN - Texts - page sent at 2005/04/13 17:54|website=www.c3.hu|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hlebine School ===
A term applied to Croatian naive painters working in or around the village of Hlebine, near the Hungarian border, from about 1930. At this time, according to the World Encyclopedia of Naive Art (1984), the village amounted to little more than ‘a few muddy winding streets and one-storey houses’, but it produced such a remarkable crop of artists that it became virtually synonymous with Yugoslav naive painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hlebine School - oi|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095939383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hlebine]] is a small picturesque municipality in the North of Croatia that in 1920s became a setting against which a group of self-taught peasants began to develop a unique and somewhat revolutionary style of painting. This was instigated by leading intellectuals of the time such as the poet [[Antun Gustav Matoš]] and the biggest name in Croatian literature, [[Miroslav Krleža]], who called for an individual national artistic style that would be independent from Western influences. These ideas were picked up by a celebrated artist from Hlebine – [[Krsto Hegedušić]] and he went on to found the Hlebine School of Art in 1930 in search of national “rural artistic expression”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moonproject.co.uk/hlebine-school-of-art-more-than-peasant-doodles/|title=Hlebine School of Art: More than peasant doodles|website=MoonProject|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Generalić]] was the first master of the Hlebine School, and the first to develop a distinctive personal style, achieving a high standard in his art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmnu.org/en/vodic.asp|title=The Croatian Museum of Naive Art - Guide to the Permanent Display|last=Otvorena.hr|first=Otvorena mreza -|website=www.hmnu.org|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, the next generation of Hlebine painters tended to focus more on stylized depictions of country life taken from imagination. Generalić continued to be the dominant figure, and encouraged younger artists, including his son Josip Generalić.

The Hlebine school became a worldwide phenomenon with the 1952 Venice Biennale and exhibitions in Brazil and Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QujBgAAQBAJ|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Croatia|date=2015-04-07|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781465441737|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best known naive artists are   [[Dragan Gaži]],  [[Ivan Generalić]],  [[Josip Generalić]],  [[Krsto Hegedušić]],  [[Mijo Kovačić]], [[Ivan Lacković-Croata]],  [[Franjo Mraz]],  [[Ivan Večenaj]] and [[Mirko Virius]].

'''PCDitch''' is a dynamic aquatic [[ecosystem model]] used to study [[eutrophication]] effects in [[ditch]]es. PCDitch models the nutrient fluxes in the water, the sediment and the vegetation, as well as the competition between different groups of vegetation. PCDitch is used both by scientists and water quality managers{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

==Background==

As a result of [[intensive agriculture]] in [[drainage basin|catchment areas]], many [[polder]] ditches have turned from a clear water state with submerged plant dominance into a state where the water is completely covered with duckweed. Dominance of free-floating plants poses a threat to biodiversity by causing dark an [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions in the water column, and is generally associated with poor ecological quality{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. 

==Application==
PCDitch predicts the existence of a 'critical nutrient load' above which one may expect duckweed coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 1998, A model of ditch vegetation in relation to eutrophication. Water Science &amp; Technology 37: 139-149&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be used by water resource managers to estimate the critical nutrient loading for ditch systems,&lt;ref&gt;Van Liere L, JH Janse &amp; GHP Arts, 2007. Setting critical nutrient values for ditches with the eutrophication model PCDitch. Aquatic Ecology 41: 443–449&lt;/ref&gt; and to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration measures such as nutrient loading reductions. A meta-model has also been developed &lt;ref&gt;http://themasites.pbl.nl/modellen/pcditch/&lt;/ref&gt; for use by water managers to derive an estimate of the critical nutrient loading based on only a few key parameters, without any need to run the full dynamic model.&lt;ref&gt;Witteveen+Bos (in Dutch) 2013. Metamodel PCDitch. Witteveen+Bos, rapport nr. STO 170-1. http://edepot.wur.nl/286383&lt;/ref&gt; PCDitch is also used by scientists to investigate the more general effects of eutrophication in ditch ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;Janse, JH &amp; PJTM Van Puijenbroek, 1998. Effects of eutrophication in drainage ditches. Environmental Pollution 102: 547-552&lt;/ref&gt; or to study the competition between different aquatic plant species.

==Model content==
In essence PCDitch is a set of coupled [[ordinary differential equation]]s. With more than 40 [[state variables]] and more than 400 [[parameters]] the model is considered fairly complex{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. The model describes a completely mixed water body comprising the water column and the upper sediment layer. The overall [[nutrient cycle]]s for nitrogen and phosphorus are described as completely closed (except for in- and outflow, [[denitrification]] and burial). Inputs to the model are: water inflow, evaporation, nutrient loading, light intensity, water temperature, sediment characteristics and depth of the ditch. Six functional groups of water plants are modelled: floating-leaved plants, emerged plants, non-rooted floating plants, non-rooted submerged [[flowering plant]]s, rooted submerged flowering plants, [[Charophyta|Charophytes]], and one phytoplankton group.
 
The default configuration of PCDitch does not take spatial heterogeneity into account. However, PCDitch can be coupled with spatial explicit hydrodynamical models to model networks of ditches{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.
Although PCDitch is primarily used for Dutch ditches, the model can be applied to other non-[[stratification (water)|stratifying]] freshwater ecosystems where competition between primary producers is a key determinant of ecosystem functioning, if parameters are adjusted or some small changes to the model are made{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.
PCDitch was calibrated with data of experimental ditches with sand and clay sediments that were exposed to different nutrient loading treatments{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. As phosphorus in PCDitch is related with aluminium, iron, lutum content (sediment particles smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;µm), [[porosity]] and [[organic matter]] content in de sediment, it is assumed that the model can also be used to describe peat ditches.

==Model development==
PCDitch is the twin-model of [[PCLake]], which is an ecosystem model for shallow lakes. Both models were developed by Dr. Jan H. Janse and colleagues at the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] (PBL), formerly part of the [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] (RIVM).&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 2005. Model studies on the eutrophication of shallow lakes and ditches. PhD thesis. Wageningen University&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2009, the model has been jointly owned by PBL and Wageningen University &amp; Research Centre, where further development and application of the model is taking place{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

It has been introduced in 2001 by Lions, Maday and Turinici. Since then, it has become one of the most widely studied parallel-in-time integration methods {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

== Parallel-in-time integration methods ==

In contrast to e.g. [[Runge–Kutta methods|Runge-Kutta]] or [[Linear multistep method|multi-step]] methods, some of the computations in Parareal can be performed [[Parallel computing|in parallel]] and
Parareal is therefore one example of a ''parallel-in-time'' integration method.
While historically most efforts to parallelize the [[Numerical partial differential equations|numerical solution]] of [[partial differential equation]]s focussed on the spatial discretization, in view of the challenges from [[exascale computing]], parallel methods for [[temporal discretization]] have been identified as a possible way to increase concurrency in [[List of numerical analysis software|numerical software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

Because Parareal computes the numerical solution for multiple time steps in parallel, it is categorized as a ''parallel across the steps'' method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== History ==

Parareal can be derived as both a [[multigrid method]] in time method or as [[Direct multiple shooting method|multiple shooting]] along the time axis.&lt;ref name="gander2007"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;math&gt; \dot{y}(t) = f(y(t), t), \quad y(t_0) = y_0 \quad \text{with} \quad t_0 \leq t \leq T.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the right hand side &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can correspond to the spatial discretization of a partial differential equation in a [[method of lines]] approach.

Parareal now requires a [[Domain decomposition methods|decomposition]] of the time interval &lt;math&gt;[t_0, T]&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; so-called time slices &lt;math&gt;[t_j, t_{j+1}]&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt; [t_0, T] = [t_0, t_1] \cup [t_1, t_2] \cup \ldots \cup [t_{P-1}, t_{P} ].&lt;/math&gt;

Each time slice is assigned to one processing unit when parallelizing the algorithm, so that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number of processing units used for Parareal: in an [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] based code for example, this would be the number of processes, while in an [[OpenMP]] based code, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; would be equal to the number of [[Thread (computing)|threads]].

Parareal is based on the iterative application of two methods for [[Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations|integration of ordinary differential equations]].
One, commonly labelled &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, should be of high accuracy and computational cost while the other, typically labelled &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;, must be computationally cheap but can be much less accurate. 
Typically, some form of Runge-Kutta method is chosen for both coarse and fine integrator, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; might be of lower order and use a larger time step than &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.
If the initial value problem stems from the discretization of a PDE, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; can also use a coarser spatial discretization, but this can negatively impact convergence unless high order interpolation is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruprecht|first=Daniel|date=2014-12-01|title=Convergence of Parareal with spatial coarsening|journal=PAMM|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1031–1034|doi=10.1002/pamm.201410490|issn=1617-7061|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/90536/1/paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The result of numerical integration with one of these methods over a time slice &lt;math&gt;[t_{j}, t_{j+1}]&lt;/math&gt; for some starting value &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt; given at &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; is then written as

&lt;math&gt; y = \mathcal{F}(y_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) &lt;/math&gt;   or   &lt;math&gt;y = \mathcal{G}(y_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) &lt;/math&gt;.

Serial time integration with the fine method would then correspond to a step-by-step computation of

&lt;math&gt; y_{j+1} = \mathcal{F}(y_j, t_j, t_{j+1}), \quad j=0, \ldots, P-1.&lt;/math&gt;

Parareal instead uses the following iteration

&lt;math&gt; y_{j+1}^{k+1} = \mathcal{G}(y^{k+1}_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) + \mathcal{F}(y^k_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) - \mathcal{G}(y^k_j, t_j, t_{j+1}), \quad j=0, \ldots, P-1, \quad k=0, \ldots, K-1,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the iteration counter. 
As the iteration converges and &lt;math&gt;y^{k+1}_j - y^k_j \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, the terms from the coarse method cancel out and Parareal reproduces the solution that is obtained by the serial execution of the fine method only.
It can be shown that Parareal converges after a maximum of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; iterations.&lt;ref name="gander2007" /&gt;
For Parareal to provide speedup, however, it has to converge in a number of iterations significantly smaller than the number of time slices, that is &lt;math&gt;K \ll P&lt;/math&gt;.

In the Parareal iteration, the computationally expensive evaluation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(y^k_j, t_j, t_{j+1})&lt;/math&gt; can be performed in parallel on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; processing units.
By contrast, the dependency of &lt;math&gt;y^{k+1}_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}(y^{k+1}_j, t_j, t_{j+1})&lt;/math&gt; means that the coarse correction has to be computed in serial order.

===Speedup===
Under some assumptions, a simple theoretical model for the [[Amdahl's law|speedup]] of Parareal can be derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last       = Minion
| first      = Michael L.

| doi        = 10.2140/camcos.2010.5.265
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although in applications these assumptions can be too restrictive, the model still is useful to illustrate the trade offs that are involved in obtaining speedup with Parareal.

First, assume that every time slice &lt;math&gt;[t_j, t_{j+1}]&lt;/math&gt; consists of exactly &lt;math&gt;N_f&lt;/math&gt; steps of the fine integrator and of &lt;math&gt;N_c&lt;/math&gt; steps of the coarse integrator.
This includes in particular the assumption that all time slices are of identical length and that both coarse and fine integrator use a constant step size over the full simulation.
Second, denote by &lt;math&gt;\tau_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; the computing time required for a single step of the fine and coarse methods, respectively, and assume that both are constant.
This is typically not exactly true when an [[Temporal discretization#Implicit Time Integration|implicit]] method is used, because then runtimes vary depending on the number of iterations required by the [[Iterative method|iterative solver]].

Under these two assumptions, the runtime for the fine method integrating over &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; time slices can be modelled as

&lt;math&gt; c_{\text{fine}} = P N_{f} \tau_f. &lt;/math&gt;

The runtime of Parareal using &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; processing units and performing &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; iterations is

&lt;math&gt; c_{\text{parareal}} = (K+1) P N_{c} \tau_c + K N_{f} \tau_f. &lt;/math&gt;

Speedup of Parareal then is

&lt;math&gt; S_{p} = \frac{c_{\text{fine}}}{c_{\text{parareal}}} = \frac{1}{ (K+1) \frac{N_c}{N_f} \frac{\tau_c}{\tau_f} + \frac{K}{P}} \leq \min\left\{ \frac{N_f \tau_f}{N_c \tau_c}, \frac{P}{K}  \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

These two bounds illustrate the trade off that has to be made in choosing the coarse method: on the one hand, it has to be cheap and/or use a much larger time step to make the first bound as large as possible, on the other hand the number of iterations &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has to be kept low to keep the second bound large.
In particular, [[Speedup#Additional Details|Parareal's parallel efficiency]] is bounded by

&lt;math&gt; E_{p} = \frac{S_p}{P} \leq \frac{1}{K},&lt;/math&gt;

that is by the inverse of the number of required iterations.

=== Instability for imaginary eigenvalues ===
The vanilla version of Parareal has issues for problems with imaginary [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]].&lt;ref name="gander2007" /&gt; It typically only converges toward the very last iterations, that is as &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and the speedup &lt;math&gt; S_p&lt;/math&gt; is always going to be smaller than one.  So either the number of iterations is small and Parareal is unstable or, if &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is large enough to make Parareal stable, no speedup is possible. This also means that Parareal is typically unstable for [[Hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic]] equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stability of the Parareal Algorithm|last=Staff|first=Gunnar Andreas|last2=Rønquist|first2=Einar M.|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540225232|editor-last=Barth|editor-first=Timothy J.|series=Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering|pages=449–456|language=en|doi=10.1007/3-540-26825-1_46|editor-last2=Griebel|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last3=Keyes|editor-first3=David E.|editor-last4=Nieminen|editor-first4=Risto M.|editor-last5=Roose|editor-first5=Dirk|editor-last6=Schlick|editor-first6=Tamar|editor-last7=Kornhuber|editor-first7=Ralf|editor-last8=Hoppe|editor-first8=Ronald|editor-last9=Périaux|editor-first9=Jacques}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the formal analysis by Gander and Vandewalle covers only linear problems with constant coefficients, the problem also arises when Parareal is applied to the nonlinear [[Navier-stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]] when the [[viscosity]] coefficient becomes too small and the [[Reynolds number]] too large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Convergence of Parareal for the Navier-Stokes Equations Depending on the Reynolds Number|last=Steiner|first=Johannes|last2=Ruprecht|first2=Daniel|last3=Speck|first3=Robert|last4=Krause|first4=Rolf|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319107042|editor-last=Abdulle|editor-first=Assyr|series=Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering|pages=195–202|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-10705-9_19|editor-last2=Deparis|editor-first2=Simone|editor-last3=Kressner|editor-first3=Daniel|editor-last4=Nobile|editor-first4=Fabio|editor-last5=Picasso|editor-first5=Marco|citeseerx = 10.1.1.764.6242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different approaches exist to stabilise Parareal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dai|first=X.|last2=Maday|first2=Y.|date=2013-01-01|title=Stable Parareal in Time Method for First- and Second-Order Hyperbolic Systems|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|volume=35|issue=1|pages=A52–A78|doi=10.1137/110861002|issn=1064-8275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farhat|first=Charbel|last2=Cortial|first2=Julien|last3=Dastillung|first3=Climène|last4=Bavestrello|first4=Henri|date=2006-07-30|title=Time-parallel implicit integrators for the near-real-time prediction of linear structural dynamic responses|journal=International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering|language=en|volume=67|issue=5|pages=697–724|doi=10.1002/nme.1653|issn=1097-0207|bibcode=2006IJNME..67..697F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Use of Reduced Basis Methods to Accelerate and Stabilize the Parareal Method|last=Chen|first=Feng|last2=Hesthaven|first2=Jan S.|last3=Zhu|first3=Xueyu|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319020891|editor-last=Quarteroni|editor-first=Alfio|series=MS&amp;A - Modeling, Simulation and Applications|pages=187–214|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-02090-7_7|editor-last2=Rozza|editor-first2=Gianluigi|url = http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/190666}}&lt;/ref&gt; one being Krylov-subspace enhanced Parareal.

== Variants ==
There are multiple algorithms that are directly based or at least inspired by the original Parareal algorithm.

=== Krylov-subspace enhanced Parareal ===
Early on it was recognised that for linear problems information generated by the fine method &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\delta t}&lt;/math&gt; can be used to improve the accuracy of the coarse method &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Originally, the idea was formulated for the parallel implicit time-integrator PITA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farhat|first=Charbel|last2=Chandesris|first2=Marion|date=2003-11-07|title=Time-decomposed parallel time-integrators: theory and feasibility studies for fluid, structure, and fluid–structure applications|journal=International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering|language=en|volume=58|issue=9|pages=1397–1434|doi=10.1002/nme.860|issn=1097-0207|bibcode=2003IJNME..58.1397F}}&lt;/ref&gt; a method closely related to Parareal but with small differences in how the correction is done. In every iteration &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; the result &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\delta t}(y^k_j)&lt;/math&gt; is computed for values &lt;math&gt;u^k_j \in \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=0, \ldots, P-1&lt;/math&gt;. Based on this information, the [[Vector space|subspace]]

&lt;math&gt;
S_k := \left\{ y^{k'}_j : 0 \leq k' \leq k, j=0, \ldots, P-1 \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

is defined and updated after every Parareal iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gander|first=M.|last2=Petcu|first2=M.|title=Analysis of a Krylov subspace enhanced parareal algorithm for linear problems|journal=ESAIM: Proceedings|volume=25|pages=114–129|doi=10.1051/proc:082508|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denote as &lt;math&gt; P_k&lt;/math&gt; the [[orthogonal projection]] from &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; S_k&lt;/math&gt;. Then, replace the coarse method with the improved integrator &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{K}_{\Delta t}(y) = \mathcal{F}_{\delta t}(P_k y) + \mathcal{G}_{\Delta t}((I-P_k)y)&lt;/math&gt;.

As the number of iterations increases, the space &lt;math&gt; S_k&lt;/math&gt; will grow and the modified propagator &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{K}_{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt; will become more accurate. This will lead to faster convergence. This version of Parareal can also stably integrate linear hyperbolic partial differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruprecht|first=D.|last2=Krause|first2=R.|date=2012-04-30|title=Explicit parallel-in-time integration of a linear acoustic-advection system|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045793012000709|journal=Computers &amp; Fluids|volume=59|pages=72–83|doi=10.1016/j.compfluid.2012.02.015|arxiv=1510.02237}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extension to nonlinear problems based on the reduced basis method exists as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Hybrid Parareal spectral deferred corrections ===
A method with improved parallel efficiency based on a combination of Parareal with spectral deferred corrections (SDC) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutt|first=Alok|last2=Greengard|first2=Leslie|last3=Rokhlin|first3=Vladimir|date=2000-06-01|title=Spectral Deferred Correction Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations|journal=BIT Numerical Mathematics|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=241–266|doi=10.1023/A:1022338906936|issn=0006-3835}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed by M. Minion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minion|first=Michael|date=2011-01-05|title=A hybrid parareal spectral deferred corrections method|url=http://msp.org/camcos/2010/5-2/p05.xhtml|journal=Communications in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science|volume=5|issue=2|pages=265–301|doi=10.2140/camcos.2010.5.265|issn=2157-5452}}&lt;/ref&gt; It limits the choice for coarse and fine integrator to SDC, sacrificing flexibility for improved parallel efficiency. Instead of the limit of &lt;math&gt;1/K&lt;/math&gt;, the bound on parallel efficiency in the hybrid method becomes

&lt;math&gt;E_p \leq \frac{K_s}{K_p}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;K_s&lt;/math&gt; being the number of iterations of the serial SDC base method and &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; the typically greater number of iterations of the parallel hybrid method. The Parareal-SDC hybrid has been further improved by addition of a ''full approximation scheme''  as used in nonlinear [[Multigrid method|multigrid]]. This led to the development of the ''parallel full approximation scheme in space and time'' (PFASST).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emmett|first=Matthew|last2=Minion|first2=Michael|date=2012-03-28|title=Toward an efficient parallel in time method for partial differential equations|url=http://msp.org/camcos/2012/7-1/p04.xhtml|journal=Communications in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science|volume=7|issue=1|pages=105–132|doi=10.2140/camcos.2012.7.105|issn=2157-5452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance of PFASST has been studied for PEPC, a [[Barnes–Hut simulation|Barnes-Hut]] tree code based particle solver developed at [[Jülich Supercomputing Centre|Juelich Supercomputing Centre]].

=== Multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) ===
The multigrid reduction in time method (MGRIT) generalises the interpretation of Parareal as a multigrid-in-time algorithms to multiple levels using different smoothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falgout|first=R.|last2=Friedhoff|first2=S.|last3=Kolev|first3=T.|last4=MacLachlan|first4=S.|last5=Schroder|first5=J.|date=2014-01-01|title=Parallel Time Integration with Multigrid|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|volume=36|issue=6|pages=C635–C661|doi=10.1137/130944230|issn=1064-8275|citeseerx=10.1.1.701.2603}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a more general approach but for a specific choice of parameters it is equivalent to Parareal. The [http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/parallel-time-integration-multigrid XBraid] library implementing MGRIT is being developed by [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].

=== ParaExp ===
ParaExp uses [[exponential integrator]]s within Parareal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gander|first=M.|last2=Güttel|first2=S.|date=2013-01-01|title=PARAEXP: A Parallel Integrator for Linear Initial-Value Problems|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|volume=35|issue=2|pages=C123–C142|doi=10.1137/110856137|issn=1064-8275|citeseerx=10.1.1.800.5938}}&lt;/ref&gt; While limited to linear problems, it can produce almost optimal parallel speedup.

'''The Pirbright Institute''' (formerly the '''Institute for Animal Health''') is a [[research institute]] in [[Surrey]], England, dedicated to the study of [[infectious disease]]s of [[livestock|farm animals]]. It forms part of the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government's]] [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC). The Institute employs scientists, vets, PhD students and operations staff.

==History==
It began in 1914 to test cows for [[tuberculosis]]. More buildings were added in 1925. Compton was established by the [[Agricultural Research Council]] in 1937. Pirbright became a research institute in 1939 and Compton in 1942. The Houghton Poultry Research Station at [[Houghton, Cambridgeshire]] was established in 1948. In 1963 Pirbright became the Animal Virus Research Institute and Compton became the Institute for Research on Animal Diseases. The Neuropathogenesis Unit (NPU) was established in Edinburgh in 1981. This became part of the [[Roslin Institute]] in 2007.

In 1987, Compton, Houghton and Pirbright became the Institute for Animal Health, being funded by BBSRC. Houghton closed in 1992, operations at Compton are being rapidly wound down with the site due to close in 2015.

The [[Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research]] was sited at Compton until October 2005.

Significant investment (over £170 million) is taking place at Pirbright with the development of new world class laboratory and animal facilities. The Institute has been known as "The Pirbright Institute" since October 2012.

==Structure==
The work previously carried out at Compton has either moved out to the university sector, ended or has been transferred to the Pirbright Site. The Compton site currently carries out work on [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] (commonplace) animal diseases including some Avian Viruses and a small amount of Bovine Immunology whilst Pirbright works on exotic (unusual) [[animal diseases]] (usually caused by virus outbreaks). Pirbright has National and International Reference Laboratories of diseases.

===Funding===
25% of its income comes from a core grant from the BBSRC of around £11m.  Around 50% comes from research grants from related government organisations, such as DEFRA, or industry and charities (such as the [[Wellcome Trust]]). The remaining 25% comes from direct payments for work carried out.

==Function==
The Pirbright Institute carries out research, diagnostics and surveillance [[Animal virology|viruses]] carried by animals, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), African swine fever, bluetongue, lumpy skin disease and avian and swine flu  [[Livestock|farm animal]]s.  Understanding of viruses comes from [[molecular biology]].

It carries out surveillance activities on farm animal health and disease movement in the UK.

== Location ==
The Institute had two sites at:
* [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] in [[Berkshire]] - This was closed in early 2016 and services relocated to Pirbright where new facilities had been constructed.
* [[Pirbright]] in [[Surrey]] — shared with commercial company [[Merial]]

A '''process-data diagram (PDD)''', also known as '''process-deliverable diagram''' is a [[diagram]] that describes [[process (computing)|process]]es and [[data]] that act as output of these processes. On the left side the [[meta-process model]] can be viewed and on the right side the [[metadata modeling|meta-data model]] can be viewed.&lt;ref name="WSVB"&gt;I. Van de Weerd, J. Souer, J. Versendaal and [[Sjaak Brinkkemper]] (2005). ''Situational Requirements Engineering of Web Content Management Implementations''. SREP2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A process-data diagram can be seen as combination of a [[business process model]] and [[data model]].

== Overview ==
[[Image:SAP Implementation process-data diagram.png|240px|right|thumbnail|SAP Implementation process-data diagram]] 
The process-data diagram that is depicted at the right, gives an overview of all of these activities/processes and deliverables. The four gray boxes depict the four main [[implementation]] phases, which each contain several processes that are in this case all sequential. The boxes at the right show all the deliverables/[[concept]]s that result from the processes. Boxes without a shadow have no further sub-concepts. Boxes with a black shadow depict complex closed concepts, so concepts that have sub-concepts, which however will not be described in any more detail. Boxes with a white shadow (a box behind it) depict open closed concepts, where the sub-concepts are expanded in greater detail. The lines with diamonds show a has-a relationship between concepts.

The [[SAP Implementation]] process is made up out of four main phases, i.e. the project preparation where a vision of the future-state of the SAP solution is being created, a sizing and blueprinting phase where a [[solution stack|software stack]] is acquired and [[training]] is being performuued, a functional development phase and finally a final preparation phase, when the last [[Software testing|tests]] are being performed before the actual go live. For each phase, the vital activities are addressed and the [[deliverable]]s/[[Product (business)|product]]s are explained.

== Process-data diagram building blocks ==

=== Sequential activities ===
{{main article|Activity diagram}}
Sequential activities are activities that need to be carried out in a pre-defined order. The activities are connected with an arrow, implying that they have to be followed in that sequence. Both activities and sub-activities can be modeled in a sequential way. In Figure 1 an activity diagram is illustrated with one activity and two sequential sub-activities. A special kind of sequential activities are the start and stop states, which are also illustrated in Figure 1.

In Figure 2 an example from practice is illustrated. The example is taken from the requirements capturing workflow in UML-based Web Engineering. The main activity, user &amp; domain modeling, consists of three activities that need to be carried out in a predefined order.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Process-Data Diagram 21.gif|1: Sequential activities
Image:Process-Data Diagram 22.gif|2: Example 
Image:Process-Data Diagram 23.gif|3: Unordered activities
Image:Process-Data Diagram 24.gif|4: Example  
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Unordered activities ===
Unordered activities are used when sub-activities of an activity do not have a pre-defined sequence in which they need to be carried out. Only sub-activities can be unordered. Unordered activities are represented as sub-activities without transitions within an activity, as is represented in Figure 3.

Sometimes an activity consists of both sequential and unordered sub-activities. The solution to this modeling issue is to divide the main activity in different parts. In Figure 4 an example is illustrated, which clarifies the necessity to be able to model unordered activities. The example is taken from the requirements analysis workflow of the Unified Process. The main activity, “describe candidate requirements”, is divided into two parts. The first part is a sequential activity. The second part consists of four activities that do not need any sequence in order to be carried out correctly.

=== Concurrent activities ===
Activities can occur concurrently. This is handled with forking and joining. By drawing the activities parallel in the diagram, connected with a synchronization bar, one can fork several activities. Later on these concurrent activities can join again by using the same synchronization bar. Both activities and sub-activities can occur concurrently. In the example of Figure 5, Activity 2 and Activity 3 are concurrent activities.

In Figure 6, a fragment of a requirements capturing process is depicted. Two activities, defining the actors and defining the use cases, are carried out concurrently. The reason for carrying out these activities concurrently is that defining the actors influences the use cases greatly, and vice versa.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Process-Data Diagram 25.gif|5: Concurrent activities
Image:Process-Data Diagram 26.gif|6: Example 
Image:Process-Data Diagram 27.gif|7: Conditional activities
Image:Process-Data Diagram 28.gif|8: Example 
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Conditional activities ===
Conditional activities are activities that are only carried out if a pre-defined condition is met. This is graphically represented by using a branch. Branches are illustrated with a diamond and can have incoming and outgoing transitions. Every outgoing transition has a guard expression, the condition. This guard expression is actually a Boolean expression, used to make a choice which direction to go. Both activities and sub-activities can be modeled as conditional activities. In Figure 7 two conditional activities are illustrated.

In Figure 8 an example from practice is illustrated. A requirements analysis starts with studying the material. Based on this study, the decision is taken whether to do an extensive requirements elicitation session or not. The condition for not carrying out this requirements session is represented at the left of the branch, namely [requirements clear]. If this condition is not met, [else], the other arrow is followed.

The integration of both types of diagrams is quite straightforward. Each action or activity results in a concept. They are connected with a dotted arrow to the produced artifacts, as is demonstrated in Figure 9.  The concepts and activities are abstract in this picture.

::[[Image:Mm41.gif|frame|left|Figure 9: Process-Data Diagram]]{{clear|left}}

In Table 1 a generic table is presented with the description of activities, sub-activities and their relations to the concepts. In section 5 examples are given of both process-data diagram and activity table.

== Example of a process-data diagram ==
In Figure 10 an example of a process-data diagram is illustrated. It concerns an example from the orientation phase of complex project in a WebEngineering method.&lt;ref name="WSVB"/&gt;

Notable is the use of open and closed concepts. Since project management is actually not within the scope of this research, the concept CONTROL MANAGEMENT has not been expanded. However, in a complex project is RISK MANAGEMENT of great importance. Therefore, the choice is made to expand the RISK MANAGEMENT concept.

"'''Red Hill Mining Town'''" is a song by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. It is the sixth track from their 1987 album, ''[[The Joshua Tree]]''. A rough version of this song was worked on during the early ''Joshua Tree'' album writing sessions in 1985. The focus of the song is on the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]]' [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|1984 strike in Great Britain]] that occurred in response to the [[National Coal Board]]'s campaign to close uneconomic mines. A music video was produced in February 1987 for the song and was directed by Neil Jordan. The song was planned for release as the album's second single, but it was ultimately shelved in favour of "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]".

A new mix of the song by producer [[Steve Lillywhite]] was released as a single in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/u2-red-hill-mining-town-new-version-2053226|title=Listen to U2’s new version of ‘Red Hill Mining Town’|work=[[NME]]|date=17 April 2017|accessdate=23 April 2017|first=Sam|last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and recording==
In 1984, the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], aggressively opposed by the government led by [[Margaret Thatcher]], declared [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|a strike]] in response to the British [[National Coal Board]]'s decision to close down a large swathe of the United Kingdom's coal mines, which had become unprofitable. The civil discord created by the dispute, both politically, socially, and in violent confrontations between trade [[picketing|union pickets]] and the United Kingdom's police forces in the affected areas, was one of the most divisive and bitter civic conflicts in Britain in the 20th Century, and its societal and economic impact on the working class coal-mining based communities in Wales, across the English Midlands and the North was severe.&lt;ref name="stokes"&gt;{{cite book | first = Niall | last = Stokes | authorlink = Niall Stokes | title = Into The Heart: The Stories Behind Every U2 Song | publisher = [[HarperCollins]] Publishers | year = 1996 | location = London | isbn = 0-00-719668-7 | page = 71 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LCcuuWbemcAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1984, [[Bob Dylan]] played at [[Slane Castle]] in [[Ireland]]. U2 singer [[Bono]] interviewed him for ''[[Hot Press]]'' magazine and Dylan invited Bono to sing on stage with him. The meeting confirmed for Bono, whose "record collection started in 1976", how much he still had to learn about the traditions of singing, songwriting, and musicianship.&lt;ref name="stokes" /&gt; A friendship developed between Bono and Dylan with Bono delving into Dylan's back catalogue and retracing the connections between Irish and American folk music. He was also listening to the blue-collar labour songs of [[Bruce Springsteen]]. U2's growing awareness of folk traditions was reflected in their performance at a 25th anniversary tribute on ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' to folk veterans [[the Dubliners]]. U2 performed [[Peggy Seeger]]'s "[[Springhill Mining Disaster]]" which tells the story of a mining disaster in [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name="stokes" /&gt;

These strands came together in "Red Hill Mining Town", a rough version of which was worked up during the early ''Joshua Tree'' album writing sessions in late 1985.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Bono's lyrics focused on the stress the dispute had on families and their relationships, many of which broke down.&lt;ref name="complete-guide"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Graham | first1 = Bill | first2 = Caroline | last2 = van Oosten de Boer | title = U2: The Complete Guide to their Music | publisher = [[Omnibus Press]] | year = 2004 | location = London | pages = 33–34 |  isbn = 0-7119-9886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, inspiration was drawn from the [[Tony Parker (author)|Tony Parker]] book ''Red Hill: A Mining Community''. Bono was criticised in some quarters for not being politically specific enough. However, Bono said he felt he was more interested in the relationships and that others were more qualified to comment on the strike itself.&lt;ref name="stokes" /&gt;

During recording, Bono was displeased with an early vocal take and wondered why his voice made him sound "like a rich man with pound notes stuffed in his pockets when it's a song about unemployment". The [[audio engineering|audio engineer]] determined that the stereo [[plate reverb]] effect that had been added to the vocals was contributing to this feeling, and as a result, it was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Expression in Pop-Rock Music: A Collection of Critical and Analytical Essays (Studies in Contemporary Music and Culture) |first=Walter |last=Everett |chapter=Music, Contexts, and Meaning in U2 |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |pages=55 |isbn=978-0-8153-3160-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, U2 were not completely satisfied with the final result; producer [[Steve Lillywhite]], who [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] the track, said, "It never got finished the way they wanted it. They always thought it could be a little bit better." One of the issues was that the [[brass instrument|brass]] accompaniment played by the Arklow Silver Band was considered [[Musical tuning#Tuning practice|out of tune]]. As a result, Lillywhite was to told to raise the synthesiser track in the mix, as "in 1986, we were very impressed that you could get really good sounding brass instruments out of a keyboard."&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/u2-red-hill-mining-town-steve-lillywhite-mix-1202456781/|title=Bono ‘Hated the Singer’: Producer Steve Lillywhite on Revisiting U2’s ‘Red Hill Mining Town’|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|first=Shirley|last=Halperin|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 mix===
For the 30th anniversary reissue of ''The Joshua Tree'' in 2017, new mixes of several songs were created, including "Red Hill Mining Town". The 2017 mix of the song was worked on using [[Stem (audio)|stems]] from the original recording; the band and Lillywhite communicated over e-mail, as the producer was residing in Indonesia. Looking back on the original mix, Lillywhite believed it was a mistake to de-emphasize the brass, saying of the synthesiser, "yes it's a good sound, but sometimes the sound is not as important as the spirit." Since the brass was recorded on just two [[Multitrack recording|tracks]], Lillywhite could not [[Auto-Tune]] the recording. Instead, he turned up the horns based on a recommendation that [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Keith Richards]] made 30 years earlier. Whenever Richards' guitar would get out of tune over the course of a take, instead of lowering the instrument in the mix and covering it with an [[overdubbing|overdub]], he would turn it up so that it, despite sounding out of tune, would "own the sound". Describing the new mix of "Red Hill Mining Town", Lillywhite said, "the brass band is much more emotive than someone playing it on a keyboard".&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

Other changes for the new mix were complicated by audio [[Spill (audio)|spill]]; U2 had recorded the song as a single studio performance, resulting in the drums leaking onto the track for the bass guitar amplifier. Guitarist [[the Edge]] asked Lillywhite to raise the guitar in the mix. Bono, believing he could sing the song better and with more sincerity, told Lillywhite, "I hate the singer", and subsequently re-recorded his vocals for the verses. Lillywhite said, "I actually had to match a 56-year-old Bono with a 26-year-old Bono and they mixed well. I was very happy. It's quite powerful sounding."&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

==Aborted single release and live performances==
A [[music video]] for the song was produced in February 1987 in London and directed by [[Neil Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;McGee (2008), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed on a set representing an underground mine.  The video was included on the bonus DVD of the 20th Anniversary Super Deluxe Box reissue of ''The Joshua Tree''.

The song was initially planned for release as ''The Joshua Tree''{{'}}s second single, but U2 were unhappy with the video and Bono was unable to sing the high notes during pre-[[Joshua Tree Tour]] rehearsals. The song was dropped as a single and "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]" became a late choice for the second single.&lt;ref&gt;McGee (2008), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; U2 drummer [[Larry Mullen Jr.]] later described it as "one of the lost songs" and that while he thought it had had great potential, it was "over-produced and under-written". While Bono had clear ideas on how he wanted it to sound during ''The Joshua Tree'' sessions, Mullen recalls that the rest of the band and production crew were "[not] sure where he was going with it."&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

For 30 years it was known as the only song from ''The Joshua Tree'' never to be played live,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/4269254.html|title=The Secret History of 'The Joshua Tree' |work=[[Hot Press]] |first=Colm |last=O'Hare |date=21 November 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was soundchecked in November 1987.&lt;ref&gt;U2gigs.com, [http://www.u2gigs.com/show954.html U2 live on 28 November 1987, Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, the band embarked on [[the Joshua Tree Tour 2017]], playing the album in its entirety, and as a result, the song was played live for the first time.

==Critical reception==
Bill Graham of ''[[Hot Press]]'' contrasted the song with two of the album's other [[ballad]]s, "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" and "[[Running to Stand Still]]", describing it as the album's "most cluttered and literal, least mysterious and open-ended track". He said the blocked harmonies show the band "striving too ambitiously and conventionally for effect" and likened the song to a "scarf-waving variant of '[[Sailing (Rod Stewart song)|Sailing]]' written for the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]]". He described the melody, however, as "undeniably potent and infectious", and he praised the band's good intentions in writing about the mining strikes.&lt;ref name="complete-guide" /&gt; [[Niall Stokes]] said that the song "capture[ed] eloquently [...] the sense of doom that surrounded the death of the small close-knit mining communities".&lt;ref name="stokes" /&gt;

[[Image:RostamMournsSohrab.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Persian language|Persian]] manuscript painting:Rustam laments for Suhrab]]

The tragedy of '''  Rostam and Sohrab''' forms part of the 10th-century Persian epic [[Shahnameh]] by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet]] [[Ferdowsi]]. It tells the tragic story of the heroes [[Rostam]] and his son, [[Sohrab]].

==Plot==
Rostam lived in [[Sistan]], [[Iran]] (also known as [[Persia]]), hero and one of the favorites of King [[Kay Kāvus|Kaykavous]]. Once, following the traces of his lost horse, he enters the kingdom of [[Samangan]] where he becomes the guest of the king during the search for his horse. There, Rostam meets princess [[Tahmina]]. She admires Rostam and knows of his reputation. She goes into his room at night and asks if he will give her a child and in return, she will bring his horse. Rostam leaves after he impregnates Tahmina and his horse is returned. Before he leaves, he gives her two tokens. If she has a girl, she is to take the jewel and plait it in the girl's hair. If she has a boy, she is to take the seal and bind it on the boy's arm. Nine months later, she bears his child—a son, whom she later names Sohrab. Years go by before Rostam and Sohrab meet. Finally, a new war between [[Persia]] and [[Turan]] is on the horizon. The two armies face each other and prepare for the imminent battle. By then, Sohrab has become known as the best fighter of Turan army. But Rostam's legend precedes him and the Turan army cowers before the hero. No one else dares to fight Rostam, so Sohrab is sent to wrestle with the legendary Khurasaan hero. Though Sohrab knows his father's name, he is unaware that the man before him is Rostam. On the battlefield, Rostam and Sohrab fight for what seems like an eternity, neither knowing the true name of his opponent.

After a very long and heavy bout of wrestling, Rostam breaks Sohrab's back and stabs him. Sohrab, dying, tells Rostam that his father will avenge his death and only then do they realize their identities. Sohrab produces the necklace that Rostam once gave Tahmina, who gave it to her son to keep him safe during the war. Rostam grieves heavily but cannot save his son. When she finds out her son is dead, Tahmina burns Sohrab's house and gives away all his riches. Then "the breath departed from out her body, and her spirit went forth after Sohrab her son."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Ferdowsi/kings.8.rustemsohrab.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - The Epic of Kings by Ferdowsi|author=|date=|website=classics.mit.edu|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9561">'''''Surnaturel''''' is a book written by the [[Roman-Catholic]] theologian [[Henri de Lubac]]. It stands among his most famous and controversial works.

In this book he traces the historical meaning of the word 'supernatural' and notes a shift in implication. Up to the High Middle Ages, the essential contrast was drawn between 'natural' and 'moral'. After that, the contrast was seen between 'natural and supernatural'. De Lubac is trying here to establish the correct understanding of [[Aquinas]] on this subject.

==Context==
De Lubac began work on the ideas which would eventually appear as ''Surnaturel'' in his days as a student in Hastings.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth Century Catholic Theologians: From Neoscholasticism to Nuptial Mystery'', (Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell, 2007), p72&lt;/ref&gt; De Lubac published several articles in the 1930s which were to make up much of ''Surnaturel''. The development of the book itself, though, was greatly hindered by the war. In June 1940, fleeing the advancing Nazis, de Lubac left Lyon with a bag which included the notebook for ''Surnaturel'', on which he worked for several days. De Lubac stated in later years that the book had taken sufficient shape by 1941 to be ready for review; the ''nihil obstat'' was granted in February 1942. However, paper shortages prevented publication. In 1943, while being hunted by the Gestapo, de Lubac fled, again carrying his notebook, this time to Vals. He used the resources in the Vals library to continue his work on the book. Eventually, in October 1945 the ''Imprimatur'' was issued, and in 1946, the book was published (though only as an edition of 700 copies, due to ongoing paper shortages).&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument==
De Lubac's overall question in ''Surnaturel'' is therefore how human persons in the natural order can be interiorly directed to the order of grace that fulfils them, without in the least possessing this grace in anticipation, and without being able at all to claim it for themselves. In the book, de Lubac attempts to show how, in an attempt to answer this question, what he calls "the system of pure nature" had come to prevail in Catholic theology.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that in the Fathers and the great scholastics there was only one concrete order of history, that in which God had made humanity for himself, and in which human nature had thus been created only for a single destiny, which was supernatural. Neither the Fathers nor the scholastics, therefore, ever envisioned the possibility of a purely natural end for human persons attainable by their own intrinsic powers of cognition and volition.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

De Lubac argues that this unified vision began to unravel in the thought of theologians such as [[Denys the Carthusian]] and, more pertinently, [[Thomas Cajetan|Cajetan]]. While Denys had argued for a natural end of the human person to which a supernatural end must be 'superadded', he did so consciously in opposition to the teaching of Thomas Aquinas. Cajetan, however, while making a similar argument to Denys, did so while claiming simply to be ''commenting on'' Thomas: he therefore introduced the idea of human nature as "a closed and sufficient whole" into Thomism.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a 'pure nature', argues de Lubac, intensified in the wake of the naturalism of Baius and Jansenius: a state of pure nature - a hypothesis according to which human persons might have been created with an end proportionate to their natural powers - was seen as necessary to protect the gratuity of the supernatural. Affirmation of such a state, argued de Lubac, overlooked the decisive difference between the created human spirit and other natures. Moreover, while allowing Catholic theologians to defend the essential integrity of fallen human nature against the Protestantism that denied it, the system effected a separation between nature and the supernatural that would prove pernicious - by rendering the latter (seemingly) superfluous. Although, de Lubac argues, the system of 'pure nature' was perceived to be a novelty when it first developed, it eventually came to be taken for granted, such that, by the twentieth century, rejecting it became synonymous with denying the gratuity of the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

''Surnaturel ''is broken into four parts, which are pieced together from a number of earlier preparatory studies. 
* The first part, entitled 'Augustinianism and Baianism', examines the interpretation of Augustine by [[Michael Baius|Baius]] and [[Cornelius Jansen|Jansenius]], showing how these two early modern thinkers misconstrue Augustine's true intention. That is, de Lubac argued that, influenced by a juridical-naturalistic way of thinking foreign to Augustine (and to his disciples, including Thomas Aquinas), Baius and Jansenius in their different ways denied the gratuity of the gifts made by God to Adam. De Lubac shows how the hypothesis of 'purely natural finality' attributed to a 'purely spiritual nature' was developed to insure this gratuity.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second part, 'Spirit and Freedom in the Theological Tradition', examines one of the essential aspects of the spiritual 'nature' (both human and angelic), namely, its freedom of choice with respect to its end. De Lubac considers the tradition from the Fathers up to the seventeenth century, and provides further evidence for the claim that Aquinas, for example, never envisioned any finality for the created spirit but a supernatural one.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The third part examines the origins of the word 'supernatural', including the problematic epithet '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''superadditum''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' ('something superadded'), and the confusion of the 'supernatural' with the 'miraculous' (in the sense of a completely arbitrary addition). De Lubac shows in this section that the term 'supernatural' was first used systematically by St Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fourth part offers six 'Historical Notes' on St Thomas and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the conclusion, 'Divine Exigence and Natural Desire', de Lubac indicates why it is unnecessary to have recourse to the hypothetical system of pure nature to protect the gratuity of the beatific vision.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The publication of the work caused immediate controversy in Catholic thought. De Lubac's thought came to be associated as representing a ''[[Nouvelle Théologie]]'', a name applied to de Lubac's thought by his critics. In 1950, de Lubac was asked by the General of the Jesuits to stop teaching, and to give up working at the journal ''Recherches de Science Religieuse. ''An order was issued to withdraw from Jesuit libraries and from the trade three of his books - ''Surnaturel, Corpus Mysticum'' and ''De la Connaissance de Dieu'', as well as a 1949 article in ''Recherches'' in which de Lubac addressed some criticisms of ''Surnaturel''.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xxii&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, it was widely suspected that it was his views which were attacked in the papal encyclical ''[[Humani generis|Humani Generis]]''. De Lubac was ostracised for a decade.

In the early 1960s, however, his ideas became more accepted in the Catholic hierarchy, and he was among the first summoned by [[Pope John XXIII]] to help draft the texts for Vatican II.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth Century Catholic Theologians: From Neoscholasticism to Nuptial Mystery'', (Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell, 2007), p76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 de Lubac published two works:'' Le Mystere du surnaturel'', and ''Augustinisme et théologie moderne, ''which served primarily to clarify numerous objections to ''Surnaturel. Mystere ''largely followed the structure of the 1949 article with the same title in which de Lubac had responded to some criticisms of ''Surnaturel''. ''Augustinisme ''was a reprint of the first part of ''Surnaturel'', enlarged with some new texts.

==Editions==

{{Music Education|major}}
The '''Suzuki method''' is an internationally known music curriculum and teaching philosophy dating from the mid-20th century, created by Japanese [[violin]]ist and pedagogue [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]] (1898–1998). The method aims to create an [[Nature versus nurture|environment]] for learning music which parallels the linguistic environment of acquiring a native language. Suzuki believed that this environment would also help to foster good [[moral character]].

==Background==
{{quote|I want to make good citizens.  If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance.  He gets a beautiful heart.|Shinichi Suzuki}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Suzuki Method was conceived in the mid-20th century by Suzuki, a Japanese [[violin]]ist who desired to bring beauty to the lives of children in his country after the devastation of [[World War II]]. As a skilled violinist but a beginner at the [[German language]] who struggled to learn it, Suzuki noticed that children pick up their native language quickly, and even dialects adults consider "difficult" to learn are spoken with ease by children at age five or six. He reasoned that if children have the skill to acquire their [[first language|native language]], they have the necessary ability to become proficient on a musical instrument.  

He pioneered the idea that preschool age children could learn to play the violin if the learning steps were small enough and the instrument was scaled down to fit their body.  He modeled his method, which he called {{nihongo|"Talent Education"|才能教育|sainō kyōiku}}, after his theories of natural [[language acquisition]]. Suzuki believed that every child, if properly taught, was capable of a high level of musical achievement. He also made it clear that the goal of such musical education was to raise generations of children with "noble hearts" (as opposed to creating famous musical [[child prodigy|prodigies]]).

==Philosophy==
{{quote|''...all'' children can be well educated...|Shin'ichi Suzuki}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The central belief of Suzuki, based on his language acquisition theories, is that all people can (and will) learn from their [[Nature versus nurture|environment]].  The essential components of his method spring from the desire to create the "right environment" for learning music (he believed that this positive environment would also help to foster excellent [[moral character|character]] in every student).  These components include:

*Saturation in the musical [[community]]. 
::This includes attending local classical music [[concert]]s, developing friendships with other music students, and listening to recordings of professional musicians in the home every day, starting before birth if possible.
*Deliberate avoidance of musical aptitude tests or [[audition]]s to begin music study. 
::Suzuki believed that teachers who test for musical aptitude before taking students, or who look only for "talented" students, are limiting themselves to people who have already started their music education. Just as every child is expected to learn their native language, Suzuki expected every child to be able to learn to play music.
*Emphasis on playing from a very young age,
::typically starting formal instruction between the ages of three and five years old.  (See [[Suzuki method#Technique|Technique]]).
*Using well-trained teachers.
::Suzuki believed in training musicians not only to be better musicians but also to be better teachers. Suzuki Associations worldwide offer ongoing teacher-training programs to prospective and continuing Suzuki teachers.  
*In the beginning, [[learning music by ear]] is emphasized over reading written [[musical notation]].  
::Suzuki observed that children speak before learning to read, and thought that children should also be able to play music before learning to read. To support learning by ear, students are expected to listen to recordings of the music they are learning daily. Other methods—such as [[Simply Music]], the Gordon Music Learning Theory, and Conversational Solfège—have students playing before reading notes, but may not have the same focus on daily listening and learning by ear.
*Memorization of all solo repertoire is expected.
::The focus on memorization continues even after a student begins to use [[sheet music]] to learn new pieces. 
*Music theory and note reading are left to the teacher. 
::The Suzuki method does not include a formal plan or prescribe specific materials for introducing music theory &amp; reading, in part because Suzuki created the method in a culture where music literacy was routinely taught in schools.
*Regular playing in groups (including playing pieces in [[unison]]) is strongly encouraged.
*Retaining and reviewing every piece of music ever learned is also strongly encouraged. 
::This is intended to raise technical and musical ability. Review pieces, along with "preview" parts of music a student is yet to learn, are often used in place of the more traditional [[etude]] books.  Traditional etudes and technical studies are not used in the beginning stages, which focus almost exclusively on a set of performance pieces.
*Frequent public performance makes performing feel like a natural and enjoyable part of being a musician.

The method discourages competitive attitudes between players, and advocates collaboration and mutual encouragement for those of every ability and level.  However, this does not mean the elimination of auditions or evaluations of student performances.

The parent of the young student is expected to supervise instrument practice every day, instead of leaving the child to practice alone between lessons, and to attend and take notes at every lesson so they can coach the student effectively. This element of the method is so prominent that a newspaper article once dubbed it "The Mom-Centric Method."&lt;ref name="meyermom"&gt;Meyer, Constance (2003-09-07). The Mom-centric method. LA Times, 7 September 2003. Retrieved from http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/07/entertainment/ca-meyer7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
Although Suzuki was a violinist, the method he founded is not a "school of violin playing" (like the French or the Russian schools of playing) whose students can be identified by the set of techniques they use to play the violin.  However, some of the technical concepts Suzuki taught his own students, such as the development of "tonalization", were so essential to his way of teaching that they have been carried over into the entire method.  Other non-instrument specific techniques are used to implement the basic elements of the philosophy in each [[academic discipline|discipline]].

*'''Tonalization''' is a term coined by Suzuki, and is deliberately similar to the word "vocalization" (as it is used by singers when they talk about warming up their voices).  Tonalization is defined as the student's ability to produce and recognize a beautiful, ringing tone quality on their instrument. While initially developed for violin education, the tonalization technique has been applied to other instruments such as the piano. Suzuki believed that a student must learn tonalization in order to properly reproduce and perform music (Lavie, Karen, New Zealand Suzuki Journal, 2005).  Outside the Suzuki method, the term used is "tone production," and is part of Western music education stretching back to its beginning. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
*Using '''[[sound recording]]s''' is another technique common to all the musical instruments taught in the Suzuki method.  Thibeault's (2018) history of Suzuki's mediated pedagogy presents Suzuki as a technological innovator who created new ways of learning from sound recordings. Pre-recorded music is used to help students learn notes, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[rhythm]], and beautiful tone quality [[learning music by ear|by ear]]. Suzuki pointed out that great artists (such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) were surrounded with excellent performances from birth, and that the advent of recording technology made this aspect of their environment possible to achieve for large numbers of "ordinary" people whose parents were not themselves great musicians &amp; music teachers like [[Leopold Mozart|Mozart's father]] was.  So-called "traditional" (that is, not Suzuki trained) music educators have used this technique since the earliest days of recording technology; the difference in the Suzuki method is the scale on which Suzuki systematically insisted on daily listening in the home, from before birth if possible, and his focus on using recordings of beginner's repertoire alongside recordings of advanced repertoire.
*"Adult" sized '''instruments are adapted''' to meet the demands of a small child's body in various ways.  This lowers the age at which people are developmentally ready to begin studying an instrument.  Scaled down instrument sizes are used for children studying [[stringed instruments]]. Curved headjoint flutes with displaced keys which are closer together than normal flute keys &amp; holes are also available making it possible for children as young as 3 years old to study the flute through the Suzuki method.  Height adjustable chairs, benches, and footrests are used for piano, guitar, cello, and string bass.  Although fractional sized student violins were available when Suzuki began to teach, the success and popularity of his idea that pre-school aged children could also learn to play prompted [[luthier|violinmakers]] to scale violins down to even smaller [[violin#Sizes|sizes]] than before.
*'''Suzuki Institutes''' were established to encourage a musical community, train teachers, and provide a place where master teachers' ideas can be spread to the whole community of Suzuki students, teachers and parents.  These short term music festivals began in Matsumoto, Japan, where teachers &amp; students came to learn from Suzuki.  In the US, they often last for a week or two and include daily [[masterclass]]es; repertoire (group) classes; teacher training courses; concerts; discussion sessions; seminars; and various 'enrichment' classes in different musical styles, instruments, or non-musical (usually arts, crafts, or dancing) activities.  As at any music festival, participants must pay registration and tuition fees to the institute they are attending.  Each national Suzuki association handles registration for teacher training, and policies differ from country to country.
*A '''common repertoire''' for all students of an instrument was established.  This body of music allows each student to participate in group classes, helps foster local and international musical community and camaraderie, and provides motivation for students to learn new music while keeping the 'old' pieces they have learned in top form.  This is in direct contrast to music education outside of the method, in which teachers tailor the repertoire to the current need and level of the individual student.

==Repertoire==
{{quote|...If it is true that "everything in music is preparation" (Gerhart Zimmermann), then the genius of Suzuki is truly expressed in the scope and sequencing of the music....|Edward Kreitman}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The core Suzuki literature is published on [[sound recording|audio recordings]] and in [[sheet music]] books for each instrument, and Suzuki teachers supplement the repertoire common to each instrument as needed, particularly in the area of teaching reading.  One of the innovations of the Suzuki method was to make quality recordings of the beginners' pieces widely available, performed by professional musicians. Many traditional (non-Suzuki trained) music teachers also use the Suzuki repertoire, often to supplement their [[curriculum]], and they adapt the music to their own philosophies of teaching.

Another innovation of Suzuki was to deliberately leave out the large amount of technical instructions and exercises found in many beginners' music books of his day.  He favored a focus on melodic [[song]]-playing over technical exercises, and asked teachers to allow students to make music from the beginning, helping to motivate young children with short, attractive songs which can themselves be used as technique building exercises.  Each song in the common repertoire is carefully chosen to introduce some new or higher level of technique than the previous selection.

Suzuki teaching uses a common core repertoire for students of the same instrument worldwide, and although it focuses on Western European "classical" music, it emphasizes that this music can be a bridge across cultural and language barriers: one does not have to share the ethnic or national origin of the composers in order to learn or share the music. Suzuki created a series of rhythmic variations on the theme "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", using rhythms from more advanced literature in units small enough for a beginner to grasp quickly.  Although these variations were created for violin, most of the instruments use them as a starting point for their repertoire.

===Violin===
The violin method was compiled and edited by [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Suzuki]].  In ten volumes, beginning with Suzuki's [[Variation (music)|Variations]] on "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]" and ending with two [[Mozart]] concertos.  The first 3 books are mostly graded [[arrangements]] of music not originally written for solo violin, although book 1 contains several original compositions by Suzuki for violin &amp; piano. These arrangements are drawn from folk tunes and from composers such as [[Bach]], [[Telemann]], [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Beethoven]], [[Schubert]], [[Handel]], [[Paganini]], [[Boccherini]] and [[Brahms]]. Books 4–10 continue the graded selection by incorporating 'standard' or 'traditional' student violin solos by [[Fritz Seitz|Seitz]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Bach]], [[Veracini]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]], [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf|Dittersdorf]], [[Rameau]], [[Handel]], [[Mozart]], [[Fiocco]], and others. The Suzuki violin repertoire is currently in the process of being revised by the International Suzuki Association, and as part of the revision process, each regional Suzuki Association provides a recommended list of supplemental repertoire appropriate for students in books 6-8. The SAA supplemental repertoire list includes pieces by Bach, [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]], [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartok]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], and others (Suggested Supplementary Repertoire, 2013, and Preucil, 1985).

Audio recordings for books 1–4 are available in separate albums by artists such as [[David Nadien]], [[David Cerone]], Yukari Tate and Shin'ichi Suzuki. More recent recordings of volumes 1–4 by William Preucil, Jr. were released in 2007, along with revised versions of the first 4 books.  Recordings for books 5–8 have been made by [[Koji Toyoda]], although many of the pieces can be found separately on other artist's albums. In 2008 [[Takako Nishizaki]] made a complete set of recordings of Books 1-8 for [[Naxos Records]]. There are no official recordings of books 9 and 10 but these books, simply being Mozart's A major and D major violin concertos, have readily available recordings by various violinists. Completing the 10 volumes is not the end of the Suzuki journey, as many Suzuki violin teachers traditionally continue with the [[Max Bruch|Bruch]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] concertos, along with pieces from other composers such as [[Maria Theresa von Paradis|Paradis]],
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]].

===Viola===
The viola repertoire is in nine volumes, compiled and edited by [[Doris Preucil]]. Like the violin repertoire, much of the viola repertoire is drawn from the [[Baroque]] period. The first 3 volumes have been arranged (or [[transposition (music)|transposed]]) almost directly from the first 3 violin volumes, and the rest differ significantly as they delve into standard viola literature.  The viola books introduce shifting and work in higher positions earlier than the violin volumes, in anticipation of viola students being asked to play in ensembles sooner in their studies than violinists, and needing these skills to better handle orchestral or chamber music parts (Preucil, 1985). Viola volumes 4-8 include works by [[Telemann]], [[Henri Casadesus|Casadesus]], [[Bach]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Jean-Marie Leclair|Leclair]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]],and [[Max Bruch|Bruch]]. Books 1–4 have been recorded on two albums by [[William Preucil]], and the rest are available in separate albums.

===Cello===
The cello repertoire is in ten volumes, with some early pieces arranged from the early violin volumes, and the first distinct piece (the second) being "French Folk Song".  Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi performs volumes 1 through 4. Volumes 4–10 contain works by: [[Vivaldi]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[David Popper|Popper]], [[Breval]], [[Goltermann]], [[William Henry Squire|Squire]], [[Bach]], [[Maria Theresa von Paradis|Paradis]], [[Henry Eccles|Eccles]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[von Goens]], [[Sammartini]], [[Haydn]], and [[Boccherini]].

===Piano===
The piano repertoire is composed of seven volumes. The first book begins with Variations on "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" (as with the violin books) and continues with many folk songs and contemporary songs. As one progresses to the second book, there are pieces written by [[classical period (music)|romantic, classical]] and [[baroque music|baroque]] composers, such as Robert Schumann, [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. The third book is early intermediate level with several sonatinas and beginning with Sonatina in C Major, Op. 36, No. 1 by Muzio Clementi. The fourth book includes Sonata in G Major, Op. 49, No. 2 by Ludwig van Beethoven and ends with Minuet 1,  Minuet 2 and the Gigue from Partita in B{{Music|b}} by J.S. Bach.  The fifth book begins with the famous "[[Für Elise]]" by Beethoven and includes Sonata in C Major, Hob. XVI/35 by Franz Joseph Haydn.  The sixth book begins with the Sonata in C Major, K.545 by W.A. Mozart, and the seventh book begins with the Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major by [[Mozart]].  This book also includes "[[The Harmonious Blacksmith]]" by [[Handel]] and Romanian Folk Dances by Béla Bartók. There are also many [[minuet]]s in the second book. The New International Edition adds some more recent compositions to the books, such as the music of Béla Bartók. Revised versions of the piano books have now been published.  The new volumes are collections of piano repertoire from all eras representing works by composers such as Mozart, Burgmüller, Beethoven, Bach, Tcherepnin, Tchaikovsky, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Daquin, Grieg, Granados, Villa-Lobos, Scarlatti, Handel, Bartók, and Debussy. Many pieces from the original books remain; some have been shifted to another volume.  The book/CD combo for Revised Books 4-7 is now available, and was performed by Japanese concert artist Seizo Azuma.

===Bass===
Currently there are five printed volumes in the [[double bass]] series, with the first three volumes also available on recordings. Nine volumes are planned and being compiled and edited by Dr. S Daniel Swaim (SAA, Chair), Virginia Dixon (SAA), Michael Fanelli (SAA), Domenick Fiore (SAA), and Eugene Rebeck (SAA). Volume 1 and 2 contain arrangements of the traditional Suzuki violin pieces mixed in with some new arrangements of other pieces. Volume 3 contains some new transcriptions of jazz, Gaelic, and folk songs; plus works by [[Handel]], [[Gossec]], [[Beethoven]], [[Bach]], Webster, [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], and [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]. Famous pieces include: The Elephant from [[Carnival of the Animals]] by Saint-Saëns, [[Ode to Joy]] by Beethoven, and Largo from the [[New World Symphony]] by Dvořák.

===Flute===
The flute repertoire is compiled and edited by Toshio Takahashi. In fourteen volumes, beginning with [[Mary Had a Little Lamb]] and ending in the Flute Concerto by [[Otaka]]. Also included are concerti by [[Mozart]], [[Cimarosa]], [[Ibert]] and [[Quantz]]. Students also study music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Handel]], [[Michel Blavet|Blavet]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]] and other major composers.

===Recorder===
There are eight volumes of recorder repertoire for both soprano and alto recorder.  The recorder repertoire shares some early repertoire with other instruments, such as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star", several Bach Minuets, etc.  Later books delve into more complex Renaissance and Baroque music, including instruction in intense Baroque ornamentation along with 17th-century Dutch and Italian articulation techniques.

===Guitar===
The [[classical guitar]] repertoire was compiled through a collaborative process involving teachers from the United States, Europe and Australia, and edited by Frank Longay.  The nine volumes begin with Twinkle Variations and many folk songs, and adds pieces originally written for the [[lute]] in the Renaissance, and spanning all musical time periods, including pieces by [[Gaspar Sanz|Sanz]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Matteo Carcassi|Carcassi]], [[Mauro Giuliani|Giuliani]], [[Fernando Sor|Sor]], [[Francisco Tárrega|Tarrega]], [[Isaac Albéniz|Albéniz]], [[Alonso Mudarra|Mudarra]], and Yocoh's [[Sakura Sakura|Sakura]] Variations.  Music in book one is performed by Frank Longay and Bill Kossler, with books two through four recorded by Seth Himmelhoch, Andrew LaFrenier, and Louis Brown.  George Sakellariou has recorded books five, six and seven and [[William Kanengiser]] recorded books 8 and 9, with the exception of [[Recuerdos de la Alhambra]] in book 9, which was recorded by [[Scott Tennant]].

===Harp===
The harp repertoire is in five volumes. These books are suitable for learning to read and play music on the pedal harp or the lever harp (folk harp, Irish/Celtic harp, etc. that preferably has 30 or more strings). Most of the music is arrangements of either folk music or classical music. Students of the lever harp will find some of the pieces in the later books to have challenging lever changes.  This series ultimately leads to more in-depth study of the pedal harp and its repertoire and teaches more of a classical style technique.  Those pursuing traditional Celtic music can use this as a foundation, however, the traditional style of teaching focuses on relying on the ear rather than on the written note.  Repertoire for volume six is selected, though the music is not published in a single book.&lt;ref&gt;http://suzukiharpinfo.com/whats-new-suzuki-harp/book-status/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice===
The voice repertoire is in five Levels.  Developed in Finland since 1986, the vocal repertoire of the Suzuki method has spread to over 20 countries including The United States, Australia, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. Teacher training courses are scheduled yearly in Europe, US and Australia.

===Organ===
The [[pipe organ]] repertoire was compiled and edited by Gunilla Rönnberg and Lars Hagström beginning in 1998.  Currently Volumes 1-4 have been published, Volumes 5 &amp; 6 will be published shortly, and material for Volumes 7 &amp; 8 is being researched. (Suzuki Organ website, 2010). As of 2011, an active Suzuki-training organ scheme is under way in the Australian city of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].

===Mandolin===
The application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the mandolin is currently being researched in Italy by Amelia Saracco.

===Early childhood education and Suzuki in the schools===
Although [[early childhood education]] (ECE) is not an instrument, a curriculum for (pre-instrumental) ECE has been developed within the Suzuki philosophy by Dorothy Jones (SAA), Jeong Cheol Wong (ASA), Emma O'Keefe (PPSA), Anke van der Bijl (ESA), and Yasuyo Matsui (TERI).  Also, a "modified" Suzuki philosophy curriculum has been developed to apply Suzuki teaching to heterogeneous instrumental music classes &amp; string orchestras in schools.

===Trumpet===
Trumpet was added to the International Suzuki Association's list of Suzuki Method instruments in 2011. The application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the trumpet is currently being researched in Sweden; the first Trumpet teacher training course to be offered by the European Suzuki Association in 2013. (Suzuki Teacher Training for Trumpet, 2013).

===Supplemental materials===
Supplementary materials are also published under the Suzuki name, including some etudes, note-reading books, piano accompaniment parts, guitar accompaniment parts, [[duet]]s, [[trio (music)|trio]]s, [[string orchestra]], and [[string quartet]] arrangements of Suzuki repertoire.

==Historical notes==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
In the late 19th century, Japan's borders were [[Meiji period#Economy|opened to trade with the outside world]], and in particular to the importation of [[Western Culture]].  As a result of this, Suzuki's father, who owned a company which had manufactured the [[Shamisen]], began to manufacture [[violin]]s instead. (''Nurture by Love'' Documentary) In his youth, Shin'ichi Suzuki chanced to hear a [[phonograph]] recording of [[Franz Schubert]]'s Ave Maria, as played on violin by [[Mischa Elman]].  Gripped by the beauty of the music, he immediately picked up a violin from his father's factory and began to teach himself to play the instrument "[[learning music by ear|by ear]]".  His father felt that instrumental performance was beneath his son's social status, and refused to allow him to study the instrument.  At age 17, he began to teach himself by ear, since no formal training was allowed to him.  Eventually he convinced his father to allow him to study with a violin teacher in Tokyo. (Suzuki, ''Nurtured by Love'')

At age 22, Suzuki travelled to Germany to find a violin teacher to continue his studies.  While there, he studied privately with [[Karl Klingler]], but did not receive any formal degree past his high school diploma.  He met and became friends with [[Albert Einstein]], who encouraged him in learning classical music.  He also met, courted, and married his wife, Waltraud.(Suzuki, ''Nurtured by Love'')

In 1945, Suzuki began his Talent Education movement in [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]], [[Japan]] shortly after the end of [[World War II]].  Raising children with "noble hearts" (inspired by great music and diligent study) was one of his primary goals; he believed that people raised and "nurtured by love" in his method would grow up to achieve better things than war. One of his students during this post-1945 period was violinist Hidetaro Suzuki, no relation, who later became a veteran of international violin competitions (Tchaikovsky, Queen Elizabeth, Montreal International) and then the longtime concertmaster of the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]]. (Hermann, 1981)

Eventually, the center of the Suzuki movement in education was established as the Talent Education Research Institute (TERI) in Matsumoto.  TERI hosts thousands of people each year—students, parents, teachers, (and teacher trainees).  Other organizations have sprung up all over the world to help oversee the movement and train teachers.  These include the Asia Suzuki Association, the Suzuki Association of the Americas, the European Suzuki Association (which is currently assisting in the beginnings of the Suzuki movement in [[Africa]]), and the Pan-Pacific Suzuki Association.(International Suzuki Association, 2016).

[[John D. Kendall]] of [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] brought the Suzuki method, along with adaptations to better fit the requirements of the American classroom, to the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s (''Nurtured by Love'' Documentary). [[Vilem Sokol]] of the [[Seattle Youth Symphony]] hosted Suzuki in Seattle. The majority of American Suzuki pedagogues and teaching methods are grounded in the Suzuki-Kendall system.  Other pioneers of the Suzuki Method in the US include [[Roland and Almita Vamos]], Elizabeth and Harlow Mills, [[Betty Haag]], Louise Behrend, Dorothy Roffman, William Starr, Anastasia Jempelis, and Margery Aber.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Thatching''' is the craft of building a [[roof]] with dry vegetation such as [[straw]], [[Phragmites|water reed]], [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] (''[[Cladium mariscus]]''), [[Juncus|rushes]], [[Calluna|heather]], or [[palm branch]]es, layering the vegetation so as to shed water away from the inner roof. Since the bulk of the vegetation stays dry and is densely packed—trapping air—thatching also functions as insulation. It is a very old roofing method and has been used in both [[tropical]] and [[temperate climates]]. Thatch is still employed by builders in developing countries, usually with low-cost local vegetation. By contrast, in some developed countries it is  the choice of some affluent people who desire a rustic look for their home, would like a more ecologically friendly roof, or who have purchased an originally thatched abode.

==History==
Thatching methods have traditionally been passed down from generation to generation, and numerous descriptions of the materials and methods used in [[Europe]] over the past three centuries survive in archives and early publications.
[[File:Thatch C8248 Stretton on Fosse.jpg|thumb|Thatched roof, England]]
In some equatorial countries, thatch is the prevalent local material for [[roof]]s, and often [[wall]]s. There are diverse building techniques from the [[ancient Hawaiian]] ''hale'' shelter made from the local [[Cordyline fruticosa|ti leaves]] (''Cordyline fruticosa''), [[lauhala]] (''Pandanus tectorius'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Lex AJ | last1 = Thomson | first2 = Lois | last2 = Englberger | first3 = Luigi | last3 = Guarino | first4 = RR | last4 = Thaman | first5 = Craig R | last5 = Elevitch | year = 2006 | chapter = Pandanus tectorius (''Pandanus'') | edition = 1.1 | editor-first = Craig R | editor-last = Elevitch | title = Species Profiles for Pacific Island Agroforestry | publisher = Permanent Agriculture Resources (PAR) | location = Hōlualoa, [[Hawai‘i|HI]] | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/P.tectorius-pandanus.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121021015441/http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/P.tectorius-pandanus.pdf | archivedate = 2012-10-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Heteropogon contortus|pili grass]] (''Heteropogon contortus'').
[[File:PrayerAtBesakih.jpg|thumb|right|The multi-tiered [[Meru tower]]s of [[Besakih]] temple, [[Bali]], uses black ''[[Arenga pinnata|ijuk]]'' fibres.]]
Palm leaves are also often used. For example, in Na Bure, [[Fiji]], thatchers combine fan palm leave roofs with layered reed walls. Feathered palm leaf roofs are used in Dominica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hawaiianthatch.com/index-3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140201101759/http://hawaiianthatch.com/index-3.html |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imperata cylindrica|Alang-alang]] (''Imperata cylindrica'') thatched roofs are used in Hawaii and [[Bali]]. In Southeast Asia, mangrove [[Nypa fruticans|nipa palm]] leaves are used as thatched roof material known as [[attap dwelling]]. In Bali, [[Indonesia]], the black fibres of [[Arenga pinnata]] called ''ijuk'' is also used as thatched roof materials, usually used in [[Balinese temple]] roof and meru towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Indonesian Town Revisited, Volume 1 of Southeast Asian dynamics | author = Peter J.

Wild vegetation such as water reed (''Phragmites australis''), bulrush/cat tail (''Typha'' spp.), broom (''Cytisus scoparius''), heather (''Calluna vulgaris''), and rushes (''Juncus'' spp. and ''Schoenoplectus lacustris'') was probably used to cover shelters and primitive dwellings in Europe in the late Palaeolithic period, but so far no direct archaeological evidence for this has been recovered. People probably began to use straw in the Neolithic period when they first grew cereals—but once again, no direct archaeological evidence of straw for thatching in Europe prior to the early medieval period survives.{{Sfn | Letts | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}

Many [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] people of the Americas, such as the former Maya civilization, Mesoamerica, the Inca empire, and the Triple Alliance (Aztec), lived in thatched buildings. It is common to spot thatched buildings in rural areas of the Yucatán Peninsula as well as many settlements in other parts of Latin America, which closely resemble the method of construction from distant ancestors. After the collapse of most extant American societies due to diseases introduced by Europeans, wars, enslavement, and genocide, the first Americans encountered by Europeans lived in structures roofed with bark or skin set in panels that could be added or removed for ventilation, heating, and cooling.  Evidence of the many complex buildings with fiber-based roofing material was not rediscovered until the early 2000s. French and British settlers built temporary thatched dwellings with local vegetation as soon as they arrived in New France and New England, but covered more permanent houses with wooden shingles.

[[File:Thatched Roof Cottage, Cotswolds, England (2016).jpg|thumb|Thatched Roof Cottage, Cotswolds, England (2016)]]

In most of England, thatch remained the only roofing material available to the bulk of the population in the countryside, in many towns and villages, until the late 1800s.&lt;ref name= "MoirLetts"&gt;{{Citation | first1 = J | last1 = Moir | first2 = John | last2 = Letts | title = Thatch: Thatching in England 1790–1940 | publisher = English Heritage | journal = Research Transactions | volume = 5 | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Slate industry in Wales|Commercial production of Welsh slate]] began in 1820, and the mobility provided by [[canals]] and then [[railways]] made other materials readily available. Still, the number of thatched properties actually increased in the UK during the mid-1800s as agriculture expanded, but then declined again at the end of the 19th century because of agricultural recession and rural depopulation.  
[[File:Thatch stanton c 8333.jpg|thumb|Cottage with thatched roof in Stanton, a village in the Cotswolds, England]]
Gradually, thatch became a mark of poverty, and the number of thatched properties gradually declined, as did the number of professional thatchers. Thatch has become much more popular in the UK over the past 30 years, and is now a symbol of wealth rather than poverty. There are approximately 1,000 full-time thatchers at work in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Letts | first = John | edition = unpublished | title = Survey | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and thatching is becoming popular again because of the renewed interest in preserving historic buildings and using more sustainable building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/magical-thatched-homes-that-will-enchant-you/ss-BBIRVia#image=21|title=Magical thatched homes that will enchant you|author=|date=|website=www.msn.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402035458/http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/magical-thatched-homes-that-will-enchant-you/ss-BBIRVia#image=21|archivedate=2 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although thatch is popular in Germany, The Netherlands, Denmark, parts of France, Sicily, Belgium and Ireland, there are more thatched roofs in the [[United Kingdom]] than in any other European country.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2014}} Good quality straw thatch can last for more than 50 years when applied by a skilled thatcher. Traditionally, a new layer of straw was simply applied over the weathered surface, and this "spar coating" tradition has created accumulations of thatch over 7’ (2.1&amp;nbsp;m) thick on very old buildings. The straw is bundled into "yelms" before it is taken up to the roof and then is attached using staples, known as "spars", made from twisted hazel sticks. Over 250 roofs in Southern England have base coats of thatch that were applied over 500 years ago, providing direct evidence of the types of materials that were used for thatching in the medieval period.{{Sfn | Letts | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}  Almost all of these roofs are thatched with wheat, rye, or a "maslin" mixture of both.  Medieval wheat grew to almost {{convert |6|ft}} tall in very poor soils and produced durable straw for the roof and grain for baking bread.

Technological change in the [[farming]] [[industry]] significantly affected the popularity of thatching. The availability of good quality thatching straw declined in England after the introduction of the combine harvester in the late 1930s and 1940s, and the release of short-stemmed wheat varieties. Increasing use of nitrogen fertiliser in the 1960s–70s also weakened straw and reduced its longevity. Since the 1980s, however, there has been a big increase in straw quality as specialist growers have returned to growing older, tall-stemmed, "heritage" varieties of wheat such as Squareheads Master (1880), N59 (1959), Rampton Rivet (1937), Victor (1910) and April Bearded (early 1800s)] in low input/organic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Letts | first = John | year = 2007 | title = Growing Straw for Thatching: a guide | publisher = The COHT (Conservation of Historic Thatch Committee}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK it is illegal under the [[Plant Variety and Seeds Act 1964]] (with many amendments) for an individual or organisation to give, trade or sell seed of an older variety of wheat (or any other agricultural crop) to a third party for growing purposes, subject to a significant fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Legislation | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/14 | year = 1964 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111202021/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/14 | archivedate = 2012-01-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this legislation, thatchers in the UK can no longer obtain top quality thatching straw grown from traditional, tall-stemmed varieties of wheat.

All evidence indicates that water reed was rarely used for thatching outside of East Anglia.&lt;ref name= "MoirLetts"/&gt; It has traditionally been a "one coat" material applied in a similar way to how it is used in continental Europe. Weathered reed is usually stripped and replaced by a new layer. It takes 4–5 acres of well-managed reed bed to produce enough reed to thatch an average house, and large reed beds have been uncommon in most of England since the Anglo-Saxon period. Over 80% of the water reed used in the UK is now imported from [[Turkey]], [[Eastern Europe]], China and South Africa. Though water reed might last for 50 years or more on a steep roof in a dry climate, modern imported water reed on an average roof in England does not last any longer than good quality wheat straw. The lifespan of a thatched roof also depends on the skill of the thatcher, but other factors must be considered—such as [[climate]], quality of materials, and the roof pitch.

In areas where [[Arecaceae|palms]] are abundant, palm leaves are used to thatch walls and roofs. Many species of palm trees are called "[[thatch palm]]", or have "thatch" as part of their common names. In the [[southeastern United States]], Native and pioneer houses were often constructed of [[Arecaceae|palmetto]]-leaf thatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last = Andrews | editor1-first = Charles Mclean | editor2-last = Andrews | editor2-first = Evangeline Walker | origyear = 1945 | title = Jonathan Dickinson's Journal or, God's Protecting Providence.

===Photo essay showing men in Nigeria creating palm thatch ===

&lt;gallery mode=nolines widths="300px" heights="300px"&gt;
File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 1.jpg|The creativity that comes with mud housing in rural areas is largely in the art of its roofing, of crafting thatch. As poor areas develop, newer ways of doing things have arrived: faster, more reliable, more durable ways. Houses are now being raised with modern materials, and even the ones standing still in traditional clay and thatch are being refurbished with the fashionable cement blocks/metal roofing sheets. This progression has no doubt brought about a decline in the practice of traditional crafts such as thatching.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 2.jpg|Mr. Bassey Ekpenyong, an indigene of Ito community in Cross-River state, Nigeria, calls me his friend in that manner that, as a stranger serving in his community under the National Youth Service Corp, makes me feel safe. He invites me to his shop during evening hours, and as he offers me roasted nuts, he makes a new promise to take me on his bike to the beach when the rains have stopped and the roads are accessible again.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 3.jpg|It is on my return to Ito after a couple of weeks away that I first see him seated in the shade outside of his shop, palm leaves littered all over. He sees the excitement register on my face as I pass on my bike and signals that I return, as if to say, "I have been waiting for you." And truly, he has.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 4.jpg|He is making a new roof for his shop, he tells me. He wants me to make pictures. There are palm leaves all over, some tied up in a bunch, some lying underneath the sun, others thatched already and staked up in a pile. In his hands are two long, thinly carved sticks that would function as the skeletal frame for a pair of thatch.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 5.jpg|He begins a new pair and laughs as he talks; a satisfaction comes with the knowledge that he is creating for me yet another experience to take home when service is over. He makes a joke of it.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 6.jpg|He folds a leaf in half neatly across both sticks. He does the same for another leaf, lapping it with the previous; then, using another tiny stick which he breaks afterwards, pins the leaves firmly in place.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 7.jpg|The process continues until the sticks are fully covered in green palm leaves. He completes a pair of thatch in minutes and begins another.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 8.jpg|Mr. Bassey is a conversationalist. He talks about the need for this change, a practice he does every five years as this is the durability period for the thatch. "Nfok nkaya," he says in Efik, pointing to his shop behind: mud house with mat (thatch). He points to other houses around, including the ones made of clay but with metal roofing sheets, and calls them "Ikanga": zinc dey up.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 9.jpg|On other days, Mr Bassey is joined by his friends. They sit for long hours underneath the tree on their return from their various farms. They chat as they thatch, switching on occasion from Efik to English.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 10.jpg|They craft at the same pace, with the same measure of skill, but what intrigues me the most is their fellowship in that shared space, a communion of banter and silence. How silence descends on them as they craft, only to be broken yet again with a thought, a story, a sigh—childhood friends who had all grown up in this same space and carried within themselves different experiences as they each sorted life out; some leaving only to return yet again.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 11.jpg|Childhood friends thatching through time, memories into their palms, pinning them into that place of recollection, of regret, of conquests. Pinning them with the same laughter and voices that survived time.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 12.jpg|When asked how and when they had learnt thatching, the story is the same for everyone. They throw back to a time when they were just kids, when Ito was only made of the traditional mud houses.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 13.jpg|As kids, they had been taken along with other kids by the contractor, an older member of the community who dealt in sales of thatch, to the beach. There, they had each been assigned to a bunch of palm leaves, and had made dozens of thatch. This contractor in return had provided their meal for the day and bought them treats. Afterwards, he had also paid their mothers for the children's work; money meant for their upkeep.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 14.jpg|"We just sabi," Mr. Bassey tells me, explaining to me how he couldn't really pinpoint exactly how he had learnt. In a society where almost everything used was hand-crafted, most of these skills children grew into, got used to just by seeing them done on a daily basis, just by being a part of the home/society.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 15.jpg|"Those wen no sabi wen we go beach go just sidon look those wen sabi, or, watch contractor do am and dem go sabi."

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 16.jpg|To Mr. Bassey this is more. It carries sentiments enough for him to brag about the metal roofing sheets he's kept lying waste in his house for years. When the few thatched houses left have been broken down and then raised up in modern fashion, he still sits outside of his shop underneath the tree every five years, matting green leaves into thatch.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 17.jpg|His shop, once his home, carries for him memories of events: of childhood adventures; of leaving and returning; of his late wife, of loss. Memories that make him. And thatching, this craft, this practice of maintenance is, in a fast-paced world, for him the very means through which he holds time in his hands. The very means to which he laps these memories into a place of remembrance. The very means in which he shelters them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Maintenance in temperate climates==
[[File:Old-sanrizuka-goryou-farm,old-house-for-honored-guests,narita-city,japan.JPG|thumb|Thatched roof in [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]], [[Japan]].]]
Good thatch does not require frequent maintenance. In England a ridge normally lasts 8–14 years, and re-ridging is required several times during the lifespan of a thatch. Experts no longer recommend covering thatch with wire netting, as this slows evaporation and reduces longevity. [[Moss]] can be a problem if very thick, but is not usually detrimental, and many species of moss are actually protective. {{Citation | title = The Thatcher's Craft | year = 1960}}, remains the most widely used reference book on the techniques used for thatching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hct.ac.uk/Downloads/cp_thatch.html | publisher = HCT | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | title = Thatch | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111063005/http://www.hct.ac.uk/Downloads/cp_thatch.html | archivedate = 2012-01-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The thickness of a layer of thatch decreases over time as the surface gradually turns to compost and is blown off the roof by wind and rain. Thatched roofs generally needs replacement when the horizontal wooden 'sways' and hair-pin 'spars', also known as 'gads' (twisted hazel staples) that fix each course become visible near the surface. It is not total depth of the thatch within a new layer applied to a new roof that determines its longevity, but rather how much weathering thatch covers the fixings of each overlapping course. “A roof is as good as the amount of correctly laid thatch covering the fixings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.eamta.co.uk/ | title = The Thatch &amp; Thatching | publisher = The East Anglia Master Thatchers Association | place = UK | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831101444/http://www.eamta.co.uk/ | archivedate = 2011-08-31 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flammability ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
[[Image:House river kwai.jpg|thumb|right|River houses on the [[Khwae Noi River|River Kwai]].]]
Thatch is not as flammable as many people believe. It burns slowly, "like a closed book," thatchers say. The vast majority of fires are linked to the use of wood burners and faulty chimneys with degraded or poorly installed or maintained flues. Sparks from paper or burned rubbish can ignite dry thatch on the surface around a chimney. Fires can also begin when sparks or flames work their way through a degraded chimney and ignite the surrounding semi-charred thatch. This can be avoided by ensuring that the chimney is in good condition, which may involve stripping thatch immediately surrounding the chimney to the full depth of the stack. This can easily be done without stripping thatch over the entire roof. Insurance premiums on thatched houses are higher than average in part because of the perception that thatched roofs are a fire hazard, but also because a thatch fire can cause extensive smoke damage and a thatched roof is more expensive to replace than a standard tiled or slate roof. Workmen should never use open flame near thatch, and nothing should be burnt that could fly up the chimney and ignite the surface of the thatch. [[Spark arrestor]]s usually cause more harm than good, as they are easily blocked and reduce air flow. All thatched roofs should have smoke detectors in the roof space. Spray-on fire retardant or pressure impregnated fire retardants can reduce the spread of flame and radiated heat output.

On new buildings, a solid fire retardant barrier over the rafters can make the thatch sacrificial in case of fire. If fireboards are used, they require a ventilation gap between boarding and thatch so that the roof can breathe, as condensation can be a significant problem in thin, single layer thatch. Condensation is much less of a problem on thick straw roofs, which also provide much better insulation since they do not need to be ventilated.

==Performance==
[[Image:Kodaiji-2002-0098.jpg|thumb|Ihōan, a tea house at [[Kōdai-ji]] in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]].]]
The performance of thatch depends on roof shape and design, pitch of roof, position—its [[geography]] and [[topography]]—the quality of material and the expertise of the thatcher.

Thatch has some natural properties that are advantageous to its performance. It is naturally weather-resistant, and when properly maintained does not absorb a lot of water. There should not be a significant increase to roof weight due to water retention. A roof pitch of at least 50 degrees allows precipitation to travel quickly down slope so that it runs off the roof before it can penetrate the structure.

Thatch is also a natural insulator, and air pockets within straw thatch insulate a building in both warm and cold weather. A thatched roof ensures that a building is cool in summer and warm in winter.

Thatch also has very good resistance to wind damage when applied correctly.

===Advantages===
Thatching materials range from plains grasses to waterproof leaves found in equatorial regions. It is the most common roofing material in the world, because the materials are readily available.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}
[[Image:Partially thatched roof.jpg|thumb|right|Farm-house in the [[Netherlands]] near [[Alkmaar]]. The combination of thatch and [[roof tiles]] is quite common in that area.]]
Because thatch is lighter, less timber is required in the roof that supports it.

Thatch is a versatile material when it comes to covering irregular roof structures. This fact lends itself to the use of second-hand, [[recycled]] and natural materials that are not only more [[sustainable]], but need not fit exact standard dimensions to perform well.

===Disadvantages===
Thatched houses are harder to insure because of the perceived fire risk, and because thatching is labor-intensive, it is much more expensive to thatch a roof than to cover it with slate or tiles. Birds can damage a roof while they are foraging for grubs, and rodents are attracted by residual grain in straw.

[[Image:Lucy in the sky.jpg|thumb|right|Thatched hut in [[Lesotho]].]]
Thatch has fallen out of favor in much of the industrialized world not because of fire, but because thatching has become very expensive and alternative 'hard' materials are cheaper—but this situation is slowly changing. There are about 60,000 thatched roofs in the UK, of which 50–80 suffer a serious fire each year, most of these being completely destroyed. The cost to the Fire Brigade is £1.3m per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more thatched roofs are being built every year.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

New thatched roofs were forbidden in London in 1212 following a major fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/community/cmfabr08.html|title=Florilegium urbanum - Physical fabric - Regulations for building construction and fire safety |date=|website=users.trytel.com|accessdate=6 May 2018 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026234132/http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/community/cmfabr08.html |archivedate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and existing roofs had to have their surfaces plastered to reduce the risk of fire. The modern [[Shakespeare's Globe|Globe Theatre]] is one of the few thatched buildings in London (others can be found in the suburb of [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]]), but the Globe's modern, water reed thatch is purely for decorative purpose and actually lies over a fully waterproofed roof built with modern materials. The Globe Theatre, opened in 1997, was modelled on the Rose, which was destroyed by a fire on a dry June night in 1613 when a burning wad of cloth ejected from a special effects cannon during a performance set light to the surface of the thatch. The original Rose Theatre was actually thatched with cereal straw, a sample of which was recovered by Museum of London archaeologists during the excavation of the site in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Letts | title = Unpublished photos and sample records}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim thatch cannot cope with regular snowfall but, as with all roofing materials, this depends on the strength of the underlying roof structure and the pitch of the surface. A law passed in 1640 in [[Massachusetts]] outlawed the use of thatched roofs in the colony for this reason. Thatch is lighter than most other roofing materials, typically around {{convert|7|lb/sqft|abbr=on}}, so the roof supporting it does not need to be so heavily constructed, but if snow accumulates on a lightly constructed thatched roof, it could collapse. A thatched roof is usually pitched between 45–55 degrees and under normal circumstances this is sufficient to shed snow and water. In areas of extreme snowfall, such as [[Minka#Roofing|parts of Japan]], the pitch is increased further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addictedtotravel.com/holidays/snow-country|title=Winter Japan at its Best|publisher=Addicted to Travel|accessdate=7 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328175612/http://www.addictedtotravel.com/holidays/snow-country|archivedate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some thatched roofs in the UK are extremely old and preserve evidence of traditional materials and methods that have long since been lost. In northern Britain this evidence is often preserved beneath corrugated sheet materials and frequently come to light during the development of smaller rural properties. [[Historic Scotland]] have funded several research projects into thatching techniques and these have revealed a wide range of materials including broom, heather, rushes, cereals, bracken, turf and clay and highlighted significant regional variation &lt;ref&gt;Walker, B, McGregor, C.&amp; Stark, G  1996  Thatches and Thatching Techniques: A guide to conserving Scottish Thatching Traditions.

'''''The Sexual Paradox''''' is a book by [[Susan Pinker]] published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] in 2008. Pinker is a psychologist and columnist for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008&gt;
Bazelon (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sexual Paradox'' was 2009 winner of the [[American Psychological Association]]'s annual William James Book Award, a ''[[New York Times]]'' "Editor's Choice", and one of the "Best Books" reviewed by the ''[[Evening Standard]]''. &lt;!--- What is this book ABOUT?---&gt;

== Quotes ==

* "If you were to predict the future on the basis of school achievement alone ... the world would be a matriarchy." (Quoted in [[Emily Bazelon]]'s ''New York Times'' review. Bazelon goes on to note: "And yet, of course, it is not. Once they move from school to work, men on average earn more money and run more shows. They particularly dominate in national government, the corporate boardroom and the science laboratory.")&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008/&gt;
* "The puzzle is why the idea of sex differences continues to be so controversial." (Quoted in Bazelon.)&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008/&gt;

== Reviews ==

* "We shouldn't wish the role of sex differences away because they're at odds with feminist dogma. But that doesn't mean we should settle for the reductionist version of the relevant science, even if the complexity doesn't make for as neat a package between hard covers." — [[Emily Bazelon]], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008/&gt;{{clarify|reason=What on earth is this quotation demonstrating?  Is it a positive or negative review?  Is it a summary in some way?|date=December 2015}}
* "Pinker throws out the question of why women may or may not be allowed to be equal to men and posits a different one: why on earth do men get to be the standard? Why should females have the goal of meeting the male standard? This in itself denigrates females.... Pinker dares to posit the idea that women don't have the same preferences as men and therefore, might actually  choose different paths, not be forced into them by the patriarchy."  — Rebecca L. Burch, ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]''.&lt;ref name=Burch2008&gt;Burch (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[Pinker] delivers a well-referenced summary of the most up-to-date psychological research and social statistics in a cheerful style. The publicity the book has received, however, derives less from its style than its message." — [[Anne Campbell (academic)|Anne Campbell]], ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;ref name=Campbell2008&gt;Campbell (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra''''' is a 1945 musical composition by [[Benjamin Britten]] with a subtitle '''''Variations and [[Fugue]] on a Theme of [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'''''. It was based on the second movement, "Rondeau", of the ''[[Abdelazer]]'' suite. It was originally commissioned for the British educational documentary film called ''Instruments of the Orchestra'' released on 29 November 1946, directed by [[Muir Mathieson]] and featuring the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Malcolm Sargent]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b69f17167 "Instruments of the Orchestra"], British Film Institute, accessed 24 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Sargent also conducted the concert première on 15 October 1946 with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]] in the [[Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool]], England.

The work is one of the best-known pieces by the composer, and is often associated with two other works in the context of children's [[music education]]: [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]' ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''.{{citation needed|date = November 2013}}

This work, in the composer's own words, "is affectionately inscribed to the children of [[John Redcliffe-Maud, Baron Redcliffe-Maud|John]] and [[Jean Redcliffe-Maud|Jean Maud]]: [[Humphrey Maud|Humphrey]], Pamela, Caroline and Virginia, for their edification and entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KX-zz5p-Fp0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Essential Britten: A Pocket Guide for the Britten Centenary"], John Bridcut, accessed 14 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
''The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra'' is scored for symphony orchestra:

*''[[Woodwind instrument|Woodwinds]]'':  [[piccolo]], 2 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B flat and A]] and 2 [[bassoon]]s
*''[[Brass instrument|Brass]]'': 4 [[French horn|horns]] in F, 2 [[trumpet]]s in C, 3 [[trombone]]s (2 [[tenor trombone|tenors]] and 1 [[bass trombone|bass]]) and [[Tuba|bass tuba]]
*''[[Percussion]]'': [[timpani]],  [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s,  [[tambourine]],  [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]],  [[snare drum]],  [[cowbell]],  [[xylophone]], [[castanet]]s,  [[Gong|tamtam]], and  [[Whip (percussion)|whip]]
*''[[String instrument|Strings]]'':  [[harp]], first and second [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s and [[double bass]]es

==Structure==
The work is based on the [[Rondo|Rondeau]] from [[Henry Purcell]]'s [[incidental music]] to [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Abdelazer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/programme-notes-archive/18-april-2013-programme-notes|accessdate=3 August 2013|publisher=London Chamber Orchestra|title=Programme Notes|date=18 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130804060800/http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/programme-notes-archive/18-april-2013-programme-notes|archivedate=4 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is structured, in accordance with the plan of the original documentary film, as a way of showing off the tone colours and capacities of the various sections of the orchestra.

In the introduction, the theme is initially played by the entire orchestra, then by each major family of instruments of the orchestra: first the woodwinds, then the [[brass instrument|brass]], then the [[string instrument|strings]], and finally by the percussion. Each [[variation (music)|variation]] then features a particular instrument in depth, generally moving through each family from high to low (the order of the families is slightly different from the introduction). So, for example, the first variation features the piccolo and flutes; each member of the woodwind family then gets a variation, ending with the bassoon; and so on, through the strings, brass, and finally the percussion.

After the whole orchestra has been effectively taken to pieces in this way, it is reassembled using an original [[fugue]] which starts with the piccolo, followed by all the woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion in turn. Once everyone has entered, the brass are re-introduced (with a strike on the tamtam) with Purcell's original melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/special-events/20-march-2013-qmul/20-march-2013-programme-notes|accessdate=3 August 2013|publisher=London Chamber Orchestra|title=Programme Notes|date=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130804060802/http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/special-events/20-march-2013-qmul/20-march-2013-programme-notes|archivedate=4 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sections of the piece and instruments introduced by the variations are as follows.

;Theme: Allegro maestoso e largamente
:[[Tutti]], [[woodwinds]], [[brass instrument|brass]], [[String instrument|strings]], then [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]
;Variation A: Presto

;Fugue: Allegro molto

==Narration==
The narration for the documentary film was written by [[Eric Crozier]], the producer of the first production of Britten's opera ''[[Peter Grimes]]'',  and is sometimes spoken by the conductor or a separate speaker during performance of the piece. The composer also arranged a version without narration. The one without narration is more often recorded. The commentary often alters between recordings.

A new narration was written by Simon Butteriss for the Aldeburgh Festival and broadcast live by CBBC presenter Johny Pitts with the BBC Symphony Orchestra for the Britten 100 celebrations in 2013.

Comedian and author [[John Hodgman]] wrote a new narration of ''The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra'' in 2015 for a series of performances with the [[Boston Pops Orchestra|Boston Pops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wgbh.org/articles/John-Hodgman-in-the-Young-Persons-Guide-10425|title=John Hodgman in the Young Person's Guide: Boston Pops: WCRB: WGBH|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKuU2_Q7zH4|title=Excerpts from John Hodgman's Debut Narration with Boston Pops|first=|last=Boston Pops|date=14 May 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/guestlisted/2015/05/excerpts_from_john_hodgmans_debut_narration_with_boston_pops|title=Excerpts from John Hodgman's debut narration with Boston Pops|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theory of [[empirical knowledge]], '''the problem of the speckled hen''' is whether a single immediate [[observation]] of a [[wikt:speckle|speckle]]d [[chicken|hen]] provides a certain knowledge of the number of speckles observed. Clearly, this is not an isolated example, and therefore it is of fundamental nature.&lt;ref name=chis42&gt;[[Roderick Chisholm]], "The Problem of the Speckled Hen", ''Mind'' 51 (1942): pp.&amp;nbsp;368–373.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophically, this problem probes the limits of [[knowledge by acquaintance]]: one is unable to know with [[certainty]] the existence of determinate things in one's experience merely by the virtue of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/certainty/ "Certainty"], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roderick Chisholm]] attributes it to [[Gilbert Ryle]] suggesting to [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name=chis42/&gt; It is viewed as a critisicm of the view expressed by [[C. I. Lewis]] that there can never be "positive bafflement in the presence of the immediate, because there is here no question which fails to find an answer".&lt;ref&gt;C. I. Lewis, Mind and the World-Order, p. 128, As cited by Chisholm (1942). &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Heath]] remarks that this problem is one of the "descendants of [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]]'s '[[chiliagon]]' argument in the sixth of his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]]''". &lt;ref name=heath2008&gt;[[Joseph Heath]], ''Following the Rules: Practical Reasoning and Deontic Constraint'', Oxford: OUP, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;305, note&amp;nbsp;15).&lt;/ref&gt;

A. J. Ayer suggested that if we are unable to enumerate speckles accurately, then it is incorrect to suggest that the "sense-data" provides a definite number of speckles despite the fact that the hen does have a definite number of them, clearly outlined. In Ayers' words, speckles are enumerable only if in fact they have been enumerated. &lt;ref name=chis42/&gt;

A number of philosophers analyzed the merits of this proposition. Chisholm concludes that the problem of the speckled hen emphacises the fact that there are basic propositions ([[synthetic proposition]]s which do not refer beyond the content of the immediate experience) that are necessarily imprecise. &lt;ref name=chis42/&gt;
