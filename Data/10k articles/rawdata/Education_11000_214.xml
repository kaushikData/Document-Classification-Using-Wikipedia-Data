The '''1951 Army Cadets football team''' represented the [[United States Military Academy]] in the [[1951 college football season]]. Led by head coach [[Earl Blaik]], the team finished with a record of 2–7. The Cadets offense scored 116 points, while the defense allowed 183 points.

==Offseason==
In the offseason, Blaik was still agitated by the loss Army suffered to Navy in 1950. In addition, he was upset over the dismissal of [[General Douglas MacArthur]]. Sam Galiffa, who was part of the 1949 team, was now a decorated aide to General [[Matthew Ridgway]]. Galiffa arranged for members of the Army coaching staff to come to Japan and visit the troops.&lt;ref&gt;''When Pride Still Mattered'', David Maraniss, p.118, Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-84418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vince Lombardi and Doug Kenna first visited Tokyo and conducted several football clinics for the troops stationed there. Although defensive coordinator Murray Warmath helped the discharged players relocate to other schools, it was his last year at Army. He left at the end of the season to become the head coach for Mississippi State.&lt;ref&gt;''When Pride Still Mattered'', David Maraniss, p.131, Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-84418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honor code violation==
A massive honor code academic violation was revealed in the spring of 1951. There were accusations that football players were distributing unauthorized academic information.&lt;ref&gt;''When Pride Still Mattered, David Maraniss'', p.120, Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-84418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reported to Colonel [[Paul Harkins]] on April 2. It was later revealed that Red Blaik's son, Bob, was part of the honor code violation.&lt;ref&gt;''When Pride Still Mattered'', David Maraniss, p.123, Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-84418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 3, the violations were announced and several athletes were implicated in the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;''When Pride Still Mattered'', David Maraniss, p.130, Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-84418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph P. Kennedy]] spoke to assistant coach Doug Kenna, and he helped pay the way for several discharged players to attend [[Notre Dame Univerisity|Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;''When Pride Still Mattered'', David Maraniss, p.131, Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-84418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Blaik left Army for [[Colorado College]].&lt;ref&gt;''When Pride Still Mattered'', David Maraniss, p.131, Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-84418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the players that were discharged, three went on to careers in the [[National Football League]]: [[Al Pollard]], [[Gene Filipski]] and [[Ray Malavasi]]. Malavasi also become head coach of the [[Los Angeles Rams]].&lt;ref&gt;''When Pride Still Mattered'', David Maraniss, p.132, Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-84418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regular season==
The makeshift team that was assembled had no involvement in the honor violation, but they were still a reminder of it. After losing several games to Ivy League schools, Army defeated Columbia for its first win. The team received a congratulatory note from General Douglas MacArthur.&lt;ref&gt;''When Pride Still Mattered'', David Maraniss, p.138, Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-84418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In week 6 of the season, the Cadets played [[Frank Gifford]] and his USC Trojans squad. The game was played at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;''When Pride Still Mattered'', David Maraniss, p.139, Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-84418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Army–Navy game, the Cadets had a record of 2 wins and 6 losses. This was Blaik's only losing season at Army.&lt;ref&gt;When Pride Still Mattered, David Maraniss, p.139, Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-84418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Army–Navy game, Navy scored two touchdowns before Army even ran an offensive series.

'''826LA''' is a [[Los Angeles]]-based [[nonprofit]] organization dedicated to supporting students ages 6–18 with their creative and expository writing skills and helping teachers inspire their students to write. Programs are structured around the beliefs that great leaps in learning can happen with one-on-one attention and that strong writing skills are fundamental to future success. 826LA was founded in 2005 and is one of several chapters of 826 National. To serve students across Los Angeles' various regions, there are two locations: 826LA in [[Mar Vista, Los Angeles|Mar Vista]] and 826LA in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]]. A satellite site at Manual Arts Senior High School in South L.A. opened in 2013.

The 826LA Board of Directors consists of [[Grant DeVaul]], [[Dave Eggers]], [[Terena Thyne Eisner]], [[Jodie Evans]], [[DeAnna Gravillis]], Keith Knight, [[Louis Lucido]], [[Krystyn Madrigal]], [[Sylvie Rabineau]], and Brad Simpson.

There are seven other [[826 National]] chapters; [[San Francisco]] ([[826 Valencia]]), NYC ([[826NYC]]), Chicago ([[826CHI]]), Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti/Detroit ([[826michigan]]), Boston ([[826 Boston]]), New Orleans ([[826 New Orleans]]) and Washington, D.C. ([[826DC]]).

==The Time Travel Mart==
The Time Travel Mart exists at both 826LA in Mar Vista and 826LA in Echo Park, specializing in products imported from the past and future, such as Viking odorant, robot milk, robot toupees, robot emotions, mammoth chunks, and other time travel-themed oddities. The store and its initial line of products were conceived by writers Mac Barnett and Jon Korn, and graphic designer [[Stefan G. Bucher]]. The store also sells anthologies of work by 826LA writing students, new and back issues of ''[[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern]]'', ''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]'', ''[[Wholphin (DVD)|Wholphin]]'', and other McSweeney's publications. The store also sells a special series of [[Poketo]] wallets, celebrating the work of artists and students alike. The short stories written by 826LA students line the inside of Poketo's artist wallets, and then illustrated with a Poketo artist's interpretations of the stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://poketo.com/shop/projects/826-la-collaboration/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016041815/http://poketo.com/shop/projects/826-la-collaboration/ |date=October 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
[[File:After School Tutoring.jpg|thumb|After School Tutoring]]

'''After-School Tutoring'''

826LA offers free tutoring Monday through Thursday. Tutoring is offered with a focus on personalized instruction, offering local students individualized help with their homework. Students come to the writing labs, where they work with tutors to complete their daily assignments, and often to embark on ambitious writing projects: poems, stories, comic books, and self-initiated research. Student writing is compiled and published in chapbook form by two in-house publishing outfits: Dogtown Books (Mar Vista) and Echo Park Press (Echo Park).

'''Workshops'''

826LA offers writing workshops that cover a wide spectrum of subjects, all designed to strengthen students’ skills, foster their creativity, and give them an opportunity to execute projects that showcase their work. Working professionals teach all the offered workshops, and class sizes are kept small to ensure individualized attention. These workshops focus on a variety of topics. Recent classes have covered crafting college-application essays, designing imaginary countries, preparing for the [[SAT]], reviewing runway fashion, and writing love poetry from the perspective of leopards. In 2012, two workshops encouraged students to examine their daily lives and share their thoughts and experiences with students in Rwanda and India.

Among its many collaborative workshops is Sunday Afternoon For Kids, held at the [[Hammer Museum]] in which artists, writers and performers teach their craft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hammer.ucla.edu/programs/programs/cat/12 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217184825/http://hammer.ucla.edu/programs/programs/cat/12 |date=December 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular songwriting workshop brings together local musicians to collaborate with students in the songwriting process. In 2010, an edition of the workshop featured the band [[The Submarines]], and was titled "Songwriting With The Submarines." The students' songs were then recorded by professional musicians and released as an album called ''[[Chickens in Love]]'', featuring musicians such as [[The Submarines]], [[Fiona Apple]], [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]], [[Tim and Eric]], [[Crystal Antlers]], [[Cold War Kids]], [[Dum Dum Girls]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://filtermagazine.com/index.php/news/entry/826la_to_release_chickens_in_love_compilation/ |title=News - 826LA To Release ‘Chickens In Love’ Compilation |publisher=FILTER Magazine |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2014-06-29 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213044514/http://filtermagazine.com/index.php/news/entry/826la_to_release_chickens_in_love_compilation |archive-date=2010-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the BEAT |url=http://thebeatofyounglosangeles.blogspot.com/2010/03/do-it-pledge-to-826las-chickens-in-love.html |title=the BEAT: Do It.

'''In-Schools'''

826LA also sends volunteers into school throughout Los Angeles. Tutors support Los Angeles teachers in their classrooms, providing students with one-on-one attention and feedback as they work on various writing assignments: sonnets, biographies, [[University of California]] application essays, narrative essays, and more. In Spring 2006, [[Community Photoworks]] was created, an annual collaboration between 826LA and the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]. Seventh-graders students were taught the basics of photographic composition, explored Los Angeles with cameras, and wrote and polished artist statements. Their photographs and statements were displayed in a gallery exhibition in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/news/press/center/community_photoworks06.html |title=Community Photoworks (Press Release) |publisher=Getty.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Field Trips'''

In the mornings, classes from around Los Angeles visit the 826LA writing labs to participate in engaging and spirited field trips. Teachers can choose from various field-trip plans, such as workshops in screenwriting and journalism, or request a custom-designed program. Field trips are tailored to complement any teacher’s curriculum.

The most popular field trip is "Storytelling &amp; Bookmaking," in which classes collaborate to write stories for Mr. Barnacle, the never-seen, always-cranky publisher behind Barnacle &amp; Barnacle Books. With the help of several storytellers, an illustrator, and a typist, a class works together to create characters, a setting, and a plot for an original story. (A recent book chronicled the friendship between an injured mouse and a sandwich-making robot policeman. Others have featured time traveling tea-cup pigs, spaghetti monsters, and sentient planets). The action builds to a thrilling cliffhanger, and then each student has an opportunity to write an ending, create an illustration, bind his or her book, and walk away with the finished product. Barnacle is notoriously hard to please, but the students’ work manages to earn his enthusiastic approval every time.

==Events==
'''Dead Author Readings'''

Since 2008, 826LA has presented a series of Dead Author Readings, in which deceased wordsmiths such as [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] have read from their works and answered questions from the audience. The first iteration took place at the Echo Park location and featured comedian Patton Oswalt, who impersonated William Fryer Harvey and read from the works "The Clock" and "August Heat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://826la.org/WP/2008/07/24/dead-author-readings-patton-oswalt-is-william-fryer-harvey/ |title=Dead Author Readings: Patton Oswalt is William Fryer Harvey |publisher=826LA |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series then morphed into a collaboration with [[Paul F.

'''Writer's Panels'''

Starting in 2009, 826LA began running the Adult Writing Seminar Series, which was meant to provide insight for aspiring adult writers into the world of professional writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://826la.org/WP/2009/03/30/our-first-adult-seminar-a-huge-success/ |title=Our first adult seminar a huge success! |publisher=826LA |date=2009-03-30 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each workshop focused on a different genre and featured experienced writers at a panel discussion.&lt;ref&gt;http://events.ocregister.com/los_angeles_ca/events/show/172145785-826la-adult-writing-seminar-series&lt;/ref&gt; Early topics included music writing, food writing, comedy writing, and memoir writing.&lt;ref&gt;http://826la.org/WP/?s=adult+seminar&lt;/ref&gt; After appearing as a panelist for the Comedy Writing seminar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray |first=Alysia |url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/the-scene/events/Putting-the-Comedy-in-Comedy-Writing-92685429.html |title=Putting the Comedy in Comedy Writing &amp;#124; NBC Southern California |publisher=Nbclosangeles.com |date=2010-05-03 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Blacker returned to moderate the TV Writing seminar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://826la.org/WP/2009/10/05/adult-writing-seminar-series-tv-writing/ |title=Adult Writing Seminar Series: TV Writing |publisher=826LA |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the series has since become a collaboration with [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nerdist.com/2011/04/nerdist-theater-at-meltdown-roundup/ |title=Nerdist Theater at Meltdown Roundup « Nerdist |publisher=Nerdist.com |date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled the Nerdist Writer’s Panel, with Blacker as the sole moderator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdist.com/2011/05/hot-shows-happening-at-nerdist-theater-at-meltdown-this-week/ |title=Hot Shows Happening at Nerdist Theater at Meltdown This Week! « Nerdist |publisher=Nerdist.com |date=2011-05-16 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roar Shack Reading Series'''

In 2012, 826LA became host to the Roar Shack Reading Series founded by David Rocklin, a Los Angeles-based community of writers who come together on the second Sunday of every month. The event consists of featured readers and a live write. Featured readers in the past have included Natashia Deón (author of ''Grace: A Novel''), [[Martin Pousson]] (author of ''Black Sheep Boy''), and [[Brian Sonia-Wallace]] (poet). For each live write, an audience suggested prompt is assigned and two writers are chosen to write and perform.

{{Advanced Placement}}

'''Advanced Placement Microeconomics''' (or '''AP Microeconomics''') is a course offered by the College Board as part of the Advanced Placement Program for high school students interested in college-level coursework in microeconomics and/or gaining [[advanced standing]] in [[college]]. The course begins with a study of fundamental economic concepts such as [[scarcity]], [[opportunity cost]]s, production possibilities, specialization, and [[Transfer credit|comparative advantage]]. Major topics include the nature of functions of product markets; factor markets; and efficiency, equity, and the role of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="80233">[[File:Smith College Hood.jpg|thumb|right|Contemporary bachelor gown and hood for [[Smith College]].]]
'''Academic regalia in the United States''' has a history going back to the [[colonial colleges]] era. It has been most influenced by the [[academic dress]] traditions of Europe. There is an Inter-Collegiate Code that sets out a detailed uniform scheme of academic regalia that is voluntarily followed by many, though not all institutions entirely adhere to it.

==Gowns and robes==
[[File:Jacob1207b.JPG|thumb|American academic dress is typically closed at the front and is properly worn with the prescribed cap and hood. On the baccalaureate dress shown, other items, such as scarves, stoles or cords may be seen.]]

[[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|master's]] gowns in the United States are similar to some of their counterparts in the United Kingdom, particularly [[Oxford]]. The main differences are that the bachelor's gown is designed to be worn closed and that the sleeves of the modern gown are square at the end instead of pointed&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, "King's Crowns: The History of Academic Dress at King's College and Columbia University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Code calls for. The master's gown sleeve is [[rectangle|oblong]] and, though the base of the sleeve hangs down, it is square-cut at the rear part of the oblong shape.  The front part has an arc cut away, and there is a slit for the wrist opening (which before 1960 was located at the elbow as on British gowns), but the rest of the arc is closed. The shape is evocative of the square-cut [[liripipe]] incorporated into many academic hoods (''see'', below).  The master's gown is designed to be worn open or closed.&lt;ref name="Eugene Sullivan 2001"/&gt;

[[Doctorate|Doctoral]] gowns are typically black, although some schools use gowns in the [[school colors|school's colors]].&lt;ref name="Eugene Sullivan 2001"/&gt; The Code calls for the outside shell of the hood to remain black in that case.  Doctoral gowns have bell sleeves with three velvet bands on them and velvet facing on the front of the gown.  The Code calls for the gown trim to be either black or the color designated for the field of study in which the doctorate is earned, with the proviso that the degree of [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) uses the dark blue velvet of philosophy regardless of the particular field studied.  (For example, a Ph.D. in theology would wear velvet gown trim in dark blue, a [[Doctor of Theology]] (Th.D.) would wear scarlet trim, or either might choose black.)  The robes have full sleeves instead of the bell sleeves of the bachelor's gown. Some gowns expose a [[necktie]] or [[cravat]] when closed.  They are designed to be worn open or closed in the front.&lt;ref name="Eugene Sullivan 2001"/&gt;

Members of the Board of Trustees or other governing body officers of a college or university, regardless of their degrees, are entitled to wear doctor's gowns, faced only with black velvet and black velvet bars on the sleeves.  However, their hoods (''see'', below) may be only those of the degree actually held by the wearer (or one specially prescribed by the institution).&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sullivan, ‘Academic Costume Code and Ceremony Guide,’ American Colleges and Universities, 16 ed., New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2001, p. 1860, ''Some Permissible Exceptions.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The color standardization for the outside shell of the hood as black provides flexibility of use and helps facilitate this practice.

==Hoods==
[[File:Caltech hood.jpg|thumb|The doctoral hood of the [[California Institute of Technology]].  Note the blue velvet ''trim'' indicating philosophy; for degrees other than the Ph.D., the trim's color corresponds to the subject of the degree being awarded.  The ''interior lining'' shows the [[school colors]], in this case orange and white.]]

The hood's coloring and size represents the type and subject of degree earned, as well as the institution from which it was awarded. Though no shape is specified in the Code, American bachelors and masters usually wear the Wales simple shape ([s5] in the [[Groves classification system]]) with a split salmon cut; doctors wear the same shape but with "panels" attached to the sides.&lt;ref name="Stephen Wolgast 2009 pp. 16-17"/&gt;

* '''Shell''' - The Code calls for the shell material of the hood to match the robe, and for the color to be black regardless of the color of the robe being worn.&lt;ref name=SullivanHoods&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Hoods''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Interior lining''' - The interior lining, generally satin, is worn so as to display the colors of the institution from which the wearer received the degree; if more than one color is used, they are usually in the pattern of [[chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] or equal divisions.&lt;ref name=SullivanTrimmingsGowns&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Hoods'';''Linings''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Trim''' - The outer edge of the cowl (around the opening if one would put it over one's head if wearing it as an actual hood) is [[trim (sewing)|trimmed]] in [[velvet]] or [[velveteen]].&lt;ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods/&gt; The width of the trim is 2&amp;nbsp;inches, 3&amp;nbsp;inches, and 5&amp;nbsp;inches for the bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees, respectively.&lt;ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods/&gt;  In most American colleges and universities, the color of the velvet hood trimming is distinctive of the academic field, or as closely related as possible, to which the degree earned pertains (see ''[[Academic regalia in the United States#Intercollegiate colors|Inter-Collegiate colors]]'', below).&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sullivan, ‘Academic Costume Code and Ceremony Guide,’ American Colleges and Universities, 16 ed., New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2001, p. 1860, ''Additional Guidance on Costume.''&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, one who has earned a [[Master of Arts]] in Journalism would wear velvet trim of crimson to signify "journalism", rather than white to represent "[[liberal arts|arts]]." Trim colors should not be combined or displayed together in any way to attempt to indicate more than one academic field.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sullivan, ‘Academic Costume Code and Ceremony Guide,’ American Colleges and Universities, 16 ed., New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2001, p. 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Length''' - The length of the hood will vary with the level of academic achievement as well: bachelors wear a 3 foot length, masters a 3.5 foot length, and doctors a 4 foot length.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sullivan, ‘Academic Costume Code and Ceremony Guide,’ American Colleges and Universities, 16 ed., New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2001, p. 1860, ''Hoods'';''Length.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Only the doctoral hood will have "panels" at the sides of the hood that lie [[cape]]-like across the back.

Candidates may have the hood ceremoniously placed upon them, as is done at some British universities, or a college or school may 'self-hood' ''en masse'' at the appropriate time during the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/download/downloads/id/1463/information_for_masters_and_doctoral_candidates.pdf|University Commencement Guide for master’s and doctoral candidates | May 2015].  Accessed 05/26/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Code allows for the wearing of the hood into the commencement ceremony as part of the academic procession, but only if neither of the two procedures above are being employed.&lt;ref name=SullivanWearing&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Wearing the Costume''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Code also states: "It is quite appropriate for the bachelor's gown to be worn without a hood."&lt;ref name="Eugene Sullivan 2001"/&gt;  Many institutions, particularly larger ones, have therefore dispensed with the bachelor's hood at commencement ceremonies altogether, though a graduate is still entitled to wear one once the degree is conferred.&lt;ref name="Eugene Sullivan 2001"/&gt;  Both honorary and earned doctoral degrees are very often conferred by the highest academic officer of an institution bestowing the appropriate hood at the [[podium]], regardless of the procedure being followed for other candidates at the ceremony.

Only one hood should be worn at any given time.&lt;ref name=SullivanWearing/&gt;  The regalia indicating the highest degree attained is usually worn, though the Code seems to allow for a graduate to revert for some occasion to the entire academic costume of a lesser degree earned.   Those who hold multiple degrees of the same level (i.e. more than one master's or doctorate degree) may wear at any given time the regalia, in its entirety, of any one degree earned.&lt;ref name=SullivanWearing /&gt; The Code does not allow for 'mixing-and-matching.'  The one exception is for officers of the academic institution who, while wearing a doctoral gown of the University being served, may display one hood from any degree earned from any institution.(see ''[[#Academic robes (gowns)|Academic robes]]'', above).&lt;ref name=SullivanExceptions&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Some Permissible Exceptions''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Headwear==

Headwear is an important component of cap-and-gown, and the academic costume is not complete without it. The headwear may vary with the level of academic achievement and, to some extent, on the individual academic institution's specifications.

*'''Caps''' - The [[mortarboard]] cap is recommended in the Code, and the material required to match the gown, with the exception that doctoral regalia can instead use a velvet four-, six-, or eight-sided [[tam (cap)|tam]], but the four-sided mortarboard-shaped tam in velvet is what the Code seems to recommend here; the only color called for is black, in all cases&lt;ref name=SullivanCaps&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Caps''&lt;/ref&gt;  During graduation ceremonies in the United States, both women and men wear caps, and both women and men wear their caps indoors throughout most of the ceremony, except for men during a [[baccalaureate service]], the [[national anthem]] ("[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]"), any [[benediction]] that may be offered by a [[chaplain]] or other authority, and sometimes the singing of the [[alma mater]] if the local custom requires it.&lt;ref name=SullivanWearing /&gt;  Although military and civil uniform, national costume, and clerical garb etc. are worn beneath the academic robe, traditionally only the [[biretta]] in conjunction with clerical garb will replace the academic cap.  All other costumes forgo the normal headwear in favor of the appropriate academic version.
*'''Tassel''' - The tassel worn on the mortarboard or a tam seems to provide, by tradition, the greatest opportunity for latitude in American academic dress.  It has been black, or represented the university's colors, or the colors of the specific college, or the discipline. The tassel has also been used to indicate membership in national [[honor society|honor societies]] or other awards. However, strictly speaking, the Code states that "The tassel should be black or the color appropriate to the subject," and only makes an exception for the gold tassel, which is reserved for those entitled to wear the doctoral gown. Only one tassel is worn at a time.&lt;ref name=SullivanCaps /&gt;

There is at some colleges and universities a practice of moving the tassel from one side to the other on graduating, but this is a modern innovation that would be impractical out of doors due to the vagaries of the wind. However, this mark of transition to graduate status has the benefit of taking less time than more traditional indicators such as the individual conferring of the hood or a complete change of dress part-way through the ceremony (as at Oxford in the United Kingdom). In such universities it is common for undergraduates to begin the commencement ceremony with their tassels on the right. Switching the tassel to the left may be done individually or as a group. For doctoral and masters students, the tassel commonly begins and remains on the left.&lt;ref name=SullivanWearing /&gt;

==Other adornments==

A number of other items such as [[honor cords|cords]], [[academic stole|stoles]], [[aiguillette]]s, representing various academic achievements or other honors are also worn at the discretion of some degree-granting institutions.  The Code disapproves of their use on or over academic regalia, saying that "shoes and other articles of visible apparel worn by graduates should be of dark colors that harmonize with the academic costume. Nothing else should be worn on the academic gown."&lt;ref name=SullivanWearing /&gt;

Apparel and tokens representing awards and honors are not considered a component of academic dress, not only because the Code suggests avoiding them, but also because (a) they are often worn without the defining cap and gown, and (b) they are usually not worn by a graduate with academic robes after the Commencement year in which the honor was awarded. Nevertheless, they are often seen with academic regalia in the United States, and are therefore mentioned here.

*'''Medals/medallions''' - When worn about the neck, [[medals]]/medallions may not be in conflict with the Code if worn beneath the hood and visible only with the gown open.  The Code's exception is only for special regalia for a chief [[Marshal#Ceremonial|marshal]], the university or college president, etc. which may include medallions or other devices symbolic of the office.&lt;ref name="SullivanExceptions"/&gt; As a medallion in this case is symbolic of the office and not academic achievement, once the wearer leaves the office they are no longer entitled to wear it.  Therefore, it is not a component of an individual's academic regalia, but a component of the regalia for the office.
*'''Honor cord''' - [[Honor cords]] usually consist of twisted cords with tassels on either end.  They are sometimes awarded for various academic achievements, or to members of [[honor society|honor societies]].  Often, cords come in pairs with a knot in the middle to hold them together.  Sashes, stoles, or medallions are also awarded in place of cords.  Any of these items are customarily worn with non-academic attire, as well.  With cap and gown, and hood when utilized, some educational institutions have permitted these cords to complement the regalia of a [[high school]] or [[university]] candidate, ignoring the ACE Code to the contrary.  Unlike hoods, tassels and stoles, custom allows more than one cord to be worn at the same time.

== Intercollegiate colors ==
The colors allocated to the various fields of learning have been largely standardized in the United States by the Intercollegiate Bureau of Academic Costume,&lt;ref&gt;The History of Academic Costume in America. Cotrell &amp; Leonard, Albany, N.Y., Intercollegiate bureau of academic costume. Printed and distributed for the Intercollegiate bureau of academic costume, by Cotrell &amp; Leonard, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted by the American Council on Education in its ''Academic Costume Code.''&lt;ref name=SullivanTrimmingsGowns /&gt;  The color assigned to a given hood trim and/or tassels and—where appropriate—gown facings, should be as closely related as possible to the field studied.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Additional Guidance on Costume''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one who has earned a degree in [[animal husbandry]] would wear the maize of agriculture, as no color is specific to the subject of animal husbandry, and it is generally included within the broader field of agriculture.  Less simply, [[mathematics]] is traditionally among the liberal arts, which are represented by white, but can also be considered a [[formal science]], represented by golden yellow for science.

The codified colors associated with the different [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] are as shown below:

&lt;!-- Some of the links for the color names are different than the color names given by the ACE. This is because the links take the reader to the color closest to that actually used by the ACE and academic hood manufacturers. So, when reading the article, one will see a close representation of the color and the ACE name for the color, and can click on the name to be taken to the article on the actual color used. --&gt;

The code calls for a graduate to display the color of the subject of the degree obtained, not the degree itself.&lt;ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, Hoods, ''Trimmings''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a graduate is awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree in business, the trimming should be drab, representing commerce/accountancy/business, rather than white, representing the broader arts/letters/humanities; if the BA were in economics, the trim would be copper; if in environmental studies, it would be russet, and so on. If the BA were in a language, a subject within the humanities and not otherwise assigned a unique color, the velvet would indeed be white.  Similarly, if a [[Bachelor of Science]] (BS) degree is awarded for physics, the velvet trim should be golden yellow, representing physics as one of the [[natural science]]s; however, if the BS were in engineering, the trim would be orange, or if in education, the trim would be light blue. The same method is true of master's degrees and doctorates: a [[Master of Public Administration]] in Science and Technology should show trim of golden yellow for science, not peacock blue for public administration; conversely a [[Master of Science]] in Public Administration should display peacock blue trim for public administration and not golden yellow for science.

Additionally, it is problematic when a field of study that does not have its own color assigned to it has been considered to be included in more than one discipline, which are represented by different colors. For example, history has traditionally been considered as among the humanities, represented by white, but is also considered a [[social science]], which can be represented by golden yellow.  This is often addressed by an academic institution allowing the degree earned to influence - but not ''determine'' - color assignment.  For instance, a Bachelor of Arts graduate in history might display white, while a Bachelor of Science graduate in history at the same institution could properly display golden yellow, and ''vice versa''.  This then can create confusion in the first instance by appearing to display colors based on the degree earned rather than, as stipulated in the Code, the academic field studied.

In 1986, the American Council on Education updated the Code and added the following sentence clarifying the use of the color dark blue for the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree, which is awarded in any number of fields:  &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the case of the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree, the dark blue color is used to represent the mastery of the discipline of learning and scholarship in any field that is attested to by the awarding of the degree, and it is not intended to represent the field of philosophy."&lt;ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[doctorate]] other than the Ph.D. will be represented by the colors indicated above. For example, the [[Doctor of Education]] (Ed.D.) in Public Health should display salmon pink for public health, not light blue for education, and the [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH) in Public Administration should display peacock blue for public administration, not salmon pink for public health. The [[Doctor of Engineering]] (D.Eng.) degree, if no further specialization was made, should be represented by orange, and the [[Doctor of Ministry]] (D.Min.) by scarlet if no further specialization, etc.

==History==
[[File:James McCulloch in undergraduate robes.JPG|thumb|An American student in undergraduate academic dress during the colonial period.]]

===Colonial period===
The practice of wearing academic regalia in what is now the United States dates to the [[Colonial Colleges]] period, and was heavily influenced by European practices and styles.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;Sullivan.  The Academic Costume Code, ''Historical Overview''&lt;/ref&gt; Students at the  College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) and at King's College (now [[Columbia University|Columbia]]) were required to wear their "college habits" at all times starting in 1755 at Princeton&lt;ref&gt;Donald Drakeman, "'Peculiar Habits': Academic Costumes at Princeton University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1763 at Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, "King's Crowns: The History of Academic Dress at King's College and Columbia University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly after the beginning of the nineteenth century, however, academic dress was rarely worn on a daily basis, according to contemporary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Hoffmann, "Crow's Feet and Crimson: Academic Dress at Harvard," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), pp. 43-4; Donald Drakeman, "'Peculiar Habits': Academic Costumes at Princeton University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 60; Stephen Wolgast, "King's Crowns: The History of Academic Dress at King's College and Columbia University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth century===
After the [[American Civil War]], academic dress was generally only worn at ceremonies or when representing the institution,&lt;ref name='Princeton Regalia 5-6'&gt;{{cite book | last = Smagorinsky| first = Margaret |title=The Regalia of Princeton University: Pomp, Circumstance, and Accountrements of Academia (sic)|publisher=Princeton University Office of Printing and Mailing |location=[[Princeton, New Jersey]] |year=1994|isbn= |pages=5–6 |doi= }} [http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~ptoniana/regalia.pdf Online Edition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521175636/http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~ptoniana/regalia.pdf |date=May 21, 2011 }}. Retrieved: 2011-04-05&lt;/ref&gt; although in some instances the practice has persisted, such as at [[Sewanee: The University of the South|Sewanee]], where members of one student society continue to wear the gown to class.&lt;ref name='Sewanee Gownsmen'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sewanee.edu/og/about |title=About - Sewanee: The University of the South |accessdate=2011-04-05 |last= |first= |date=n.d. |publisher=Sewanee: The University of the South |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529201410/http://www.sewanee.edu/og/about |archivedate=2010-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although universities that adopted academic dress assigned specific meanings to them, there was no consistency among the various sets of rules. For example, when the [[University of Pennsylvania]] adopted its academic dress statute in April 1887 it abolished hoods. Instead, it assigned eight faculty colors&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 36 and Chart 1.&lt;/ref&gt; that were shown on the gowns’ yokes (the portion over the shoulders).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, compiler, "Timeline of Developments in Academic Dress in North America," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia adopted an academic dress statute in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, "King's Crowns: The History of Academic Dress at King's College and Columbia University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  It included the first known American inclusion of the three velvet stripes on the sleeves. Both doctors and masters wore black gowns with sleeve stripes and facing; for masters the velvet was always black, and for doctors the velvet was always purple. Columbia also approved a scarlet gown for doctors’ use on “festal” occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, "King's Crowns: The History of Academic Dress at King's College and Columbia University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 96 and Fig. 2, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, three stripes adorned the sleeve of a gown depicted in an invitation to Class Day ceremonies at Columbia in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, "King's Crowns: The History of Academic Dress at King's College and Columbia University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

When New York University adopted its own academic dress in 1891, like Columbia it added the three sleeve stripes but permitted them to be worn in the university’s faculty colors. It also adopted the Edinburgh shape in the ([s4] in the [[Groves classification system]]) for its hoods.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), pp. 10-11, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Although NYU gave up this shape when the Code was adopted, Harvard adopted it for all its graduates in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Hoffmann, "Crow's Feet and Crimson: Academic Dress at Harvard," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Also starting in 1891, Princeton graduates wore a black gown with an orange stripe between the shoulders, making it perhaps the first American gown in a university’s corporate colors.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

These weren’t the only pre-Code gowns in America that departed from black. Hampden-Sydney started using gray gowns in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, compiler, “Timeline of Developments in Academic Dress in North America,” Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of the South approved gowns for its higher degrees in the same shapes and colors of Oxford. However, since the university at the time conferred only honorary master’s and doctoral degrees, it’s unknown if anyone ever wore the Oxford-style gowns.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 11 and Chart 2, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume====
[[File:ICC Master Gown and Hood.JPG|thumb|right|An American master's gown from 1911 with the slit located at the elbow rather than at the crescent arc and hood in [[Groves classification system|''[s1] simple'' shape]].]]

In June 1893, the trustees of Princeton appointed one of their members, John J. McCook, to look into creating an academic costume that showed the wearer’s degree, faculty, and alma mater, and to discuss the concept with Columbia, Yale, Harvard and other universities with the goal being “the adoption of a uniform academic costume.”&lt;ref&gt;Donald Drakeman, "'Peculiar Habits': Academic Costumes at Princeton University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia hosted the meeting with delegates from Princeton (McCook), Yale and New York University attending, and as a “technical adviser” Gardner Cotrell Leonard, whose Albany, N.Y., firm manufactured academic dress. (Harvard waited until 1902 to adopt its academic dress statute, which is recognizable for its inclusion of the university’s nineteenth-century crows’ feet and the use of the Edinburgh simple shape hood [s4]).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Hoffmann, "Crow's Feet and Crimson: Academic Dress at Harvard," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), pp. 44 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting took place in either 1894 or 1895 and adopted the Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume on March 16, 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Armagost, “University Uniforms: The Standardization of Academic Dress in the United States,” Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was based on Columbia’s existing statute,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and prescribed the cut and style and materials of the gowns, as well as eight colors representing fields of learning.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times. "Gowns for College Men; Academic Costumes in American Universities (1896): Plan to Secure a Uniform Practice in the Use of the Caps and Gowns in This Country So that the Degree of the Wearer, the Faculty Under Whom It Was Obtained, and the Institution Conferring It May Be Readily Seen."  Sunday, April 26, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; The descriptions, however, are vague compared to the descriptions of academic costume in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;William Gibson, “The Regulation of Undergraduate Dress at Oxford and Cambridge, 1660-1832,” [[Burgon Society]] Annual 2004, and W. N. Hargreaves-Mawdsley, A History of Academical Dress in Europe until the End of the Eighteenth Century (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963; reprinted Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1978); best read with Alex Kerr, “Hargreaves-Mawdsley's History of Academical Dress and the Pictorial Evidence for Great Britain and Ireland: Notes and Corrections,” Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 8 (2008), pp. 106-50.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, no particular shape of hood was specified in the Code (nor has one ever been). The version Americans typically wear is the Wales simple shape [s5] with a split-salmon cut. In the late nineteenth century it was the shape worn by Oxford bachelors; today it is worn by graduates of the University of Wales.&lt;ref name="Stephen Wolgast 2009 pp. 16-17"&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1895, several changes have been made to the Code.

===Twentieth century===

====1932====

In 1932 the [[American Council on Education]] (ACE) authorized the appointment of a committee "to determine whether revision and completion of the academic code adopted by the conference of the colleges and universities in 1895 is desirable at this time, and, if so, to draft a revised code and present a plan for submitting the code to the consideration of the institutional members of the Council." The committee essentially adopted the Code in whole&lt;ref name="Stephen Wolgast 2009 p. 23"&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and changed it in two ways:

*The master’s hood shrank from four feet to three-and-one-half feet; and
*The chevron was added to the Code to be used in the hood lining when more than one color appeared.

====1959====

A Committee on Academic Costumes and Ceremonies, appointed by the American Council on Education in 1959, again reviewed the academic dress code and made several changes. They took effect as of 1960. The significant alterations included:&lt;ref name="Stephen Wolgast 2009 p. 23"/&gt;

*Moving the arm slit on the master’s gown sleeve from above the elbow to the wrist;
*Specifying that the arc cut from the master’s gown sleeve was in the front; 
*Permitting masters’ and doctors’ gowns to be worn either closed or opened;
*The first connection of color to discipline instead of faculty (i.e. a Master of Science in Agriculture wears maize, not golden yellow);
*Adding soft, square caps for women as an alternative to the mortarboard;
*Tassels in colors other than black; and
*The suggestion that hoods be worn by candidates for the degrees they were about to receive (so that they would not have to be hooded individually).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), pp. 25-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
These changes were approved in March 1959. In April, the Committee approved the use of maroon for home economy. The color has never been included in any edition of the ACE book.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|socio-political upheaval of the 1960s]] in many [[Western cultures]], eschewing academic regalia became a popular means of demonstrating [[anti-establishment]] views, particularly in response to the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States. [[Protests against the Vietnam War|Student protests]], which had the effect of cancelling graduation ceremonies at some American universities, led to a general relaxing of protocols on academic attire and ceremonial pageantry.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} After the war, academic regalia continued to be shunned by some who considered it a symbol of [[elitism]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  However, since the 1980s, academic regalia has been in resurgence.  Some colleges or academic departments allow graduating students to vote on whether or not to wear academic regalia at graduation ceremonies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

====1973====
More changes were approved by the Committee in 1973, following the “large numbers of requests for advice about academic dress” received by the Committee.&lt;ref name="Stephen Wolgast 2009 p. 29"&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The important changes, which first appeared in the 11th edition of the ACE book (published in 1973), include:
*Permitting for associates’ degrees a “flat shield hood,” which properly speaking is a cape, and which was first used by Columbia for its bachelors and doctors in 1963;
*Permitting for six-year specialist degrees, such as the Master of Arts in Teaching, a hood whose length was 3 feet 9 inches (which is halfway between the master’s 3-foot, 6-inch hood and the doctor’s 4-foot hood), and whose edging was 4 inches wide (which is halfway between the three inches for masters and five inches for doctors); and
*The addition of an “alternate color” for Business, Accountancy and Commerce: Sapphire blue. Its use was recommended against in the description, and no explanation for its addition was mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th edition also included a contradiction in selecting a faculty color. Since 1960 the color was to be connected not to the title of the degree but to the discipline studied (e.g. a Bachelor of Arts in Music would wear pink, for music, instead of white etc.). That suggestion remained in the 11th edition, but in another paragraph was the opposite direction: “For the hood, the border [i.e. the edging of the cowl] should be white if the degree is awarded in arts (B.A. or M.A.), golden yellow if in science (B.S. or M.S.).”&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Doctors had similarly confusing advice. Interdisciplinary doctorates could wear the faculty color of any of a number of fields. “Thus,” the 1973 Code states, “urban affairs may be distinguished by copper (economics), peacock blue (public administration), or another field already assigned ...”&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1987====

Doctoral degrees were clarified in 1987 when all Ph.D. graduates were to wear dark blue as their faculty color. While this was the most visible of changes that took effect that year, it was hardly the only one, and it wasn’t the only change that involved color. Some of the other changes included:&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast et al., "The Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume: An Introduction," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dropping the specification of material for the gown and hood (it had been cotton, silk or rayon); 
*Eliminating sapphire blue as an alternative color for Commerce, Accountancy and Business;
*Removing the women’s soft, square cap as an alternative to the mortarboard;
*Pointing out that “[n]othing else should be worn on the academic gown” aside from the prescribed costume;
*Omitting the light blue gown for the Associate of Arts in teacher education, while leaving grey gowns as the suggestion for all associates’ degrees.

Although readers of the Code may believe it to be an enforceable edict, the current version of the Code points out its permissive nature:
“… it is impossible (and probably undesirable) to lay down enforceable rules with respect to academic costume. The governing force is tradition and the continuity of academic symbols from the Middle Ages. The tradition should be departed from as little as possible … ”&lt;ref name="Eugene Sullivan 2001"&gt;Eugene Sullivan, ‘Academic Costume Code and Ceremony Guide,’ American Colleges and Universities, 16 ed., New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2001, p. 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Committee wrote a memo in 1967 that makes the point directly, pointing out that “the general guidelines are as stated and should not be interpreted as supported by highly detailed and hard-and-fast regulations on file in some central place.”&lt;ref name="Stephen Wolgast 2009 p. 29"/&gt;

===Twenty-first century===

Although today in the U.S. academic dress is rarely worn outside [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremonies or other academic rituals such as [[encaenia]] and [[baccalaureate service]]s, those graduation ceremonies have gained in popularity and have expanded to high school graduations, middle school, elementary school and even kindergarten graduation ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhymeuniversity.com |title=Kindergarten graduation in the United States |publisher=Rhymeuniversity.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100510095619/http://rhymeuniversity.com/| archivedate= 10 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special academic regalia of United States universities==
More than 400 universities in the U.S. grant the doctoral degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-institutions-us.html] U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Network for Education Information, Institutions and Programs.&lt;/ref&gt; Of them, more than 125 use academic dress for their doctors that varies from the guidelines found in the code.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Boven, “American Universities’ Departure from the Academic Costume Code,” Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities limit their unique costumes for doctors only; others provide it for doctors and masters; some provide it for the upper degrees and bachelors too.

Unique academic dress typically separates itself from the Code’s standards through color. While the Code sanctions black for gowns at the bachelor’s level and above (and grey gowns for the associate’s degree), several American colleges in the late nineteenth century had adopted colored academic dress (see ''History'', above). When the Code was approved in 1895, black became the only approved color for gowns, caps, and hood shells.

As early as 1912, however, uniformity was challenged. Brown adopted mortarboards for its trustees and fellows in the university color, seal brown.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, "King's Crowns: The History of Academic Dress at King's College and Columbia University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 Yale began using Yale blue gowns for its masters’ and doctors’ academic dress.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, "King's Crowns: The History of Academic Dress at King's College and Columbia University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Syracuse began using orange gowns for its academic officers, but not for graduates.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, "King's Crowns: The History of Academic Dress at King's College and Columbia University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Rochester created a red gown for its president and a black gown with gold trim for some of its officers in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, compiler, “Timeline of Developments in Academic Dress in North America,” Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; In the next year, Harvard adopted crimson for the gowns of its Ph.D. holders. (Later, all Harvard doctors but the J.D. would wear the crimson gown.)&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Hoffmann, "Crow's Feet and Crimson: Academic Dress at Harvard," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Ivy League universities soon followed suit. Princeton adopted a doctoral gown in 1960 whose shape differed slightly from the Code’s standard. The sleeves were somewhat shorter and they were lined in orange; the gown was black with orange trim.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Drakeman, "'Peculiar Habits': Academic Costumes at Princeton University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard shape was recently authorized by Princeton; both are permitted today.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Drakeman, "'Peculiar Habits': Academic Costumes at Princeton University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia debuted its light blue gowns for all graduates in 1963, following failed attempts in 1948 and 1958 to adopt colored gowns.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, "King's Crowns: The History of Academic Dress at King's College and Columbia University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The gowns Columbia has used since 1963, designed by [[Jacques Barzun]], have a pair of crowns below the yoke; on the bachelor’s and master’s gown they are embroidered onto a tab while they are embroidered directly into the velvet facing of the doctoral gown.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wolgast, "King's Crowns: The History of Academic Dress at King's College and Columbia University," Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania’s distinctive doctoral gown was first used in 1964. It is red but the lower ends of the sleeves are blue.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Boven, “American Universities’ Departure from the Academic Costume Code,” Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deviations from the Code generally fall into one of five categories.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Boven, “American Universities’ Departure from the Academic Costume Code,” Transactions of the [[Burgon Society]] 9 (2009), pp. 160-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to doctoral gowns, these are:
*Adding piping, usually in the university color, around the velvet trim on a black gown;
*Changing the velvet trim to the university color;
*Changing the gown to the university color;
*Changing both the color of the gown and the color of the velvet trim to other than black or faculty color; or
*Changing the shape of the gown and/or its trim (e.g. [[Academic dress of Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Stony Brook University]]).

[[File:Siège de la Société d'histoire des Juifs de Tunisie.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the seat of the [[History of the Jews in Tunisia|Société d'histoire des Juifs de Tunisie]] and the ''Alliance israélite universelle'' in [[Paris]].]]

The '''''Alliance israélite universelle''''' ({{lang-he-n|כל ישראל חברים}}) is a [[Paris]]-based international [[Jew]]ish organization founded in 1860 by the French statesman [[Adolphe Crémieux]] to safeguard the [[human rights]] of [[Jew]]s around the world. The organization promotes the ideals of Jewish [[self-defense]] and [[self-sufficiency]] through [[education]] and [[professional development]].  It is noted for establishing French-language schools for Jewish children throughout the Mediterranean in the 19th and early 20th century.

The motto of the organization is the Jewish [[rabbi]]nic injunction ''Kol yisrael arevim ze laze'' ({{Hebrew|כל ישראל ערבים זה לזה}}), translated into [[French language|French]] as ''Tous les israélites sont solidaires les uns des autres'' ("All Jews bear responsibility for one another").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G9MeXaTrjEQC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171 ''Sacred Bonds of Solidarity: The Rise of Jewish Internationalism in Nineteenth-Century France,'' Lisa Moses Leff ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Adolphe Crémieux by Lecomte du Nouy.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Adolphe Crémieux]], founder of the Alliance&lt;/center&gt;]]

In 1860, Alliance Israelite Universelle embarked on a "[[civilizing mission|mission civilisatrice]]" to advance the Jews of the [[Middle East]] through French education and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ENfjCk1IZBcC&amp;pg=PA49 ''The Dispersion of Egyptian Jewry'', Joel Beinin]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in [[Paris]],&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{NIE|wstitle=Alliance Israelite Universelle|year=1905|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened its first school in [[Tetouan]], [[Morocco]] in 1862.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3kbU4BIAcrQC&amp;pg=PA29 ''A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict'',  Mark A. Tessler]&lt;/ref&gt; The original members of the society were Jews, and by far the largest number of its members belong to that faith, but the association has enjoyed at all times the sympathy and cooperation of many prominent Christians. As outlined in its prospectus, the program of the society included the emancipation of the Jews from oppressive and discriminating laws, political disabilities, and defense of them in those countries where they were subjected to persecution.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

For the attainment of its objectives, the society proposed to carry on a campaign of education through the press and by the publication of works on the history and life of the Jews. In the beginning, however, the course of action adopted by the society for bringing relief to their oppressed brethren in other countries was to secure the intercession of friendly governments in their behalf. Thus, as early as 1867 the governments of [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]] made the renewal of existing treaties with [[Switzerland]] conditional upon that country's granting full civil and political rights to the Jews. In 1878, representatives of the Alliance laid the condition of the Jews in the Balkan Peninsula before the [[Congress of Berlin]], as a result of which the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] stipulated that in [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], and [[Bulgaria]] no discrimination should be made against any religion in the distribution of [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

===Schools===
[[File:Portail AIU.JPG|thumb|Gate of the school of Alliance israélite universelle (1882), on [[Jaffa Road]] in [[Jerusalem]]]] 
Over time, the activity of the Alliance became more focused on education and especially improving the welfare of Jews.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; In 1864, an Alliance school opened in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/4926183/The_Elite_the_Effendiyya_and_the_Growth_of_Nationalism_and_Pan-Arabism_in_Hashemite_Iraq_1921_1958 The Elite, the Effendiyya, and the Growth of Nationalism and Pan-Arabism in Hashemite Iraq, 1921-1958 ]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, [[Charles Netter]], a founding member of ''Alliance israélite universelle'', received a tract of land from the [[Ottoman Empire]] as a gift and opened the  [[Mikveh Israel Settlement|Mikveh Israel]] agricultural school, the first of a network of Jewish schools in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] before the establishment of the [[State of Israel]]. Over 60 Alliance schools operated in the Ottoman Middle East, Iran and North Africa, providing Jewish children from poor families with formal elementary school and vocational training. Many of the teachers were educated at Alliance teacher training schools in Turkey and France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aT84Jn7zjU0C&amp;pg=PA158 The Jews of Islam, Bernard Lewis]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, Alliance Israelite Universelle was operating 100 schools with a combined student population of 26,000. Its greatest efforts were concentrated in Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; French was the third most popular foreign language spoken in Palestine by 1914.  Many French speakers came from North Africa but the eleventh Zionist Congress insisted that Hebrew, a holy language should be adopted in preference to German.  The AIU agreed that it would be taught on their curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Israel: A History, (2008), p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools in Israel==

''Alliance israélite universelle'' continues to operate dozens of schools and educational programs in [[Israel]] today. Historic schools include  the Alliance High School in [[Tel Aviv]], ''Alliance israélite universelle'' High School in [[Haifa]], René Cassin High School and the Braunshweig Conservative High School in [[Jerusalem]]. The network also includes the School for the Deaf in Jerusalem, in which deaf students, Jews and Arabs, with various mental and physical disabilities study together. The Mikve Israel Youth Village operates a state high school, a state-religious high school specializing in life and natural sciences, environmental sciences, and biotechnology; and a French-Israeli high school established in 2007 as a joint initiative of the Israeli and French governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kiah.org.il/eng/about/history/Kol Israel Haverim history]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on Girls and Women ==
The Alliance Israelite Universelle (AIU) changed and shaped the roles and opportunities for women in North Africa. Prior to the establishment of the AIU, primarily girls from wealthy or rabbinical families received an education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/morocco-nineteenth-and-twentieth-centuries|title=Morocco: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy and skilled training provided an opportunity for upward social mobility, especially to Jewish girls of underprivileged backgrounds who could not attain an education previously. Curricula featured foundational mathematics, such as arithmetic, exposure to European subjects such as European geography and the French language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, girls also received vocational training in fields from needlework and sewing, to bookkeeping, secretarial work, laboratory assistance, and industrial chemistry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many North African women were also educated and trained AIU teachers in France, returning to their home countries to extend the mission of the AIU. Providing vocational training promoted the economic independence of Jewish women in the region.

Along with economic change, the AIU changed cultural norms for Jewish girls in the Maghreb as well. Primarily, the AIU lobbied to extend the typical marriage age from twelve to fifteen by 1948.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This changing role of women led to controversy regarding the secularization of Jewish society through western-style education.

== The AIU and Secularization ==
Prior to colonization, rabbis and religious figures provided education. The AIU, and more generally, French colonization, challenged this model. Education shifted from the hands of religious leaders to secular, European instructors. In Algeria, this shift resulted in a legal mandate: in 1845, a law required Jews of Algeria to be registered in a French school, and to only attend a religious school as a supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9txi3xuuENcC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=jewish+schools+after+french+colonization+maghreb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oGu0MoHqmf&amp;sig=H5EWm2_Z6oJKpw1liheNGK2s8GQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL3qSjzKPZAhWC3YMKHVs4BvwQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=jewish%20schools%20after%20french%20colonization%20maghreb&amp;f=false|title=The Jews of North Africa: From Dido to De Gaulle|last=Taieb-Carlen|first=Sarah|date=2010-02-23|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=9780761850441|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the AIU did teach both secular and religious subjects, such as Hebrew and Biblical History, religious leaders still questioned and bemoaned the secular shift the AIU promoted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similarly, the AIU attempted to secularize the experiences of Jews and the legal systems in North Africa. In 1913 in Morocco, the AIU attempted to appeal to the French protectorate government to try "indigenous [Jewish] inhabitants" in French courts instead of rabbinical tribunals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laskier|first=Michael M.|date=1983|title=Aspects of the Activities of the Alliance Israélite Universelle in the Jewish Communities of the Middle East and North Africa: 1860-1918|jstor=1396078|journal=Modern Judaism|volume=3|issue=2|pages=147–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Analysis ====
Prior to the AIU, religious systems intersected with cultural and political systems. The AIU sought to secularize not only education, but also the related institutions influenced by religion. Attempting to secularize many aspects of Jewish life, institutions, and cultural norms demonstrates the AIU's extension of the French colonial mission––the school system was not a Jewish educational system, but rather a French colonial system focused on the emancipation and westernization of Jews.

== Political Influence ==
Along with secularization, the AIU wielded much political power for the political assimilation of North African Jews into French society. AIU instructors were instrumental in the movement of naturalization for educated, Moroccan Jews.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=n4ztCQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=+++Michael+M.+Laskier,+%E2%80%9CNorth++African++Jewry++in++the++Twentieth+Century:+A+Sociopolitical++Analysis,%E2%80%9D+in+North+African+Jewry+in+the+Twentieth+Century:+The+Jews+of+Morocco,+Tunisia,+and+Algeria+(New+York:+New+York+University+Press,+1994),+23%E2%80%9354.&amp;ots=pt6ZJm6fYC&amp;sig=Svf0znbU3Ndw-Z2oX9k40HarWzo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=North African Jewry in the Twentieth Century: The Jews of Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria|last=Laskier|first=Michael M.|date=1997-06-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814752654|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These teachers met with French officials, convincing them to expand their Jewish allies by granting naturalization rights to French-educated, intellectual Jewry from Morocco. Only the most educated were considered the "liberated", and thus the most qualified to merit French citizenship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Analysis ====
These conditions represent the AIU's civilizing mission in action: in order to be accepted as French citizens, North Africans must have demonstrated the status of an assimilated Jew who has learned language, culture, and intellectual thought all from the French perspective. Although the AIU provided education and the promise of upward social mobility, these benefits were to be realized within a European context. The French AIU advocated of naturalization attempted to convince both North African Jews and French officials that granting citizenship would create "Jewish allies," suggesting that assimilating Jews through education would build more partners perpetuating the French colonial mission in North Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2053">The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers ([[STCW]]), requires that seafarers be provided with "familiarization training" and "'''basic safety training'''" which includes basic [[fire fighting]], elementary [[first aid]], personal [[survival techniques]], and personal safety and [[social responsibility]]. This training is intended to ensure that seafarers are aware of the hazards of working on a vessel and can respond appropriately in an emergency.

According to STCW, The STCW 95 Code requires that you take this 5-day course of instruction. This course has to be renewed every 5 years, or under certain conditions, you have to show that you have at least 1 year of service on board vessels of 200 grt or more within the last 5 years. The components generally includes a Fire Prevention and Fire Fighting (Basic Fire fighting) course of  2 days, a Personal Survival Techniques (PST) course of 1.5 days, a Personal Safety and Social Responsibility (PSSR) course of  half a day, and, First Aid / CPR (Basic First Aid) course of  1 day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edumaritime.net/stcw-courses/basic-safety-training-bst Basic Safety Training Components]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic Safety Training or BST is the starting point for persons seeking employment in the maritime industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.net/washington/fremont-maritime-services-seattle Maritime Employment Requirement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic Offshore Safety Induction and Emergency Training or BOSIET is designed for marine personnel intending to work on an offshore installation in the UK maritime sector and forms part of a Common Offshore Safety Induction process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9244">[[Image:Langdell.jpg|frame|Christopher C. Langdell]] '''Christopher Columbus Langdell''' (May 22, 1826 – July 6, 1906) was an [[United States|American]] [[jurist]] and legal academic who was Dean of [[Harvard Law School]] from 1870 to 1895. 

Dean Langdell's legacy lies in the educational and administrative reforms he made to [[Harvard Law School]], a task he was entrusted with by President [[Charles William Eliot|Charles Eliot]]. Before Langdell's tenure the study of law was a rather technical pursuit in which students were simply told what the law is. Langdell applied the principles of [[pragmatism]] to the teaching of law as a result of which students were compelled to use their own reasoning powers to understand how the law might apply in a given case. This [[Socratic method|dialectical process]] came to be called the [[Casebook method|case method]] and has been the primary method of pedagogy at American law schools ever since. The case method has since been adopted and improved upon by schools in other disciplines, such as business, public policy, and education. This innovation, coupled with Langdell's introduction of strictly meritocratic principles into the evaluation of candidates, has led him to be considered 'arguably the most influential teacher in the history of professional education in the United States'.&lt;ref&gt;''Christopher Langdell: The Case of an 'Abomination' in Teaching Practice'' by Bruce A. Kimball [http://www.nea.org/assets/img/PubThoughtAndAction/TAA_04Sum_03.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Life==

Christopher Langdell was born in the town of [[New Boston, New Hampshire]], of English and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] ancestry. He studied at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in 1845–48, at [[Harvard College]] in 1848–50 and at [[Harvard Law School]] in 1851–54. As a student, he served as one of the Harvard Law School's first librarians. From 1854 to 1870 he practiced law in [[New York City]], but was almost unknown when, in January 1870, he was appointed Dane Professor of Law at Harvard Law School by [[Charles W. Eliot]]. Soon after, he became [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the Law Faculty, succeeding [[Theophilus Parsons (professor)|Theophilus Parsons]], to whose ''[[Treatise on the Law of Contracts]]'' (1853) he had contributed as a student.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1870&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter L|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received the degree of [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] in 1875.

Langdell resigned the deanship in 1895, in 1900 became Dane Professor Emeritus, and on July 6, 1906 died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. In 1903 a chair in the law school was named in his honor and after his death the school's primary academic building, housing both the world's largest academic law library and classrooms, was named [[Langdell Hall]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Langdell made the Harvard Law School a success by remodeling its administration. 
In a private correspondence of April 13, 1915, [[Charles W. Eliot]] wrote: "the putting of Langdell in charge of the Law School was the best piece of work I did for Harvard University, except the reconstruction of the Medical school in [18]70 and [18]71, and the long fight for the development of the elective system."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Henry S. Pritchett, ''Correspondence of Charles W. Eliot'', Small Manuscript Collection, Harvard Law School Library. Cited by [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.1/kimball.html Kimball (1999)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709014609/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.1/kimball.html |date=2008-07-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on legal teaching==

Dean Langdell's greatest innovation was his introduction of the [[casebook method|case method]] of instruction.  {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
Until 1890, no other U.S. law school used this method, which is now standard. 
Moreover, the standard first-year curriculum at all American law schools — [[Contracts]], [[Property]], [[Torts]], [[Criminal Law]], and [[Civil Procedure]] — stands, mostly unchanged, from the curriculum Langdell instituted.

Langdell, who came from a relatively unknown family, was conscious of the fact that students from more privileged backgrounds often received higher grades in their coursework purely because of their family's wealth and social status.  Dean Langdell instituted the process of [[blind grading]], now common at U.S. law schools, so that students already known by professors or from esteemed families would have no advantage over others.

The '''class of perfection''' ({{lang-fr|classe de perfectionnement}}) is an advanced [[ballet]] class for the highest ranking [[ballerina]]s in a ballet company. In Russia, the traditional class of perfection has been replaced by the unified company class,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/01472526.2012.720960| issn = 0147-2526| volume = 35| issue = 3| pages = 408–413| last = Rizzo| first = Laura Katz| title = Vaganova's Vision and the Development of Neoclassical Russian Ballet Technique| journal = Dance Chronicle| accessdate = 2018-04-29| date = 2012-09-01| url = https://doi.org/10.1080/01472526.2012.720960}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term may still be used informally for the special classes taken by only the highest ranking dancers in a company.&lt;ref name=greskovic&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn = 978-0-87910-325-5| last = Greskovic| first = Robert| title = Ballet 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving the Ballet| date = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= Ekaterina Krysanova (prima ballerina) | date=July 30, 2013 | title=Dance class with the Bolshoi ballet | location=London | publisher=The Telegraph |archive-url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhqzAVMHKZk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The class of perfection at the [[Imperial Choreographic School]] was taught by [[Christian Johansson]], who had himself been a pupil of Danish balletmaster [[August Bournonville]]. After Johansson, the responsibility of teaching the class passed to his former student [[Nikolai Legat]]. Many of [[Russian ballet]]s legendary dancers were once pupils of Legat's class of perfection including [[Njinsky]], [[Mikhail Fokine]] and the most important ballerinas of the time. Ballet mistress [[Agrippina Vaganova]] had also been one of Legat's class of perfection students.&lt;ref name=newman&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn = 978-0-87910-995-0| last = Newman| first = Barbara| title = Grace Under Pressure: Passing Dance Through Time| date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basketball coaching''' is the act of directing and strategizing the behavior of a [[basketball]] team or individual basketball player. Basketball coaching typically encompasses the improvement of individual and team offensive and defensive skills, as well as overall physical conditioning. Coaches also have the responsibility to improve their team by player development, strategy, and in-game management. Coaches also teach and inspire their team to be their best.

Coaching is usually performed by a single person, often with the help of one or more assistants.

== Coaching tools ==
A sketch or a hyperdrive board is often used mid-game to describe plays and provide an overview of the strategy of the opposing team. Coaches strategize and scout opposing teams and find ways to defeat them as easily as possible. At the same time, they overlook their own personal team to start the best five players (only five players can be on floor at one time). Coaches, also, have to be aware of subs to put in throughout the game so they can be fresh.

College basketball coach [[John Wooden]] would spend two hours each morning with assistants planning out a day's practice minute-by-minute on three-by-five cards.  He kept each card year over year to adjust and improve.  He would train his players with "mental and emotional" conditioning by always making practice more intense than the game.  Players would run faster than what a game would require so that they could be prepared to dominate in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coyle|first1=Daniel|title=The Talent Code|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=9780553906493|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8061">'''Deculturalization''' is the process by which an ethnic group is forced to abandon its language, culture, and customs. It is the destruction of the culture of a dominated group and its replacement by the culture of the dominating group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branch|first1=André J|title=Deculturalization|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/diversityineducation/n190.xml|website=SAGE knowledge|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deculturalization is a slow process due to its extensive goal of fully replacing the subordinate ethnic group's culture, language, and customs. This term is often confused with [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] and [[acculturation]].

==Methods of Deculturalization==
* [[Geographical segregation]]
* Forbidding education to the dominated group
* Forceful replacing of language
* Superior culture's curriculum in schools
* Instructors are from the dominant group
* Avoiding the dominated group's culture in curriculum

==Deculturalization in the United States==
'''African Americans'''
The enslavement of African Americans during the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States is a form of deculturalization. [[Slavery in the United States]] made the African Americans dependent on their owners allowing for the owners to exploit them. The owners removed their African names, did not allow them to read, and did not allow them to practice their culture and language. Deculturalization of African Americans stems back to When the African American slaves were forbidden access to education due to fear of a slave revolt against the slaveholders.&lt;ref&gt;http://h637-books.wikispaces.com/Deculturalization+and+the+Struggle+for+Equality&lt;/ref&gt; A series of court cases occurred in the United States helping deculturalization of African Americans as wells as there were cases that went against deculturalization. For example, the addition of the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] decision, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], [[Plessy v. Ferguson]], and countless others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/ukhxfexpakmq/deculturalization-of-education/|title=Deculturalization of Education|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Civil War (United States)]] segregated education continued and was a struggle to integrate fully and completely. While integration was achieved, the textbooks that the African American students learn from are bias and contain material from the dominant, Anglo-American culture.

'''Latin Americans'''
The deculturalization of Latinos can refer back to the Mexican–American War and [[The Treaty Of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. Once the United States won California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Wyoming and Colorado Mexicans who were living in these areas were removed from their lands. Their identity in the United States changed constantly from Mexican to White and vice versa until the word Hispanic was created to refer to these Mexican Americans. By simply using the word Hispanic to refer to the Mexican Americans and later the Latin-American immigrants refers to the conqueror's culture-the Spanish culture. Latin@ in the United States also had segregated schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/latino/latinothemestudy/education.htm|title=Demanding their Rights: The Latino Struggle for Educational Access and Equity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools they were given second-hand material from the wealthy, Anglo schools. When Latinos were being integrated, they as well as the African Americans, were being taught from bias, Anglo-cultured, Anglo-praising textbooks. Latinos did have a win to have bilingual education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilrights.org/resources/civilrights101/desegregation.html|title=School Desegregation and Equal Educational Opportunity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they were allowed to have bilinugal education, the primary, enforced language is the English one. In some schools Latinos were corporally punished for speaking Spanish in the classroom. In some Universities, Latinos were also forced to take many speech classes in order to remove the accents of the Latinos when they spoke English.&lt;ref&gt;http://wolfweb.unr.edu/homepage/calabj/282/how%20to%20tame%20wild%20tongue.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While that is not seen evidently in schools anymore, the education system continues to enforce English, Anglo-American customs, culture and language as the dominant one.

'''Asian Americans'''
Asian Americans began to be deculturalized by not being allowed to be naturalized, the Chinese-Exclusion Act, Japanese Internment, forbidding land ownership, and enforcing the Anglo-culture onto them. The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] did not allow for the Chinese along with other Asians to become naturalized, because the naturalization process was limited only to the Anglo community in the United States.&lt;ref name="ecaasu.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecaasu.org/site/important-dates-in-asian-american-history/|title=Important Dates in Asian American History - East Coast Asian American Student Union|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of schooling, in some cases Asian Americans were denied an education entirely. It was not until the 1900s when Asian Americans were allowed to receive an education through the implementation of certain provisions. In 1855, the Chan Yong case fortified that the Chinese are not "white" therefore ineligible for citizenship due to the Naturalization Act of 1790.&lt;ref&gt;http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/mit2005/Winter/History/RacismTimelin2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1922, the court case Ozawa v. United States, the Japanese man understood he was not allowed to be naturalized due to the former act, but asked for the Japanese to be considered white, but was denied the request.&lt;ref name="ecaasu.org"/&gt; The Ozawa v. United States shows how some Asians would rather refer to themselves as white than as Japanese or their individual ethnic group, because of the advantages that being "white" bring. The enforced Anglo-American culture upon the Asians and using them during the Cold War as a model minority that the United States is not racist, it is the individual's fault allows for deculturalization to be successful. [[Jade Snow Wong]] is a Chinese-American writer who was used by the American government to travel to the Asian world and show how an Asian can succeed in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1790878/_Americas_Chinese_Anti-Communism_Citizenship_and_Cultural_Diplomacy_During_the_Cold_War|title="America's Chinese": Anti-Communism, Citizenship, and Cultural Diplomacy During the Cold War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pre-Americans'''
Once the first settlement in Jamestown 1607 occurred, the Pre-American deculturalization process began. When the English came to America they looked to the Native Americans as "pagans" and "savages". Native Americans believed that the land was not property, a thing to be claimed and owned. Once the English settlers arrived this was one of the major culture difference that needed to be extinguished. The idea of private property and ownership was enforced upon the Native Americans. While even those who accepted it, because they understood the consequences, their lands were taken away. They wanted to impose the traditional "Christian" nuclear family as well among the Native Americans. In order to gain success the colonists made Native American Educational Programs. Christian missionaries such as John Eliot learned the Native American language in order to convert them into Christianity began the segregation among the "pagans" and the "holy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/11onrwncpstw/deculturalization-theory/|title=Deculturalization Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Native Americans were exploited. There was a cultural genocide and simply genocide against the Native Americans. From the Trail of Tears to the appropriation of their designs in order to gain capital, corporate gains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20788">'''Commuter couples''' are a subset of [[Two-body problem (career)|dual-career couples]] who [[Living apart together|live apart]] in separate residences while both partners pursue careers.&lt;ref name=Bunker1992&gt;Bunker, B. B., Zubek, J. M., Vanderslice, V. J., &amp; Rice, R. W. (1992). Quality of life in dual-career families: Commuting versus single-residence couples. Journal of Marriage and the Family, 399-407.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert and Rachlin address the difference between dual-earner families and dual-[[career]] families, distinguishing that dual-earner couples are those in which both spouses are earning for the family, but one or both of them consider their occupational involvement as a job. Jobs are unlike careers in that they do not require extensive training or commitment. In dual-earner couples, one spouse's work is generally considered secondary. Dual-career couples are families in which "both heads of household pursue careers and at the same time maintain a family life together".&lt;ref name="Rapoport"&gt;Rapoport, R., Rapoport, R. N., &amp; Bumstead, J. M. (Eds.). (1978). Working couples. New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; Both have high degrees of commitment to their careers, and neither partner's career is thought to be more important than that of the other.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, L. A., &amp; Rachlin, V. (1987). Mental health and psychological functioning of dual-career families. The Counseling Psychologist, 15(1), 7-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==

=== Statistics ===

In the United States, statistics from as early as 1989 report that 53% of married households were dual-earner couples. By 1996, the percent of dual-earner couples grew to 61%. According to data from 1989, approximately 7 million employees (15% to 20% of all dual-earner marriages) were classified as dual-career couples.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, C. M., &amp; Bruce, W. M. (1993). Dual-career couples in the public sector: A survey of personnel policies and practices. Public Personnel Management.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003, U.S. workers take more than 400 million long-distance business trips (i.e., trips over 50 miles) each year.&lt;ref&gt;the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Commuter marriages are on the rise, with recent estimates indicating that as many as 3 million Americans reside in different locations from their spouses.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, K. M., Kirby, E., &amp; McBride, M. C. (2007). "How do you get two houses cleaned?": Accomplishing family caregiving in commuter marriages. Journal of Family Communication, 7, 287-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation of commuter couples ===

The increase in women’s career opportunities also increases the problems of couples pursuing two careers in the same place, and can cause conflict regarding which spouse’s career should take precedence.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992&gt;Anderson, E. A. (1992). Decision-making style: Impact on satisfaction of the commuter couples' lifestyle. Journal of Family and Economic Issues, 13(1), 5-21.&lt;/ref&gt; One major concern for dual-career couples is finding employment in the same geographic location. One partner usually compromises by taking a less desirable job so that the other can take a position that might further his or her career. However, if this compromise cannot be reached, the option of commuting can be the result, where both spouses enjoy highly desirable jobs at the sacrifice of maintaining separate residences.&lt;ref name=Anderson1993&gt;Anderson, E. A., &amp; Spruill, J. W. (1993). "The dual-career commuter family: A lifestyle on the move". ''Marriage &amp; Family Review'', 19(1-2), 131-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of dual-career commuter couples, the work pursued by each member of the couple requires 1) a high degree of commitment and special training with increasing degrees of responsibility (this includes students pursuing an advanced educational degree) and 2) that the couple maintain homes in separate geographic locations. Traveling sales or business workers, [[military personnel]], [[migrant worker]]s, and construction and trade workers who leave home for various lengths of time are not included in the definition. When couples share a home and one or both members [[commuting|commute]] long distances to work each day or couples [[immigration|immigrating]] at separate times, they are also not included in this definition.&lt;ref name=Rapoport/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerstel1984&gt;Gerstel, N., &amp; Gross, H. E. (1984). Commuter marriages: A study of work and family. New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dyad of commuter couples is typically composed of the "commuter", who moves to a secondary residence for work, and the "noncommuter", who stays at the primary residence.&lt;ref name=Bunker1992/&gt; Other terms for the lifestyle are married-singles, commuter marriages, commuter families, commuter lifestyle, and commuter relationships.

=== Characteristics ===

Research reveals that most commuter couples have a high level of education and that both partners have [[professional]] or executive careers. Most are between the ages of 25 to 65, the mean age being mid- to late thirties.  Forty to 50% of commuter couples have children, and more than 50% have been married for more than 9 years.&lt;ref name=Anderson1993/&gt; Most of commuter couples are with advanced degrees and are heavily involved in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;van der Klis, M., &amp; Mulder, C. H. (2008). Beyond the trailing spouse: the commuter partnership as an alternative to family migration. Journal of Housing and the Built Environment, 23(1), 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The most attractive factor of a job for commuter couples is the job-education match.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, A. P., Brown, R. P., &amp; Patterson-Stewart, K. E. (2000). African Americans in Dual-Career Commuter Marriages: An Investigation of Their Experiences. The Family Journal, 8, 22-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===

Advantages of the commuting lifestyle are identified as 1) increased career opportunities, 2) professional autonomy, 3) increased independence, 4) increased appreciation of time together, 5) decreased focus on disagreements, and 6) decreased frequency of arguments.&lt;ref name=Groves1991&gt;Groves, M. M., &amp; Horm-Wingerd, D. M. (1991). Commuter marriages: Personal, family and career issues. Sociology and social research, 75(4), 212-217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Magnuson1999&gt;Magnuson, S., &amp; Norem, K. (1999). Challenges for higher education couples in commuter marriages: Insights for couples and counselors who work with them. The Family Journal, 7(2), 125-134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Winfield1985&gt;Winfield, F. E. (1985). Commuter marriage: Living together apart. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disadvantages ===

Disadvantages of being commuting couples are 1) financial problems; 2) [[loneliness]]; 3) lack of personal and professional support system due to a lack of time to build and maintain these relationships; 4) negative attitudes from friends, family, coworkers, and society; 5) increased tension in marriage and the family; 6) decreased satisfaction with sex life; 7) missed important family moments and day-to-day experiences; and 8) lack of social life, hobbies, and individual projects.&lt;ref name=Groves1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Magnuson1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Winfield1985/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson2000&gt;Jackson, A. P., Brown, R. P., &amp; Patterson-Stewart, K. E. (2000). African Americans in dual-career commuter marriages: An investigation of their experiences. The Family Journal, 8(1), 22-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing factors ==

=== Role conflict ===

There has been inconsistent evidence in relation to [[role conflict]] in dual-career commuter couples. Role conflict, according to Biddle, is “the concurrent appearance of two or more incompatible expectations for the behavior of a person”, and when a person experiences role conflict, it can have negative effects on multiple aspects of their lives, including decreased [[job performance]] and decreased [[organizational commitment|commitment to an organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Biddle, B. J. (1986). Recent development in role theory. Annual Review of Sociology, 67-92.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to that definition, findings have shown that many commuters find their lifestyle beneficial in that it allows them to pursue their careers without having to deal with daily family distractions, and also gives them a sense of autonomy. This ability to compartmentalize the roles the individual plays may lead to more work [[life satisfaction]], supported by findings that commuter couples generally had more work life satisfaction than dual-career couples in a single residence.&lt;ref name=Bunker1992/&gt; However, there are still challenges faced by commuter couples in their different roles. It would seem that such great compartmentalization can lead some individuals to struggle with balancing both their work and family roles and the responsibilities for each;&lt;ref name=Jackson2000/&gt; almost half of commuter couples studied by Anderson reported that they rarely felt that they had a good [[Work-family balance|balance between job and family]]. Also, families who are commuters are thought to become more competent in their performance of all family-related tasks, suggesting that there is a less traditional [[division of labor]] between the husband and wife.&lt;ref name=Anderson1993/&gt; However, Anderson and Spruill found that even in commuter couples, most traditional household tasks were still performed by women, while tasks such as household maintenance and lawn-mowing were performed by men.&lt;ref name=Anderson1993/&gt; These findings suggest that commuter couples may still be relatively traditional in their role divisions from a [[gender role|gender]] perspective.

=== Social comparison ===

According to Festinger (1954) and [[Social comparison theory|Social Comparison Theory]], when there is no “objective” assessment for one’s abilities or opinions, one will compare themselves to others who are seen to be similar.  It is also said that when others have a difference in abilities or opinions, one who is comparing themselves will almost always move their idea of what abilities or opinions are appropriate closer to the comparison others’.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1954). A theory of social comparison processes. Human relations, 7(2), 117-140.&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this theory, it makes sense that commuter couples would try to compare themselves to other married couples, but it will often pose problems for them because their relationships do differ in many ways. When commuter couples compare themselves to “traditional marriages”, it can cause them a lot of discomfort.&lt;ref name=Gross1980&gt;Gross, H. E. (1980). Dual-career couples who live apart: Two types. Journal of Marriage and the Family, 567-576.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true for society’s expectations of a commuter couple; if society compares them to “traditional couples”, they refrain from addressing important aspects of the relationship, and consequently lack a solid understanding. It was found that partners who felt that their peers thought that the commuting lifestyle was the beginning of a [[divorce]] experienced more [[stress (psychological)|stress]].&lt;ref name=Jackson2000/&gt;

=== Adjusting versus established couples ===

"Adjusting" couples are generally younger with few or no children, and they experience the separation earlier in their marriage. It seems that younger wives generally struggle more with the guilt that their husbands are disadvantaged in some way, and young husbands tend to feel a sense of loss in comparison to a traditional husband. These couples often experience more stress over the conflict of whose career is “more important” than the stress of being apart.

"Established" couples are generally older, have been married longer, and have children. With these couples, much of the stress comes from childcare. Generally, husbands will feel some resentment in the increase in responsibilities for the children, while the wives feel guilty about their lessened involvement in their children’s lives.&lt;ref name=Gross1980/&gt;

== Becoming a commuter couple ==

=== Attachment theory and perceived relationship quality ===

==== [[Attachment theory]] ====

In important romantic relationships, attachment refers to strong emotional bonding and the feeling of being secure.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, J. (1988). A secure base. New York: Basic.&lt;/ref&gt; To maintain the security feelings, individuals stay in a comfortable range of proximity to their partner.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969). Attachment and Loss: Vol. I: Attachment. New York, Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Under certain circumstances, even separation due to planned travel evokes concerns of the partner’s inaccessibility.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, J. (1973). Attachment and loss: Vol. II: Separation. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This inaccessibility may be associated with [[anxiety]], loneliness, and yearning for the partner. Through psychological (e.g., internal representation), symbolic (e.g., pictures), or physical proximity gaining accessibility, individuals calm down and restore security.	

Three different attachment styles are identified by attachment researchers:&lt;ref name=Mikulincer2007&gt;Mikulincer, M., &amp; Shaver, P. R. (2007). Attachment in adulthood: Structure, dynamics, and change. New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; secure, avoidant, and anxiety attached. Those who are securely attached have positive views of the self and their partner, and are confident when seeking proximity to the partner. Avoidant individuals, with two subtypes, generally suppress desires of seeking for partners. Specifically, dismissing-avoidant individuals have a positive self-worth, but have a negative view of the partner, and prefer low emotional involvement. Fearful-avoidants have negative views of both the self and the partner and fear rejection. In contrast, individuals with anxiety attachment styles are hyperactive, continuously seeking and attempting to maintain partner proximity. Those who have anxious attachment styles have negative self-views, and the partner is considered essential to self-worth but insufficiently accessible. The Relationship Questionnaire by Bartholomew and Horowitz (1991) &lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew, K., &amp; Horowitz, L. M. (1991). Attachment styles among young adults: A test of a four-category model. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61, 226–244.&lt;/ref&gt; and Experience in Close Relationship Scale by Brennan, Clark, and Shaver (1998) &lt;ref&gt;Brennan, K. A., Clark, C. L., &amp; Shaver, P. R. (1998). Self-report measurement of adult attach-
ment: An integrative overview. 

In J. A. Simpson &amp; W. S. Rholes (Eds.), Attachment theory and close relationships (pp. 46–76). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; are two commonly used measurements for attachment style. The Relationship Questionnaire assess attachment style by crossing the positive or negative view of self and partner. This questionnaire provides the categorical data, that means to categorize participants into four attachment styles without any scores. The Experience in Close Relationship Scale on the other hand, measures on a seven-point scale. People with lower scores are toward the attachment avoidance end, and people with higher scores are more likely to be attachment anxious style. This scale provides quantitative information about attachment style. Though the two scales can be used separately, they make up the categorical and interval part for each other. Thus, it is recommended to use both of them.&lt;ref name=Pistole2010&gt;Pistole, M. C., Roberts, A. &amp; Chapman, M. L. (2010). Attachment, relationship maintenance, and stress in long distance and geographically close romantic relationships. Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 27(4), 535-552.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of both scales have been proven valid in measuring attachment styles.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, K. N., Blatt, S. J., &amp; Shaver, P. R. (1998). Attachment styles and parental representations. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74(2), 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Perceived long-distance relationship quality ====

Secure attachment is related to positive relationship qualities (e.g., satisfaction; commitment).&lt;ref name=Mikulincer2007/&gt; Although it may seem counter-intuitive, [[long-distance relationships]] between securely attached individuals are perceived to be similar in relationship quality to relationships of securely attached individuals who are geographically close. Avoidant and anxious attachment style individuals who are involved in long-distance relationships perceive their relationship as lower quality than avoidant and anxious individuals in geographically close relationships. Commuter couples’ relationship quality are expected to differ based on the individuals’ attachment styles.&lt;ref name=Pistole2010/&gt; Recently, research found that commuter couples who meet on a monthly base (i.e., meet more than once a month) relationship quality was influenced by the separation.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Klis, M. &amp; Karsten, L. (2009). Commuting partners, dual residences and the meaning of home. Journal of Environmental Psychology, 29, 235-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Decision-making processes ====
Some studies report that many couples do not go through an evaluation of the commuting lifestyle before they engage in it.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerstel1984/&gt; Although the dual-career commuter couples are generally a highly educated and sophisticated group of people, the majority of the couples studied did not use a systematic [[decision-making]] process. The commuter couples did not collect information, talk to other commuting couples, or review other alternatives in making their decision to commute. Instead, the couples simply accepted that commuting was necessary and then discussed what the details of the impending separation would entail. In addition, two thirds of the couples made no plans to reevaluate the effectiveness of their decision to commute.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson1993/&gt; Despite these findings, there are couples who do go through a decision-making process. They are reported to have higher relationship satisfaction  than those who did not go through a systematic decision-making process.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992/&gt;

== Practical implications ==
For the individual, there are a few suggestions to be made in regards to becoming a dual-career couple based on implications of past research. First, the [[division of labor]] should be discussed and made clear to both spouses, so it each individual’s expectations are apparent. The stability of the relationship should also be considered, as well as the possible reactions each individual might have in response to societal views. The expenses of traveling and each spouse’s history of being alone (i.e., their attachment styles) should be considered as well.&lt;ref name=Magnuson1999/&gt; Finally, couples should consider discussing the decision with other commuter couples to gain first-hand knowledge.&lt;ref name=Anderson1993/&gt; 
Organization, frequent communication, and rituals have been found to be three of the most important aspects of successfully maintaining a commuting lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Rotter, J. C., Barnett, D. E., &amp; Fawcett, M. L. (1998). On the road again: Dual-career commuter relationships. The Family Journal, 6(1), 46-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Weekly organized meetings can provide an opportunity for the couple to practice communication, improve organization, take care of household responsibilities, and keep in touch about past and future events.&lt;ref&gt;Bettner, B. L., &amp; Lew, A. (1992). Raising kids who can: Using family meetings to nurture responsible, cooperative, caring, and happy children. New York: Harper Perennial.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerhart-Brooks, D. R., &amp; Lyle, R. R. (1999). The family meeting: Facilitating dialogue with divorced families. Journal of Family Psychotherapy, 10(2), 77-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a set of rituals and schedules can help commuter couples ease the stress of departing and reuniting with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S. E. (1987). Weaving the Threads: Equalizing Professional and Personal Demands Faced by Commuting Career Couples. Journal of the National Association of Women Deans, Administrators, and Counselors, 50(2), 3-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Rituals such as daily phone calls, sharing dinner while talking on the phone, regular dependable visitation times, a predictable routine for reuniting and departing, special dinner dates for their first nights together, and leaving intimate messages and signs of affection have been found to be helpful for many commuter couples.&lt;ref name=Magnuson1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson2000/&gt; These rituals help the couple establish a shared history that they can draw on during lonely moments.

'''Edna Louisa Beard''' (July 25, 1877 – September 18, 1928) was the first woman legislator in [[Vermont]]; she was the first woman elected to the [[Vermont House of Representatives]], and the first woman elected to the [[Vermont Senate]].&lt;ref name="vermont1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Edna Louisa Beard |url=http://womenshistory.vermont.gov/?TabId=61&amp;personID=40 |title=Person Detail |publisher=Womenshistory.vermont.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vermonttoday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vermonttoday.com/century/mostinflu/ebeard.html |title=Edna Beard |publisher=Vermonttoday.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A native of [[Illinois]], her parents were from [[Orange, Vermont]], and returned there in the early 1880s.  Beard was raised and educated in Orange, graduated from [[Spaulding High School (Barre, Vermont)|Spaulding High School]] in [[Barre (city), Vermont|Barre]], and became a school teacher and administrator.  She also served in local offices including town treasurer, and operated a dairy farm in partnership with one of her brothers.

In 1920, the Constitution's Nineteenth Amendment made it possible for women to vote in statewide and national elections.  Beard ran for the Republican nomination to represent Orange in the Vermont House of Representatives.  She lost, and subsequently filed to run as a third party candidate.  40 women in Orange registered to vote between the primary and general elections, and enough supported her to tip the scales for Beard, who won the seat and became Vermont's first woman state legislator.  She served one term, 1921 to 1923, and in 1922 was a successful candidate for the State Senate, becoming the first woman to serve in that body.  She left politics in 1924 because of ill health, but remained active on her farm and in her church.

Beard never married or had children.  She died in Orange, and was buried at Orange Center Cemetery.

Beard was born in [[Chenoa, Illinois]], the daughter of Royal Edson Beard (1845-1912) and Flora (Curtiss) Beard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 9, 1922 |title=Orange Sends Woman to Senate |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/355351612/ |work=The Bethel Courier |location=Bethel, VT |page=4 |subscription=yes |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |ref={{sfnRef|"Orange Sends Woman to Senate"}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her family was originally from [[Orange, Vermont]], and they moved back to Orange in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duffy|first1=John J.|last2=Hand|first2=Samuel B.|last3=Orth|first3=Ralph H.|title=The Vermont Encyclopedia|date=2003|publisher=University Press of New England|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTBCXqOou0YC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51 |ref={{sfnRef|''The Vermont Encyclopedia''}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated in Orange, and graduated from [[Barre (city), Vermont|Barre]]'s [[Spaulding High School (Barre, Vermont)|Spaulding High School]] in 1896.{{sfn|"Orange Sends Woman to Senate"|page=4}}

Beard received her qualification as a teacher, and taught at several local area schools.{{sfn|"Orange Sends Woman to Senate"|page=4}}  She was both a teacher and superintendent of the Orange town schools beginning in 1906.{{sfn|"Orange Sends Woman to Senate"|page=4}}  She also served on the school board, was the town's assistant postmaster, and spent 16 years as town treasurer (1912-1928), after having succeeded to the office following the death of her father, who was the incumbent.&lt;ref name="vermont1"/&gt;{{sfn|"Orange Sends Woman to Senate"|page=4}}  Beard never married or had children, and she resided on a dairy farm she operated in partnership with her brother Frank.{{sfn|"Orange Sends Woman to Senate"|page=4}}

==Political career==
===Vermont House===
In 1920, passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] enabled women to vote in state and federal elections in Vermont.&lt;ref name="vermont1"/&gt;  Beard ran for the [[Vermont House of Representatives]], and lost the Republican primary by six votes to Burt L. Richardson.&lt;ref name="vermont1"/&gt; Beard decided to run in the general election on the "Citizen's Party" line.&lt;ref name="vermont1"/&gt;  Between the primary and general elections, 40 women in Orange registered to vote for the first time; in November, Beard defeated Richardson by 38 votes, and became the first woman elected to the Vermont House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="vermont1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vpr.net/episode/33224/vermont-women-edna-beard/ |title=Vermont Women: Edna Beard |publisher=VPR |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was given the first choice of seats in the House, and, as reported by the ''[[Rutland Herald]]'', "She chose seat no 146, and for a long time no man had the courage to select seat no. 145, which adjoined hers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The seat stood vacant for over an hour until Horatio Luce of Pomfret took the dare of his fellow members and sat down beside Miss Beard amid a storm of laughter and applause."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Her first bill in the Vermont House of Representatives, Act 218, was signed into law.&lt;ref name="vermonttoday1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  It provided $2 a week child support for women whose husbands were "incapacitated by an incurable disease."&lt;ref name="vermonttoday1"/&gt;  Her [[maiden speech]] in the House was to second the renomination of Judge [[Stanley C. Wilson]] to the Vermont Superior Court, which contemporary news accounts indicated was received with "hearty applause."{{sfn|''The Vermont Encyclopedia''|page=4}}

===Vermont Senate===
In 1922 she was elected to Orange County's seat in the [[Vermont Senate]], and was the first woman to serve in that body.{{sfn|"Orange Sends Woman to Senate"|page=4}}  She served one term, 1923 to 1925 and held a leadership role as chairwoman of the Senate Library Committee.{{sfn|''The Vermont Encyclopedia''|page=4}}  Her first successful bill as Senator made it possible for county sheriffs to hire women as deputies.&lt;ref name="vermont1"/&gt;

==Later life==
She was urged by supporters to enter the race for [[Lieutenant Governor of Vermont|lieutenant governor]] in 1924, but left politics because she was in ill health.{{sfn|''The Vermont Encyclopedia''|page=4}}  She was active in her local Congregational church, including teaching Sunday school, singing in the choir, and serving as its clerk, and remained involved with the church until her death.{{sfn|''The Vermont Encyclopedia''|page=4}}

==Death and burial==
Beard died in Orange on September 18, 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 19, 1928 |title=Pioneer Woman Senator, Orange Official, Dies |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/197367354/ |work=[[Burlington Free Press]] |location=Burlington, VT |page=5 |subscription=yes |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was buried in the Beard family plot at Orange Center Cemetery in Orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 22, 1928 |title=Funeral of Miss Edna L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5784">'''Fredrik Stanton''' is an American author and filmmaker.

==Biography==
Stanton was a publisher for the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'' while at [[Columbia University]]. He has served as an election monitor in [[Armenia]], the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]], [[Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fredrikstanton.com/bio.html |title=Fredrik Stanton |first=|last=|publisher=FredriSstanton.com |year=2011|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===''Great Negotiations''===
{{main|Great Negotiations: Agreements that Changed the Modern World}}
Stanton's book ''Great Negotiations: Agreements that Changed the Modern World'' was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Great Negotiations: Agreements that Changed the Modern World |last=Stanton |first=Fredrik |year=2010 |publisher=Westholme Publishing |location=Yardley, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-1-59416-099-8 |page=|pages=|url=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 October 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The book was noted as unusual for focusing on negotiating content and the diplomatic process, rather than the direct major policy results or the diplomatic developments which resulted from the negotiations discussed therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2010/0103/book/book_mattox_negotiations.html |title=Great Negotiations: Agreements That Changed the Modern World |first=Henry |last=Mattox |work=unc.edu |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book presents the negotiations in a story-like format that "reads like fiction" in order to "appeal to both casual historians and those more conversant in international relations and foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogcritics.org/books/article/book-review-great-negotiations-agreements-that/ |title=Book Review: Great Negotiations: Agreements that Changed the Modern World by Fredrik Stanton - Blogcritics Books |first=|last=Emm|work=[[Blogcritics]] |year=2011|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been considered as a learning tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sebenius | first1 = J.

The '''Frost Entomological Museum''' is an active research institution, associated with the [[Pennsylvania State University]]'s flagship campus in [[University Park, PA]]. The museum houses a research collection, estimated at 2 million &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insect Holdings|url=http://ento.psu.edu/facilities/frost/holdings|website=The Frost Entomological Museum at Penn State|publisher=Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; arthropod specimens, and a public exhibition and educational space. Although the museum was founded in 1969, much of the collection dates to the early 1900s and even the late 1800s.
[[File:Frost museum pond with goose.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ten acre pond, near the museum]]
The research collection provides a record of the [[insect biodiversity]] of the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] and the eastern and southeastern United States. Major collection holdings include:
* [[Aphididae]] - The John O. Pepper aphid collection consists of over 32,000 mounted specimens, representing at least 800&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carl|first1=W.|title=John O. Pepper|journal=American Entomologist|date=1996|volume=42|issue=2|page=126|url=http://ae.oxfordjournals.org/content/ae/42/2/126.1.full.pdf}}
&lt;/ref&gt; species. The collection is especially strong in aphids from central Pennsylvania.
* [[Anoplura]] - The K. C. Kim collection of sucking lice comprises more than 15,000 slide-mounts and represents approximately 300 species.
* [[Odonata]] - The George H. and Alice F. Beatty Collection includes more than 60,000 dragonfly and damselfly specimens, collected from the 1940s through the 1970s. More than 1,000 species are represented, and half of the specimens were collected in Mexico.

Other notable collections, which reflect the interests of the museum’s namesake, Dr. [[Stuart W. Frost]], include [[leaf miner]]s, light-trapped insects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frost|first1=S.W.|title=Insects Taken in Light Traps at the Archbold Biological Station, Highlands County, Florida|journal=The Florida Entomologist|date=1964|volume=47|issue=2|pages=129–161|jstor=3493289|doi=10.2307/3493289|url=http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/56135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arthropods of the [[Archbold Biological Station]].

'''FuseNet''' is an organization that unites, coordinates and sponsors European educational efforts in the field of [[nuclear fusion]] in order to increase, enhance, and broaden fusion training and education activities in [[Europe]].

== The FP7 Project ==
The FuseNet project exists of the establishment of a European Fusion Education Network (FuseNet) for education in fusion science and technology. The purpose of FuseNet is to coordinate and facilitate fusion education, to share best practices, to jointly develop educational tools, to organize educational events. The members of FuseNet have jointly established academic criteria for the award of European Fusion Doctorate and Master Certificates. These criteria are set to stimulate a high level of fusion education throughout Europe.

The FuseNet project started in October 2008 as a Coordination and Support Action under the [[seventh Framework Programme]], with financial support of the [[European Commission]]. The project consists of eleven focused work packages, with a total budget of 2 Million Euro. The project runs until October 1, 2013 and is bringing together a broad representation from the European fusion community with 36 participants from 18 countries, of which 22 Universities and 14 Euratom Associations.

The project consists of four groups of coordination actions: the establishment and running of the FuseNet network; development of individual learning opportunities and common educational goals; development of educational materials and hands-on experiments; and funding of joint educational activities.

== The Association ==
The FuseNet Association is an independent legal entity that was founded in December 2010 to form the sustainable continuation of the activities started by the equally named FuseNet project. The association provides a platform for the coordination of European fusion education activities, the initiation, development and implementation of new EU-wide actions, and for the exchange and dissemination of fusion education information. All European organizations that are active in the field of fusion education and research are welcome to join the association.
FuseNet is the umbrella organization and single voice for the training and education of the next generation fusion engineers and scientists. FuseNet is recognized as such by the European Commission.

'''[[Higher education]] in [[China]]''' centers on a system of 2,000 universities and colleges, with more than six million students.&lt;ref&gt;Fuzeng, Yu. [http://www.internationaleducationmedia.com/china/index.htm China: Universities Colleges and Schools.] International Education Media.&lt;/ref&gt; The system includes Bachelors, Masters and Doctoral degrees, as well as non-degree programs, and is also open to foreign students.

The [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]] (MOE) is the government authority for all matters pertaining to education and language. The MOE notes that higher education in China has played a significant part in economic growth, scientific progress and social development in the country "by bringing up large scale of advanced talents and experts for the construction of socialist modernization."&lt;ref name="Higher Education in China"&gt;Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China. [http://www.moe.edu.cn/english/higher_h.htm Higher Education in China.] Beijing, PRC.&lt;/ref&gt;

China is also a major destination for international students,&lt;ref name=USNEWS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/top-world-universities/articles/2013/10/08/explore-the-worlds-top-universities?page=2 |title=Explore the World's Top Universities |last=Sheehy |first=Kelsey |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=October 8, 2013 |quote=Asia is among the fastest growing destinations for international students, and foreign enrollment at universities in Indonesia and South Korea have more than doubled since 2005, the agency reports.

== History ==
{{See also|History of education in China}}

The traditional Chinese education system is based on [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalist]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideals. The teaching of [[Confucius]] has shaped the overall Chinese mindset for the past 2500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhang|first1=Dongmei|title=The situation of Chinese students in Germany: an intercultural perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, other outside forces have played a large role in the nation's educational development. The [[First Opium War]] of 1840, for example, opened China to the rest of the world. As a result, Chinese intellectuals discovered the numerous western advances in science and technology. This new information greatly impacted the higher education system and curriculum.

A number of institutions lay claim to being the first university in China. [[Peking University]] is the first formally established modern national university of China. It was founded as '''Imperial Capital University''' ({{zh|c=京師大學堂}}) in 1898 in [[Beijing]] as a replacement of the ancient '''[[Guozijian]]''' ({{zh|c=國子監}}), the national central institute of learning in China's traditional educational system. Meanwhile, [[Wuhan University]] also claimed that its predecessor '''Ziqiang Institute''' ({{lang|zh-hant|自強學堂}}) was the first modern higher education institution in China. On November 29, 1893, [[Zhang Zhidong]] submitted his memorial to [[Guangxu Emperor]] to request for approval to set up an institution designed for training students specializing in foreign languages, mathematics, science and business. After Ziqiang was founded in [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]], not only courses in foreign languages was taught, courses in science (chemical and mining courses starting from 1896) and business (business course starting from the very beginning) were also developed at the school.&lt;ref name="自强学堂（简介）"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://edu.gmw.cn/2012-12/06/content_5931078.htm| title=自强学堂（简介）| accessdate=February 12, 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403173448/http://edu.gmw.cn/2012-12/06/content_5931078.htm| archivedate=April 3, 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, although the school officially changed its name to '''Foreign Languages Institute''' ({{lang|zh-hant|方言學堂}}) in 1902, the school still offered courses in science and business.&lt;ref name="自强学堂（简介）"/&gt;  In China, there had been some earlier schools specializing in foreign languages learning, such as '''Schools of Combined Learning''' in [[Beijing]] ({{lang|zh-hant|京師同文館}}, founded in 1862&lt;ref group=remark&gt;In 1902, School of Combined Learning in Beijing was merged with Imperial Capital University, now Peking University. However, Peking University never claims 1862 as its year founded. Neither does Peking University claim the year of establishing the [[Guozijian]], which can date back more than one thousand years. [[Hunan University]], with a similar history with Peking, often traced its history back to a school established in 976 A.D, thus giving this university a thousand years of history. See {{cite web |url=http://www.hnu.edu.cn/html/hudagaikuang/xuexiaojianjie/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307204933/http://www.hnu.edu.cn/html/hudagaikuang/xuexiaojianjie/ |archivedate=2015-03-07 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;), in [[Shanghai]] ({{lang|zh-hant|上海同文館/上海廣方言館}}, founded in 1863), and in [[Guangzhou]] ({{lang|zh-hant|廣州同文館}}), founded in 1864, but few provided courses in other fields, which hardly qualified as modern education institutions. Some argued that [[Wuhan University]] can only traced its history back to 1913, when the '''National Wuchang Higher Normal College''' ({{lang|zh-hant|國立武昌高等師範學校}}) was established, but [[Wuhan University]] officially recognized its establishment as in 1893, relying on the abundance of historical documentation and the experts' endorsement.&lt;ref name = "武大回应120年校史有史实依据 校庆活动不会改"&gt;{{cite web | author =  | title = 武大回应120年校史有史实依据 校庆活动不会改 | publisher = 武汉晚报 | date = 2012-12-07 | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/edu/2012-12/07/c_124061529.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1895, [[Sheng Xuanhuai]] ({{zh|c=盛宣懷}}) submitted a [[Official Communications of the Chinese Empire#Memorials|memorial]] to [[Guangxu Emperor]] to request for approval to set up a modern higher education institution in [[Tianjin]]. After approval on October 2, 1895, '''Peiyang Western Study School''' ({{zh|c=天津北洋西學學堂}}) was founded by him and American educator [[Charles Daniel Tenney]] ({{zh|c=丁家立}}) and later developed to '''Peiyang University''' ({{zh|c=北洋大學堂}}). In 1896, [[Sheng Xuanhuai]] ({{zh|c=盛宣懷}}) delivered his new memorials to [[Guangxu Emperor]] to make suggestion that two official modern higher education institutions should be established in [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]]. In the same year, he founded '''Nanyang Public School''' ({{zh|南洋公學}}) in [[Shanghai]] by an imperial edict issued by [[Guangxu Emperor]]. The institution initially included elementary school, secondary school, college, and a normal school. Later the institution changed its name to '''[[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Jiao Tong University]]''' (also known as '''Chiao Tung University''', {{zh|交通大學}}). In the 1930s, the university was well known in the world as the "Eastern [[MIT]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/History.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722053106/http://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/History.aspx |date=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/Pages.aspx?Index=10 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330133706/http://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/Pages.aspx?Index=10 |date=March 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qstheory.cn/kj/jy/201112/t20111212_129227.htm |title=践行钱学森教育思想 造就拔尖创新人才_教育视点_求是理论网 |publisher=Qstheory.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its reputation of nurturing top engineers and scientists. In the 1950s, part of this university was moved to [[Xi'an]], an ancient capital city in [[northwest China]], and was established as [[Xi'an Jiaotong University]]; the part of the university remaining in [[Shanghai]] was renamed [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]. These two universities have developed independently since then.
[[Tianjin University]] celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1995, followed by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Jiao Tong University]] (both in [[Shanghai]] and [[Xi'an]]) in 1996. Other leading universities, such as [[Zhejiang University]] (1897), [[Peking University]] (1898), [[Nanjing University]] (1902), [[Central China Normal University]] (1903), [[Fudan University]] (1905)，[[Tongji University]] (1907) and [[Tsinghua University]] (1911) also recently celebrated their hundredth anniversaries, one after another.

[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in the early 1950s brought all higher education under government leadership. Research was separated from teaching. The government also introduced a central plan for a nationally unified instruction system, i.e. texts, syllabi, etc. The impact of this shift can still be seen today. Chinese higher education continues its struggle with excessive departmentalisation, segmentation, and overspecialisation in particular.

From 1967 to 1976, China’s [[Cultural Revolution]] took another toll on higher education, which was devastated more than any other sector of the country.  The enrollment of postsecondary students can be used as example to illustrate the impacts. The number dropped from 674,400 to 47,800. This has had a major impact on education in the 21st century. The decline in educational quality was profound.

In 1977, Deng Xiaoping made the decision of resuming the [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination]] ([[Gao Kao]]), having profound impact on Chinese higher education in history.  From the 1980s on, Chinese higher education has undergone a series of reforms that have slowly brought improvement. The government found that schools lacked the flexibility and autonomy to provide education according to the needs of the society. Structural reform of higher education consists of five parts:
*reforms of education provision
*management
*investment
*recruitment and job-placement
*inner-institute management—the most difficult.&lt;ref name="Higher Education in China"/&gt;
The reforms aim to provide higher education institutions more autonomy and the ability to better meet the needs of students. Instead of micromanagement, the state aims to provide general planning.

The [[Provisional Regulations Concerning the Management of Institutions of Higher Learning]], promulgated by the State Council in 1986, led to a number of changes in administration and adjusted educational opportunity, direction and content. Reform allowed universities and colleges to:
* choose their own teaching plans and curricula
* to accept projects from or cooperate with other socialist establishments for scientific research and technical development in setting up "combines" involving teaching, scientific research, and production
* to suggest appointments and removals of vice presidents and other staff members;
* to take charge of the distribution of capital construction investment and funds allocated by the state
* to be responsible for the development of international exchanges by using their own funds.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Reforms picked up the pace in 2000, with the state aiming to complete the reform of 200 universities operating under China's ministries and start 15 university-based scientific technology parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationaleducationmedia.com/china/index.htm China to Accelerate Higher Education Reform.] People's Daily Online. 27 January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Present day==
In 2002, there were slightly over 2000 higher education institutions in PRC. Close to 1400 were regular higher education institutions ([[HEIs]]). A little more than 600 were higher education institutions for adults. Combined enrollment in 2002 was 11,256,800. Of this close to 40 percent were new recruits. Total graduate student enrollment was 501,000.&lt;ref name="Higher Education in China"/&gt; The number of graduates from Chinese higher educational institutions increased from 1 million per year in 2000 to 7 million per year in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Caron, Christina. “China and Canada: Economic Linkages, Migration, and the Canadian Labour Market.” ''Canada-China Human Capital Dialogue''. Conference held at Ottawa, November 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, there were about 4,000 Chinese institutions. Student enrollment increased to 15 million, with rapid growth that was expected to peak in 2008. However, the higher education system does not meet the needs of 85 percent of the college-age population.&lt;ref name="acenet.edu"&gt;Porter, Susan. [http://www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=11822&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm Higher Education in China: The Next Super Power is Coming of Age.] American Council on Education. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, 10 universities have been targeted by the Chinese government to become “world-class” — including Peking and Tsinghua universities. To achieve that goal, the government promised to increase the education allocation in the national budget by 1 percent a year for each of the five years following 1998. When CPC General secretary Chinese president Jiang Zemin attended the 100th anniversary ceremony at Peking University (Beida) in 1998 and the 90th anniversary ceremony at Tsinghua University in 2001, he emphasized this ambitious goal of advancing several of China's higher education institutions into the top tier of universities worldwide in the next several decades.

In the meantime, China has received education aid from UNESCO and many other international organizations and sources, including the World Bank, which loaned China $14.7 billion for educational development.

Since 2007, China has become the sixth largest country in hosting international students. The top ten countries with students studying in China include South Korea, Japan, USA, Vietnam, Thailand, Russia, India, Indonesia, France and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com.cn/edu/kong/news/2008/09-02/1367538.shtml |title=中国成第六大留学目的地 上年外国学生约20万名 |publisher=Chinanews.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaedunet.com/news/liuxue/2008/9/content_150885.shtml |title=中国成第六大留学目的地[图&amp;#93;—中国教育网_新闻资讯_出国留学 |publisher=Chinaedunet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111031929/http://www.chinaedunet.com/news/liuxue/2008/9/content_150885.shtml |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/edu/kong/news/2008/09-02/1367538.shtml |title=中国成第六大留学目的地 上年外国学生约20万名 |publisher=Chinanews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of international students studying in China often ranges around 200,000.

In spring 2007 China planned to conduct a national evaluation of its universities. The results of this evaluation would be used to support the next major planned policy initiative. The last substantial national evaluation of universities was in 1994. That evaluation resulted in the 'massification' of higher education with a renewed emphasis on elite institutions and education through initiatives like [[Project 985]] in the late 1990s and the [[Thousand Talents Program (China)|Thousand Talents Program]] which was launched in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conferenceboard.ca/e-library/abstract.aspx?did=7819|title=The Thousand Talents Program: Lessons From China About Faculty Recruitment and Retention|website=www.conferenceboard.ca|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} 
Since 2010, in some of the elite institutions, there has been an attempt at introducing some aspects of an American-style liberal arts curriculum for selected students.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Fischer, "[http://chronicle.com/article/Bucking-Cultural-Norms-Asia/130667/?sid=gn cultural norms, Asia tries liberal arts]" ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' February 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data from 2015 of the [[People's Republic of China Ministry of Education]], there were 2,845 Chinese National Higher Institutions, including 2,553 National General Colleges and Universities and 292 [[Adult Higher Institutions]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"2015 National College List" ''People's Republic of China Ministry of Education'' May 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The number of enrolled college students including undergraduate students, master and PhD students was 23.91 million in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;"2012 College Students statistics" ''People's Republic of China Ministry of Education'' May 01, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
From 2010 to 2015, the Chinese graduates continued to increase dramatically with almost 7.5 million new graduates entering the job market in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;"2015 Chinese College Graduates Employment Report" ''People's Republic of China Ministry of Education'' July 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 
Investment in education accounted for about 4% of total [[GDP]] in China in 2015.&lt;ref name="chinaeducenter.com"&gt;[http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/cedu.php "China Education" ''China Education Center Ltd'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government has been more concerned about education, particularly higher education, in the last decades.

International students have enrolled in over 775 higher education institutions in China.&lt;ref name="chinaeducenter.com"/&gt; Until 2014, there were more than 377,000 foreign students from 203 countries or regions study in China.&lt;ref&gt;"2014 Statistics of Foreign Students in China " ''People's Republic of China Ministry of Education'' March 08, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Although numbers of students have been increasing there are some serious concerns about the quality of education they are receiving and the skills they have at graduation. One study estimates that only 1.2 million of 15.7 million university graduates (or 7.6%) have skills that are valued by international markets for human capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/china/addressing-chinas-looming-talent-shortage|title=Addressing China's looming talent shortage|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the vast majority of students educated in Chinese universities do not have adequate skills to compete in anything but the most local Chinese industries.

==Admission process==
A student's score in the [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination]] (Gaokao) is the primary consideration used for admission into universities in China. Regional education development imbalance leads to the different treatment of students from different regions. Enrollment rules in China are based on the scores on the Gaokao, but a given university's minimum score threshold varies depending on the [[Provinces of China|province]] an applicant is from and the degree of competition in applicants from the province. The more you have more top universities in a region, the better chances its students will be enrolled into a top university.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The university admission quotes are not based on the area's population but the university’s enrollment plan. In some populous provinces, the competition is extremely fierce, while, in some areas with more institutions, such as [[Beijing]] or [[Shanghai]], access to a prestigious university is more attainable.

==Types of colleges and universities==
In China, according to ownership-based categories of HEIs, the higher education can be divided into two categories---State-owned or government-owned HEIs, including [[Regular HEIs]], [[Independent Institutions]], [[Higher Vocational Colleges]], [[Adult HEIs]], and non-government or [[private universities]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Zhu, HongZhen and Lou Shiyan|title=Development and Reform of Higher Education in China|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Limited |isbn=9781843346395|date=2011|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the long-time influence by [[Soviet Union]] and late development of [[private universities]], it has deeply rooted in Chinese heart that government-owned is much better than private ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Zhu, HongZhen and Lou Shiyan|title=Development and Reform of Higher Education in China|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Limited |isbn=9781843346395|date=2011|pages=1–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regular HEIs is the cornerstone in China’s higher education, while private universities development could not be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=2015 National College List|publisher=People's Republic of China Ministry of Education|date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the latest data(2015) of [[People's Republic of China Ministry of Education]], total number of Chinese National Higher Institutions  is 2845, including 2,553 National General Colleges and Universities and 292 Adult Higher Institutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Government-owned HEIs are likely to receive more policy and finance support from official level.

Compared with state-owned universities, private universities’ development is in an awkward position. Different with private universities in Western world, China’s private education is a complement to public universities to meet the needs for those who failed in their college entrance examination and who could not afford the tuition fees to study abroad. Due to the large population, [[Chinese public universities]] are impossible to satisfy everyone’s needs. Under this condition, private universities of China come into being. 
The advantages of their professional setting that more in line with market requirements could not make up for the lack of financial funds and students. Actually, these two factors are equal. The source of funds for them depends largely on students’ tuition fees &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Zhou, Guoping and Xie,Zuoyu|title=Bankruptcy Analysis of China’s Private Universities|journal=XiaMen University Press|date=12 May 2006|pages=46–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Except of competition from public universities and other [[sino-foreign cooperative private institution]], the most deadly weakness is that Chinese officials deny acknowledging their degree. In [[Private Education Promotion Law of the People’s Republic of China]], it clearly indicates that “Private university degree is that national recognition of the non national education series, belonging to private colleges awarded diplomas”.&lt;ref name="360doc.com"&gt;{{cite act |title=Private Education Promotion Law of the People’s Republic of China |type=Education Act |number=IV |language=Chinese |date=28 Dec 2002 ||articletype=Education |url=http://www.360doc.com/content/13/1205/13/7499155_334668953.shtml |accessdate=1 Sep 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though followed by “The educated in Private colleges enjoy the same level and rights in further education, employment, social welfare, and participation in advanced selection with the educated public schools” ,&lt;ref name="360doc.com"/&gt; it can hardly compensate the flaw that the degree belonging to only private colleges awarded diplomas, but no acknowledgement by officials.

===C9 League===
The [[C9 League]] (simplified Chinese: 九校联盟; traditional Chinese: 九校聯盟) is an official alliance of nine elite and prestigious universities in mainland China, initiated by the Chinese Central Government through Project 985 to promote the development and reputation of Higher education in China. Together they account for 3% of the country's researchers but receive 10% of national research expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=415193&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Eastern stars: Universities of China's C9 League excel in select fields}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[People's Daily]], an official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, refers to the C9 League as ''China's Ivy League.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.people.cn/203691/7822275.html |title=China's Ivy League: C9 League |access-date=17 Apr 2018 |website= People's Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This group of 9 elite universities includes [[Fudan University]], [[Harbin Institute of Technology]], [[Nanjing University]], [[Peking University]], [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]], [[Tsinghua University]], [[University of Science and Technology of China]], [[Xi'an Jiaotong University]], and [[Zhejiang University]].

Many other lists of elite Chinese universities exists. The C9 League dominates in terms of faculty recruitment, with disproportionate numbers of faculty who receive China's top two academic awards: the [[Changjiang Scholars Program|Changjiang (Yangtze River) Scholar award]] and the [[Thousand Talents Program (China)|Thousand Talents Professorship]].

==Challenges==

China exhibits a great need for better regulation as well as more academic qualifications, teaching experience, and understanding of social changes and technology. To achieve success, the state realizes that the impacts of the Cultural Revolution on education must be reversed. To this end, top universities now function as centers of excellence that serve as a model for all other institutes. A helpful model involved "twinning" of poorer institutes with model institutes to provide equipment, curricula, and faculty development.

There is also an issue of funding and equity. Although academic praise reforms for moving the higher education sector from a unified, centralized and closed system to one that allows openness and diversification, they understand that decentralization and semi-privatization has led to further inequity in educational opportunity. [[Graduate unemployment]] rates are also a growing concern.

There is growing concern about the mindset of students produced by Chinese institutions, where cheating is widespread and tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kreutzmann|first1=Rasmus|title=Up to 90% of Chinese Exchange Students Have Hired Essay Ghostwriters|url=https://jitterymonks.com/report-90-chinese-exchange-students-purchasing-essays-online/|website=The Jittery Monks|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many corporations feel the quality of [[Rote learning|rote memorization]] instilled in Chinese students serves as a detriment to creative thinking and the lack of real-world experience during the formative years negatively impacts students' ability to adapt to the global business environment easily. These issues will need to be addressed in the coming years if China aims to continue its drive for excellence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_GRSRPJS Wach Out, India: China is way behind India in the business of outsourced services, but it has now started to catch up.] The Economist. 4 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment rates are quite high among Chinese graduates. Because of expansion of universities in China last decades, more students had access to receive higher education. With continuous graduates’ entry into employment market, graduate unemployment is highlighted.  China’s recent upsurge in graduate unemployment has specific causes relating to economic development, education policy-making, and reforms in the economy as well as in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bai|first1=Liming|title=Graduate Unemployment: Dilemmas and Challenges in China's Move to Mass Higher Education|journal=Cambridge University Press on behalf of School of Oriental and African Studies |date=Mar 2006|pages=128–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International students==
With China’s rising national strength and popularity of Chinese in the world, China as a study destination attracts thousands of foreign students abroad and the number of foreign students continues to grow rapidly in recent years. According to 2014 data from Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China, there are more than 377,054 foreign students studies in all the 31 provinces in China, with an increase of 5.77% over the same period last year.&lt;ref name="moe.edu.cn"&gt;"2014 Statistics of Foreign Students in China " ''People's Republic of China Ministry of Education'' [http://www.moe.edu.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/s5987/201503/184959.html] March 08, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a record breaking 397,635 international students went to China, solidifying its position as the third most popular destination country for overseas students.&lt;ref&gt;"China's Rapid Rise As An Academic Destination" ''Student.com'' [https://www.student.com/articles/chinas-rapid-rise-academic-destination/] September 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; While US and the UK attracted nearly one-third of all globally mobile students, their leadership is under threat in the "Third Wave" of political turbulence and intense competition from English-medium Instruction or English-taught Programs in countries like China and Continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choudaha|first=Rahul|date=March 2017|title=Three waves of international student mobility (1999-2020)|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RmnCsexL7ZckFpR1FXVFFQZ2M/view|journal=Studies in Higher Education|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1080/03075079.2017.1293872|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest source of foreign students comes from Asia, accounting almost 60% of the total, followed by Europe 18%, Africa 11% respectively.&lt;ref name="moe.edu.cn"/&gt; For individual country, the top three countries of origins are South Korea (62,923), United States (24,203) and Thailand (21,296).&lt;ref name="moe.edu.cn"/&gt; Only 10% of foreign students receive Chinese Government Scholarship and the rest 90% are self-funded.&lt;ref name="moe.edu.cn"/&gt;

On the other side, more Chinese wealthy families are more likely to send their kids abroad to receive higher education. Free academic atmosphere, high-quality teaching quality and new way to cultivate talents---all these advantages contribute to the flood of Chinese students arriving in United States, United Kingdom, Germany and other developed countries. Chinese students have been the largest foreign group in USA since 2010, with 157,588 arriving between 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name="moe.edu.cn"/&gt; The same situation happened in United Kingdom and Germany. Western education will likely remain the leading choice for Chinese students due to its cross-disciplinary fields and development of critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;"90% Of China’s Super-Rich Want To Send Children Abroad" ''International Business Times'' [http://www.ibtimes.com/90-china%E2%80%99s-super-rich-want-send-children-abroad-434838] April 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

China has a strong demand for postsecondary education, to the extent that its university system currently cannot keep pace with demand. Consequently, universities in the United States, Europe and Australia play a significant role by partnering with Chinese universities, aggressively recruiting Chinese students for study in their host countries, increasing the number of students they send to study in China, and adding to their presence on the mainland, either through official foreign campuses or extensions. Australia, Hong Kong, and other Asian countries are already making strides into this market.

Partnering can be economically salubrious, either if the scholars choose to stay in the host country or return to the mainland. Most Chinese students who go abroad are among the best and brightest from their home country. Thus, if they choose to stay, they can benefit the economy of their host country when they gain employment and become members of their new communities. If they leave, they may maintain the contacts and connections they may have established, and also leave a positive impression on their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;Dynes, Robert.

==Funding==
Compared with [[commonwealth countries]]’ tuition, tuition of China’s higher education is relatively inexpensive. Nevertheless, the Chinese per capita income is much lower than western countries, so there are still some students from rural and mountainous areas facing funding problems. Chinese government has taken some measures to ensure the smooth enrollment of this group, like students loans, part-time jobs within campus, etc. It seldom has the news that some college students discontinue studies because of lacking of tuition or living cost.

Considering institution funding, it varies dramatically among different universities. In order to adapt to the fierce global competition in education, [[Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China]] initiated [[Project 211]] in 90s aiming at strengthening about 100 institutions of higher education and key disciplinary areas as a national priority for the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/cedu/ceduproject211.php "Project 211 and 985" ''China Education Center Ltd'']&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 4, 1998, President [[Jiang Zemin]] declared that “China must have a number of first-rate universities of international advanced lever”, so [[Project 985]] was launched.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The total number of [[Project 985]] is 39 and all of them belong to [[211 project]] at the same time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;   The initial aim is to promote China’s educational competitiveness and establishment of a number of leading disciplines in the world.

Meanwhile, it is also the beginning to widen the gap and cause the imbalanced distribution of scientific research funds between 211 project universities and common public universities. Within the project, it is not only a glory but also hints numerous tangible benefits. The majority of public universities’ development lies to all levels of government funds. Entry in this project means you will gain more research funds. According to another data from Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China, from 2009 to 2013, the total government research funding for 39 985-Project institutions is 13.9 billion RMB, with 73 211-Project Institutions approximately 5.1 billion RMB and  rest of 670 common undergraduate colleges only 7.9 billion RMB. .&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
  
The majority of Chinese universities are state-owned universities. The financial support from government level, in most circumstances, decides one university’s development. The imbalanced distribution of scientific research funds will deepen the gap among universities.

[[File:Hyperloop pod competition tube.jpg|thumb|Hyperloop pod competition]]
The '''Hyperloop Pod Competition''' is a competition sponsored by [[SpaceX]] in 2015–2018 where a number of student and non-student teams are participating to design—and for some, build—a [[scale model|subscale]] [[prototype]] transport vehicle to demonstrate technical feasibility of various aspects of&lt;!-- the test track tube is not an exact scale replica of the alpha-level Hyperloop ''en toto''; but it will have a number of characteristics to allow many aspects of that particular Hyperloop technology to be tested, as various teams vary their design approaches. --&gt; the [[Hyperloop]] concept.  The competitions have been open to participants globally, although all competitions and judging has occurred in the United States. 

For the 2017 competition, a Bloomberg journalist reported that entrants were required to hand over rights for SpaceX to use any of their technology in the future without compensation,&lt;ref name=bloomberg20180918&gt;
{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-18/in-elon-musk-s-hyperloop-contests-students-main-goal-is-scoring-a-job |title=In Elon Musk’s Hyperloop Contests, Students’ Main Goal Is Scoring a Job |last=McBride |first=Sarah |work=Bloomberg |date=18 September 2017 |access-date=22 December 2017 |quote=''Winners of last month’s contest received no prizes, and all entrants were required to hand over rights for SpaceX to use any of their technology in the future without compensation.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no requirement to this effect is found in the competition rules.&lt;ref name=sxcomp2rules20160831/&gt;&lt;ref name=sxcomp3rules20170905/&gt;

A fourth year of competition has been announced for summer 2019.&lt;ref name=sx20180215&gt;

== Overview ==
There were three judging phases in the 2015–2017 competition: a design competition that was held in January 2016, and two on-track competitions—27–29 January 2017,&lt;ref name=bi20170127/&gt;&lt;ref name=fitTest20161104/&gt; and, Competition Weekend II, 25–27 August 2017.&lt;ref name=geekwire20170827/&gt;  The on-track portion of the competition is run on the ''SpaceX Hyperloop test track''—or ''Hypertube''—a mile-long, partial-[[vacuum]], {{convert|72.0|in|m|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}}-diameter steel tube purpose-built in [[Hawthorne, California]] for the competition.&lt;ref name="uw20160108" /&gt;

30 of the 115 teams that submitted designs in January 2016 were selected to build hardware to compete on a sponsored Hyperloop test track in January 2017.&lt;ref name="verge20160130" /&gt;&lt;ref name="inverse20160203" /&gt;
There were more than 1,000 applicants at earlier stages of the competition.&lt;ref name="fortune20160131" /&gt;
The first competition completed in January 2017&lt;!-- with how many teams competing? --&gt;.  Delft Hyperloop from the [[Technical University of Delft]] won the first overall prize. [[WARR Hyperloop]], from the [[Technical University of Munich]] won top honors.  In April 2017, 24 teams were selected to compete in Competition Weekend II held in August; WARR Hyperloop won top honors with a {{convert|201|mph|km/h|order=flip}} top speed in the mile-long test track.&lt;ref name=geekwire20170827/&gt;

In August 2018, 18 teams competed in the main competition with top speed as the only judged criteria; two additional teams competed in the levitation sub-competition. WARR Hyperloop again won to honors in the main competition, beating its own record with a 467 km/h (290 mph) run; UCSB Hyperloop was the only team to be able to compete in the levitation sub-competition, thus automatically winning. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/28/17622770/spacex-hyperloop-pod-race-2018-elon-musk|title=SpaceX’s hyperloop race was all about ‘maximum speed’ (and celebrating Elon Musk)|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced during Competition III that Competition IV was confirmed to take place in summer 2019.

== History ==

The outline of the original [[Hyperloop]] concept was made public in August 2013 by the release of a preliminary—or alpha level—design document by [[Elon Musk]], with substantial design assistance from an informal group of engineers at both [[Tesla Motors]] and [[SpaceX]] who worked on the conceptual foundation and modelling of Hyperloop. The preliminary design called for a {{convert|90|-|132|in|m|sp=us|order=flip|sigfig=2|adj=mid|-diameter}} steel tube, operating in partial [[vacuum]] (nearly airless), utilizing pressurized vehicle "pods" to carry passengers or cargo that would ride on an air cushion driven by [[linear induction motor]]s and [[air compressor]]s.&lt;ref name="gm20130822" /&gt; The alpha design included a notional&lt;!-- the word here is "notional", not national; please do not change it to national --&gt; route running from the [[Los Angeles]] region to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], paralleling the [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] corridor for most of its length, so that preliminary economic analysis might be done on the concept.&lt;ref name="alphaSpacex201308" /&gt;
Responses to the design paper release included: "a flash of brilliance" and "hypercool"&lt;ref name="sjmn20130813Editorial"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mercury News Editorial |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_23854572/mercury-news-editorial-elon-musks-hyperloop-is-hypercool |title=Mercury News editorial: Elon Musk's Hyperloop is hypercool |work=San Jose Mercury News |date=13 August 2013 |accessdate=3 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to "nothing new here"&lt;ref name="gm20130822"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/hyperloop-musk-analysis/28672/ |title=Beyond the hype of Hyperloop: An analysis of Elon Musk's proposed transit system |last=Dodson|first=Brian |work=Gizmag.com |date=22 August 2013 |accessdate=3 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to "hype", "another science-fiction dream," and "completely impractical."&lt;ref name="sjmn20130813wolverton"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wolverton|first=Troy |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/troy-wolverton/ci_23856460/wolverton-elon-musks-hyperloop-hype-ignores-practical-problems |title=Wolverton: Elon Musk's Hyperloop hype ignores practical problems |work=San Jose Mercury News |date=13 August 2013 |accessdate=3 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days of the 2013 announcement, discussions concluded that building a successful Hyperloop subscale demonstration project could reduce the political impediments while improving cost estimates; Musk suggested that he could choose to become personally involved in building a demonstration prototype of the Hyperloop concept, including funding the development effort.&lt;ref name="gm20130813"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gizmag.com/musk-developing-hyperloop-demonstrator/28684/ |title=Musk announces plans to build Hyperloop demonstrator |work=Gizmag.com |date=13 August 2013 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist20130817"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21583588-elon-musk-electric-car-entrepreneur-and-proponent-private-colonies-mars |title=The Future of Transport: No loopy idea |newspaper=The Economist |volume=Print edition |date=17 August 2013 |accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 2015, SpaceX announced that they would sponsor a Hyperloop pod design competition, and would build a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[scale model|subscale]] test track near SpaceX's headquarters in [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]], California, for the competitive event. The competition could be held as early as June 2016.&lt;ref name="nbc20150615"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boyle|first1=Alan |title=Elon Musk's SpaceX Plans Hyperloop Pod Races at California HQ in 2016 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/elon-musks-spacex-plans-hyperloop-pod-races-california-hq-2016-n375386 |accessdate=15 June 2015 |agency=NBC |date=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spacex-competition201506"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/spacex_hyperloop_pod_competition.pdf |title=Spacex Hyperloop Pod Competition |publisher=SpaceX |date=June 2015 |accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
SpaceX stated in their announcement, "Neither SpaceX nor [[Elon Musk]] is affiliated with any Hyperloop companies. While we are not developing a commercial Hyperloop ourselves, we are interested in helping to accelerate development of a functional Hyperloop [[prototype]]."&lt;ref name="spacex-hyperloop201506"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hyperloop |url=http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop |website=SpaceX |publisher=Space Exploration Technologies |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More than 700 teams had submitted preliminary applications by July.&lt;ref name="binsider20150623"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thompson|first1=Cadie |title=More than 700 people have signed up to help Elon Musk build a Hyperloop prototype |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-hyperloop-pod-competition-has-more-than-700-applicants-2015-6 |date=23 June 2015 |accessdate=28 June 2015 |work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed competition rules were released for the first competition in August 2015, with revisions in October.&lt;ref name="rules20151020"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/2015_10_20_hyperloop_competition_rules.pdf |title=Hyperloop Competition Rules, v2.0 |publisher=SpaceX |date=20 October 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Rev 2.0 rules released in November; some editor replaced the Rev 1.0 release citation in the [[Hyperloop]] article a long time ago. --&gt;
Formal ''Intent to Compete'' submissions were due 15 September 2015 with SpaceX intending to release the detailed tube and technical specification by October 2015&lt;ref name="tamu201510" /&gt; but became available somewhat later.&lt;ref name="uw20160108"&gt;{{cite web|title=SpaceX Hyperloop Test-Track Specification |url=https://badgerloop.com/documents/TubeSpecs.pdf |edition=4.0 |publisher=SpaceX |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215070801/https://www.badgerloop.com/documents/TubeSpecs.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A preliminary design briefing was held in November 2015,&lt;ref name="gw20151215" /&gt; and {{asof|2015|10|lc=y}}, ''Final Design Packages'' were due on 13 January 2016. A ''Design Weekend'' was held at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] on 29–30 January 2016 for all invited entrants.  The selected pods will compete at the ''SpaceX Hyperloop Test Track'' in January 2017.&lt;ref name="tamu201510"&gt;{{cite web|title=SpaceX Design Weekend at Texas A&amp;M University |url=http://engineering.tamu.edu/hyperloop |website=Dwight Look College of Engineering, Texax A&amp;M |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University |accessdate=1 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912042548/http://engineering.tamu.edu/hyperloop |archivedate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 120 student engineering teams were selected from the preliminary design briefing presentations in November to submit final design packages in January 2016.  The designs were released to public view prior to the end of January 2016, and selected teams were invited to build hardware and compete in time trials, planned for mid-2016 at the time.&lt;ref name="gw20151215"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2015/124-teams-sign-up-for-spacex-founder-elon-musks-hyperloop-pod-race/ |title=More than 120 teams picked for SpaceX founder Elon Musk's Hyperloop contest |work=Geekwire.com |first=Alan |last=Boyle |date=15 December 2015 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SpaceX announced in January 2016 that they had engaged a [[Los Angeles]]-based, [[Fortune 500|Fortune-500]], [[Engineering Design and Construction|engineering design and construction]] firm [[AECOM]] to build the Hyperloop test track.&lt;ref name="verge20160126"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawkins|first=Andrew J. |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10834742/hyperloop-test-track-aecom-construction-firm-deal |title=Elon Musk's Hyperloop is getting a helping hand from serious construction experts |work=The Verge |date=26 January 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 29–30 January 2016 meeting at Texas A&amp;M University, hosted by the College of Engineering, the designs from the approximately 120 worldwide teams were reviewed and judged. 30&lt;!-- 22 in the verge20160130 source, plus 8 more in the inverse20160203 source a few days later, q.v. --&gt; teams were selected to go forward and build prototype Hyperloop pods for the competition later in the year.&lt;ref name="verge20160130"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawkins|first=Andrew J. |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/30/10877442/elon-musk-spacex-hyperloop-competition-awards |title=MIT wins SpaceX’s Hyperloop competition, and Elon Musk made a cameo |work=The Verge |date=30 January 2016 |accessdate=31 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inverse20160203"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Klein|first1=JoAnna |title=Eight New Teams Added to Hyperloop Competition This Summer |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/11020-e-new-teams-added-to-hyperloop-competition-this-summer |work=Inverse |date=3 February 2016 |accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2016, Musk announced that, due to the level of sophistication of the pod designs as well as design issues with economical design approaches to building the test track, "given this level of enthusiasm, there is no question we are going to have another Hyperloop competition."&lt;ref name="musk201601330"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab2VVp1GfmA  |title=Elon Musk speaks at the Hyperloop Pod Award Ceremony |people=Elon Musk |time=13:25–14:20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further information came in August 2016: the team sign-up deadline would be 30 September 2016 to compete in the second pod competition sometime in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://twitter.com/Hyperloop/status/771096110807080960 |title=Sign up for our second student Hyperloop competition by Sept 30 to race your pods in 2017 |publisher=SpaceX |via=Twitter |date=31 August 2016 |access-date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event, the mid-2016 competition schedule was delayed to January 2017.  [[TechCrunch]] published a photograph of the pod competition test track still under construction in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/02/heres-a-first-look-at-the-spacex-hyperloop-test-track/ |title=Here’s a first look at the SpaceX Hyperloop test track |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=2 September 2016 |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Competition teams visited the track for fit checks and vacuum/track tests during the first week of November, and a video was released.&lt;ref name=fitTest20161104&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://twitter.com/Hyperloop/status/794591020843339778 |title=This week student Hyperloop teams visited @SpaceX for vacuum/track tests.

The on-track portion of the competition finally got underway on 27 January 2017.&lt;ref name=bi20170127/&gt;&lt;!-- with how many teams competing? --&gt;.  [[WARR Hyperloop]], from the [[Technical University of Munich]] won top honors.

In April 2017, 24 teams were selected to compete in ''Competition Weekend II.'' Held in August 2017, WARR Hyperloop won top honors once again, this time with a {{convert|201|mph|km/h|order=flip}} top speed in the mile-long test track.&lt;ref name=geekwire20170827/&gt;

In September 2017, SpaceX announced that they would sponsor another competition in the third quarter of 2018.&lt;ref name=sxhyperloop20170910&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop |title=SpaceX Hyperloop website |date=10 September 2017 |publisher=SpaceX |access-date=11 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910053512/http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop |archivedate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As with the ''Competition Weekend II'' in 2017, only student teams may enter the competition, and the "competition will be judged solely on one criteria: maximum speed with successful deceleration (i.e. without crashing)."&lt;ref name=sxhloop2018rules-20170905/&gt;  Unlike the two test track competitions in 2017 however, all pods must be self-propelled. SpaceX will not provide an external pusher-vehicle as they did provide to facilitate student team pod testing in both the January and August 2017 competitions.  Ultra-small pods will not be allowed this time, with minimum pod length set at {{convert|5|ft|m|order=flip}}. There will be an additional sub-competition with up to three qualifying teams allowed to take part in a ''Levitation Sub-Competition'' that will require non-wheeled pod [[levitation]] and will be tested on an external (non-vacuum) test track. The pods will need to translate at least {{convert|75|feet}} down the track, stop, reverse, and translate back to the original position, all while levitating the entire duration. Fastest full cycle wins the levitation sub-competition.&lt;ref name=sxhloop2018rules-20170905&gt;

== Technical overview ==

Each competition has taken place on a {{convert|1|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us|sigfig=2|order=flip|adj=mid|-diameter}} test track built in southern California.&lt;ref name="nbc20150615" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge20160126" /&gt;
Test pods may not carry any human or animal, and are to be used solely to develop new technologies and subsystems for effecting higher-velocity tube transport systems.&lt;ref name="wsj20151130"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chee|first=Alexander |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-race-to-create-elon-musks-hyperloop-heats-up-1448899356 |title=The Race to Create Elon Musk’s Hyperloop Heats Up |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=30 November 2015 |accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The track will facilitate pod test runs where each pod is [[accelerate]]d, achieves a top measured speed that is reported in real-time, and then [[Acceleration|decelerate]]s by [[braking]], ostensibly before the end of the test track.  There will be a [[Runaway truck ramp|crash pit]] after the end of the track to absorb the [[kinetic energy|energy]] of any test pods that fail to come to a stop in the test track tube.&lt;ref name="fortune20160131"&gt;{{cite news |last=Morris|first=David Z. |url=http://fortune.com/2016/01/31/mit-wins-hyperloop-competition-and-elon-musk-drops-in/ |title=MIT Wins Hyperloop Competition, And Elon Musk Drops In |work=Fortune |date=31 January 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="musk201601330" /&gt;

=== Test track ===

The '''SpaceX Hyperloop test track'''&lt;!-- Bolded per [[WP:MOS]]/[[WP:MOSBOLD]] since this term is redirected to here. --&gt; — or ''Hypertube''&lt;ref name="uw20160108" /&gt; — was designed in 2015 and was constructed in 2016, reaching its full length of one mile by October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2016/10/06/spacex-hyperloop-test-track-is-up-hawthorne/ |title=SpaceX’s 1-mile Hyperloop test track is now up along its HQ and Tesla’s Design Studio |first=Fred |last=Lambert |work=Electrek |date=6 October 2016 |accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test track itself is also a prototype, where SpaceX anticipates learning from the design, build process and evaluates how to apply automated construction techniques to future Hyperloop tracks.&lt;ref name="musk201601330" /&gt;

[[File:HPC Hypertube Rev4- 20160108-withEnLabels.png|thumb|Cross section of the ''Hypertube'' test track used in the Hyperloop pod competitions.]]

The design of the pod test track varies significantly from the Hyperloop tube design shown in the initial alpha-level Hyperloop design concept document released in 2013.&lt;ref name="alphaSpacex201308"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/hyperloop_alpha-20130812.pdf |title=Hyperloop Alpha |first=Elon|last=Musk |work=SpaceX |date=12 August 2013 |accessdate=2 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hypertube test track is designed to enable competitors who implement a wide array of designs and build pods that will test a variety of [[subsystem|subsystem technologies]] that are important to new vehicle transport systems.  This will include [[Hyperloop]]-specific pods—with air-bearing suspension and low-pressure compressor designs—as well as wheeled vehicle and magnetic levitation rail designs that will support a wide array of vehicle technologies to be tested.  Some pods are expected to test only particular subsystems rather than a full Hyperloop-capable pod vehicle design; as well, many pods will have no on-pod compressor to prevent the high-speed [[Kantrowitz limit|choked-flow]] problem, very unlike the Hyperloop alpha design.&lt;ref name="uw20160108" /&gt;

Multiple systems will be allowed for [[propulsion]] and for [[levitation]]/[[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] of various team pods.  Three explicit suspension types are called out: [[wheel]]s, [[air bearing]]s, and [[magnetic levitation]]. [[Vehicle propulsion|Pod propulsion]] may be ''On-pod''—as envisioned in the alpha Hyperloop design—or for the Hypertube test track, may use a SpaceX-provided ''Pusher'' to accelerate pods up to speed in the first 15 percent of track length, or even be unique (team-specific) ''Off-pod'' propulsion systems that would need to be integrated into the Hypertube for that Pod's specific test run.&lt;ref name="uw20160108" /&gt;

==== Specifications ====

The test track specifications {{asof|2016|01|lc=y}} include:&lt;ref name="uw20160108" /&gt;
* Outer diameter: {{convert|72.0|in|m|sp=us|order=flip}}&lt;ref name="uw20160108" /&gt; (vs. approximately {{convert|90|-|132|in|m|sp=us|order=flip|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} for the tube in the initial alpha Hyperloop design document&lt;!-- 7ft4in to 10ft10in inner diameters plus 2 x 0.8in to 1.0in wall thickness envisioned --&gt;)&lt;ref name="alphaSpacex201308" /&gt;
* Inner diameter: {{convert|70.6|in|m|sp=us|order=flip}}
* Wall thickness: {{convert|0.70|in|mm|sp=us|order=flip}}&lt;ref name="uw20160108" /&gt; (vs. {{convert|0.80|-|1.0|in|mm|sp=us|order=flip|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} for the tube in the initial alpha Hyperloop design)&lt;ref name="alphaSpacex201308" /&gt;
* Length: {{convert|1|mi|km|sp=us|order=flip}} (approximate)
* Materials
** Tube: [[ASTM]] [[1018 steel|A1018 Grade 36 carbon steel]]
** Rail: [[6061 aluminium alloy|Aluminum 6061-T6]]
** Subtrack: AA1370-50&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheettext.aspx?matid=8811 1370 Aluminum], MatWeb.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aluminum alloy]] for electrical applications
** {{convert|48.0|in|m|sp=us|order=flip|sigfig=2|abbr=on|adj=mid|-wide}} [[Concrete]] base inside the tube to support wheeled-vehicle pods
* Subtrack thickness: {{convert|1.0|in|mm|sp=us|order=flip}} for first and last {{convert|200|ft|m|sp=us|order=flip}}; {{convert|0.5|in|mm|sp=us|order=flip}} for remainder of tube
* Internal pressure: {{convert|0.02|-|14.7|psi|sigfig=2|lk=on|order=flip}}  (competitors may select tube operating pressure "in order to support various types of [[propulsion system]]s, [[Air compressor|compressor]]s (if applicable), and [[outer mold line]]s"
* [[Vacuum pump|Pumpdown]] time is expected to be as long as 30 minutes to reach the minimum pressure rating.
* Thermal control system: none provided in the Hypertube.  Tube temperature is expected to vary based on time of day and weather, and competitors will need to design their pods accordingly, mitigating [[Thermal management (electronics)|thermal hotspots]] during pumpdown and test runs.
* Braking system: the only Hypertube-provided braking is the emergency foam pit at the end of the mile-long tube.  Pods are expected to provide their own pod-specific [[braking system]], one that will [[Reaction (physics)|react]] force to the Hypertube by one of four methods: either against the steel tube, or concrete base, or aluminum subtrack, or central rail.  Tube requirements limit [[friction]] braking against the subtrack or rail to specified limits.
* Power: none provided on the test track during testing; 240[[AC voltage|V&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;]]/50[[Ampere|A]] and 120V&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;/15A power provided in the pod waiting area up through the pre-launch phase within the tube
* Communications:  SpaceX will provide a standard Network Access Panel (NAP) device (approximately {{convert|10|x|8|x|1.5|in|mm|sp=us|order=flip|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}) for mounting on each pod which will communicate to the in-tube [[802.11g|network]] via two, redundant, 1–25&amp;nbsp;GHz, [[blade antenna|wave blade antennas]].  The NAP will also record [[temperature]], [[acceleration]], [[vibration]] and [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]] of each pod in real time during each test run.
* Navigation aids:  The tube will include a series of circumferential [[Retroreflective sheeting|reflective stripes]] applied to the inner circumference of the tube, located on the top of the tube, to be used for [[Optical sensing|optical pod navigation]], and in particular, awareness of the last {{convert|1000|ft|m|sp=us|order=flip}} of the tube so pod braking may be safely effected.

=== Vehicle pods ===

Three variations of exterior design are currently being explored for vehicle pods. One pod design uses [[air bearings]]; this design relies on a system to create a bed of air for the pod to glide upon and is the basis of Elon Musk’s original Hyperloop idea.&lt;ref name="alphaSpacex201308" /&gt; Another pod design uses [[magnetic levitation]]; this design was used by the winner of the “Best Overall Design Award” [[Michigan Institute of Aviation and Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The third design uses high speed wheels for speeds under 100&amp;nbsp;mph and air bearings for higher speeds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This design was used by [[University of Colorado, Denver|University of Colorado, Denver's]] Hyperlynx team.

The inside design of the pods vary by team. Some of the teams are solely building pods designed for cargo transport. Other teams designed pods to transport passengers, while other designs would allow adjustments to be made to the pod to allow both, while MIT's team's initial design did not have room for a passenger or cargo and solely relied on the engineering of the pod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

=== Phase 1: Design weekend (January 2016) ===

Five design awards were assigned following the January design weekend.&lt;ref name="verge20160130" /&gt;

''MIT Hyperloop Team's'' design was awarded received the "Best Overall Design Award",&lt;ref name="verge20160130" /&gt; among the 23 designs selected to move to the prototype stage. The design proposes a 250&amp;nbsp;kg (551&amp;nbsp;lb) pod with a [[carbon fiber]] and [[polycarbonate]] sheet exterior. It is elevated by a passive [[magnetic levitation]] system comprising 20 [[neodymium]] magnets that will maintain a 15&amp;nbsp;mm (0.6&amp;nbsp;in) distance above the track.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = MIT engineers win Hyperloop pod competition, will test prototype in mid-2016|url = http://www.gizmag.com/mit-hyperloop-competition/41589|website = www.gizmag.com|access-date = 1 February 2016|date = 31 January 2016|first = Nick|last = Lavars}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The team says with air pressure at 140 [[Pascal (unit)|Pascals]], the pod could accelerate at 2.4 [[Gravity of Earth|G]] and have 2 [[Newton (unit)|Newton]] aerodynamic drag when traveling at 110&amp;nbsp;m/s. The design includes a [[fail-safe]] braking system that automatically halts the pod should the actuators or computers fail, and low speed emergency drive wheels that can move the pod 1&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Delft Hyperloop'' received a "Pod Innovation Award",&lt;ref name="verge20160130" /&gt;
while ''Badgerloop'', ''Hyperloop at Virginia Tech'', and ''HyperXite'' at [[University of California, Irvine|UC Irvine]] each received a "Pod Technical Excellence Award". One award for "Best Non-Student Team" was awarded to ''rLoop'', a team which formed on the SpaceX subreddit.&lt;ref name="verge20160130" /&gt;

In addition to the five pod awards above, nine subsystem awards and three "design only" awards were given to teams, most to teams that were not chosen to continue on to the on-track competition.
Technical awards for outstanding technical merit in subsystem and design, based on "innovation and uniqueness of subsystem design, full Hyperloop system applicability and economics; level of design detail; strength of supporting analysis and tests; and quality of documentation and presentation."

== Competition II (August 2017) ==

The SpaceX "Hyperloop Pod Competition II" was held on 25–27 August 2017.&lt;ref name=geekwire20170827&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.geekwire.com/2017/germanys-warr-team-wins-spacexs-hyperloop-ii-race-201-mph-pod-run/ |title=Germany’s WARR team wins SpaceX’s Hyperloop II race with 201-mph pod run |first=Alan |last=Boyle |work=GeekWire |location=US |date=27 August 2017 |access-date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The rules for Competition II were released in August 2016. Unlike Competition I — where multiple judging criteria were used and multiple classes of vehicles and vehicle subsystems were judged — Competition II was judged by a single criterion: "maximum speed with successful deceleration (i.e. without crashing)."&lt;ref name=sxcomp2rules20160831&gt;

While approximately 24 teams competed, only the top three were selected to make test runs in the mile-long ''Hypertube'' test track. ''WARR Hyperloop'' won the competition with a test run clocked at {{convert|201|mph|km/h|order=flip}}.  ''Paradigm Hyperloop'' won second and ''Swissloop'' placed third.&lt;ref name=geekwire20170827/&gt;

As of April 2017, 24 teams had been qualified to participate in the August 2017 competition.&lt;ref name=sxhyperloop20170417&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop|title=Hyperloop |date=17 April 2017 |publisher=SpaceX |access-date=17 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419102131/http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop |archivedate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear how many teams actually participated.

== Competition III (July 2018) ==

The rules for Competition III were released in September 2017. One substantial change from Competition II was that "All Pods must be self-propelled. SpaceX [would] not provide an external Pusher" as they had on offer for teams during the first two pod competitions.&lt;ref name=sxcomp3rules20170905&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/2018_hyperloop_competition_rules.pdf |title=2018 SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition : Rules and Requirements |version=1.0 |publisher=SpaceX |date=5 September 2017 |accessdate=19 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testing week ===
The competition began with the testing week prior to competition weekend where teams were required to pass a series of comprehensive safety tests in order to eligible for a run in the vacuum tube. 

Several teams encountered difficulties during the week, including fried circuit boards and overheated batteries. However, six teams passed the final "open-air run" and were eligible for the final competition.{{cn|date=July 2018}} 

Three teams (Delft Hyperloop, WARR Hyperloop, and EPFLoop) were ultimately the only{{why|since six in the previous sentence|date=July 2018}} final competitors.&lt;ref name=verge20180722&gt;

The final competition took place during the competition weekend on 22 July 2018. Each team demonstrated their respective pods while the "tube runs" took place for the final three competitors. Netherland's Delft Hyperloop was first to make an attempt with a top speed of 88 mph before stalling in the tube. Switzerland's EPFLoop was second, yet complications{{clarify|date=July 2018}} led to a top speed of only 55 mph.{{cn|date=July 2018}} 

Germany's WARR Hyperloop were the defending champions, and beat their own record with a top speed of 290 mph during their run.&lt;ref name=verge20180722/&gt;{{cn|date=July 2018}} 

Three awards were later given out to WARR Hyperloop for their innovation in designing and building two pods; one for the main competition and the other for the levitation sub-competition. The other two awards went to the University of Washington Hyperloop team and Ireland's ÉirLoop.&lt;ref name=verge20180722/&gt;

The '''Independent Educational Consultants Association''' is a [[Professional association|professional organization]] for [[educational consultant]]s.

The Independent Educational Consultants Association is the international,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} professional organization representing school and college admission counselors working in private practice. The organization, founded in 1976, represents educational consultants who advise students and families on admission to private schools, colleges, summer programs, gap year opportunities or programs for teens who are acting out. Headquartered in [[Fairfax, Virginia]] in suburban [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]], IECA establishes Principles of Good Practice, holds training programs for those entering the field, hosts two international conferences each year, coordinates counselor tours of college and school campuses, publishes a variety of materials and serves as the public face of this fast-growing profession.

Membership in the Independent Educational Consultants Association demonstrates that one has met rigorous standards. Those seeking membership must have a minimum of three years of admission experience, hold a master's degree or higher, have visited and evaluated a minimum of 50 campuses, provide references from among both professional colleagues and parents, and have their marketing materials thoroughly reviewed by a panel of peers. The IECA is an extremely rigorous membership. Only 7% of those who inquire about membership are ultimately accepted, making membership akin to licensure in this unregulated profession. Only the most qualified and experienced independent educational consultants in the United States are recognized with the designation as a "Professional Member" within the IECA. This designation demonstrates that the consultant is an expert in their specific domain and holds advanced degree/s in multiple disciplines relating to education, psychology, special education, school law, school improvement, school leadership and/or college admissions.

The association has established the IECA Foundation, which seeks to support programs providing educational and college counseling to students and communities who could not normally afford such services. In the past decade the foundation has provided more than a half a million dollars in support to groups across the United States.

The association's executive director is Mark Sklarow, a known and respected educational leader who has served as executive director of [[Presidential Classroom]] and City at Peace, two not-for-profit educational organizations. Sklarow is a former school dean in [[Philadelphia]] where he taught high school social science and political science at the university level, and served as director of student councils in the City of Philadelphia and director of summer leadership programs in the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]].

The '''Initial Teaching Alphabet''' ('''I.T.A.''' or '''i.t.a.''') is a variant of the [[Latin alphabet]] developed by Sir [[James Pitman]] (the grandson of Sir [[Isaac Pitman]], inventor of a system of shorthand) in the early 1960s. It was not intended to be a strictly phonetic transcription of English sounds, or a spelling reform for English as such, but instead a practical simplified writing system which could be used to teach English-speaking children to read more easily than can be done with traditional [[orthography]]. After children had learned to read using I.T.A., they would then eventually move on to learn standard English spelling. Although it achieved a certain degree of popularity in the 1960s, it has fallen into disuse.

==Details==
The I.T.A. originally had 43 symbols, which was expanded to 44, then 45. Each symbol predominantly represented a single English sound (including [[affricate]]s and [[diphthong]]s), but there were complications due to the desire to avoid making the I.T.A. needlessly different from standard English spelling (which would make the transition from the I.T.A. to standard spelling more difficult), and in order to neutrally represent several English pronunciations or dialects. In particular, there was no separate I.T.A. symbol for the English unstressed [[schwa]] sound {{IPA|[ə]}}, and schwa was written with the same letters used to write full vowel sounds. There were also several different ways of writing unstressed {{IPA|[ɪ]}}/{{IPA|[i]}} and consonants palatalized to {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, {{IPA|[ʒ]}} by suffixes. Consonants written by double letters or "ck", "tch" etc. sequences in standard spelling were written with multiple symbols in I.T.A.

The I.T.A. symbol set includes joined letters ([[typographical ligature]]s) to replace the two-letter [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] "wh", "sh", and "ch" of conventional writing, and also ligatures for most of the [[long vowel]]s. There are two distinct ligatures for the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and [[unvoiced]] "th" sounds in English, and a special merged letter for "ng". There is a variant of the "r" to end syllables, which is silent in [[non-rhotic accents]] like [[Received Pronunciation]] but not in rhotic accents like [[General American]] and [[Scots English]] (this was the 44th symbol added to the I.T.A.).

There are two English sounds which each have more than one I.T.A. letter whose main function is to write them. So whether the sound {{IPA|[k]}} is written with the letters "c" or "k" in I.T.A. depends on the way the sound is written in standard English spelling, as also whether the sound {{IPA|[z]}} is written with the ordinary "z" letter or with a special backwards "z" letter (which replaces the "s" of standard spelling where it represents a voiced sound, and which visually resembles an angular form of the letter "s"). The backwards "z" occurs prominently in many plural forms of nouns and third-person singular present forms of verbs (including ''is'').

Each of the I.T.A. letters has a name, the pronunciation of which includes the sound that the character stands for. For example, the name of the backwards "z" letter is "zess".

A special [[typeface]] was created for the I.T.A., whose characters were all [[lower case]]. Where capital letters are used in standard spelling, the I.T.A. simply used larger versions of the same lower-case characters. The following chart shows the letters of the 44-character version of the I.T.A., with the main pronunciation of each letter indicated by symbols of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] beneath:

[[File:Initial Teaching Alphabet ITA chart.svg|frame|center|Basic ITA chart]]

Note that "d" is made more distinctively different from "b" than is usual in standard typefaces (which is possible since in the I.T.A. there is no "q").

Later a 45th symbol was added to accommodate accent variation, a form of [[diaphoneme|diaphonemic]] writing. In the original set, a "hook a" or "two-storey a" (a) was used for the vowel in "cat" ([[lexical set]] TRAP), and a "round a" or "one-storey a" (ɑ) for the sound in "father" (lexical set PALM). But lexical set BATH (words such as "rather", "dance", and "half") patterns with PALM in some accents including Received Pronunciation, but with TRAP in others including General American. So a new character, the "half-hook a", was devised, to avoid the necessity of producing separate instructional materials for speakers of different accents.

==Decline==
Any advantage of the I.T.A. in making it easier for children to learn to read English was often offset by some children not being able to effectively transfer their I.T.A.-reading skills to reading standard English orthography, and/or being generally confused by having to deal with two alphabets in their early years of reading. Certain alternative methods (such as associating sounds with colours, so that for example when the letter "c" writes a {{IPA|[k]}} sound it would be coloured with the same colour as the letter "k", but when "c" writes an {{IPA|[s]}} sound it could be coloured like "s", as in ''[[Words in Colour]]'' and ''Colour Story Reading''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=J. K Jones|date=1967|title=Colour Story Reading|location=London|publisher=Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;) were found to have some of the advantages of the I.T.A. without most of the disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|author=J. K Jones|date=1968|title=Comparing i.t.a. with Colour Story Reading|work=Educ Res|volume=10|page=226}}
{{Cite book|author=J. K Jones|date=1970|work=Reading: Problems and Perspectives|title=Interim results in the Colour Story reading experiment|others=J. C. Daniels (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the I.T.A. was not originally intended to dictate one particular approach to teaching reading, it was often identified with [[phonics]] methods, and after the 1960s, the pendulum of educational theory swung away from phonics.

The I.T.A. remains of interest in discussions about possible [[English language spelling reform|reforms of English spelling]]. There have been attempts to apply the I.T.A. using only characters which can be found on the [[typewriter]] keyboard&lt;ref&gt;For a proposal by [[Edward Rondthaler]], see ''The Visible Word'' by Herbert Spencer (second edition 1969, {{ISBN|0-8038-7733-1}}), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; or in the basic [[ASCII]] [[character set]], to avoid the use of special symbols.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6027">The '''Iraqi Jewish Archive''' is a collection of 2,700 books and tens of thousands of historical documents from [[Iraqi Jews|Iraq's Jewish community]] found by the [[United States Army]] in the basement of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s intelligence headquarters during the [[Iraq War|US invasion of Iraq in 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandi Fox|title=Who owns the Jewish treasures that were hidden in Saddam Hussein’s basement?|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/stolen-treasures-iraqi-jewish-community/|agency=PBS Newshour|date=29 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection includes a wide variety of books and rare documents, ranging from 500-year-old commentaries on the Talmud to personal letters sent during the 1950s. These materials were abandoned during [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]], when almost all Iraqi Jews made [[aliyah]] to [[Israel]] on the condition (imposed by the Iraqi government) that they leave their property behind. The Intelligence Agency of the Iraqi regime subsequently gathered these books and documents from [[synagogue]]s and Jewish community institutions, eventually storing them in the basement where they would be found by the US Army.

The archive has been in temporary US custody since 2003, and is scheduled to be transferred permanently to Iraq in 2018. This plan is controversial: some Middle-East scholars and Jewish organizations have opined that because the materials were abandoned under duress, and because almost no Jews live in Iraq today, the archive should instead be housed in Israel or the United States.

==Discovery and preservation==

The archive was found by the [[United States Army]] in 2003 in a flooded basement. It was rescued due to a book freezing process on special trucks. With the consent of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority|provisional Iraqi government]], the archive was transferred to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives of the United States]] in [[Washington, DC]]. At a cost of $3 million, the archive was [[Digitizing|digitized]] and is fully available online.&lt;ref name=Tenorio2016&gt;{{cite web|first=Rich|last=Tenorio|title=Who should keep Iraqi Jewry’s archives, saved from Saddam, now on tour in US?|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/who-should-keep-iraqi-jewrys-archives-saved-from-saddam-now-on-tour-in-us/|date=6 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The documents are written in [[Hebrew]], [[Arabic]], [[Judeo-Arabic]], and [[English language|English]]. Certain irreparably damaged kosher scrolls (such as [[Torah scroll]]s and scrolls containing the [[Book of Esther]]) were ritually buried in accordance with [[Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ritual Burial of Parchment Fragments|url=https://www.ija.archives.gov/project/burial|agency=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate over return to Iraq==

The US National Archives' custody of the Iraqi Jewish Archive is temporary, and the United States is contractually obligated to return the collection to Iraq. This has engendered some opposition on the grounds that the collection rightfully belongs to Iraqi Jews, almost none of whom currently reside in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Tenorio2016" /&gt; [[Harold Rhode]], a Middle East specialist formerly at the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] who was present when the collection was found, has suggested that it should be placed permanently in Israel.&lt;ref name="Tenorio2016" /&gt;

In February 2014 the [[United States Senate]] unanimously passed a resolution calling on President [[Barack Obama]] to reopen new negotiations over the agreement on the archive return to Iraq. In May of the same year, the governments of the United States and Iraq had reached an agreement that most of the items of the archive would remain in the United States until September 2018.&lt;ref name="Tenorio2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dolsten2018"&gt;{{cite web |first=Josefin |last=Dolsten |url=https://www.jta.org/2017/09/08/news-opinion/politics/despite-protests-state-department-says-it-will-return-trove-of-jewish-artifacts-to-iraq |title=Despite protests, State Department says it will return trove of Jewish artifacts to Iraq|date=Sep 8, 2017|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the [[State Department]] said it would not seek to further extend the agreement,&lt;ref name="Dolsten2018" /&gt; but in July of 2018 reversed course and announced that it would work with the Iraqi government to delay the return of the archive.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web|first=Josefin|last=Dolsten|url=https://www.jta.org/2018/07/19/top-headlines/state-department-says-working-extend-iraqi-jewish-archives-stay-us|title=State Department says it is working to extend Iraqi Jewish Archive’s stay in US|date=July 19, 2018|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he earned the Duke Bar Association Distinguished Teaching Award.&lt;ref name="DukeBio"/&gt;

The courses he teaches include "Intellectual Property", "The Constitution in Cyberspace", "Law and Literature", "Jurisprudence", and "[[Tort]]s".&lt;ref name="DukeBio"/&gt;

==Written works==
He is the author of ''Shamans, Software and Spleens: Law and Construction of the Information Society''&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James (1997), ''Shamans, Software and Spleens: Law and Construction of the Information Society'', [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a novel published under a [[Creative Commons]] license, ''The Shakespeare Chronicles''.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James (2007), ''The Shakespeare Chronicles'', [[Lulu (publisher)|Lulu Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work on intellectual property, ''The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind'' (2008), Boyle argues that the current system of copyright protections fails to fulfill the original intent of copyright: rewarding and encouraging creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.suffolk.edu/highlights/stuorgs/jhtl/book_reviews/2008_2009/Stronge.pdf |title=Review: The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind |accessdate=27 July 2009 |author=Aaron Stronge |date=13 May 2002 |publisher=[[Journal of High Technology Law]], [[Suffolk University Law School]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also published under a non-commercial [[CC BY-NC-SA]] [[Creative Commons license]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James (2008), [http://www.thepublicdomain.org/download/ ''The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind''], [[Yale University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle also contributes a column to the ''[[Financial Times]]'' New Technology Policy Forum.

In 2011, Boyle was one of five experts consulted for the ''[[Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth]]'', a comprehensive analysis of the [[United Kingdom]]'s intellectual property system that made suggestions for data-driven reform of the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepublicdomain.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Is-Copyright-Reform-Possible1.pdf "(When) Is Copyright Reform Possible?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7068">'''Jay David Bolter''' (born August 17, 1951) is the Wesley Chair of New Media and a [[professor]] in the [[School of Literature, Media, and Communication]] at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. His areas of study include the evolution of media, the use of technology in education, and the role of computers in the writing process. More recently, he has conducted research in the area of [[augmented reality]] and mixed media.  Bolter collaborates with researchers in the Augmented Environments Lab, co-directed with Blair MacIntyre, to create apps for entertainment, cultural heritage and education for smart phones and tablets.  This supports his theory regarding remediation where he discusses "all media functions as remediators and that remediation offers us a means of interpreting the work of earlier media as well" (Bolter &amp; Grusin, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;55).

==Biography==
Bolter received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[Greek language|Greek]] from [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], in the [[University of Toronto]], in 1973.  In 1977 and 1978 he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Classics]] and an [[master's degree|M.S.]] in [[Computer Science]], both from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]].

Bolter received prominent fellowships at [[Yale University]], [[Cornell University]], [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]], and with the American Council of Learned Societies.

From 1979 until 1991, Bolter held various faculty positions at the University of North Carolina. In 1991 he moved to the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], where he remains today.&lt;ref name="shortcv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lmc.gatech.edu/~bolter/shortcv.htm|work=Georgia Tech|title=Jay David Bolter: Short CV|accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storyspace==
Along with John B. Smith and [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]], Bolter co-created [[Storyspace]], a software program for creating, editing, and displaying [[hypertext fiction]]. It was developed to support hypertext fiction in particular, although it can also be used for organizing and writing fiction and non-fiction intended for print.&lt;ref name="shortcv" /&gt; Although always credited as a coauthor of Storyspace with Joyce and Bolter, Smith wanted to clarify in an interview that he wasn’t involved in the development of either TALETELLER (which was a precursor to Storyspace) or Storyspace — but that he made more of an intellectual contribution insofar as "there was a sort of cloud of ideas that we were all drawing on in the discussions we’d have in this research entity at UNC, Textlab" &lt;ref name=barnet-what&gt;{{Cite web| last = Barnet| first = Belinda| title = Machine Enhanced (Re)minding: the Development of Storyspace| work = DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly| accessdate = September 4, 2013| url = http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000128/000128.html#smith2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the notable hypertext fictions created in Storyspace include: [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]'s ''[[afternoon, a story]]'', [[Stuart Moulthrop]]'s ''[[Victory Garden (novel)|Victory Garden]]'' and [[Shelley Jackson]]'s ''[[Patchwork Girl (hypertext)|Patchwork Girl]]''.

Bolter has used [[Storyspace]] to revise several of his own books. More importantly, Storyspace provides facilities for writing and editing, which includes a map of the structure of the links, making it accessible for new users. Storyspace is currently being developed by Mark Bernstein of [[Eastgate Systems]].&lt;ref name=hayles-what&gt;{{Cite web| last = Hayles| first = N. Katherine| title = Electronic Literature: What is it?| work = The Electronic Literature Organization| accessdate = 2013-01-03| date = 2007-01-02| url = http://eliterature.org/pad/elp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
[[Brian Eno]] has referred to Bolter as "the new [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = [[Brian Eno]] | title = Brian Eno on Writing Space | journal = Artforum | pages = 12 | date = November 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolter states in ''Writing Space: Computers, Hypertext, and the Remediation of Print'' that "Hypertext in all its electronic forms — the World Wide Web as well as the many stand-alone systems — is the remediation of print".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolter|first=Jay|title=Writing Space: Computers, Hypertext, and the Remediation of Print|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-8058-2918-0|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay David Bolter and his writing partner, Richard Grusin, make the claim in their text ''Remediation: Understanding New Media, "'' At this point, all mediation is remediation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Remediation: Understanding New Media|author1=Bolter, Jay David  |author2=Grusin, Richard|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0262522793|location = |pages = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Job Corps''' is a program administered by the [[United States Department of Labor]] that offers free-of-charge education and [[vocational training]] to young men and women ages 16 to 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://recruiting.jobcorps.gov/en/about.aspx |title=What Is Job Corps? |publisher=Job Corps |date=September 25, 2009 |accessdate=January 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821204349/http://recruiting.jobcorps.gov/en/about.aspx |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission and purpose ==

Job Corps' mission is to help young people ages 16 through 24, improve the quality and satisfaction of their lives through vocational and academic training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jobcorps.gov/AboutJobCorps.aspx |title=About Job Corps |publisher=Jobcorps.gov |date=2013-03-20 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422210019/http://www.jobcorps.gov/AboutJobCorps.aspx |archivedate=2014-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==

The Job Corps was originally designed by a task force established by Labor Secretary Willard Wirtz reporting to his Manpower Administrator Sam Merrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-10-23|title=‘Monday Memo’ is still the CEO's very best friend!|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ban.30164|journal=Board &amp; Administrator for Administrators Only|volume=32|issue=3|pages=4–4|doi=10.1002/ban.30164|issn=1525-7878}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the youth unemployment rate was twice the non-youth employment rate and the purpose of the initiative was to create a program whereby Youth members of the program could spend 1/2 of their time improving national parks and forests and the other 1/2 of their time improving their basic education skills which were severely limiting their occupational accomplishments.  The Job Corps Task Force initially recommended that Job Corps programs be limited to Federal National Parks, National Forests, and other Fedral Lands.

By the Kennedy assassination in 1963, the Job Corps' operational plans, costs, and budgets had been well developed, including coordination with the U. S. Forest Service and the U. S. Park Service, and Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) executed among the agencies. Initiating legislation and budgetary authorizations were drafted and submitted by the Kennedy Administration which in turn were submitted and introduced in both houses of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=United States Department of Labor|first=|date=1963|title=Youth Unemployment Act of 1063|url=|journal=Introduced but never voted upon|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When President Johnson and his planning staff decided on the War on Poverty, most of the proposed programs would take more than a year to even start. However the Job Corps idea was well along in the planning stage and could be deployed rapidly, so the Labor Department Job Corps Task Force was appointed to the Task force for the War on Poverty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keppel|first=Francis|date=December 2063|title=Appointment of the Labor Department Job Task Force to the Task Force for the War on Poverty|url=|journal=Executive Order|location=Washington, DC|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Job Corps was slated to be the initial operational program. 

Job Corps was therefore initiated as the central program of the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson Administration's]] [[War on Poverty]], part of his domestic agenda known as the [[Great Society]]. [[Sargent Shriver]], the first Director of the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]], modeled the program on the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC). Established in the 1930s as an emergency relief program, the CCC provided room, board, and employment to thousands of unemployed young people. Though the CCC was discontinued after [[World War II]], Job Corps built on many of its methods and strategies.

The first National Director of the Job Corps program was Dr. S. Stephen Uslan, who was appointed by President Lyndon Johnson and reported directly to Sargent Shriver.  The current national director of the Office of Job Corps is Lenita Jacobs-Simmons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jobcorps.gov/aboutjobcorps/administrator.aspx |title=Job Corps Administrator |date=July 17, 2014 |accessdate=August 1, 2014 |publisher=Job Corps |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704234029/http://www.jobcorps.gov/AboutJobCorps/administrator.aspx |archivedate=July 4, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Job Corps program is currently authorized under Title I-C of the [[Workforce Investment Act of 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jobcorps.gov/AboutJobCorps/authority.aspx |title=Statutory Authority |date=January 27, 2009 |publisher=Job Corps |accessdate=January 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119013234/http://www.jobcorps.gov/AboutJobCorps/authority.aspx |archivedate=January 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in 1964 under the [[Economic Opportunity Act]], Job Corps has served more than 1.9 million young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.careersourcepinellas.com/pages/jobcorps |title=Job Corps |publisher=CareerSource Pinella |accessdate=May 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505021157/https://www.careersourcepinellas.com/pages/jobcorps |archivedate=May 5, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Job Corps serves approximately 60,000 youths annually at Job Corps Centers throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expectmore/summary/10002372.2007.html |title=Program Assessment: Job Corps |publisher=[[Office of Management and Budget]] |date=January 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205161212/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expectmore/summary/10002372.2007.html |archivedate=February 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Outreach and Admissions (OA)''': This is the stage at which students visit admissions counselors and gather information, as well as prepare for and leave for their Job Corps Centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jobcorps.gov/cdss/OA.aspx |title=How Job Corps Works: Outreach and Admissions |date=January 27, 2009 |publisher=Job Corps |accessdate=January 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109171742/http://www.jobcorps.gov/cdss/OA.aspx |archivedate=January 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transportation is provided to and from the centers by Job Corps.

'''Career Preparation Period (CPP)''': This stage focuses on the assimilation of the student into the center, academic testing, health screening, and instruction on resume building and job search skills.

== Evaluations ==

In Program Year 2012, approximately 75 percent of Job Corps’ graduates were placed. Slightly more than 60 percent joined the workforce or enlisted in the military, while 13.5 percent of Job Corps’ graduates enrolled in education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jobcorps.gov/Libraries/pdf/who_job_corps_serves.sflb |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420190426/http://jobcorps.gov/Libraries/pdf/who_job_corps_serves.sflb |archivedate=2014-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS This Morning reported in October 2014 that some Job Corps centers have been accused of falsifying job placements and student training, as well as ignoring violence and drug abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-government-job-corps-program-investigation-raises-questions-about-effectiveness/|title=Federal government Job Corps program investigation raises questions about effectiveness|date=22 October 2014|work=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the DOJ commissioned an evaluation of the program based on randomized assignment of eligible applicants to the program. Results showed impacts on employment, wages, and crime rates 4 years after enrollment, but modest impacts afterwards. Youths assigned to the control group could enroll in other programs, therefore the results are to be interpreted as the impact on enrolling in Job Corps relative to potential enrollment in other programs. &lt;ref&gt;[https://wdr.doleta.gov/research/FullText_Documents/National%20Job%20Corps%20Study%20and%20Longer%20Term%20Follow-Up%20Study%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf Scochet, Burghardt and McConnell, 2006, National Job Corps Study and Longer-Term FollowUp Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan Felipe Herrera''' (born December 27, 1948) is a poet, performer, writer, cartoonist, teacher, and activist. Herrera was the 51st [[United States Poet Laureate]] from 2015 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-juan-felipe-herrera-20180413-story.html|title= Former U.S. poet laureate Juan Felipe Herrera wants poetry to be joyous|date= April 13, 2018|work= Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herrera's experiences as the child of migrant farmers have strongly shaped his work, such as the children's book  ''[[Calling the Doves]]'', which won the [[Ezra Jack Keats#Death and legacy|Ezra Jack Keats Book Award]] in 1997. Community and art have always been part of what has driven Herrera, beginning in the mid-1970s, when he was director of the ''[[Centro Cultural de la Raza]]'', an occupied water tank in [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]] that had been converted into an arts space for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.free-times.com/arts/feature/former-u-s-poet-laureate-juan-felipe-herrera-brings-revolutionary/article_afa6b15c-3d0b-11e8-8f2e-37882a62f68e.html|title= Former U.S. Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera Brings Revolutionary Style to USC Open Book Series|date= April 11, 2018|work= Free Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herrera’s publications include fourteen collections of poetry, prose, short stories, young adult novels and picture books for children, with twenty-one books in total in the last decade. His 2007 volume ''187 Reasons Mexicanos Can't Cross the Border: Undocuments 1971-2007'' contains texts in both Spanish and English that examine the cultural hybridity that "revolve around questions of identity" on the U.S.-Mexico border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=John|title=Contemporary Hispanic Poets: Cultural Production in the Global, Digital Age|date=2015|publisher=Cambria Press|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=978-1-60497-894-0|page=148|url=http://www.cambriapress.com/cambriapress.cfm?template=4&amp;bid=623|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Herrera was awarded the 2008 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in Poetry for ''[[Half the World in Light]]''. In 2012, he was appointed California Poet Laureate by Gov. Jerry Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A totally Californian poet laureate|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/20/local/la-me-poet-laureate-20120521|accessdate=19 July 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=20 May 2012|first=Larry |last=Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Herrera was elected a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/juan-felipe-herrera&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/juan-felipe-herrera&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Herrera was appointed as the nation's first [[Chicana]] or [[Chicano]] poet laureate.&lt;ref&gt;http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/06/09/juan-felipe-herrera-named-nations-first-latino-poet-laureate/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/06/09/juan-felipe-herrera-named-nations-first-latino-poet-laureate/ appointed as the natio
 n's first Latino poet laureate&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2016, Herrera was awarded an honorary Doctorate from Oregon State University.

==Early life and education==
Son of farm workers María de la Luz Quintana and Felipe Emilio Herrera, Juan Felipe Herrera lived from crop to crop and from tractor to trailer to tents on the roads of the [[San Joaquín Valley]] and the [[Salinas Valley]].  Herrera graduated from San Diego High School in 1967 and received the Educational Opportunity Program scholarship to attend the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/1822&lt;/ref&gt; where he received his B.A. in Social Anthropology.  Later, he received his Masters in Social Anthropology from Stanford University, and his Masters in Fine Arts in Creative Writing from the University of Iowa. In 1990, he was a distinguished teaching fellow at the [[University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop]].  After serving as chair of the [[Chicano]] and [[Latin American Studies]] Department at [[California State University, Fresno]], in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curbstone.org/authdetail.cfm?AuthID=62&lt;/ref&gt; Herrera joined the Creative Writing Department at [[University of California, Riverside]], as the [[Tomás Rivera]] Endowed Chair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creativewriting.ucr.edu/people/herrera/&lt;/ref&gt;  He also became director of the Art and Barbara Culver Center for the Arts, a new multimedia space in downtown Riverside.  	

Herrera resides in Redlands, California with his partner Margarita Robles, a performance artist and poet.  He has five children.

==Influences==
Herrera's experience as a [[Farmworker|campesino]] has strongly influenced his works. Traveling from [[the San Joaquín Valley]] to San Diego's [[Logan Heights, San Diego|Logan Heights]], and San Francisco's [[Mission District]] has left him three distinct Californias from which he draws inspiration.  Growing up in the '60s and attending college in the '70s during [[the Chicano Movement]] and more experimental writing such as the [[Beat Poets]], writers like [[Luis Valdez]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] inspired Herrera.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/1822&lt;/ref&gt;  The great era of artistic experimentation has also inspired his writing style in which he challenges the borders between styles, forms, schools, and genres.

Herrera, a writer constantly crossing borders, often writes about social issues.  Ilan Stavans, a Mexican American essayist, has said, “the past three decades in Chicano literature and his name is Juan Felipe Herrera.  Aesthetically, he leaps over so many canons that he winds up on the outer limits of urban song.”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/1822&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[New York Times]]'' critic Stephen Burt praised Herrera as one of the first poets to successfully create “a new hybrid art, part oral, part written, part English, part something else:  an art grounded in ethnic identity, fueled by collective pride, yet irreducibly individual too.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/juan-felipe-herrera&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community arts ==
Juan Felipe has received grants to teach poetry, art and performance in several different settings, including community art galleries such as the ''[[Galería de la Raza]]'' in San Francisco, California, in 1983-85, develop community art and literature broadsides (1977–1978)  in San Diego, California, teach poetry in prisons (Soledad Correctional Facility, 1987–88). His current work focuses on working with community colleges and schools in the Riverside country and in [[Coachella Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-juan-felipe-herrera-20130707,0,3719389.story|title=California's poet laureate likes to turn the tables|first= Hector|last= Tobar|date=July 4, 2013|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being named California’s Poet Laureate by Governor Jerry Brown in 2012, Herrera created the i-Promise Joanna/Yo te Prometo Joanna Project, an anti-bullying poetry project.  Joanna was an elementary school girl who was bullied and killed in an afterschool fight. The first half asks students to send in poems about the effects of bullying.  The second half of the project is to take action in preventing bullying. He hopes to collect the poems and publish it as a book in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juanfelipepoet.com/projects/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224704/http://www.juanfelipepoet.com/projects/ |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The MFT-MBA is based on MBA core curriculum.  Unlike tests that are not aligned to anything but their own curriculum, the MFT-MBA emphasizes content validity.   In order to display [[normative|normativity]] and ensure a consensus of what best reflects core curriculum, the content is constructed using results of a national curriculum survey.  According to ETS, content experts from a diverse representation of higher education institutions (including Major Field Test users and nonusers) participate in this survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/mft/about/content/ |title=Test Content Overview |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basing the exam on core curriculum makes it a level playing field exam, giving it meaningful results and enabling it to measure reasoning ability.&lt;ref name="Honors Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.t10mba.com/admission |title=Membership Admission Requirements |publisher=T10 |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt;

The test contains 124 [[multiple-choice]] questions. There are approximately 32 [[management]] questions, 31 [[marketing]] questions, 33 [[finance]] questions, and 28 [[management accounting|managerial accounting]] questions.  Half of the questions require the strategic integration of two or more subject areas.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt;  In addition to factual knowledge, the test evaluates the student's abilities to interpret materials, understand relationships, and analyze and solve problems.&lt;ref name="Hays Post" /&gt; 

The Major Field Test for MBA can only be taken once.&lt;ref name="Study Guide" /&gt; The amount of time allotted for taking the test is three hours.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt; It is taken on a computer.  All exams are given at proctored facilities. Test takers are provided with scratch paper and pencils, but calculators are not permitted. All test questions present four answer options to choose from, only one of which is correct.&lt;ref name="Study Guide" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12922">'''Maria Varela''' (born January 1, 1940) was raised in several places across the country

==Work In The Southern Civil Rights Movement==

Varela was formed in her work as an organizer, educator, writer, and photographer by her experience as a SNCC staff member from 1963 to 1967, working first in Selma and then across the Black Belt South. Raised Catholic by her Mexican father and Irish mother, Varela first got involved in the Catholic social justice movement by joining the Young Christian Students (YCS) in high school and then again in college. After graduation, Varela was recruited in 1961 to serve as a college campus organizer for the YCS National Office. She traveled across the country, urging Catholic students to support the Civil Rights Movement and especially the sit-ins.

Through this work, Varela met Casey Hayden, who recruited her in early 1963 to work for SNCC in the Atlanta Office. This changed when Bernard Lafayette and Frank Smith, who had recently had worked in Selma, asked that Varela be assigned to work, instead, in Selma to support one of Selma's civil rights leaders, Father Maurice Ouellet, the pastor of the Black Catholic Parish. Ouellet was a strong supporter of the Movement and had opened his buildings to classes and meetings. He also made repeated requests for a literacy project to assist with voter registration. Worth Long, SNCC Alabama coordinator had also requested literacy programming and welcomed assistance from Varela.

Dissatisfied with the white middle class portrayals in literacy materials, Varela began creating materials that reflected Black people's lifestyles. After the notorious Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark shut the Selma program down by arresting Varela's project staff, she moved to Mississippi (where she herself was arrested several times) and spent the next 3 years responding to SNCC organizers' requests for adult education and training materials.

Varela was determined that these materials would show Black people taking leadership to change their segregated communities. As there were no existing materials showing Black people in action, she enlisted SNCC photographer Bob Fletcher to take pictures for her various projects. Fletcher eventually challenged her to learn photography and recommended that she study with Matt Herron in New Orleans.
Over the next 3 years, Maria Varela collaborated on a series of books and filmstrips made with photographs and utilizing taped conversations with local leaders including: Something of Our Own (how to set up an okra co-op), Holmes County, Mississippi (political organizing), To Praise Our Bridges (Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer's autobiography), and three filmstrips including one on ASCS Elections and one on Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers. She also published two poetry books: I Play Flute by Jane Stembridge and Hoe Trails by Charlie Cobb.
 
One of the responsibilities of SNCC photographers was photographing  protests to hopefully constrain and/or document any resultant police violence. In 1966, Maria Varela was assigned to shoot the Meredith March Against Fear in Mississippi where Black Power became the march's slogan. The media spun the story of Black Power as coming from militant Black northerners rather than indigenous rural southerners. One of her images showed a young local black man who had drawn a black panther on his T-shirt. "Through the lens, I saw differently", she recalled, "mirrored in the eyes of that youth was a strength and pride that had been freed from within".

==Work in Northern New Mexico Land Grant Movement==

In 1968, responding to a request from Reies Lopez Tijerina, leader of the Indio-Hispano land rights movement, Varela moved to northern New Mexico to work with the Alianza Federal land grant organization. Members of this organization were families in rural communities who had lived there for generations under community land grants from Spain and then Mexico, before this region became part of the USA. Over time, because US property law did not recognize common lands, families had lost their ancestral lands and subdivided the remainder among succeeding generations.  Poverty was rooted in these lost lands and the smaller farms which were no longer economically viable. Because Varela had worked with Black Farmers in Mississippi and Alabama, she learned there about the economic and political importance of retaining a land base. Black farmers were more independent than those who worked for plantations or the white community.  They organized politically and economically to change their communities.

The Alianza Federal seemed to speak to these issues.  For 150 years, corporate ranchers, environmentalists, and public agencies had taken over the upland areas traditionally used for summer grazing. This left the traditional livestock growers only small plots of land to graze their animals.  Their ability to expand their livestock holdings because of lack of land was one of the roots of poverty and powerlessness. Out-migration, especially of young people, was very high. Inspired by the civil rights activism in southern states, New Mexico land grant activists turned to civil disobedience in the late 1960s to protest the theft of ancestral lands. Maria was recruited to New Mexico to act as a bridge between the land grant movement and the civil rights movement. Eventually realizing that the leadership of the Alianza were uninterested in organizing at the local level to build new leadership and improve poverty and powerlessness, she left the Alianza Federal to work in a different way to support the movement.

In 1983, after helping start and run a community based clinic for 10 years, Maria co-founded and helped coordinate Ganados Del Valle/Tierra Wools, a cooperative of sheepherders, weavers, and craftspeople that strove for culturally sustainable economic development and environmental justice.  Based in Los Ojos, New Mexico,  Ganados has revitalized the economy of the Chama valley, based on the breeding of Churro sheep, a near extinct breed well suited to the area. Families organized to restore traditional livestock breeds, seeds and methods of agriculture that created the cutting edge of the 'local and natural foods' movement which now has a firm hold in U.S. popular culture. The theory was that making even the small holdings more economically viable and restoring ancestral methods of agriculture and art, that perhaps young people would see the value of staying or coming back to preserve their family land holdings. Ganados was considered a model for culturally appropriate economic development for numerous native nations as well as isolated rural communities in the southwest.

Varela also continued her photography documenting the 1968 Poor Peoples Campaign, the first Chicano Youth Conference, the 1960s and 1970s Chicano movement, and the lifestyles of Hispano villages.

In 1990 she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship for her organizing work. Varela has been the subject of a Smithsonian article on conflicts between environmentalists and land based people, was listed as 'Hero for Hard Times' by Mother Jones magazine and in 2005 was among the 1000 Women for Peace nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In addition to her primary work of supporting communities in the Southwest, Varela has been a visiting Professor at the University of New Mexico and The Colorado College and is a published author. In addition to supporting various environmental justice and immigrant rights movements, she travels the country speaking at college campuses and exhibiting her photographs.

Varela is the first Latina woman to document the 1960s civil rights struggle in the black belt south. For the last five decades, her work has been included in books and photo exhibits featured in galleries and museums, including the New York Public Library (1968), the Smithsonian (1980), the Howard Greenberg Gallery (1994), Eastman House (1998), The Colorado College (2000), Smith College (2005), a traveling exhibit, This Light of Ours (2010) and "Time to Get Ready" which included images from the civil rights  movement  and her work in northern New Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15672">'''Medical [[ghostwriter]]s''' are employed by pharmaceutical companies and medical-device manufacturers to produce apparently independent manuscripts for peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations and other communications. Physicians and other scientists are paid to attach their names to the manuscripts as though they had authored them. The named authors may have had little or no involvement in the research or writing process.&lt;ref name="Sismondo2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sismondo S |title=Ghost management: how much of the medical literature is shaped behind the scenes by the pharmaceutical industry? |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=e286 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17896859 |pmc=1989751 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040286 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and rules==
The [[American Medical Writers Association]] speaks to the topic as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amwa.org/amwa_ethics_faqs|title=AMWA Ethics FAQ|work=amwa.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716034114/http://www.amwa.org/amwa_ethics_faqs|archivedate=2013-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ghost authoring" refers to making substantial contributions without being identified as an author. "Guest authoring" refers to being named as an author without having made substantial contributions. "Ghostwriting" refers to assisting in presenting the author's work without being acknowledged. The term "ghostwriting" is often used to encompass all three of these practices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rules for authorship and contribution of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE, informally known as "the Vancouver Group" from the locale of the group's first meeting, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) are a single, universally-respected set of guidelines for describing authorship of and contribution to professional medical publications.  The document "International Committee of Medical Journal Editors: Defining the Role of Authors and Contributors"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html|title=ICMJE - Recommendations - Defining the Role of Authors and Contributors|work=icmje.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the definitive statement of ethical requirements for how authorship in medical journal articles (the prime forum for medical professional publication) and the degree to which a given writer is deemed to have contributed to the content of a medical journal article are determined. Compliance with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmje.org/urm_main.html|title=ICMJE - Recommendations|work=icmje.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is voluntary.  A list of medical journals which have stated that they follow the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmje.org/journals.html|title=ICMJE - Journals Following the ICMJE Recommendations|work=icmje.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is maintained by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.

How closely individual medical journals and authors of medical journal articles comply with ICMJE guidelines is a largely self-policed matter.  The ICMJE document "Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Publishing and Editorial Issues Related to Publication in Biomedical Journals: Corrections, Retractions and "Expressions of Concern"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icmje.org/publishing_2corrections.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330082923/http://www.icmje.org/publishing_2corrections.html |archivedate=2013-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the section of the ICMJE Uniform Requirements laying out guidelines for how potential or actual scientific error and [[Scientific misconduct|scientific fraud]] ought to be dealt with.  It refers readers to the relevant guidelines from the Committee for Publication Ethics (COPE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines|title=Guidelines|work=publicationethics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; - specifically COPE's flowcharts outlining a systematic approach toward scientific error and possible fraud.&lt;ref&gt;http://publicationethics.org/files/All%20Flowcharts%20English%2017%20July%202012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Medical ghostwriting has been criticized by a variety of professional organizations&lt;ref name="wame"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fletcher |first=Robert |year=2005 |title=Ghost writing initiated by commercial companies |journal=[[Journal of General Internal Medicine|J Gen Intern Med]] |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=549 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2005.41015.x |pmc=1490135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rennie |first=D. |last2=Flanagin |first2=A. |year=1994 |title=Authorship!

It is permitted at some institutions, including the [[University of Washington School of Medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Boseley, ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 7, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giombetti, 1992, "UW's Friendly Corporate Ghostwriter", Eat the State Vol. 6, No. 19&lt;/ref&gt; while it is prohibited and considered a particularly pernicious form of [[plagiarism]] at others, such as [[Tufts University School of Medicine]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="pogo.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krimsky |first=Sheldon |title=Science in the Private Interest: Has the Lure of Profits Corrupted Biomedical Research? |location=Lanham |publisher=Rowman-Littlefield |year=2003 |isbn=0-7425-1479-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scandals involving prominent physicians researchers have been reported at over a dozen universities in the United States, however, there have been no reports of any professors being disciplined.&lt;ref name="pogo.org"/&gt;  Professor Trudo Lemmens of the University of Toronto School of Law argues that ghostwritten papers help protect companies when they are sued in court.&lt;ref&gt;Thacker, Paul, "How Scientific Literature Has Become Part of Big Pharma's Marketing Machine and How Being Nice Hurts Canada: 5 Questions with Ghostwriting Expert Trudo Lemmens", [[Project On Government Oversight]], Jun 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most pernicious practice in ghostwriting involves thanking writers for providing “editorial assistance” in the acknowledgments section of the paper instead of the authorship byline, which essentially changes the rule of authorship attribution so that ghostwriting is acceptable. Several groups in medicine including the European Medical Writers Association (EMWA) sanction this practice. While the average reader likely interprets “editorial assistance” as help with grammar or improvements to the overall readability of the article, in reality, such “assistants” make major contributions to papers, and would commonsensically be considered co-authors. Tellingly, many medical writers are “editorial assistants” on some scientific papers, but co-authors on others. It would seem obvious that someone employed as a “medical writer” would be an author, but current dialogue on ghostwriting ignores such common-sense interpretations. Listing ghost authors as editorial assistants allows pharmaceutical companies to publish articles with conflicts-of interest that are not transparently reported. Editorial assistants are not mentioned in the abstract, are not indexed in publication databases, are not mentioned in subsequent citations, and are never mentioned in news media accounts of the article. In other words, the fact that a  pharmaceutical company directly co-authored the paper is concealed from view. That this is seen as acceptable in an era of increased disclosure of conflicts-of-interest is puzzling.

While several groups in medicine including the European Medical Writers Association (EMWA) sanction the practice of thanking medical writers for providing “editorial assistance” in the acknowledgments section of the paper instead of listing them on the authorship byline, the problem with simply thanking ghostwriters in the acknowledgements section is clearly illustrated by Study 329, probably the most notorious ghostwritten paper in the medical literature. The study examined the use of Paxil in adolescents and concluded, “Paroxetine is generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents.” Several years after the paper was published, court proceedings revealed internal company documents admitting that the study found that Paxil was not any better than placebo on the pre-registered outcome measures, and that the company was concerned about how to manage the negative findings. According to the revised ICMJE Guidelines, [[Medical writing|Professional medical writers]] who write papers are not exempt from being listed as authors of the paper  &lt;ref&gt;Leo, J., and Lacasse, J.R. (2011) Why Does Academic Medicine Allow Ghostwriting: A Prescription for Reform. Society. Vol.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
It is difficult to determine how frequently ghostwriting occurs due to its covert nature. A 2009 ''[[New York Times]]'' article estimated that 11% of ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' articles, 8% of ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'', ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' and ''[[PLoS Medicine]]'' articles, 5% of ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' articles and 2% of ''[[Nature Medicine]]'' were ghost written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/business/11ghost.html | work=The New York Times | title=Ghostwriting Is Called Rife in Medical Journals | first1=Duff | last1=Wilson | first2=Natasha | last2=Singer | date=September 11, 2009 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1998 and 2005 [[Wyeth]] had 26 papers promoting [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT) published in scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/health/research/05ghost.html |title=Ghostwriters Paid by Wyeth Aided Its Drugs - NYTimes.com |work= The New York Times|accessdate= May 12, 2010| first=Natasha | last=Singer | date=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously secret internal Wyeth documents providing evidence of this are viewable on the [[Drug Industry Document Archive]]. It also appears to have occurred in 75% of industry funded trials between 1994 - 1995 approved by the Scientific Ethical Committees for Copenhagen and Frederiksberg.&lt;ref name="Sismondo2007" /&gt;
Of the articles published from 1998 to 2000 regarding [[sertraline]], between 18% and 40%  were ghost written by [[Pfizer]].&lt;ref name="Sismondo2007"/&gt;  A questionnaire using comparable methods in 2005 and 2008 with a 14-28% response rate found a decrease in number of people who reported ghostwriting among professional medical writers.&lt;ref name=Jacob09&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=A. |last2=Hamilton |first2=A. |title=Decreased evidence of ghostwriting in a 2008 vs 2005 survey of medical writers |journal=The Write Stuff |year=2009 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=118–123 |url=http://www.emwa.org/JournalArticles/JA_V18_I2_Jacobs1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most pharmaceutical companies have in-house publication managers who may either manage the writing of publications on the company's drugs by a team of in-house medical writers or contract them out to medical communication companies or freelance medical writers. Reprints of the articles can be distributed to doctors in their offices or at medical meetings by drug company representatives ''in lieu'' of product brochures. This practice might be illegal if it effectively constitutes advertising or advocating use of the drug for non-approved indications or dosages. Payments to medical ghostwriters may be augmented with consulting contracts, paid trips to teach continuing medical education courses, or grants. The academics or doctors are known as "KOLs" ("[[Key Opinion Leader]]s") or "TLs" ("Thought Leaders").&lt;ref&gt;https://business-and-science.de/ghostwriter/werden/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senate investigation==

On June 24, 2010, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Ranking Member of the [[United States Senate]] Committee on Finance issued a report on medical ghost writing.
The report said, "The Committee was provided with documents from recent lawsuits involving Wyeth’s hormone therapy products. The documents showed that Wyeth hired a medical communications and education company, DesignWrite Inc. (DesignWrite), to draft review articles regarding the [[breast cancer]] risk of hormone therapy products and then invited academic researchers to sign on as the primary authors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | contribution = Ghostwriting in Medical Literature | title = Minority Staff Report,111th Congress, United States Senate Committee on Finance | editor-first = Charles | editor-last = Grassley | place = Washington, DC | date = June 24, 2010 | id = | contribution-url = http://grassley.senate.gov/about/upload/Senator-Grassley-Report.pdf | accessdate = 2010-07-11 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Green Corps''' is a programme of the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests]] of [[Government of India]] covering around 1,20,000 schools in [[India]] with [[NGC School Eco Clubs]]. Environmental activity in schools in India is promoted through the National Green Corps. Each NGC School Eco Club has 30 to 50 NGC Students or NGC Cadets who form the National Green Corps. These NGC Students participate in activities related to [[Biodiversity conservation|Biodiversity Conservation]], [[Water conservation|Water Conservation]], [[Energy conservation|Energy Conservation]], [[Waste management|Waste Management]] and [[Land use planning|Land Use Planning]] and [[Resource management|Resource Management]]. Locale specific issues are focused by the NGC Eco Clubs. When young girls and boys from NGC take up the [[environmental awareness]] activities and [[outreach]] activities, they attract huge public attention which eventually becomes public support for an environmental cause or environmental intervention. Water Harvesting, Plantation, [[Composting]] of [[biodegradable waste]] are most popular activities in the NGC School Eco Clubs. These NGC School Eco Clubs promote [[environmental discipline]] and [[environmental responsibility]] through the selected schools in India using environmental awareness as the medium. Each of the 250 districts in India has about 250 NGC Eco Clubs. These NGC Eco Clubs are provided with an annual grant of Rs2500. Each of the Indian State has a State Nodal Officer who implements this programme.

The NGC Children are making a huge impact in the country. [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Kerala]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Assam]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] are some of the states where this programme is making huge impact on the society. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have a separate Directorates for conducting this programme, while all other states conduct this programme through one of those organisations which is interested in environmental awareness and [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] aspects. Telangana has much more involvement than any other state. They even own a [http://www.ngc.ap.gov.in/ website]. In Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh the eco-club schools participate in the Green Schools Programme conducted by the Environment Education Unit of the [[Centre for Science and Environment]]. The eco-club schools that win awards at the state level go on to compete for the National Awards organised by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in Delhi.

Since school children are involved, most of the activities of National Green Corps children are linked to the culture and cultural aspects of conservation of [[natural resource]]s and [[Natural environment|environment]]. There are Master Trainers trained by the State Nodal Agencies with the help of the State Resource Agencies who train the Teachers-In-Charge of the NGC Eco Clubs.Each district has the District Implementation and Monitoring Committee which is supported by the District Coordinator, while at the state level the State Nodal Officer is guided by the state level Committee.

This is the largest such programme anywhere in the world. When these trained NGC Students grow up and take the environmental challenges of this second the most populous country, it is expected that there will be huge difference made to the way the resources are consumed and conserved. Andhra Pradesh is trying to groom the NGC Cadets as an environmentally disciplined force. It has introduced Uniform and Band along with a structured programme of formation of five teams of [[cadet]]s exclusively in all NGC School Eco Clubs. These NGC Cadets are the Green Brigade of the school, protecting the natural resources from misuse and promoting the conservation of the natural resources. These NGC Cadets are getting the pride place during the National Days when they participate in full NGC Uniform during the ceremonial parades along with other uniformed forces of the country.

The first ever National Conference of National Green Corps Eco Clubs is at [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] from 26 to 29 August 2010.

An '''open classroom''' is a [[student-centered]] [[learning space]] design format which first became popular in North America in the late 1960s and 1970s, with a re-emergence in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.citylab.com/design/2017/04/who-thought-open-classrooms-were-a-good-idea/524421/ “Who Thought 'Open Classrooms' Were a Good Idea?”, CityLab, April 27, 2017].  Retrieved 2017-10-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

The idea of the open classroom was that a large group of students of varying skill levels would be in a single, large classroom with several teachers overseeing them.  It is ultimately derived from the [[one-room schoolhouse]], but sometimes expanded to include more than two hundred students in a single multi-age and [[Educational stage|multi-grade]] classroom. Rather than having one teacher lecture to the entire group at once, students are typically divided into different groups for each subject according to their skill level for that subject.  The students then work in small groups to achieve their assigned goal.  Teachers serve as both facilitators and instructors. 

Certain education professionals, including Professor Gerald Unks at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], strongly support this system particularly with young children.{{cn|date=April 2017}}  If poorly planned or laid out, open classrooms can sometimes lead to problems with noise and poor ventilation.  Classrooms that are physically open are increasingly rare, as many schools that were built "without walls" have long since put up permanent partitions of varying heights.  However, in many places, the open philosophy as an instructional technique continues.&lt;ref&gt;http://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2009/12/05/fad-or-tradition-the-case-of-the-open-classroom/&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Cuban states "To call it a fad would miss the deeper meaning of “open classrooms” as another skirmish in the ideological wars that have split educational progressives from conservatives since the first tax-supported schools opened their doors in the early 1800s."{{cn|date=April 2017}}
 
Piedmont Open/IB Middle School in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], for example, was started as one of the original two magnet [[middle school]]s in Charlotte in the 1970s.  While the other magnet (a "traditional" school) has closed, Piedmont is still functioning as a modified open school thirty years later, all the time housed in a traditional physical plant.

== Open-space school ==
The '''open-space school''' concept was introduced into the [[United States]] in 1965 as an experimental elementary school architecture where the physical walls separating classrooms were removed to promote movement across class areas by teachers.   However, in practice this is not typical since teachers, following social conventions, tend to teach in a traditional manner as if the walls were still present. Further, modern open-space schools tend to use modular furniture to separate class rooms in a manner similar to "[[Cubicle farm]]s" used in many corporate environment.

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vit.vic.edu.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/1137_The-Effect-of-the-Physical-Learning-Environment-on-Teaching-and-Learning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;Advocates of open plan schools argue that students 'should be allowed to learn in ways 
suited to their individual differences' and that the most effective teaching and learning 
strategies allow teachers to work collaboratively with each other and team teach. The 
traditional classroom boxes with desks lined up in rows impede teachers' efforts to work in 
teams and have students 'in the flexible and varied groupings necessary' (Mark, J 2001:5). 

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vit.vic.edu.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/1137_The-Effect-of-the-Physical-Learning-Environment-on-Teaching-and-Learning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;Bunting agrees, saying that 'traditional classrooms must change' and proposes a model of a generic space for students to be co-located with teachers, which are decorated by the students to give them ownership, and teachers and students only move when necessary to access specialised space (Bunting, A 2004:11–12).

Klein found in a 1975 study that third graders with low levels of [[anxiety]] were more creative in open schools than in traditional school. Children with high levels of anxiety showed no differences between open-space and traditional school models. Students in open-spaced schools scored higher on preference for novelty and change.&lt;ref&gt;Elias and Elias 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2670">'''Open management education''' refers to business and management programs and courses making use of [[open educational resources]] and [[open content]]. The main idea is to develop competences by re-use, combination and adaption of freely accessible, existing resources.&lt;ref&gt;Kalz, M., Specht, M., Nadolski, R., Bastiaens, Y., Leirs, N., and Pawlowski, J.M. (2010) OpenScout: Competence based management education with community-improved open educational resources, 17th EDINEBConference: Crossing borders in Education and Work-based Learning, London, UK, June 2010, [http://hdl.handle.net/1820/2452]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and purpose ==
Programs and trainings in business and management are often not affordable, especially for SMEs or for people in less developed countries. Therefore, open management education seems like a promising alternative for many stakeholders.

== Challenges ==
It is still an ongoing discussion which [[business models]] could be applied, such as sharing or add-on models. However, the domain is still developing and no business model has become mainstream. A good discussion can be found by Downes (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Downes, S. (2007): Models for Sustainable Open Educational Resources in Interdisciplinary Journal of Knowledge and Learning Objects 3 29-44 February 27, 2007. [http://www.downes.ca/post/33401]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another challenge is to find simple tools to adapt (the sometimes complex) resources.&lt;ref&gt;Mikroyannidis, Alexander; Okada, Alexandra and Connolly, Teresa (2011). Sharing practices and experiences on the authoring and adaptation of Open Educational Resources. In: Open Educational Resources 2011, 11–13 May 2011, Manchester, UK. [http://oro.open.ac.uk/29265/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access to open management education ==
There are many repositories, databases and web access points, some of them listed here:
* [http://learn.openscout.net OpenScout] providing access to global resources in the business and management sector.  It is possible to search for competences to be achieved and to get help with tools for adaptation (e.g. internationalizing materials, adapting the design, contextualizing), see also the Wikipedia entry for [[Openscout]]
* [http://www.khanacademy.org The Khan Academy] provides a variety of business courses.
* [[MIT OpenCourseWare]] access to courses from MIT, some of them related to management
* MERLOT [http://www.merlot.org/merlot/materials.htm?category=2202 Repository] (Category Business) 
* Globe Info (Federation of Repositories): (no browsing, just use keywords such as management or better more specific) [http://www.globe-info.org/ Search page]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2729">'''PCEA Silanga High School''' is a Christian-foundation based mixed [[secondary school]] in [[Kibera]], [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. Established in January 2007 by the [[Presbyterian Church of East Africa]], Kibera Parish, under the leadership of the Rev. Samuel Machugu Kamau and Evangelist Isaac Irungu Mwangi, it caters for the educational needs of the Kibera community.

It offers a four-year course of secondary education, Form One to Form Four, leading to a [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]].

It is registered by the Ministry of Education as a formal school, as well as the Kenya National Examinations Council as an Examination Centre.

The school has about 150 students and eight full-time teachers, and offers the [[8-4-4 Curriculum|8-4-4 system]] of education (British Curriculum).

The school partners with the Barrhead Bourock Parish Churches, which is supporting ten students on full scholarships.

The principal is Daniel Misiko Lukorito.

==History==
The school came into being after an initial meeting in 2006 by members of the Barrhead Bourock Parish Churches, who saw the need and encouraged the local leaders to establish such an institution. This came into being in January 2007 when the then Rev. Samuel Kamau Machugu, Evangelist Isaac Irungu Mwangi, Patrick Gikonyo and Daniel Misiko Lukorito came together and shared the vision with the other leaders, who accepted to start the school.

The school is one of the many projects helping the community, run by the PCEA Kibera Parish. PCEA was formally called the Church of Scotland. The congregations of Bourock Parish and Barhead churches have been in the forefront in supporting the growth of the school through funding projects and structures in the school, as well as sponsoring students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kibera.bourock.org.uk/pcea.html|title=P.C.E.A. Projects|publisher=Bourock|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management structure==
The school has a Board of Governors, who oversee its running. It meets once a month to review the progress of the school. The board comprises the members of the local community, local government representatives, the principal, who is the secretary, members of the church and the local elected peoples' representatives. There are ten board members, who are elected into office every three years.

It also has a Parents/Teachers association, commonly known as the PTA. This team works in coordination with the BOG to see that the right content is covered. The PTA is made of six parents and four teachers who include the principal and the deputy principal.

:''See also [[Pico (disambiguation)]].''
'''Pico''' is a [[programming language]] developed at the Software Languages Lab at [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]. The language was created to introduce the essentials of programming to non-computer science students.

Pico can be seen as an effort to generate a palatable and enjoyable language for people who do not want to study hard for the elegance and power of a language. They have done it by adapting [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme's]] [[semantics]].

While designing Pico, the Software Languages Lab was inspired by the Abelson and Sussman's book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs". Furthermore, they were influenced by the teaching of programming at high school or academic level.

Pico should be interpreted as 'small', the idea was to create a small language for educational purposes.

== Language elements ==
=== Comments ===
Comments are surrounded by [[backquote#computer|backquote]]s ("`").

=== Variables ===
[[variable (programming)|Variables]] are dynamically [[data type|typed]]; Pico uses static [[scope (programming)|scope]].
 var: value

=== Functions ===
Functions are [[first-class object]]s in Pico. They can be assigned to variables. For example a function with two parameters param1 and param2 can be defined as:
 func(param1, param2): ...

Functions can be called with the following syntax:
 func(arg1, arg2)

=== Operators ===
Operators can be used as prefix or infix in Pico:
 +(5, 2)
 5 + 2

=== Data types ===
Pico has the following types: [[string (computer science)|string]], [[integer]], [[real number|real]] and [[array data type|tables]].

It does not have a native [[character (computing)#char|char]] type, so users should resort to size 1 strings.

Tables are compound data structures that may contain any of the regular data types.

Boolean types are represented by functions (as in [[lambda calculus]]).

=== Control structures ===
==== Conditional evaluation ====
Only the usual if statement is included
 if(condition, then, else)

== Code snippets ==
 display('Hello World', eoln)

 max(a, b):
  if(a &lt; b, b, a)

 `&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;http://www.paulgraham.com/accgen.html&lt;/span&gt;`
 foo(n): fun(i): n := n+i

[[File:2009-0725-CA-ReedleyCollege.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Reedley College]]
'''Reedley College''' often referred to as '''Reedley''', or '''RC''', is a public [[community college]] located in [[Reedley, California]], [[United States|USA]] {{convert|20|mi|km}} southeast of metropolitan [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and a three-hour drive south to [[Los Angeles]] or three-hour drive north to [[San Francisco]]. Reedley College is a part of the [[California Community Colleges system]], within the [[State Center Community College District]] (SCCCD), and fully accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]][https://web.archive.org/web/20080509172834/http://www.accjc.org/list_accred_coll.htm].  The school offers [[Associate's Degree]]s, and students can earn a Certificate of Completion, or transfer to a 4-year university of their choice. Reedley College students can choose to either pursue their AA (Associates in Arts) or their AS (Associates in Science), or obtain their GED (General Education Degree). Reedley College offers more than 80 major degrees and certificates for students to choose from.

==History==
Reedley College was founded in May 1926, as Reedley Junior College on the campus of [[Reedley High School]].  It became a full community college on July 1, 1946. In 1954, the school district voted to move Reedley College to its own campus and in 1956 it moved to its present location on {{convert|420|acre|km2}} of what was once a part of the historic Thomas Law Reed Ranch, {{convert|300|acre|km2}} remain used as farmland.  In 1963 the college joined the SCCCD and was renamed Kings River Community College in 1980. However, by popular demand, the name Reedley College was restored in July 1998.

==College Centers==
Reedley College has two college centers, Madera Community College Center and Oakhurst Community College Center.

The Madera Community College Center is located in [[Madera, California]] on {{convert|114|acre|km2}} of donated land. It was originally opened at its current site in 1996 and has slowly continued to expand since. The newest addition to the campus was the construction of the {{convert|50000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. academic village which houses state of the art computer and science labs as well as additional classroom and office space. Future expansion projects are being planned. The campus currently offers some associate degree majors as well as general education courses transferable to four-year universities.

The Oakhurst Community College Center is located in [[Oakhurst, California]] and opened at its current location in 1996 on {{convert|2.6|acre|m2}} of land. The center is housed in four buildings adjacent to the town's library.

[[Clovis Community College (California)|Clovis Community College]], formerly known as the Willow International Center, was a Reedley College Center until July 1, 2015, when it became a separate campus of the State Center Community College District.&lt;ref name=roundup&gt;{{cite news |last=Shelton |first=Valerie |date=2015-07-15 |title=Clovis now boasts the 113th community college in California |url=http://theclovisroundup.com/clovis-now-boasts-the-113th-community-college-in-california/ |newspaper=Clovis Roundup |location= |access-date=2015-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housing==
Reedley College is one of the only [[community colleges]] in the state of [[California]] to house students on campus. Sequoia Hall houses 40 women and 100 men. Sequoia Hall is located on the southern corner of the campus. One wing is for women and the other wing is for men. Construction of a new Sequoia Hall to replace the original aging facility started during the summer of 2008 and was completed in spring of 2010. The original building was razed.

==Athletics==
The Reedley College Athletic Department fields teams in 12 intercollegiate sports with five men's teams and seven women's teams. The Tigers are a member of the Central Valley Conference in all sports except for football, which is a member of the Northern California Football Alliance (NCFA). The Reedley College football team won the Northern California Football Championship, the COA State Championship, and finished #1 in the nation in 2002 with a 12-0 record. The women's basketball team has been to the COA [[Final (competition)|Final]] 16 more than 4 of the last 10 years. The women's tennis team has become a state power with an undefeated conference record since 2007 and various championship titles in recent years. Tiger athletes have gone on to four-year colleges such as [[California Golden Bears|Cal]], [[Texas Tech Red Raiders|Texas Tech]], [[Fresno State Bulldogs|Fresno State]], [[University of Oregon|Oregon]], [[Boise State Broncos|Boise State]], [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|Minnesota]], [[Texas State University–San Marcos|Texas State]], and [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]], to name a few.

'''Sophia Blackmore''' was an Australian missionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/speeches/2008/08/01/speech-by-ms-grace-fu-at-the-f.php|title=Speech at the Fairfield Methodist Secondary School 120th Founder’ Day cum Graduation Service|first=Grace|last=Fu|authorlink=Grace Fu|date=1 August 2008|publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Singapore)]]|accessdate=31 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522144013/http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/speeches/2008/08/01/speech-by-ms-grace-fu-at-the-f.php|archivedate=22 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She founded the [[Fairfield Methodist Schools]],  and also [[Methodist Girls' School, Singapore|Methodist Girls' School]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgs.sch.edu.sg/section/198|title=The MGS Story|publisher=[[Methodist Girls' School, Singapore|Methodist Girls' School]]|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Singapore]]. She was the first woman missionary sent by the Methodist Women's Foreign Missionary Society to Singapore. She also set up a boarding home for girls, supported the early Methodist Straits Chinese Christian work, published a Christian periodical in Baba Malay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1339_2008-10-10.html|title=Sophia Blackmore|publisher=[[National Library Board (Singapore)]]|accessdate=29 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is closely associated with the founding of [[Kampong Kapor Methodist Church]].

==Early life==
Born 100 miles off Sydney, Australia, Blackmore came from a devout Christian family from London who had migrated south in the 1850s. Her mother's family had had associations with missionary greats such as Robert Morrison, Robert Moffat and David Livingstone while her father was an established solicitor in New South Wales. She was one of eight children.

==Missionary Work in Singapore==

===Journey to Singapore===
Influenced by Isabella Leonard, a visiting American missionary, Blackmore left for India on 10 December 1886 with her mind set on serving China. She was sent under the auspices of the Women's Foreign Missionary Society (WFMS) of the American Methodist Episcopal Church since single women serving as missionaries were unusual and Blackmore's Australian church did not support such a venture. However, Blackmore found no permanent position when she arrived in India. Then in Madras, she met Reverend William Oldham who had gone to India for a conference. This chance meeting opened the doors for Blackmore to contribute to the growing missionary field in Malaya. To prepare for her move, Blackmore took Malay lessons from a family in Moradabad. The couple had previously resided in Singapore. It was also in Moradabad that Blackmore was officiated into the Methodist Episcopal Church.&lt;ref name=sip1339&gt;[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1339_2008-10-10.html Sophia Blackmore] Infopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
On her arrival in Singapore on 16 July 1887, Blackmore was encouraged by the Oldhams' work which included the local Methodist Episcopal Church and the Anglo-Chinese School at Coleman Street. Within a month, Blackmore helped open a school for Tamil girls on 15 August 1887, with the support of the Reverend Oldham, several members of the Indian community and a teacher named Alexander Hagedorn (Mrs Alexander Fox). Known originally as the Tamil Girls' School, the school was later renamed the Methodist Girls' School. The school started in a small shophouse on Short Street. By 1925 the school was overcrowded, which precipitated a move to Mount Sophia, where it remained there until 1992 before being moved to its current location.&lt;ref&gt;[[Methodist Girls' School, Singapore|Methodist Girls' School#History]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Visiting homes by horse-carriage in the estates bounded by Telok Ayer and Neil Road, she was led to the establishment of a second school for girls. [[Tan Keong Saik]], along with other influential Chinese families, had persuaded her to teach their daughters - an uncommon request as girls were not a priority for education amongst the Chinese then. A widow, Nonya Boon, later offered Blackmore her home along Cross Street to start a school for girls. Beginning with just eight girls, the Anglo-Chinese Girls' School began in August 1888. Under the leadership of Emma Ferris, who was principal from 1892-1894, the school grew and eventually became the Fairfield Methodist Girls' School. In 1983, the school went co-educational and the school was renamed as the Fairfield Methodist Secondary School.

Entrusted with the care of a young girl when she first arrived in Singapore, Blackmore saw the need for a home for girls. Thus on 1 May 1890, a boarding home was set up for girls. First located at Sophia Road, the home moved several times along locations up the hill until its move to a bungalow at No. 4 Sophia Road. The house stood at the pinnacle of the hillock with a bird's eye view of the city. It was known initially as the Deaconess Home because it also housed many single lady missionaries and teachers. It is now more familiarly known as Nind Home (1912) after Mary C. Nind. The home served as a residence to many of the school-going girls and several runaways, ''mui tsais'', abandoned girls and orphans. The Blackmore's girls, as they became known, were nurtured in the Christian faith and became suitable mates for Christian boys from similar homes in Malacca and Singapore.

===Churchwork===
To help her in her work, a certain Inche Ismail taught the young Blackmore High Malay. However, a form of market Malay was used as the lingua franca by the various races that poured into Singapore at the turn of the 20th century. Blackmore had therefore to adapt her knowledge of Malay in her work with the Indians, Malays and the [[Peranakan|Straits Chinese]]. She became proficient enough in local street Malay to translate hymns, and published the Baba Malay periodical, Sahabat using William Shellabear's printing press.  The paper was originally meant for women, but it became so popular that its distribution eventually went beyond Penang.

In 1894, Blackmore's home became the base for a Straits Chinese church headed by Goh Hood Keng, beginning with just six members and 16 probationers. Prior to this, Blackmore had already been preaching regularly in Malay on Sundays to girls from the Nind Home, Epworth boys' home and workers from the Missionary Press. Blackmore would accompany Reverend Goh and Dr Benjamin F. West to preach in the open-air at [[Telok Ayer]]. By 1901, the blossoming Straits Chinese church had grown large enough to move to the Christian Institute at Middle Road, and eventually moving to Kampong Kapor, when it was renamed the Straits Chinese Methodist Church, and eventually Kampong Kapor Methodist Church. The [[Kampong Kapor Methodist Church]] thus traces beginnings to Blackmore's early preaching work in the 1890s.

The Bible Women's Training School was organised to train local women to carry on the duties of Christian social work that had already been established. Blackmore was the first to head it between 1901 and 1903. The School trained Eurasian ladies and gradually Chinese women from various parts of Malaya, in home visitation. The Bible Women's Training School was considered ahead of its time in developing local, self-supporting work.
Blackmore retired to Australia in 1927 though she did make several visits to Singapore prior to the outbreak of World War II.&lt;ref name=sip1339 /&gt;

The '''United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative''' ('''UNGEI''') is an initiative launched by the [[United Nations]] in 2000 at the [[World Education Forum]] in [[Dakar]] at the [[primary school]] [[Ndiarème B]]. It aims to reduce the [[Gender inequality|gender gap]] in [[schooling for girls]] and to give girls equal access to all levels of education. 

==Principles==
Adopted at the June 13, 2008, meeting of the UNGEI Global Advisory Committee in Kathmandu, Nepal, the UNGEI vision statement is "A world where all girls and boys are empowered through quality education to realize their full potential and contribute to transforming societies where gender equality becomes a reality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ungei.org/whatisungei/index_211.html UNGEI About Us Page], ungei.com, accessed June 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

UNGEI, the EFA (Education for All) flagship for girls' education, is a partnership that embraces the United Nations system, governments, donor countries, non-governmental organizations, civil society, the private sector, and communities and families. UNGEI provides stakeholders with a platform for action and galvanizes their efforts to get girls in school.

Some of the fundamental principles of the initiative include expanding the quality of education across the globe for all, improving the equality of access to education, and focusing on gender-responsive education. Within a country's education system, the education of girls must be mainstreamed, according to the initiative.

==Process==
The UNGEI creators decided to take a 4-step approach to analyze the current education systems in order to monitor and evaluate change over time. The first step being diagnosing the current extent of girls' education in different regions. Next, locating supply factors in girls' education such as policies, reform, funding, etc. Afterward, identifying demand factors in education such as poverty, attitudes, and cultural practices affecting education rates. Lastly, pinpointing stakeholders in girls' education at various levels. Together, these steps provided UNGEI with a foundation for proper analysis of the current education system before moving forward. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=UNGEI|title=A Guidance Note to UN Country Teams|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/51e91e894.pdf/|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=The Millennium Development Goals and the United Nations Girls Education Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNICEF]] is the lead agency and Secretariat for UNGEI. A Global Advisory Committee is composed of key partners who share in the planning, decision-making, guidance and accountability of UNGEI. UNGEI Focal Points in different regions facilitate the coordination of girls' education strategies and interventions at the country level. The purpose is not, however, limited to basic education; it focuses on a systematic approach. 

At the country level, UNGEI supports country-led development and seeks to influence decision-making and investments to ensure gender equity and equality in national education policies, plans and programmes. It operates as a mechanism to advance education strategies and the technical capacity to assist countries. UNGEI partners mobilize resources for both targeted project interventions and country programmes as well as large scale systemic interventions designed to impact on the whole education system. UNGEI streamlines its efforts through the strategic use of existing mechanisms such as Poverty Reduction Strategies, sector-wide approaches and UN development assistance frameworks. 

In May 2010, UNGEI organised the E4 conference on 'Engendering Empowerment: Education and Equality', held in Dakar, Senegal, and attended by a broad range of actors from national governments, UN agencies, and civil society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNGEI|title=E4 conference|url=http://www.e4conference.org/|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members and partners==
UNGEI members are actively involved in the EFA Working Group coordinated by [[UNESCO]], the EFA Fast Track Initiative led by the [[World Bank]] and the Acceleration Strategy for Girls' Education developed by [[UNICEF]]. 

Partners include:
* UN agencies such as the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[UNESCO]], [[UNFPA]], [[UNICEF]], and the [[WFP]]
* the [[World Bank]]
* donor agencies such as the [[Danish International Development Agency]], the [[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation]], the UK's [[Department for International Development]], and [[USAID]]

{{further|List of presidents of Virginia Commonwealth University}}

===Beginnings===
[[File:Egyptian Building.JPG|thumb|350px|left|[[Egyptian Building]] of the Medical College of Virginia (1845), Richmond, Virginia]]
Although officially created with the merger of the [[Richmond Professional Institute]] (RPI) and [[Medical College of Virginia]] (MCV) in 1968, VCU's history began in 1838 when the Medical Department of Hampden-Sydney College opened in Richmond. In 1844, it moved into its first permanent home, the [[Egyptian Building]].  In 1854, the Medical Department of Hampden–Sydney College received an independent charter from the [[Virginia General Assembly]] and became the ''[[Medical College of Virginia]]'' (MCV). A few years later in 1860, MCV conveyed all its property to the Commonwealth of Virginia and becomes a state institution in exchange for $30,000.  In 1893, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, later University College of Medicine, was established by [[Hunter Holmes McGuire]] just three blocks away from MCV. In 1912, McGuire Hall opened as the new home of the University College of Medicine. The following year, MCV and UCM merged through the efforts of George Ben Johnston and Stuart McGuire. MCV acquired the Memorial Hospital as a result of the merger.

Richmond Professional Institute traces its roots back to 1917, when it began as the Richmond School of Social Work and Public Health. In 1925, it became the Richmond division of [[The College of William &amp; Mary]]. In 1939, this division became the [[Richmond Professional Institute]] of The College of William &amp; Mary" (RPI). In 1947, the MCV Foundation was incorporated, and in 1962 RPI separated from William &amp; Mary to become an independent state institution. Then in 1968, state legislation (Wayne Commission Report) merged MCV and RPI to become Virginia Commonwealth University. VCU claims 1838 as its founding date on its official seal and on promotional materials.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcu.edu/about/history.php |title=Leadership – Virginia Commonwealth University |publisher=Vcu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
In 2013, VCU was awarded a $62 million federal grant to oversee a national research consortium of universities, hospitals and clinics to study what happens to service members and veterans who suffer mild traumatic brain injuries or concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Monday, August 12, 2013 12:00 am |url=http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/latest-news/vcu-gets-million-to-study-military-brain-injuries/article_6f21ae78-02a2-11e3-bcae-0019bb30f31a.html |title=VCU to lead major study of concussions - Richmond Times-Dispatch: Latest News |publisher=Timesdispatch.com |date=2013-08-12 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/10/fact-sheet-obama-administration-s-work-honor-our-military-families-and-v |title=Fact Sheet: The Obama Administration's Work to Honor Our Military Families and Veterans &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2013-08-10 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, VCU received a $20 million National Institutes of Health grant to join a nationwide consortium of research institutions working to turn laboratory discoveries into treatments for patients.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Buckley, Anne. (2011-01-27) [http://www.news.vcu.edu/news/Carnegie_Foundation_Upgrades_VCU_to_Research_University_Very VCU News]. News.vcu.edu. Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Clinical and Translational Science Award made VCU the only academic health center in Virginia to join the prestigious CTSA network.

{{main|VCU Rams}}
Having competed at the NCAA Division I level for little more than 30 years, Virginia Commonwealth University has sponsored a broad-based program of intercollegiate athletics. The VCU Rams have won in excess of 30 conference championships, participated in numerous NCAA post-season championship events, including a run to the Final Four in men's basketball in 2011, and had a number of All-Americans—both academic and athletic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vcuathletics.com/history.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906223317/http://www.vcuathletics.com/history.php|date=September 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; VCU currently sponsors sixteen varsity teams in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I play through the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] (A10).

VCU Men's tennis is one of the school's most successful programs. The team is coached by Paul Kostin who is one of five Division I coaches to reach the 900-victory mark.

The team finished with a No. 9 ranking in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vcuathletics.com/mte/mte_history.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018035624/http://www.vcuathletics.com/mte/mte_history.php|date=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rowdy Rams===
The Rowdy Rams is a student-run athletic support organization that focuses on VCU men's basketball, while also attending and supporting the university's 16 other varsity teams. The group began during the 2002–2003 basketball season when a group of VCU Pep Band members and other students began coordinating cheers together and taking road trips to away games. The following year, the Rowdy Rams procured funding from the SGA and sponsorship from VCU's Athletic Department, solidifying themselves as an official organization.&lt;ref name="sites.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/vcurowdyrams/about-us |title=About Us - VCU Rowdy Rams |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rowdy Rams offer members priority seating to all VCU men's basketball home games, a discount card for local restaurants and businesses, a free T-shirt, and free bus trips to road games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/vcurowdyrams/team-roster-and-stats |title=Benefits - VCU Rowdy Rams |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, The Rowdy Rams followed the men's basketball team to Houston for the Final Four. Despite the team's upset by Butler University, the fan organization never regretted their trip. "Our Rowdy Rams came here in full force; the spirit was on the court; you could feel it all around the arena."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=facebook |url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2011/apr/03/tdmain14-vcu-fans-in-houston-experience-the-agony--ar-946560/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406064051/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2011/apr/03/tdmain14-vcu-fans-in-houston-experience-the-agony--ar-946560/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-04-06 |title=VCU fans in Houston experience the agony of defeat - Richmond Times-Dispatch: Richmond News, Crime &amp; Politics |publisher=.timesdispatch.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family later returned to Missouri and farming.&lt;ref name=guardianobit /&gt; Virginia enrolled at her hometown's [[Drury College]] at age 16, but dropped out and spent four years working in the Missouri state insurance office.&lt;ref name=guardianobit /&gt; She eventually returned to school, studying at the [[University of Missouri]] and the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City|Kansas City Conservatory of Music]], and during [[World War II]] began a music career as a band singer.&lt;ref name=guardianobit /&gt; She sang country music for radio station [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]] in Springfield, where she adopted the stage name Virginia Gibson.&lt;ref name=nytimesobit /&gt;

==Sexological works==
{{main|Masters and Johnson}}
Johnson met [[William Masters|William H. Masters]] in 1957 when he hired her as a research assistant at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University in St. Louis. Masters trained her in [[medical terminology]], therapy, and research during the years she worked as his assistant.&lt;ref name=missouriwomen/&gt; Together they developed polygraph-like instruments that were designed to measure [[sexual arousal]] in humans. Using these tools, Masters and Johnson observed and measured about 700 men and women who agreed to engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with other participants or [[Masturbation|masturbate]] in Masters' laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Masters and Johnson|url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/masters-and-johnson-dictionary.htm|work=Discovery Health|publisher=Sinclair Intimacy Institute|date=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By observing these subjects, Johnson helped Masters identify the four stages of sexual response. This came to be known as the [[human sexual response cycle]]. The cycle consists of the excitement phase, plateau phase, orgasmic phase, and resolution phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Stages of the Sexual Response Cycle|url=https://www.boundless.com/psychology/gender-development-and-sexuality/physiology-sex/four-stages-sexual-response-cycle/|work=Boundless|access-date=2013-04-29|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628193917/https://www.boundless.com/psychology/gender-development-and-sexuality/physiology-sex/four-stages-sexual-response-cycle/|archive-date=2013-06-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Masters and Johnson established their own independent [[nonprofit]] research institution in [[St. Louis]] called the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation. The center was renamed the [[Masters and Johnson Institute]] in 1978.

In April 2009, Thomas Maier reported in ''[[Scientific American]]'' that Johnson had serious reservations about the Masters and Johnson Institute's program to [[conversion therapy|convert homosexuals into heterosexuals]],&lt;ref&gt;Maier, Thomas (April 22, 2009).
