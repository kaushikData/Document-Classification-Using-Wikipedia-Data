'''Abdul Hamid Sharaf School''' (or '''AHSS''') is a [[private school|private]] [[school]] in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]. It was founded by [[Farid Dahdah|Farid]] and [[Sue Dahdah]], in 1980. It is named after the former [[Prime Minister of Jordan|prime minister]] [[Abdul Hamid Sharaf]], who had recently died at the time.

The school is located in the Deir Ghbar neighborhood of West Amman not far from the American Embassy, the British Embassy and The French School. The easiest ways to reach the school are to exit from the airport highway or to come from the sixth circle (see location map).

The school building and grounds are located on six and one half dunums (1½ acres).

Facilities include:
* Twenty-five classrooms
* Two Computer Labs
* Language Resource Room
* Library
* Auditorium
* Music Room
* Art Room
* Physics, Chemistry, and Biology Labs
* Special Education Center
* Vocational Training and Woodworking Shop
* Home Economics Room
* Soccer, basketball, volleyball courts
* Elementary school playgrounds
* Bookstore, uniform store, and canteen

AHSS was reaccredited in spring 2009 by the [[North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement]] (NCA CASI) a division of AdvancED.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advanc-ed.org/oasis2/u/par/accreditation/summary?institutionId=36080 Institution Summary], AdvancED, Retrieved 2012-07-08&lt;/ref&gt; Among the advantages of accreditation, graduates of the American high school program at AHSS can obtain equalization for their school diploma from the Jordanian Ministry of Education. Equalization is necessary for students who plan to do their college or university studies in Jordan.

AHSS is an associate member of the [[Near East South Asia Council of Overseas Schools]] (NESA). Dr. Sue Dahdah has been a member since 1971 while AHSS has been since 1980. School representatives attend the annual administrators' and teachers' conferences organized by NESA throughout the Near Eastern and South Asian regions.

Uniform is worn by grades one through seven, comprising navy blue pants or culottes, white shirts and turquoise or navy blue cardigans and pullovers. Neckties and scarves are worn for formal occasions. For physical education, white school T-shirt, shorts and training suit are worn. Uniform is not required for students in grades eight through twelve although a dress code is in effect.

== Curriculum ==
The school teaches two curricula: 
* An American curriculum is taught which prepares students to write the Scholastic Aptitude Test ([[SAT]]) and the Scholastic Aptitude Subject Tests (SAT II). This curriculum is aimed at the students who are from the United States and plan to return there for their post-secondary education. Although completion of the SAT stream and passing marks in the SAT and SAT II tests is recognized by Jordanian universities as proof of secondary education it is not looked favorably upon. 
* The [[IGCSE|International General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (IGCSE) curriculum is also taught. This prepares students for the O level and A level exams which are internationally recognized as proof of secondary education. Passing marks in the O and A level exams are recognized as completion of secondary education by most Jordanian Universities. This stream is often chosen by students who plan to continue into post-secondary education outside of Jordan or in a Jordanian university which teaches in English.

'''Age appropriateness''' or '''child-friendly''' is the progression of [[Norm (social)|behavioral norms]] largely agreed upon within a society or among sociological and psychological authorities to be appropriate to a child's development of social skills. These behaviors are divided into a number of [[child development stages|development stages]] based upon the child's age.

Lack of exposure to age appropriate activities and experiences is commonly thought to prevent a child from gaining the skills necessary for their current and thus their next stage of development.

== Toys ==

In the United States, age determination guidelines for toys and games are suggested by the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) and consider child development (for children under 12 years of age) and toy characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cpsc.gov/PageFiles/112234/adg.pdf|title=AGE DETERMINATION GUIDELINES: Relating Children’s Ages To Toy Characteristics and Play Behavior|last=Therrell|first=James A.|date=2002-09-01|editor-last=Smith|editor-first=Timothy P.|website=|publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)|others=Play Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering child development, the CPSC looks at the physical development, cognitive development, emotional development and social development of children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The CPSC guidelines are then separated into four categories which include: play categories, toy subcategories, age groups, and toy characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Media and film ==

[[Content rating]]s often indicate at which age that content is considered by the rating body to be age-appropriate. For example, in the United States, [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-14|TV-14]] indicates that the television program contains some material that many parents would find unsuitable for children under 14 years old; it is the equivalent to [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13]] for motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Both ratings mean "parents strongly cautioned" and set up a similar age recommendation.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was dissolved in December 1918 following conflict with the [[Bolsheviks]].

==Conflict with Bolsheviks==
After the Bolshevik seizure of power in the [[October Revolution]], the VUS went on strike along with officials of the [[Ministry of Education]] and the State Education Committee. The [[Petrograd]] branch of the VUS resolved "not to perform the instructions of the self-styled power."&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Commissariat of Enlightenment: Soviet Organization of Education and the Arts under Lunacharsky, October 1917-1921 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Fitzpatrick, Sheila | year=2002 | location=Cambridge | pages=34 | isbn=978-0-521-07919-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stayed out on strike until 6 January 1918. The [[Moscow]] branch, with around 4000 members, joined the strike of municipal workers, and remained on strike until 11 March 1918.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick" /&gt; The Bolsheviks claimed that the VUS was receiving financial backing from [[Pavel Ryabushinsky]]. [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] commented in ''Petrogradskii uchitel'':
:'We are obliged to dismiss ''for ever'' from school activity these honourable gentlemen who, in spite of our appeal, prefer to continue in the role of political matadors rather than the role of teachers.
:'I do not know what quantity of repentant tears the individual teachers may, in the eyes of the people, wash away the black letters which he himself has painted on his forehead: ''"In December 1917, in the hour of the people's terrible struggle against the exploiters, I refused to teach the children and received money for this from the exploiters' funds."''

'''Arthur Robert Jensen''' (August 24, 1923&amp;nbsp;– October 22, 2012) was an American psychologist and author. He was a professor of [[educational psychology]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.edb.utexas.edu/robinson/danr/JEBS%2031(3)%20-06_Jensen%20profile.pdf |title=Arthur Jensen |publisher=Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401053715/http://www.edb.utexas.edu/robinson/danr/JEBS%2031%283%29%20-06_Jensen%20profile.pdf |archivedate=2010-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jensen was known for his work in [[psychometrics]] and [[differential psychology]], the study of how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another.

He was a major proponent of the [[hereditarianism|hereditarian]] position in the [[nature and nurture]] debate, the position that [[genetics]] play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and [[personality psychology|personality]]. He was the author of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals&lt;ref name="JensenCollectedWorks2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arthurjensen.net/?page_id=9 |title=Collected works |newspaper=Arthurjensen.net |date=  |author= |accessdate= August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sat on the editorial boards of the [[scientific journals]] ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'' and ''[[Personality and Individual Differences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Intelligence''[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaleditorialboard.cws_home/620195/editorialboard] and ''Personality and Individual Differences''[http://authors.elsevier.com/JournalDetail.html?PubID=603&amp;Precis=EB] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021028165418/http://authors.elsevier.com/JournalDetail.html?PubID=603&amp;Precis=EB |date=2002-10-28 }} publisher's pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was rated as one of the 50 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/e413802005-787|title=The 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the Twentieth Century|year=2001|last1=Haggbloom|first1=Steven J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a controversial figure, largely for his conclusions regarding the causes of [[race and intelligence|race-based differences in intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Panofsky |first1=Aaron | title=Misbehaving Science. Controversy and the Development of Behavior Genetics |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-05831-3 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jensen was born August 24, 1923, in [[San Diego]], California, the son of Linda Mary (née Schachtmayer) and Arthur Alfred Jensen, who operated and owned a lumber and building materials company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_kZAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Linda+Mary+Schachtmayer |title=Current biography yearbook |publisher=H.W. Wilson Company |accessdate=2012-10-28|isbn=9780824205430 |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandparents were Danish immigrants and his mother was of half [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] and half German descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Intelligence, race, and genetics: conversations with Arthur R. Jensen |last1=Jensen |first1=Arthur Robert |last2=Miele |first2=Frank |edition=illustrated |year=2002 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-8133-4008-1 |page=242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at [[University of California, Berkeley]] (B.A. 1945), [[San Diego State College]] (M.A., 1952) and [[Columbia University]] (Ph.D., 1956), and did his doctoral thesis with [[Percival Symonds]] on the [[Thematic Apperception Test]]. From 1956 through 1958, he did postdoctoral research at the [[University of London]], [[Institute of Psychiatry]] with [[Hans Eysenck]].

Upon returning to the [[United States]], he became a researcher and professor at the [[University of California]], Berkeley, where he focused on individual differences in learning, especially the influences of [[culture]], development, and genetics on intelligence and learning. He received [[tenure]] at Berkeley in 1962 and was given his first [[sabbatical]] in 1964. He concentrated much of his work on the learning difficulties of culturally disadvantaged students.

Jensen had a lifelong interest in classical music and was, early in his life, attracted by the idea of becoming a [[Conducting|conductor]] himself. At 14, he conducted a [[Band (music)|band]] that won a nationwide [[competition|contest]] held in [[San Francisco]]. Later, he conducted orchestras and attended a [[seminar]] given by [[Nikolai Sokoloff]]. Soon after graduating from Berkeley, he moved to [[New York City|New York]], mainly to be near the conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]]. He was also deeply interested in the life and example of [[Gandhi]], producing an unpublished book-length manuscript on his life. During Jensen's period in [[San Diego]] he spent time working as a [[social worker]] with the San Diego Department of Public Welfare.

==IQ and academic achievement==
Jensen's interest in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of school children. The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability. ''Level I'', or [[associative learning]], may be defined as retention of input and rote memorization of simple facts and skills. ''Level II'', or conceptual learning, is roughly equivalent to the ability to manipulate and transform inputs, that is, the ability to solve problems.

Later, Jensen was an important advocate in the mainstream acceptance of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|general factor of intelligence]], a concept which was essentially synonymous with his ''Level II'' conceptual learning. The general factor, or ''g'', is an abstraction that stems from the observation that scores on all forms of cognitive tests correlate positively with one another.

Jensen claimed, on the basis of his research, that [[Heritability of IQ|general cognitive ability is essentially an inherited trait]], determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions. He also contended that while associative learning, or memorizing ability, is equally distributed among the races, conceptual learning, or synthesizing ability, occurs with significantly greater frequency in whites than in non-whites.

Jensen's most controversial work, published in February 1969 in the ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'', was titled "[[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?]]" It concluded, among other things, that [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]] programs designed to boost [[African-American]] [[IQ]] scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in Jensen's estimation, 80% of the variance in IQ in the population studied was the result of genetic factors and the remainder was due to environmental influences.&lt;ref name="High"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v3p652y1977-78.pdf |title=High Impact Science and the Case of Arthur Jensen |format=PDF |date=9 October 1978 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work became one of the most cited papers in the [[history]] of [[psychological testing]] and [[Psychometrics|intelligence research]], although a large number of citations consisted of rebuttals of Jensen's work, or references to it as an example of a controversial paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Wendy |title=Developmental Psychology: Revisiting the Classic Studies |editor1-last=Slater |editor1-first=Alan M. |editor2-last=Quinn |editor2-first=Paul C. |chapter=How Much Can We Boost IQ?

After the paper was released, large protests were held, demanding that Jensen be fired. Jensen's car tires were slashed, the university police provided him with plain-clothes bodyguards, and he and his family received threats that were considered so realistic by the police that they temporarily left their house. Jensen was spat on and was prevented from delivering lectures by disruptive protests. The editorial board of the ''Harvard Educational Review'' for a time refused to let him have reprints of his article, and said that they had not solicited the section on racial differences; Jensen later provided correspondence in which the board had requested he do so.&lt;ref name="scarr"&gt;{{cite journal|title=On Arthur Jensen's integrity|journal=Intelligence|date=1 January 1998|volume=26|issue=3|pages=227–232|doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(99)80005-1|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289699800051|language=en|issn=0160-2896|last1=Scarr|first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nyborg|first1=Helmuth|title=The Scientific Study of General Intelligence: Tribute to Arthur Jensen|date=2003|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080516660|pages=458–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPNFXBnwuNoC&amp;pg=PA458|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Information|first1=Reed Business|title=New Scientist|date=1972|publisher=Reed Business Information|pages=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYqAz8FJbzwC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Jensen1.jpg|right|thumb|Arthur Jensen winning the 2003 [[Kistler Prize]].]] --&gt;
In a later article, Jensen argued that his claims had been misunderstood:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...nowhere have I "claimed" an "innate deficiency" of intelligence in blacks. My position on this question is clearly spelled out in my most recent book: "The plain fact is that at present there exists no scientifically satisfactory explanation for the differences between the IQ distributions in the black and white populations. The only genuine consensus among well-informed scientists on this topic is that the cause of the difference remains an open question." (Jensen, 1981a, p. 213).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although a critic of Jensen's thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|journal=Change|volume=5|issue=4|pages=33–37|jstor=40161749|title=Arthur Jensen and His Critics: The Great IQ Controversy|year=May 1973|quote=Even for one who disagrees, as I do, with the main conclusions of the analysis...|doi=10.1080/00091383.1973.10568506}}&lt;/ref&gt; economist [[Thomas Sowell]], criticizing the taboo against research on [[race and intelligence]], wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Professor Jensen pointed out back in 1969 that black children's IQ scores rose by 8 to 10 points after he met with them informally in a play room and then tested them again after they were more relaxed around him. He did this because "I felt these children were really brighter than their IQ would indicate." What a shame that others seem to have less confidence in black children than Professor Jensen has had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://townhall.com/columnists/ThomasSowell/2002/10/01/race_and_iq?page=full |title=Race and IQ|author=Thomas Sowell|date=October 1, 2002|accessdate=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Jensen's 1998 ''[[The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability]]'' gives his position suggesting a genetic component is implicated in the white-black difference in IQ. In Chapter 12: Population Differences in ''g'': Causal Hypotheses, Jensen writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The relationship of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] to a number of biological variables and its relationship to the size of the white-black differences on various cognitive tests (i.e., [[Spearman's hypothesis]]) suggests that the average white-black difference in ''g'' has a biological component. Human races are viewed not as discrete, or [[Platonism|Platonic]], categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes. The genetic distances between various populations form a continuous variable that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies. Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly ''g''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on "[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]],&lt;ref name="gottfredson"&gt;Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]. ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', p A18.&lt;/ref&gt; " an editorial written by [[Linda Gottfredson]] and published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on the meaning and significance of IQ following the publication of the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.

Today, it still funds studies of race and intelligence, as well as eugenics, the "science" of breeding superior human beings that was discredited by various Nazi atrocities. The Pioneer Fund has supported many of the leading Anglo-American race scientists of the last several decades as well as anti-immigration groups such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR).
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fund contributed a total of $3.5 million to researchers cited in The Bell Curve's most controversial chapter "that suggests some races are naturally smarter than others" with Jensen's works being cited twenty-three times in the book's bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Montagu  | first = Ashley  | title = Race and IQ  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = New York  | year = 2002 | edition = 2 | isbn = 9780195102215 | quote = And many of The Bell Curve's most important assertions which establish causal links between IQ and social behavior, and IQ and race, are derived partially or totally from the Mankind Quarterly Pioneer Fund scholarly circle.

He has received $1.1 million from the Pioneer Fund.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Jensen's article, co-written with [[J. Philippe Rushton]], named "Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability", was published in the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] journal ''[[Psychology, Public Policy and Law]]''. Jensen and Rushton present ten categories of evidence in support of the notion that IQ differences between whites and blacks are partly genetic in origin.&lt;ref name="30years"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability |journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law |volume=11 |number=2 |pages=235–294 |year=2005 |url=http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/PPPL1.pdf |doi=10.1037/1076-8971.11.2.235 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722020238/http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/pppl1.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-22 |last1=Rushton |first1=J.

==Assessment==

[[Melvin Konner]] of Emory University, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Statements made by Arthur Jensen, William Shockley, and other investigators in the late 1960s and early 1970s about race and IQ or social class and IQ rapidly passed into currency in policy discussions. Many of these statements were proved wrong, but they had already influenced some policymakers, and that influence is very difficult to recant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Paul E. Meehl]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], after being honored by the APA, wrote that Jensen's "contributions, in both quality and quantity, certainly excelled mine" and that he was "embarrassed" and "distress[ed]" that APA refused to honor Jensen out of ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meehl|first1=Paul E.|title=PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SCIENTIST: LXXVIII.

According to [[David Lubinski]] of Vanderbilt University, the "extent to which [Jensen's] work was either admired or reviled by many distinguished scientists is unparalleled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=PsycNET|journal=Psycnet.apa.org|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-26324-017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Scarr]] of Yale University wrote that Jensen possessed an "uncompromising personal integrity" and set the standard for "honest psychological science". She contrasted him and his work favorably to some of his critics, who she called "politically driven liars, who distort scientific facts in a misguided and condescending effort to protect an impossible myth about human equality".&lt;ref name="scarr" /&gt;

[[Lisa Suzuki]] and [[Joshua Aronson]] of [[New York University]] wrote that Jensen had largely ignored evidence which failed to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent genetic racial differences.&lt;ref&gt;''The cultural malleability of intelligence and its impact on the racial/ethnic hierarchy'' L Suzuki, J Aronson&amp;nbsp;– Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jensen's death, [[James Flynn (academic)|James Flynn]] of the University of Otago, a prominent advocate of the environmental position, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Jensen was without racial bias and had not initially foreseen that his research would be used to argue for racial supremacy and that his career was "emblematic of the extent to which American scholarship is inhibited by political orthodoxy", though he noted that Jensen shifted towards genetic explanations later in life.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

[[Francis Crick]], the co-discoverer of DNA, considered that there was "much substance to Jensen's arguments" and that it was "likely that more than half the difference between the average I.Q. of American whites and Negroes is due to genetic reasons, and will not be eliminated by any foreseeable change in the environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Francis |first1=Crick, |title=Letter from Francis Crick to John T. Edsall, Fogarty International Center |url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/SCBBNM |website=profiles.nlm.nih.gov |language=English |date=22 February 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleontologist and evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticized Jensen's work in his 1981 book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''. Gould writes that Jensen misapplies the concept of "[[heritability]]", which is defined as a measure of the [[Genetic diversity|variation]] of a trait due to inheritance ''within'' a population (Gould 1981: 127; 156-157). According to Gould, Jensen uses heritability to measure differences ''between'' populations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/t/The_Mismeasure_of_Man.htm|title=The Mismeasure of Man|website=www.cs.mcgill.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Gould also disagrees with Jensen's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, ''g'', or "the [[general factor]] common to a large number of cognitive abilities" which can be measured along a unilinear scale.

This is a claim most closely identified with [[Charles Spearman]]. According to Gould, Jensen misunderstood the research of [[L. L. Thurstone]] to ultimately support this claim; Gould, however, argues that Thurstone's [[factor analysis]] of intelligence revealed ''g'' to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314). Gould criticizes Jensen's sources including his use of [[Catharine Cox]]'s 1926 ''Genetic Studies of Genius'', which examines [[historiometric]]ally the IQs of historic intellectuals after their deaths (Gould 1981: 153-154).

In 1980 Jensen published a detailed book in defense of the tests used to measure mental abilities, entitled ''[[Bias in Mental Testing]]''. Reviewing this book, psychologist [[Kenneth Kaye]] endorsed Jensen's distinction between bias and discrimination, saying that he found many of Jensen's opponents to be more politically-biased than Jensen was.&lt;ref&gt;K. Kaye, ''The Sciences'', January 1981, pp. 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jensen's response and criticism==
In Arthur Jensen's response to Gould's criticisms, in the paper titled ''The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/jensen-gould-fossils ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327023519/http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/jensen-gould-fossils |date=March 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen begins his paper with this observation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and offers a course at Harvard entitled, "Biology as a Social Weapon." Apparently the course covers much the same content as does the present book. Having had some personal cause for interest in ideologically motivated attacks on biologically oriented behavioral scientists, I first took notice of Gould when he played a prominent role in a group called Science for the People and in that group's attack on the theories of Harvard zoologist [[Edward O. Wilson]], a leader in the development of sociobiology...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Jensen recognizes the validity of some of Gould's claims, in many places, he criticizes Gould's general approach:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This charge of a social, value-laden science undoubtedly contains an element of truth. In recent years, however, we recognize this charge as the keystone of the Marxist interpretation of the history of science.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jensen adds that Gould made a number of misrepresentations, whether intentional or unintentional, while purporting to present Jensen's own positions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In his references to my own work, Gould includes at least nine citations that involve more than just an expression of Gould's opinion; in these citations Gould purportedly paraphrases my views. Yet in eight of the nine cases, Gould's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured. Nonspecialists could have no way of knowing any of this without reading the cited sources. While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears Gould's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jensen expressed considerably greater praise of his frequent intellectual sparring partner, [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now and then I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind. His book, ''Race, IQ and Jensen'' (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jensen |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Jensen |editor1-last=Modgil |editor1-first=Sohan |editor2-last=Modgil |editor2-first=Celia |title=Arthur Jensen: Consensus and Controversy |date=1987 |publisher=Falmer Press |location=London |series=Falmer international master-minds challenged; 4 |isbn=978-1-85000-093-8 |page=379 |chapter=Chapter 21: Differential Psychology: Towards Consensus |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Books==

=== Bias in Mental Testing ===
''[[Bias in Mental Testing]]'' (1980) is a book examining the question of test bias in commonly used [[standardized test]]s. The book runs almost 800 pages and has been called "exhaustive" by three researchers who reviewed the field 19 years after the book's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Robert T.|last2=Reynolds|first2=Cecil R.|last3=Whitaker|first3=Jean S.|title=Bias in mental testing since Bias in Mental Testing.|journal=School Psychology Quarterly|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=208–238|doi=10.1037/h0089007|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reviewed in detail the available evidence about [[Intelligence quotient#Test bias|test bias]] across major US racial/ethnic groups. Jensen concluded that "the currently most widely used standardized tests of mental ability -- IQ, scholastic aptitude, and achievement tests -- are, by and large, not biased against any of the native-born English-speaking minority groups on which the amount of research evidence is sufficient for an objective determination of bias, if the tests were in fact biased. For most nonverbal standardized tests, this generalization is not limited to English-speaking minorities." (p. ix). Jensen also published a summary of the book the same year which was a target article in the journal ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'' to which 27 commentaries were printed along with the author's reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Arthur R.|date=September 1980|title=Précis of Bias in Mental Testing|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/precis-of-bias-in-mental-testing/5C0CA7E5F76D49C368102F444BC4E571|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=325–333|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00005161|issn=1469-1825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''g'' Factor===
''[[The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability (book)|The ''g'' Factor: The Science of Mental Ability]]'' (1998) is a book on the [[general intelligence factor]] (''g''). The book deals with the intellectual history of g and various models of how to conceptualize intelligence, and with the biological correlates of g, its heritability, and its practical predictive power.

===Clocking the Mind===
''Clocking the Mind : Mental Chronometry and Individual Differences'' (2006) deals with [[mental chronometry]] (MC), and covers a variety of techniques for measuring the speed with which the brain processes information.  Whereas [[IQ]] merely represents an interval (ranking) scale and thus possesses no true ratio scale properties, Jensen argues mental chronometry represents a true natural science of mental ability.

==Awards==
In 2003, Jensen was awarded the [[Kistler Prize]] for original contributions to the understanding of the connection between the human [[genome]] and human [[society]]. In 2006, the [[International Society for Intelligence Research]] awarded Jensen its Lifetime Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isironline.org/2006-lifetime-achievement-award/|title=2006 Lifetime Achievement Award|newspaper=isironline.org|publisher=International Society for Intelligence Research|date=December 25, 2006|accessdate=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Balelec Festival''' is a large musical event organised by students in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24heures.ch/vaud-regions/lausanne-region/Le-festival-Balelec-seduit-malgre-la-pluie/story/11492619 "Le festival Balelec séduit malgré la pluie"]. ''24 Heures''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24heures.ch/vaud-regions/labo24/Chers-festivaliers-c-est-le-printemps/story/22475222 "Chers festivaliers, c'est le printemps"]. ''24 Heures''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually the first open-air music festival happening in Switzerland each year during Spring. It is organised by volunteers on the campus of [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdg.ch/suisse/Le-festival-Balelec-vu-du-ciel/story/26952999 "Le festival Balélec vu du ciel"]. ''Tribune de Geneve'', Xurxo-Adrián Entenza 22.05.2012&lt;/ref&gt; near the [[lake Geneva]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] around the beginning of May.

The festival is known to happen in a rainy day. It has been held at [[EPFL]] since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.7skymagazine.ch/site/people/de/news/festival-balelec "Festival Balelec"]. ''People Magazine''.  Sacha Voeffray&lt;/ref&gt; Each year on a Friday night the school welcomes 15'000 people (since 2003) and 30 live concerts. In 2011,  the Balelec Festival is held its 31st edition, while in 2012,  the Balelec Festival is held its 32nd edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20min.ch/ro/sortir/nightfever/story/Balelec-frappe-tres-fort-et-dans-tous-les-styles-14348750 "20 minutes - Balélec frappe très fort et dans tous les styles - Nightfever"]. ''20 Minutes''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francomix.com/breve-Festival_Balelec_2011_a_Lausanne_programme_et_clips-1246.html "Festival Balélec 2011 à Lausanne : programme et clips"]. ''francomix.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about excessive consumption of alcohol at the festival are denied by the organizers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20min.ch/ro/musique/festivals/story/-A-Balelec--l-alcool-n-est-pas-un-souci--15748682 "A Balélec, l'alcool n'est pas un souci"]. ''20 Minutes'', May 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 and again in 2016, the festival once again attracted a sold out crowd of about 15,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24heures.ch/culture/culture/Balelec-repart-pour-un-tour/story/30137364 "Balélec repart pour un tour"]. ''24 heures'', 27 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The budget for the 2016 festival was 650,000 swiss francs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20min.ch/ro/musique/news/story/La-bonne-humeur-a-ete-au-rendez-vous-a-Balelec-21123095?redirect=mobi&amp;nocache=0.44673015944797323 "La bonne humeur a été au rendez-vous à Balélec"]. ''20 Minutes'', May 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The association ==

The Balelec Festival is a [[student association]] listed as a [[non-profit organization]]. A part of the funds to mount the festival comes from sponsorships and the other part comes from the tickets sold for the event. The student association has an overall budget of 800'000 CHF . All the money earned during the event is used to fund the next edition.

The association is composed of a main committee of 50 volunteers, mostly [[EPFL]] and [[university of Lausanne|UNIL]] students, who are divided into four teams: Animation, Logistics, Promotion and Internal Resources.  In addition, more than 300 volunteers and professional staff help with the setup on campus during the week preceding the event. On site, there are seven musical indoor and outdoor stages and about 30 live concerts, depending of the year.

== Outdoor stages ==

The main live stages of the festival are outdoors. These 2 stages are called the '''Grande Scene''' (the main stage) and the '''Scene Azimuts'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://indie-nation.org/2015/05/13/festival-balelec-epfl-campus-lausanne-08-05-2015/ "Festival Balélec, EPFL Campus, Lausanne, 08.05.2015"]. ''Indie Nation'', May 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The main stage has an eclectic musical line-up while the other one is more rock/metal oriented. In 2012, the volume on these outdoor stages led to complaints from  neighbouring residents, leading to a reduction in the volume of the bass frequencies in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20min.ch/ro/news/vaud/story/31164716?redirect=mobi&amp;nocache=0.575389408341682 "20 minutes - Balélec joue les pionniers pour calmer ses voisins - Vaud"]. ''20 Minutes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indoor stages ==

Indoor, the festival owns 4 scenes. The '''Satellite Scene''' is a live stage put in place with the collaboration of another [[EPFL]] student association called [[Satellite]]. Its line-up is oriented toward chanson française and [[balkan music]]. The festival has also two electronic music stages called the '''Coupole''' and the '''SoundGate''', the last one taking place in the Faculty of Architecture's hall. The last indoor scene is called the '''Dome''' with a nightclub ambiance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indie-nation.org/2015/05/13/festival-balelec-epfl-campus-lausanne-08-05-2015/ "Festival Balélec, EPFL Campus, Lausanne, 08.05.2015"]. ''Indie Nation'', May 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beirut Art Center''' is a space for exhibiting contemporary art in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]

== History ==
Beirut Art Center opened to public in January 2009. It is managed as a non-profit organization whose founders and executive board members are: [[Sandra Dagher]], [[Lamia Joreige]], Nathalie Khoury, [[Rabih Mroué]] and Maria Ousseimi&lt;ref name="BAC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beirutartcenter.org/who-we-are.php |title=Beirut Art Center |author= |year=2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project roots in the growing interest to local contemporary art. It was an initiative of Sandra Dagher, who previously curated a private art space, Espace SD, and Lamia Joreige, visual artist.&lt;ref name="Universes in Universes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2009/beirut_art_center|work=Beirut Art Center. Nafas Art Magazine|title=Beirut Art Center|publisher=Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations (ifa), Germany, Elke aus dem Moore, in cooperation with Universes in Universe - Worlds of Art|accessdate=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Sandra Dagher curated with [[Saleh Barakat]], owner of Agial Art Gallery in Beirut, the first Lebanese Pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref name="Venice Biennale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanonvenicebiennale.com/|work=52nd International art exhibition|title=Pavilion of Lebanon|accessdate=2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071005233349/http://www.lebanonvenicebiennale.com/| archivedate= 5 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[New York City]]'s [[New Museum]] hosted “Museum as Hub: Beirut Art Center” a project that includes an exhibition, the presentation of Beirut Art Center’s Médiathèque, and a series of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/451 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905230953/http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/451 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 September 2012 |title=Museum as Hub: Beirut Art Center: Due to unforeseen events... |author= |year=2011 |work= |publisher=New Museum |accessdate=22 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After co-founders Sandra Dagher and Lamia Joreige have been in charge of the BAC for five years, [[Marie Muracciole]] was appointed in February 2014 to take its direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutbeirut.com/beirut/article/13391/announcing-the-new-director-of-beirut-art-center.html|title=Nomination announcement in Timeout of Marie Muracciole at the direction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building ==
The BAC is in Jisr el Wati, an industrial area on the banks of [[Beirut River]]. The building has been refurbished by architect Raed Abillama from a factory into a white cube space.&lt;ref name="Global Art and the Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalartmuseum.de/site/moca_of_the_month/135 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222153633/http://www.globalartmuseum.de/site/moca_of_the_month/135 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 February 2011 |title=Global Art and the Museum: MoCA of the Month |author= |year=2010 |work= |publisher=ZKM |accessdate=14 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1500 sq m space occupies 2 floors. The ground floor includes the main exhibition space, a book store and an auditorium. The first floor includes a secondary exhibition space, a médiathèque, a cafe with a terrasse, and the administrative offices.

The [[British Film Institute]] (BFI) is a charitable organisation established in 1933, based in the United Kingdom.  It has awarded its Fellowship title to individuals in "recognition of their outstanding contribution to film or television culture" and is considered the highest accolade presented by the Institute:&lt;ref name=boyle/&gt; British actor [[John Hurt]] said the award was "the highest honour possible".&lt;ref name="year09"/&gt;

The first awards were made in 1983, the same year as [[BFI National Archive]]'s [[Silver Jubilee]] and the BFI's fiftieth anniversary, and as of February 2017, there are 85 Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/about-bfi/senior-staff-governors-bfi-fellows/bfi-fellows| title = BFI Fellows| publisher = British Film Institute| accessdate = 21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Awards are not presented every year, but every award ceremony has been held in London, on occasion at the [[BFI Southbank|National Film Theatre]] as part of the [[BFI London Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="year09"/&gt;  The inaugural ceremony honoured six recipients of the Fellowship: French film director [[Marcel Carné]], British film directors [[David Lean]], [[Michael Powell]], Hungarian screenwriter [[Emeric Pressburger]], Indian film-maker [[Satyajit Ray]] and American director and actor [[Orson Welles]]. The most recent Fellowship was bestowed in 2017 on British director [[Paul Greengrass]].&lt;ref name="greengrass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/announcements/paul-greengrass-bfi-fellowship|title=Paul Greengrass to receive BFI Fellowship at BFI London Film Festival Awards Ceremony|date=29 August 2017|work=[[British Film Institute]]|access-date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following allegations of numerous sexual assaults and harassment allegations, American producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] was stripped of the fellowship that was originally awarded to him in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-41664814 | title =Harvey Weinstein stripped of British Film Institute Fellowship | date = 19 October 2017 | accessdate = 19 October 2017 |publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 85 Fellows, the majority (56) are from the United Kingdom, with 29 foreign recipients, mainly from the United States and France.  There have been two African winners, both film directors, Malian [[Souleymane Cissé]] and Senegalese [[Ousmane Sembène]] while one recipient has come from each of Japan, India, Iran, and Canada.

:''Freinet redirects here, there is also a village [[La Garde-Freinet]] in the French [[Arrondissement of Draguignan]] (Var)''
{{Expand French|date=November 2010|Célestin Freinet}}
'''Célestin Freinet''' (15 October 1896 in [[Gars, Alpes-Maritimes]] &amp;ndash; 8 October 1966 in [[Vence]]) was a noted French [[Pedagogy|pedagogue]] and [[Education reform|educational reformer]].

== Early life ==
Freinet was born in [[Provence]] as the fifth of eight children. His own schooldays were deeply unpleasant to him and would affect his teaching methods and desire for reform. In 1915 he was recruited into the French army and was wounded in the [[lung]], an experience that led him to becoming a resolute [[pacifism|pacifist]].

In 1920 he became an elementary schoolteacher in the village of [[Le Bar-sur-Loup]]. It was here that Freinet began to develop his teaching methods.  He married Élise Lagier in 1926.

== Educational reforms ==
In 1923 Freinet purchased a [[printing press]], originally to assist with his teaching, since his lung injury made it difficult for him to talk for long periods. It was with this press he printed free texts and class newspapers for his students. The children would compose their own works on the press and would discuss and edit them as a group before presenting them as a team effort. They would regularly leave the classroom to conduct [[field trip]]s. The newspapers were exchanged with those from other schools. Gradually the group texts replaced conventional school books.

Freinet created the teachers' [[trade union]] C.E.L. (Coopérative de l'Enseignement Laïc) in 1924, from which arose the French teacher movement ''[[Freinet Modern School Movement|Modern School Movement]]'' ([[:fr:Mouvement de l'École Moderne|Mouvement de l'École Moderne]]). The goal of the C.E.L was to change public education from the inside with the co-operation of teachers.

Freinet's teaching methods were at variance with official policy of the National Education Board, and he resigned from it in 1935 to start his own school in [[Vence]].

== Concepts of Freinet's pedagogy ==
* Pedagogy of work (''pédagogie du travail''): pupils were encouraged to learn by making products or providing services.
* Enquiry-based learning (''tâtonnement expérimental''): group-based trial and error work.
* [[Cooperative learning]] (''travail coopératif''): pupils were to co-operate in the production process.
* Centres of interest (''complexe d'intérêt''): the children's interests and natural curiosity are starting points for a learning process
* The natural method (''méthode naturelle''): authentic learning by using real experiences of children.
* Democracy: children learn to take responsibility for their own work and for the whole community by using democratic self-government.

In 1964, Freinet drafted the ''pedagogical constants''.&lt;ref&gt;Célestin Freinet, ''Œuvres pédagogiques'', Seuil, 1994. Tome 2 : ''Les invariants pédagogiques'' (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.icem-pedagogie-freinet.org/node/18353 Bibliothèque de l'École Moderne {{n°|25}} - Les invariants pédagogiques.'' B.E.M, 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; Freinet laid out these constants to enable teachers to evaluate their class practices in relation to his basic values and thus appreciate the path that remains to be followed. "It is a new range of academic values that we would like to work here to establish, with no bias other than our preoccupation for the search for truth, in the light of experience and common sense. On the basis of these principles, which we shall regard as invariable and therefore unassailable and sure, we would like to achieve a kind of pedagogical code ... "The Pedagogical Code has several colored lights to help educators judge their psychological and pedagogical situation as teachers:
* Green light: for practices conforming to these constants, in which educators can engage without apprehension because they are assured of a comforting success.
* Red light: for practices not conforming to these constants and which must therefore be proscribed as soon as possible.
* Orange and blinking light: for practices that in certain circumstances may be beneficial but which are likely to be dangerous and toward which one must advance only cautiously in the hope of soon moving past them.

The constants cited below are only a part, a sort of summary of the pedagogical work of Celestin Freinet.
# The child is of the same nature as us [adults].
# Being bigger does not necessarily mean being above others.
# A child's academic behavior is a function of his constitution, health, and physiological state.
# No one - neither the child nor the adult - likes to be commanded by authority.
# No one likes to align oneself, because to align oneself is to obey passively an external order.
# No one likes to be forced to do a certain job, even if this work does not displease him or her particularly. It is being forced that is paralyzing.
# Everyone likes to choose their job, even if this choice is not advantageous.
# No one likes to move mindlessly, to act like a robot, that is to do acts, to bend to thoughts that are prescribed in mechanisms in which he does not participate.
# We [the teachers] need to motivate the work.
# No more [[scholasticism]].
## Everyone wants to succeed. Failure is inhibitory, destructive of progress and enthusiasm.
## It is not games that are natural to the child, but work.
# The normal path of [knowledge] acquisition is not observation, explanation and demonstration, the essential process of the School, but experimental trial and error, a natural and universal process.
# Memorization, which the School deals with in so many cases, is applicable and valuable only when it is truly in service of life.
# [Knowledge] acquisition does not take place as one sometimes believes, by the study of rules and laws, but by experience. To study these rules and laws in [language], in art, in mathematics, in science, is to place the cart before the horse.
# Intelligence is not, as scholasticism teaches, a specific faculty functioning as a closed circuit, independent of the other vital elements of the individual.
# The School only cultivates an abstract form of intelligence, which operates outside living reality, by means of words and ideas implanted by memorization.
# The child does not like to listen to an [[ex cathedra]] lesson.
# The child does not tire of doing work that is in line with his life, work which is, so to speak, functional for him.
# No one, neither child nor adult, likes control and punishment, which is always considered an attack on one's dignity, especially when exercised in public.
# Grades and rankings are always a mistake.
# Speak as little as possible.
# The child does not like the work of a herd to which the individual has to fold like a robot. He loves individual work or teamwork in a cooperative community.
# Order and discipline are needed in class.
# Punishments are always a mistake. They are humiliating for all and never achieve the desired goal. They are at best a last resort.
# The new life of the School presupposes school cooperation, that is, the management by its users, including the educator, of life and school work.
# Class overcrowding is always a pedagogical error.
# The current design of large school complexes results in the anonymity of teachers and pupils; It is, therefore, always an error and a hindrance.
# The democracy of tomorrow is being prepared by democracy at the School. An authoritarian regime at the School cannot be formative of democratic citizens.
# One can only educate in dignity. Respecting children, who must respect their masters, is one of the first conditions for the redemption of the School.
# The opposition of the pedagogical reaction, an element of the social and political reaction, is also a constant, with whom we shall have, alas! to reckon unless we are able to avoid or correct it ourselves.
# There is also a constant that justifies all our trial and error and authenticates our action: it is the optimistic hope in life.

== Legacy ==
Freinet's work lives on in the name of ''Pédagogie Freinet'', or the [[Freinet Modern School Movement]], practised in many countries worldwide.

The '''[[Freinet classification]]''' ("To organise everything") is used in the libraries of some [[elementary schools]], and was invented by Célestin Freinet&lt;ref&gt;Freinet, C. (1993) ''Education Through Work: a model for child-centered learning''; translated by John Sivell. Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press {{ISBN|0-7734-9303-4}} {{ISBN|9780773493032}}&lt;/ref&gt; to facilitate the easy finding of documents, and the use of the "[[Bibliothèque de travail]]".

The Institut universitaire de formation des maîtres (teacher training university) of [[Nice]] bears the name of Célestin Freinet.

=== Modern School Movement ===
The ''Modern School Movement'' or [[:fr:Mouvement de l'École Moderne|Mouvement de l'École Moderne]], based on the practices of the Freinets, has become an international network of educators and schools.  In 1957, the International Federation of Modern School Movements (FIMEM) was founded to organize national groups around the world.  They hold an international congress every two years to coordinate work and exchange ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fimem-freinet.org Fédération internationale des Mouvements de l’École moderne (FIMEM)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Discover Sensors''' project is an initiative of the [[Irish Government]]’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) to support the use of sensor technology in hands-on scientific investigations by Junior Certificate Science students. It is designed to provide students with an experience of "real science" in the classroom, supporting the investigative approach promoted by the revised [[Junior Certificate]] Science syllabus. DSE is managed by [[Forfás]] on behalf of the Office of Science &amp; Technology at the [[Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single9772 Article in Silicon Republic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205060423/http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single9772 |date=December 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterford-today.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1644&amp;Itemid=1&amp;ed=136 Article in Waterford Today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enn.ie/article/10123534.html Article in ENN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419061334/http://www.enn.ie/article/10123534.html |date=April 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project also has a website to support [[teachers]] and [[students]], and encourages teacher collaboration via broadband technology using the [[Moodle]] online learning support system.

Discover Sensors now has 190 participating schools throughout [[Ireland]]. If you are a Junior Certificate Science teacher, Discover Sensors can assist you by bringing new learning opportunities to your students using sensor technology.

DSE runs numerous other initiatives, including [[Science Week Ireland]], [[Discover Primary Science]], [[Greenwave]] and [[Science.ie]].

'''Donald E. Brown''' (born 1934) is an [[United States|American]] professor of [[anthropology]] ([[emeritus]]).

==Work==
He worked at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. He is best known for his theoretical work regarding the existence, characteristics and relevance of universals of human nature. In his best-known work, ''[[Human Universals]]'' (1991), he says these universals, "comprise those features of culture, society, language, behavior, and psyche for which there are no known exceptions." He is quoted at length by [[Steven Pinker]] in an appendix to ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), where Pinker cites some of the hundreds of universals listed by Brown. In area studies his doctoral research on the structure and history of Brunei was foundational.

'''Edmodo''' is an [[educational technology]] company offering [[communication|a communication]], [[collaboration]], and [[coaching]] platform to [[K-12]] schools and teachers. The Edmodo network enables teachers to share content, distribute quizzes, assignments, and manage communication with students, colleagues, and parents. Edmodo is very teacher-centric in their design and philosophy: students and parents can only join Edmodo if invited to do so by a teacher. Teachers and students spend large amounts of time on the platform, both in and out of the classroom.

==History==
Edmodo was founded by Nic Borg, Jeff O'Hara, and Crystal Hutter in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/edmodo-microblogging-platform-for-educators-merges-with-revolution-learnings-fusion-project-84022217.html/|title=Edmodo, Microblogging Platform for Educators, Merges with Revolution Learning's Fusion Project|last=|first=|date=Feb 10, 2010|website=|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.openeducation.net/2008/09/20/edmodo-free-microblogging-site-for-educators/|title=Edmodo Free Microblogging Site for Educators|date=Sep 20, 2008|website=|publisher=Open Education|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is backed by [[Index Ventures]], [[Benchmark Capital|Benchmark]], [[Greylock Partners]], Learn Capital, [[New Enterprise Associates]], Union Square Ventures, Glynn Capital Management, Tenaya Capital, SingTel Innov8, and KDDI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-08-06-edmodo-raises-30m-round-led-by-index-ventures/|title=Edmodo Raises $30M Round Led by Index Ventures|last=Wan|first=Tony|date=Aug 6, 2014|website=|publisher=EdSurge|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2017 Edmodo claimed to have over 78M users worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/edmodo/status/591766822245900289/|title=We have connected 50 million learners!|date=Apr 24, 2015|website=|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
About half of these users were in the US, with the rest being in 180 countries around the world. Significant concentrations exist in Singapore, Indonesia, Uruguay and Italy. About 10% of these users were teachers, an illustration of how popular Edmodo is in classrooms.

In 2013, Edmodo was included in the list of "The Top Apps for Teachers" by ''[[PC Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2012/industry/education#2tor | work=Fast Company | title=Back to School: The Top Apps for Teach ldvm jh oPAskojyoers|date = Aug 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Edmodo acquired a startup, Root-1, in an attempt to become the app store for education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/06/now-18m-users-strong-edmodo-makes-its-first-acquisition-in-root-1-to-become-the-app-market-for-education/|title = Now 18M Users Strong, Edmodo Makes Its First Acquisition In Root-1 To Become The App Market For Education|date = Mar 6, 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = TechCrunch|last = Empson|first = Rip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-03-05-edmodo-acquires-root-1|title = Edmodo Acquires Root-1|date = Mar 5, 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = TechCrunch|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vibhu Mittal, Co-founder and CEO of Root-1, became the CEO of Edmodo the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-12-22-exclusive-edmodo-turns-to-its-roots-for-a-new-ceo/|title = EXCLUSIVE: Edmodo Turns to Its Roots for a New CEO|date = Dec 22, 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = EdSurge|last = Wan|first = Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Edmodo launched Snapshot – a suite of assessment tools to measure student progress on educational standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://indexventures.com/news-room/blog/bringing-innovation-to-our-educational-systems-why-index-invested-in-edmodo|title = Bringing innovation to our educational systems|date = Jul 14, 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Index Ventures|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edtech digest awarded Edmodo Snapshot the Cool Tool Award for Best Assessment Solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://edtechdigest.wordpress.com/2015/03/12/2015-finalists-winners/|title = 2015 – Finalists &amp; Winners|date = Mar 15, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = edtech digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has partnered with two major publishers in United Kingdom, [[Oxford University Press]] and [[Cambridge University Press]] to provide access to educational content on the Edmodo Platform&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150121005174/en/Oxford-University-Press-Social-Learning-Platform-Edmodo#.VT3AyGR4pgQ/|title = Oxford University Press and Social Learning Platform Edmodo Partner to Enhance Pupil Learning|date = Jan 21, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Business Wire|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bring Edmodo Snapshot to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cambridge.org/about-us/news/cambridge-uk-schools-team-partner-edmodo/|title = Cambridge UK schools team partner with Edmodo|date = Jan 20, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Cambridge|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Noodle named Edmodo as one of “The 32 Most Innovative Online Educational Tools".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.noodle.com/articles/32-innovative-online-tools-to-use-in-2015/|title = The 32 Most Innovative Online Educational Tools to Use in 2015|date = Mar 15, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Noodle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Edmodo launched professional development (PD) courses for teachers in the state of New York in conjunction with NYPTI. These included both a synchronous video classroom component as well as an asynchronous, text based discussion component and have been used by thousands of teachers. In June 2017, Frost and Sullivan announced that Edmodo had won the Customer Value Leadership Award.

On May 17, 2017, Edmodo sent an email informing users that it was the victim of a major hack of user information. Some 77 million users' data were breached: this included the username, hashed password and email address (in a subset of the cases, since not all users need an email address to register). Since passwords were both hashed and salted (encrypted) using the [[bcrypt]] algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmagazine.com/millions-of-identities-stolen-from-education-platform-edmodo/article/661351/|title=Millions of identities stolen from education platform Edmodo|date=2017-05-12|last=Masters|first=Greg|publisher=SC Media|accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/hacker-steals-millions-of-user-account-details-from-education-platform-edmodo|title=Hacker Steals Millions of User Account Details from Education Platform Edmodo|date=May 11, 2017|last=Cox|first=Joseph|publisher=Motherboard|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the effort to decrypt all the passwords would have been very large. There were no reports of any school data being affected, nor any identities compromised, according to an external audit commissioned by the company.

In June 2017, Edmodo announced [https://askmo.edmodo.com/ Ask Mo], an educational video search engine, as an illustration of the benefits of machine learning on educational data sets: the search is based on videos that had been shared by teachers in the context of educational discussions and can be filtered by subject and grade level.

On April 8, 2018, Edmodo announced that it was being acquired by NetDragon for $137.5M in cash and stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=NetDragon Signs Agreement to Acquire Edmodo to Create the Largest Global Learning Community |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/netdragon-signs-agreement-to-acquire-edmodo-to-create-the-largest-global-learning-community-300626053.html |agency=PR Newswire |date=2018-04-08 |access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and organization==

===Pre-school and primary education===
[[File:E8100-Bishkek-school.jpg|thumb|A public school in [[Bishkek]]]]
Pre-school is addressed to children from 3 to 6/7 and is not compulsory.&lt;ref name="IBE"/&gt; Access to it is limited (net enrollment ratio of 10% in 2005).&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt;

Primary school usually starts at 6 or 7, lasts four years and is compulsory. Since 2007, uniforms are required in primary education. The law was pointed out as a source of  school-drop out, as the uniform has to be bought by the parents.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt; Teaching quality is sometime described as "poor":&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt; Kyrgyzstan ranked last in reading, mathematics and science at PISA 2006.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt;

===Secondary education===

Secondary education begins with the basic secondary education, which lasts four years and is compulsory.&lt;ref name="IBE"/&gt; Students have then the choice between comprehensive and vocation educations. 

Comprehensive education is constituted of a two-year curriculum, which grants — if completed — a certificate of completion ("attestat"). The certificate is generally required to join a university.&lt;ref name="EACEA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/tempus/participating_countries/overview/Kyrgyzstan.pdf | title=Higher Education in Kyrgyzstan | publisher=European Commission | date=2012 | accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vocational education is offered through three kinds of courses: A three-year course mixing vocational and general education and preparing for higher education, a two-year course mixing vocational and general education (without preparation to higher education), and a ten-month course of pure vocational education (also open to adults).&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=World+TVET+Database&amp;ct=KGZ | title=Vocational Education in Kyrgyzstan | publisher=UNESCO-UNEVOC | date=2013 | accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocational education is given in professional lyceum and vocational technical colleges.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt;

===Tertiary education===
[[File:Osh state university.jpg|thumb|Osh State University]]
Higher education includes universities, academies, specialized higher education institutes and institutes.&lt;ref name="IBE"/&gt; There are 54 tertiary education institutions: 33 public for 21 private.&lt;ref name="EACEA"/&gt; The gross enrolment rate in higher education was 12.5% in 2011/2012.&lt;ref name="EACEA"/&gt;

Universities deliver bachelor (Bakalavr) degree in four years, which allows students to pursue master (Magistr) programs, lasting two years. They also offer a "specialist degree" (specialist) in five (or six for medical and architecture studies) years. The specialist and the master degrees open the door to PhD programs (aspirantura).&lt;ref name="EACEA"/&gt;

Academies offer the same degrees in fields of scientific activity. An institute is usually a specialized branch of a university or an academy. Specialized higher education institutes are narrow profiles institutions.&lt;ref name="EACEA"/&gt; 

There were criticisms about the competency of university lecturers in Kyrgyzstan: if a Master degree is theoretically required to teach at university, most teachers actually hold a Bachelor or even no degree at all.&lt;ref name="EACEA"/&gt;

The '''Estonian Information Technology College''' (EITC) ({{lang-et|Eesti Infotehnoloogia Kolledž (EIK)}}) is a private non-profit institution of professional higher education ([[university of applied sciences]]) in [[Estonia]], located in [[Tallinn]]. EITC provides Estonian applied higher education diploma-level (at least 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation|ECTS]] credit points; equal to the [[Bachelor's degree]] under the [[Bologna process]]) education in [[information technology]] in four main programmes (IT Systems Administration, IT Systems Development, Information Systems Analysis and Technical Communication), carries out shorter-term vocational training programmes as well as various R&amp;D-oriented activities.

==Founding and History==
The governing body of the IT College, the [[Estonian Information Technology Foundation]], was established in March 2000 by the Republic of Estonia (represented by the Ministry of Education and Research), the [[University of Tartu]], the [[Tallinn University of Technology]], AS Eesti Telekom, and the [[Estonian Association of Information Technology and Telecommunications]].&lt;ref name="yhepilguga" /&gt; One of the main forces behind the formation of EITC was the rapidly growing need for IT professionals which could not be met by universities and attracted people with uneven educational and professional background.&lt;ref&gt;Pool sajandit arvutit Tartu Ülikoolis / Half a Century of Computers in the University of Tartu. Tartu Ülikool, matemaatika-informaatikateaduskond 2009. {{ISBN|978-9985-4-0585-7}} (in Estonian, with partial English translation)&lt;/ref&gt; During the first years, all students had to pay for the tuition (a small number of stipends were available for best students) - however, starting from 2007, 100 places are funded by the state, in a similar manner to state universities.&lt;ref name="ar2007"&gt;[http://www.itcollege.ee/it-kolledz/ajalugu/arhiiv/2007-2/ IT Kolledži aastaraamat 2007]. EITC website. Retrieved 2012-01-27. {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, up to 150 self-financing students are admitted every year.&lt;ref name="yhepilguga" /&gt;

The College was inaugurated by the Prime Minister [[Mart Laar]] in September 2000 and received the Estonian Award of Educational Achievement for that year. The location was in the downtown Tallinn until 2008 when the College moved into a new building in [[Mustamäe]], at the vicinity of [[Tallinn University of Technology]] and [[Tehnopol]].&lt;ref name="ar2008"&gt;[http://www.itcollege.ee/it-kolledz/ajalugu/arhiiv/2008-2/ IT Kolledži aastaraamat 2008].

'''Goldfields''' is a computer game for children which simulates 'life on the diggings' during a 19th-century gold rush. Beginning with a concept by Trevor Jacob, it was developed and published by [[Jacaranda Software]] in [[Australia]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://playitagainproject.org/games/goldfields/|title = Goldfields|date = |accessdate = 2015-01-27|website = Play it again...|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first released for [[Apple II]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gamebase64.com/game.php?id=3212&amp;d=45|title = Goldfields|date = |accessdate = 2015-01-27|website = Gamebase 64|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and IBM compatible systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first [[Macintosh]] version was later developed using [[Hypercard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/goldfields-a-simulation-of-life-on-the-diggings/oclc/222816122|title = Goldfields : a simulation of life on the diggings|date = |accessdate = 2015-01-27|website = OCLC World Cat|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Goldfields package contained a disk, teacher's guide, four black-line masters and a copy of ''A Goldfields Journal'' or ''A Guide to Prospective Gold Seekers''. A review in ''Australian Educational Computing'' magazine described it as 'a particularly useful package, adaptable to a number of levels in both upper primary and secondary social science classes.'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://acce.edu.au/sites/acce.edu.au/files/pj/journal/AEC%20Vol%201%20No%201%201986%20Software%20reviews.pdf|title = Software Reviews - Goldfields|last = |first = |date = 1986-07-01|journal = Australian Educational Computing|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also received a favourable review from the ''Australian Journal of Reading'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=469367102008934;res=IELHSS|title = Australian Journal of Reading Volume 9 Issue 4|date = 1986-11-01|accessdate = 2015-01-27|website = Informit|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its age, Goldfields remains well regarded as a mining-themed economic simulator with integrated action sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.squakenet.com/download/goldfields/893/ |title=Strategy &gt; 1990 &gt; Goldfields |date= |accessdate=2015-01-27 |website=Squakenet |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918223743/http://www.squakenet.com/download/goldfields/893/ |archivedate=2013-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its ongoing popularity with children and educators, it was rewritten from scratch for [[Windows]] XP and [[Macintosh]] OSX by [[Greygum Software]] in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.greygum.com.au/nebula/|title = Greygum Software|date = 2007-01-22|accessdate = 2015-01-27|website = Greygum Software|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; who bought the rights to the title after Jacaranda Software's closure in the early 1990s.

'''Jayanti Kalidas Patel''' (born May 24, 1925) is an Indian actor, playwright and yogi.

==Early life and education==
Dr. Jayanti Kalidas Patel was born May 24, 1925 in [[Ahmedabad]], India.  He received his BA from [[University of Mumbai]] in 1947, and was awarded a PhD for his work in [[Classical Indian musical theatre|Natya Yoga]] from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan at the Mungalal Goenka Institute in [[Mumbai]].

== Quit India Movement ==
As a young man, Patel joined [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and the [[Quit India Movement]] in protest of the [[British Raj|British rule of India]].  During one march, Patel was shot in the leg, sustaining an injury that produced a lifelong indentation and limp.

== All India Radio and "Ranglo ==
In the 1940s and 1950s, Patel portrayed the comic character "Ranglo" on All-India Radio and in subsequent stage and television productions. He took this name also for his cartooning persona, and continued to explore this character throughout his life.

== Travels and Work in the West ==
In 1967, Patel was awarded a John F. Kennedy Scholarship and traveled to the US to continue his work in Natya Yoga.  While there, he began a long association with the Ananda Ashrama in Monroe, New York and in San Francisco.

=== "Inner Broadway" ===
Traveling throughout the U.S., France, England and Germany, Patel continued to develop his work in theater as a form of yoga.

"He feels that both natya and yoga have a common purpose – to shatter the ego, to experience bliss and thereby universalize the individual transcending the limitations of time and space. Natya like any other form of an art is Yoga in Indian thought. It is a transpersonal art according to Jayanti. Instead of Ego, it takes you beyond Ego."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inner Broadway Presents Time Wrap – Yogafly Blog|url = http://yogafly.blogs.com/yogafly2/2007/08/inner-broadway-.html|website = yogafly.blogs.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works included those exploring the modern experiences of time, technology, and alienation, as well as the tools to transcend these challenges and find inner peace.

=== "Transplanation, not Translation" ===
Patel adapted several Western plays and novels for Indian audiences—including a 'transplantation" of [[George Washington Slept Here]] into "Gandhi Slept Here",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Yogi Playwright Infusing Indian Theatre With More Atma and Altruism – Magazine Web Edition &gt; July 1992 – Publications – Hinduism Today Magazine|url = http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=945|website = www.hinduismtoday.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Gujuarati-language [[Of Mice and Men (play)|Of Mice and Men]], [[Death of a Salesman]] (especially poignant as India modernized and new ways of doing business emerged), and [[Harvey (play)|Harvey]].

== Chaplin, Gandhi and Me ==
In 2015, at age 91, Patel published the book Chaplin, Gandhi and Me2, exploring the correlation between the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and Charlie Chaplin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Charlie Chaplin meets Gandhi"-Daily Metta – Metta Center|url = http://mettacenter.org/daily-metta/charlie-chaplin-meets-gandhi-daily-metta/|website = Metta Center|accessdate = 2015-12-22|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charlie Chaplin and Mr Gandhi {{!}} The Newham Story|url = http://www.newhamstory.com/node/806|website = www.newhamstory.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151121073805/http://www.newhamstory.com/node/806|archivedate = November 21, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal and Family life ==
In 1944, Dr Patel married Smt. Sharda, and together they had three children: Ms Nivedita Desai, Ms Warsha Patel, and Mr Nilesh Patel.  Dr Patel currently resides in [[Pune]] with his daughter Warsha and son Nilesh.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">'''MakeBelieve Arts''' is a [[theatre in education]] company, based in [[Corsham, Wiltshire]] and constituted as a [[social enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Eifler (ed), "Rehearsal Rooms: A place to call home", ''The Stage'', London, pp. 28-29, 7 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The company works with children aged 2–11 and their teachers, families and community. It uses theatre techniques within education to deliver creative, interactive workshops that seek to reflect, support and enhance the curriculum and to encourage [[lifelong learning]].&lt;ref name="business.timesonline.co.uk"&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/related_reports/social_entrepreneurs/article6389902.ece The Times Online], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; MakeBelieve Arts' approach is underpinned by current educational philosophy.&lt;ref name="business.timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;

MakeBelieve Arts pioneered the Helicopter Stories approach in the UK. This approach is based on the work of [[Vivian Gussin Paley]] who is patron to MakeBelieve Arts. In its simplest form Helicopter Stories involves practitioners in scribing stories dictated by children in the Early Years. These stories are then acted out around a taped out stage. In 2016 Trisha Lee published a guide on the approach. [https://www.routledge.com/Princesses-Dragons-and-Helicopter-Stories-Storytelling-and-story-acting/Lee/p/book/9781138797659 Princesses, Dragons and Helicopter Stories] 

Helicopter Stories is a registered trademark of MakeBelieve Arts.

==History==
MakeBelieve Arts was founded by Trisha Lee in 2002. The programmes in schools and the community are delivered by Trisha Lee as Artistic Director and Isla Hill as Education Director, alongside a pool of creative associates and consultants, including the author [[David Baird (author)|David Baird]].

==Educational philosophy==
MakeBelieve Arts is guided by thinking such as that of the British educationalist Sir [[Ken Robinson (British author)|Ken Robinson]], who has written that '...creativity is as important to education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/43940.Ken_Robinson Good Reads], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The company has embedded this philosophy into all its work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonsas.org.uk/arts_directory_detail.aspx?OrganisationID=371 LONSAS], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group considers that a creative approach to education allows children and young people to develop into enterprising adults with more job prospects in the future.&lt;ref name="business.timesonline.co.uk"/&gt; Trisha Lee stated in ''The Times'' that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;We aim to give the children life-long skills. The capacity to analyse, discuss and communicate. It is recognised that creativity is really important for employers in the 21st century. Once they have acquired the skills to ask questions and think outside of the box then they can do anything.&lt;ref name="business.timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Social enterprise==
MakeBelieve Arts is a [[social enterprise]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/pages/about-social-enterprise.html  Social Enterprise Coalition], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it is not core funded and derives funds from a variety of sources. Any profits are reinvested into the company.&lt;ref name="socialenterpriseambassadors.org.uk"&gt;[http://socialenterpriseambassadors.org.uk/ambassador/trisha-lee "Trisha Lee"], Social Enterprise Ambassadors, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Trisha Lee (founder and Artistic Director) was a Cabinet-appointed Social Enterprise Ambassador from mid-2007 to mid-2010.&lt;ref name="socialenterpriseambassadors.org.uk"/&gt;  With 28 other leading social entrepreneurs in the country, Trisha Lee sought to raise awareness about social enterprise and encourage other arts organisations to think creatively and become social enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialenterpriseambassadors.org.uk/about-us Social Enterprise Ambassadors], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moral Development''' focuses on the emergence, change, and understanding of [[morality]] from infancy through adulthood. Morality develops across a lifetime and is influenced by an individual's experiences and their behavior when faced with moral issues through different periods' physical and cognitive development. In short, morality concerns an individual's growing sense of what is right and wrong; it is for this reason that young children have different moral judgement and character than that of a grown adult. Morality in itself is often a synonym for "rightness" or "goodness". It refers to a certain code of conduct that is derived from one's culture, religion or personal philosophy that guides one's actions, behaviors and thoughts.  

Notions of morality development have been developed over centuries, the earliest came from philosophers like [[Confucius]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], who all took a more humanist perspective and focused on the development of the conscience and sense of virtue. In the modern day, empirical research has explored morality through a moral psychology lens by theorists like [[Sigmund Freud]] and its relation to cognitive development by theorists like [[Jean Piaget]], [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Carol Gilligan]] and Judith Smetana.  

The interest in morality spans many disciplines (e.g., [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[biology]], and [[political science]]) and specializations within psychology (e.g., [[Social psychology|social]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[Cultural psychology|cultural]]). In order to investigate how individuals understand morality, it is essential to consider their beliefs, emotions, attitudes, and behaviors that contribute to their moral understanding. Additionally, researchers in the field of moral development consider the role of peers and parents in facilitating moral development, the role of conscience and values, socialization and cultural influences, empathy and altruism, and positive development, in order to understand what factors impact morality of an individual more completely.

==Historical background and foundational theories ==
[[File:Confuscious Down Under (5022724040).jpg|thumb|

]]

'''Freud: Morality and the Superego:''' The founder of psychoanalysis, [[Sigmund Freud]], proposed the existence of a tension between the needs of society and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Eli. ''Freud, Women, and Morality: The Psychology of Good and Evil''. New York: Basic Books, 1988. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freud, moral development proceeds when the individual's selfish desires are repressed and replaced by the values of important socializing agents in one's life (for instance, one's parents).

'''B.F. Skinner's Behavioral Theory:''' A proponent of behaviorism, [[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] similarly focused on socialization as the primary force behind moral development&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Driscoll, Marcy Perkins. ''Psychology of Learning for Instruction''. Pearson, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast to Freud's notion of a struggle between internal and external forces, Skinner focused on the power of external forces (reinforcement contingencies) to shape an individual's development.

'''Piaget's Theory of Moral Development''' : While both Freud and Skinner focused on the external forces that bear on morality (parents in the case of Freud, and behavioral contingencies in the case of Skinner), [[Jean Piaget]] (1965) focused on the individual's construction, construal, and interpretation of morality from a social-cognitive and social-emotional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, Jean, Ved P. Varma, and Phillip Williams. ''Piaget, Psychology and Education: Papers in Honour of Jean Piaget''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;To understand adult morality, Piaget believed that it was necessary to study both how morality manifests in the child's world as well as the factors that contribute to the emergence of central moral concepts such as welfare, justice, and rights. Interviewing children using the Clinical Interview Method, Piaget (1965) found that young children were focused on authority mandates, and that with age children become autonomous, evaluating actions from a set of independent principles of morality. Piaget characterizes the development of morality of children through observing children while playing games to see if rules are followed.
[[File:Jean Piaget in Ann Arbor.png|thumb|212x212px|[[Jean Piaget]].]]

'''Social Domain Theory:''' Eliot Turiel  argued for a social domain approach to social cognition, delineating how individuals differentiate moral (fairness, equality, justice), societal (conventions, group functioning, traditions), and psychological (personal, individual prerogative) concepts from early in development throughout the lifespan&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, Elliot. ''The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Internet resource.&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the past 40 years, research findings have supported this model, demonstrating how children, adolescents, and adults differentiate moral rules from conventional rules, identify the personal domain as a nonregulated domain, and evaluate multifaceted (or complex) situations that involve more than one domain. This research has been conducted in a wide range of countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, U.K., U.S., Virgin Islands) and with rural and urban children, for low and high income communities, and traditional and modern cultures. Turiel's social domain theory showed that children were actually younger in developing moral standards than past psychologists predicted.

'''Kohlberg: Moral Reasoning'':''''' [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] was inspired by the works of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, Lawrence. ''The Philosophy of Moral Development: Moral Stages and the Idea of Justice''. San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1981. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the past 20 years, researchers have expanded the field of moral development, applying moral judgment, reasoning, and emotion attribution to topics such as prejudice, aggression, theory of mind, emotions, empathy, peer relationships, and parent-child interactions. The Handbook of Moral Development (2006), edited by Melanie Killen and Judith Smetana, provides a wide range of information about these topics covered in moral development today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Smetana, J.G. (Eds.) (2006). Handbook of moral development. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;One of the main objectives was to provide a sense of the current state of the field of moral development

==Cognition and intentionality==

A hallmark of moral understanding is intentionality which can be defined as an attribution of the target’s intentions towards another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Rizzo|first2=Michael T.|date=2014|title=Morality, Intentionality, and Intergroup Attitudes |journal=Behaviour|volume=151|issue=2–3|pages=337–359|doi=10.1163/1568539X-00003132 |pmc=4336952|pmid=25717199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five components make up people's concept of intentionality: an action is considered intentional if a personal has (a) a desire for an outcome, (b) a belief that the action will lead to the outcome, (c) an intention to perform the action, (d) skill to perform the action, and (e) awareness while performing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://research.clps.brown.edu/SocCogSci/Projects/intentionality.html|title=Intentionality {{!}} Malle Lab|website=research.clps.brown.edu|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research on children's [[theory of mind]], ToM, has focused on when children understand others' intentions (Wellman &amp; Lui, 2004&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., &amp; Liu, D. (2004). Scaling of theory-of-mind tasks. ''Child Development'', 75, 502-517.&lt;/ref&gt;). The moral concept of one's intentionality develops with experience in the world. Yuill (1984) presented evidence that comprehension of one's intentions plays a role in moral judgment, even in young children.&lt;ref&gt;Yuill, N. (1984). Young children's coordination of motive and outcome in judgments of satisfaction and morality. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 2, 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen, Mulvey, Richardson, Jampol, and [[Amanda Woodward|Woodward]] (2011) present evidence that with developing false belief competence (ToM), children are capable of using information about one’s intentions when making moral judgments about the acceptability of acts and punishments, recognizing that accidental transgressors, who do not hold negative intentions, should not be held accountable for negative outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Mulvey, K. L., Richardson, C., Jampol, N., &amp; Woodward, A. (2011). The accidental transgressor: Testing theory of mind and morality knowledge in young children. ''Cognition'', 119, 197-215.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, children who lacked false belief competence were more likely to attribute blame to an accidental transgressor than children with demonstrated false belief competence. In addition to evidence from a social cognitive perspective, behavioral evidence suggests that even three-year-olds have the capacity to take into account a person's intention and apply this information when responding to situations. Vaish, Carpenter, and [[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] (2010), for instance, present evidence that three-year-olds are more willing to help a neutral or helpful person than a harmful person.&lt;ref&gt;Vaish, A., Carpenter, M., &amp; Tomasello, M. (2010). Young children selectively avoid helping people with harmful intentions. ''Child Development'', 81, 1661-1669.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the ability to identify one’s intentionality, mental state understanding plays a crucial role in identifying victimization. While obvious distress cues (e.g. crying) allow even three year olds to identify victims of harm (Zelazo, Helwig, &amp; Lau, 1996&lt;ref&gt;Zelazo, P. D., Helwig, C. C., &amp; Lau, A. (1996). Intention, act, and outcome in behavioral prediction and moral judgment. ''Child Development'', 67, 2478-2492.&lt;/ref&gt;), it is not until around six years of age that children are able to appreciate that a person may be an unwilling victim of harm even in the absence of obvious distress (Shaw &amp; Wainryb, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, L. A., &amp; Wainryb, C. (2006). When victims don't cry: Children's understandings of victimization, compliance, and subversion. ''Child Development'', 77, 1050-1062.&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, Shaw and Wainryb (2006) discovered that children older than six interpret compliance, resistance, and subversion to illegitimate requests (e.g., clean my locker) from the perspective of a victim. That is, they judge that victims who resist illegitimate requests will feel better than victims who comply.

==Emotions==

Moral questions tend to be emotionally charged issues which evoke strong affective responses. Consequently, emotions likely play an important role in moral development. However, there is currently little consensus among theorists on how emotions influence moral development. [[Psychoanalytic theory]], founded by Freud, emphasizes the role of guilt in repressing primal drives. Research on [[prosocial behavior]] has focused on how emotions motivate individuals to engage in moral or altruistic acts. Social-cognitive development theories have recently begun to examine how emotions influence moral judgments. Intuitionist theorists assert that moral judgments can be reduced to immediate, instinctive emotional responses elicited by moral dilemmas.

Research on socioemotional development and prosocial development has identified several "moral emotions" which are believed to motivate moral behavior and influence moral development (Eisenberg, 2000 for a review).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N. (2000). Emotion, Regulation, and Moral Development. ''Annual Review of Psychology'', 51,665–697.&lt;/ref&gt; These moral emotions are said to be linked to moral development because they are evidence and reflective of an individual’s set of moral values, which must have undergone through the process of internalization in the first place (Kochanska &amp; Thompson, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kochanska|first=Grazyna|last2=Aksan|first2=Nazan|date=2006-12-01|title=Children's Conscience and Self-Regulation|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=1587–1618|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|issn=1467-6494}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifestation of these moral emotions can occur at two separate timings: either before or after the execution of a moral or immoral act. A moral emotion that precedes an action is referred to as an anticipatory emotion, and a moral emotion that follows an action is referred to as a consequential emotion (Tangney, Stuewig, &amp; Mashek, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tangney|first=June Price|last2=Stuewig|first2=Jeff|last3=Mashek|first3=Debra J.|date=2006-12-06|title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=58|issue=1|pages=345–372|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|issn=0066-4308|pmc=3083636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary emotions consistently linked with moral development are [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[empathy]], and [[sympathy]]. Guilt has been defined as "an agitation-based emotion or painful feeling of regret that is aroused when the actor actually causes, anticipates causing, or is associated with an aversive event" (Fergusen &amp; Stegge, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson T. J. &amp; Stegge H. (1998). Measuring guilt in children: a rose by any other name still has thorns. In Guilt and Children, ed. J Bybee, pp. 19–74. San Diego: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Shame is often used synonymously with guilt, but implies a more passive and dejected response to a perceived wrong. Guilt and shame are considered "self-conscious" emotions, because they are of primary importance to an individual's self-evaluation. Moreover, there exists a bigger difference between guilt and shame that goes beyond the type of feelings that they may provoke within an individual. This difference lies in the fact that these two moral emotions do not weigh the same in terms of their impact on moral behaviors. Studies on the effects of guilt and shame on moral behaviors has shown that guilt has a larger ability to dissuade an individual from making immoral choices whereas shame did not seem to have any deterring effect on immoral behaviors. However, it should be noted that different types of behaviors in different types of population, under different circumstances might not generate the same outcomes (Tangney, Stuewig, &amp; Mashek, 2007). In contrast to guilt and shame, empathy and sympathy are considered other-oriented moral emotions. Empathy is commonly defined as an affective response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which mirrors the other's affective state. Similarly, sympathy is defined as an emotional response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which does not mirror the other's affect, but instead causes one to express concern or sorrow for the other (Eisenberg, 2000).

The relation between moral action and moral emotions has been extensively researched. Very young children have been found to express feelings of care, and empathy towards others, showing concerns for other's well being (Eisenberg, Spinard, &amp; Sadovsky, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., Spinard, T. L., &amp; Sadovsky, A. (2006). Empathy-related responding in children. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 517-549). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has consistently demonstrated that when empathy is induced in an individual, he or she is more likely to engage in subsequent prosocial behavior (Batson 1998;&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1998). Altruism and prosocial behavior. In The Handbook of Social Psychology, ed. DT Gilbert, ST Fiske, G Lindzey, 2:282–316. Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberg, 200 for review). Additionally, other research has examined emotions of shame and guilt in relation to children's empathic and prosocial behavior (Zahn-Waxler &amp; Robinson, 1995).

While emotions serve as information for children in their interpretations about moral consequences of acts, the role of emotions in children's moral judgments has only recently been investigated. Some approaches to studying emotions in moral judgments come from the perspective that emotions are automatic intuitions that define morality (Greene, 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. (2001). An fMRI Investigation of Emotional Engagement in Moral Judgment. ''Science'', 293 (5537), 2105-2108. {{doi|10.1126/science.1062872}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt, 2001&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2001).

Other approaches place emphasis on the role of emotions as evaluative feedback that help children interpret acts and consequences (Turiel &amp; Killen, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, E., &amp; Killen, M. (2010). Taking emotions seriously: The role of emotions in moral development. In W. Arsenio &amp; E. Lemerise (Eds.), Emotions in aggression and moral development. (pp. 33-52). Washington, D.C.: APA.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown children attribute different emotional outcomes to actors involved in moral transgressions than those involved in conventional transgressions (Arsenio, 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Arsenio, W. F. (1988). Children's conceptions of the situational affective consequences of sociomoral events. ''Child Development'', 59, 1611-1622.&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenio &amp; Fleiss, 1996&lt;ref&gt;Arsenio, W.

==Role of interpersonal, intergroup, and cultural influences==
Children's interactions and experiences with caregivers and peers have been shown to influence their development of moral understanding and behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/early-childhood-moral-development/|title=Early Childhood Moral Development|website=www.mentalhelp.net|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;Researchers have addressed the influence of interpersonal interactions on children's moral development from two primary perspectives: Socialization/Internalization (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994;&lt;ref&gt;Grusec, J. E., &amp; Goodnow, J. J. (1994). Impact of parental discipline methods on the child's internalization of values: A reconceptualization of current points of view.

Moral development and moral education: An overview.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research from the social domain theory perspective focuses on how children actively distinguish moral from conventional behavior based in part on the responses of parents, teachers, and peers.&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1997). Parenting and the development of social knowledge reconceptualized: A social domain analysis. In J. E. Grusec &amp; L. Kuczynski (Eds.), Parenting and the internalization of values (pp. 162-192). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Social domain suggests that there are different areas of reasoning co-existing in development those include societal (concerns about conventions and grouping), moral (fairness, justice and rights) and psychological (concerns with personal goals and identity).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Turiel|first=E|date=2007|chapter=The Development of Morality |editors=W. Damon, R. M. Lerner and N.

In contrast, adults are more likely to respond to children's conventional misdeeds (e.g. wearing a hat in the classroom, eating spaghetti with fingers) by reminding children about specific rules and doing so only in certain contexts (e.g. at school but not at home).&lt;ref name=Smetana1984&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1984). Toddlers' social interactions regarding moral and conventional transgressions. ''Child Development'', 55, 1767-1776.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1985). Preschool children's conceptions of transgressions: Effects of varying moral and conventional domain-related attributes. ''Developmental Psychology'', 21, 18-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Peers respond mainly to moral but not conventional transgressions and demonstrate emotional distress (e.g. crying or yelling) when they are the victim of moral but unconventional transgressions.&lt;ref name=Smetana1984/&gt; 

Research from a socialization/internalization perspective focuses on the ways in which adults pass down standards or rules of behavior to children through parenting techniques and why children do or do not internalize those values (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994; Kochanska &amp; Askan, 1995). From this perspective, moral development involves children's increasing compliance with and internalization of adult rules, requests, and standards of behavior. Using these definitions, researchers find that parenting behaviors vary in the extent to which they encourage children's internalization of values, and that these effects depend partially on a child attributes, such as age and [[temperament]] (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994). For instance, Kochanska (1997) showed that gentle parental discipline best promotes conscience development in temperamentally fearful children but that parental responsiveness and a mutually responsive parent-child orientation best promote conscience development in temperamentally fearless children.&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G. (1997). Multiple pathways to conscience for children with different temperaments: From toddlerhood to age 5. ''Developmental Psychology'', 33, 228-240.&lt;/ref&gt; These parental influences exert their effects through multiple pathways, including increasing children's experience of moral emotions (e.g. guilt, empathy) and their self-identification as moral individuals (Kochanska, 2010&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G., Koenig, J. L., Barry, R. A., Kim, S., &amp; Yoon, J. E. (2010). Children's conscience during toddler and preschool years, moral self, and a competent, adaptive developmental trajectory. ''Developmental Psychology'', 46, 1320-1332&lt;/ref&gt;). Development can be divided up to multiple stages however the first few years of development is usually seen to be formed by 5 years of age. According to Freud's research, relationships between a child and parents early on usually provides the basis forth personality development as well as the formation of morality. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Freud|first=S|date=1930-1961|title=Civilization and its Discontents|url=|location=New York, NY|volume=|pages=|publisher=W. W. Norton.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers interested in intergroup attitudes and behavior related to ones moral development have approached the study of [[stereotypes]], [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] in children and adolescents from several theoretical perspectives. Some, however not limited to are of these theoretical frameworks: Cognitive Development Theory (Aboud, 1988);&lt;ref&gt;Aboud, F. E. (1988). Children and prejudice. Oxford, England: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Social Domain Theory (Killen &amp; Rutland, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Rutland, A. (2011). Children and social exclusion: Morality, prejudice, and group identity. NY: Wiley/Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen, Sinno, &amp; Margie, 2007&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Sinno, S., &amp; Margie, N.

A new social-cognitive developmental perspective on prejudice: The interplay between morality and group identity. ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', 5, 280-291.&lt;/ref&gt;); Implicit Theories (Levy, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S. R., Chiu, C. Y., &amp; Hong, Y. Y. (2006). Lay theories and intergroup relations. Group Processes and Intergroup Relations., 9, 5-24&lt;/ref&gt; and Intergroup-contact Theory (Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, T. F., &amp; Tropp, L. R. (2008). How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice? Meta-analytic tests of three mediators. ''European Journal of Social Psychology'', 38, 922-934. {{doi|10.1002/ejsp.504}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plethora of research approaches is not surprising given the multitude of variables, (e.g. group identity, group status, group threat, group [[Norm (social)|norms]], [[Contact hypothesis|intergroup contact]], individual beliefs and context) that need to be considered when assessing children's intergroup attitudes. While most of this research has investigated two-dimensional relationships between each of the three components: stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination (e.g., role of stereotypes in intergroup prejudice, use of stereotypes to reason about intergroup discrimination, how prejudices manifest into discrimination), very few have addressed all three aspects of intergroup attitudes and behaviors together (McKown, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;McKown, C. (2004). Age and ethnic variation in children's thinking about the nature of racism. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 25, 597-617. {{doi|10.1016/j.appdev.2004.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developmental intergroup research, stereotypes are defined as judgments made about an individual's attributes based on group membership (Killen, Margie, &amp; Sinno, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Margie, N. G., &amp; Sinno, S. (2006). Morality in the context of intergroup relationships. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 155-183). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen et al., 2007). These judgments are more complex than regular judgments as they require one to recognize and understand (eg. gender, race, religion, culture, nationality, ethnicity) which group one individual belongs to as they might be treated differently delliberately because of the group they are associated with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social psychologists focus on stereotypes as a cognitive component influencing intergroup behaviors and tend to define them as being fixed concepts associated with a category (Allport, 1954).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). The nature of prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; Prejudice, on the other hand is defined in terms of negative attitudes or affective expressions toward a whole group or members of a group (Stangor, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Stangor, C. (2009). The study of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination within social psychology: A quick history of theory and research. In T. D. Nelson (Ed.), Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. (pp. 1-22). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative stereotypes and prejudices can manifest into discrimination towards an outgroup and for children and adolescents, this may come in the form of exclusion from peer groups as well as the wider community (Killen &amp; Rutland, 2011). Such actions can negatively impact a child in the long term in the sense of weakening ones confidence, self esteem as well personal identity. 

One explicit manner in which societies can socialize individuals is through moral education. Solomon and colleagues (1988) present evidence from a study that integrated both direct instruction and guided reflection approaches to moral development, with evidence for resultant increases in spontaneous prosocial behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, D., Watson, M. S., Delucchi, K. L., Schaps, E., &amp; Battistich, V. (1988). Enhancing children's prosocial behavior in the classroom. American Educational Research Journal, 25, 527-554.&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture can also be a key contributor toward differences in morality within society.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosocial behavior, which is behavior that benefits others, is much more likely in societies with strong social goals rather than societies which emphasize the individual. For example, children being raised in China eventually adopt the collective communist ideals of their society. In fact, children learn to lie and deny responsibility for accomplishing something good instead of seeking recognition for their actions.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development" /&gt; Early indications of prosocial behavior include the sharing of toys and comforting distressed friends, and these characteristics can be seen in an individual’s behavior as young as infancy and toddlerhood.  Starting in preschool, sharing, helping, and other prosocial behaviors become more common, particularly in females, although the gender differences in prosocial behavior are not evident in all social contexts.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral relativism ===
[[Moral relativism]], also called “cultural relativism,” suggests that morality is relative to each culture. One cannot rightly pass moral judgement on members of other cultures except by their own cultural standards when actions violate a moral principle, which may differ from one’s own. [[Richard Shweder|Shweder]], Mahapatra, and Miller (1987) argued for the notion that different cultures defined the boundaries of morality differently.&lt;ref&gt;Shweder, R. A., Mahapatra, M., &amp; Miller, J. G. (1987). Culture and moral development In J. Kagan &amp; S. Lamb (Eds.), The emergence of morality in young children. (pp.1-83). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also different from [[moral subjectivism]] which refers to the view that moral truth is relative to the individual. Moral relativism can be identified as a form of [[moral skepticism]] and is often misidentified as [[moral pluralism]]. It opposes to the attitude of moral superiority and ethnocentrism found in [[moral absolutism]] and the views of [[moral universalism]]. Turiel and Perkins (2004) argued for the universality of morality, focusing largely on evidence throughout history of resistance movements that fight for justice through the affirmation of individual self-determination rights.&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, E. &amp; Perkins, S. A. (2004). Flexibilities of mind: Conflict and culture. Human Development, 47, 158-178.&lt;/ref&gt;Miller (2006) proposes that there is cultural variability in the priority given to moral considerations (e.g., the importance of prosocial helping).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. G. (2006). Insights into moral development from cultural psychology. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 375-398). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than variability in what individuals consider moral (fairness, justice, rights). Wainryb (2006), in contrast, demonstrates that children in diverse cultures such as the U.S., India, China, Turkey, and Brazil share a pervasive view about upholding fairness and the wrongfulness of inflicting armong others.&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (2006). Moral development in culture: Diversity, tolerance, and justice. In M. Killen &amp; J.G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of Moral Development (pp. 211-242). NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultures vary in terms of conventions and customs, but not principles of fairness, which appear to emerge very early in development, prior to socialization influences. Wainryb (1991; 1993) shows that many apparent cultural differences in moral judgments are actually due to different informational assumptions, or beliefs about the way the world works.&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (1991). Understanding differences in moral judgments: The role of informational assumptions. ''Child Development'', 62, 840-851.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (1993). The application of moral judgments to other cultures: Relativism and universality. ''Child Development'', 64, 924-933.&lt;/ref&gt;  When people hold different beliefs about the effects of actions or the status of different groups of people, their judgments about the harmfulness or fairness of behaviors often differ, even when they are applying the same moral principles. 

=== Religion ===
The role of religion in a culture may influence a child's moral development and sense of moral identity. Values are transmitted through [[religion]], which is for many inextricably linked to a cultural identity. [[Religious development]] often goes along with moral development of the children as it shapes the child's concepts of right and wrong. Intrinsic aspects of religion may have a positive impact on the internalization and the symbolism of moral identity. The child may internalize the parents' morals if a religion is a family activity or the religious social group's morals to which the child belongs. Religious development mirrors the cognitive and moral developmental stages of the children. Nucci and Turiel (1993), on the other hand, proposed that the development of morality is distinct from the understanding of religious rules when assessing individuals' reactions to whether moral and nonmoral religious rules was contingent to God's word and whether a harmful act could be justified as morally right based on God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Nucci, L. P., &amp; Turiel, E. (1993). God's word, religious rules and their relation to Christian and Jewish children's concepts of morality. ''Child Development'', 64, 1485-1491.&lt;/ref&gt; Children form their own understanding of how they see the world, themselves or others and are able to understand that not all religious rules are applied to morality, social structures or different religions. 

===In indigenous American communities===

In [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American communities]], morality is taught to children through [[storytelling]]. It provides children guidelines for understanding the core values of their community, the significance of life and ideologies of moral character from past generations. &lt;ref name="Howard 1999 45–53"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=Scott J.|title=Contemporary American Indian storytelling: An outsider's perspective|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=1999|volume=23|pages=45–53|doi=10.2307/1185925|jstor=1185925}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Storytelling]] shapes the minds of young children in these communities as well as forms the dominant means for understanding and the basic foundation for learning and teaching.  

[[Storytelling]] in everyday life is used as an [[Informal learning|indirect form of teaching]]. Stories embedded with lessons of morals, ideals, and ethics are told alongside daily household chores. Most children in Indigenous American communities develop a sense of keen [[attention]] to the details of a story with the goal of learning from them, and to understand why people do the things they do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaskins|first=Suzanne|title=Open Attention as a Cultural Tool for Observational Learning|url=http://kellogg.nd.edu/learning/Gaskins.pdf|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding gained from a child's observation of morality and ethics taught through storytelling allows them to participate within their community appropriately.

Specific animals are used as characters to symbolize specific values and views of the culture in the [[storytelling]] where listeners are taught through the actions of these characters. In the [[Lakota tribe]], coyotes are often viewed as a trickster character, demonstrating negative behaviors like greed, recklessness, and arrogance &lt;ref name="Howard 1999 45–53"/&gt; while bears and foxes are usually viewed as wise, noble, and morally upright characters from which children learn to model .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/legends.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stories, trickster characters often get into troubles, thus teaching children to avoid exhibiting similar negative behaviors. The reuse of characters calls for a more predictable outcome that children can more easily understand.

===Social exclusion===

Intergroup exclusion context provides an appropriate platform to investigate the interplay of these three dimensions of intergroup attitudes and behaviors, prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. Developmental scientists working from a Social Domain Theory (SDT: Killen et al., 2006; Smetana, 2006) perspective have focused on methods that measure children's reasoning about exclusion scenarios. This approach has been helpful in distinguishing which concerns children attend to when presented with a situation in which exclusion occurs. Exclusion from a peer group could raise concerns about moral issues (e.g. fairness and empathy towards excluded), social-conventional issues (e.g., traditions and social norms set by institutions and groups) and personal issues (e.g., autonomy, individual preferences related to friendships), and these can coexist depending on the context in which the exclusion occurs. In intergroup as well as intragroup contexts, children need to draw on knowledge and attitudes related to their own social identities, other social categories, the social norms associated with these categories as well as moral principals about the welfare of the excluded, and fair treatment, to make judgments about social exclusion. The importance of morality arises when the evaluation process of social exclusion requires one to deal with not only the predisposed tendencies of discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes and bias but also the internal judgments about justice equality and individual rights, which may prove to be a very complex task since it often evokes conflicts and dilemmas coming from the fact that the components of the first often challenge the components of the latter (Killen, Lee-Kim, McGlothlin, &amp; Stangor, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Lee-Kim|first2=Jennie|last3=McGlothlin|first3=Heidi|last4=Stangor|first4=Charles|last5=Helwig|first5=Charles C.|date=2002|title=How Children and Adolescents Evaluate Gender and Racial Exclusion|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=67|issue=4|pages=i–129|jstor=3181568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings from a Social Domain Theory perspective show that children are sensitive to the context of exclusion and pay attention to different variables when judging or evaluating exclusion. These variables include, social categories, the stereotypes associated with them, children's qualifications as defined by prior experience with an activity, personality and behavioral traits that might be disruptive for group functioning and conformity to conventions as defined by group identity or social consensus. In the absence of information, stereotypes can be used to justify exclusion of a member of an out-group (Horn 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Horn, S. S. (2003). Adolescents' reasoning about exclusion from social groups. ''Developmental Psychology'', 39, 71-84&lt;/ref&gt; Killen and Stangor, 2001&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Stangor, C. (2001). Children's social reasoning about inclusion and exclusion in gender and race peer group contexts. ''Child Development'', 72, 174-186&lt;/ref&gt;). One's personality traits and whether he or she conforms to socially accepted behaviors related to identity also provide further criteria for social acceptance and inclusion by peers (Killen, Crystal, &amp; Watanabe, 2002;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Crystal, D. S., &amp; Watanabe, H. (2002). The individual and the group: Japanese and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion, tolerance of difference, and prescriptions for conformity. ''Child Development'', 73, 1788-1802&lt;/ref&gt; Park, Killen, Crystal, &amp; Watanabe, 2003&lt;ref&gt;Park, Y., Killen, M., Crystal, D., &amp; Watanabe, H. (2003). Korean, Japanese, and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion: Evidence for diversity. International Journal of Behavioral Development, 27, 555-565&lt;/ref&gt;). Also, research has documented the presence of a transition occurring at the reasoning level behind the criteria of inclusion and exclusion from childhood to adolescence (Horn, 2003). As children get older, they become more attuned to issues of group functioning and conventions and weigh them in congruence with issues of fairness and morality (Killen &amp; Stangor, 2001)

===Allocation of resources===

[[Resource allocation]] is a critical part of the [[decision making process]] for individuals in positions of public responsibility and authority (e.g., health care providers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=71–4|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmid=8083876|pmc=1376429}}&lt;/ref&gt; When resources become scarce, such as in rural communities experiencing situations when there is not enough food to feed everyone, authorities in position to make decisions that affect this community can create conflicts on various levels (e.g., personally, financially, socially, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.,|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.,|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moral conflict that arise from these decisions can be divided into a focus of conflict and a locus of moral conflict. The locus, or the place where conflict occurs, can develop from multiple sources which include “any combination of personal, professional, organizational, and community values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.,|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.,|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of conflict occurs from competing values held by stakeholders and financial investors. As K. C. Calman (1994) stated in regards to the reallocation of resources in a medical setting, resources must be thought of not only as money, but also in the form of skills, time, and faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=72–73|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmc=1376429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The healthcare system has many examples where morality and resource allocation has ongoing conflicts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3030">The '''Olympic Primary School''' is a government-run [[primary school]] in [[Kenya]]. It is located in [[Kibera]], a slum district in the capital [[Nairobi]]. The school was established in 1980. Over the ensuing years the school was successful in national examinations and thus attracted pupils from all social classes, from millionaires families, middle-classes, working classes and the penniless slum dwellers.   

The school is partly funded by the British government and consistently places near the top of Kenya's school league tables. It received a visit from British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] in January, 2005. The aim of the visit was to learn about the effects of the 2003 introduction of free primary schooling. 

There were some 1,700 students at the school prior to 2003. Some 5000 students attempted to enroll at the time that school fees were abolished, but not all could be accommodated. In 2005, enrollment was approximately 2,200. Last year, in 2015, enrollment was 1780 boys and 1787 girls for a total of 3567 students, approximately evenly divided across all 8 class levels. 

In January, 2016, enrollment was 1983 boys and 2063 girls, for a total of 4046 students. Now, in March, we have increased to 4125 students.

On Thursday, March 24, 2016, we inaugurated 20 new classrooms, bringing us to 45 classrooms.  We still stand at almost 100 students per classroom.

Our performance on the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examinations in November have improved each year for the last five years. This year, we reached a new record of 420 students sitting the exam, and a new high average score over the past five years of 295.14.

 |ShortSummary=George Mottershead lives in the flat above his father Albert's grocery shop with his wife Lizzie and their daughters Muriel and June. He suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] following his time in the army during [[World War I]], but his mother Lucy is frustrated that George still lives with them and wants him and his family to move out. The family become concerned for George's mental state when he visits the local dockyard's quarantine office and purchases a [[squirrel monkey]] and an [[eclectus parrot]] which were about to be euthanised. George promises to sell the animals to a circus, but ends up buying an old [[Bactrian camel]] which the circus' ringmaster planned to slaughter. The three animals are kept in the family's small backyard, and while the neighbours are willing to pay to see them, the grocery shop gets fewer customers.

Driving through [[Upton by Chester]] on his way to an army reunion, George sees the run-down [[Oakfield Manor]], which is up for auction. Inspired by a conversation about wildlife with Lady Katherine Longmore, he plans to convert the Oakfield estate into a zoo where animals would not be behind bars. While the family are initially sceptical and Lucy is completely against the idea, George gets a £3,000 loan from the bank. At the auction, the Mottersheads win Oakfield Manor for £3,500, but Albert has to sell his shop and the family home for the additional £500. The Mottersheads move into the Manor, and agree to keep their plans a secret from the people of Upton for the first few months. However, the squirrel monkey (which June names "Mortimer") breaks out of his cage and wanders into a shop, frightening the shopkeeper and arousing suspicion among the community.

 |ShortSummary=The Mottershead family struggle to adjust to their new life, while George continues to develop the zoo (which he names "[[Chester Zoo]]") and acquires more animals, including two goats, a pelican and several small birds for an aviary. He visits [[Matlock, Derbyshire]], where the owner of a [[pleasure garden]] offers to sell him two [[Asian black bear]]s, but when George tells the family about the offer, Lizzie, Muriel and Lucy refuse to let him bring them to the Manor. Despite this, George still returns to Matlock to collect the bears, accompanied by Lizzie's brother Billy Atkinson. While he is away, Lizzie visits Chester Council and tries to file for planning permission to build the zoo, while also making changes to George's plans for the zoo's layout.

In Upton, the community start to gossip about the Mottersheads due to their secretive behaviour, and local reverend Aaron Webb suspects illegal activity. When June starts school, Webb convinces her to tell him about her family, and she goes on a tangent about the various animals they own, including the camel and the bears. Webb then goes to the Chester Council and encourages councilman Ronald Tipping to have the zoo shut down before it is completed.

 |ShortSummary=As word spreads about the zoo, the Mottershead family are met with harsh backlash from the people of Upton, who are strongly opposed to the idea and start a campaign to prevent the zoo from opening. However, George is undeterred by the criticisms and appears at a town meeting to promote the zoo, but the villagers are unconvinced and the Mottersheads gain a bad reputation in the village, leading to June being bullied at school. Despite this, George writes a letter to Chester Council detailing their plans and starts digging a trench to surround the bear enclosure, while Albert and Muriel complete an aviary built around an old gazebo and transfer all the small birds into it. Local shopkeeper Mrs Radler visits Katherine Longmore and tries to convince her to side with Upton in the debate, but Katherine disregards her and continues to show support for the Mottersheads. At Chester Council, Ronald Tipping receives George's letter, but decides not to read it.

Newspaper journalist Tim Gascoigne visits Oakfield Manor to interview the Mottersheads about the zoo, but he takes their words out of context and publishes a negative article slandering their venture. Billy drives into Upton with a flock of [[Humboldt penguin]]s he acquired for the zoo, but his van breaks down in the middle of town, so he and George lead the penguins to Oakfield on foot. The villagers are entertained by this and follow them, and when they arrive Albert strikes a water pipe to flood the trench, converting it into a pool for the penguins. That night, the Mottersheads celebrate the newly-gained support and George appoints Muriel as deputy zookeeper. Outside, while no one notices, one of the black bears becomes agitated and frees itself from their enclosure.

 |ShortSummary=Discovering that one of the bears has escaped, George heads out to look for it. He finds the bear in a nearby forest, but the arrival of Billy's van scares it and it scratches George's arm. While he and Billy successfully get the bear back to Oakfield, George realises the zoo needs more money to make the enclosures more secure, and the next day he requests a £300 loan from the bank, but is refused. At the bank, George meets aristocrat Lady Goodwin, who takes a liking to Mortimer the squirrel monkey. She visits Oakfield to see Mortimer again, and George suggests she pay the Mottersheads a small amount of money per month to "adopt" the monkey. Meanwhile, Mrs Radler and Reverend Webb organise a petition to get the zoo closed.

George's wounded arm becomes infected, leaving him bedridden for several days. Frankie, a receptionist from Chester Council, gives the Mottersheads a [[carpet python]] which had been abandoned outside the council building. Lizzie finds out that Katherine Longmore has opened an account at the local shop to give the Mottersheads financial support, which gives George the idea to organise a fundraising benefit. Katherine agrees for the benefit to be hosted in her mansion, and Lady Goodwin invites several of her aristocratic friends. At the event, the Mottersheads display several of their animals and hold an auction of charitable adoptions. The python escapes from its basket and goes missing, so Billy and Frankie try to catch it without the guests finding out. The benefit is a success, with the Mottersheads raising £320 in donations, while June and Albert catch the python. However, Reverend Webb tells George that Chester Council has refused planning permission for the Mottersheads to build the zoo.

 |ShortSummary=The Mottersheads are left devastated by the news that planning permission for the zoo has been denied. To keep up with their debts, George and Lizzie sell one of the black bears to [[Belle Vue Zoological Gardens|Belle Vue Zoo]]. Lucy notices the other bear acting strangely and realises it is pregnant. A land agent offers to buy Oakfield Manor for the same amount the Mottersheads bought it for, but George turns him away. At Chester Council, Frankie takes a copy of the Upton petition from Ronald Tipping's desk and has Billy take it to George. Reading through the reasons listed in the petition, George learns that Mrs Radler manipulated the villagers into making up false reasons for the zoo to be closed. He goes to Chester Council and confronts Tipping about the corruption, and while Tipping confidently disregards him, Frankie explains that the Mottersheads can legally appeal against the council's decision.

George contacts the Ministry of Health to request an appeal, but is told there is a long waiting list and it could take several months for their appeal to be read. Katherine reveals that her nephew, Aldous Whittlington-Smith, works closely with health minister Sir Arthur Addison, and she and George travel to London to see Sir Arthur and tell him about their appeal. Reverend Webb tries to convince Lizzie to leave Oakfield and offers to move her family into a nearby cottage, but she mentions the land agent's offer and explains it wouldn't be enough to cover the family's debts. When the agent returns with a higher offer, Lizzie realises Webb has been sending him. She confronts Webb, whose late wife's family originally owned Oakfield, but he defends himself by saying George's ambitions will lead the family into poverty. In London, George and Katherine talk to Arthur at an opera, and discuss their plans for the zoo and their appeal against Chester Council. While Arthur is interested, he does not guarantee the appeal will be successful. When George returns to Upton, he finds the family gathered around the bear, which has given birth to two cubs. The family later receive a letter from Arthur, approving a public hearing to decide the zoo's planning application. Tipping conspires with Webb to make George look bad at the hearing.

 |ShortSummary=Albert discovers that the zoo's aviary has been vandalised in the night, and all its birds have flown away. George and Lizzie have a meeting with lawyer Neville Kelly, hoping for him to represent the Mottersheads in the upcoming hearing. Kelly during that meeting, if the telephone rang, picks up the receiver and puts it back at once to stop the ringing, instead of having a secretary to answer the telephone while Kelly is busy; that does not bode well to George for his chances of later contacting Kelly by telephone. However, Kelly's demeanour annoys George so much that he decides to represent the family himself. As the hearing draws closer, George spends many hours researching legal information and becomes more hostile and aggressive towards the rest of the family. June invites her school friend Barbara around to Oakfield and they play hide and seek, but when George catches Barbara in his study he is outraged and sends her home. Katherine agrees to be a character reference for the Mottersheads at the hearing. Realising George's short temper may work against them, Lizzie goes back to Kelly and asks him to be their lawyer, and he accepts. When George learns of this on the day of the hearing, he leaves and sits outside while the hearing takes place.

While Tipping, Reverend Webb and Mrs Radler give strong evidence against the Mottersheads, Katherine praises the family and Kelly exposes the lies in Upton's petition. Frankie tells Billy that Tipping did not read George's letter about the zoo, and urges him to tell George. Muriel convinces George to be present at the hearing, and when he returns Billy tells him about the unread letter. Due to the even divide between oppositions, health minister Joseph Keene concludes that the fate of the appeal will be decided after an inspection of the zoo itself. Once the hearing ends, Tipping dismisses Frankie for her betrayal. The next day, Keene visits Oakfield Manor and inspects each animal enclosure, but despite George's urging he does not make a decision that day. Barbara finds two [[lovebird]]s from the vandalised aviary in her garden and returns them to Oakfield. A few days after the inspection, the Mottersheads receive a letter from the Ministry of Health approving for Chester Zoo to be opened. The family continue development ahead of their opening, and despite promising in the hearing that the zoo would have no dangerous animals, George acquires a lion.

Dumas was the first Black woman to serve as a dean at the [[University of Michigan]]. She served as deputy director of the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], becoming the first nurse, female, or African-American to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/faculty-history/faculty/rhetaugh-graves-dumas/memoir|title=Memoir {{!}} Faculty History Project|website=www.lib.umich.edu|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is said to have been the first nurse to use the scientific method to conduct experiments that evaluated nursing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpnas.org/aahp/biographies/rhetaugh-graves-dumas.html|title=Rhetaugh Graves Dumas|website=www.cpnas.org|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Life and Education==
Rhetaugh Etheldra Graves was born in [[Natchez, Mississippi]]. Dumas' mother had wanted to become a nurse, but no local nursing schools admitted African-American students at the time and her family could not afford to send her to college further away.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/27/AR2007072700332.html|title=Rhetaugh Dumas, 78; Nurse Rose To Become NIMH Deputy Director|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|date=2007-07-27|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Dumas spoke at the Columbia University 2003 commencement for health sciences graduates, she said "From infancy, I was told that when I grew up, I was going to be a nurse, not just an ordinary nurse, mind you, but one who would be admired by people all around the country -- not only for her personal achievements, but more importantly, for her contributions toward improving the welfare of others."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

She obtained her nursing degree at Dillard University in New Orleans in 1951.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/faculty-history/faculty/rhetaugh-graves-dumas/memoir|title=Memoir {{!}} Faculty History Project|website=www.lib.umich.edu|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following graduation, she took her first jobs as a substitute teacher in Natchez&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and as the Nurse Director of Dillard University’s Student Health Center.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dumas died of cancer in a Houston hospice on July 22, 2007.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/27/AR2007072700332.html|title=Rhetaugh Dumas, 78; Nurse Rose To Become NIMH Deputy Director|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|date=July 27, 2007|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Dumas earned a master's degree in nursing in 1961 from [[Yale University]] and joined the school's faculty, ultimately becoming an associate professor and the chair of psychiatric nursing.&lt;ref name=Post/&gt; While at Yale, she served as a member of the Board of Public School Education in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and helped mental health professionals get involved with parents and students during the school riots of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She worked simultaneously as Director of Nursing at the Connecticut Mental Health Center and as Chair of the Yale Department of Psychiatric Nursing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, Dumas held leadership positions with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]]. She was the chief of the organization's Psychiatric Nursing Education Branch.&lt;ref name="Award" /&gt; Between 1979 and 1981, she was the first nurse, female, or African-American to serve as the deputy director of the NIMH.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Award" /&gt; In 1979 she was appointed by Patricia Roberts Harris, secretary of Health and Human Services, to the position of deputy director.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During her time at the NIMH, according to her obituary in Nursing Outlook, she "played a major role in redirecting professional training to meet the needs of the unserved and underserved, a policy focus that continues to this day."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While at NIMH, Dumas earned a doctoral degree from [[Union Institute &amp; University|Union Institute]].&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;  

Dumas worked for the University of Michigan for over 20 years, and she served three terms there as the nursing school dean. Dumas was the first Black female dean at Michigan, but left the position when she was appointed Vice Provost for Health and the Lucille Cole Professor of Nursing.&lt;ref name="Award" /&gt;

Dumas served terms as president of the [[American Academy of Nursing]] and the [[National League for Nursing]]. She was a member of the [[Institute of Medicine]] and a fellow of the A.K.

His example evoked a deep awareness of God's loving presence in all with whom he came in contact. He awakened within them consciousness of their dignity as children of God. He invited his followers to share his Gospel insight, and empowered them to reach out to the needy, especially the materially poor. The life of blessed Edmund Rice - businessman, husband, father, widower, religious brother, teacher and founder - challenges all involved in Christian Brother Education to live and teach Gospel values in today's world. His charisma inspired the essential elements of a Christian Brother Education.

The S.M.A. compound consists of two main buildings, the Old Wing, and the New Wing (Brother Germain Wing). The Principal's office is located on the bottom floor of the Old Wing, and there are two staff rooms, one on the Old Wing, and another on the New Wing.
 
The Old Wing has only two floors. It is the main building of the school. On the bottom floor is the principal's office, the room's 101 to 105 and an old lab which is used for building technology. On the top floor is the staff room, then rooms 201 to 206. (All rooms respective from right to left.)

The New Wing is the latest addition to the compound. It was built in 1998, and was named after a past principal, Bro. Germain. The New Wing has three floors. The bottom floor has a library, the councilor's office, and a science lab. On the second floor is the lowest level class-room, WA5. Next, the New Staff-Room, then the computer lab. On the third floor is WA1, WA2, WA3, and WA4. (All rooms are respective from left to right.)

'''Sexism in academia''' refers to the [[discrimination]] and [[hierarchy|subordination]] of a particular sex in academic institutions, particularly [[university|universities]], due to the ideologies, practices and reinforcements that privilege one sex over another. Sexism in academia is not limited to but primarily affects women who are denied the professional achievements awarded to men in their respective fields such as positions, tenure and awards.&lt;ref name=":02" Sexism in academia encompasses institutionalized and cultural sexist ideologies; it is not limited to the admission process and the under-representation of women in the sciences but also includes the denial of [[tenure]], positions and awards that are generally accorded to men.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savigny|first=Heather|year=2014|title=Women, know your limits: cultural sexism in academia|url=https://search-ebscohost-com.echo.louisville.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=eric&amp;AN=EJ1046728&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Gender &amp; Education|volume=26|pages=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==
There is controversy over whether women's under-representation in specific academic fields is the result of [[gender discrimination]] or of other factors such as personal inclination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird|first=Sharon|date=March 2011|title=Unsettling Universities' Incongruous, Gendered Bureaucratic Structures: A Case-study Approach|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|volume=18|issue=2|pages=202–230|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2009.00510.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The blank slate : the denial of human nature in modern intellectual life|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|date=2002|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0-670-03151-1|edition=|location=New York|pages=ch 18|ref=blankslate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals have argued that there are equal opportunities for women and men in sciences and that sexism no longer exists in these fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110207/full/470153a.html|title=Science gender gap probed|journal=Nature|volume=470|issue=7333|pages=153|last=Dickey|first=Z|access-date=|doi=10.1038/470153a|pmid=21307907|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/equal-prospects-for-both-sexes-in-science-1.10053|title=Equal prospects for both sexes in science|journal=Nature|last=Gilbert|first=N|access-date=|doi=10.1038/nature.2012.10053|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers note that as of 2015, women had closed the undergraduate degree gap for several STEM fields including both the social and biological sciences, but women only accounted for approximately 20% of the computer science and engineering undergraduate degree holders. Likewise, at the master's and doctoral level, the number of STEM degrees obtained by women had increased for many fields; however, only 27% of the master's degrees and 23% of the doctoral degrees in computer science and engineering were held by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://research.swe.org/2016/08/degree-attainment/|title=Degree Attainment - Research and Trends for Women in STEM|date=2016-08-17|work=Research and Trends for Women in STEM|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims of equal opportunity in scientific fields of academia are often attributed to women's "preference" and inclination for other fields of study and to teaching instead of research. However, such claims do not take into account that gender is central to the organization of [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This might explain women's under-representation in academia at more senior levels, and the way in which the organization of higher education institutions might be structurally disadvantaging women by the institutionalization, practice, and valuing of masculinity which ends up reinforcing hegemonic masculinities.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolffensberger|first=J|year=1993|title=Science is truly a male world: The interconnectedness of knowledge, gender and power within university education|journal=Gender and Education|volume=5|pages=37–54|doi=10.1080/0954025930050103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are not represented in senior jobs in the humanities even though most students in these fields are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=American Psychological Association|first=|year=2000|title=Women in academe: Two steps forward, one step back|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tenure ==
Women are underrepresented in tenured positions. From 2001 to 2009, women averaged 35% of all full-time faculty with tenure and 43% of all full-time faculty in non-tenure track positions in comparison to men's 50% and 32%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/08E023AB-E6D8-4DBD-99A0-24E5EB73A760/0/persistent_inequity.pdf|title=Persistent Inequity: Gender and Academic Employment|last=Curtis|first=John|date=2011-04-11|website=American Association of University Professors|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A case study performed by the Pennsylvania State University in 2006 attributes a majority of this gap to familial commitments and the avoidance strategies they create among faculty members.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drago|first=Robert|last2=Colbeck|first2=Carol L.|last3=Stauffer|first3=Kai Dawn|last4=Pirretti|first4=Amy|last5=Burkum|first5=Kurt|last6=Fazioli|first6=Jennifer|last7=Lazzaro|first7=Gabriela|last8=Habasevich|first8=Tara|date=2006-05|title=The Avoidance of Bias Against Caregiving|url=https://search-ebscohost-com.echo.louisville.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=eric&amp;AN=EJ718750&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=49|pages=1222-1247|issn=0002-7642|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it takes approximately between five to seven years for a faculty member to be considered for the position of associate professor with tenure; this system limits caregiving and family responsibilities until tenure is achieved, so faculty members may choose to delay marriage, parenthood, etc. until the desired position is acquired.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In particular, the careers of female academics are greatly hindered because the workplace tends to favor a male's career path. The travel, possibility of relocation and vigorous work schedules limit the participation of females due to family conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fothergill|first=Alice|last2=Feltey|first2=Kathryn|date=|title="I've Worked Very Hard and Slept Very Little": Mothers on Tenure Track in Academia|url=|journal=Journal of the Association for Research on Mothering|volume=5|pages=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 national survey, reported 16% of female faculty remained single because they did not have time for both a family and a successful career; of the female faculty who were parents, 17.2% chose to have one child but delayed even considering another until they had acquired their desired position.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These challenges associated with balancing work life and family life raise questions regarding the influence both marriage and motherhood have on the academic positions available to wives and mothers at colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perna|first=Laura W.|date=2001|title=The Relationship Between Family Responsibilities and Employment Status Among College and University Faculty|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2672882.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A334b6e7913e8dc9d9f333e8489b729ed|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|volume=72|issue=5|pages=584-611|doi=10.2307/2672882|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the increased support for family-friendly policies in the academic workplace, few have yet to be utilized fully. Many academies support paid parental leave, tenure-clock stoppage and flexible schedules; however, few faculty members of either sex choose to take advantage of these policies for fear of being penalized by their departments despite the institution's approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKv1D26YYLEC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=P6NwRrrtiv&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Parenting and Professing: Balancing Family Work with an Academic Career|last=Bassett|first=Rachel Hile|date=2005|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|year=|isbn=9780826514783|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Women are less likely to win academic awards. For instance, there are 48 women [[Nobel Prize]] winners, compared to 844 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/|title=Nobel Prize Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two-thirds of these winners won a Nobel Prize for a humanities discipline, not a science discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most scientific disciplines, a small portion of women full professors are nominated for awards compared to the number of women in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=27 January 2011|title=Scholar's awards mainly go to men|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/469472a|journal=Nature |volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Recognition of the Achievements of Women In Science, Medicine, and Engineering (RAISE) project have reported that the women represent 8.6% of [[Lasker Award]] winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leboy|first=Phoebe|date=1 January 2008|title=Fixing the Leaky Pipeline|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/25887/title/Fixing-the-Leaky-Pipeline/|journal=The Scientist|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women of color in academia ==
Women of color face specific issues related to sexism in academia as well. One such problem is referred to as the "Chilly Climate" problem, wherein, because women of color are infrequent in academia, they are often isolated and face a lack of institutional support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Kristie A.|date=2011|title=Race, Gender, and Bodily (Mis)Recognitions: Women of Color Faculty Experiences with White Students in the College Classroom|jstor=29789534|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|volume=82|issue=4|pages=444–478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, because women of color's bodies are both viewed racially and in terms of their gender in academia, their voices and identities are often overlooked through "elite racism", as coined by Allen, Epps, Guillory, Suh, and Bonous-Hammarth (2000). Because women of color in academia are sometimes minorities in regards to their colleagues as well as their students, it is suggested that they feel the aforementioned isolation, racism, and sexism from both groups.

Women of color in academia are not only seemingly ostracized by their colleagues, but by their students as well. Women faculty of color reported having their authority questioned and challenged, their teaching competency questioned and their knowledge and experience disrespected by their students. White male students were also seen to behave more aggressively towards these women and would also employ intimidating behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pittman|first=Chavella T.|date=2010|title=Race and Gender Oppression in the Classroom: The Experiences of Women Faculty of Color with White Male Students|jstor=27896528|journal=Teaching Sociology|volume=38|issue=3|pages=183–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the National Science Foundation's 2015 survey of Doctorate recipients, only 40.41% of U.S. doctorate scientists employed in teaching positions were women, 61,750 out of a sample of 152,800. Of the female population, 75.95% were White, 11.01% were Asian, 5.34% were Hispanic or Latino, 5.67% were Black or African American, 0.32% were American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 1.62% constituted other races, including Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and those who marked multiple races who were not Hispanic or Latino. In addition, Asian women held 3% of tenured positions, Latinas 2.4%, and Black women 2.3% according to a 2015 survey by the National Center for Education Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics.

==Women in academic publishing==
In many academic disciplines, women receive less credit for their research than men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ghiasi | first1 = Gita | last2 = Larivière | first2 = Vincent | last3 = Sugimoto | first3 = Cassidy R. | year = 2015 | title = On The Compliance Of Women Engineers With A Gendered Scientific System | url = | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 12| pages = 1–19 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145931 | pmid = 26716831 | pmc = 4696668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;1.    Sarsons, Heather. "Gender Differences in Recognition of Group Work". ''Harvard University.'' 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jenkins | first1 = Fiona | year = 2014 | title = Epistemic Credibility And Women In Philosophy | url = | journal = Australian Feminist Studies | volume = 29 | issue = 80| pages = 161–170 | doi = 10.1080/08164649.2014.928190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rigg | first1 = Lesley S. | last2 = McCarragher | first2 = Shannon | last3 = Krmenec | first3 = Andrew | year = 2012 | title = Authorship, Collaboration, And Gender: Fifteen Years Of Publication Productivity In Selected Geography Journals | url = | journal = Professional Geographer | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 491–502 | doi = 10.1080/00330124.2011.611434 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend is especially pronounced in engineering fields. A study published in 2015 by Gita Ghiasi, Vincent Lariviere, and Cassidy Sugimoto demonstrates that women represent 20% of all scientific production in the field of engineering. The study examined 679,338 engineering articles published between 2008 and 2013, and it analyzed the collaborative networks among 974,837 authors. Ghiasi et al. created networking diagrams, depicting the frequency of collaboration among authors, and the success of each collaboration was measured by the number of times the study was cited. The collaboration networks illustrate that mixed-gender teams have a higher average rate of productivity and citations, yet 50% of male engineers have collaborated only with other men and 38% of female engineers have collaborated only with men. The researchers use [[impact factor]]s—the average annual number of citation that a journal receives—to measure the prestige of academic journals. Their study shows that when women publish their research in journals with high-impact factors, they receive fewer citations from the engineering community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The authors explain their findings as a possible consequence of the "[[Matilda effect]]", a phenomenon that systematically undervalues the scientific contributions of women.

In addition to engineering, a gender bias in publishing is exemplified in economics. In 2015, Heather Sarsons released a working paper comparing credit allocated to men and women in collaborative research.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sarsons analyzed the publication records of economists at top universities over the past 40 years, and found that female economists publish work as frequently as their male cohorts, yet their tenure prospects are less than half that of men. Women receive comparable credit to men when they solo author their work or co-author with other female economist, evinced by a 8–9% increase in their tenure prospects, implying that tenure prospects decrease with collaborative work due to lack of credit given to women, not the quality of their work. Men receive the same amount of credit for solo authoring and co-authoring their work, shown by a 8–9% increase in their tenure prospects; however, when women co-author with men, there is no increase in their tenure prospects.

In the academic disciplines of political science and [[international relations]], research has found evidence of gender bias in publishing and teaching. The Teaching, Research and International Policy (TRIP) project gathers data and publishes analysis on the discipline of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trip.wm.edu/|title=Home {{!}} Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP)|website=trip.wm.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a study published by Daniel Maliniak, Ryan Powers and [[Barbara F. Walter]] used TRIP data from peer-reviewed publications between 1980 and 2006 to show that women are systematically cited less than men after controlling for a number of variables including year and venue of publication, substantive focus, theoretical perspective, methodology, tenure status, and institutional affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maliniak|first=Daniel|last2=Powers|first2=Ryan|last3=Walter|first3=Barbara F.|date=2013/10|title=The Gender Citation Gap in International Relations|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/gender-citation-gap-in-international-relations/3A769C5CFA7E24C32641CDB2FD03126A|journal=International Organization|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=889–922|doi=10.1017/S0020818313000209|issn=0020-8183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 study on publishing patterns in political science journals, Dawn Langan Teele and [[Kathleen Thelen]] found that women authors are underrepresented compared to the share of women working in the profession, are not benefiting from the trend toward co-authored publications (dominated by all-male author teams), and lose out from the methodological partiality of top journals in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teele|first=Dawn Langan|last2=Thelen|first2=Kathleen|date=2017/04|title=Gender in the Journals: Publication Patterns in Political Science|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/gender-in-the-journals-publication-patterns-in-political-science/07452099DCDCBF378D233FF402C97DEA|journal=PS: Political Science &amp; Politics|language=en|volume=50|issue=2|pages=433–447|doi=10.1017/S1049096516002985|issn=1049-0965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activism aimed at uprooting gender bias in academic publishing and teaching has increased over the years and has led to initiatives such as #womenalsoknowstuff&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womenalsoknowstuff.com/|title=Women Also Know Stuff|website=womenalsoknowstuff.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, #womenalsoknowhistory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://womenalsoknowhistory.com/|title=Women Also Know History|work=Women Also Know History|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Jane Lawrence Sumner's Gender Balance Assessment Tool (GBAT)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jlsumner.shinyapps.io/syllabustool/|title=Gender Balance Assessment Tool (GBAT)|website=jlsumner.shinyapps.io|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2015, Jeff Colgan conducted an analysis of American post-graduate international relations syllabi and found that 82% of assigned reading was written by all-male authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://duckofminerva.com/2015/08/new-evidence-on-gender-bias-in-ir-syllabi.html|title=New Evidence on Gender Bias in IR Syllabi {{!}} Duck of Minerva|website=duckofminerva.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[London School of Economics]], a student-led body called the Gender and Diversity Project (GDP) conducted a similar assessment of syllabi from the full teaching curriculum in the International Relations department from 2015 to 2016. The results, published in 2018 (see Kiran Phull, Gokhan Ciflikli and Gustav Meibauer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phull|first=Kiran|last2=Ciflikli|first2=Gokhan|last3=Meibauer|first3=Gustav|date=2018-08-20|title=Gender and bias in the International Relations curriculum: Insights from reading lists|journal=European Journal of International Relations|language=en|pages=135406611879169|doi=10.1177/1354066118791690|issn=1354-0661}}&lt;/ref&gt;), revealed that 79.2% of assigned reading from all undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate syllabi was authored exclusively by male authors, with the undergraduate curriculum being the least gender-diverse.

'''''Shnaim Ohazin''''' ({{lang-he|שניים אוחזין}}, lit. ''Two people holding''), was a [[television show]] broadcast on the [[Israeli Educational Television]] during the 1980s that dealt with teaching basic concepts of the [[Talmud]] and Jewish heritage. The concept of the show was Mr. Bar and Mr. Orian meet to study [[Gemara]] (Talmud) together. The show was incorporated in the past as part of the 7th-grade curriculum in [[secondary school|secondary]] [[yeshiva]]s, or 9th-grade curriculum in secular Hebrew-speaking schools, and a study booklet was added in 1989, written and edited by Benjamin Domovitz.

== Structure ==
The show had two hosts, Baruch Bar (The tall one &amp;mdash; [[Itzik Sayedoff]]) and Ori Orian (The chubby one &amp;mdash; [[Avi Oriah]]), who used a study room that has been converted to a television studio where they learn different topics in the Talmud while focusing on explaining basic concepts.  The hosts are aware of the cameras and audience. After explaining the topic from the writings the two argue among themselves over the explanation of the subject.  Then in a fictionalized segment they go back in time to the period of the [[Mishnah]] (around 200 CE) and discuss the topic of the day with ordinary people from the era, to try to learn which of their interpretations is correct.

Almost all the chapters addressed interpretation and clarification of basic Talmud concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Except for chapter 9: "Who is afraid of Aramaic" which dealt with learning [[Aramaic language]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== The meaning of "Shnaim Ohazin" ==
[[Image:Shaniam Ohazin-1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Baruch Bar and Ori Oriah at their study tables.]]
The name of the show is ''Shnaim Ohazin'' (Two who are holding) with a double meaning: The show speaks of studying the Talmud, and "[[Shnaim Ohazin (Talmud)|Shnaim Ohazin]]" is one of the famous Talmud chapters dealing with a division Principle,&lt;ref&gt;[[Seder Nezikin]], [[Bava Metzia]] [[Tract (literature)|tract]], First chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the name suggests that there are two teachers holding the [[Gemara]] and are learning and teaching it.

The point of this is explained by Dr. [[Yehuda Schwartz]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Talmudic study is active with negotiating in a "[[Havruta]]" while viewing is passive. The study of the Talmud is mostly textual, while the television medium is not characterized by book and words.  On top of that, study of the Talmud involves continual negotiation between the study partners, and this is difficult to present by television. The solution to these problems is found in the broadcast through creation of a dialogue between two participants: "Bar" and "Orian". The broadcast does not come in order to replace the study of Talmud but it is used as a helping instrument along with a guide to the teacher and paper assignments for the student."&lt;ref&gt;Doctorate on [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/toshba/horaat/b6-2.htm Oral Torah] part two chapter c, Yehuda Schwartz (daat.ac.il)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The names of the teachers on the show also hold a [[symbol]]ic meaning: the names of both teachers Baruch Bar and Ori Orian ({{lang-he|'''ב'''רוך '''ב'''ר ו'''א'''ורי '''א'''וריין}}) are an [[alliteration]], their last names put together composes the term "Bar Orian" (Son/Student of the Torah in Aramaic, or "scholar" in [[Modern Hebrew]]). The name of Bar and Orian's teacher also suggests of his role: Shlomo '''Melamed''' ({{lang-he|מלמד}}, Teaches).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2688">'''The Kennedy Airlift''' occurred in 1959 and 1960 and saw hundreds of east Africans get scholarships to study in the US. It was arranged by [[Tom Mboya]] and Senator [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name= jfk&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/JFK-and-the-Student-Airlift.aspx| title = JFK and the Student Airlift| publisher = [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum]]| access-date = 27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The program began in earnest in 1959 when Mboya embarked on a speaking tour of the United States seeking scholarships for students from East Africa. The first batch of students, 81 in total, touched down on New York City in September 11 1959. These students would be settled in various universities in the United States and Canada. In Kenya, Mboya liaised with Julius Kiano and Kariuki Njiiri to identify potential students for the airlifts. Kiano and Njiiri were both alumni of American universities &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/magazine/Airlifts-to-the-US-The-first-Kenyans-to-study-in-America/434746-3472918-8ak1w4/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The airlifts were opposed by Britain. Kenya was Britain's colony and Britain did not want America meddling with any of its colonies. British officials spread propaganda amongst top Kenyan students that American education was inferior to British education.

==Legacy==
The airlifts officially ended in 1963. Most of the graduates from American and Canadian colleges and universities went back to help build the newly independent Kenya. Some were employed even before they graduated. They were mainly employed in the public administration sector as district and provincial officers. While men found it easy to get jobs they qualified for, women faced a tougher challenge. Many were offered secretarial duties despite being better qualified than most male officers in the same departments.

==Notable Beneficiaries==
Over 800 students, mainly from Kenya, benefited from the Kennedy Airlift. Some of the more notable ones include:

[[Pamela Mboya|Pamela Odede Mboya]]

[[Wangari Maathai]]

[[Reuben_Olembo|Prof Reuben Olembo]]

Perez Olindo

Phillip Ochieng

Owino Okongo

==Barack Obama Snr==
Contrary to some media reports, Barack Obama Snr, Barack Obama's father, was not a beneficiary of the airlifts. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/african-airlift/&lt;/ref&gt; He received private funding to attend the University of Hawaii. He is, however, considered part of the 'airlift generation'.

== Focus Areas ==

Consistent with its "Land for People" mission, The Trust for Public Land is widely known for urban conservation work, including New York City playgrounds and community gardens,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/nyregion/a-new-playground-in-the-bronx-soaks-up-the-citys-problematic-storm-water.html|title=A New Playground in the Bronx Soaks Up the City’s Problematic Storm Water|last=Foderaro|first=Lisa W.|date=2015-06-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/community-gardens/movement|title=History of the Community Garden Movement : NYC Parks|website=www.nycgovparks.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's [[Bloomingdale Line|606]] linear park,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-606-trail-anniversary-met-0531-20160602-story.html|title=The 606 trail, a study in contrasts, celebrates its first birthday|last=Vivanco|first=Leonor|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Los Angeles green alleys,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/science/climate-change-alley-ways-water.html|title=Los Angeles Looks for Extra Water Down Its Alleys|last=Schlossberg|first=Tatiana|date=2016-07-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lastormwater.org/green-la/south-la-green-alley-master-plan/|title=South LA Green Alley Master Plan « City of Los Angeles Stormwater Program|work=City of Los Angeles Stormwater Program|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate-Smart Cities programs in 20 American cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/how-we-work/climate-smart-cities#sm.0000f0sjbvumjfb9zva1tpr3x2n9a|title=Climate-Smart Cities™|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The 10-Minute Walk" initiative, which aims to put a high-quality park or open space within a 10-minute walk of every resident of every U.S. urban census tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/10minutewalk|title=Everyone deserves a park|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-institute/voices/col-urban-parks-10-minute-challenge.html|title=Urban Parks and the 10-Minute Challenge|website=www.governing.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Trust for Public Land simultaneously focuses on public access-oriented land protection, such as additions to [[Yosemite National Park]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/08/493081963/yosemite-national-park-grows-toward-west-in-largest-expansion-since-1949|title=Yosemite National Park Grows Toward West In Largest Expansion Since 1949|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Appalachian Trail]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2017/04/college-sells-farm-to-be-added-to-the-appalachian-trail|title=College sells farm to be added to the Appalachian Trail|work=The Dartmouth|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cape Cod National Seashore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wgbh.org/wcai/ccns4.cfm|title=WCAI {{!}} Cape Cod National Seashore Anniversary|website=www.wgbh.org|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other national, state, and municipal parks across America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303612804577533912723969448|title=Land Rush at National Parks|last=Carlton|first=Jim|date=2012-07-22|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/miles-of-california-coastline-to-be-preserved/2012/04/14/gIQApsfHIT_story.html|title=Miles of California coastline to be preserved|last=Barboza|first=Tony|date=2012-04-14|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncparks.gov/lumber-river-state-park-expands-1054-acres-trust-public-land-help|title=Lumber River State Park expands by 1,054 acres with Trust for Public Land help {{!}} NC State Parks|website=www.ncparks.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also prioritizes projects that celebrate and advance [[social equity]], like helping to create [[Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park]], the [[Stonewall National Monument]], and the [[Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of the Stewarts Point Rancheria|Kashia]] Coastal Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ownership of Tribal Land Restored at the Kashia Coastal Reserve|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/california-coastal-trail/ownership-of-tribal-land-restored-at-the-kashia-coastal-reserve|language=en|accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although The Trust for Public Land is an accredited [[land trust]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.landtrustalliance.org/39-land-trusts-achieve-national-recognition|title=39 Land Trusts Achieve National Recognition|last=skatz|date=2017-08-10|website=www.landtrustalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the organization differs from conventional land trusts in that it does not generally hold or steward conservation property interests. Instead, The Trust for Public Land works with community members, public agencies, and other conservation [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] to identify park-creation and land protection projects, and then helps plan, fund, protect, and/or create those spaces, with ownership of any resulting property interests typically transferring to locale, state, or federal public agencies, or to other conservation NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/frequently-asked-questions-0|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to creating parks and protecting open spaces, The Trust for Public Land is a leading advocate for public conservation funding at the local, state, and federal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/policy-legislation|title=Policy &amp; Legislation|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/how-we-work/fund|title=Fund|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/2144781/6-best-environmental-groups-donate-better-world|title=The 6 Best Environmental Groups to Donate to for a Better World|last=Callaghan|first=Anna|date=2016-12-28|work=Outside Online|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through campaigns, ballot measures, and legislative advocacy, the organization works—often in concert with its affiliated [[501(c)4]] nonprofit, The Trust for Public Land Action Fund—to ensure adequate funding for many of the federal and state public funding programs relied on by public park and conservation agencies, and by conservation NGOs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tplactionfund.org/what-we-do/our-strategy/|title=Strategy - The Trust for Public Land Action Fund|work=The Trust for Public Land Action Fund|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/lwcf|title=LWCF: four letters you should know|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Trust for Public Land was founded in San Francisco in 1972 by [[Huey Johnson]], the former western regional director of [[The Nature Conservancy]], and other San Francisco Bay Area and national lawyers and conservationists. Johnson’s goal was to create an organization that would use emerging real estate, legal, and financial techniques to conserve land for human use and public benefit. An additional founding goal was to extend the conservation and environmental movements to cities, where an increasingly large segment of the population lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt1199n4bs&amp;brand=oac4&amp;doc.view=entire_text|title=Trust for Public Land Founding Member and President, 1972-1997: the Ethics and Practice of Land Conservation,|website=oac.cdlib.org|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Trust for Public Land programs of the 1970s and ‘80s included:

* ''The Urban Land Program'', which led to the creation of parks and gardens in [[Oakland, California]], San Francisco, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey]], and other cities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt1199n4bs&amp;brand=oac4&amp;doc.view=entire_text|title=Trust for Public Land Founding Member and President, 1972-1997: the Ethics and Practice of Land Conservation |website=oac.cdlib.org|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Public Land Program'', which included transactions that helped create the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]], [[Cuyahoga Valley National Park]], and the [[Sawtooth National Recreation Area]] in [[Idaho]], among other parks and preserves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* ''The Land Trust Program'', which helped found or train about one-third of the nation’s then-existing local [[land trust]]s. In the 1980s, the Trust for Public Land joined other groups to found the [[Land Trust Alliance]], in order to train and support local land trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.landtrustalliance.org/about/history|title=History|last=Administrator|date=2014-09-15|website=www.landtrustalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Trust for Public Land Action Fund ==
As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, The Trust for Public Land is legally limited in the amount it can spend on campaigning for legislative and ballot measures. In 2000, the organization launched a 501(c)(4) affiliate, The Conservation Campaign, which is not limited in such spending. This affiliate entity is now called The Trust for Public Land Action Fund and frequently works with The Trust for Public Land to help pass local and state conservation finance measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tplactionfund.org/|title=Home - The Trust for Public Land Action Fund|website=The Trust for Public Land Action Fund|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Sterling''' is Professor of [[Computer Science]] at [[Indiana University]], a Faculty Associate at [[Caltech|California Institute of Technology]], and a Distinguished Visiting Scientist at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]. He received his [[PhD]] as a [[Hertz Foundation|Hertz Fellow]] from [[MIT]] in 1984. He is probably best known as the father of [[Beowulf (computing)|Beowulf clusters]] (developed in collaboration with [[Donald Becker|Don Becker]]) and for his research on Petaflops computing architecture.  Professor Sterling is the co-author of six books and holds six patents. He was awarded the [[Gordon Bell Prize]] with collaborators in 1997. Dr. Sterling is working on a computational model called ParalleX, an advanced message-driven split-transaction computing model for scalable low-power fault-tolerant operation. In addition, he is developing an ultra lightweight supervisor runtime kernel in support of MIND and other fine grain architectures (like CELL) and the Agincourt parallel programming language for high efficiency through intrinsics in support of latency hiding and low overhead synchronization for both conventional and innovative parallel computer architectures.

==Life==
Tom Sleigh was born in [[Mount Pleasant, Texas]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; where he lived until the age of five, when he moved to [[Utah]]. He lived in Utah until seventh grade, when he moved to [[California]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/agni/interviews/online/2003/sleigh-wong.html AGNI Online: Interview with Tom Sleigh by Allegra Wong&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[California Institute of the Arts]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; [[Evergreen State College]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; and the Writing Seminars [[Johns Hopkins University]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2000/mar00/sleigh.html Dartmouth News - Dartmouth professor Thomas Sleigh nominated for L.A.

==Artistic influences==
In an interview published in the literary journal [[AGNI (magazine)|''AGNI'']], Sleigh lists his poetic influences:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'd have to say that [[Robert Browning|Browning]] for his technique; [[Wallace Stevens]] for a certain quality of gravitas, what [[Keats]] feels near his death, when he said he was living a sort of posthumous existence; [[Philip Larkin]] for his sense of extremity; [[Ezra Pound|Pound]] for his fluidity of conception and hardness of execution; [[Baudelaire]] for his music and intense scrutiny and affection for street life; and [[Elizabeth Bishop|Bishop]] and [[Robert Lowell|Lowell]] for their immersion in the physical world, would be my fathers and mothers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

'''UNESCO-CHIC Group (China) [[Biosphere]] Rural and [[Urbanization]] Programme (UNESCO-CHIC BIRUP)''' is listed as [[UNESCO]] global demonstration programme.

BIRUP’s aim is to narrow the gap between rural and urban areas by redefining the relationship and realizing the [[sustainable development]] of an integrated [[urban economy|urban]] and [[rural economy]], society, environment, culture, and education. BIRUP uses the market as the guide and high quality [[agriculture|agricultural]] education and [[science]] development as the engine to promote industry linkages to balance production, [[ecology]], and life. The programme seeks to implement a new concept to integrate [[urban development|urban]] and [[rural development]] known as ‘town in the rural, rural in the city’. BIRUP attempts to solve [[China|Chinese]] three-rural issues from the origin.&lt;ref name="UNESCO-CHIC Biosphere Integrated Rural Urbanization Project (BIRUP)"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/unesco_chic_biosphere_integrated_rural_urbanization_project_birup/], UNESCO-CHIC Biosphere Integrated Rural Urbanization Project (BIRUP).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''XR-2''' is an [[education]]al [[robot]] made by [[Rhino Robotics]].

The robot is a multi-jointed arm, having five [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]]. (It has six degrees of freedom when attached to the optional sliding base.)
The arm is constructed of [[aluminum]] and the workings of the robot, such as geared [[electric motor]]s and their [[rotary encoder]]s, are visible.
A controller, based on the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] CPU also found in the robot's contemporary,&lt;!-- The Apple II is not a robot so it cannot be a contemporary --&gt; the Apple II, can control up to eight motors - the robot and two other items, such as a turntable or the aforementioned sliding base.
There is a teach pendant, rather like those of full-size [[industrial robot]]s, that can be connected to the controller. Using this, the robot can be "taught" simple [[Computer program|programs]] using the pendant and can then repeat them.

==Controller interface==

The interface for the motor controller is based on a [[RS-232]] [[serial port]]. (9600 [[baud]], 7 data bits, 2 stop bits, even parity.) The controller, while in one physical box, is actually two machines. The one on the top is the teach pendant computer, the one below is the motor controller proper.
One can connect a computer to this serial port and send the robot commands. The commands are very simple, and many are based on text, so the controller can be commanded with a simple [[serial terminal]] or a [[terminal emulator]] program running on a [[personal computer|PC]].

The command 'F+100', for instance, will cause the F motor to move 100 units.
'F-100' would reverse the movement. Generally, the commands refer to one of the eight motors that controller can move, labeled A, B, C ... H.
The number must not be larger than 127 or smaller than 128, or the signed byte holding it will overflow.

Another command is 'F?', (Where F could be any motor label). This command inquires how many steps of the current movement instruction have not yet been performed. A [[byte]] is returned, but 32 must be subtracted from this byte to get the true number of steps remaining - 32 is added so that the returned character is always a printing character and not a control character.
