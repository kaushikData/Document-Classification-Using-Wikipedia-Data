The '''Accademia dei Risvegliati''' was a brotherhood founded in [[Pistoia]] ([[Tuscany]], in central Italy) during the seventeenth century by Felice Cancellieri and the noble Federigo Manni, who was the first prince.

It was formed by members of the nobility of Pistoia and the meetings revolved around poetry and music. In 1694 the academy had built a real theater, which was managed by the Accademia dei Risvegliati until its extinction. The Academy was closed in the last century and was replaced by the Teatro Regio, today Teatro Manzoni.

The '''Albanian Power Corporation''' ({{sq|Korporata Elektroenergjitike Shqiptare - KESH}}) is the largest electricity producing company in [[Albania]].
KESH operates the most important [[Power plant|electricity generating plants]] in the country. They include: The [[Drin River]] Cascade hydropower plants (Fierza HPP, Komani HPP and Vau i Dejës HPP), with an installed power capacity of 1,350 MW, and the
Vlora TPP, with an installed power capacity of 98 MW. The cascade, built on the Drin River, is the largest in the [[Balkan]] region by installed capacity, as well as by the size of the hydropower plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rtsh.al/lajme/shtohen-prurjet-nga-rreshjet-kesh-rrit-kuotat-e-prodhimit-dhe-shitjes Shtohen prurjet nga rreshjet; KESH rrit kuotat e prodhimit dhe shitjes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ata.gov.al/reshjet-rriten-prurjet-ne-hidrocentrale-kesh-nis-eksportin Rriten prurjet në hidroçentrale. KESH nis eksportin.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By operating 79% of the generation capacity in the country, KESH supplies about 70-75% of the customers' demand for electricity, provides the energy needed to cover the losses in the transmission grid, as well as guarantees the security of the Albanian energy system through balancing energy and auxiliary
services. KESH is also responsible for the administration, the proper operation as well as for guaranteeing the technical and operational safety of the power plants it operates.

The '''Appenzell''', {{lang-fr|'''Chèvre d’Appenzell'''|italic=no}}, {{lang-de|'''Appenzellerziege'''|italic=no}},&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; is a rare and endangered indigenous [[breed]] of long-haired white [[goat|domestic goat]] from Switzerland. It originates in the [[canton (administrative division)|"half-cantons"]] of the historic [[Appenzell]] region, [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]] and [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], and has spread into the neighbouring [[Canton of St. Gallen]].&lt;ref name=szzv/&gt; 

==History==

Documentation of the Appenzell breed goes back more than 100 years. A goat-breeders' association, the ''Ziegenzuchtgenossenschaft Appenzell'', was founded in Innerrhoden in February 1902, and another, the ''Ziegenzuchtgenossenschaft Urnäsch'', in Ausserrhoden in 1914.  The ''Schweizerischer Ziegenzuchtverband'', the Swiss federation of cantonal goat breeders' associations, runs a conservation and recovery project for the Appenzell which includes financial support for breeders and a controlled breeding programme.&lt;ref name=save/&gt; In 2007 conservation status of the breed was listed by the [[FAO]] as "endangered-maintained".&lt;ref name=barb/&gt; 

In 2005, the Appenzell breed represented about 4.2% of the total registered Swiss goat population of about 70,000 head.&lt;ref name=szzv/&gt; At the end of 2013 a population of 1900–2000 was reported to [[DAD-IS]].&lt;ref name=dad/&gt;

The '''Arab Islamic Republic''' ({{lang-ar|الجمهورية العربية الإسلامية}} ''{{transl|ar|al-Jumhūrīyah al-‘Arabīyah al-Islāmīyah}}'') was a proposed [[Political union|unification]] of [[Tunisia]] and [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]] in 1974, agreed upon by [[List of heads of state of Libya|Libyan head of state]] [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[List of Presidents of Tunisia|Tunisian President]] [[Habib Bourguiba]]. Additional countries — [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] — were later included in  the proposal, which was never implemented.

==Regional context==
The attempted merger between Tunisia and Libya took place in a historical and regional context. Maghrebi regional politics played a role embedded into the constitutions of Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria is the ideal of Maghrebi unity,&lt;ref&gt;Aghrout, A. &amp; Sutton, K. (1990). Regional Economic Union in the Maghrib. ''The Journal of Modern African Studies'', 28(1), 115&lt;/ref&gt; however contradicting this ideal is the competing interests of Morocco and Algeria, the region's two major powers. According to Tunisian scholar M. J. Deeb, "if there were only Algeria and not Morocco, or Morocco and not Algeria, there could never have been a Maghrib. The major power would have swallowed us all up. To have the Maghrib you need those two rival powers competing with each other in the region".&lt;ref&gt;Deeb, M. J. (1989). Inter-Maghribi Relations Since 1969: A Study of the Modalities of Unions and Mergers. ''Middle East Journal, 43''(1), 22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus attempts at unification within the Maghrib were more often than not the means by which to counterbalance one or both of the region's major powers.

Additionally, [[Pan-Arabism]] influenced the politics of the Arab world. Muammar Gaddafi was a well-known proponent of this ideology and had thus worked to achieve union with several Arab states such as Egypt, Syria, Sudan and Tunisia. He also sought union with Chad. Tunisia was initially suspicions of Gaddafi's intentions, but the Libyan leader visited [[Tunis]] in February 1971 and December 1972,&lt;ref name="Wright, J 2008"&gt;Wright, J. 2008. ''The Emergence of Libya''. London: Silphium Press, 344-5&lt;/ref&gt; and, in a rally in that city during the latter visit, spoke of supporting a union between Libya and Tunisia.&lt;ref name="Wright, J 1981"&gt;Wright, J. 1981. ''Libya: A Modern History''. London: Croom Helm, 165&lt;/ref&gt;  Hearing the speech by Gaddafi live at his home over the radio, President Bourguiba rushed to the rally where, after he let Gaddafi finish, he took to the stage and denounced the idea that "the Arabs had ever been united, dismissed all of [Gaddafi's] ideas about rapid Arab unity, and even took the Libyans to task for what he described as their own lack of national unity and their backwardness".&lt;ref name="Wright, J 1981" /&gt;  Close Libyan-Egyptian ties troubled [[Maghreb]]i leaders who feared the proximity of [[Egypt]] on their eastern borders and thus worked to pull Libya away from Egyptian influence.&lt;ref&gt;Deeb, M. J. (1989). Inter-Maghribi Relations Since 1969: A Study of the Modalities, Unions and Mergers. ''Middle East Journal'', 43(1), 23&lt;/ref&gt; At the fourth annual [[Non-Aligned Movement]] conference in [[Algiers]], Bourguiba called for the unification of Algeria, Tunisia and Libya to form a "United States of North Africa", a move which he qualified by proposing it take place in stages over an "unspecified period of time".&lt;ref&gt;Deeb, M. J. (1989). Inter-Maghribi Relations Since 1969: A Study of the Modalities of Unions and Mergers. ''Middle East Journal'', 43(1), 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3QEAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22united+states+of+north+africa%22&amp;dq=%22united+states+of+north+africa%22&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=LeGrS8ujCM79_Aar6-W1Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA Africa research bulletin: economic, financial and technical series, Volume 10, 1973]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Djerba Declaration==
On 11 January 1974, the Djerba Declaration was signed by Bourgiba and Gaddafi, which committed the two states to becoming a single state, to be named the Arab Islamic Republic.&lt;ref name="Simons, G 1993"&gt;Simons, G. 1993. ''Libya: The struggle for Survival''. New York: St. Martin's Press, 253&lt;/ref&gt;  The agreement was signed on the Island of [[Djerba]] and thus, is also known as the Djerba Declaration&lt;ref name="Simons, G 1993" /&gt; or the Djerba Accord. Referendums were scheduled in each country to vote on the issue. The spontaneous tactic in trying to gain unity with another state on the part of Gaddafi displays a different approach than the previous union attempt with Egypt, where long negotiations did not work out.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wright, J. 1981. ''Libya: A Modern History''. London: Croom Helm, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that Bourguiba was the original pursuant of a union between Libya and Tunisia, as Bourguiba wanted a regional ally and also wanted to "wean Libya away from Egypt".&lt;ref&gt;Deeb, M. J. "Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya" in ''The Government and Politics of the Middle East and North Africa. 4th ed''. David E. Long and Bernard Reich eds. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 386. [https://books.google.com/books?id=r2ArLdzYH_kC&amp;printsec=copyright&amp;dq=%22arab+islamic+republic%22&amp;source=gbs_toc_s&amp;cad=1#PPR4,M1 Google Books] (April 4, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The union agreement was a surprise to observers, as previously it was thought that Bourguiba had not supported the idea, in part due to tensions brought about by the speech by Gaddafi in Tunis in December 1972. This change in support could also have been influenced by the presence of 30,000 Tunisians working in Libya at the time and helping the Tunisian economy.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, G. 1993. ''Libya: The struggle for Survival.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Tunisia suffered from a labour surplus, a foreign debt of one billion and a lack of natural resources, a closer economic union with the resource rich but labour poor Libya would have been an attractive alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Broken Engagement, January 28, 1974, ''Time Magazine'', [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911064-2,00.html Time.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Why Bourguiba decided to agree to the union is not completely known, but it is known that the Djerba agreement was seen with suspicion by Tunisians and Algerians, as well as outside these states both regionally and internationally.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

The Arab Islamic Republic was supposed to have "a single constitution, a single army, and a single President."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Simons, G. 1993. ''Libya: The struggle for Survival''. New York: St. Martin's Press, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the agreement, Bourguiba was to be President, but Gaddafi wanted to keep the Ministry of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;El-Kikhia, M. O. 1997. ''Libya's Qaddafi: The Politics of Contradiction''. Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, 121&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the Djerba Declaration multiple agreements dealing with singular, separate issues had previously been arranged between the two states on "trade, customs duties, investment, regulation for migrant workers, social security, and the creation of a joint shipping company,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; but the agreements were not publicly noted as pursuing a union of the two states. Support for the unity beyond Bourguiba came from others within the Tunisian government, thinking that it would further benefit the Tunisian economy; the most prominent supporter was Tunisian Foreign Minister Mohammed Masmoudi.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

The length of time the union lasted is contentious, with one source saying it lasted one month, while another says it lasted only a single day and a third indicating it lasted a few days.&lt;ref&gt;El-Kikhia, M. O. 1997. ''Libya's Qaddafi: The Politics of Contradiction''. Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, 21. ; Simons, G. 1993. ''Libya: The struggle for Survival''. New York: St. Martin's Press, 254. ; Wright, J. 1981. ''Libya: A Modern History''. London: Croom Helm, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;   What is known though is that Tunisia reconsidered the deal soon after signing it, as Tunisia was supportive of economic benefits gained from the union, but not for giving up Tunisian sovereignty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Simons, G. 1993. ''Libya: The struggle for Survival''. New York: St. Martin's Press, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, as the Tunisian Socialist Destour Party resisted the union plans due to their view that the arrangement was not clear enough and did not include how political institutions would be structured, Bourguiba rescinded on his decision to form the Arab Islamic Republic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;  The referendum in Tunisia was postponed, as announced on January 12, 1974. Following Bourguiba's removal of Tunisia from the agreement, the biggest supporter of the union, Tunisian Foreign Minister Masmoudi was fired.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

Before the agreement was dissolved, Gaddafi had thought that one merger within the region would lead to regional unification and ultimately unification of the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, J. 1981. ''Libya: A Modern History''. London: Croom Helm, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the union's inception and fallout, Bourguiba's judgement and capacity to lead Tunisia was questioned after he announced the union with Libya.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, A. 1998. ''Modern Tunisia: A Democratic Apprenticeship''. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bechir Ben Yahmed, a Tunisian journalist noted, "For me, he [Bourguiba] died in January, 1974, in Djerba, when during several minutes of face-to-face with Gaddafi, he signed, on hotel stationary, that famous charter of union."&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, A. 1998. ''Modern Tunisia: A Democratic Apprenticeship''. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure of the Djerba Declaration==
As a consequence of the ideological differences, there was also a considerable divergence as to what the merger would look like.  As understood by Bourguiba, the states themselves would not dissipate, but rather their borders would become "cooperatively permeable" through "functional integration,"&lt;ref name="Zartman, I. W. 1987"&gt;Zartman, I. W. (1987). Foreign Relations of North Africa. ''International Affairs in Africa'' (Jan), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; in a similar manner to the contemporary [[Arab Maghreb Union|Arab Maghrib Union]], formed over a decade later.  Conversely, Gaddafi was more interested in a complete merging of Libya and Tunisia into the Arab Islamic Republic.  He saw Libya as a revolutionary movement rather than a territorial state. Gaddafi felt that they were one people, and that the borders were only a product of the ruling elites and imperialist division by conquerors.&lt;ref name="Zartman, I. W. 1987" /&gt;

Finally, there were the regional political difficulties.  As has been mentioned before, Libyan-Egyptian relations were steadily deteriorating following 1973. In light of the reduced Egyptian threat, Algeria felt it no longer necessary and even undesirable to merge with Libya and was not in favour of Tunisia doing so either.&lt;ref&gt;Deeb, M. J. (1989). Inter-Maghribi Relations Since 1969: A Study of the Modalities of Unions and Mergers. ''Middle East Journal, 43''(1), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, within twenty four hours of the Republic's announcement, Algeria threatened Tunisia with military intervention if Tunisia went ahead with the unification.&lt;ref&gt;Deeb, M. J. (1989). Inter-Maghribi Relations Since 1969: A Study of the Modalities of Unions and Mergers. ''Middle East Journal, 43''(1), 25&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also accusations of Tunisian foreign ministers being bribed by Libya.  Whatever the case may be, the unification with Libya never ended up happening and relations between the two countries steadily deteriorated.

'''Bannik''' is the [[Public bathing|bathhouse]] ([[banya (sauna)|banya]]) spirit in [[Slavic mythology]].&lt;ref name=Alexinsky&gt;Alexinsky, G. ''Slavonic Mythology'' in ''New Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology''. Prometheus Press, 1973, p. 287-88 &lt;/ref&gt; Slavic bathhouses resemble [[sauna]]s, with an inner steaming room and an outer changing room. A place where women gave [[childbirth|birth]] and practiced [[divination]]s, the bathhouse was strongly endowed with vital forces. The third firing (or fourth, depending on tradition) was reserved for the Bannik, and, given his inclination to invite demons and forest spirits to share his bath, no [[Christianity|Christian]] images were allowed lest they offend the occupants. If disturbed by an intruder while washing, the Bannik might pour boiling water over him, or even strangle him.&lt;ref name=Alexinsky/&gt;  

The Bannik had the ability to predict the future.  One consulted him by standing with one's back exposed in the half-open door of the bath.  The Bannik would gently stroke one's back if all boded well; but if trouble lay ahead, he would strike with his claws.&lt;ref name=Alexinsky/&gt;

'''Consumers International''' is the membership organisation for consumer groups around the world. Founded on 1 April 1960, it has over 250 member organisations in 120 countries. Its head office is based in [[London]], England, with regional officers in Latin America, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa.

Consumers International is a [[Non-profit organisation|not-for-profit]] [[company limited by guarantee]], company number 04337865 and [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] number 1122155.

== History ==
The organisation was first established in 1960 as the International Organisation of Consumers Unions (IOCU) by national [[consumer organisation]]s who wanted to create cross-border campaigns and share knowledge.

IOCU was founded by Elizabeth Schadee, who would later chair the board of the Netherlands' [[Consumentenbond]], and Caspar Brook, who was the first director of the United Kingdom's [[Which?|Consumers' Association]].&lt;ref name="brobeck"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brobeck|first=Stephen|title=Encyclopedia of the consumer movement|year=1997|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Santa Barbara, Calif. [u.a.]|pages=175–179|isbn=0874369878}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two proposed an international conference to plan for consumer product testing organisations worldwide to work more closely together.&lt;ref name="brobeck"/&gt; The United States organization [[Consumers Union]] provided {{USD|10000}} at the request of [[Colston Warne]] to help fund the event.&lt;ref name="brobeck"/&gt;

In January 1960, these three organisations sponsored the First International Conference on Consumer Testing in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name="brobeck"/&gt; Thirty-four people representing seventeen consumer organisations in fourteen countries attended to discuss product testing and founding the International Organisation of Consumers Unions as an international organisation.&lt;ref name="brobeck"/&gt; [[Belgium]]'s [[Test-Achats|Association des Consommateurs]] and the [[Choice (Australian consumer organisation)|Australian Consumers' Association]] joined the three conference sponsors as the five founding organisations who became the international organisation's initial council.&lt;ref name="brobeck"/&gt;

== Membership ==
Consumers International has over 250 member organisations in 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumersinternational.org/our-members/member-directory/|title=Our members - Consumers International|website=www.consumersinternational.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These members are independent consumer organisations.

About two-thirds of member organisations are in [[Developing country|economically developing countries]], the other third in [[Developed country|industrialised countries]].

Consumers International also works with and hosts the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tacd.org/about-tacd/|title=TACD.org|website=tacd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a forum of US and EU consumer organisations that develops and agrees on consumer policy recommendations to the US government and [[European Union]] to promote the consumer interest in EU and US policy making – at its office in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspirg.org/blogs/eds-blog/usp/debating-trade-and-consumer-protection-brussels-today|title=Debating trade and consumer protection in Brussels today - U.S. PIRG|website=www.uspirg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Consumer Rights Day ==
On 15 March 1962&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=9108 |title=John F. Kennedy: Special Message to the Congress on Protecting the Consumer Interest. |first=John F. |last=Kennedy |authorlink=John F. Kennedy |work=presidency.ucsb.edu |date=March 15, 1962 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; former [[President of the United States|US President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] said:

{{quote|Consumers by definition include us all. They are the largest economic group, affecting and affected by almost every public and private economic decision. Yet they are the only important group… whose views are often not heard.}}{{relevance inline|date=May 2014}}

[[File:Consumers International English Access to Knowledge 2008-2010.pdf|thumb|First two chapters of ''Access to Knowledge for Consumers'', a book from the Access to Knowledge campaign of Consumers International]]

Consumer rights activist [[Anwar Fazal]] working for Consumers International at the time, later proposed the observance of a 'World Consumer Rights Day' marking that date, and on 15 March 1983 consumer organisations started observing that date as an occasion to promote basic rights of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brobeck|first=Stephen|title=Encyclopedia of the consumer movement|year=1997|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Santa Barbara, Calif. [u.a.]|isbn=0874369878|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.consumersinternational.org/what-we-do/world-consumer-rights-day/ World Consumer Rights Day] is an annual occasion for celebration and solidarity within the international consumer movement. Participants observe the day by promoting the [[Human rights|basic rights]] of all consumers, demanding that those rights are respected and protected, and protesting about the market abuses and social injustices which undermine them.

World Consumer Rights Day is celebrated on 15 March every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Gallery.aspx?id=22_03_2016_007_007&amp;type=A&amp;eid=31808|title=The Times Group|website=epaperbeta.timesofindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The theme for 2018 is [http://www.consumersinternational.org/what-we-do/world-consumer-rights-day/2018-making-digital-marketplaces-fairer/ Fairer Digital Marketplaces]. Consumers International is calling for: 1. Access to fair and secure internet as half of the world is  still offline. 2. Action against scams and fraud. 3. Better general consumer protection online.

== Campaigns, projects and key issues ==
Consumers International seek to achieve changes in government policy and corporate behaviour, whilst raising awareness of consumer rights and responsibilities. Its campaigns often fall under the themes of consumer justice and protection, food policy, digital consumer rights and sustainability. Consumers International has campaigned on issues like junk [[food marketing]] and unethical drug promotion, corporate social responsibility and unethical or unsustainable behaviour by corporations and governments.

In 1979, IOCU (which then became Consumers International) and other citizens’ groups formed the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibfan.org/ibfan-gifa/100|title=IBFAN|website=ibfan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to eradicate the death and disease affecting millions of babies in economically developing countries as a result of consuming bottle-fed formula milk. After intense campaigning by IBFAN, including organising consumer boycotts against the likes of Nestlé,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babymilkaction.org/nestlefree|title=Nestlé boycott - Baby Milk Action|website=www.babymilkaction.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose subtle yet effective campaigns were undermining breast feeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/06/magazine/the-controversy-over-infant-formula.html?pagewanted=all|title=THE CONTROVERSY OVER INFANT FORMULA|first=Stephen|last=Solomon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the World Health Assembly of the World Health Organization, adopted the International Code of Marketing on Breast Milk Substitutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/code_english.pdf |title=CODE_E~1.DOC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first such code designed to control widespread marketing abuses by baby food companies.

In 1981, Consumers International co-founded the Health Action International (HAI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haiweb.org/history/ |title=History - Health Action International |publisher=Haiweb.org |date= |accessdate=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; an informal network of some 120 consumer and public interest groups, HAI engaged in worldwide campaigns for the safe, rational and economic use of pharmaceuticals. At the 41st World Health Assembly in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s21109en/s21109en.pdf |title=Info |website=apps.who.int |format=PDF}} &lt;/ref&gt; HAI organised a large lobby of delegates to urge stronger controls on advertising by the drugs industry.

A '''counterpart fund''' is a technique for turning [[foreign aid]] into reserves of domestic currency. They were used by the [[UNRRA]], and the [[Marshall Plan]] in the rebuilding of Western Europe after the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref&gt;Greg Behrman, The Marshal Plan, Aurum Press Ltd., 2008, pp. 178,179,232.&lt;/ref&gt; and today remain a common technique for delivering developmental assistance.

One method of setting up a counterpart fund is to have businesses in the country receiving aid that want to import a commodity place an order with their government and pays for the import in their local currency. The government then uses some of their foreign assistance, still in the foreign currency, to pay for the goods.  This makes importing far easier as the unstable currencies in developing nations are often of little international value. Agreements are also usually signed so that these imports can only come from the nation that gave the aid, benefiting the donor's export industry. Another method is for goods to be donated to a developing nation's government and for them to then sell the goods to the population, and use the proceeds to set up a fund.

The recipient government is also then left with the original payment in its domestic currency. These payments are amalgamated into a fund that is used to further fund development. This can take the form of investments in infrastructure or industry, paying down the debt or deficit, or stabilizing the currency. The investment of these funds can take the form of loans rather than grants, creating a permanent pool of investment capital. For instance, Germany's Marshall Plan counterpart funds were used to set up such an investment fund, and it is still in operation today.

==Example==

Suppose a German construction company wished to purchase an American crane for reconstruction efforts in 1949. In a counterpart fund arrangement, company would buy the crane from the West German government in [[Deutschmarks]], which would then be deposited into the central bank. The [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA), the body mediating counterpart funds, would pay the American crane exporter in dollars authorized under the [[European Recovery Program]] (ERP). Meanwhile, the Deutschmarks would be used to finance a ECA-approved recovery project.

There are several benefits to this transaction. First, instead of a direct transfer of an asset or converting currency for import, this system incentivizes participation in the economy using the local currency. For the construction company, the entire transaction occurred in West Germany and was arranged by the fledgling government. Furthermore, because the payment was in local currency, there is not a negative effect on West German balance of payments, which was a major concern of the ERP. Lastly, instead of resorting to inflationary policies as had often been done in post-war recoveries, the central bank had an inflow of currency to loan out for projects.&lt;ref name="Steil (2018)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steil|first1=Benn|title=The Marshall Plan: Dawn of the Cold War|date=2018|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9781501102370|pages=347-8|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Craft Identification Number''' ('''CIN''') or '''Hull Identification Number''' ('''HIN'''), standardised as '''EN ISO 10087:2006''', is a permanent unique fourteen-digit alphanumeric identifier issued to all marine vessels in Europe.  The numbering system is mandated by the European [[Recreational Craft Directive]] and descended from the [[American Ship Hull numbers|American Ship Hull number]] system.  Larger vessels over 300 [[gross tonnage|gross tonnes]] also receive a permanent international [[IMO ship identification number]], and European vessels over 20&amp;nbsp;metres receive a permanent [[ENI number]].

An example CID/HID might appear as "GB-ABC00042-A3-99", where "GB" is the [[ISO 3166-1]] country code, "ABC" would be the Acme Boat Company's '''Manufacturer Identity Code''' (MIC); "00042" would be the forty-second hull constructed by the organisation; "A3" would be January 2013 for the date [[keel laying|keel was laid]] to the nearest month and "99" denoted as the year 1999 as the particular model/specification number.&lt;ref name="bmf-rcd-cin"/&gt;  Months are denoted from A…L for January…December.

In the United Kingdom, the [[British Marine Federation]] manage the issuing of Manufacturer Identity Code on behalf of the British [[Department for Business Innovation and Skills]].&lt;ref name="bmf-rcd-cin"/&gt;  Amateur [[boat building|boat builders]] in the United Kingdom may apply for one-off HIN from the [[Royal Yacht Association]] who will issue one number from their "GB-RYAxxxxx" range.&lt;ref name="bmf-rcd-cin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmarine.co.uk/what_we_do/technical/recreational_craft_directive/craft_identification_number.aspx |title=Craft Identification Number |work=British Marine Federation website |author=British Marine Federation |authorlink=British Marine Federation |accessdate=18 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327000725/http://www.britishmarine.co.uk/what_we_do/technical/recreational_craft_directive/craft_identification_number.aspx |archivedate=27 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3365">'''Dipo''' is a [[Ghanaian]] traditional festival celebrated by the people of [[Odumase]] in the [[Central Region (Ghana)|Eastern region]] of [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name=Bak&gt;{{cite web|title=Festivals in Ghana|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/tourism/festivals.php|publisher=www.ghanaweb.com|accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is celebrated in the month of April every year.&lt;ref name=Bak/&gt; The festival is used to usher into puberty, girls who are virgins and it signifies that a lady, who partakes in it, is of age to be married.&lt;ref name="DIPO DISTRICT"&gt;{{cite web |title=Some festivals in Ghana |url=http://www.ghanadistricts.com/home/?_=33 |publisher=www.ghanadistricts.com |accessdate=28 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220062338/http://www.ghanadistricts.com/home/?_=33 |archivedate=20 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents upon hearing announcement of the rites send their qualified girls to the chief priest. However these girls would have to go through rituals and tests to prove their chastity before they qualify to partake in the festival.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.travel-to-discover-ghana.com/dipo-festival.html | title=dipo rite | accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first day of the rites, the girls have their heads shaved and dressed with cloth around their waist to just their knee level. This is done by a special ritual mother and it signifies their transition from childhood to adulthood.&lt;ref name="ccc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bradtghanaupdate.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/dipo-festival-of-the-krobo-somanya-odumasi/ | title=dipo festival | accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are paraded to the entire community as the initiates (dipo-yi).&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt;

Early the next morning, the chief priest gives the initiates a ritual bath. He pours libation to ask for blessings for the girls. He then washes their feet with the blood of a goat which their parents presented. This is to drive away any spirit of barrenness.&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt; The crucial part of the rite is when the girls sit on the sacred stone. This is to prove their virginity.&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://site.uit.no/ruhta/dipo/ | title=dipo | accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, any girl found to be pregnant or not a virgin is detested by the community and does not entice a man from the tribe.

The girls are then housed for a week, where they are given training on cooking, housekeeping, child birth and nurture. The ritual mothers give them special lessons on seduction and how to treat their husbands right. They learn the Klama dance which will be performed on the final day of the rites.&lt;ref name="ccc" /&gt;

After the one-week schooling, they are finally released and the entire community gather to celebrate their transition into womanhood. They are beautifully dressed in rich kente cloth accessorised with beads around their waist, neck and arms. With singing and drumming, they perform the Klama dance.&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt; At this point, any man interested in any one of them can start investigating into her family. 
it is assumed that any lady who partakes in the rites not only brings honour to herself but to her family at large.

It is made up by a metal bar (generally of iron) that is scraped by another metal object. The player holds the bar vertically, with its lower end in the palm of one hand and the upper end leaning against the shoulder. With the other hand, the player uses a metallic object, held horizontally, to scrape the bar with up-and-down movements. A custom-made ''ferrinho'' is usually 90 centimeters long, with a straight-angle section to ease handling.

The ''ferrinho'' is used to mark the rhythm in [[funaná]], a musical genre in [[Cape Verde]].

It is believed that the name “''ferrinho''” is an adaptation of “''ferrinhos''”, that is the name by which the [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] is known in popular music in Portugal. In spite of the name, the ferrinho is more similar to instruments like the ''[[güiro]]'' (scraped idiophone) than the triangle (directly struck idiophone).

==Musicians==
One of the greatest musicians who used the instrument is [[Codé di Dona]].  Other musicians with the instrument include Bino Branco from the band Ferro Gaita.

==Depictions==

In Sweden, a '''friggebod''' is a small house which can be built without any [[planning permission]] on a [[land lot]] with a single-family or a duplex house.  It is named after [[Birgit Friggebo]], who was the Minister for Housing in 1979 when the new type of building was allowed. The word is a [[portmanteau]] of Friggebo and ''bod'', the Swedish word for shed. 

==Restrictions==
Originally no more than 10 square metres, the maximum size was raised to 15 square metres in 2008. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.svd.se/bostad/folkets-bod-vaxer_1255111.svd | title=Folkets bod växer | work=Svenska Dagbladet | date=May 16, 2008 | accessdate=6 July 2014 | author=Kaasik, Helena}}&lt;/ref&gt; The friggebod regulations also allow the building of a [[Canopy (building)|canopy]] and a wall of wood or brick to protect a [[patio]]. The buildings do not have to follow the [[zoning]] regulations, but they have to comply with the [[building code]]  and cannot be built closer to a neighbour's land lot than 4.5 metres without that neighbour's permission. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.boverket.se/Global/Webbokhandel/Dokument/2014/Far-jag-bygga-juni-2014.pdf | title=Får jag bygga?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">The '''Færeyinga Saga''' ({{Audio|Is-Færeyinga saga.oga|listen}}), the [[saga]] of the [[Faroe Islands]], is the story of how the [[Faroe Islanders]] were converted to [[Christianity]] and became a part of [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.netcom.com/~kyamazak/myth/faroese/faereyinga-saga-origins-e.htm ''The History of the Making of the Saga'' (Faroese Ballads)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
It was written in [[Iceland]] shortly after 1200. The author is unknown and the original manuscript is lost to history, but passages of the original manuscript have been copied in other sagas, especially in three manuscripts: ''[[Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta]]'', ''[[Flateyjarbók]]'', and a manuscript registered as AM 62 fol.

The different sagas differ somewhat on the first settlement of the Faroes. Historians have understood from the beginning of ''Færeyinga Saga'' in ''Flateyjarbók'' that [[Grímur Kamban]] settled in the Faroes when [[Harald Fairhair]] was king of Norway (c.872-930 AD). This does not correspond with the writings of [[Dicuil]].

However, the version from ''Ólafs saga Tryggvasonar'' does correspond with the writings of Dicuil. The opening text is, "There was a man named Grímr Kamban; He first settled in Faroe. But in the days of Harold Fairhair many men fled before the king’s overbearing." The first man to settle in Faroe is, according to this text, a man with a [[Old Norse|Norse]] first name and a [[Goidelic languages |Gaelic]] last name. This suggests that he might have come from [[Norse–Gaels|Norse–Gael]] settlements to the south in [[Scotland]] or [[Ireland]] and probably wasn't [[Norwegians|Norwegian]].

The text says that many men fled from Norway when Harald Fairhair was king there, but it also says that the isles were settled before that (possibly for hundreds of years, although most historians do not think so).

The Norwegians who fled from Harald Fairhair must have known about the isles before leaving Norway. If Grímr Kamban settled some time before, this could explain the Norwegians knowing about the Faroes.

According to Dicuil, a [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]], the "[[Papar]]", lived in the Faroes (and [[Iceland]]) before [[Vikings]] came from Norway.

'''Hattie Carthan''' (1900–1984) was a [[activism|community activist]] and [[environmentalist]] who was instrumental in improving the [[quality of life]] of the [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] community of [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]].

Originally from [[Portsmouth, Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Olive, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E06E0DE1131E030AA5753C2A9639C946490D6CF "For a 'Tree Lady,' A City's 'Thank you'"], "The New York Times", May 20, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Carthan moved to the tree-lined block of Vernon Avenue between Tompkins Ave and Throop Ave in [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] in 1953, but by 1964, only three trees remained.&lt;ref&gt;Ferretti, Fred, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/08/garden/urban-conservation-a-one-woman-effort.html "Urban Conservation: A One-Woman Effort"], "The New York Times," July 8, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; She sent postcards to everyone on her block and formed the T &amp; T Vernon Avenue Block Association, which raised funds to buy and plant trees by throwing block parties.&lt;ref&gt;Carthan, Hattie, "Our Pleasure," Letter to "New York Amsterdam News," November 5, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;  The City of New York supported her efforts: Mayor [[John Lindsay]] attended one of the block parties, and the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|City Parks Department]] provided trees under its treematching program.  Eventually, Carthan would head the Bedford-Stuyvesant Beautification Committee.  She oversaw over 100 block associations which planted over 1,500 trees including those of the ginkgo, sycamore, and honeylocust varieties &lt;ref&gt;Ferretti, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/08/garden/urban-conservation-a-one-woman-effort.html "Urban Conservation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yonnette Fleming]] is the current Vice President of the Hattie Carthan Community Garden Farm. The farm was created to honor and continue the work of Hattie Carthan. 
Carthan spearheaded a campaign to save a 40-foot ''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'' tree that was thriving far north of its natural habitat, by getting it designated an official city living landmark. She went on to found the Magnolia Tree Earth Center, an educational center.

Carthan was survived by two sons, Reginald Hale of Newark and Malcolm Hale of Brooklyn; two sisters, Lottie Roundtree of Chesapeake, Va., and Alice Carper of Brooklyn; a brother, Dwight Lomax of Brooklyn, and three grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;Rule, Sheila, [https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/28/obituaries/hattie-carthan83proponent-of-trees-in-brooklyn-is-dead.html "Hattie Carthan, 83, Proponent of Trees in Brooklyn, Is Dead"], "The New York Times," April 28, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1954, IMV assembled cars by license from [[Austin (car)|Austin]] between 1967 and 1972.

'''Kazakhmys Corporation''' was a UK-registered copper mining company (as Kazakhmys PLC) whose main assets are located in [[Kazakhstan]]. Its headquarters are in Almaty and Astana in Kazakhstan. After 31 October 2014 the company is privately run by its owner Cuprum Holding. The headquarters of its main subsidiary, Kazakhmys Corporation, are located in Astana, Kazakhstan. Before October 2014 it was listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and was a constituent of the [[FTSE 250 Index]], also it was secondarily listed in [[Hong Kong]] in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mining-journal.com/finance/kazakhmys-chairman-sells-shares,-company-may-list-in-hong-kong

|title=Kazakhmys chairman sells shares, company may list in Hong Kong
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014 the company announced plans for major restructuring, and on 15 August 2014 independent shareholders of Kazakhmys PLC approved a major restructuring of the Group whereby Kazakhmys PLC disposed of a number of mature assets primarily in the Zhezkazgan and Central Regions to Cuprum Holding, a company whose principal shareholder is Vladimir Kim. The assets will be privately run under the name Kazakhmys Corporation with Eduard Ogay as a CEO. The restructuring was complete on 31 October 2014 and the Group de-merged into 2 separate independent companies: a private company Kazakhmys Corporation and a public company [[KAZ Minerals]] PLC.&lt;ref name="Kazakhmys Group Shareholder Circular 23 July 2014"&gt;[http://www.kazminerals.com/pdf/2014/Shareholder_Circular_English_2014.pdf Kazakhmys Group Shareholder Circular 23 July 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kazakhmys announcement on proposed Group restructuring 23 July 2014"&gt;[http://www.kazminerals.com/en/investors_media/news/press_release.jsp?id=1743 Kazakhmys announcement on proposed Group restructuring 23 July 2014], page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company's origins date back to 1930 when operations began at the [[Balkhash (city)|Balkhash]] copper smelting complex in [[Kazakhstan]]. The company operates 16 open pit and underground mines along with two smelting and refining plants in the Republic of Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.kazminerals.com/en/about_us/history Kazakhmys History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history 2"&gt;[http://www.stockmarketsreview.com/pricetargets/kazakhmys_report_maximising_efficiency_curbing_costs_20090903/ Kazakhmys profile and review]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[holding company]] of Kazakhmys group, Kazakhmys PLC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhmys PLC|url=http://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/default.aspx?Site=uk&amp;id=0P00007OIV&amp;LanguageId=en-GB|publisher=morningstar.co.uk|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in October 2005.

In August 2015 the Group's independent shareholders voted to approve the major restructuring as a result of which the Group de-merged into 2 separate independent companies: private company Kazakhmys Corporation with assets in Zhezkazgan and Balkhash regions run by Cuprum Holding, a company whose principal shareholder is Vladimir Kim, the CEO of Kazakhmys Corporation is Eduard Ogay; and a public company [[KAZ Minerals|KAZ Minerals PLC]].&lt;ref name="Kazakhmys Group Shareholder Circular 23 July 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kazakhmys announcement on proposed Group restructuring 23 July 2014"/&gt;

The '''''Ludus de Antichristo''''' (Play About the Antichrist) is a liturgical-oriented drama from the 12th century whose original author is unknown.  Its origins are almost certainly from southern [[Germany]], likely a product of the Benedictine monastery in [[Tegernsee]], [[Bavaria]]--as the manuscript that contains the play was kept at the monastery.  Most likely the play was written c. 1160 as much of the thematic material corresponds closely to events occurring during the reign of [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Frederick Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa I]] and his troubles with [[Pope Alexander III]]. A roughly seventy-line fragment of the play is also extant in a thirteenth-century Gospel text from the St. Georgenberg Abbey in modern-day Fiecht, Austria--suggesting a link between the two monastic communities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theatre-survey/article/medieval-space-early-medieval-documents-as-stages/D3FFBEDC8B6DE5F37E1ADB6DF4527D75&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the play is a critique of reform efforts instituted by the Papacy in the twelfth century that would potentially weaken monastic self-rule in favor of a more centralized Papal control over Christian instruction and education, specifically centered on the growth of cathedral schools. The monastery at Tegernsee had enjoyed suzerainty from Papal oversight since the tenth century--answering directly to the Holy Roman Emperor--and sought employ a propaganda effort amongst the many Benedictine communities in Bavaria and Austria in the form of a dramatic interpretation of eschatological events that were supportive of the Emperor as God's instrument in bringing about the final events Christian narrative, rather than those efforts of the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/30891/Thomas_Kyle.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; The long-standing designation of the play as a "liturgical" (dating back to the nineteenth century) is a result of the inclusion of several well-known liturgies popular amongst Benedictine monastic communities. But these liturgies reflect an "insider's knowledge" of their traditional means of performance, altering the reception of changes made by the author of the play so that the propagandistic messages are codified specifically for the monastic communities that surround Tegernsee. The drama warned its audience of the dangers posed by the [[Antichrist]], a prophesied figure of [[evil]] whose coming (according to the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s) was an indication that the end of the world, or [[apocalypse]], was near.

=== Formalised fighting over livestock or honour ===
In many cases there have been pitched battles between Massa from Cameroon and Massa from Chad. This clashes finish with many wounded. The battles are often caused by the theft of cows, because ''the importance of livestock in social relations'' and especially ''in marriage exchanges'' of the society, or by an act of adultery. Men who participate in them have helmets and clubs. They use sticks and stones as weapons and fight in lines while they are encouraged by women.&lt;ref name = ncbi /&gt;

In the battle between the two groups Massa, several rules must be met: collect the wounded from combat and not hit a man on the ground or who is wounded. The fighting must end at dusk. ''Injured people usually are cured by traditional [[Healer (alternative medicine)|healers]]'', who cure through several techniques which they exercise with local resources. Women who participate in this kind of fight  acquire prestige in Massa society.&lt;ref name = ncbi &gt; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17727041 NCBI: Pitched battle in Gueme between the Massa of Cameroon and Massa of Chad].

'''Mogersdorf''' ({{lang-hu|Nagyfalva}}, {{lang-sl|Modinci}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makuc|first1=Neva|title=Historiografija in mentaliteta v novoveški Furlaniji in Goriški|date=2011|publisher=Založba ZRC|location=Ljubljana|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a town in the district of [[Jennersdorf (district)|Jennersdorf]] in the [[Austria]]n state of [[Burgenland]].

==History==
Mogersdorf has a famous place in Austrian history because it was here that [[Raimondo Montecuccoli]] annihilated a 60,000/90,000-strong army of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1664 upon its attempt to cross the [[Rába|Raab River]] westwards towards Styria. This Battle of Mogersdorf (also known as the [[Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664)|First Battle of St. Gotthard]]) was commemorated by a chapel on the nearby Schlößlberg hill. Having fallen into disrepair, it was replaced by a new building, with an unadorned but huge [[Christian cross]] at its side, in 1964.

'''Mountain Wilderness''' is an international [[NGO|non-governmental organization]] dedicated to the preservation of mountain areas, in their natural and cultural aspects. The organization was founded in Europe and has a stronger presence in [[Alps|alpine]] and [[Pyrenees|pyrenean]] regions. It has, however, a worldwide reach, with representatives and actions on all continents.

==Objectives==
Mountain Wilderness shares some of the values and objectives of [[Alpine Club|alpine clubs]] and environmentalist organizations, but is clearly distinct from both. Mountain Wilderness was founded by [[mountaineering|mountaineers]] and places a stronger emphasis on the ''human experience of wilderness'' than on the exclusive defense of [[wildlife]] for its own sake.
Even in the most remote mountain regions, there remain vanishingly few untouched [[wilderness]] zones in a strict sense. Contrary to what a literal interpretation would suggest, Mountain Wilderness does not focus on such "pure", pristine wilderness. Nearly all mountain landscapes, and, to an even higher degree, the perception of mountains by humans, bear a strong cultural imprint. Mountain Wilderness works towards the inclusive preservation of this natural and cultural mountain environment at large, in three complementary ways :
*by furthering activities and practices that foster self-reliance, respect for nature and the shared enjoyment of mountains by all those who love them
*by opposing aggressive activities, such as recreational [[off-roading]], [[snowmobiling]], [[heli-skiing]], and more generally the [[commercialization]], [[overdevelopment]] and exclusive appropriation of mountains by those who just want to exploit them.
*by fostering a naturally and culturally respectful development of mountain regions, to ensure a [[sustainability|sustainable]]  future for those who choose to live there

==History==
Mountain Wilderness was founded in 1987 in [[Biella]], Italy during an international conference convened by Ludovico Sella, scion of a prominent [[piedmont]]ese family of financiers, statesmen and mountaineers, among which [[Quintino Sella]], the 19th century founder of the Italian Alpine Club.
This conference was a follow-up to a similar gathering of mountaineers convened by the Italian Academic Alpine Club on 8 August 1986, on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the first ascent of the [[Mont-Blanc]]. On this occasion, a “manifesto for Mont Blanc” was issued and signed by a number of renowned mountaineers, among which Sir [[Chris Bonington]], [[Yvon Chouinard]], [[Reinhold Messner]], [[Doug Scott]]. This manifesto called for a foundational human right to “open spaces for free adventure”.
The Biella conference attracted a larger attendance of mountaineers and intellectuals from all over the world, several of whom were to become founding guarantors and founding members of Mountain Wilderness. Among them were [[Haroun Tazieff]], [[Kurt Diemberger]], [[Jim Bridwell]], [[John Hunt, Baron Hunt|John Hunt]], [[Wanda Rutkiewicz]]. The "Biella theses",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountainwilderness.fr/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=369&amp;Itemid=123 Theses de Biella (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; on which the above mission statement is based, were written during this meeting.

==Actions==

Some of the actions led by Mountain Wilderness at the international level have been:
*Demonstration at Pointe Helbronner on 16 August 1986, against the [[Vallee Blanche Aerial Tramway]], a [[gondola lift]] that crosses the “Vallée Blanche” from [[Aiguille du Midi]] to the col du Géant above [[Courmayeur]], desecrating the very heart of the [[Mont Blanc]] massif, a wilderness area of foremost symbolic and cultural significance for Europe. During this demonstration, [[Reinhold Messner]] climbed atop one of the gondola towers to hang a protest banner.
Although Mountain Wilderness had yet to be formally established as an organization when this took place, it was later perceived as an inaugural event. The daring, spectacular character of this action inspired comparisons to similar actions by [[Greenpeace]], but later demonstrations by Mountain Wilderness have generally been more modest. All have been peaceful and none of them against the law.
*“Free K2” expedition organised in 1990 on [[K2]], the second highest mountain in the word, to remove fixed ropes and discarded gear left behind by all expeditions that had attempted the ascent.
*Campaign to protect [[Mount Olympus]] in Greece from a huge development project. A manifesto was issued at the end of 1993 and an international petition was signed by intellectuals and writers from all over the world, among which five Nobel laureates. The project was withdrawn in 1995, after this petition was delivered to the Greek government.
*Oxus, mountains for peace, an expedition organised to climb Mount [[Noshaq]], the highest peak in [[Afghanistan]], in the [[Wakhan Corridor]] and the [[Hindu Kush]] range, in 2003: this event was intended to promote sustainable outdoor tourism in this country and to serve as a symbol of a possible return to peace and normalcy, after the civil war and the fall of the [[Taliban]] regime, during which all manner of tourism had completely disappeared.

==Guarantors==

Guarantors of Mountain Wilderness are a group of intellectuals, writers, mountaineers, world-travelers, who are recognized through their achievements and their long-time commitment to the shared values of Mountain Wilderness. They play the roles of international representatives and advisors for the association.

The guarantors elected at the last General Assembly that took place in Biella, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the foundation of Mountain Wilderness (2008-04-12) are :
Bernard Amy (FR), Núria Balagué (CT), Bernard Batschelet (CH), Edwin Bernbaum (US), Andrea Bianchi (CH), Sir [[Chris Bonington]] (UK), Fausto De Stefani (IT), Kurt Diemberger (AT), Patrick Gabarrou (FR) (currently international coordinator), Maurizio Giordani (IT), Richard Goedeke (DE), Alessandro Gogna (IT), Paulo Grobel (FR), Victor Groselj (SL), François Labande (FR), Franco Michieli (IT), Nicole Niquille (CH), Olivier Paulin (FR), Carlo Alberto Pinelli (IT) (former international coordinator), Jordi Quera (CT), Ludovico Sella (IT),  Josep Sicart (CT), Patrick Wagnon (FR).

Among noted former guarantors are :
[[Sir Edmund Hillary]] (NZ) (who was long-time honorary president of Mountain Wilderness, now succeeded by Sir Chris Bonington), [[John Hunt, Baron Hunt|John Hunt]] (UK), [[Reinhold Messner]] (IT),  [[Jean-Christophe Lafaille]] (FR), [[Haroun Tazieff]] (FR), [[Wanda Rutkiewicz]] (PL), [[Jim Bridwell]] (US).

'''Old Palapye''' is a heritage site located in [[Botswana]], near a town called Palapye. Old Palapye and Palapye are two different places according to the residents there, [[Palapye]] is a modernised town. The site is located 20 km away from the [[Palapye]] town and the people living around call it [[Malaka village]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Palapye monument|url=http://www.knowbotswana.com/old-palapye.html|website=Know Botswana|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This monument site is called Old Palapye because it carries the history of the ancient nature which differentiates it from the Palapye town.

Old Palapye is a crucial site which has many artifacts in it from the middle, late and stone age history. Old Palapye became famous because the remains of the [[Ngwato]] capital which was found in the year 1889 during the ruling of the famous [[Kgosi Khama III]] from 1889-1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic sites Botswana|url=http://www.knowbotswana.com/old-palapye.html|website=Know Botswana|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kgosi Khama III initially lived in a village called [[Shoshong]] village and later moved to Old Palapye because of shortage of water in [[Shoshong]].He later moved to [[Serowe]] due to the same reason he moved from [[Shoshong]]. The attraction to the monument includes the perennial spring and water falls, stone remains of roundavels and rock paintings.

{{Quote box
|quote  = Russia has made its choice in favor of democracy. Fourteen years ago, independently, without any pressure from outside, it made that decision in the interests of itself and interests of its people&amp;nbsp;— of its citizens. This is our final choice, and we have no way back. There can be no return to what we used to have before. And the guarantee for this is the choice of the Russian people, themselves. No, guarantees from outside cannot be provided. This is impossible. It would be impossible for Russia today. Any kind of turn towards totalitarianism for Russia would be impossible, due to the condition of the Russian society.

The '''Populist Party''' ({{lang-tr|Halkçı Parti}}) was a left-wing political party in [[Northern Cyprus]] between 1975 and 1981.

==History==
The party was established in 1975 by [[Alper Orhon]], and won two seats in the [[Northern Cyprus parliamentary election, 1976|1976 elections]].&lt;ref name=VM&gt;Vincent E McHale (1983) ''Political parties of Europe'', Greenwood Press, p122 {{ISBN|0-313-23804-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the following year one of its two MPs defected to the [[Communal Liberation Party]]. In 1981 it merged into the [[Democratic People's Party (Northern Cyprus)|Democratic People's Party]].&lt;ref name=VM/&gt;

==Ideology==
The party had [[social democratic]] principles, and was considered to be a Cypriot version of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] in Turkey.&lt;ref name=VM/&gt; It was critical of the [[National Unity Party (Northern Cyprus)|National Unity Party]] government's handling of economic affairs, particularly the dependence on Turkey for economic development. It supported government-run enterprises and the participation of workers in planning.&lt;ref&gt;McHale, p123&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Republican Party of Moldova''' ({{lang-ro|Partidul Republican din Moldova}}) is a political party in [[Moldova]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parties.e-democracy.md/en/parties/prm/ Republican Party of Moldova]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Republican Party of Moldova (RPM) was established on August 15, 1999. The Founding Congress adopted the party program and bylaws and elected the governing bodies, including the Party Chairperson, Ion Curtean.

In the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, April 2009|April 5, 2009 legislative elections]], it did not pass the election threshold as it polled 0.09% of the vote. Before the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, July 2009|early parliamentary elections of July 29, 2009]], it withdrew from the race and campaigned for the [[Democratic Party of Moldova]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/en/story/13041 Andrei Stratan becomes chairman of Republican Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration (Moldova)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Andrei Stratan]] was elected leader of the Republican Party at the August 1, 2010 congress of the party by a unanimous vote. The party's former chairman Ion Curtean and vice chairman Valerian Hortolomei remained to work as part of the party, but it is not yet known what posts they will hold.

The [[Central Election Commission of Moldova]] registered the partyas a participant in the campaign for the [[Moldovan constitutional referendum, 2010|September 5 constitutional referendum]]. The party will campaign in favor of the referendum and urge the people to vote for amending Article 78 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/en/story/13041 Andrei Stratan becomes chairman of Republican Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Single cable distribution''' is a [[satellite TV]] technology that enables the delivery of broadcast programming to multiple users over a single coaxial cable, and eliminates the numerous cables required to support consumer electronics devices such as twin-tuner [[Digital Video Recorders]] (DVRs) and high end receivers.

Without single cable distribution, providing full spectrum access for multiple receivers, or receivers with multiple tuners, in a single family home has required a separate coaxial cable feeding each tuner from the antenna equipment (either multiple [[Low-noise block converter|LNB]]s, a multi-output LNB or a multiswitch distribution system) because of the large bandwidth requirement of the signals.

Single cable distribution technology enables one coaxial cable from the antenna equipment to multiple tuners, to provide independent tuning across the whole range of satellite reception for each tuner.&lt;ref&gt;SES ASTRA "Single Cable Distribution" (August, 2008). Company factsheet&lt;/ref&gt;

A European industry standard for distributing satellite signals over a single coaxial cable - CENELEC EN50494 - has been defined in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=BS+EN+50494%3a2007 ansi.org - BS EN 50494:2007 Satellite signal distribution over a single coaxial cable in single dwelling installations (British Standard)] $257 read 2012-06-29&lt;/ref&gt; and developed by a consortium led by [[SES S.A.|SES]].

Single cable distribution technology can be found in commercial equipment with the Unicable trademark from FTA Communications Technologies. Unicable uses an integrated software and hardware solution that allows Unicable-certified Digital Video Recorders and receivers to multiplex selected programming when using Unicable LNB or multiswitching products.

The Unicable Interoperability Platform is open to companies designing and/or marketing satellite and other broadcast-related products. The platform is designed to facilitate the acceptance of Unicable-certified solutions in the consumer TV broadcast market.

== How it works ==
Each satellite receiver in the installation has a dedicated user band of a [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] approximately the same as a [[transponder]]. The receiver requests a particular transponder frequency via a [[DiSEqC]]-compliant command. A [[electronic mixer|mixer]] in the dish-end equipment (an LNB or distribution unit) converts the received signal to the correct user band [[intermediate frequency|IF]] centre frequency for that receiver.&lt;ref&gt;Bains, Geoff. "Inverto Unicable LNB" ''What Satellite &amp; Digital TV'' (February, 2006) pp60-62&lt;/ref&gt;

The converted transponders of the various users are then combined, and sent via the single coaxial cable to the receivers. The combined signal is tapped or split to reach every user.

Silicon vendors have developed complex Integrated Circuits that greatly reduce the cost of implementing the single cable distribution function.  A Channel Stacking Switch IC is a multiple-input multiple-output device. It typically has N {{nowrap|1.2 GHz}} inputs that can be cascaded to additional chips as required (to expand output capacity). These inputs are fed into a large N-pole M-Throw switch that outputs to {{nowrap|M mixers}}. Each mixer path then translates only the user requested transponder to a predetermined fixed frequency within the {{nowrap|950-2150 MHz}} band. This fixed frequency is unique for each tuner on the single cable output. Each tuner in the STB always stays at this fixed frequency while the CSS IC translates the user requested content down the cable to this exact frequency. This architecture requires no hardware change to the STB design. Communications protocol between the CSS IC and the STB is handled via the CENELEC EN50494 standard or proprietary systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entropic.com/briefs/DBSdelivery.pdf ENTROPIC] - Single Cable Distribution White Paper, Brandon, Troy. "Changing DBS Delivery - The Single Wire Solution" (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment==
Special LNBs have been developed for use in single cable distribution systems. All four sub-bands of the [[Ku band]] (low frequency/horizontal polarity, high frequency/horizontal polarity, low frequency/vertical polarity, high frequency/vertical polarity) are received by a conventional front end, amplified and downconverted to the L-band, to be fed to a number of SatCR (Satellite Channel Router) – one for each user that can be connected - to further downconvert the required section of the received spectrum to centre on the user band IF frequency.
The LNB further includes a combiner (i.e. reverse splitter) to merge the user bands together and a microcontroller to receive the instructions as to which frequency is required by each user and control the SatCR chips.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mvisata.lt/files/Unicable_datasheet.pdf|title=One Cable For All Your Digital Needs |publisher=FTA Communications Technologies. Company factsheet |accessdate=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a single cable distribution system can use a conventional LNB feeding the four sub-bands to a separate SatCR receivers, as a substitute for a traditional multiswitch, that needs a dedicated coaxial cable for every receiver (or tuner) connected.

Unicable LNBs and SatCRs also usually include either a legacy mode of operation or a legacy output which provides conventional LNB IF for use with an installation of non-Unicable receivers.

A receiver required to operate in a single cable distribution installation can be essentially conventional. It should be able to tune to the user channel (within the normal IF tuning range) and modulate the LNB power voltage with the 22&amp;nbsp;kHz signal required for issuing DiSEqC commands. It will then require only software modification to operate as a single cable distribution receiver.

For correct operation, two-way splitters are required to feed the combined signal to each receiver. These allow bi-directional passage of both RF and DC signals, to provide for the passing of DiSEqC commands between the LNB and receiver(s).

As of March 2010, SES' Single Cable Distribution factsheet lists 88 receivers as supporting single cable distribution technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ses-astra.com/resources/pdf/en-shared/products_services/0_Single_Cable_Distribution_brochure.pdf
|title=Single Cable Distribution |publisher=SES Astra. Company factsheet |accessdate=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this list is not exhaustive. Several receivers for the [[HD+]] German high definition platform broadcast from [[Astra 19.2°E]] are compatible with the SatCR system.

==Use in legacy communal TV systems ==
Existing communal [[integrated reception system]]s (IRS) often provide only one satellite feed to each household, preventing the use of dual-tuner DVRs. Upgrading the [[multiswitch]]es and cabling to provide two or more feeds per household is usually both costly and invasive. However, individual households or sections of the system can be converted to SatCR distribution so that multiple tuners within a household can be fed via the single existing coaxial cable.

Equipment such as Inverto’s Unicable Cascadable Switch can be connected to a conventional [[Low-noise block converter#Dual.2FQuad.2FQuattro.2FOcto LNBs|quattro LNB]] to provide a single SatCR output and a conventional LNB output. The four IF inputs from the Quattro LNB are looped through to outputs so the unit can be cascaded to further SatCR switches or to the existing multiswitches of the IRS, so an SatCR-enabled output is provided without replacing the existing LNB or affecting the provision for conventional receivers in other households served by the rest of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inverto.tv/products/product.php?section=3&amp;id=190 |title=Unicable cascadable switch 4 User Bands,and 1 Legacy port 
|publisher= Inverto | accessdate=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of the Unicable Switch to provide for four and eight tuners within a household are available, and to combine a digital terrestrial signal onto the SatCR-enabled output as well.

Global Invacom’s SatCR Adaptor unit performs a similar function but is connected to the existing multiswitch outputs, to provide SatCR compatibility for one connection (one household) of an existing IRS.

The SatCR Adaptor connects to four outputs of an IRS multiswitch and provides a single SatCR output that is typically connected to the existing single coaxial cable to the household to be converted. A further four conventional IF outputs are provided to recover usage of the existing multiswitch outputs for other households. Within the SatCR enabled household, a splitter and power injector provides power to the SatCR Adaptor and splits the signal to feed the separate tuners connected.

Global Invacom developed the SatCR Adaptor in conjunction with [[BSkyB]] to enable flats and homes with single-feed distribution systems to fit [[Sky+]] and [[Sky+ HD]] dual-tuner DVR receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalinvacom.com/products/pdfs/SCR%20iss4.pdf |title=SCR Adaptor |publisher= Global Invacom | accessdate=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While BSkyB SCR is slightly different to the CENELEC EN50494 standard most European SCR compatible multiswitches support both standard and BSkyB modes. Most Sky branded receivers including the Sky Q model can be used on SatCR systems by enabling a hidden option. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitrongroup.com/download.php?lang=en&amp;id=657&lt;/ref&gt; Sky Italia receivers comply with the unicable standard.

==Fibre-optic alternative==
An alternative approach to that provided by single cable distribution of the signal from a single LNB to multiple receivers, or receivers with multiple tuners, is offered by the use of [[fibre satellite distribution]] using [[optical fibre]]. The high bandwidth of optical connections allows for the full satellite spectrum received at the dish to be accommodated on one fibre optic cable, which can be easily optically split to provide that full spectrum signal to a large number of receivers.

UK company Global Invacom (which also developed and markets SatCR single cable distribution equipment) has developed a low cost system of fibre optic distribution suitable for domestic installations and small or medium commercial communal dish systems, with an optical output LNB, fibre cables, splitters, and converter units to return the optical signal to an electrical one compatible with legacy receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalinvacom.com/products/fibremdu-virtual-converters.php |title=Fibre optic distribution products information |publisher= Global Invacom | accessdate=November 78, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extremely low signal loss through fibre optic cables and complete elimination of interference and noise picked up by the cable mean that such a system can support very long cable runs between the dish and the converters in a widespread communal dish system, and a smaller dish can be used as the communal antenna.

Global Invacom won the Astra Innovation Contest run by satellite operator [[SES S.A.|SES]] in 2007 for the proposal and initial development of optical fibre distribution systems for satellite TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES ASTRA |date=September 28, 2007 |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2007/4434481|title= Global Communications, Invacom, And Era Technology Winners of the SES ASTRA Innovation Contest |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soft balancing''' is a recent addition to [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power theory]] used to describe non-military forms of [[balancing in international relations|balancing]] evident since the end of the [[Cold War]], particularly during and after the 2003 [[Iraq War]]. Soft balancing as a strategy can be attributed to the work of [[Robert Pape]]&lt;ref&gt;“Soft Balancing against the United States,” ''International Security'', 30/1, (Summer 2005): p 7-45.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[T. V. Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;“Soft Balancing in the Age of US Primacy,” ''International Security'', 30/1, (Summer 2005): p 46-71.&lt;/ref&gt; It was criticized by [[Stephen Brooks (academic)|Stephen Brooks]] and [[William Wohlforth]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G. Brooks &amp; William C. Wohlforth, "Hard Times for Soft Balancing", ''International Security'', 30/1, (Summer 2005): p 72–108.&lt;/ref&gt;. Soft balancing has been practiced in many developing countries such as Brazil, India, South Africa, etc. Most countries share the common denominator of not having a strong military force, thus, them utilizing internal force rather than aggressive force. 

Soft balancing occurs when weaker states decide that the dominance and influence of a stronger state is unacceptable, but that the military advantage of the stronger state is so overwhelming that traditional balancing is infeasible or even impossible.  In addition to overwhelming military superiority, scholars also suggest that [[democratic peace theory]] suggests a preference toward soft, rather than hard, balancing among democracies.

As opposed to traditional balancing, soft balancing is undertaken not to physically shift the balance of power but to undermine, frustrate, and increase the cost of unilateral action for the stronger state.  Soft balancing is not undertaken via military effort, but via a combination of economic, diplomatic and institutional methods. In other words, soft balancing uses "non-military tools to delay, frustrate and undermine aggressive unilateral U.S. military policies".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Anthony Pape. "Soft Balancing against the United States" in ''International Security'', Volume 30, Number 1, Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Being non-military, soft balancing is regarded as ineffective: “Soft” balancing is “balancing that does not balance at all.”&lt;ref&gt; Thomas S. Mowle &amp; David H., Sacko,''The Unipolar World: An Unbalanced Future'', (New York: Macmillan, 2007), p 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft balancing is contrasted with [[balancing in international relations|hard balancing]] and [[bandwagoning]].

'''Telstar 301''' is an [[United States|American]] communications satellite launched in July 1983 and operated by AT&amp;T.  It was one of three [[Telstar]] 3 satellites, followed by [[Telstar 302]] in 1984 and [[Telstar 303]] in 1985.

The satellite served as the east coast home satellite for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]] from 1984 to 1993.  The [[CBS]] network also used the satellite from 1985 to 1993.  It also served as the first home of [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] until the late 1980s.

Other entities that also used the satellite included [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]], Wold/Keystone Communications (which used the satellite to feed [[Paramount Television]]'s syndicated output including ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''), Compact Video, [[Lorimar-Telepictures]], and [[Warner Bros. Television]].

The satellite was retired in 1993 and replaced by [[Telstar 401]].&lt;ref&gt;
http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/telstar-4.htm
&lt;/ref&gt;  As of June 2009, Telstar 301 (along with Telstar 302 and Telstar 303) was still in orbit.

 |ShortSummary    = In 1415's France, Montmorency and his friends Richemont, Charlotte and Philippe are students of Paris' Knights School. However, Montmorency is more interested in alchemic studies, and his dream is to unveil the true power of the Philosophers' Stone that his ancestors bought back from the Holy Land during the last crusade. Meanwhile, France and England are fighting one against the other during the Hundred Years War, and soon every household serving the King of France is called to arms to protect Paris from the enemy. Before departing, the four friends swear to remain together till their last breath and do their best to end the war, but a few time later the French Army faces a dramatic defeat in Azincourt, and the same Richemont is apparently killed during the battle. Seeing his remaining friends leaving his side (Charlotte is called back to her castle, since her brothers' death has made her the heir to the throne, while Philippe's Household surrenders the Burgundy to the English), Montmorency desperately performs a ritual to call a demon capable to make him able to find out the secret of the stone in exchange for his soul, calling the Queen of the Fairies Astaroth in the human world. Astaroth teaches Montmorency how to create the Elixir, which power will allow him to swallow the stone and gain his power becoming an Ulysses. However something goes wrong, and due to an unexpected side-effect at the end of the ritual Montmorency discovers that seven years has passed meanwhile.

 |ShortSummary    = Montmorency starts traveling around France, alongside Astaroth in search of a way to complete the ritual and become a Ulysses. One day, his never ending voyage leads him to the small village of Domremy where he meets Jeanne, a twelve-year-old little girl with a kind and pure heart. Meanwhile, the English army has conquered most of Northern France, and Lorraine is about to fall; because of this, Princess Charlotte sends the mercenary commander La Hire and her soldiers to protect the people. Meanwhile in Domremy, Montmorency discovers from Astaroth that the ritual has made his body capable of producing an endless amount of elixir, however due to this he's no more able to swallow the stone, since the elixir in his body could easily send it to berserk and kill him. Unfortunately, the English forces arrive sooner than expected, and there are too many for La Hire's army to defeat them. During the battle, Jeanne is deadly wounded after seeing her friendly fairies brutally killed by the English, and to save her life Montmorency decides to perform a ritual on her, inserting half of the stone in Jeanne's body. The ritual saves Jeanne and makes her a Ulysses, but also turns her into a brutal and ruthless fighter.  Jeanne then defeats the English foreces and almost kills La Hire for her being jealous of the size of her breasts. Fortunately, the power of the stone stops at the right moment, proving that Jeanne can only become a Ulysses just for three minutes. At that point, knowing that she can no more remain in Domremy, Jeanne chooses to depart with La Hire and Montmorency. La Hire fears that as the voices of Jeanne's power will start spreading she'll be marked as an heretic and hunted by the Inquisition, but Montmorency objects that on contrary she'll become the holy saint that will repel the English and save France.

 |ShortSummary    = Montmorency starts spreading rumors about Jeanne's supposed holiness, claiming that she's the legendary virgin chosen by God to protect France from evil named in some old legends. When voices start spreading, Montmorency and Jeanne go to [[Château de Chinon|Chinon]] to speak with Charlotte herself and ask her to make Jeanne a knight and a commander of the French army. Thinking that Jeanne is just yet another charlatan in search for money, Charlotte tries to mock her by switching her place on the throne with a maid during a party, but with Astaroth's help Jeanne finds out the trick gaining even more consideration. In a second time, Jeanne saves Charlotte from an assassination attempt, but at the end of the battle a mysterious man named Girald appears from nowhere saying that the assassin's true objective was to make Jeanne weak enough to claim the Philosopher's Stone. Meanwhile, Montmorency is captured by La Tremoille, his own cousin and one of Charlotte's advisor, which captures Astaroth too, and thrown in the castle's underground. In prison, he finds Richemont, that tells him how after the Battle of Azincourt she had chosen to swear her loyalty to [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], hoping to gain enough consideration in both kingdoms to negotiate the end of the war; however, after Henry's death, she had deserted again due to his [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|brother]]'s sinister ego, but once returned to France she was branded as a traitor and jailed.

However, before Montmorency and Richemont can be killed, La Hire and her mercenaries attack the castle and save them. Montmorency and the others then try to save Jeanne and Charlotte from Girald, which threatens Jeanne's life to force Montmorency to surrender his half of the stone; however, Montmorency succeeds in tricking him, and Girald dies after having swallowed the stone without the elixir's protection. Once the battle is over, Montmorency tries to pursue Philippe to swear her loyalty to the Valois, reuniting France against the English; Philippe however refuses, claiming that Girald was following her orders to claim the stone in order to fulfill her deceased father's last wish to make her family the next rulers of France, and leaves the castle after having stolen some elixir by kissing Montmorency. Despite this, Charlotte decides to finally take the fate of the nation in her hands, and in front of the entire court she makes Jeanne a knight and the commander of the French Army, with Montmorency as her second-in-command. However, La Tremoille manages to escape, searching the Inquisition's help to discredit Jeanne's holyness and get his vengeance.

Since Charlotte has not enough soldiers to send at Orléans' aid, Richemont tries to search for her [[John V, Duke of Brittany|weak brother]]'s help, only to find out that he has no intention to side nor with the English or the French until the war will be over. Meanwhile, La Trémoille returns to Chinon with a letter of the Inquisition, which requires to make a virginity test to Jeanne to prove that she has not copulated with the Devil to gain her powers; however, Charlotte and Montmorency refuse to give their authorization to the test, fearing that the Inquisition might probably use any sort of trick to demonstrate its theory. Plus this, due to a discussion with Charlotte, Richemont decides to resign from her role of knight and leaves the castle for an unknown route. At the end, La Trémoille successfully moves the people of Chinon to attack the castle to force Charlotte authorizing the test; Montmorency and Astaroth try to calm the crowd, but at the end they're both saved by Jeanne, which uses the power of the ancient sword Joyouse to become an Ulysses in front of everyone: like this, everyone recognize her as a Saint, leading to a mass recruitment that recreates the French army in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, in Burgundy, Philippe wears an ancient cursed helmet, using Montmorency's elixir to turn into a Dark Ulysses.

 |ShortSummary    = Jeanne and Montmorency successfully reach the sieged Orléans, whose army is commanded by Richemont's younger brother Alençon and Charlotte's illegitimate cousin, Batard. Alençon however initially refuses the newcomers' help and launches a frontal assault of his own, but he's seriously wounded by Philippe. Jeanne and Montmorency face Philippe and defeat her, forcing the girl to retreat and assuring a successful withdrawal for their allies into the city. Despite this, thanks to Jeanne's influence the French army reconquers most of the castles and fortresses around Orléans, moving Bedford to hire the English mercenary and Ulysses Hunter Gladsale, who sides with Philippe to counter the Pucelle's power. However, Jeanne's supporters quickly get out of control, and even with the girl's insistence (provoked by the fact that the stone is starting to change her personality even out of her Ulysses form) Alençon has no choice but attack the powerful stronghold of Les Tourelles, located on the other side of the bridge that passes over the [[Loire]] and connects Orléans with the southern bank. During the battle, however, Jeanne is tricked by Philippe, who successfully blocks her allowing Glasdale to pierce both their hearts with an arrow made from the [[Lance of Longinus]], another powerful Philosopher's Stone with the power of preventing pierced organs from healing. Jeanne's defeat quickly demoralizes the French army, which retreats almost immediately, even as Alençon succeeds in stopping the English from claiming Pucelle's body.

 |ShortSummary    = The French army regroups at the Augustines, an old monastery now turned into a fortress close to Les Tourelles, but Jeanne is now in a comatose state for having lost her heart, with the Stone barely able to keep her alive. Astaroth tells Montmorency that the only way to save her is with Excalibur, another ancient Philosopher's Stone with the power of healing any wound. Since the sword is said to be located in Montmorency's native land Brittany, Alençon requires him on this occasion to reach his grandfather Jean de Craon and ask him for soldiers to sustain the battle. Despite the hate between him and his grandfather, Montmorency travels to Champtocé and speaks with Jean, who however answers that he'll lend him soldiers only if Montmorency agrees to marry his own cousin Catherine de Thouars, uniting the two most powerful households in Brittany. Montmorency initially refuses to not break his oath to stay alongside Jeanne without marrying, but Catherine, despite her love for him, agrees to make Jean de Craon believe that they had made love during the night; in this way, Montmorency's grandfather agrees to lend him the soldiers he wants, despite having learned from his old friend [[Nicolas Flamel|Flamel]] that his grandson may be the legendary Antichrist that will end the world. Meanwhile, La Hire's unit is sent to Orléans to assist Alençon, and Philippe too is able to reawaken thanks to the helmet's healing abilities.

 |ShortSummary    = While La Hire and Xaintrailles protect Orléans, Astaroth leads Alençon and Batard to the place where she had hidden Excalibur's scabbard, revealing to be the legendary [[Lady of the Lake]] that retrieved the sword after the death of King Arthur. Once reached the hideout with the help of some fairies, however, the group encounters the Welsh writer and novelist [[Thomas Malory]], which tries to steal the scabbard by Bedford's order; Astaroth however manages do retrieve it, and in order to counter the arriving English army Alençon orders to Batard and Astaroth to return in Orléans while he will stay back to fight, keeping Malory with him as an hostage. Fortunately, Richemont's army arrives just in time to save Alençon (even if Malory manages to escape), then brother and sister head to the road between Champtocé and Orléans, where La Tremoille is trying to stop Montmorency's troops with his own personal army. While Richemont keeps La Tremoille occupied, Montmorency and Alençon finally reaches the Augustines, where thanks to the scabbard and Montomorency's kiss Jeanne successfully heals and wakes up.
