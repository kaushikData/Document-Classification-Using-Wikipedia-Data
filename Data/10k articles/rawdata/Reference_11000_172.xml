      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15453">'''3DMark''' is a [[computer benchmark]]ing tool created and developed by [[UL (safety organization)|UL]], (formerly [[Futuremark]]), to determine the  [[Performance test (assessment)|performance]] of a computer's 3D graphic rendering and CPU workload processing capabilities. Running 3DMark produces a 3DMark score, with higher numbers indicating better performance. The 3DMark measurement unit is intended to give a normalized mean for comparing different PC hardware configurations (mostly [[GPU|graphics processing unit]]s and [[CPU|central processing unit]]s), which proponents such as gamers and [[overclocking]] enthusiasts assert is indicative of end-user performance capabilities. 

Many versions of 3DMark have been released since 1998. Scores cannot be compared across versions as each test is based on a specific version of the [[DirectX]] [[application programming interface|API]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremark.com/benchmarks/3dmarkvantage/whatis3dmark/|title=What is 3DMark?|work=Futuremark Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| 3DMark03 || The fourth generation 3DMark. It is the first version that supports Microsoft DirectX 9.0 and introduces several new features.  The graphics tests cover a range of rendering techniques and DirectX 9 features, expanding on a similar system used in 3DMark2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremark.com/pressroom/pressreleases/20386/|title=3DMark03 Released|date=2003-02-11|work=Futuremark Corporation|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3DMark03 does not use a 3rd party engine for any of the tests; light DirectX wrappers are used instead.
The final score is a [[weighted sum]] of the game tests. The results of CPU and other tests are not taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremark.com/pressroom/companypdfs/3dmark03_whitepaper.pdf|title=3DMark03 Whitepaper|date=2003-02-11|work=Futuremark Corporation|accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a complete package, 3DMark03 consists of:

* 4 game tests:
** GT1: Wings of Fury - SM1.1 vertex shaders are used alongside fixed function pixel processing.
** GT2: Battle of Proxycon - SM1.1 vertex shaders / SM1.4 or 1.1 pixel shaders / stencil shadows
** GT3: Trolls' Lair - SM1.1 vertex shaders / SM1.4 or 1.1 pixel shaders / stencil shadows
** GT4: Mother Nature - SM1.x and SM2.0 vertex and pixel shaders
* 2 CPU tests - low resolution versions of GT1 and GT3, using software vertex shaders to provide the CPU load
* 4 Feature tests:
** Single and multi-texturing fill rate - fixed function rendering
** Vertex shader - SM1.1 vertex and pixel shaders
** Pixel shader 2.0 - procedural texturing
** Ragtroll - ragdoll physics and SM1.1 rendering
* Sound tests - a sequence of graphics tests that uses 0, 24 and 60 sound sources

|- valign="top"
| 3DMark05 || The fifth generation 3DMark.  Like 3DMark03, it is based on DirectX 9 but all of the graphics tests require a minimum hardware support of [[HLSL|Shader Model 2.0]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremark.com/pressroom/pressreleases/20402/|title=Futuremark Unveils 3DMark05|date=2004-09-29|work=Futuremark Corporation|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the tests only make use of Shader Model 2.0, by default the highest compilation profile supported by the hardware is used, including 3.0.

The final score is a [[geometric mean]] weighting the game tests equally. The CPU results are not taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremark.com/pressroom/companypdfs/3DMark05_Whitepaper_v1_1.pdf|title=3DMark05 Whitepaper v1.1|date=2005-04-26|work=Futuremark Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the free version only the part 1, "Return to Proxycon", of the demo is shown now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremark.com/support/3dmark05/|title=3DMark05 FAQ|work=Futuremark Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scoring formula was changed to incorporate CPU tests results: "For the first time in its history, the CPU result affects the final 3DMark score. This was done due to the fact that there are more and more games using complex AI algorithms and complex physics calculations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremark.com/pressroom/companypdfs/3DMark06_Whitepaper_v1_0_2.pdf|title=3DMark06 Whitepaper v1.0.2|date=2006-01-18|work=Futuremark Corporation|accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the graphics tests have the following features:
* [[high dynamic range rendering|HDR rendering]]
* [[Shadow mapping]] is used for all objects (specifically cascaded shadow mapping, with the depth textures filtered via hardware PCF)
* Water surfaces are created using pixel shaders with [[HDR refraction]], [[HDR reflection]], [[depth fog]] and [[Gerstner wave functions]]
* Atmospheric effects are generated via the use of heterogeneous fog, light scattering and cloud blending
* Material surfaces use either [[Blinn-Phong shading model]] or [[Strauss lighting model]] and [[subsurface scattering]] in some cases

The CPU tests in 3DMark06 are different from those found in previous 3DMark versions - instead of using software vertex shading to provide the CPU workload, path-finding, physics and engine routines are used instead, across multiple [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]s. 

The free version only show the part 1, "Return to Proxycon", of the demo. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremark.com/products/3dmark06/features/|title=3DMark06 Advanced and Professional Features|work=Futuremark Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike all of the previous versions there is no demo mode in 3DMark Vantage.

Initially the 3DMark Vantage range included a free trial which allowed a single run, the Basic Edition priced at US$6.95 and the Advanced Edition priced at US$19.95. On March 15, 2011 Futuremark released an update for 3DMark Vantage that discontinued the trial edition and made the Basic Edition free to download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3DMark Vantage Now More Compatible, Basic Version Free |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2382000,00.asp |work=www.pcmag.com |accessdate=22 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322000000/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C2817%2C2382000%2C00.asp |archivedate=2011-03-22 |first=Matthew |last=Murray |date=2011-03-15 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Development of a new version of 3DMark was announced on 14 November 2011 with the final product, simply named 3DMark, released on February 4, 2013.

Scores from Windows, Android and iOS can be compared making this version of 3DMark the first to enable cross-platform performance comparisons. 

Unlike previous versions, 3DMark features separate benchmark tests with each producing its own score.

Ice Storm is a DirectX 11 feature level 9 / OpenGL ES 2.0 test targeting smartphones, tablets and entry-level PCs. Ice Storm Extreme is a variant of Ice Storm that uses more demanding settings to provide a suitable test for high-end mobile devices. 

Sling Shot is a mobile-only test introduced in March 2015 for Android and iOS, which is aimed at recent mobile devices and flagship phones.

Cloud Gate is a DirectX 11 feature level 10 test for typical home PC and notebooks.

Sky Diver is a DirectX 11 test aimed at gaming laptops and mid-range PCs that cannot achieve double-digit frame rates in the more demanding Fire Strike test.

Fire Strike is a DirectX 11 test for gaming PCs. Fire Strike Extreme is a variant of Fire Strike used to test high-performance gaming PCs with multiple GPUs. Fire Strike Ultra is yet another variant of Fire Strike, which is meant to test enthusiast-grade PCs that are able to game at 4K resolution. 

Time Spy is a DirectX 12 test added in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTRODUCING 3DMARK TIME SPY DIRECTX 12 BENCHMARK TEST|url=http://www.futuremark.com/pressreleases/introducing-3dmark-time-spy-directx-12-benchmark-test|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3DMARK TIME SPY - DIRECTX 12 BENCHMARK TEST AVAILABLE NOW|url=http://www.futuremark.com/pressreleases/3dmark-time-spy-directx-12-benchmark-test-available-now|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it uses DirectX 12, which is only available in Windows 10, it only runs on Windows 10 but not older Windows OS versions.

==History==
The museum began its development under President and Executive Director Todd Trainor, an aircraft restoration specialist, long involved with Aeronca planes,

A board was formed and the organization applied for 501(C)3 non-profit certification in early 2011;  it holds that status, now, and is currently operating as a public information service.&lt;ref name="trainor_letter_2011_06" /&gt;

At present, the artifacts are at the Museum's offices in [[Brighton, Michigan]], and in hangars at the [[Brighton Airport]], some undergoing restoration and preparation for presentation.&lt;ref name="trainor_letter_2011_06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rescuing_bomber_2013_04_21_livingston_daily" /&gt;

Currently, the Museum largely serves as an archive of thousands of documents, drawings and blueprints, technical manuals and other research references related to Aeronca aircraft, and presents these online through its website, both commercially and as free-distribution information for Aeronca aircraft operators and enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="trainor_letter_2011_06" /&gt;

==Exhibits and Artifacts==
The Museum is home to "three complete [[Aeronca K]] projects (including one seaplane), one flyable [[Aeronca T|Aeronca TAC]], a [[Aeronca C-3|C-3]] basket case, and a [[Aeronca K|KCA]] basket case," some in restoration—and over 10,000 other Aeronca artifacts and papers.&lt;ref name="trainor_letter_2011_06" /&gt;

The Museum has collected many documents, drawings, blueprints, manuals and other references from Aeronca, and from its successor, Magellan Aerospace, and from Aeronca enthusiasts, particularly those affiliated with the [[National Aeronca Association]] and the [[Fearless Aeronca Aviators]], and makes the available through its website, at [http://www.aeroncamuseum.org/ aeroncamuseum.org].

The '''''American College Dictionary''''' was the first [[Random House]] dictionary and was later expanded to create the ''[[Random House Dictionary of the English Language]]''.  First published in 1947, ''The American College Dictionary'' was edited by [[Clarence Barnhart]] based on the 1927 New ''[[Century Dictionary]]''.

==History==
The [[Random House]] publishing company entered the [[reference book]] market after World War II.  They acquired the rights to the ''[[Century Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[Dictionary of American English]]'', both out of print.&lt;ref name=GUIDE&gt;Barbara Ripp Safford and Margaret Irby Nichols, eds. ''Guide to reference materials for school library media centers'' (1998), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WELCOME&gt;[[Kurt Vonnegut]], ''Welcome to the Monkey House: A Collection of Short Works'' (1998), pp. 118–23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Many scholars participated in the development of the dictionary with over 300 specialists assisting.&lt;ref name=JAMA&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Journal of the American Medical Association: September, 11 1948|journal=[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]|volume=138|issue=2|date=11 September 1948|page=166|doi=10.1001/jama.1948.02900020062048|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=301375|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For medical and psychological in the dictionary, many physicians in the New York City area where Random House was headquartered gave their assistance.&lt;ref name=JAMA/&gt; In 1947, the dictionary was published, being edited by Clarence Barnhart and was based primarily on ''The New Century Dictionary'', an abridgement of the ''Century''.&lt;ref name=GUIDE/&gt;&lt;ref name=WELCOME/&gt; It was originally sold for $5.00 and included 1432 pages.&lt;ref name=JAMA/&gt;

===Later adaptations===
In the late 1950s, it was decided to publish an expansion of the ''American College Dictionary'', which had been modestly updated with each reprinting since its publication. Under editors Jess Stein and [[Laurence Urdang]], they augmented the ''American College Dictionary'' with large numbers of entries in all fields, primarily proper names, and published it in 1966 as ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary|The Random House Dictionary of the English Language: The Unabridged Edition]]''. It was the first dictionary to use computers in its compilation and [[typesetting]].

==Commentary==
When the ''American College Dictionary'' was first published, ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' called it "more modern than any other similar book" and that the dictionary had included "considerable information not available in other dictionaries, such as rules for punctuation, proofreader's marks and notes on footnotes and bibliography".&lt;ref name=JAMA&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Journal of the American Medical Association: September, 11 1948|journal=[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]|volume=138|issue=2|date=11 September 1948|page=166|doi=10.1001/jama.1948.02900020062048|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=301375|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American writer, broadcaster, and [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/logophilia logophile] [[Charles Harrington Elster]] described the 1947 edition of the ''American College Dictionary'' as a "landmark" among dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrington Elster|first1=Charles|title=Looking for a New Dictionary?

'''''Annie Hall''''' is a 1977 American [[romantic comedy]] film directed by [[Woody Allen]] from a screenplay he co-wrote with [[Marshall Brickman]]. Produced by Allen's manager, [[Charles H. Joffe]], the film stars the director as Alvy Singer, who tries to figure out the reasons for the failure of his relationship with the film's eponymous female lead, played by [[Diane Keaton]] in a role written specifically for her.

Principal photography for the film began on May 19, 1976 on the South Fork of [[Long Island]], and filming continued periodically for the next ten months. Allen has described the result, which marked his first collaboration with cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]], as "a major turning point",&lt;ref name="Björkman75"&gt;{{harvnb|Björkman|1995|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that unlike the farces and comedies that were his work to that point, it introduced a new level of seriousness. Academics have noted the contrast in the settings of New York City and Los Angeles, the stereotype of gender differences in sexuality, the presentation of [[Jewish identity]], and the elements of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[modernism]].

''Annie Hall'' was screened at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] in March 1977, before its official release on April 20, 1977. The film received widespread critical acclaim, and along with winning the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], it received Oscars in three other categories: two for Allen ([[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and, with Brickman, [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]), and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Keaton. The film additionally won four [[BAFTA awards]] and a [[Golden Globe]], the latter being awarded to Keaton. Its North American box office receipts of $38,251,425 are fourth-best of Allen's works when not adjusted for inflation.

Widely regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all-time]], it ranks 31st on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|AFI's List of the greatest films in American cinema]], 4th on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|their list of greatest comedy films]] and 28th on Bravo's "100 Funniest Movies". Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called it "just about everyone's favorite Woody Allen movie".&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020512/REVIEWS08/205120301/1023 |date=May 12, 2002 |title=Great Movies: Annie Hall |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |work=The Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=January 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230002344/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20020512%2FREVIEWS08%2F205120301%2F1023 |archivedate=December 30, 2006 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's screenplay was also named the funniest ever written by the [[Writers Guild of America]] in its list of the "101 Funniest Screenplays".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dave |last=McNary |title=‘Annie Hall’ Named Funniest Screenplay by WGA Members|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/annie-hall-funniest-screenplay-writers-guild-1201639002/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the United States' [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in its [[National Film Registry]] that includes "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" films.&lt;ref name="National Film Registry" /&gt;

==Plot==
The comedian Alvy Singer is trying to understand why his relationship with Annie Hall ended a year ago. Growing up in New York, he vexed his mother with impossible questions about the emptiness of existence, but he was precocious about his innocent sexual curiosity.

Annie and Alvy, in a line for ''[[The Sorrow and the Pity]],'' overhear another man deriding the work of [[Federico Fellini]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]]; McLuhan himself steps in at Alvy's invitation to criticize the man's comprehension. That night, Annie shows no interest in sex with Alvy. Instead, they discuss his first wife, whose ardor gave him no pleasure. His second marriage was to a New York writer who didn't like sports and was unable to reach orgasm.

With Annie, it is different. The two of them have fun making a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. He met her playing [[Doubles (tennis)|tennis doubles]] with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk led her to offer him first a ride up town and then a glass of wine on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild exchange of trivial personal data is revealed in "mental subtitles" as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a night club ("[[It Had to Be You (song)|It Had to be You]]"). He suggests they kiss first to get it out of the way. After their lovemaking that night, Alvy is "a wreck", while she relaxes with a [[cannabis (drug)|joint]].

Soon Annie admits she loves him, while he buys her books on death and says that his feelings for her are more than just love. When she moves in with him, things become very tense. Eventually, he finds her arm in arm with one of her college professors and the two begin to argue whether this is the "flexibility" they had discussed. They eventually break up, and he searches for the truth of relationships, asking strangers on the street about the nature of love, questioning his formative years, and imagining a cartoon version of himself arguing with a cartoon Annie portrayed as the [[Queen (Snow White)|Evil Queen]] in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]''.

Alvy returns to dating, but the effort is marred by neurosis, bad sex, and finally an interruption from Annie, who insists he come over immediately. It turns out she needs him to kill a spider. A reconciliation follows, coupled with a vow to stay together come what may. However, their separate discussions with their therapists make it evident there is an unspoken divide. When Alvy accepts an offer to present an award on television, they fly out to Los Angeles, with Alvy's friend, Rob. However, on the return trip, they agree that their relationship is not working. After losing her to her record producer, Tony Lacey, he unsuccessfully tries rekindling the flame with a marriage proposal. Back in New York, he stages a play of their relationship but changes the ending:  now she accepts.

The last meeting for them is a wistful coda on New York's Upper West Side, when they have both moved on to someone new. Alvy's voice returns with a summation:  love is essential, especially if it is [[neuroticism|neurotic]]. Annie sings "[[Seems Like Old Times (song)|Seems Like Old Times]]" and the credits roll.

==Production==

===Writing===
The idea for what would become ''Annie Hall'' was developed as Allen walked around [[New York City]] with co-writer [[Marshall Brickman]]. The pair discussed the project on alternative days, sometimes becoming frustrated and rejecting the idea. Allen wrote a first draft of a screenplay within a four-day period, sending it to Brickman to make alterations. According to Brickman, this draft centered on a man in his forties, someone whose life consisted "of several strands. One was a relationship with a young woman, another was a concern with the banality of the life that we all live, and a third an obsession with proving himself and testing himself to find out what kind of character he had.&lt;ref name=rose274&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen himself turned forty in 1975, and Brickman suggests that "advancing age" and "worries about death" had influenced Allen's philosophical, personal approach to complement his "commercial side".&lt;ref name=rose274/&gt; Allen made the conscious decision to "sacrifice some of the laughs for a story about human beings".&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary"/&gt; He recognized that for the first time he had the courage to abandon the safety of complete broad comedy and had the will to produce a film of deeper meaning which would be a nourishing experience for the audience.&lt;ref name="Björkman75"/&gt; He was also influenced by Federico Fellini's 1963 comedy-drama ''[[8½]]'', created at a similar personal turning point, and similarly colored by each director's [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name="baxter241"/&gt;

Brickman and Allen sent the screenplay back and forth until they were ready to ask [[United Artists]] for $4 million.&lt;ref name="baxter241"&gt;{{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements from the early drafts did not survive. It was originally a drama centered on a murder mystery with a comic and romantic subplot.&lt;ref name="Lax283"&gt;{{harvnb|Lax|2000|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Allen, the murder occurred after a scene that remains in the film, the sequence in which Annie and Alvy miss the Ingmar Bergman film ''[[Face to Face (1976 film)|Face to Face]]''.&lt;ref name="Björkman79"/&gt; Although they decided to drop the murder plot, Allen and Brickman made a murder mystery many years later: 1993's ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'', also starring Diane Keaton.{{Sfn|Mitchell|2001|p=123}} The draft that Allen presented to the film's editor, [[Ralph Rosenblum]], concluded with the words, "ending to be shot."&lt;ref name=rose262&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen suggested ''[[Anhedonia]]'', a term for the inability to experience pleasure, as a working title,&lt;ref name="baxter245"&gt;{{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mel |last=Gussow |authorlink=Mel Gussow |title=Woody Allen Fights Anhedonia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/annie-ar.html |work=New York Times |date=April 20, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brickman suggested alternatives including ''It Had to Be Jew'', ''Rollercoaster Named Desire'' and ''Me and My Goy.''&lt;ref name=rose289&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advertising agency, hired by United Artists, embraced Allen's choice of an obscure word by suggesting the studio take out newspaper advertisements that looked like fake tabloid headlines such as "Anhedonia Strikes Cleveland!".&lt;ref name="rose289"/&gt; However, Allen experimented with several titles over five test screenings, including ''Anxiety'' and ''Annie and Alvy'', before settling on ''Annie Hall''.&lt;ref name=rose289/&gt;

===Casting===
Several references in the film to Allen's own life have invited speculation that it is autobiographical. Both Alvy and Allen were comedians. His birthday appears on the blackboard in a school scene;&lt;ref name="spignesi185"&gt;{{harvnb|Spignesi|1992|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; certain features of his childhood are found in Alvy Singer's;&lt;ref name="Björkman78"&gt;{{harvnb|Björkman|1995|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen went to [[New York University]] and so did Alvy. Diane Keaton's real surname is "Hall" and "Annie" was her nickname, and she and Allen were once romantically involved.&lt;ref name="Björkman83"&gt;{{harvnb|Björkman|1995|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Allen is quick to dispel these suggestions. "The stuff that people insist is autobiographical is almost invariably not," Allen said. "It's so exaggerated that it's virtually meaningless to the people upon whom these little nuances are based. People got it into their heads that ''Annie Hall'' was autobiographical, and I couldn't convince them it wasn't".&lt;ref&gt;1987 interview with William Geist in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', cited in ({{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=244}}) and in ({{harvnb|Spignesi|1992|p=188}})&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to various interviewers and commentators, he says, Alvy is not the character that is closest to himself; he identified more with the mother (Eve, played by [[Geraldine Page]]) in his next film, ''[[Interiors]]''.&lt;ref name="Björkman86"&gt;{{harvnb|Björkman|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Keaton has stated that the relationship between Alvy and Annie was partly based on her relationship with the director.&lt;ref name="keatonmemoir"&gt;{{cite web|last=Honan |first=Corinna |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2061520/Diane-Keatons-Woody-Allen-affair-blighted-bulimia-Doomed-flings-left-loveless.html |title=Diane Keaton's Woody Allen affair was blighted by bulimia: Doomed flings left her loveless |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=November 16, 2011 |accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Annie Hall was written specifically for Keaton, who had worked with Allen on ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973) and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).&lt;ref name="keatonmemoir"/&gt; She considered the character an "affable version" of herself—both were "semi-articulate, dreamed of being a singer and suffered from insecurity"—and was surprised to win an Oscar for her performance.&lt;ref name="keatonmemoir"/&gt; The film also marks the second film collaboration between Allen and Tony Roberts, their previous project being ''Play It Again, Sam''.&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary"/&gt;

Federico Fellini was Allen's first choice to appear in the cinema lobby scene because his films were under discussion,&lt;ref name="Björkman79"&gt;{{harvnb|Björkman|1995|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Allen chose cultural academic Marshall McLuhan after both Fellini and [[Luis Buñuel]] declined the cameo.&lt;ref name="baxter249"&gt;{{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cast members, Baxter claims, were aggrieved at Allen's treatment of them. The director "acted coldly" towards McLuhan, who had to return from Canada for reshooting, and [[Mordecai Lawner]], who played Alvy's father, claimed that Allen never spoke to him.&lt;ref name="baxter249"/&gt; However, during the production, Allen began a two-year relationship with [[Stacey Nelkin]], who appears in a single scene.&lt;ref name="baxter249"/&gt;

===Filming, editing and music===
[[File:ThunderboltConeyIsland1995.jpg|thumb|250px|Allen saw the [[Thunderbolt (Coney Island)|Coney Island Thunderbolt]] when scouting locations and wrote it into the script as Alvy's childhood home.&lt;ref name="spignesi185"/&gt;]]
Principal photography began on May 19, 1976 on the South Fork of [[Long Island]] with the scene in which Alvy and Annie boil live lobsters; filming continued periodically for the next ten months,&lt;ref name="baxter247"&gt;{{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deviated frequently from the screenplay. There was nothing written about Alvy's childhood home lying under a roller coaster, but when Allen was scouting locations in Brooklyn with Willis and art director Mel Bourne, he "saw this roller-coaster, and&amp;nbsp;... saw the house under it. And I thought, we have to use this."&lt;ref name="Björkman78"/&gt; Similarly, there is the incident where Alvy scatters a trove of cocaine with an accidental sneeze: although not in the script, the joke emerged from a rehearsal happenstance and stayed in the movie. In audience testing, this laugh was so sustained that a much longer pause had to be added so that the following dialogue was not lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=284-284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editor Ralph Rosenblum's first assembly of the film in 1976 left Brickman disappointed. "I felt that the film was running off in nine different directions," Brickman recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|pp=280–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "It was like a first draft of a novel... from which two or three films could possibly be assembled."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenblum characterized the first cut, at two hours and twenty minutes,&lt;ref name=rose275&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "the surrealistic and abstract adventures of a neurotic Jewish comedian who was reliving his highly flawed life and in the process satirizing much of our culture... a visual monologue, a more sophisticated and more philosophical version of ''[[Take the Money and Run]]''".&lt;ref name="rose275"/&gt; Brickman found it "nondramatic and ultimately uninteresting, a kind of cerebral exercise."&lt;ref name=rose281&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested a more linear narrative.&lt;ref name="rose283"&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present-tense relationship between Alvy and Annie was not the narrative focus of this first cut, but Allen and Rosenblum recognized it as the dramatic spine, and began reworking the film "in the direction of that relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|pp=281–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenblum recalled that Allen "had no hesitation about trimming away much of the first twenty minutes in order to establish Keaton more quickly."&lt;ref name="rose281"/&gt; According to Allen, "I didn't sit down with Marshall Brickman and say, 'We're going to write a picture about a relationship.' I mean the whole concept of the picture changed as we were cutting it."&lt;ref name="rose283"/&gt;

As the film was budgeted for two weeks of post-production photography,&lt;ref name="rose262"/&gt; late 1976 saw three separate shoots for the final segment, but only some of this material was used.&lt;ref name="rose287"&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narration that ends the film, featuring the joke about 'we all need the eggs', was conceived and recorded only two hours before a test screening.&lt;ref name="rose287"/&gt;

The credits call the film "A [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]] and [[Charles H. Joffe]] Production"; the two men were Allen's managers and received this same credit on his films from 1969 to 1993. However, for this film Joffe took producer credit and therefore received the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. The title sequence features a black background with white text in the [[Windsor (typeface)|Windsor Light Condensed]] typeface, a design that Allen would use on his subsequent films. [[Stig Björkman]] sees some similarity to [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s simple and consistent title design, although Allen says that his own choice is a cost-saving device.&lt;ref name="Björkman76"/&gt;

Very little background music is heard in the film, a departure for Allen influenced by Ingmar Bergman.&lt;ref name="Björkman76"&gt;{{harvnb|Björkman|1995|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diane Keaton performs twice in the jazz club: "It Had to be You" and "Seems Like Old Times" (the latter reprises in voiceover on the closing scene). The other exceptions include a boy's choir "Christmas Medley" played while the characters drive through Los Angeles, the Molto allegro from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Jupiter Symphony]] (heard as Annie and Alvy drive through the countryside), [[Tommy Dorsey]]'s performance of "Sleepy Lagoon",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harvey|2007|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the anodyne cover of the [[Savoy Brown]] song "A Hard Way to Go" playing at a party in the mansion of Paul Simon's character.

==Style and technique==
Technically, the film marked an advance for the director. He selected [[Gordon Willis]] as his [[cinematographer]]—for Allen "a very important teacher" and a "technical wizard," saying, "I really count ''Annie Hall'' as the first step toward maturity in some way in making films."&lt;ref name="Björkman77"&gt;{{harvnb|Björkman|1995|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was considered an "odd pairing" by many, Keaton among them. The director was known for his comedies and farces, while Willis was known as "the prince of darkness" for work on dramatic films like ''[[The Godfather (film)|The Godfather]]''.&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary"&gt;{{cite video |people=Weide, Robert B. (Director) |year=2011 |title=Woody Allen: A Documentary |url= |medium=Television |trans_title= |publisher=[[PBS]] |location= |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the two became friends during filming and continued the collaboration on several later films, including ''[[Zelig]]'', which earned Willis his first Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary"/&gt;

Willis described the production for the film as "relatively easy."&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary"/&gt; He shot in varying styles; "hot golden light for [[California]], grey overcast for Manhattan and a forties Hollywood glossy for&amp;nbsp;... dream sequences," most of which were cut.&lt;ref name="baxter248"&gt;{{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=2487}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his suggestion which led Allen to film the dual therapy scenes in one set divided by a wall instead of the usual [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] method.&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary"/&gt; He tried long takes, with some shots, unabridged, lasting an entire scene, which, for Ebert, add to the dramatic power of the film: "Few viewers probably notice how much of ''Annie Hall'' consists of people talking, simply talking. They walk and talk, sit and talk, go to shrinks, go to lunch, make love and talk, talk to the camera, or launch into inspired monologues like Annie's free-association as she describes her family to Alvy. This speech by Diane Keaton is as close to perfect as such a speech can likely be&amp;nbsp;... all done in one take of brilliant brinksmanship." He cites a study that calculated the [[average shot length]] of ''Annie Hall'' to be 14.5 seconds, while other films made in 1977 had an average shot length of 4–7 seconds.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; [[Peter Cowie]] suggests that "Allen breaks up his extended shots with more orthodox cutting back and forth in conversation pieces, so that the forward momentum of the film is sustained."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cowie|1996|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernd Herzogenrath notes the innovation in the use of the split screen during the dinner scene to powerfully exaggerate the contrast between the Jewish and the gentile family.&lt;ref name="Herzogenrath"/&gt;

Although the film is not essentially experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Bailey|title=The Reluctant Film Art of Woody Allen|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|date=September 29, 2010|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5rGWBIW_FgC&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film.&lt;ref name="Bernardoni01"/&gt; In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line to see a movie with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to correct the man's errors personally.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, "mental subtitles" convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; An animated scene—with artwork based on the [[comic strip]] ''[[Inside Woody Allen]]''—depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]''.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the "[[fourth wall]]" is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable "wish-fulfillment." Allen chose to have Alvy break the [[fourth wall]], he explained, "because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them."&lt;ref name="Björkman77"/&gt;

==Critical analysis==

===Love and sexuality===
[[File:Woody Allen (2006).jpeg|left|thumb|upright|Woody Allen in New York City in 2006]]
Sociologists [[Virginia Rutter]] and [[Pepper Schwartz]] consider Alvy and Annie's relationship to be a stereotype of gender differences in sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutter|Schwartz|2012|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of love is a repeating subject for Allen and co-star Tony Roberts described this film as "the story of everybody who falls in love, and then falls out of love and goes on."&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary"/&gt; Alvy searches for love's purpose through his effort to get over his depression about the demise of his relationship with Annie. Sometimes he sifts through his memories of the relationship, at another point he stops people on the sidewalk, with one woman saying that "It's never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades," a suggestion that it was no one's fault, they just grew apart and the end was inevitable. By the end of the film, Alvy accepts this and decides that love is ultimately "irrational and crazy and absurd", but a necessity of life.{{sfn|Pennington|2007|p=72}} Knight believes Alvy's quest upon meeting Annie is carnal, whereas hers is on an emotional note.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2004|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Brody of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' notes the film's "Eurocentric art-house self-awareness" and Alvy Singer's "psychoanalytic obsession in baring his sexual desires and frustrations, romantic disasters, and neurotic inhibitions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Brody| first= Richard| url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/notebook/2012/06/25/120625gonb_GOAT_notebook_brody|title=It Begins Now| work= [[The New Yorker]] |date=June 25, 2012|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish identity===
Singer is identified with the stereotypical neurotic Jewish male, and the differences between Alvy and Annie are often related to the perceptions and realities of Jewish identity. Vincent Brook notes that "Alvy dines with the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]]-y Hall family and imagines that they must see him as a [[Hasidic Jew]], complete with [[payot|payess]] (ear locks) and a large black hat."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brook |2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert M. Seltzer and Norman J. Cohen highlight the scene in which Annie remarks that Annie's grandmother "hates Jews. She thinks they just make money, but she’s the one. Is she ever, I’m telling you.", revealing the hypocrisy in her grandmother's stereotypical American view of Jews by arguing that "no stigma attaches to the love of money in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seltzer|Cohen|1995|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernd Herzogenrath also considers Allen's joke, "I would like to but we need the eggs", to the doctor at the end when he suggests putting him in a mental institution, to be a paradox of not only the persona of the urban neurotic Jew but also of the film itself.&lt;ref name="Herzogenrath"&gt;{{harvnb|Herzogenrath|2009|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woody Allen persona===
Christopher Knight points out that ''Annie Hall'' is framed through Alvy's experiences.  "Generally, what we know about Annie and about the relationship comes filtered through Alvy, an intrusive narrator capable of halting the narrative and stepping out from it in order to entreat the audience's interpretative favor."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2004|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that because Allen's films blur the protagonist with "past and future protagonists as well as with the director himself", it "makes a difference as to whether we are most responsive to the director's or the character's framing of events".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2004|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the narrative's framing, "the joke is on Alvy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2004|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Emanuel Levy]] believes that Alvy Singer became synonymous with the public perception of Woody Allen in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Levy| first= Emanuel|url=http://emanuellevy.com/review/annie-hall-1977-oscar-winner-4/|title=Annie Hall (1977): Oscar Winner| work= Emanuellevy.com|date=November 30, 2005|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Annie Hall'' is viewed as the definitive Woody Allen film in displaying neurotic humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tueth|2012|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
[[File:Upper East Side NYC.jpg|thumb| [[Upper East Side]] of New York City]]
''Annie Hall'' "is as much a love song to New York City as it is to the character,"&lt;ref name="sparknotes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/film/anniehall/themes.html |title=Annie Hall: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols |publisher=[[SparkNotes]] |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting Allen's adoration of the island of [[Manhattan]]. It was a relationship he explored repeatedly, particularly in films like ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979) and ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986).&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary"/&gt; Annie Hall's apartment, which still exists on East 70th Street between [[Lexington Avenue]] and [[Park Avenue]] is by Allen's own confession his favorite block in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|2008|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Cowie argues that the film shows "a romanticized view" of the borough, with the camera  "linger[ing] on the [[Upper East Side]] [... and where] the fear of crime does not trouble its characters."&lt;ref name="cowie21"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowie |1996|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, California is presented less positively, and David Halle notes the obvious "invidious intellectual comparison" between New York City and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halle|2003|p=443}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Manhattan's movie theaters show classic and foreign films, [[Los Angeles]] theaters run less-prestigious fare such as ''[[Lisa and the Devil|The House of Exorcism]]'' and ''[[Messiah of Evil]]''.&lt;ref name="cowie21"/&gt; Rob's demonstration of adding [[canned laughter]] to television demonstrates the "cynical artifice of the medium".&lt;ref name="cowie21"/&gt; New York serves as a symbol of Alvy's personality ("gloomy, claustrophobic, and socially cold, but also an intellectual haven full of nervous energy") while Los Angeles is a symbol of freedom for Annie.&lt;ref name="sparknotes"/&gt;

===Psychoanalysis and modernism===
''Annie Hall'' has been cited as a film which uses both therapy and analysis for comic effect.&lt;ref name="Media2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychoanalysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qp_bmDWpReoC&amp;pg=PT7|date=May 1, 2002|publisher=Lichtenstein Creative Media|isbn=978-1-888064-82-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam B. Girgus]] considers ''Annie Hall'' to be a story about memory and retrospection, which "dramatizes a return via narrative desire to the repressed and the unconscious in a manner similar to psychoanalysis".&lt;ref name="Girgus02"&gt;{{harvnb|Girgus|2002|pp=50–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the film constitutes a self-conscious assertion of how narrative desire and humor interact in the film to reform ideas and perceptions and that Allen's deployment of Freudian concepts and humor forms a "pattern of skepticism toward surface meaning that compels further interpretation". Girgus believes that proof of the pervasiveness of [[Sigmund Freud]] in the film is demonstrated at the beginning through a reference to a joke in ''[[Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious]]'', and makes another joke about a psychiatrist and patient, which Girgus argues is also symbolic of the dynamic between humor and the unconscious in the film.&lt;ref name="Girgus02"/&gt; Further Freudian concepts are later addressed in the film with Annie's recall of a dream to her psychoanalyst in which [[Frank Sinatra]] is smothering her with a pillow, which alludes to Freud's belief in dreams as "visual representations of words or ideas".&lt;ref name="Girgus02"/&gt;

Peter Bailey in his book ''The Reluctant Film Art of Woody Allen'', argues that Alvy displays a "genial denigration of art" which contains a "significant equivocation", in that in his self-deprecation he invites the audience to believe that he is leveling with them.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{harvnb|Bailey|2001|pp=37–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bailey argues that Allen's devices in the film, including the subtitles which reveal Annie's and Alvy's thoughts "extend and reinforce ''Annie Hall'' 's winsome ethos of plain-dealing and ingenuousness".&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; He muses that the film is full of antimimetic emblems such as Mcluhan's magical appearance which provide quirky humor, and that the "disparity between mental projections of reality and actuality" drives the film. His view is that self-reflective cinematic devices intelligently dramatize the difference between surface and substance, with visual emblems "incessantly distilling the distinction between the world mentally constructed and reality".&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

In his discussion of the film's relation to [[modernism]], Thomas Schatz finds the film an unresolved "examination of the process of human interaction and interpersonal communication"&lt;ref name="schatz186"&gt;{{harvnb|Schatz|1982|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "immediately establishes [a] self-referential stance" that invites the spectator "to read the narrative as something other than a sequential development toward some transcendent truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schatz|1982|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, Alvy "is the victim of a tendency toward overdetermination of meaning – or in modernist terms 'the tyranny of the signified' – and his involvement with Annie can be viewed as an attempt to establish a spontaneous, intellectually unencumbered relationship, an attempt which is doomed to failure."&lt;ref name="schatz186"/&gt; Marcus Geduld cites the flashback to Alvy as a child (in a therapist's office with his mother) as an example of basic problems (poverty, discordant parents) being masked by a supposed [[existential crisis]].&lt;ref name="Geluld"&gt;{{Cite web

==Release==

===Box office===
''Annie Hall'' was shown at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] in March 1977,&lt;ref name="baxter245"/&gt; before its  official release on April 20, 1977.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"/&gt; The film ultimately earned $38,251,425 ($143,228,400 in 2013 dollars) in the United States against a $4-million budget, making it the 11th highest-grossing picture of 1977.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"/&gt; On raw figures, it currently ranks as Allen's fourth-highest-grossing film, after ''Manhattan'', ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' and ''[[Midnight in Paris]]''; when adjusted for inflation, the gross figure makes it Allen's biggest box office hit.&lt;ref name="rankings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Director&amp;id=woodallen.htm |title=Woody Allen Movie Box Office Results |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first released on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on January 24, 2012 alongside Allen's 1979 film ''Manhattan''.&lt;ref name="blurrayrelease"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nashawaty |first=Chris |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20562561,00.html |title=Annie Hall Review |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=January 24, 2012 |accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both releases include the films' original theatrical trailers.&lt;ref name="blurrayrelease"/&gt;

===Critical response===
''Annie Hall'' was met with widespread critical acclaim upon its release. [[Tim Radford]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the film "Allen's most closely focused and daring film to date".&lt;ref name="gaurdian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Radford |first=Tim |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/annie-hall-archive-review |title=Annie Hall: Archive review |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 29, 1977 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''' [[Vincent Canby]] preferred ''Annie Hall'' to Allen's second directorial effort, ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', since the former is more "humane" while the latter is more a "cartoon".&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AE562BC4951DFB266838C669EDE |title=Movie Review – Annie Hall |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby|date=April 21, 1977 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics have compared the film favorably to Bergman's ''[[Scenes from a Marriage]]'' (1973),&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph McBride (writer)|url=https://variety.com/1977/more/reviews/annie-hall-1200424062/|title=Variety Reviews – Annie Hall|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=March 29, 1979|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slant"/&gt; including Joseph McBride in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', who found it Allen's "most three-dimensional film to date" with an ambition equal to Bergman's best even as the co-stars become the "contemporary equivalent of&amp;nbsp;... [[Spencer Tracy|Tracy]]-[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]]."&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

More critically, Peter Cowie commented that the film "suffers from its profusion of cultural references and asides".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cowie |1996|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing for [[New York Magazine]], the hard-to-please critic [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] called the film "unfunny comedy, poor moviemaking, and embarrassing self-revelation," and wrote that Keaton's performance was "in bad taste to watch and indecency to display," saying the part should have been played by Robin Mary Paris, the actress who appears briefly in the scene where Alvy Singer has written a two-character play nakedly based on himself and Annie Hall.  Simon's review of ''Annie Hall'' made a general assessment that didn't pan out: "It is a film so shapeless, sprawling, repetitious, and aimless as to seem to beg for oblivion. At this, it is successful."&lt;ref&gt;John Simon, New York Magazine, May 2, 1977, pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

After more than a quarter century, the film has continued to receive positive reviews. In his 2002 lookback, [[Roger Ebert]] noted with surprise that the film had "an instant familiarity" despite its age,&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; and ''[[Slant (magazine)|Slant]]'' writer Jaime N.

===Legacy and influence===
[[File:Keaton in Annie Hall.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Keaton's dress style as Annie Hall; an influence on the fashion world during the late 1970s]]
Although the film received critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, and said in an interview, "When ''Annie Hall'' started out, that film was not supposed to be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind&amp;nbsp;... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about&amp;nbsp;... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie".&lt;ref name="cinemablendinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Woody-Allen-Explains-Why-Annie-Hall-Hannah-Her-Sisters-Were-Disappointments-31531.html |title=Woody Allen Explains Why Annie Hall And Hannah And Her Sisters Were Disappointments |publisher=Cinema Blend |last=Eisenberg |first=Eric |date=June 22, 2012 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Biskind |authorlink=Peter Biskind |title=Reconstructing Woody |work=Vanity Fair|url = http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2005/12/woodyallen200512?currentPage=1 |date=December 2005 |accessdate=January 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 1992 interview stated that "[[Sequel]]ism has become an annoying thing.  I don't think [[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Coppola]] should have done ''[[The Godfather Part III|Godfather III]]'' because ''[[The Godfather Part II|Godfather II]]'' was quite great.  When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Björkman|1995|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diane Keaton has stated that Annie Hall was her favorite role and that the film meant everything to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|2001|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if being most associated with the role concerned her as an actress, she replied, "I'm not haunted by Annie Hall. I'm happy to be Annie Hall. If somebody wants to see me that way, it's fine by me". Costume designer [[Ruth Morley]], working with Keaton, created a look which had an influence on the fashion world during the late-70s, with women adopting the style: layering oversized, mannish blazers over vests, billowy trousers or long skirts, a man's tie, and boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steele|2010|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; The look was often referred to as the "''Annie Hall'' look".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eagan|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources suggest that Keaton herself was mainly responsible for the look, and Ralph Lauren has often claimed credit, but only one jacket and one tie were purchased from Ralph Lauren for use in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gross, Michael|date= January 18, 1993|title=Letters: The Costumer is Always Right|journal=New York Magazine|publisher=New York Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhgAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen recalled that Lauren and Keaton's dress style almost did not end up in the film. "She came in," he recalled in 1992, "and the costume lady on ''Annie Hall'' said, 'Tell her not to wear that. She can't wear that.  It's so crazy.' And I said, 'Leave her. She's a genius. Let's just leave her alone, let her wear what she wants.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Björkman|1995|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Bernardoni states that the film is "one of the very few romantic comedy-dramas of the New Hollywood era and one that has rightly taken its place among the classics of that reverted genre", likening the seriocomic meditation on the couple relationship to [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Adam's Rib]]'' (1949), starring [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Spencer Tracy]].&lt;ref name="Bernardoni01"&gt;{{harvnb|Bernardoni|2001|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its release, other romantic comedies have inspired comparison. ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997), ''[[Burning Annie]]'' (2007), ''[[500 Days of Summer]]'' (2009) and Allen's 2003 film, ''[[Anything Else]]'', are among them,&lt;ref name="sightandsound"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allmovie"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.allmovie.com/work/500-days-of-summer-451495|title=500 Days of Summer &gt; Overview|work=Allmovie|last=Buchanan|first=Jason|accessdate= January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2009-07-16-500-days-of-summer_N.htm|title=Bask in the warmth of delightful '(500) Days of Summer'|work=USA Today|last=Puig|first=Claudia|accessdate=July 19, 2009|date =July 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James|first= Caryn|title=It's Harry (Loves) Sally in a Romance Of New Yorkers and Neuroses|work=The New York Times|date=July 12, 1989|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/12/movies/review-film-it-s-harry-loves-sally-in-a-romance-of-new-yorkers-and-neuroses.html|accessdate =September 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerve.com/entertainment/ranked/ranked-woody-allen-films-from-worst-to-best?page=3|title=Ranked: Woody Allen Films from Worst to Best – Page 3 |work=Nerve.com|date=May 17, 2011|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while film director [[Rian Johnson]] said in an interview for the book, ''[[The Film That Changed My Life]]'', that ''Annie Hall'' inspired him to become a film director.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2011|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Gillan]] stated that she watched ''Annie Hall'' as part of her research for her lead role in ''[[Not Another Happy Ending]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2014/02/fifthestate-notanotherhappyending-dvds-130214120008.html People: DVD roundup (The Fifth Estate, Not Another Happy Ending)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Michael Falk ''' (16 February 1943 – 4 August  1990) was a British television [[reporter]] and interviewer perhaps best known for his contributions to the [[BBC]] current affairs and magazine programme ''[[Nationwide (TV series)|Nationwide]]'' in the 1970s and the [[BBC Radio 4]] travel programme ''[[Breakaway (radio programme)|Breakaway]]'' in the 1980s.

He was born in [[Southport]], [[Lancashire]] the son of Samuel, a wine merchant, and Belinda Mary Falk (née Kennedy), and was educated at [[Liverpool College]]. He began his career in print [[journalism]] with the ''Birkenhead News'' and played Liverpool's [[Cavern Club]] in the evenings as a member of a beat group called 'Tony Snow and his Blizzards', later renamed 'The Bohemians'. He then worked on [[Fleet Street]] for the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', before his first job as a television reporter on [[Scottish Television]]'s regional news programme ''[[Scotland Today]]'', covering local issues across Central Scotland. He quickly graduated to ''Scotland Today Report'', a weekly current affairs programme - filmed mostly within STV's region - on the issues of the day. 

He enjoyed a short spell at [[BBC Scotland]], appearing on ''[[Reporting Scotland]]'' and then, an often controversial series of late-night entertainment shows called ''Falk On....'' with the last word of the title featured the subject to be discussed. He later moved to London to join BBC current affairs, appearing in programmes including ''[[24 Hours (TV series)|24 Hours]]''. 

In 1971 Falk was imprisoned for four days in [[HM Prison Crumlin Road|Belfast's Crumlin Road jail]] for contempt of court. He had interviewed a member of the IRA but refused to reveal his source to the police.

He was also notable for hosting the early [[reality television]] survival show ''Now Get Out of That,'' the late-night live chat show/discussion programme ''[[Sin on Saturday]]'' in August 1982 - which was axed after three shows - and for reporting on British [[general election]] night programmes. He also worked on ''[[Start The Week]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]] and was the regular presenter of BBC Radio 4's Saturday morning travel programme, ''Breakaway''. 

Falk had a history of heart problems and died of a heart attack, aged 47. He was married and divorced twice.

:''Not to be confused with the [[Pacific white skate]], Bathyraja spinosissima''.
The '''bottlenose skate''', '''spearnose skate''', or '''white skate''' (''Rostroraja alba'') is a species of [[Skate (fish)|skate]] in the family [[Rajidae]]. It is a [[benthic]] [[fish]] native to the coastal eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Due to [[overfishing]], it has been depleted or [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in many parts of its former range in the northeastern Atlantic and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and is now [[endangered]].

==Distribution and habitat==
The bottlenose skate is found along the [[coastline]]s of the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]], from the southern [[British Isles]] to [[South Africa]], including the [[Mediterranean]], and extending into the southwestern [[Indian Ocean]] to [[Mozambique]]. It is listed as occurring in the northwestern [[Europe]]an seas, but no valid records exist for the northern areas of the northeast Atlantic. It is a [[benthic]] species of [[sand]]y and [[detritus|detrital]] bottoms, at depths of 40–400 m (exceptionally down to 500 m) from coastal regions to the upper [[continental slope]]. Du Buit (1974) reported that it is more prevalent in rocky habitats.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

==Description==
Most bottlenose skates are 60–150&amp;nbsp;cm long,&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; with maximum recorded lengths of 230&amp;nbsp;cm for males and 202&amp;nbsp;cm for females.&lt;ref name="fishbase"&gt;{{FishBase |genus=Rostroraja |species=alba |month=November |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flattened, angular [[pectoral fin]] fisc is about 1.4–1.5 times as broad as long. The [[snout]] is broad-based, abruptly tapering to a protruding sharp point and covered with small, sharp thorns. There are 40–45 rows of [[teeth]] in the [[upper jaw]]. The juveniles have 1 thorn before and 0–1 thorns behind the [[eye]]s and three rows of large thorns on the tail, 10–16 on the midline and 7–17 on either side. The adults have about 6 thorns around the inner margin of the [[orbit (eye)|orbit]] and 16–30 mid-dorsal and 17–29 lateral thorns on the tail. The [[skin]] is rough in adults except for a smooth patch in the center of the disc; the underside is prickly except for smooth patches on the snout. The young are entirely smooth, except for on the snout. Large juveniles and adults are greyish or bluish with or without numerous small white spots above, white below with brown to black disc margins. Hatchlings are plain reddish-brown above, often with blue spots, and white below with broad dusky disc margins.&lt;ref name="fishbase"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith et al."&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, J.L.B |author2=Smith, M. |author3=Smith, M.M. |author4=Heemstra, P. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Smith's Sea Fishes |publisher=Struik |year=2003 |isbn=1-86872-890-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lythgoe"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lythgoe, J |author2=G |last-author-amp=yes |title=Fishes of the Sea: The North Atlantic and Mediterranean |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1991 |isbn=0-262-12162-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
The bottlenose skate is a benthic [[predator]] of [[bony fish]]es, other [[elasmobranch]]s, [[fish]] [[offal]], [[crab]]s, [[shrimp]]s, [[mysid]]s, [[octopus]], and [[cuttlefish]]. Younger, smaller fish are usually found in shallower water. Like other skates, this species is [[oviparous]], with females producing 55-156 [[Ovum|ova]] per year after a [[gestation period]] of 15 months. The [[Egg case (Chondrichthyes)|egg case]]s are oblong in shape, with stiff pointed horns at each corners and the larger horns flattened. They are deposited in sandy or muddy flats in the [[spring (season)|spring]]. The capsules measure 12.5-18.3&amp;nbsp;cm long and 10.0-13.9&amp;nbsp;cm wide.&lt;ref name="fishbase"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lythgoe"/&gt; This species is estimated to mature at 130&amp;nbsp;cm for males and 120&amp;nbsp;cm for females.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

==Relationship to humans==
In the 17th century, the bottlenose skate was prized by the [[French people|French]] for food.&lt;ref name="lythgoe"/&gt; Because of its large size and slow reproductive rate, the bottlenose skate is extremely vulnerable to exploitation by [[fisheries]]. Anecdotal data suggests that there has been a substantial decline in the abundance and geographical range of this species in the north Atlantic and Mediterranean. In the north Atlantic, populations of bottlenose skates have declined severely or disappeared from the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the [[Irish Sea]]; there are no longer targeted fisheries in these regions due to localized population collapses in the 1960s. There are also no recent records of this species in the waters off the [[United Kingdom]], where it historically occurred. The bottlenose ray still persists along the coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], though the population data is uncertain due to confusion with the [[shagreen ray]] (''Leucoraja fullonica'') and the [[sandy ray]] (''L. circularis'').&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

In the Mediterranean, bottlenose skates of most size classes down to egg cases are taken as [[by-catch]] in multi-species [[trawling]] fisheries. Historically, it was caught frequently off the coasts of [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]] in the 1970s and was described as more or less frequent in the northwestern Mediterranean from the 1950s to the 1970s. The MEDITS trawl surveys, begun in 1985 and carried out six times a year in four geographic regions, indicates that the bottlenose skate is now very rare in the Mediterranean and that it has been reduced to a small fraction of its former range. The [[Italy|Italian]] National Group for Demersal Resource Evaluation (GRUND) survey captured this species infrequently in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The species is assessed globally as Endangered in the [[IUCN Red List]], and Critically Endangered in the northeast Atlantic. However, its status will require re-evaluation once data from its African range is available.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; In 2010, Greenpeace International added the bottlenose skate to its Seafood Red List, which includes commonly marketed species that "have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205030730/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=5 February 2010 }}.

The '''Chronicle of Early Kings''', Chronicle 20 in Grayson’s ''Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles''&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{ cite book | title = Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles | author = A. K Grayson |publisher = J. J. Augustin | year = 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mesopotamia]]n  Chronicle 40 in Glassner’s ''Chroniques mésopotamiennes''&lt;ref name=cm&gt;{{ cite book | title = Chroniques mésopotamiennes | author = [[Jean-Jacques Glassner]] | publisher = La Roue à Livres | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is preserved on two tablets, tablet A&lt;ref group=i&gt;BM 26472 (98-5-14, 290) tablet A.&lt;/ref&gt; is well preserved whereas tablet B&lt;ref group=i&gt;BM 96152 (1902-4-12, 264) tablet B.&lt;/ref&gt; is broken and the text fragmentary. Episodic in character, it seems to have been composed from linking together the [[Apodosis (linguistics)|apodoses]] of omen literature, excerpts of the [[Weidner Chronicle]] and year-names.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = Assyria and Babylonia | author = A. K. Grayson | journal = Orientalia | volume = 49 | jstor = 43074973 | year = 1980 | pages = 180–181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with events from the late third-millennium reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]] and ends, where the tablet is broken away, with that of [[Agum III]], c.a 1500 BC.

A third [[Babylonian Chronicles|Babylonian Chronicle]] Fragment B,&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{rp|192}} Mesopotamian Chronicle 41&lt;ref name=cm/&gt; deals with related subject matter and may be a variant tradition of the same type of work.

==The text==

Tablet A begins with a lengthy passage concerning the rise and eventual downfall of Sargon of Akkad, caused by his impious treatment of [[Babylon]]:

{{quotation|He dug up the dirt of the pit of Babylon and &lt;br&gt;made a counterpart of Babylon next to [[Akkad (city)|Agade]].&lt;br&gt; Because of the wrong he had done the great lord [[Marduk]] became angry and &lt;br&gt;wiped out his people by famine.&lt;br&gt; They (his subjects) rebelled against him &lt;br&gt;from east to west&lt;br&gt; and he (Marduk) afflicted [him] with insomnia.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{rp|153–154}}|from ''Chronicle of Early Kings'' Tablet A, lines 18–23}}

This seemingly anachronous reference to Babylon reproduces text from the Weidner Chronicle. Little is known of the city of Babylon in the third-millennium with the earliest reference to it coming from a year-name of [[Shar-Kali-Sharri|Šar-kali-šarri]], Sargon’s grandson.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Babylon: Wissenskultur in Orient und Okzident | chapter = Babylon: Origins | author = W. G. Lambert | editor = Eva Cancik-Kirschbaum, Margarethe Van Ess | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2011 | page = 71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Chronicle devotes a mere six lines to his nephew, Naram-Sin, and two campaigns against Apišal, a city located in northern Syria,&lt;ref name=bryce&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Routledge Handbook of The Peoples and Places of Ancient Western Asia | author = Trevor Bryce | publisher = Routledge | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51–52}} and [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]], thought to be in ancient [[Oman]].&lt;ref name=bryce/&gt;{{rp|436–437}} That of Apišal appears as an apodosis to an omen in the [[Bārûtu]], the compendium of sacrificial omens.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Proceedings of the 53e Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Vol. 1: Language in the Ancient Near East, part 1 | chapter = The Sign of the Flood and the Language of Signs in Babylonian Omen Literature | author = A. R. George | publisher = Eisenbrauns | year = 2010 | page = 328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shulgi|Šulgi]] receives short shrift from Marduk, who wreaks a terrible revenge for his expropriation of the property of Marduk’s temple, the [[Esagila|Ésagil]], and Babylon, as he “caused (something or other) to consume his body and killed him” in a passage that, despite its perfect state of preservation, remains unintelligible.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{rp|154}} [[Erra-imitti|Erra-Imittī]]’s legendary tale of his demise and that of [[Enlil-bani|Enlil-bāni]]’s ascendency occupies the next passage, followed by a terse observation that “[[Ilu-shuma|Ilu-šūma]] was king of Assyria in time of Su-abu”, who was once identified with [[Sumu-abum]], the founder of the [[First Dynasty of Babylon]] until a consideration of the relative chronologies made this identification unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Zweite Zwischenzeit Babyloniens | author = D. O. Edzard | publisher = Otto Harrassowitz | year = 1957 | pages = 140–141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablet concludes with the label or mark &lt;small&gt;GIGAM.DIDLI&lt;/small&gt; which may have been a scribal catalog reference or alternatively denote continuing disruption, as &lt;small&gt;GIGAM&lt;/small&gt; represents ''ippiru'', “strife, conflict.”&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Soundings in Kings: Perspectives and Methods in Contemporary Scholarship | chapter = Warfare and Treaty Formulas in the Background of Kings | author = Klaus-Peter Adam | editor = edited by Klaus-Peter Adam, Mark Leuchter | publisher = Fortress Press | year = 2010 | page = 174 }} note 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Tablet B opens with a duplication of the six lines telling of the demise of Erra-Imittī, followed by a section relating [[Hammurabi|Ḫammu-rāpi]]’s expedition against [[Rim-Sin I]], whom he brought to Babylon in a ki-is-kap (a ''ḫúppu''), a large basket.&lt;ref&gt;CAD Ḫ, Ḫuppu A, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samsu-iluna]]’s handling of the revolt of [[Rim-Sin II]] occupies the next section, but here the text is poorly preserved and the events uncertain until it records the victory of [[Ilum-ma-ili|Ilum-ma-ilī]], the founder of the [[Sealand Dynasty]], over Samsu-iluna’s army. [[Abi-Eshuh|Abī-Ešuḫ]]’s damming of the [[Tigris]] follows, which fails to contain the wiley Ilum-ma-ilī. The history of the First Babylonian dynasty concludes with the [[Hittites|Hittite]] invasion during the reign of [[Samsu-Ditana|Samsu-ditāna]].

The final two passages switch to events in the early [[Kassites|Kassite]] Dynastic period, first with the last king of the Sealand Dynasty, [[Ea-gamil]], fleeing ahead of the invasion of [[Ulamburiash|Ulam-Buriaš]] and then the second invasion led by [[Agum III]].&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{rp|156}}

{{Grammatical categories}}
'''Comparison''' is a feature in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] or [[syntax (linguistics)|syntax]] of some [[language]]s, whereby [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s are [[inflection|inflected]] or modified to indicate the relative degree of the property defined by the adjective or adverb. The [[comparative]] expresses a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality, quantity, or degree; the '''superlative''' is the form of an adverb or adjective that is the greatest degree of a given descriptor.

The [[grammatical category]] associated with comparison of adjectives and adverbs is '''degree of comparison'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Huddleston|first1=Rodney|last2=Pullum|first2=Geoffrey|year=2002|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language|pages=1099–1170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual degrees of comparison are the ''positive'', which simply denotes a property (as with the [[English grammar|English]] words ''big'' and ''fully'');  the ''comparative'', which indicates ''great'''er''''' degree (as ''bigger'' and ''more fully''); and the ''superlative'', which indicates ''great'''est''''' degree (as ''biggest'' and ''most fully'').&lt;ref&gt;Tom McArthur, ed. (1992) ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-214183-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality (called [[Elative (gradation)|elative]] in Semitic linguistics). Other languages (e.g. English) can express lesser degree, e.g. ''beautiful'', ''less beautiful'', ''least beautiful''.

The comparative is frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these words take the ''-er'' suffix or modifying word ''more'' or ''less'' (e.g., ''fast&lt;u&gt;er&lt;/u&gt;'', ''&lt;u&gt;more&lt;/u&gt; intelligent'', ''&lt;u&gt;less&lt;/u&gt; wasteful''); it can also, however, appear  when no adjective or adverb is present, for instance with nouns (e.g., ''more men than women''). One [[preposition]], ''near'', also has a superlative form, as in ''Find the restaurant nearest your house''.

==Formation of comparatives and superlatives==
Comparatives and superlatives may be formed [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]], by inflection, as with the English and [[German grammar|German]] ''-er'' and ''-(e)st'' forms, or [[syntax|syntactically]], as with the English ''more...'' and ''most...'' and the [[French grammar|French]] ''plus...'' and ''le plus...'' forms. Common adjectives and adverbs often produce irregular forms, such as ''better'' and ''best'' (from ''good'') and ''less'' and ''least'' (from ''little/few'') in English, and ''meilleur'' (from ''bon'') and ''mieux'' (from the adverb ''bien'') in French.

==Comparative and superlative constructions==
Most if not all languages have some means of forming the comparative, although these means can vary significantly from one language to the next.

Comparatives are often used with a [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] or other grammatical means to indicate with what the comparison is being made, as with ''than'' in English, ''als'' in German, etc. In [[Russian grammar|Russian]] and Greek ([[Ancient Greek grammar|Ancient]], [[Koine Greek grammar|Koine]] and [[Modern Greek grammar|Modern]]) this can be done by placing the compared noun in the [[genitive]] case. With superlatives, the class of things being considered for comparison may be indicated, as in "the best swimmer out of all the girls".

Languages also possess other structures for comparing adjectives and adverbs; English examples include "as... as" and "less/least...".

А few languages apply comparison to nouns and even verbs. One such language is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], where expressions like "по&amp;#x300; човек (po chovek), най човек (nay chovek), по-малко човек (po malko chovek)" (literally ''more person'', ''most person'', ''less person'' but normally ''better kind of a person'', ''best kind of person'', ''not that good kind of a person'') and "по&amp;#x300; обичам (po obicham), най-малко обичам (nay malko obicham)" (''I like more'', ''I like the least'') are quite usual.&lt;ref&gt;Comparatives in Bulgarian are formed with the particles по and най, separated with the following adjective or adverb with a hyphen. If they are applied to a noun or a verb, they are written as separate words with a grave accent over по ''po''. Comparatives in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] are formed identically but written as one word, Macedonian) (both meaning ''better'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage when considering only two things==

In many languages, including English, traditional grammar requires the comparative form to be used when exactly two things are being considered, even in constructions where the superlative would be used when considering a larger number. For instance, "May the better man win" would be considered correct if there are only two individuals competing. However, this rule is not always observed in informal usage; the form "May the best man win" will often be used in that situation, as it would if there were three or more competitors involved.&lt;ref name=GrammarGirl /&gt;

==Rhetorical use of unbalanced comparatives==

In some contexts, such as advertising or political speeches, absolute and relative comparatives are intentionally employed in a way that invites a comparison, and yet the basis of comparison is not established. This is a common [[rhetorical]] device used to create an implication of significance where one may not actually be present. Although such usage is common, it is sometimes [[Linguistic prescription|considered ungrammatical]].&lt;ref name=GrammarGirl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/comparatives-versus-superlatives.aspx |title=Comparatives Versus Superlatives |first=Bonnie |last=Trenga |date=12 August 2008 |work=Grammar Girl |publisher=Quick and Dirty Tips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
* Always!
* Why pay more?
* We work harder.
* We sell for less!
* More doctors recommend it.

==English==
English has two parallel systems of comparison, a morphological one formed using the suffixes ''-er'' (the "comparative") and ''-est'' (the "superlative"), with some irregular forms; and a syntactic one, formed with the adverbs "more" and "most".

As a general rule, words with one [[syllable]] require the suffix (except for the four words: fun, real, right, wrong), words with three or more syllables require "more" or "most", and words with two syllables may use one system or the other; which words use which system is a matter of idiom. Some adjectives, ''e.g.'' 'polite', can use either form, with different frequencies according to context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/archive/papers/kytorom.html |title=Competing forms of adjective comparison in modern English: What could be more quicker and easier and more effective? |first1=Merja |last1=Kytö |first2=Suzanne |last2=Romaine |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological comparison===

Morphological comparison uses the [[suffix]]es ''-er'' (the "comparative") and ''-est'' (the "superlative"). These inflections are of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin and are [[cognate]] with the [[Latin]] suffixes -''ior'' and -''issimus'' and Ancient Greek -''īōn'' and -''istos''. They are typically added to shorter words, words of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] origin, and borrowed words which have been fully assimilated into the English vocabulary. Usually the words which take these [[inflection]]s have fewer than three syllables.

This system also contains a number of irregular forms, some of which, like "good", "better", and "best", contain [[suppletion|suppletive]] forms. These irregular forms include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Positive !! Comparative !! Superlative
|-
| good || rowspan="2" | better || rowspan="2" | best
|-
| well
|-
| bad, evil || rowspan="2" | worse || rowspan="2" | worst
|-
| ill
|-
| rowspan="2" | far || farther || farthest
|-
| further || furthest
|-
| little || less(er) || least
|-
| many, much || more || most
|}

===Syntactic comparison===
The second system of comparison in English appends the [[grammatical particle]]s "more" and "most", themselves the irregular comparatives of "many" and  "much", to the adjective or adverb being modified. This series can be compared to a system containing the [[diminutive]]s "less" and "least".

This system is most commonly used with words of French or Latin derivation; with adjectives and adverbs formed with suffixes other than ''-ly'' (e.g., "beautiful"); and with longer, technical, or infrequently used words. For example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Positive !! Comparative !! Superlative
|-
| beautiful || more beautiful || most beautiful
|}

===Absolute adjectives===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}

Some adjectives, the [[ungradable adjective|absolute or ungradable adjectives]] do not appear to logically allow degrees. Some qualities are either ''present'' or ''absent'', such as being Cretaceous or igneous, so it appears illogical to call anything "very Cretaceous", or to characterize something as "more igneous" than something else.

Some grammarians object to the use of the superlative or comparative with words such as ''full'', ''complete'', ''unique'', or ''empty'', which by definition already denote either a totality, an absence, or an absolute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such words are routinely and frequently qualified in contemporary speech and writing. This type of usage conveys more of a [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] than a literal meaning, because in a strictly literal sense, something cannot be more or less unique or empty to a greater or lesser degree.

Many [[prescriptive grammar]]s and [[English usage|style guides]] include adjectives for inherently superlative qualities to be ungradable. Thus, they reject expressions such as ''more perfect'', ''most unique'', and ''most parallel'' as illogical [[pleonasm]]s: after all, if something is unique, it is one of a kind, so nothing can be "very unique", or "more unique" than something else.

Other style guides argue that terms like ''perfect'' and ''parallel'' never apply ''exactly'' to things in real life, so they are commonly used to mean ''nearly perfect'', ''nearly parallel'', and so on; in this sense, ''more perfect'' (''i.e.'', more nearly perfect, closer to perfect) and ''more parallel'' (''i.e.'', more nearly parallel, closer to parallel) are meaningful.

==Balto-Slavic languages==
In most [[Balto-Slavic languages]] (such as Czech, Polish, Lithuanian and Latvian), the comparative and superlative forms are also declinable adjectives.

In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], comparative and superlative forms are formed with the clitics ''по-'' (''more'') and ''най-'' (''most''):
:''голям'' (''big'')
:''по-голям'' (''bigger'')
:''най-голям'' (''biggest'')

In [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Slovenian language|Slovene]], comparative is formed from the base form of an adjective with a suffix and superlative is formed with a circumfix (equivalent to adding a prefix to the comparative).
:''mladý'' / ''młody'' / ''mladý'' / '' mlad'' (''young'')
:''mladší'' / ''młodszy'' / ''mladší'' / '' mlajši'' (''younger'')
:''nejmladší'' / ''najmłodszy'' / ''najmladší'' / '' najmlajši '' (''youngest'')

In [[Russian language|Russian]], comparative and superlative forms are usually formed with a suffix:
:''добрый'' (''kind'')
:''добрее'' (''kinder'')
:''добрейший'' (''kindest'')

==Romance languages==
In contrast to English, the relative and the superlative are joined into the same degree (the superlative), which can be of two kinds: comparative (e.g. "the most beautiful") and absolute (e.g. "very beautiful").

[[French language|French]]: The superlative is created from the comparative by inserting the definitive article (la, le, or les), or the possessive article (''mon'', ''ton'', ''son'', etc.), before "plus" or "moins" and the adjective determining the noun. For instance: ''Elle est la plus belle femme'' → (she is the most beautiful woman); ''Cette ville est la moins chère de France'' → (this town is the least expensive in France); ''C'est sa plus belle robe'' → (It is her most beautiful dress). It can also be created with the suffix "-issime" but only with certain words, for example: "C'est un homme richissime" → (That is the most rich man). Its use is often rare and ironic.

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] distinguish comparative superlative ''(superlativo relativo)'' and absolute superlative ''(superlativo absoluto/assoluto).
For the comparative superlative they use the words "mais" and "più" between the article and the adjective, like "most" in English.
For the absolute superlative they either use "muito"/"molto" and the adjective or modify the adjective by taking away the final vowel and adding ''issimo'' (singular masculine), ''issima'' (singular feminine), ''íssimos''/''issimi'' (plural masculine), or ''íssimas''/''issime'' (plural feminine). For example:
*''Aquele avião é velocíssimo''/''Quell'aeroplano è velocissimo'' → That airplane is very fast
There are some irregular forms for some words ending in "-re" and "-le" (deriving from Latin words ending in "-er" and "-ilis") that have a superlative form similar to the Latin one. In the first case words lose the ending "-re" and they gain the endings ''errimo'' (singular masculine), ''errima'' (singular feminine), ''érrimos''/''errimi'' (plural masculine), or ''érrimas''/''errime'' (plural feminine); in the second case words lose the "-l"/"-le" ending and gain ''ílimo''/''illimo'' (singular masculine), ''ílima''/''illima'' (singular feminine), ''ílimos''/''illimi'' (plural masculine), or ''íli
[[Romanian language|Romanian]], similar to Portuguese and Italian, distinguishes comparative and absolute superlatives. The comparative uses the word "mai" before the adjective, which operates like "more" or "-er" in English. For example: ''luminos'' → bright, ''mai luminos'' → brighter. To weaken the adjective, the word "puțin" (little) is added between "mai" and the adjective, for example ''mai puțin luminos'' → less bright. For absolute superlatives, the gender-dependent determinant "cel" precedes "mai," conjugated as "cel / cei" for male singular / plural and "cea / cele" for female singular / plural. For example: ''cea mai luminoasă stea'' → the brightest star; ''cele mai frumoase fete'' → the most beautiful girls; ''cel mai mic morcov'' → the smallest carrot.

==Celtic languages==
[[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]: When comparing one entity to another in the present or the future tense, the adjective is changed by adding an ''e'' to the end and ''i'' before the final consonant(s) if the final vowel is broad. Then, the adjective is preceded by "nas" to say "more," and ''as'' to say "most." (The word ''na'' is used to mean ''than''.) Adjectives that begin with ''f'' are lenited.  and ''as'' use different syntax constructions. For example:
Tha mi nas àirde na mo pheathraichean.'' → I am taller than my sisters.
Is mi as àirde.'' → I am the tallest.

As in English, some forms are irregular, i.e. nas fheàrr (better), nas miosa (worse), etc.

In other tenses, ''nas'' is replaced by ''na bu'' and ''as'' by ''a bu,'' both of which [[Lenition|lenite]] the adjective if possible. If the adjective begins with a vowel or an ''f'' followed by a vowel, the word ''bu'' is reduced to ''b'''. For example:

*''Bha mi na b' àirde na mo pheathraichean.'' → I was taller than my sisters.
*''B' e mi a b' àirde.'' → I was the tallest.

[[Welsh Language|Welsh]] is similar to English in many respects.  The ending ''-af'' is added onto regular adjectives in a similar manner to the English ''-est'', and with (most) long words ''mwyaf'' precedes it, as in the English ''most''.  Also, many of the most common adjectives are irregular.  Unlike English, however, when comparing just two things, the superlative ''must'' be used, e.g. of two people - ''John ydy'r talaf'' (John is the tallest).

==Akkadian==
[[Image:AmarnaLetterOfMarriageNegotiation-BritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg|right|240px|thumb|[[Amarna letter EA 19]], Para 2, (last line): "...the Gods and (our Kingly relations), forever"..."''may it be'', (one verb, (5 signs, e-le-[[ni (cuneiform)|né]]-ep-pi)), ''I-n-t-e-r-R-e-l-a-t-e-d''-!." &lt;br&gt;(The first sign "e" is rubbed off; only a space-(depression) locates it.)-(high resolution expandible photo)]]
In [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform]], (on a 12 paragraph [[clay tablet]]), from the [[time period]] of the 1350 BC [[Amarna letters]] (a roughly 20-year [[text corpus|body]] of letters), two striking examples of the superlative extend the common grammatical use. The first is the numeral "10," as well as "7 and 7." The second is a verb-spacement adjustment.

The term [[Amarna letters-phrases and quotations#7 times and 7 times again|"7 and 7"]] means 'over and over'. The phrase itself is a superlative, but an addition to some of the Amarna letters adds "more" at the end of the phrase (EA 283, ''Oh to see the King-(pharaoh)):'' ''"... I fall at the feet of the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of the king, my lord, 7 and 7 times'' '''''more,''''' ''...."''.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;{{citation
|last = Moran
|first = William L.
|authorlink=William L. Moran
|origyear = 1987|year = 1992
|title = The Amarna Letters
|url = https://www.amazon.com/Amarna-Letters-William-L-Moran/dp/0801867150#reader_0801867150

|isbn = 0-80186-715-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|323–324}} The word 'more' is Akkadian ''mila'', and by Moran is 'more' or 'overflowing'. The meaning in its letter context is "...over and over again, overflowing," (as 'gushingly', or 'obsequiously', as an underling of the king).

The numeral 10 is used for ''ten times greater'' in EA 19, ''Love and Gold'', one of King [[Tushratta]]'s eleven letters to the Pharaoh-([[Amenhotep IV]]-''[[Akhenaton]]''). The following quote using 10, also closes out the small paragraph by the second example of the superlative, where the verb that ends the last sentence is spread across the letter in s-p-a-c-i-n-g, to accentuate the last sentence, and the verb itself (i.e. the relational kingly topic of the paragraph):

:''".... Now, in keeping with our constant and mutual love, you have made it'' '''10''' ''times greater than the love shown my father. May the gods grant it, and may [[Teshub|Teššup]], my lord, and [[Amun|Aman]] make'' flourish ''for evermore, just as it is now, this mutual love of ours.''&lt;ref name="Moran" /&gt;{{rp|42–46}}

The actual last paragraph line contains three words: 'may it be', 'flourish', and 'us'. The verb flourish (from napāhu?, ''to light up, to rise''), uses: -e-le-[[ni (cuneiform)|né]]-ep-pi-, and the spaces. The other two words on the line, are made from two characters, and then one: ''"...may it be, flourish-our (relations)."''

==Estonian==
In Estonian, the superlative form can usually be formed in two ways. One is a periphrastic construction with ''kõige'' followed by the comparative form. This form exists for all adjectives. For example: the comparative form of ''sinine'' 'blue' is ''sinisem'' and therefore the periphrastic superlative form is ''kõige sinisem''. There is also a synthetic ("short") superlative form, which is formed by adding ''-m'' to the end of the plural partitive case. For ''sinine'' the plural partitive form is ''siniseid'' and so ''siniseim'' is the short superlative. The short superlative does not exist for all adjectives and, in contrast to the ''kõige''-form, has a lot of exceptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7448">The '''EDP''' ('''Electronic Document Professional''') is a professional designation awarded by [[Xplor International]] for participants in the [[electronic document]] industry who have satisfied a number of criteria.

The EDP is not a measure of specific knowledge, but awardees normally have a broad knowledge of the electronic document industry along with specific knowledge in one or more areas. Thus, the EDP differs from certifications such as the [[CDIA+]] from CompTIA in which the awardee has passed a formal exam. Rather, the EDP is more closely related to the older MIT and LIT designations from [[AIIM]]. Generally, the EDP does show that the awardee has been in the industry for at least 5 years, and has participated in at least 3 major projects showing competence in a number of 'bodies of knowledge'.

The EDP program is regulated by the EDP Commission of [[Xplor International]], which is a body of senior professionals in the electronic document industry who set the standards and judge the qualifications of the applicants.

== History ==

The first EDP 'class' (as the annual group of awardees is called) was in 1990, when 12 industry professionals were given the award. In 1991, the class was much smaller (only 6), but in 1992 and in all the years following, the number of awardees has generally been double digits, with as many as 25 at one time. The Dutch Chapter of Xplor International has particularly stressed the EDP designation as an essential part of being a professional in the electronic document industry, with the result that in some years, more than ten Dutch members alone were named EDPs, and there are more EDPs per capita in The Netherlands today than in any other country.

In 2009, Xplor relaunched its certification program, so that there is now a three-level certification process to help employers benchmark their staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.printingnews.com/web/online/Industry-News/Xplor-Expands-EDP-Certification/1$10502&lt;/ref&gt;

The EDP and the Master-EDP awards are presented once a year at the annual international conference of Xplor. While the first EDPs were awarded at the 1990 conference in Nashville, Tennessee (USA), the first 'class' of Master-EDPs was awarded at the association's annual event in St. Petersburg, Florida (USA) in March, 2010. At that event, the following industry professionals received the association's highest certification:&lt;ref name="m-edp"&gt;[http://www.xplor.org/EDP/MEDPlist.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* William Broddy, M-EDP
* Ernie Crawford, M-EDP
* Scott Draeger, M-EDP
* Oscar Dubbeldam, M-EDP
* William J. "Bill" McCalpin, M-EDP, CDIA, MIT, LIT
* Walter Riddock, M-EDP, CMDSM
* Donald Scrima, M-EDP

At the association's next annual event in April, 2011, two more industry professionals will be named M-EDPs:&lt;ref name="m-edp"/&gt;
* Pat McGrew, M-EDP
* Carrie Murphy, M-EDP

On the other hand, the new EDA designation is awarded at the point that the individual's application is accepted and verified, throughout the year. Currently (December 2010), there are 48 industry professionals who have received this designation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xplor.org/EDP/EDA.cfm?viewpage=EDAlist&lt;/ref&gt; nearly all of whom received the designation as a result of attending courses certified by Xplor and taught by [http://www.acadami.org ''acadami''], two of whose principals are M-EDPs.

== Levels of certification ==

=== Electronic Document Associate (EDA) ===
The EDA designation recognizes electronic document sales, development and support specialists who have shown significantly more knowledge of the industry than someone in another discipline.
It requires candidates to be in the industry for 2+ years and have successfully completed 5 days of Xplor Continuing Education Unit (CEU) certified courses, or the equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xplor.org/EDP/EDA.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronic Document Professional (EDP) ===
EDPs have clearly shown enough working knowledge of the process to make significant decisions regarding technology or process deployment. For example, management should trust them to lead projects, or support teams.
To become certified as an EDP, a candidate must be in the industry for 5+ years, have successfully completed 10 days of Xplor CEU training (or the equivalent), and have shown their working knowledge and experience through 3 work examples.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xplor.org/EDP/EDP.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Master Electronic Document Professional (M-EDP) ===
M-EDPs are the recognized experts on specific technologies, processes, or management skills. For example, an M-EDP may have co-developed a composition or print stream transform system. Another might be the expert on print costing, or statement design. By earning their M-EDP, they are clearly recognized as one of the ‘go to’ people in the industry.

To earn the M-EDP, a candidate must have been in the industry for at least 10 years, have been an EDP for at least 5 years, and be able to prove their area of expertise through published material.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xplor.org/EDP/MEDP.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Designees ==
In all, there are more than 500 industry professionals with the EDP designation, including:

'''''Fayuan Zhulin''''' ({{zh|c=法苑珠林|p=Fǎyuàn Zhūlín}}; "Forest of Gems in the Garden of the [[Dharma]]"), in 100 ''juan'' (卷 "volume", "fascicle"), is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[encyclopedia]] compiled AD 668 by [[Dao Shi]] (道世). It comprises Buddhist and other ancient texts otherwise lost, and is thus an important source of ancient knowledge in many fields.
It was used under the [[Ming Dynasty]] to reconstruct older [[zhiguai]] collections.

'''HMAS ''Advance'' (P 83)''' was an {{sclass-|Attack|patrol boat}} of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). Constructed during 1967 and commissioned into the RAN in 1968, ''Advance'' operated from Darwin and patrolled northern Australian waters.

During her career, the patrol boat shadowed a Soviet trawler, survived [[Cyclone Tracy]], was used for filming of the television series ''[[Patrol Boat (TV series)|Patrol Boat]]'', and participated in the RAN's first anti-terrorism patrol of the [[North West Shelf]]. ''Advance'' was replaced in 1980, but continued to operate as a training ship until she was decommissioned in 1988.

''Advance'' was donated to the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]], which has maintained her in an operational condition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anmm.gov.au/whats-on/vessels/patrol-boat-hmas-advance&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and construction==
{{main|Attack class patrol boat}}
The ''Attack'' class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as [[patrol boat]]s based on lessons learned through using the [[Ton class minesweeper]]s on patrols of Borneo during the [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]], and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft.&lt;ref name=Gillett86/&gt; Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for [[Papua New Guinea]]'s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels.&lt;ref name=Gillett86/&gt; The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were {{convert|107.6|ft}} in [[length overall]], had a beam of {{convert|20|ft|m}}, and draughts of {{convert|6.4|ft}} at standard load, and {{convert|7.3|ft|m}} at full load.&lt;ref name=Gillett86&gt;Gillett, ''Australian and New Zealand Ships since 1946'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Janes68&gt;Blackman (ed.), ''Jane's Fighting Ships, 1968–69'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied {{convert|3460|shp}} to the two propellers.&lt;ref name=Gillett86/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janes68/&gt; The vessels could achieve a top speed of {{convert|24|kn}}, and had a range of {{convert|1200|nmi}} at {{convert|13|kn}}.&lt;ref name=Gillett86/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janes68/&gt; The ship's company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors.&lt;ref name=Janes68/&gt; Main armament was a bow-mounted [[Bofors 40 mm]] gun, supplemented by two .50 calibre [[M2 Browning]] machine guns and various small arms.&lt;ref name=Gillett86/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janes68/&gt; The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the ''Attack''s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town's hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.&lt;ref name=ANMM&gt;''The patrol boat'', Australian National Maritime Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

''Advance'' was laid down by [[Walkers Limited]] at [[Maryborough, Queensland]] in March 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/detail.asp?ship_id=HMAS-Advance-P83|title=HMAS Advance (P83) Coastal Patrol Boat - Australia|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched on 16 August 1967, and commissioned on 24 January 1968.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;Mitchell, ''Past meets future''&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third ship of its class.&lt;ref name=ANMM-PB/&gt;

==Operational history==
''Advance'' operated out of {{HMAS|Coonawarra}} in [[Darwin, Northern Territory]] between 1968 and 1980.&lt;ref name="ANMM"/&gt; As well as the standard duties for her class, ''Advance'' was also used for surveillance, search-and-rescue, and hydrographic survey (in company with the survey ship {{HMAS|Moresby|1963|6}}).&lt;ref name=ANMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

During 1968, ''Advance'' and sister ship {{HMAS|Attack|P 90|2}} shadowed the Soviet trawler ''Van Gogh'', which operated in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] for two months.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frame, ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

''Advance'' and three other patrol boats were in Darwin Harbour on 25 December 1974, when [[Cyclone Tracy]] hit.&lt;ref name=Jones234&gt;Jones, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; ''Advance'' and {{HMAS|Assail|P 89|2}} managed to escape serious damage, but ''Attack'' was forced aground and suffered hull damage, and {{HMAS|Arrow|P 88|2}} collided with Stoke's Hill Wharf and sank.&lt;ref name=Jones234/&gt;

During 1975 and 1976, ''Advance'' regularly operated as part of [[Operation Trochus]]: a concentrated effort to respond to illegal fishing vessels in northern Australian waters.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

[[File:HMAS-Advance-P83-3.jpg|thumb|right|Stern view of ''Advance'']]

From late 1977, the patrol boat was assigned to {{HMAS|Waterhen|naval base|6}} in Sydney for patrols along Australia's eastern coast,&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; but was redeployed elsewhere when necessary.

In 1979, ''Advance'' was one of two ''Attack'' class vessels used to portray the fictional HMAS ''Ambush''; setting of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] television series ''[[Patrol Boat (TV series)|Patrol Boat]]''.&lt;ref name=ANMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

Following her replacement by a {{sclass-|Fremantle|patrol boat}} in 1980, ''Advance'' was reassigned as a training ship.&lt;ref name=ANMM/&gt; She was assigned to the Sydney Port Division of the [[Royal Australian Navy Reserve]] in February 1982.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

The patrol boat participated in the 1986 Naval Review.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

==Decommissioning and preservation==
''Advance'' was decommissioned on 6 February 1988, and was transferred to the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] (ANMM).&lt;ref name=ANMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;&lt;ref name=ANMM-PB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anmm.gov.au/whats-on/vessels/patrol-boat |title=Australian National Maritime Museum – Vessels – HMAS Advance |date= |publisher=Australian National Maritime Museum |accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patrol boat has been maintained in operational condition by the ANMM.&lt;ref name=ANMM/&gt;

In October 2013 ''Advance'' participated in the [[International Fleet Review 2013]] in Sydney, celebrating the centenary of the Royal Australian Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/ifr/participants/civilian-ships |title=Participating Civilian Ships |date=2013 |work=International Fleet Review 2013 website |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127111545/http://www.navy.gov.au/ifr/participants/civilian-ships |archivedate=27 November 2013 |accessdate=14 December 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner was born in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] and attended school in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood of Chicago. In 1901 she graduated with a degree in classics from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Kader |first=Themina |year=2000

|volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=164–177
|jstor=1320661|doi=10.2307/1320661}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After an interval as a teacher, she returned to the same university to study art history, and received a master's degree in 1918. In 1920 she began lecturing at the School of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], where she would spend the rest of her career, with the exception of short appointments at [[UCLA]] and the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name="Sorensen"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://arthistorians.info/gardnerh|title=Dictionary of Art Historians|last=Sorensen|first=Lee|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Helen Gardner|accessdate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, she became the head of the photograph and lantern-slides department at the Ryerson Library of the Art Institute of Chicago. The next year she started to teach an art history course at the School of the Art Institute. In 1922, she made the choice to resign her position at the library to spare more time for teaching. From the frustration of not being able to find a comprehensive textbook that had a broad enough coverage in art history, she resolved the problem by writing such book herself, which resulted in a popular art history textbook used for decades, ''Art Through the Ages''.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Helen Gardner|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Helen-Gardner|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=March 14, 2017|date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her major work, ''Art Through the Ages'' (1926), was the first single-volume textbook to cover the entire range of art history from a global perspective. Frequently revised, it remains a standard textbook at American schools and universities.&lt;ref name=ArtInstitute&gt;{{cite web|title=Case 3: Helen Gardner|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/Ryerson/Making-History/3|website=The Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=March 14, 2017|location=Chicago|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 she also published ''Understanding the Arts'', an art appreciation text directed toward educators. For both volumes, the analytical drawings were supplied by artist [[Kathleen Blackshear]].&lt;ref&gt;Landauer, Susan, and Becky Reese. "Lone Star Spirits." In Patricia Trenton, ed. ''Independent Spirits: Women Painters of the American West, 1890–1945, 199–200''. Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1995, pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, she published a second edition of ''Art Through the Ages'', with its content expanded.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

In 1946, aged 68, she died due to cancer. However, despite her illness before her death, she remained in advisory capacity at the Art Institute.&lt;ref name=ArtInstitute/&gt;

'''Human Writes''' is a long established, [[non-profit organization]] founded for the purpose of befriending prisoners on [[Death Row]] in the USA.  Whilst they are against the death penalty, the organisation does not campaign as such, its main remit being the befriending, and in many ways 'humanising' of inmates through letter writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Receiving letters can make a huge difference to [prisoners'] quality of life; prisoners speak of us as their sunshine or their window on the world.  Above all, they value being able to have a normal conversation with someone and the feeling that someone cares. [http://www.humanwrites.org Human Writes website]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'Human Writes' is not linked to any particular political or religious groups.  The organisation has become well known internationally though and many prominent public figures actively encourage and support the work that they do, among them the former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Dr. Rowan Williams]], who describes the organisation's aims as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A small but hugely significant witness, telling someone that they are not facing death alone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'Human Writes' has become generally known and accepted by the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|US prison authorities]] as a reputable organisation, working within the parameters of their systems.

The '''ISDA Master Agreement''' is the most commonly used [[master service agreements|master service agreement]] for [[Over-the-counter (finance)|OTC]] [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] [[financial transaction|transaction]]s internationally. It is part of a framework of documents, designed to enable OTC derivatives to be documented fully and flexibly. The framework consists of a master agreement, a schedule, confirmations, definition booklets, and credit support documentation. The ISDA master agreement is published by the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]].

The master agreement is a [[legal instrument|document]] agreed between two parties that sets out standard terms that apply to all the transactions entered into between those parties. Each time that a transaction is entered into, the terms of the master agreement do not need to be re-negotiated and apply automatically.

Although it is often viewed as a tool for [[bank]]s and [[financial institution]]s, the Master Agreement is widely used by a wide variety of [[counterparty|counterparties]].

== Advantages ==

The master agreement is quite lengthy, and the [[negotiation]] process can be burdensome, but once a master agreement is signed, the documentation of future transactions between parties is reduced to a brief confirmation of the material terms of the transaction.

The master agreement also aids in reducing disputes by providing extensive resources defining its [[Contractual term|terms]] and explaining the [[intent (law)|intent]] of the contract, thereby preventing [[legal dispute|disputes]] from beginning as well as providing a neutral resource to interpret standard contractual terms. Finally, the master agreement greatly aids in risk and credit management for the parties.

== History ==

The ISDA Master Agreement is a development of the Swaps Code, introduced by ISDA in 1985 and updated in 1986. In its earliest form, it consisted of standard definitions, representations and warranties, events of default, and remedies.

In 1987, ISDA produced three documents: (i) a standard form master agreement for U.S. dollar interest-rate swaps; (ii) a standard form master agreement for multi-currency interest-rate and currency swaps (collectively known as the "1987 ISDA Master Agreement"); and (iii) the interest rate and currency definitions.

The 1990s resulted in major document production by ISDA, including (i) a revised version of the Swaps Code, known as the 1991 ISDA Definitions, drafted and replaced later by the 2000 ISDA Definitions; (ii) a revision to the 1987 Master Agreement resulting in the 1992 Master Agreement; (iii) the User's Guide to the 1992 Master Agreement, drafted in 1993, explaining in detail each section of the 1992 Master Agreement; (iv) the Commodities Derivatives Definitions, drafted in 1993 and supplemented in 2000; and (v) the Annex, providing for collateral documentation, finalised in 1994, followed by its User's Guide in 1995.

The Master Agreement was updated again in 2002 (known as the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement). The move to update the 1992 Agreement had its origins in the succession of crises that affected the global financial markets in the late 1990s. These events, including the liquidation of Hong Kong broker-dealer [[Peregrine Investments Holdings]] and the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], tested the ISDA documentation to a previously unseen degree. Although the ISDA documentation withstood that test, ISDA decided to establish a strategic review of its documentation to see what lessons could be learned from these events. This review led, in time, to the full-scale update of 1992 Agreement, which culminated in the 2002 Agreement.

== Document architecture ==
The master agreement is the central document around which the rest of the ISDA documentation structure is built. The preprinted master agreement is never altered except to insert the names of the parties, but is customised through use of the schedule to the master agreement, a document containing elections, additions and amendments to the master agreement.

Together with the schedule, the master agreement sets forth all of the general terms and conditions necessary to properly allocate the risks of the transactions between the parties but does not contain any commercial terms specific to a particular transaction. Once the master agreement is executed, the parties can enter into numerous transactions by agreeing to the material commercial terms over the telephone as evidenced by a written confirmation without any need to revisit the underlying terms contained in the master agreement.

There are two versions of the Master Agreement, the local version for transactions between parties located in the same [[jurisdiction]] who are transacting in only one [[currency]], and the multicurrency version for use when parties are located in different jurisdictions transacting in different currencies. The provisions included in the multicurrency version but not in the local currency version concern issues such as [[tax]]es, currency of payment, the use of multiple [[office]]s to enter into transactions, and the designation of an [[law of agency|agent]] for [[service of process]].{{cref|a}}

=== Single agreement ===

Section 1(c) of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties ... and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This single agreement concept is integral to the structure and forms part of the netting based protection offered by the master agreement. The fact that all transactions are the one contract reinforces the ability to close out those transactions and come up with a single net amount payable if a default occurs.

=== Events of default and termination events ===

Section 5 of the ISDA Master Agreement contains the "Events of Default" and the "Termination Events". These are events which can lead to termination of transactions before their intended [[maturity (finance)|maturity]].
 
The Events of Default can be described in summary as events for which a party is at [[fault (legal)|fault]], such as a failure to perform under a transaction, breach of a representation or undertaking, and [[insolvency]].

The Termination Events are other events which, although no-one is at fault, warrant the early termination of the transactions, such as a change in tax law resulting in taxes being imposed on transactions, illegality, and a merger of a party resulting in a deterioration in its credit quality. Parties may also elect to specify Additional Termination Events in the Schedule, such as a decline in a corporate party's [[credit rating]] or a decline in a hedge fund's [[Net asset value]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.derivsdocu.com/blog/2013/11/11/common-provisions-negotiated-in-the-isda-master-agreement-part-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Close out and netting ===

Section 6 of the ISDA Master Agreement contains the provisions which enable a party to terminate transactions early if an Event of Default or Termination Event occurs in respect of the other party and set out the procedure to calculate and net the termination values of those transactions to produce a single amount payable between the parties.

There are two elections that the parties make in the Schedule which affect the operation of these provisions:
* whether the party not at fault is required to pay if the net termination amount is worked out to be payable to the party at fault. This is a choice of payment method between "First Method" (under which the party not at fault does not need to pay) and "Second Method" (under which the party not at fault is required to pay);
* whether the termination values for the transaction will be determined by obtaining quotes from dealers in the market for replacement transactions or by the party not at fault working out how much it has lost or gained as a result of early termination. This is a choice of payment measure between "Market Quotation" and "Loss".

The above only applies in relation to the 1992 Master Agreement. The 2002 Master Agreement did away with First and Second method. In practice First Method was very rarely opted for because its use required the relevant financial institutions to report their gross, rather than net, exposure under the Master Agreement. The 2002 Master Agreement also replaced the distinction between Market Quotation and Loss with a single concept, "Close-out Amount". This is determined in respect of each Terminated Transaction and is, broadly, the profit or loss which would be made in incurred on entering into an equivalent Transaction as of the Early Termination Date. The aggregate of the Close-out Amounts and Unpaid Amounts is referred to as the "Early Termination Amount". This is the net amount payable by one party to the other in respect of the Terminated Transactions.

=== Taxation ===

Section 2(d) of the ISDA Master Agreement contains provisions setting out the consequences if a tax is imposed on a payment required to be made by a party under a transaction. Included is a gross-up obligation for certain "Indemnifiable Taxes". This interlocks with other provisions in the ISDA Master Agreement, such as the taxation representations contained in ss 3(e) and 3(f), undertakings in ss 4(a) and 4(d), and termination events in ss 5(b)(ii) and 5(b)(iii). These provisions are extremely complex and great care is usually taken by negotiators to ensure that the result is not the opposite of what was intended.

The range of taxation matters which can be relevant to particular derivative transactions include [[interest withholding tax]], [[withholding tax|quasi-withholding tax]], [[Value added tax|goods and services tax]] and [[stamp duty]].

=== Multi-branch issues ===

Section 10 of the ISDA Master Agreement addresses issues that arise in connection with counterparties that enter into transactions through more than one office or branch and more than one jurisdiction.

== Related documents ==

=== Schedule ===

The Schedule and Paragraph 13 are used to make all amendments to and customisations of the Master Agreement and Annex, including the elections of the various options presented to the parties in the Master Agreement and Annex and the addition of provisions not contained in the Master Agreement. It contains:
* the elections referred to in the Master Agreement, such as the payment measures and methods, the thresholds relating to certain events of default,and the offices through which parties can act;
* any amendments that the parties agree to make to the terms of the Master Agreement; and
* any additional terms that the parties want to include, such as a set-off clause between close-out amounts and amounts owing under other contracts.

The printed form of the Master Agreement is never amended on the face of the document. In negotiations it is not even exchanged, on the presumption that the standard terms will always be used.

=== Credit support documentation ===

There are various standard forms of credit support documentation prepared by ISDA.  The key distinctions between each include their governing law (English, New York and Japanese) and method of transfer of collateral (title transfer and security interest).

The main credit support documents governed by English law are the 1995 Credit Support Annex, the 1995 Credit Support Deed and the 2016 Credit Support Annex for Variation Margin.  The English law Credit Support Annexes provide for title transfer collateral, whereas the English law Credit Support Deed provides for a security interest to be granted over transferred collateral.  The 2016 Credit Support Annex for Variation Margin has been specifically introduced to allow parties to comply with their obligations to exchange Variation Margin in accordance with margin regimes around the world, including [[European Market Infrastructure Regulation|EMIR]] in Europe and [[Dodd-Frank]] in the United States of America.  The English law Credit Support Annexes are Confirmations, and the transactions constituted by them are Transactions, under the Master Agreement and therefore form part of the single agreement together with the Master Agreement.  The English law Credit Support Deed, on the other hand, is a separate agreement between the parties.

The use of one or more credit support documents is optional but is common in Master Agreements for OTC derivative transactions. Credit support documentation is added where parties wish to provide for the exchange of [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] if the exposure (under the derivative transactions covered by the credit support document) of one party to the other exceeds an agreed amount. The credit support documentation contains provisions concerning the posting and return of collateral, the types of collateral that may be used, and the treatment of collateral by the recipient.

=== Confirmations ===

Derivatives transactions are usually entered into orally or electronically and the contract between the parties is formed at this time. The evidence of the terms of the transaction is contained in a confirmation (also known as a trading advice or contract note), usually a short letter, fax or email. The form of the confirmation is set out in the Master Agreement and a limited period of time is usually allowed for objections or amendments to the confirmation after its receipt. Confirmations are usually very short (except for complex transactions) and contain little more than dates, amounts, and rates. Confirmations are exchanged to minimise the possibility of a dispute as to the terms of a transaction occurring.

=== Definitions ===

ISDA has produced a wide array of supporting materials for the Master Agreement, including definitions and user's guides. This documentation is designed to prevent disputes and to facilitate the consistent use and interpretation of the Master Agreement. These materials are produced by ISDA and are regularly updated to reflect the most recent regulatory or market changes.

Each type of derivative transaction, such as [[credit derivative]], currency derivatives, and equity derivatives have their own definitional booklet.

== Legal issues ==

=== Netting ===

The Master Agreement allows parties to calculate their [[financial exposure]] under OTC transactions on a net basis, i.e. a party calculates the difference between what it owes to a counterparty under a Master Agreement and what the counterparty owes it under the same agreement.

These calculations are made on a [[mark-to-market]] basis to reflect the current position of each transaction.

The Master Agreement permits the netting of payments due under the same transaction so that only a single amount is exchanged between the parties, rather than numerous payments involving the same transactions. Most counterparties also agree to net all amounts due on a single day regardless of whether amounts are due under a single or multiple transactions.

=== Set-off ===

Set-off is used as a final settlement of accounts that extinguishes the mutual debts owed between the parties in exchange for a new, net amount due. The parties are incentivized to pay in a timely manner by the imposition of [[interest]] on any amounts paid after the due date.

In support of this practice, the [[Title 11 of the United States Code|United States Bankruptcy Code]] exempts participants in OTC derivative transactions from the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and permits them to set-off obligations owed between the [[creditor]] and the bankrupt party even during the pendency of a bankruptcy stay order.

=== Authority and capacity ===

The principles for resolving the issue as to whether an individual has the authority to bind the company are not special to derivatives, they are derived from traditional [[agency law]]. In essence it is necessary to examine the relevant circumstances to determine whether the individual had the actual or apparent authority to bind the company to the transaction. It is common for parties to exchange authorised signatory lists of persons who have authority to execute confirmations and refer to this in the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement. However, this does not mean that this is determinative of the authority issue, and a person not on one of these lists may have the authority to sign a confirmation. As a matter of market practice, this issue is dealt with on the understanding that institutions are responsible for their own internal authorisation matters and that any person who is held out as being able to enter into OTC derivative transactions has the apparent authority to do so.

=== Reliance and suitability ===

One area in which a party to an OTC transaction can be attacked by its counterparty, if the transactions "goes south", is if the counterparty was relying on the party in relation to the transaction and the party owes either some kind of fiduciary relationship to the counterparty or has engaged in misleading conduct in inducing the counterparty to enter into the trade. In this regard the principles of equity, contract, and trade practices law apply to OTC derivatives in the same way as they apply to other contracts.

Parties try to limit this responsibility by including "non-reliance" representations in their agreements, to the effect that each is not relying on the other and they are making their own independent decisions. Whilst these representations are useful, they would not prevent an action under trade practices legislation nor other actions if the conduct of a party was inconsistent with this representation.

=== Termination ===

While set-off provisions provides a creditor some relief from a counterparty's bankruptcy by permitting the set-off of obligations due and owing, it does not provide relief from the exposure to future positions that have not yet become due and owing. In recognition of this problem, the Master Agreement contains provisions permitting a creditor party to terminate and liquidate transactions upon a counterparty's bankruptcy or other default under the Master Agreement (acceleration).

The Master Agreement provides the parties two means by which the Master Agreement and all transactions thereunder may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events. The first is the occurrence of an [[event of default]], which permits a party to terminate the Master Agreement and liquidate all transactions if the other party is affected by an Event of Default. In contrast, Termination Events may affect both parties, are usually the result of the actions of third parties, and may provide the affected party a [[grace period]] to cure the Termination Event before the other party may terminate and liquidate the Master Agreement.

== '''In popular culture''' ==
In the movie "The Big Short", which is based on Michael Lewis' book by the same name, ISDA Master Agreement is referred as the Hunting License, reserved only for the big boys. Originally devised with the banks and other institutional players in mind, the doors were opened to ultra-high networth individuals. The maximum licenses at any point peaked at 3000.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-03/inside-the-world-s-most-elite-and-secret-traders-club|title=Inside the World’s Most Elite (and Secret) Traders’ Club|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; refers to two or more unconnected [[people]], [[organizations]], entities or objects which provide a given set of [[information]] or samples. For example, two separate people who witness a [[traffic accident]], [[wikt:firsthand|first hand]], could be considered independent sources. However, if one person witnessed the accident and told the other one about it, then they would not be ''independent'', since one would ''depend'' on the other for their information. Also, if two witnesses to an event discuss what they saw before they are consulted and agree on a consistent story, then they are also no longer independent. As another example, two scientific devices could be considered independent sources of measurement data, unless they shared the same wiring or electrical power supply (or similar factors).

Consulting multiple independent sources is a common technique for detecting [[error]]s and [[deception]], as any [[divergence]]s or contradictions between statements, or data samples, would likely indicate one of these.

The American judge [[Learned Hand]] declared that "Right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative selection. To many this is, and will always be, folly; but we have staked upon it our all."&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Associated Press 1943. (As cited in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Political Quotations'' 4th ed. (2010) {{ISBN|978-0-19-957267-0}}.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'s'' minimal standard for reporting a fact not otherwise attributed to a single speaker is that it be verified by at least two independent sources.

[[Circular reporting]] is a situation where multiple sources ''appear'' to be independent, but in reality originate from a single source.  Because circular reporting can happen inadvertently in many situations, extra care must be taken to ensure that multiple sources actually are independent, rather than interconnected in an obscure manner.

There are individual town listings for localities throughout both countries.&lt;ref name=BRAMA-JRUkraineMoldava-PressRelease-1999&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krill|first1=A|title=Ukraine opens its archives and a new book is born|url=http://www.brama.com/news/press/991008roots.html|work=BRAMA|date=8 October 1999|format=Press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishWeek-JRUkraineMoldova-1999&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brawarsky|first1=Sandee|title=Our Back Pages: `Jewish Roots' documents life in Ukraine and Moldova|url=http://www.rtrfoundation.org/webart/bookrev1.jpg|work=[[The Jewish Week]]|volume=212|issue=18|date=24 September 1999|location=New York, NY|page=47|issn=0745-5356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book includes an inventory of 1,392 towns and over 5,000 record entries for these towns. Sources of the material were the Ukrainian State Archives, Moldova National Archives, Ministry of Justice (ZAGS) in Ukraine and Moldova, Polish State Archives (AGAD in Warsaw), Urzad Stanu Cywilnego (Warsaw-Srodmiescie), and the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. There are over 1,200 images in the book, of which there are 970 color photos of 190 towns, 121 black and white photos, 115 document examples, and 20 color maps.&lt;ref name=UkrainianWeekly-Book-UkraineMoldova-1999&gt;{{cite journal|title=Book Note: Major genealogical reference book released|journal=[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]|date=24 October 1999|volume=LXVII|issue=43|url=http://ukrweekly.com/archive/1999/The_Ukrainian_Weekly_1999-43.pdf|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archives of Ukraine and Moldova were not accessible to the public for genealogical research purposes until the two countries gained independence in 1991. Once available, the ability to access even one birth record could take more than a week. Weiner made repeated visits to Ukraine and was aided by the former mayor of [[Otaci]], Moldova, who served as a driver and translator.&lt;ref name=JewishWeek-JRUkraineMoldova-1999 /&gt; The book and the Routes to Roots Archive Database are the only known town-by-town inventories of archival documents (published in English) in that these lists were officially sanctioned by the directors of the both the State Archives and Ministry of Justice (includes local town hall archives) in Ukraine and

''Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova'' took over seven years to complete.&lt;ref name=UkrainianWeekly-Launch-UkraineMoldova-1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarosewich|first1=Irene|title=New York City launch for publication "Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova"|journal=[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]|date=24 October 1999|volume=LXVII|issue=43|url=http://ukrweekly.com/archive/1999/The_Ukrainian_Weekly_1999-43.pdf|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner worked with two directors of the State Archives of Ukraine, Borys Ivanenko and Dr. Ruslan Pyrih, and collaborated with archivists throughout Ukraine to compile the information for the book.&lt;ref name=BRAMA-JRUkraineMoldava-PressRelease-1999 /&gt; The Director of the Moldovan National Archives, Antonina A.

== Reception ==
[[File:Miriam Weiner in the Kiev Historical Archives in Ukraine points to boxes of historic documents dating back several hundred years, Aug 1991.jpg|thumb|300px|Miriam Weiner in the Kiev Historical Archives in Ukraine points to boxes of historic documents dating back several hundred years, Aug 1991]]
''Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova'' was the first work of its kind, as it collected details on archival documents from Ukraine and Moldova that had previously been deemed inaccessible or fundamentally lost. The book also serves multiple functions, so its diversity of offerings often made categorizing what the book was difficult. In the New York Jewish Genealogical Society, Inc.'s publication, ''DOROT,'' their detailed review focused on the extensive scope of the materials presented in the book: over 1,200 images of almost 200 towns, and the inclusion of over 5,000 documents of almost 1,400 towns.&lt;ref name=DOROT-Review-UkraineModova-1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedlander|first1=Alex E.|title=Book Reviews: Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova: Pages From the Past and Archival Inventories|journal=DOROT|date=Fall 1999|volume=21|issue=1|pages=11–12|url=http://www.jgsny.org/index.php/publications/dorot/dorot-archive/50-fall-1999/file|publisher=Jewish Genealogical Society, Inc.|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jewish Standard]]'' noted the fact that ''Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova'' presents a wide range of information that is both useful and interesting.&lt;ref name=JewishStandard-Review-UkraineMoldova-2000&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wahrman|first1=Miryam|title=Routes to Roots: New Guide Offers Resources for Research in Ukraine and Moldova|url=http://www.wahrman.org/MIRY409.htm|work=[[Jewish Standard]]|date=4 February 2000|location=Teaneck, NJ|pages=31, 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the book for being lavishly illustrated, voluminous encyclopedic guides that provide glimpses of life in Poland before [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Review-UkraineMoldova-2000&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blumenthal|first1=Ralph|title=Travel Advisory; Guides That Help Trace Jewish Roots|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/23/travel/travel-advisory-guides-that-help-trace-jewish-roots.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[New York City]] book launch that was held at the Consulate of Ukraine in September 1999, Dr. Ruslan Pyrih, director of the Main Archival Administration of Ukraine, stressed the importance of the book not just from a genealogical perspective, but from a historical perspective.&lt;ref name=UkrainianWeekly-Launch-UkraineMoldova-1999 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7308">[[Image:009MA Kritios.jpg|thumb|''Kritios Boy''. Marble, c. 480 BC. ''Acropolis Museum'', Athens.]]
The marble '''Kritios Boy''' or '''Kritian Boy''' belongs to the Early Classical period of [[ancient Greek sculpture]]. It is the first statue from [[classical antiquity]] known to use [[contrapposto]];&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 139. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Clark]] called it "the first beautiful nude in art"&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]]. (2010) ''The Nude: A study in ideal form''. New edition. London: [[The Folio Society]], pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, even likely, that earlier Bronze statues had used the technique, but if they did, they have not survived&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; and Susan Woodford has speculated that the statue is a copy of a Bronze original.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;Woodford, Susan. (1982) ''The Art of Greece and Rome''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], pp. 13-14. {{ISBN|0521298733}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kritios Boy is thus named because it is attributed, on slender evidence,&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; to [[Kritios]] who worked together with [[Nesiotes]] (sculptors of ''[[Harmodius and Aristogeiton (sculpture)|Harmodius and Aristogeiton]]'') or their school, from around 480 BC. As currently mounted, the statue is considerably smaller than life-size at c. 86&amp;nbsp;cm (3&amp;nbsp;ft 10 ins),&lt;ref name=Janson/&gt;&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''.7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 122. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the supports that replace the missing feet.

==Discovery==
The statue was excavated in 1866 on the [[Acropolis of Athens]], among the "[[Perserschutt]]", the ceremonial dump in which the Athenians buried the debris of sacred artefacts destroyed by the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece#September 480 BC: Salamis|marauding Persian army]] in 480 BC. It is on display in the [[Acropolis Museum]], Athens,&lt;ref&gt;Inv. no. 698.&lt;/ref&gt; near the site where it was excavated. The torso was found in 1865 while excavating the foundation of the old museum at the Athenian Acropolis. The head of this statue was found twenty-three years later between the museum and the Acropolis south wall, in the latest stage of the rubble of destruction undergone in the [[Persian Wars]]. This fact, in conjunction with the analysis of its style, is essential to the dating of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey M. Hurwitt, "The Kritios Boy: Discovery, Reconstruction, and Date", in: ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''93''' (1989), pp. 41-80. For the destruction of the Athenian Acropolis generally: Martin Steskal, "Der Zerstörungsbefund 480/79 der Athener Akropolis" ''Eine Fallstudie zum etablierten Chronologygerüst'', Hamburg 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Whether or not Kritios was the innovator,&lt;ref&gt;Literary sources credit [[Pythagoras of Rhegium]] as the sculptor who "first gave rhythm and proportion to his statues," as Kenneth Clark noted.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Kritios Boy (''[[ephebos]]'') the Greek artist has mastered a complete understanding of how the different parts of the body act as a system. The statue moves away from the rigid and stiff pose of the Archaic style. Kritios Boy presents a more relaxed and naturalistic pose known as [[contrapposto]]. This stance forces a chain of anatomical events: as the pelvis is pushed diagonally upwards on the left side, the right buttock relaxes, the spine acquires an "S" curve, and the shoulder line dips on the left to counteract the action of the pelvis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/437054149|title=Art across time|last=Laurie.|first=Adams,|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=|isbn=9780073379234|edition=4th|location=New York|pages=144–145|oclc=437054149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among classic Greek sculptures, the Kritios Boy expresses the "[[Polyclitean canon|Canon]] of [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]]" and his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gisela Richter|Richter, Gisela M.A.]] (1966) ''Handbuch der griechischen Kunst''. Berlin: Köln-Berlin, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boardman (art historian)|Boardman, John]]. Ed. (1993) ''The Oxford History of Classical Art''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Hier bitte 2 Leerzeilen lassen, da sonst das Inhaltsverzeichnis zu nahe an den Text gerückt ist --&gt;

It set the rule for later sculptors like [[Praxiteles]] and [[Lysippos]], whose contrapposto, or ponderation, is more emphasised than the "subtle equilibrium of outline and axis which is to be the basis of classical art"&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; exhibited by the Kritios Boy's "delicate balance of movement"&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;

The Kritios Boy exhibits a number of other critical innovations that distinguish it from the [[Kouros|Archaic ''Kouroi'']] from the seventh and sixth century BC that paved its way. The Archaic style relied more on geometrical shapes to define the contours of the human body. The muscular and skeletal structure of Kritios Boy are depicted with unforced lifelike accuracy of flesh and bone, with the rib cage naturally expanded as if in the act of breathing, with a relaxed attitude and hips which are distinctly narrower. Sculptors had begun to break away from the rules of the Archaic style and follow representation that was closer to nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/957252376|title=Greek art|last=1927-|first=Boardman, John,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780500204337|edition=Fifth edition, revised and expanded|location=London|pages=140|oclc=957252376}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a final forebear of the classical period, the [[Archaic smile|"smile" of Archaic statues]] has been completely replaced by the accurate rendering of the lips and the austere expression that characterized the transitional [[Severe style]]. It was created in same era as the [[Blond Kouros's Head of the Acropolis]] and the group of the "[[Tyrannicide]]s" [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]]. A good example for  comparison is the marble statue of an ''ephebos'' in the museum in [[Agrigento]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2204">"'''Letter to a Priest'''" ({{lang-fr|Lettre à un religieux}}) is a letter containing thirty-five, "expressions of opinion on matters concerning [[Catholic]] faith, dogma and institutions", by the French religious and social philosopher and mystic [[Simone Weil]]. It was first published in 1951 by [[Éditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], and an English edition followed in 1953. It has since been republished several times in book form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Weil: "''When I read [[Roman Catechism|The Catechism of the Council of Trent]], it seems as though I had nothing in common with the religion there set forth. [...] I am going to enumerate for you a certain number of thoughts which have dwelt in me for years (some of them at least) and which form a barrier between me and the Church.''"

Weil scholar George Panichas writes that the letter reflects Weil's profound disagreement with official Catholic dogma, but also shows that her heart belongs to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter was addressed to a French priest living in [[New York City|New York]], the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Fr. Édouard Couturier, when Simone Weil herself was staying there in the autumn of 1942. She was anxious at this time to return to Europe to join the [[Free French Forces|Free French Movement]] of [[Charles de Gaulle]] in London,&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, Mario von der Ruhr, p. vii, ''Letter to a Priest'', Routledge edition, 2002 {{ISBN|0-415-26767-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; even wishing to be parachuted into France to aid the [[French Resistance]].

'''Love magic''' is celebrating one's love for the self, and being the love that is wanted form another. Romantic love requests an equal partner to enjoy sex. It can be implemented in a variety of ways, such as written spells, dolls, charms, [[amulet]]s, [[potion]]s, or different rituals.

Love magic has been a branch of magical practice, and a topos in literature and art, for many centuries. It is attested on [[cuneiform]] tablets from the ancient [[Near East]], in [[ancient Egypt]]ian texts, in the [[Ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world, the Middle Ages, and up to the present day. It is used in the story of [[Heracles]] and [[Deianeira]], also in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Tristan and Isolde]]'', [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[The Elixir of Love]]'' (''L'Elisir d'amore''), and [[Manuel de Falla]]'s ballet ''[[El amor brujo]]'' (The magic of love).

==Ancient love magic==

The earliest attestations of love magic derive from the ancient Near East, dating to ca. 2200 BCE. Cuneiform tablets preserving rituals of erotic magic have been uncovered at Tell Inghara and Isin (present day Iraq).&lt;ref name="R. Pientka, ‘Aphrodisiaka und Liebeszauber im Alten Orient’, in S. Parpola and R.M. Whiting (eds.), ''Sex and Gender in the Ancient Near East'' (2 vols; Helsinki, 2002), vol. II, pp. 507-522."&gt;R. Pientka, ‘Aphrodisiaka und Liebeszauber im Alten Orient’, in S. Parpola and R.M. Whiting (eds.), ''Sex and Gender in the Ancient Near East'' (2 vols; Helsinki, 2002), vol. II, pp. 507-522.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rituals are attested in ancient Egypt, for instance on an ostracon dated to the twentieth dynasty (twelfth-eleventh centuries BCE).&lt;ref name="J.F. Borghouts, ''Ancient Egyptian Magical Texts'' (Leiden, 1978), p. 1."&gt;[[Joris Borghouts|J.F. Borghouts]], ''Ancient Egyptian Magical Texts'' (Leiden, 1978), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hellenistic love magic==

Spells of erotic attraction and compulsion are found within the [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|syncretic magic tradition]] of [[Hellenistic Greece]], which incorporated [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] and [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world#Jewish tradition|Hebraic]] elements, as documented in texts such as the [[Greek Magical Papyri]] and archaeologically on [[amulet]]s and other artefacts dating from the 2nd century BC (and sometimes earlier) to the late 3rd century A.D. These magical practices continued to influence private ritual in [[Gaul]] among Celtic peoples, in [[Roman Britain]], and among [[Germanic peoples]].&lt;ref name="p. 52ff"&gt;For example, J.H.G. Grattan and Charles Singer, ''Anglo-Saxon Magic and Medicine. Illustrated Specially from the Semi-Pagan Text Lacnunga'' (Oxford University Press, 1952); Felix Grendon, ''Anglo-Saxon Charms'' (Folcroft Library, 1974), ''passim'' (mostly on Christian elements and traditional magic); Anne van Arsdall, ''Medieval Herbal Remedies: The'' Old English Herbarium ''and Anglo-Saxon Medicine'' (Routledge, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ITxsaqEmVHAC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22anglo-saxon+magic%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3#PPA53,M1 p. 52ff.], with cautions about disentangling various strands of the magical tradition; Karen Louise Jolly, “Locating the Charms: Medicine, Liturgy, and Folklore,” in ''Popular Religion in Late Saxon England'' (University of North Caroline Press, 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=P7LqtqbohIsC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=%22glimpse+into+the+intermingling%22+intitle:Late+intitle:Saxon+intitle:England+inauthor:Jolly&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 p. 96ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; Erotic magic reflected gender roles in ancient Greece and dismissed{{Clarify|date=September 2009}} modern misconceptions about gender roles and sexuality. Christopher Faraone, a University of Chicago classics professor specializing in texts and practices pertaining to magic, distinguishes between the magic of ''[[eros]]'', as practiced by men, and the magic of ''[[philia]]'', practiced by women.&lt;ref name="Paul C. Rosenblatt, pg. 482"&gt;Paul C. Rosenblatt, pg. 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two types of spells can be connected directly to the gender roles of men and women in Ancient Greece. Women used philia spells because they were dependent on their husbands. Women were powerless and used any means necessary to keep their husbands around, since men were free to leave their wives whenever they wanted. Many women resorted to philia spells to maintain their beauty and keep a peace of mind.

Philia magic was used by women to keep their male companion at bay and faithful.&lt;ref name="p. 52ff"/&gt; Basic beliefs about sexual attitudes in Greece were dismissed by the findings in the philia love spells, potions, and rituals. The spells were not used by women to achieve sexual pleasure, but rather as a form of therapy or medicine. Women commonly used the philia spells in attempt to preserve their beauty and youth, which in effect would keep their beau faithful. Parallels can be drawn between philia spells and common medical practice by women.&lt;ref name="Paul C. Rosenblatt, pg. 482-7"&gt;Paul C. Rosenblatt, pg. 482-7&lt;/ref&gt; Getting a face lift serves the same purpose as the philia spell. A facelift will make a woman feel desirable and inject her with youth, at least in her mind. Many women in ancient Greece used the spells as a form of therapy. Regardless if the spells actually worked or not, they made the women feel more comfortable with their situation and feel as if they have some control over what is going on. In that sense, magic functions the same way religions do. Spells and prayer share many of the same characteristics; both are used to bring peace of mind and they both invoke something spiritual to control something that is ultimately out of their hands.

Eros spells were mainly practiced by men and prostitutes served a completely different function in Ancient Greece. Eros spells were used to instill lust and passion into women, leading them to fulfill the man who invoked the spells sexual desires. Without freedom, women could only hope to make their situation better, which is why they aimed at affection producing spells. Men, on the other hand, had the freedom to do what they want.&lt;ref name="Matthew W. Dickie, pg. 564"&gt;Matthew W. Dickie, pg. 564&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitutes lived lives that were far more similar to men than women. They were financially free, could live where they chose, and were not expected to serve just one man and home. These were the only noted women to use eros magic to fulfill their sexual needs.

== Love magic in the Renaissance ==
[[File:Der Liebeszauber by Niederrheinischer Meister.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Painting from the lower Rhine, 1470–80, showing love magic]]
During the later medieval period (14th to 17th century), [[marriage]] developed into a central institution for public life.  This is reflected in their love magic:while the immediate desire was the act of intercourse itself, it was most often practiced in an attempt for a permanent union such as [[marriage]].  [[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] was expensive and could cause severe damage to the caster; therefore it was not taken lightly.&lt;ref name="Paul C. Rosenblatt, pg. 482-7"/&gt;  Thus, spells were not just cast upon just anyone in the [[Renaissance]], but on those unions that held special importance.  Men and women of status and favor were more often the targets of love magic.  Economic or [[social class]] restrictions would often inhibit a [[marriage]], and love magic was seen as a way to break those barriers, leading to social advancement.&lt;ref name="Matthew W. Dickie, pg. 564"/&gt;

While the spells were supposed to be kept secret, very rarely were they successful in this.  However, if the victim realized that a spell was being cast upon them, believing in magic themselves, they would behave differently adding effectiveness to love magic.&lt;ref name="Paul C. Rosenblatt, pg. 482-7"/&gt;  This communication of one's desire is essential within the concept of love magic as it enabled a timid person to approach the unapproachable.

With the dominance of [[Christianity]] and [[Catholicism]] in Europe during the [[Renaissance]], elements of [[Christianity]] seeped its way into the magic rituals themselves.  Often, clay dolls or written spell scrolls would be hidden in the altar at churches, or holy candles would be lit in the rituals.  The Host from a [[Catholic Mass]] would sometimes be taken and used in rituals to gain the desired result.  Thus, love magic within the [[Renaissance]] period was both [[Christian]] and [[Paganism|pagan]].&lt;ref&gt;Guido Ruggiero pg.225&lt;/ref&gt;

== Love magic in literature and art ==
In literature and art, the motif of a genuine love spell is interwoven more often, and made the starting point of tragic setbacks and complications. One of the earliest manifestations of the theme in the Western world is the story of [[Heracles]] and [[Deianeira]]. A famous treatment of the subject is in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Tristan and Isolde]]'', which in turn goes back to the same epic by [[Gottfried von Strassburg]]. Other examples of the use of love magic motif are [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[The Elixir of Love]]'' (''L'Elisir d'amore'') and [[Manuel de Falla]]'s ballet ''[[El amor brujo]]'' (The magic of love).

== Women in love magic ==
Love magic was seen as drawing “…heavily upon what was perceived as quintessentially feminine: fertility, birth, menstruation (seen as closely related to both fertility and birth), and a woman’s ‘nature’ or ‘shameful parts,’ that is, genitals”.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Ruggiero pg.114&lt;/ref&gt;  This feminine attribute is reflected within the literature such as the [[Malleus Maleficarum]], and in the trials of the [[Holy Office]] in which most of the cases brought before the council were women accused of bewitching men.  This illustrates the common stereotype that men did not do magic.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew W. Dickie pg.564&lt;/ref&gt;  According to historians Guido Ruggiero and Christopher A. Faraone, love magic often was associated with prostitutes and courtesans.  Women in these professions often held psychological power over their partners, sometimes leading to dramatic measures such as witchcraft accusations.

The view of women within the Renaissance can best be illustrated by the Malleus Maleficarum.  In the opening section of this text it discusses the sexuality of women in relation to the devil. Heinrich Kramer wrote within his book that, "All witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which in women is insatiable." &lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrige, ''Malleus Maleficarum''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Men of the Renaissance feared the sexual power of the opposing gender.  They associated it with the devil, making witches out to be sexual partners with demons.  Kramer makes the case that a witch received her powers by inviting the devil to enter into carnal relations.  Through her sexuality she gains her power, and thus her sexuality is seen as evil and something to be feared.  In many of the witchcraft accusations brought before the Holy Office in the Roman Inquisition, men accused women of binding their passions and sexuality by the use of their own sexuality.

While within literature, females dominate the witch world, some scholars believe that reality was much different.  Matthew W. Dickie, a prominent magic scholar, argues that men were the main casters of love magic.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew W. Dickie, pg.563&lt;/ref&gt;  Demographically, they suggest that the largest age group that practiced love magic were younger men targeting young, unobtainable women.  There are a variety of explanations for why the literary world contrasted reality in this area, but a common interpretation is that men were trying to subtract themselves from association.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew W. Dickie, pg.564&lt;/ref&gt;  Magic was no place for a man, and thus in literature they portrayed themselves as such.

Commissioned by [[King Jeongjo]] (r. 1740–1810) in 1790, the '''''Muyedobotongji''''' (or ''Muye Tobo Tong Ji'', translating to  "Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts")
expanded on the eighteen weapons systems identified in the ''[[Muyeshinbo]]'' of 1758.

Written by [[Yi Deokmu]] (이덕무, 1741–1793), [[Pak Je-ga]] (박제가, 1750–1805) and [[Baek Dong-soo]] (백동수, 1743–1816), and published in four volumes in 1795, it preserved the methods and practices of the earlier work while adding [[horsemanship|equestrian training]] by executing six of the earlier weapons on horseback (마상육기 馬上六技 or 마상6기), extending the system to "twenty-four [martial arts] methods" ([무예]이십사  / [武藝]二十四技)
&lt;!--also (based on ko-wiki): 이십사기,  무예24기  or   무예이십사반 武藝二十四般  (replacing 사/技 "skill" by  반/般 "category")--&gt;
 
While little more than a field manual for cataloguing required skills, the ''Muyedobotongji'' is widely regarded as a resource for understanding the nature of Korean military science in the 18th century.

==Background==

As a result of the high frequency of warfare experienced in Northeast Asia, and in particular the destructive nature of the large number of invasions suffered by the Korean Peninsula, the majority of any documentation of Korean indigenous martial techniques and combat styles has been lost. Much of modern-day scholarship related to the classical or pre-modern Korean martial arts, in particular those that predate the [[Mongol invasions of Korea]] (during which Korean palaces and libraries that would have contained many documents germane to the study of martial arts and combat self-defense were destroyed), relies on the study of the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' compiled by the scholar [[Kim Bu-sik]] and the ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'' compiled by the Buddhist monk [[Iryeon]]. Both works suggest that militant attitudes between and among the three major nations of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korean Three Kingdoms Period]] (37 BCE - 660 AD) resulted in each nation developing an institution for training its warriors in martial arts and military sciences.{{citation needed|date = January 2016}}

The end of vassaldom to the Mongol [[Yuan Dynasty]] in the mid-1300s did not bring peace to the Korean Peninsula. The withdrawal/retreat of Mongol hegemony roughly coincided with the collapse of the [[Kamakura Shogunate]] in Japan; the resultant instability and the relative lack of control exerted by the subsequent [[Ashikaga Shogunate]] led to an increase of incursions by coastal raiding forces, mostly from the Japanese islands. These pirate attacks, as well as raids from the uncontrolled regions in southern Manchuria, provided the Korean state (first as [[Goryeo]] and later as [[Joseon]]) with some rationale for rebuilding Korean military installations and units.{{citation needed|date = January 2016}} However, as a whole, the ascendance of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in Korea in 1392 and the installation of [[Neo-Confucianism]] as its guiding philosophy meant that academics, civil pursuits, and cultural arts were overwhelmingly emphasized at the expense of martial arts and military pursuits. As a result, many national and local defense structures, as well as the training and practice of armed combat, was limited and just sufficient to repel small-scale raids and tribal attacks.{{citation needed|date = January 2016}}

The [[Japanese invasions of Korea|Japanese campaigns in Korea during 1592-8]]  found a militarily complacent Korea that was woefully unprepared to ward off a major, organized, large-scale military invasion such as the one ordered by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. While elements of the Korean court had attempted to update and otherwise revitalize lackluster Korean military resources, they were frequently opposed by rival factions and therefore unable to make substantive improvements in Korean national defenses on a wide scale until the Japanese invasion demonstrated the need for such an emphasis. In September 1593, after the initial Japanese invasion was stalled and pushed back thanks to [[Ming]] Chinese intervention, King [[Seonjo]] established a "Royal Military Training Agency." Following the cessation of hostilities and the full retreat of Japanese forces in 1598, the Korean government sought to record all material that they had found useful. As a result, the ''Muye jebo'' - 무예제보 (literally “Martial Arts Illustrations”) was published in 1610. The work was compiled by a royal military officer, Han Kyo, and consisted of 6 weapon-based fighting systems. These included the ''gon bang'' (long stick), ''deung pae'' (shield), ''[[nang seon]]'' (multi-tipped spear), ''jang chang'' (long spear), ''dang pa'' (triple-tip spear), and the ''ssang su do'' (two-handed saber). Content related to unarmed combat was not included in this manual.

During the reign of King [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] (r. 1724-1776) the ''Muye jebo'' was revised and supplemented with 12 additional fighting methods by [[Crown Prince Sado]] who originated the term ''ship pal gi'' - 십팔기, 十八技 (“Eighteen Fighting Methods”). Though often confused with Chinese practices of the same name and later 20th century practices, the term coined by Prince Sado, a shortened form of ''[[Muyesinbo|bonjo muye ship pal ban]]'' - 본조무예십팔반, 文章武藝十八般 ("18 Martial Arts Classes of the Yi Dynasty"), identified this collection of 18 fighting systems. This manual contained the original 6 systems of the ''muye jebo'' but also included sections for ''juk chang'' (long bamboo spear), ''gi chang'' (flag spear), ''yeh do'' (short sword), ''wae geum'' (Japanese sword - presumably this was in reference to the [[katana]]), ''gyo jeon bo'' (illustrations of combat), ''jedok geum'' (admiral's sword), ''bon guk geum beop'' (literally "native sword methods"), ''ssang geum'' (literally "twin swords," this referred to dual-wielding of swords in combat), ''wol do'' (literally "moon sword," this referred to the Korean equivalent of the [[naginata]], whose blade was crescent-shaped), ''hyeop do'' (spear sword - the better-known Japanese counterpart would be the [[yari]]), ''pyeon gon'' (flail), and ''gwon beop'' (unarmed combat).

The ''[[Muyesinbo]]'' was revised during the reign of King [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] (r. 1776-1800). The 6 fighting skills that were added were essentially the dismounted methods for such weapons as the spear, sword and flail, which had been described in previous versions for execution from horseback. ''gwon beop'' material was also further modified with the addition of material performed between partners. The material was intended to reflect a combat format in deference to Neo-Confucian thought, by having partners use matched methods which would only produce a "stalemate" rather than a victory of one partner over another. Though ideologically satisfactory, the practice rapidly fell into disuse for its lack of practical combat effectiveness. This revised publication is the ''Muyedobotongji'' (“Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts”) and was published in 1795.

With the advent of firearms as the predominant method of armed conflict, the methods and techniques in the ''Muyedobotongji'' largely became relegated to reference material. Many copies were lost or destroyed, along with much knowledge and practice of Korean military science and martial arts, in the latter years of the Joseon Dynasty, much of this occurring during the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] in the first half of the 20th century.

==Contents==
Volumes 1 through 3 focus primarily on [[polearms]] and [[Korean swordsmanship|swordsmanship]]. The fourth volume covers unarmed combat ([[gwonbeop]] "boxing"), blunt weapons ([[Gun (staff)|staff]] and [[Pyeongon|flail]]) and [[Equestrianism|equestrian skills]].

Original to the 1795 Muyedobotongji are six methods of [[mounted combat]]: Gichang (spear fighting on horseback), Masang Ssanggeom (twin swords on horseback), Masang Woldo (crescent sword on horseback), Masang Pyeongon (flail method on horseback),  Gyeokgu (ball game on horseback), Masang Jae (horsemanship specialties, such as riding stunts commonly seen in [[circus]] acts).

===Volume 1===
#Long spear or lance - [[Jangchang|Jang chang]] ([[Hangul]]: 장창, [[Hanja]]: 長槍) a {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} spear made from the wood of the yew tree. It can also be made from a similarly soft wood, including bamboo in the right climate. It was considered the most effective conventional weapon on the battlefield due to its flexibility and length. The jang chang was widely used in the battle to retake Pyong-yang Fortress during the 1592 war between Chosun (Korea) and Japan.
#Long bamboo spear - [[Jukjangchang|Juk jang chang]] (Hangul: 죽장창, Hanja: 竹長槍) {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} spear tipped with a 4-inch blade where the shaft was made of bamboo, resulting in more flexibility.
#Flagspear - [[Gichang|Gi chang]] (Hangul: 기창, Hanja: 旗槍) A {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} staff with a {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=mid|-long}} blade at the end.
#Trident - [[Dangpa|Dang pa]] (Hangul: 당파, Hanja: 鐺鈀) Trident. The middle spear was longer for deeper penetration.  It is between seven feet, six inches and eighteen feet long and has either an iron or wooden tip.
#Spear on horseback - Gi chang (Hangul: 기창, Hanja: 騎槍) Use of a spear (typically the [[Gichang]]) on horseback.
#Thorny spear - [[Nangseon|Nang seon]] (Hangul: 낭선, Hanja: 狼先) Spear with nine to eleven branches or thorns extending out from the main shaft, each studded with small metal hooks. These thorns could be dipped in poison

===Volume 2===
#Long sword - Ssang su do (Hangul: 쌍수도, Hanja: 雙手刀) Sword that had to be handled with both hands.
#:The long sword is handled with both hands. These frighteningly big, heavy swords were originally called "long swords" (jangdo), or sometimes "applying sword" (yonggum) or "plain sword" (pyunggum). Swords of this type came to be known during invasions of China since they were used by Japanese pirates invading China's coastal areas. Wielding these swords, the Japanese pirates were capable of cutting long spears, or even enemy soldiers, in half with a single stroke. The long sword skills were therefore introduced to Korea in order to prepare its troops for combat against the Japanese pirates.
#Sharp sword - Ye do (Hangul: 예도, Hanja: 銳刀) Also known as dando or hwando. A double-edge sword was called a geom ([[Jian|劍]]) while a single-edged sword was called a do ([[Dao (sword)|刀]]).
#Japanese sword - Wae geom (Hangul: 왜검, Hanja: 倭劍) This chapter describes the use of Japanese swords. Their use was studied during the [[Imjin Waeran]].
#Combat engagement - Kyo jun (Hangul: 교전, Hanja: 交戰) A Japanese method of practicing swordsmanship with a training partner.

===Volume 3===
#Commander sword - [[Jedok geom]] (Hangul: 제독검, Hanja: 提督劍) Was, just like the Yedo, carried around the waist. This sword can thank its name to commander [[Li Rusong]].
#Korean sword - [[Bonguk geom]] (Hangul: 본국검, Hanja: 本國劍) Also known as ''sin geom''; 신검 (combining the first syllable from ''Silla'' [Sin-Ra; 신라; 新羅], which undergoes [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] in normal context, and ''sword'' [Geom; 검; 劍]). This section represented the swords used by the [[hwarang]] from the [[Silla]] dynasty. It bore close resemblance to the double edged sword of the [[Eastern Han]]
#Double sword - Ssang geom (Hangul: 쌍검, Hanja: 雙劍) A set of equally sized swords.
#:A fighting skill using two swords, one in each hand. This was one of the most difficult skills to master. Twin swords on horseback required even greater prowess. The fighter could attack and defend at the same time using two swords. The smaller, saber‐size swords with round hand guards (hwando) were generally used for this technique. The swordsman kept a pair of swords, one referred to as ''male'' (or [[yang (concept)|yang]]) and the other one as ''female'' (or [[yin (concept)|eum]]), in a single scabbard to draw them quickly (note that the ''eum/yang'' designation also applies to ''left'' vs. ''right''). The well-known double swords folk dance ([[Geommu|Ssanggeommu]]) was derived from this skill.
#Double sword on horseback - Masang ssang geom (Hangul: 마상쌍검, Hanja: 馬上雙劍) This chapter describes the use of ssang geom from horseback.
#Halberd - [[Woldo]] (Hangul: 월도, Hanja: 月刀) A weapon, literally "moon knife", which is often compared to a European halberd although it more closely resembles a [[glaive]] with a large head.
#[[Halberd]] on horseback - Masang woldo (Hangul: 마상월도, Hanja: 馬上月刀) This chapter describes how to use the wol do while mounted.
#Short halberd - [[Hyeopdo]] (Hangul: 협도, Hanja: 挾刀) Shorter version of the wol do.
#Shield - [[Deungpae]] (Hangul: 등패, Hanja: 藤牌) The use of a shield with a throw sword or throwspear. This chapter counts for two separate methods.

===Volume 4===
#Unarmed fighting - [[Gwonbeop]] (Hangul: 권법, Hanja: 拳法) This chapter is approximately 20 pages long with no discernible form patterns. 
#Stick - Gon bong (Hangul: 곤봉, Hanja: 棍棒) This chapter describes how to use the long stick in battle. Staff techniques entail strike, stab, block, parry etc. These techniques are fundamentals of all weapon techniques. After mastering staff skills, the study of other pole arms such as spear, sword, trident, moon sword etc. is accessible.
#Flail - [[Pyeongon]] (Hangul: 편곤, Hanja: 鞭棍) This weapon is made out of a long and short stick connected with a piece of rope or chain. Instead of a steel ball of spikes, the short stick acted as a flail, overfitted with a steel skin that had many painful protrusions.
#Flail on horseback - Masang pyeon gon (Hangul: 마상편곤, Hanja: 馬上鞭棍) This chapter described how to use the flail while riding a horse.
#Korean polo - Gyeok gu (Hangul: 격구, Hanja: 擊毬)  A game that resembles [[polo]]. Used to upgrade the riding skills of the cavalry, this sport was uniquely played by the [[Goguryeo]] cavalry as early as 400AD. The ball must be scored in a goal, but players must ride, hang or be in whatever position on a horse without touching the ground. Players may only touch the ball with a stick with a tightly bent loop on one end. They can balance the ball on the loop while riding, or throw it.
#Equestarian skills - Masang jae (Hangul: 마상재, Hanja: 馬上才) Six equestarian skills that the cavalry should master. This includes standing upside down on the horse, repetitively jumping from one side of the horse to the other, riding under the horse, riding two horses simultaneously, etc.

==Sources==
Earlier sources can be traced to Chinese General [[Qi Jiguang]]'s treatise on troops training, the [[Ji Xiao Xin Shu]] (Hangul: 기효신서, Hanja: 紀效新書, "New Books of Effective Methods"). [[Ji Xiao Xin Shu]] was written in 1561. The authors considered that although this type of training had little value for large-scale battle, it was nevertheless useful to train bodily flexibility, reflexes, hands speed, quick yet solid footwork and jumping capacity, all of which were very valuable for a warrior.

==Improvements==
As a manual, the Muyedobotongji made several improvements over its Chinese sources since many practical comments on training and the value of the described techniques were added, and shows the influence of the neighboring Chinese martial traditions on the Korean peninsula.

The book divides the techniques into stabbing, cutting and striking techniques, while earlier books divided them into long and short weapon skills. The old classification method had to be abandoned with the development of firearms. The long spear had lost its function as a long-range weapon by the time the book was written.&lt;ref&gt;Ehwa University Press 2008, Sippalgi: Traditional Korean Martial Arts, Dr. B.K. Choi&lt;/ref&gt; Quite clearly, first bow and arrow, and later the advent of firearms, rendered the long spear obsolete in this role.

'''Nautilus Productions LLC''' is an American video production, [[stock footage]], and photography company incorporated in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]] in 1997. The principals are producer/director Rick Allen and photographer Cindy Burnham. Nautilus specializes in documentary production and [[underwater videography]], and produced ''QAR DiveLive'', a live [[webcast]] of [[underwater archaeology]] filmed at the wreck of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' in 2000 and 2001.

==History and output==

Nautilus has produced several documentaries, including ''The Kill Zone'' for the National Geographic International Channel; ''Assault on America: The Battle for Torpedo Junction'' for the Canadian History Channel; and the ''Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck'' for [[Texas A&amp;M University]]; [[BOEM]]; and the [[Louisiana State Museum]].&lt;ref name="uwf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tamu"/&gt; Above the water Nautilus spent seven years covering [[NASCAR]] for [[Office Depot]] and also worked with [[Bob Ballard]], discoverer of the ''[[Titanic]]'', on a piece for CBS [[60 Minutes]].&lt;ref name="quadangles"/&gt;

Nautilus Productions is also the owner and licensor of stock footage from the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' Shipwreck Project.&lt;ref name="qar partners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="qar facts"/&gt; Many documentaries created about the pirate [[Blackbeard]] and the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' Shipwreck Project have incorporated project videographer Rick Allen's stock footage or video in their content.&lt;ref name="p3"/&gt;

In 2000, Nautilus Productions co-produced with Bill Lovin of Marine Grafics, a week-long live internet broadcast known as ''QAR DiveLive'' from the Blackbeard wreck site and the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' conservation lab.&lt;ref name="Eslinger 2002"/&gt; At the time, this was the first live video and audio broadcast from an underwater archaeological site to the [[World Wide Web]]. Students were able to watch the underwater archaeology in real time, virtually visit the lab and ask questions of the scientists exploring the [[shipwreck]].&lt;ref name="wral"/&gt; The twice-daily live distance learning programs reached students from as far away as Canada during the five days of broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Eslinger 2002" /&gt; In October 2001 Allen and Lovin again co-produced the ''QAR DiveLive'' 2001 webcasts with similar success.&lt;ref name="macworld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="qar divelive" /&gt;

Other projects include videography on the ''[[USS Monitor]]'' and ''[[HMCS Canada]]'' (''[[Queen of Nassau]]'') with the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] ([[NOAA]]),&lt;ref name="monitor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="queen of nassau"/&gt; the recovery of a [[World War II]] era [[B-25C Mitchell]] bomber from [[Lake Murray (South Carolina)|Lake Murray]], SC for the [[Mega Movers]] series on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]],&lt;ref name="air and space"/&gt; and the ''[[SS Commodore]]'', made famous in author [[Stephen Crane]]'s short story "[[The Open Boat]]".&lt;ref name="commodore"/&gt;

[[File:Volumes of the 'The Dictionary of Art' shelved.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''The Dictionary of Art''&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''''Oxford Art Online''''' (formerly known as '''''Grove Art Online''''', previous to that '''''The Dictionary of Art''''' and often referred to as '''''The Grove Dictionary of Art''''') is a large [[encyclopedia]] of [[art]], now part of the online reference publications of [[Oxford University Press]], and previously a 34-volume printed encyclopedia first published by Grove in [[1996 in art|1996]] and reprinted with minor corrections in 1998. A new edition was published in 2003 by Oxford University Press.

==Scope==
Written by 6,700 experts from around the world, its 32,600-pages cover over 45,000 topics about art, artists, [[art critic]]s, [[art collector]]s, or anything else connected to the world of art. According to ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' it is the "most ambitious art-publishing venture of the late 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;Kimmelman, Michael (24 August 1997). [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/24/reviews/970824.24kimmelt.html?_r=1 "Michelangelo Meets Buffalo Meat"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half the content covers non-Western subjects, and contributors hail from 120 countries. Topics range from [[Julia Margaret Cameron]] to [[Shoji Hamada]], [[Korea]] to [[Timbuktu]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] to [[Marxism]], and [[Yoruba people#Culture|Yoruba masks]] to [[Abstract Expressionism]]. Entries include bibliographies and a vast number of images.

==Print editions==
The dictionary is still available in a standard hardcover edition, though the leather-bound version appears to be out of print.

Various smaller specialized redactions have been published, such as ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts'', (Editor, Gordon Campbell, OUP 2006,  {{ISBN|0195189485}}),''The Grove Dictionary of Materials and Techniques in Art'' (OUP 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-19-531391-8}}), ''From David to Ingres: Early 19th-Century French Artists (Grove Dictionary of Art)'' and so on.  

The ''Grove Dictionary of Art'' is published by [[Oxford University Press]], who acquired it from [[Macmillan Publishers]] in 2003.

==Online edition==
The online version, which is updated three times a year, is available by subscription and includes some extra content. In the UK, many public libraries offer it free to their online users using their library membership number and a PIN to log in. ''The Grove Dictionary of Art'' was first offered online through the ''Grove Art Online'' web site in 1998.&lt;!--dead link&lt;ref&gt;"Grove Art Online Reviews" &lt;http://www.groveart.com/grove-owned/art/reviews.html&gt; [Retrieved January 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The site was expanded and renamed as '''''Oxford Art Online''''', including other works: ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art'', ''Encyclopedia of Aesthetics'', ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms''. In 2011, the ''[[Benezit Dictionary of Artists]]'' was added to the database.

'''Juan Kachmanian''' (born April 6, 1930) is an Argentinean/American [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known by his [[ring name]], '''Pampero Firpo'''.

== Professional wrestling career ==
Having been trained by Rudy Dusek, he made his debut in 1953 and wrestled variously as Ervan the Armenian, Ivan the Terrible, The Missing Link, The Great Pampero and the Wild Bull of the Pampas, as well as his most famous alter-ego of Pampero Firpo (named after the original, [[Luis Ángel Firpo]]).&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; An early pioneer of [[hardcore wrestling]], Kachmanian usually wrestled as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], although he would go on to have a run as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] after being [[Professional wrestling attacks#Fireball|fireballed]] by [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]].&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; Other notable feuds in his career would include [[Nick Bockwinkel]], [[Alberto Madril]] and Apollo Jalisco.&lt;ref name=oww/&gt;

Amongst the titles he held in his career were the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Texas version)]], the [[NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Detroit version)]], the [[NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship]] and the [[NWA Hawaii Heavyweight Championship]],&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; as well as being the inaugural holder of the [[NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ca/la/hw/ams-h.html N.W.A. Americas Heavyweight Title]&lt;/ref&gt; Using the [[bear hug]] and the [[Professional wrestling holds#Clawhold|El Garfio]] as his signature moves, Kachmanian popularized the drawn-out catchphrase 'ohhh yeah!' which would later become associated with [[Randy Savage]].&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; He retired in 1986 and then worked for the [[United States Postal Service]] in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref name=oww&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrestler Profiles: Pampero Firpo|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/p/pampero-firpo.html|accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Queer Review - 07 - 2011-06-19 - All things Trans (an introduction) on Queer Review.vorb.oga|thumb|right|Continued discussion on Pride Library.]]

The '''Pride Library''' is a collection of books, periodicals, and audio-visual resources by and about gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transsexuals, and other [[queer]] folk. Located in the D.B. Weldon Library at The [[University of Western Ontario]], the Pride Library is the first official queer resource center at a Canadian university.  Since its founding in the Faculty of Arts in the late 1990s, The Pride Library has grown rapidly with the support of donors, volunteers, faculty, and administrators at The University of Western Ontario.

The Pride Library collection consists of over 6000 catalogued items: scholarly books; popular novels; videocassettes and DVDs of queer documentaries and feature films; slides of paintings and posters by queer artists; academic periodicals; and community magazines.  Over 15 languages are represented in the collection.  Subjects include the Gay Liberation Movement, gay and lesbian literary history, coming out, women's health and safety, homophobia, bisexuality, trans life, pornography, censorship, and same-sex marriage.  Also included in the collection are early sexology works, homophobic classics, and [[Gay pulp fiction|queer pulps]] from the 1950s and 1960s.

Special collections include the Hudler Archives and the Burroughs Collection.  The Hudler Archives is named after Richard Hudler, a local activist who served as president of the Homophile Association of London Ontario (HALO) from 1981 to 1995.  The archives include the HALO community records, Hudler's personal papers, literary manuscripts, newspaper clippings, legal files, photographs documenting queer social history in London, and the catalogues of the [[Visual AIDS]] poster exhibition from 1988 through 1995.  Exhibits of archival materials (Body Politic covers, HALO files, and Visual AIDS posters) can be viewed online at the library website.  The William S. Burroughs Collection—[[William S. Burroughs|Burroughs]], celebrated for being both subversive and surreal, is the author of ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' (1959) and [[Queer (novel)|''Queer'']] (1985)—includes fictional works as well as autobiographies, essays, and interviews.

The Pride Library was founded by Professor James Miller in his office in the Tower of University College in 1997.   In the summer of 2005 it was relocated on the main floor of the Weldon Library at the heart of the campus and officially reopened on February 14, 2006.  Every aspect of the library was carefully designed and chosen to reflect its unique mandate and to welcome visitors into a distinctively queer space.

*The walls are painted ‘Orchid Bouquet,’ a queer shade of The University of Western Ontario's official purple
*Artistic depictions of historic figures ([[Virginia Woolf]], [[Oscar Wilde]]) highlight the importance of queer contributions to cultural history
*A giant Q serving as a window frame was originally a table-top on the set of the first queer television show in Ontario, ''The Q Files'', hosted by the out lesbian broadcastor and author [[Irshad Manji]]
*The [[Pride Library stained glass window]] in the entrance displays the Pride Library logo (a set of vertically standing books, each in a different colour of the rainbow) supported by the HALO logo in the form of a bookend. London artist Lynette Richards designed and constructed the window

Much of the Library's success is due to generous support from volunteers and donors. Volunteers offer reference services to visitors and assist in maintaining and organizing the collection. Businesses, organizations, and individuals have all helped the collection grow through donations. Notable donors include:

*[[Glad Day Bookshop]] (Toronto)
*Canadian Lesbian Fiction Addicts, an online community of fiction readers, writers, and publishers
*Martin Padgett and Ken Heard, who donated queer materials from their 90 shelf metres of books 
*Nairne Holtz, a fiction writer and creator of an annotated bibliography of Canadian literature with lesbian content
*The University Students’ Council of The University of Western Ontario
*Mike Niederman, local collector of works by William S. Burroughs

The University of Western Ontario has been supportive in a variety of ways. A donation of $50,000 from the university administration in the spring of 2006 covered the renovation of the new space and the conversion of the catalogued books into a circulating collection.  The University has also donated the space where the library is located, and included Pride materials in its online public access catalogue. In this way, resources are made accessible to students and non-students alike.

== Stained Glass ==
The front of the [[The D. B. Weldon Library|D.B. Weldon Library]]'s Pride Library at the [[University of Western Ontario]] is decorated with a beautiful stained-glass window.  The window, designed and constructed by [[London, Ontario]] artist [[Lynette Richards]], consists of the Pride Library logo amid a list of some of history's most influential homo-, bi-, and trans-sexual authors.  The Pride Library logo contains a series of shelved books, coloured with the spectrum of the rainbow, supported by the logo of the now disbanded [[Homophile Association of London Ontario|HALO]] ([[Homophile Association of London Ontario]]), which has made significant contributions to the Pride Library.

The '''Pro Football Hall of Fame Game''' is an annual [[National Football League]] (NFL) [[exhibition game]] that is held the weekend of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]'s induction ceremonies. The game is played at [[Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium]], which is located adjacent to the Hall of Fame building in [[Canton, Ohio]]. It is traditionally the first game played in the [[National Football League preseason|NFL preseason]] for any given year, marking the end of the NFL's six-month off-season.

==Team selection==
The two teams that play in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game are typically selected by the league in advance of the remainder of the preseason schedule. The participants are usually announced around the time that the new [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] members are announced, which coincides with [[Super Bowl]] week. Often, if a particularly notable player will be entering the Hall of Fame that year, a team they were strongly associated with may be selected to play in the game to help maximize attendance and publicity of the game itself. From 1971 to 2010, the opponents for each game usually included one [[American Football Conference|AFC]] team and one [[National Football Conference|NFC]] team. In 2009, as recognition of the 50th anniversary of the [[American Football League]], the game paired two AFC teams who were part of the "original eight" franchises of the AFL, the [[Tennessee Titans]] (dressed as their previous incarnation, the [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]]) and the [[Buffalo Bills]], whose owner, [[Ralph Wilson]], was inducted into the Hall that year. An all-NFC matchup was scheduled for 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/enshrinement/2012/2/29/cardinals-vs-saints-in-2012-hall-of-fame-game/ |title=Individual Tickets &amp; Festival Fan Packages |publisher=Profootballhof.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910140505/http://www.profootballhof.com/enshrinement/2012/2/29/cardinals-vs-saints-in-2012-hall-of-fame-game/ |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was canceled due to the [[2011 NFL lockout]]; the following year, another intra-conference matchup of two NFC teams took its place. From 2011 onward, each team selected to play in the game has had at least one prominent alumnus being inducted into the Hall that year.

Because this game and the Hall of Fame's induction ceremonies are scheduled on the weekend before the league's regular four-week exhibition season begins, both teams end up playing five exhibition games instead of the normal four, and unlike the [[Canadian Football League]] (which plays its two-game exhibition season over three weeks), the league does not remove antone. 
The last four [[expansion team]]s to have been added to the league each played in the Hall of Fame Game as their first game. In [[1995 NFL season|1995]], expansion clubs [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] and [[Carolina Panthers|Carolina]] played each another, and in [[2002 NFL season|2002]], [[Houston Texans|Houston]] was one of the participants. When the [[Cleveland Browns]] [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|returned to the league]] with a [[1999 NFL Expansion Draft|rebooted roster]] in [[1999 NFL season|1999]], they too played in the Hall of Fame Game. The Baltimore Ravens, while officially considered as being established in [[1996 NFL season|1996]], did not play in the Hall of Fame Game until [[2018 NFL season|2018]]. With the Ravens' participation in the 2018 game, all 32 current NFL teams have now played in the Hall of Fame game at least once.

===Scheduling===
Prior to the [[AFL–NFL merger]], the Hall of Fame Game was played in August or September, in some cases at the end of the preseason. In 1970, it was moved to the beginning of the preseason. Prior to 2002, it was not uncommon for the game to be played in July. Since 2002, when the league permanently moved the start of the season to the weekend after [[Labor Day]], the game has always been played in early August.

The [[2011 NFL season|2011]] game was originally scheduled between the [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St. Louis Rams]] and the [[Chicago Bears]], but the game was canceled due to an ongoing [[2011 NFL lockout|labor dispute]] that had disrupted nearly all league activity during the 2011 offseason. The two clubs had set a deadline of July 22 to ratify a resolution in enough time to prepare for the game. The league and players did not ratify the agreement until July 25, forcing cancellation of the game.

The [[2016 NFL season|2016]] edition, which was scheduled to be played between the [[2016 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] and the [[2016 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]], was [[Cancelled NFL games#2016 Hall of Fame Game|canceled]] due to unsafe playing conditions. Mike Silver of [[NFL.com]] reported that on the morning of game day, the logos at midfield and the end zones had been painted using paint which was not intended for use on artificial turf. When it was apparent the paint wasn't drying fast enough, the field was heated to speed up the drying process, but this caused the turf's rubber to melt. These issues led to unfavorable play conditions. The affected areas were described as being slick and "like cement," making it impossible to get decent footing. Stadium officials attempted to address this by applying a solvent, reportedly [[paint thinner]], to the turf. A Packers employee noticed a label warning that this substance could result in burns when exposed to skin, and alerted others to the discovery. When officially cancelling the game, both the league and the [[National Football League Players Association|Players Association]] cited safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000681512/article/hof-game-cancellation-was-right-thing-to-do|title=Hall of Fame Game cancellation: NFL made the right decision|last=Silver|first=Mike|publisher=NFL.com|date=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poor field conditions force cancellation of Hall of Fame game|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17241245/hall-fame-game-canceled-due-poor-field-conditions-tom-benson-stadium|last=Demovsky|first=Rob|work=ESPN.com|date=August 7, 2016|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sbnation-hof2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame Game fiasco: How the wrong paint, melted rubber, and caustic paint thinner nixed Packers-Colts|url=http://www.acmepackingcompany.com/2016/8/9/12405268/hall-of-fame-game-fiasco-paint-field-melted-rubber-paint-thinner-packers-colts|website=Acme Packing Company (SBNation)|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams were told at 6:40 p.m.—an hour and 20 minutes before kickoff—that the game was going to be canceled. However, fans in the stadium only learned of the pending cancellation via social media. No official announcement was made until just before the scheduled 8 p.m. kickoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/columnists/gregg-doyel/2016/08/07/doyel-nfl-fans-deserve-better/88380724/|title=Doyel: NFL fans deserve better|last=Doyel|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Doyel|publisher=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28, 2016, the NFL announced that the [[2017 NFL season|2017]] edition of the game would be played on a Thursday (August 3). This scheduling change made the Hall of Fame Game the first event of the Hall of Fame Weekend. The [[2018 NFL season|2018]] game was also played on a Thursday (August 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hofexperiences.com/enshrinement-ticket-packages/hall-of-fame-package-comparison |title=Pro Football Hall of Fame Experiences |website=hofexperiences.com |accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Come 2019, the game will be played on August 1.

==Television and radio==
Unlike the majority of NFL preseason games, which air on local TV stations, the Hall of Fame Game airs nationwide. From [[1999 NFL season|1999]] to [[2005 NFL season|2005]], the game was held on Monday night, televised as part of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' package. It had previously been held typically on Saturday afternoons, except from 1963 to 1965 on Sunday afternoons, televised as part of ABC's ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' package (still using the ''MNF'' crew). In 1998, the game was put in the ''MNF'' package, and played on a Saturday night, which served as a test run for the move to Monday night. Starting in [[2006 NFL season|2006]], it was moved to Sunday night, coinciding with the new ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_8|title="Sunday Night Football" Debuts|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; television package. 

The 2007 game was telecast on [[Thursday Night Football|NFL Network]], as NBC was intending to televise the [[China Bowl (NFL)|China Bowl]] game in [[Beijing, China]] (a game which was postponed to 2009 and later canceled). The Hall of Fame Game has since bounced between both networks. The 2012 game aired on NFL Network due to NBC's coverage of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]]. After a two-year absence, the game returned to NBC in 2013 and remained on the network until 2015. The 2016 game was scheduled to air on [[Monday Night Football|ESPN]] due to NBC's coverage of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], but the game was canceled due to field conditions. It returned to NBC in 2017 and will remain on the network until 2019.

[[NFL on Westwood One Sports|Westwood One]] owns national radio rights; it is the only preseason game to air on a nationwide network. Each team's radio network is also allowed to broadcast the games (albeit usually with fewer affiliates since exhibition games are traditionally much lower priority to non-sports and non-flagship stations).

In 2007 and 2008, the game was broadcast live in both Ireland and the United Kingdom by [[Sky Sports]]. It was not shown in 2009 because of a dispute between [[Sky Sports]] and the NFL over TV rights. [[ESPN America]] (formerly North American Sports Network) broadcasts the game in the rest of Europe.

From 1998 to 2005, the [[Global Television Network]] aired the game in [[Canada]], simulcasting ABC; upon the move to Sunday night in [[2006 NFL season|2006]], the [[CTV Television Network]] aired the game until [[2010 NFL season|2010]]. With CTV airing the 2012 Summer Olympics, [[The Sports Network|TSN]] broadcast the Hall of Fame Game in 2012. [[Azteca 7]] aired Spanish-language coverage of the Hall of Fame Game in [[Mexico]] from 1998 to 2005; the Game moved to [[Canal 5 (Televisa Network)|Canal 5]] in 2006 and aired on that station until 2010. Due to the cancellation of the 2011 Hall of Fame Game and [[Televisa]]'s Summer Olympics coverage, the Hall of Fame Game moved to [[Televisa Deportes]] in 2012 and then to [[Galavision (Mexico)|Galavision]] in 2013.

Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium is part of the Cleveland market, and is also within 75 miles of numerous other television markets in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania. As such, the NBC affiliates (and before them, the ABC affiliates) were within league requirements to [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] the game in the rare event the game does not sell out, during the time the league had a [[National Football League television blackout policies|blackout policy]] (the policy has been suspended indefinitely since 2015). Because the stadium only holds 22,375 fans (less than half the capacity of any other NFL stadium except the [[StubHub Center]], which is the temporary home of the Los Angeles Chargers while their permanent stadium [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park]] is built) and the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies bring large numbers of outside fans to Canton, the game has, to date, always sold out; several NFL teams, as well as the Super Bowl, have similarly enjoyed long sellout streaks.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Pdm cover.jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''''Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual''''' ('''PDM''') is a diagnostic handbook similar to the [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD) or the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM). The PDM was published on May 28, 2006.

The information contained in the PDM was collected by a collaborative task force which includes members of the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]], the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]], the Division of Psychoanalysis (Division 39) of the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry]], and the National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work.

Although it is based on current neuroscience and treatment outcome studies, Carey (2006) points out that many of the concepts in the PDM are adapted from the classical [[psychoanalytic]] tradition of psychotherapy. For example, the PDM indicates that the [[anxiety disorders]] may be traced to the "four basic danger situations" described by [[Sigmund Freud]] (1926)&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;{{cite book|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|title=The Collected Works of Sigmund Freud|year=1926|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=Vol 20|edition=Standard|chapter=Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as the loss of a significant other; the loss of love; the loss of body integrity; and the loss of affirmation by one's own conscience.&lt;ref name=Carey&gt;{{cite news|last=Carey|first=Benedict|title=For Therapy, a New Guide With a Touch of Personality|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a new perspective on the existing diagnostic system as it enables clinicians to describe and categorize personality patterns, related social and emotional capacities, unique mental profiles, and personal experiences of the patient.&lt;ref name=Etnyre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etnyre|first=W|title=Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual|journal=Journal of Clinical Social Work|year=2008|volume=36|pages=403–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PDM is not intended to compete with the DSM or ICD. The authors report the work emphasizes "individual variations as well as commonalities" by "focusing on the full range of mental functioning" and serves as a "[complement to] the DSM and ICD efforts in cataloguing [sic] symptoms.&lt;ref name="HomePage"&gt;{{cite web|last=PDM Task Force|title=Home Page|url=http://www.pdm1.org/index.htm|publisher=Alliance of Psychoanalytic Organizations|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The task force intends for the PDM to augment the existing diagnostic taxonomies by providing "a multi dimensional approach to describe the intricacies of the patient's overall functioning and ways of engaging in the therapeutic process.".&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite web|last=PDM Task Force|title=Introduction|url=http://www.pdm1.org/intro.htm|publisher=Alliance of Psychoanalytic Organizations|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy ==

=== Dimension I: Personality Patterns and Disorders ===

This first dimension classifies personality patterns in two domains.  First, it looks at the spectrum of personality types and places the person's personality on a continuum from unhealthy and maladaptive to healthy and adaptive. Second, it classifies the how the person "organizes mental functioning and engages the world".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;

The task force adds, "This dimension has been placed first in the PDM system because of the accumulating evidence that symptoms or problems cannot be understood, assessed, or treated in the absence of an understanding of the mental life of the person who has the symptoms".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  In other words, a list of symptoms characteristic of a diagnosis does not adequately inform a clinician how to understand and treat the symptoms without proper context.  By analogy, if a patient went to her physician complaining of watering eyes and a runny nose, the symptoms alone do not indicate the appropriate treatment.  Her symptoms could be a function of seasonal allergies, a bacterial sinus infection, the common cold, or she may have just come from her grandmother's funeral.  The doctor might treat allergies with an antihisamine, the sinus infection with antibiotics, the cold with zinc, and give her patient a Kleenex tissue after the funeral.  All four conditions may have very similar symptoms; all four condition are treated very differently.

=== Dimension II: Mental Functioning ===
Next, the PDM provides a "detailed description of emotional functioning" which are understood to be "the capacities that contribute to an individual's personality and overall level of psychological health or pathology".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  This dimension provides a "microscopic" examination of the patient's mental life by systematically accounting for their functional capacity to
* Process information
* Self-regulate
* Establish and maintain relationships
* Experience, organize, and express feelings and emotions at different levels
* Represent, differentiate, and integrate experience
* Utilize appropriate coping strategies and defense mechanisms
* Accurately observe oneself and others
* Form internal values and standards

=== Dimension III: Manifest Symptoms and Concerns ===

The third dimension starts with the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic categories; moreover, beyond simply listing symptoms, the PDM "goes on to describe the affective states, cognitive processes, somatic experiences, and relational patterns most often associated clinically" with each diagnosis.&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  In this dimension, "symptom clusters" are "useful descriptors" which presents the patient's "symptom patterns in terms of the patient's personal experience of his or her prevailing difficulties".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  The task force concludes, "The patient may evidence a few or many patterns, which may or may not be related, and which should be seen in the context of the person's personality and mental functioning.  The multi dimensional approach... provides a systematic way to describe patients that is faithful to their complexity and helpful in planning appropriate treatments".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;

== The new edition (PDM-2) ==
Guilford Press will be publishing a new edition of the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM-2), which is being developed by a steering committee composed by [[Vittorio Lingiardi]] (Editor), [[Nancy McWilliams]] (Editor), and [[Robert S. Wallerstein]] (Honorary Chair). Guilford Press received a manuscript for PDM-2 in September 2016, and the current release date is set for June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Guilford Press Customer Service&lt;/ref&gt;

The Motor Vessel '''''Zephyr''''' is currently owned by Ron Micjan and Ashley Paterson and is operated under the mantle of Outbound Marine LLC.  The ''Zephyr'' was purchased from Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in October 2013 and was moved to Portland Oregon and refurbished over the next 2.5 years into a custom cruising, small ship expedition vessel and is still ready for research work as well.

Prior ownership of ''Zephyr'' was as  a [[research vessel]] operated by the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] (MBARI). It was the primary platform of operations for MBARI's [[AUV]] program and it was then christened R/V ''Zephyr''.

The original owner of the vessel was the San Francisco Bar Pilots who had her built to specification by the Colberg boat works in Stockton. http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/5small/inactive/colberg.htm

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3995">[[Image:First Mexican Empire (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Territory of Northern America declared independent. (Northern border from later [[Adams–Onís Treaty]].)]]

The '''Solemn Act of Northern America's Declaration of Independence''' ({{lang-es|Acta Solemne de la Declaración de Independencia de la América Septentrional}}) is the first [[Mexico|Mexican]] legal historical document which established the separation of Mexico from [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish rule]].  It was signed on November 6, 1813, by the deputies of the [[Congress of Chilpancingo|Congress of Anáhuac]], organized by General [[José María Morelos]] in the city of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] in June of that same year, and later installed in the city of [[Chilpancingo]] on September 13.

The document gathers some of the main political uprisings contained in "[[Feelings of the Nation]]" (''Sentimientos de la Nación''), a document of the speech Morelos gave to the representatives of the free provinces of southern New Spain  on September 14.

This document indicated that given the circumstances in Europe – the [[Peninsular War|occupation of Spain by the Napoleonic army]] –  [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] had recovered its sovereignty from the [[Crown of Castile]] in 1808, when Ferdinand had been deposed, and therefore, any union between the overseas colonies and the Peninsula had been dissolved. This was a legal concept that was also invoked by the other [[Spanish American wars of independence|declarations of independence in Spanish America]], such as [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|Venezuela]] (1811) and [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|Argentina]] (1816), which were responding to the same events. 

The resulting state would be a successor to the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] and it would preserve all of its territory in [[North America]] (''América Septentrional''). The Solemn Act defined penalties for those people who contravene the insurgent war or for those who refused to give their financial support. The Act also recognized the [[Roman Catholic]] religion as the sole, official religion of the nation.

It was signed by:
*[[Andrés Quintana Roo]]
*[[Ignacio López Rayón]]
*[[Carlos María Bustamante]]
*[[José Manuel de Herrera]]
*[[José Sixto Verduzco]]
*[[José María Liceaga]]
*[[Cornelio Ortiz de Zárate]]

'''''Stoddard v. Martin''''' [[Case citation|1 R.I. 1 (1828)]] was the first case recorded in the official [[Law reporter|reports]] of the [[Rhode Island Supreme Court]].

==Holding==
In the Court's first officially recorded decision, Chief Justice [[Samuel Eddy]] held that a [[Gambling|bet]] on the outcome of the 1826 U.S. Senate election ([[Ashur Robbins]] won) was a [[Void (law)|void]] contract as against [[public policy]] because of its immorality.&lt;ref&gt;''Stoddard v. Martin'', 1 R.I. 1 (1828)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Justice Eddy cited British [[common law]] [[precedent]] to support the decision. Cited cases include: ''Gilbert and Sykes'', (16 East. 156); ''Vescher v. Yates'' (11 Johns. 31); ''[[Da Costa v. Jones]]'' (Cowp. 720); ''Bunn v. Riker'' (4 Johns. 428); ''Lansing v. Lansing'' (8 Johns. 454).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5881">The '''Swedish library classification system''', ({{lang-sv|Klassifikationssystem för svenska bibliotek}}), or '''SAB system''' (''SAB-systemet'') is a library classification system for use in many [[public library|public]], [[school library|school]], and [[research library|research]] [[library|libraries]] in [[Sweden]]. It primarily classifies books but is also used for other media, such as audio and video recordings. The first edition of the system was released in 1921 and was based on the classification that was used in the accession catalogs of the scientific libraries of that time. The abbreviation 'SAB' is for "Sveriges Allmänna Biblioteksförening" (''Sweden's public library association''). SAB merged with Svenska bibliotekariesamfundet (''Swedish librarians' association'') to form present day [[Svensk Biblioteksförening]] (''Swedish library association'').

The SAB system is regularly revised to track developments in new subject areas. The committee for classification systems for Swedish libraries &amp;mdash; a part of Svensk Biblioteksförening &amp;mdash; promulgates changes, corrections, and usage notes. Larger revisions may cause changes to the whole system and a new version of the classification system is published. The latest, eighth revision was started in 2002 and was put in use in autumn 2006.


Both the research libraries &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Dewey nästa
|author=Kungl. Biblioteket
|date=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (via the [[National Library of Sweden]]) and the public libraries &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url    = http://www.biblioteksforeningen.se/nyheter/g/nyhet03850.html
 |title  = Svensk Biblioteksförening förordar Dewey
 |date   = January 11, 2009
 |author = Svensk biblioteksförening
}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; decided at the end of 2008 to recommend a transition to the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal system]]. The research libraries' major reason for transitioning are simplification: large parts of research literature is already classified in this system. For public libraries the concern is to have the same classification system over the entire country. A considerable savings would be enjoyed by both parties by not having to maintain a distinct national classification system.

==Structure==
SAB is built in a [[tree structure]], where each individual subject has a ''signum''. A signum is a code of one or more letters and sometimes other symbols, which together represent a particular subject category. The first letter, in upper case, indicates a general subject area (e.g. '''C'''  for ''[[religion]]''). Additional lower case letters after the initial letter indicate more specialized subjects (e.g. '''Cg''' for ''[[theology|practical theology]]'' and '''Cge''' for [[cathechethics]]. There is in principle no limit to how many subcategories can be formed in this way.

==Additional notation==
A signum can be made more precise with additional notation. The following additional notations exist:
* Geographic division (expressed with a hyphen)
: '''Ab''' ''Libraries'', '''Ab-c''' ''Libraries : Sweden'' or '''Qaea-j''' ''Monetary systems : France''.
* Chronological division (expressed with a period)
: '''Kc.3''' ''Swedish history : Middle ages''.
* Language specification (expressed with an equal sign)
: '''Kj=e''' ''History of France: in English'' 
* Aspect (expressed with a colon)
: '''F:do''' ''Language : psychology'' or '''Pcj:k''' ''Telephony : history''
* Biography (expressed with 'z' and the name of the subject of the biography)
: '''Dcz Chomsky, Noam''' ''Logic and language-oriented philosophy : biographies of Noam Chomsky''
* Type of work (expressed with parentheses)
: '''Ke(u)''' ''English history : [[primary source]]'' or '''Vpg(p)''' ''[[Nursing]] : periodical''
* Target audience (expressed with a comma or as a prefix to the signature stem)
: '''Ih,u''' or '''uIh''' ''Arts and crafts : for children or young adults'' 
* Medium (expressed with a solidus)
: '''Cba/LG''' ''Old testament : recording, gramophone record'' 

In addition special additional codes are available which are only used on particular signums. These always begin with '''.0'''. For instance, the category '''Fc''' (''the Swedish language'') can be subdivided 
* '''Fc.00''' ''History of the Swedish language''
* '''Fc.01''' ''Swedish grammar'' 
* '''Fc.011''' ''Swedish phonetics''
* '''Fc.02''' ''Swedish vocabulary'' 
etc.

Additional notation may be combined. Thus, '''Ab-c:b(p)''' for ''Libraries : Sweden : research : periodicals''.

==SAB main classes==
The main classes of SAB are
* '''A''' - [[Book]]s and [[library|libraries]]
* '''B''' - General interest
* '''C''' - [[Religion]]
* '''D''' - [[Philosophy]] and [[psychology]]
* '''E''' - [[Parenting]] and [[education]]
* '''F''' - [[Philology]] and [[linguistics]]
* '''G''' - [[Literary science]]

* '''K''' - [[History]]
* '''L''' - [[Biography]] with [[genealogy]]
* '''M''' - [[Ethnography]], [[social anthropology]], and [[ethnology]]
* '''N''' - [[Geography]]
* '''O''' - [[Social science]] and [[jurisprudence]]
* '''P''' - [[Technology]], [[industry]], and [[communication]]
* '''Q''' - [[Economics]] and [[business]]

The '''''Transylvanian Memorandum''''' was a [[petition]] sent in 1892 by the leaders of the [[Romanians]] of [[Transylvania]] to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Emperor-King [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], asking for equal ethnic rights with the [[Magyars|Hungarians]], and demanding an end to persecutions and [[Magyarization]] attempts.

==Status==
After the ''[[Ausgleich]]'' of 1867, although Romanians formed the majority of Transylvania's population, they had not been awarded legal status as a nation.

The ''Memorandum'' itself was written by the leaders of the [[Romanian National Party|Romanian National Party of Transylvania and Banat]] (PNR) - among others, [[Ioan Rațiu]], [[Gheorghe Pop de Băsești]], [[Eugen Brote]], [[Aurel Popovici]], and [[Vasile Lucaciu]]. It asked for [[political rights]] to be awarded to Romanians, as well as initiating a debate on the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]'s policies of intolerance towards Romanians.

==Consequences==
Franz Joseph, without reading it, forwarded the memorandum to [[Budapest]] parliament, which, also without reading it, sent it back to the head of delegation. After printing and spreading the document, the authors were charged with incitement committed through the press, and most of them sentenced to prison terms from two months to five years. Although in 1895 they were freed by royal amnesty, loyalty to the Crown decreased, with many leaders of the PNR turning towards the goal of [[union of Transylvania with Romania]]. 

However, activism for union ''per se'' was largely held off until after [[World War I]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]], with Romania itself oscillating between alliances with the [[Central Powers]] and the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], and with the parallel offer made by [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] (the [[heir apparent]]) to negotiate for a compromise (''see [[United States of Greater Austria]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2252">The '''USENET Cookbook''' was an experiment in [[electronic publishing]] conducted by [[Brian Reid (computer scientist)|Brian Reid]] in 1985-1987, several years before the [[World Wide Web|Web]].  Reid distinguishes between electronic ''printing'' (the production of individual documents) and electronic ''[[publishing]]'' (the full process including dissemination).

The [[USENET]] [[cookbook]] was a collaboratively-produced cookbook.  Recipes were solicited from contributors worldwide.  They were heavily [[copy editing|edited]] for style and content and distributed by [[email]] weekly; later, they were distributed on the [[USENET]] [[newsgroup]] ''alt.gourmand''.  Recipes were distributed both as plain [[ASCII]] text, and [[markup language|marked up]] in [[troff]], a widely available system on [[Unix]] systems.  Much of Reid's effort was devoted to the [[workflow]] aspects of publication.

There were about 300 contributors and 13000 subscribers to its regular updates, and over 500 recipes collected. The recipes were shown copyrighted by the USENET Community Trust with the notice:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material is granted provided that the copies are not made or distributed for direct commercial advantage, the USENET copyright notice and the title of the newsgroup and its date appear, and notice is given that copying is by permission of the USENET Community Trust or the original contributor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The recipes continue to circulate widely today on the Web.

'''Vinopedia.hr''' is a [[Croatia]]n online [[wine]] [[encyclopedia]].

Vinopedia.hr was launched in 2008 by Ivan Sokolić (1930–2014&lt;ref name="NL 20121105"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://radio.hrt.hr/radio-rijeka/clanak/preminuo-enolog-ivan-sokolic/52842/&lt;/ref&gt;), one of the most prominent Croatian [[enology|enologists]] and wine writers. Its content is based on the ''Grand Lexicon of [[Viticulture]] and [[Vinification]]'' ({{lang-hr|Veliki vinogradarsko-vinarski leksikon}}), Sokolić's 580-page reference work published in 2006.&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gastronaut"/&gt;

{{As of|2012|11}}, Vinopedia had 2,232 articles,&lt;ref name="Statistika"/&gt; and had amassed a total of 2.355 million [[Hit (internet)|page views]].&lt;ref name="NL 20121105"/&gt; Translation of content to English, German and Italian is planned, followed by French and Russian.&lt;ref name="NL 20101205"/&gt;

'''WIN-Initiative'''&lt;ref&gt;WIN-Initiative "[http://www.win-initiative.com/ Source 1]" Accessed 10/18/10&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent [[stock photography]] company that licenses images based on global [[youth culture]]. Founded in 2007 by [[photographer]] [[Hans Neleman]],&lt;ref&gt;Hans Neleman Photography "[http://www.neleman.com Source 2]" Accessed 10/18/10&lt;/ref&gt; WIN, which stands for '''Worldwide Image Navigation''', licenses images from its community of photographers from around the world. Essentially functioning as a collective, WIN Scouts are located in 22 countries. These Scouts assist in finding and retaining new talent, as well as being the liaison with the WIN headquarters team in SoHo, [[New York City]].

==Overview==

Photographer and WIN founder [[Hans Neleman]] has stated that he began the company when he started acquiring imagery from photographers he would meet during his travels. To ensure a certain level of quality, and to empower young photographers, Neleman would often leave cameras, lighting equipment and other gear with his local Scouts, who would then serve to distribute and recollect the equipment.

WIN, a [[rights managed]] company, then licenses these images through its Website and its partnerships with stock photography companies like [[Getty Images]]&lt;ref&gt;Getty Images "[http://www.gettyimages.com/ Source 3]" Accessed 10/18/10&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbis Images "[http://www.corbisimages.com/ Source 4]"Accessed 10/18/10&lt;/ref&gt; WIN's library offers youth-culture centric images. The company's Website promotes its images as "authentic, provocative and inspiring" and the company has marketed itself as the "alternative stock photography" agency.

The company launched a quarterly, online magazine, ''WINk''&lt;ref&gt;WINk Magazine "[http://www.wink-mag.com Source 5]" Accessed 10/18/10&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009, of which there have been four issues: Debut, The Light Issue, Provocative and Collaboration.

'''İstanbul State Art and Sculpture Museum''' ({{lang-tr|İstanbul Devlet Resim ve Heykel Müzesi}}) is a museum in [[İstanbul]], [[Turkey]].

The museum is in [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] in [[Vişnezade]] neighborhood of İstanbul. The building, just like the rest of the palace, was built in 1856. It was the mansion of the crown prince. On 20 September 1937, upon the suggestion of [[Mustafa kemal Atatürk]], the founder of the Turkish Republic, it was converted into a museum. 

There are paintings, sculptures and [[moulage]] by the Turkish and foreign artists in the museum. Most of the paintings are oil paintings. Some of the artists, whose works are exhibited, are [[Pierre Bonnard]] (1867—1947), [[André Derain]] (1880–1954), [[Henri Matisse]] (1869–1954), [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973) and [[Maurice Utrillo]] (1883– 5 1955).

As of 2005, the number of exhibited items are as follows; 3,977 paintings, 672 sculptures, 80 [[calligraphy]] artwork (Arabic script typeface) and 107 ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturvarliklari.gov.tr/TR,44029/msgsu-istanbul-resim-heykel-muzesi.html Cultural assets page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
