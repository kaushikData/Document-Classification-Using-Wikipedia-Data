==Chess news in brief==
*The meteoric rise of [[Anatoly Karpov]] continues to hold the attention of the chess world, as he chalks up win after win in the latest [[World Chess Championship|world championship]] qualifying cycle. His Moscow based, Candidates' quarter-final match against [[Lev Polugaevsky]], is a one-sided affair and Karpov emerges the victor by 5½-2½. In the other candidates' quarter-final matches, [[Viktor Korchnoi]] beats [[Henrique Mecking]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]], [[Tigran Petrosian]] beats [[Lajos Portisch]] in [[Palma de Mallorca]], and [[Boris Spassky]] beats [[Robert Byrne (chess player)|Robert Byrne]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. In the semi-finals, Korchnoi defeats Petrosian by 3½-1½ in [[Odessa]], while Karpov is again utterly convincing, winning 7-4 against Spassky in [[Leningrad]]. The battle between Karpov and Korchnoi in the (Moscow) final proves to be a tense and difficult struggle, although the younger man ultimately triumphs 12½-11½, amidst a large number of draws. As the winning candidate, Karpov is scheduled to meet [[Bobby Fischer]] for a world championship decider in 1975 and for his efforts in 1974, is awarded his second successive Chess Oscar. Meanwhile, Fischer puts forward a plan to [[FIDE]] for the conditions of the title match. Running to 179 numbered paragraphs, each of his conditions are acceptable to all parties, except for two. The rejected conditions concern the match being of unlimited length (first to win 10 games, regardless of draws) and that the title stays with the holder in the event of the score reaching 9-9. Fischer insists he will not back down on these stipulations and threatens to resign his title if they are not accepted. He has until April 1975 to finally decide.
*[[Evgeny Vasiukov]] excels at [[Manila]], winning the tournament with 10½/14, ahead of Tigran Petrosian (9½/14) and [[Bent Larsen]] (9/14).
*[[Montilla-Moriles]] is won by [[Ivan Radulov]] with 5½/9. In joint second place are [[Lubomir Kavalek]] and [[Helmut Pfleger]] (both 5/9). Oddly, the winner is the lowest rated of the ten contestants and while there is a large percentage of draws, many of the games are exciting and worthy of such a strong competition.
*The 14th IBM tournament is held at [[Amsterdam]] and is a close run affair, with three grandmasters all sharing first place. [[Borislav Ivkov]], [[Vladimir Tukmakov]] and [[Vlastimil Jansa]] score an identical 10/15. As with the Manila and Montilla tournaments, the entrants are all titled players, making for one of the strongest events of the year.
*The [[Nice]] [[Chess Olympiad|Olympiad]] is held at the Palais des Expositions. Offering an enormous playing arena,  the venue should surpass those of recent years, but a lack of air-conditioning and poor lighting provokes some criticism from the participants. After managing only narrow wins at [[Siegen]] and [[Skopje]], the Soviets reassert their pre-eminence at Nice, winning convincingly with 46/60, to silver medalling Yugoslavia's 37½/60. Third place is shared between the USA and Bulgaria with 36½/60. Bulgaria's excellent showing can be partly explained by the incentives offered by their federation. A team medal of any kind would have earned each player a car, but they just miss the bronze on tie-break. Anatoly Karpov, Boris Spassky, Tigran Petrosian and [[Mikhail Tal]] take home individual gold medals for outstanding performances on their respective boards, while Viktor Korchnoi and [[Gennady Kuzmin]] must settle for bronze. Petrosian scores 12½/14 for an 89.3% performance, the best of the event. [[Michael Stean]] picks up the $1000 Turover Brilliancy Prize for 'best game of the Olympiad' against Walter Browne. [[Wolfgang Uhlmann]] coins the phrase "One is permitted to lose to Karpov with Black" after suffering defeat in their round 4 encounter.
*[[Tony Miles]] wins the 13th [[World Junior Chess Championship]], held in Manila, after narrowly missing out the previous year to [[Alexander Beliavsky]]. Miles' good form keeps him on track to becoming England's first grandmaster.
*The 42nd [[USSR Chess Championship]] is won jointly by Alexander Beliavsky and Mikhail Tal (both 9½/15), ahead of [[Rafael Vaganian]] and Lev Polugaevsky (both 9/15).
*The annual [[Las Palmas]] tournament results in a win for [[Ljubomir Ljubojević]], whose tally is 11/15. He is a full point clear of second placed pair Alexander Beliavsky and [[Fridrik Olafsson]], both having 10/15.
*There is a strong entry at [[Sochi]], where Lev Polugaevsky triumphs at the 7th Chigorin Memorial, with a total of 11/15. Runner-up is [[Alexei Suetin]] (9/15). Polugaevsky continues the winning form he displayed earlier at [[Solingen]], where he scored 10/14, taking the tie-break from Lubomir Kavalek (also 10/14) and finishing well ahead of Boris Spassky and [[Bojan Kurajica]] (tied third on 8½/14).
*[[Reykjavík]] is won by [[Vasily Smyslov]] with 12/14, ahead of [[Gyozo Forintos]] (11/14) and, tied in third place on 10½/14, [[Dragoljub Velimirovic]] and [[David Bronstein]].
*Mikhail Tal wins at [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in East Germany with 11½/15, ahead of [[Rainer Knaak]] (10½/15) and [[Jan Smejkal]] (10/15). He is also a winner at [[Lublin]] and [[Novi Sad]].
*[[Vladimir Liberzon]] is victorious in [[Venice]], taking first place with 9½/13, ahead of [[Vasily Smyslov]] (9/13) and [[Duncan Suttles]] (8½/13). A strong field includes rising stars [[Ulf Andersson]] and [[Jan Timman]], as well as former USSR Champion [[Vladimir Savon]].
*The [[Hastings International Chess Congress]] has another good turnout of overseas grandmasters. A four-way tie for first place occurs between [[László Szabó (chess player)|László Szabó]], Mikhail Tal, Jan Timman and Gennady Kuzmin (all 10/15).
*The 11th [[Capablanca Memorial]] Tournament is held in [[Camagüey]], Cuba. Ulf Andersson wins with 11½/15, from [[Eduard Gufeld]] (11/15). Third place is shared between Evgeny Vasiukov and Rainer Knaak on 10/15.
*The first [[Pan American Chess Championship|Pan-American Championship]] is held in [[Winnipeg]]. It is won by [[Walter Browne]] ahead of an otherwise weak field. Browne has an eventful and rewarding year, winning the [[U.S. Chess Championship|U.S. Championship]] in [[Chicago]] for the first of six times, scoring further victories at [[Wijk aan Zee]] and [[Lone Pine International|Lone Pine]], and narrowly losing out to [[Bent Larsen]] at the 2nd World Open in [[New York City]].
*[[Jonathan Mestel]] wins the first ever [[World Youth Chess Championship|World Cadet Championship]], held in [[Pont-Sainte-Maxence]] in France. This is to become a regular and important event in the junior chess calendar and is a forerunner to the World Youth Festivals that expand to cover many more age categories.
*Bulgaria's great effort and high placing at the Olympiad is followed by an intensely competitive [[Bulgarian Chess Championship|national championship]]. Held at [[Asenovgrad]], the result is a tie between [[Nikola Padevsky]] and Ivan Radulov (both 10/15), ahead of [[Evgeny Ermenkov]], just a half point off the pace.
*The 1st [[World Computer Chess Championship]] takes place in [[Stockholm]]. It is won by the program [[Kaissa]] (USSR), followed by [[Chess (Northwestern University)|Chess 4.0]] (USA), which defeats third placed Ribbit (CAN) in a play-off for second. There are many interesting games and some surprising moves arise from tactical complications. The championship shows that chess computers are making rapid progress, although the quality of the [[Endgame (chess)|endgame play]] is still very poor and poses no threat to human players of average strength.
*The [[People's Republic of China]] makes an application for membership of FIDE.
*The first chess book published in the United States by a major publisher using [[algebraic chess notation|algebraic notation]] is printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chess History &amp; Chronology - Bill Wall |url=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/history.txt |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kfLHqMvc?url=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/history.txt |archivedate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2016 Christy Ring Cup''' was the 12th staging of the [[Christy Ring Cup]] hurling championship since its establishment by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] in 2005. The competition began on Saturday 23 April 2016 and ended on Saturday 25 June 2016.

[[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] were the [[2015 Christy Ring Cup|2015 champions]] and were promoted to the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.gaa.ie/gaa-news-and-videos/daily-news/1/0606151905-nolan-inspires-kingdom-to-ring-cup-final-win-over-derry/ |title=Nolan inspires Kingdom to Ring Cup final win over Derry |date=6 June 2015 |work=GAA.ie |accessdate=16 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702063640/http://www.gaa.ie/gaa-news-and-videos/daily-news/1/0606151905-nolan-inspires-kingdom-to-ring-cup-final-win-over-derry/ |archivedate=2 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first final on 4 June 2016 a mistake was made in recording the score.

===Controversy===

During the final a point that wasn't actually scored was awarded to Meath on the official scoreboard. At the end of the match the score was recorded as Meath 2-18 Antrim 1-20 and the referee mistakenly confirmed this score. Meath were awarded the trophy. On 7 June 2016 the [[Glossary of Gaelic games terms#C|CCCC]] ruled that the final score was a draw, 2-17 to 1-20, and that the match should be replayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/confirmed-christy-ring-final-between-meath-and-antrim-to-be-replayed-34779686.html|title= Confirmed: Christy Ring final between Meath and Antrim to be replayed|date=7 June 2016|work=RTE Sport|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antrim lose Christy Ring Cup final against Meath after claims of scoreline blunder|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/gaelic-games/36453794|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''A. Le Coq Arena''' (known as '''Lilleküla Stadium''' prior to sponsorship and during [[UEFA]] competitions) is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Tallinn]], Estonia. It is the home ground of football club [[FC Flora|Flora]] and the [[Estonia national football team]]. With a capacity of 14,405, it is the largest football stadium in Estonia.

==History==
In July 1998, [[FC Flora|Flora]] submitted a planning application to Tallinn City Council, requesting permission to build a new stadium on wasteland between railway lines in [[Kitseküla]], close to the border with neighbouring [[Lilleküla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postimees.ee/2549619/prugimaest-saab-staadion|title=Prügimäest saab staadion|trans-title=Waste ground will become a stadium|work=Postimees|date=25 July 1998|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving the council's approval, Flora signed a 99-year lease on the estate and construction began in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epl.delfi.ee/archive/fc-flora-rajab-lillekulasse-jalgpallistaadioni?id=50846002|title=FC Flora rajab Lillekülasse jalgpallistaadioni|trans-title=FC Flora will build a football stadium in Lilleküla|work=Eesti Päevaleht|date=19 October 2000|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was designed by Haldo Oravas. 

The stadium was officially opened 2 June 2001, with a [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2002 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match between [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. The match saw Estonia's [[Andres Oper]] become the first player to score at the new stadium when he scored in the 65th minute, with the full-time result being a 2–4 loss.
[[File:Samba boys kick off the match in Tallinn.jpg|thumb|left|A. Le Coq Arena during Estonia [[Exhibition match|friendly]] against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 2009]]
In January 2002, [[A. Le Coq]] bought naming rights for the stadium and Lilleküla Stadium was renamed A. Le Coq Arena. 
[[File:AEROSMITH - WORLD TOUR 2007- A.Le Coq ARENA, Tallinn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aerosmith]] concert held at A. Le Coq Arena in 2007]]
Aside from football and other sporting events, several concerts have been held at A. Le Coq Arena, such as [[Lenny Kravitz]] in 2005 and [[Aerosmith]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="ejl"/&gt;

During the [[2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]], the stadium hosted 6 out of 15 tournament matches, including the final.

In 2012, Flora completed the transfer ownership of the Lilleküla Football Complex, including A. Le Coq Arena, to the [[Estonian Football Association]].

In September 2016, it was announced that the stadium would host the [[2018 UEFA Super Cup]]. In preparation for the match, the stadium's capacity was increased from 10,000 to 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/news/newsid=2398008.html|title=Tallinn to stage 2018 UEFA Super Cup|publisher=UEFA.com|date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 UEFA Super Cup match between the [[2017–18 UEFA Champions League]] winners [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and the [[2017–18 UEFA Europa League]] winners [[Atlético Madrid]] was held on 15 August 2018, with Atlético Madrid winning 4–2 in extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/news/newsid=2398008.html|title=Atlético win UEFA Super Cup in extra time|publisher=UEFA.com|date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Berglund Center''' (originally called the '''Roanoke Civic Center''') is a 10,500-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] located in the [[Williamson Road, Roanoke, Virginia|Williamson Road]] neighborhood of [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. It was built in 1971. It was the former home to the [[Roanoke Dazzle]] [[basketball]] [[team]], as well as the [[Roanoke Express]] and [[Roanoke Valley Vipers]] [[ice hockey]] teams. Currently, it is the home of the [[Roanoke Rail Yard Dawgs]] of the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]], [[Virginia Tech]], [[Radford University]] and [[Roanoke College]] men's [[ice hockey]] teams.  The arena is also the home of the annual boys basketball games between Roanoke's two city high schools, [[Patrick Henry High School (Roanoke, Virginia)|Patrick Henry High School]] and [[William Fleming High School]].

== History ==
Opened in October 1971, the Roanoke Civic Center was also the former home of the [[American Basketball Association (1967-1976)|American Basketball Association]] (1967-1976) professional basketball franchise [[Virginia Squires]]. The Squires played there (in addition to the [[Norfolk Scope]], [[Richmond Coliseum]] and [[Hampton Coliseum]]; all within the state of Virginia) from 1971 to 1972. The Virginia Squires used the Civic Center for only one season due to low attendance, before folding in 1976. [[Elvis Presley]] performed there in 1972, 1974, 1976, and was due to return in 1977, about a week after his death. It hosted 251 [[professional wrestling]] events between 1975 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=shows&amp;sort=ort&amp;land=3&amp;region=17&amp;stadt=245&amp;arena=652 Shows held at the Roanoke Civic Center, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] held [[Fall Brawl (1994)]] there  and ''[[Monday Nitro]]'' on March 31, 1997. [[WWE]] brought ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' on December 1, 1997, May 6, 2013, and November 17, 2014. The 1977-1981 [[Southern Conference]] men's basketball tournaments were held there as well.

From 2001 to 2006, professional basketball was active again at the Roanoke Civic Center, with the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[D-League]] franchise, the Roanoke Dazzle. College basketball was also recently contested there, in the form of the [[Big South Conference]] men's basketball tournaments in 2001 and 2002. The [[Metro Conference]] men's basketball tournament was held here in 1991. When both the Dazzle and Vipers folded after the 2005-06 season, the Roanoke Civic Center was left with 60 open dates to fill for the upcoming fall and winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jon C.|last=Scott|title=Hockey Night in Dixie: Minor Pro Hockey in the American South|year=2006|publisher=Heritage House Publishing Company Ltd.|page=4|isbn=1-894974-21-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, nearly two-thirds of these open dates were awarded to the Virginia Tech, Radford University and Roanoke College hockey clubs, the arena's primary tenants until 2016, when the [[Mississippi Surge]] relocated to Roanoke, becoming the [[Roanoke Rail Yard Dawgs|Rail Yard Dawgs]].

== Overview ==
Built at the same time as the Scope and Richmond Coliseum, the Roanoke Civic Center is the area's premier sports and entertainment venue. There are eight restrooms and six concession stands at the arena, which has a {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} ceiling height and 10 spotlights as well as a portable stage that is no larger than 60-by-40 feet.  There are 8,372 permanent seats at the arena; the arena floor measures over {{convert|20000|sqft|m2}}.  The Eclipse forms the Coliseum's half-house configuration.  The arena recently began a $6.2 million renovation project expected to last until 2016.  The arena's heating system has been replaced, and plans call for upgrades to the arena's electrical system and to all arena entrances, as well as for all seats to be replaced.

Adjacent are a {{convert|14396|sqft|m2|sing=on}} exhibit hall with {{convert|10000|sqft|m2}} of column-free space, and a 2,440-seat theatre that can be used for concerts, Broadway shows, the [[Roanoke Symphony Orchestra]] and other special events.  The theatre features a {{convert|55|ft|m|sing=on}}-by-105-foot stage; 1,625 seats in the theatre are in the orchestra level, 295 in the loge and 520 in the balcony.  After recent renovations, the facility became known as the Roanoke Performing Arts Theatre.

A {{convert|46000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} special events center was added to the Civic Center in 2007; it is used for trade shows, meetings, conventions and other special events.  It can hold up to 3,066 seated, 5,850 standing.  The ceiling height is 32 feet.

{{About||the film|The Birdcage|the car|Maserati Tipo 61|the rifle feature|Flash suppressor}}
[[File:Kersting - Zwei Kinder vor einem Papageienbauer.jpg|thumb|Two children with parrot cage (painting by [[Georg Friedrich Kersting]], ca. 1835)]]
[[Image:Birdcage.jpg|thumb|A cage designed for medium-large parrots, with a playtop.]]

A '''birdcage''' (or '''bird cage''') is a [[cage (enclosure)|cage]] designed to house [[bird]]s as [[pet]]s.

Antique (or antique-style) birdcages are often popular as collectors' items or as household decor but most are not suitable for housing live birds, being too small, improper shape, using unsafe materials or construction. Good quality cages designed for pet birds are more suitable.

==Design and size==
In general, the larger and the more active the bird, the larger the cage one should use. The amount of time the bird will spend in the cage each day is also a factor.  A bird that is caged most of the time requires far more space than a bird caged only at night.

Some birds have special requirements. [[Amazon parrot|Amazons]] and [[cockatiel]]s prefer horizontal bars, as they like to climb. Messy eaters should have a seed skirt to catch food. Breeding birds may require a nest or breeding box and a larger size cage. Smart birds, like [[parrot]]s and [[crow]]s, need secure latching mechanisms to prevent them from figuring them out, and often require toys and/or play-stands to keep them entertained.  Parrots in general tend to gnaw on cages, with larger [[macaws]] known to tear bars from flimsy cages. Zinc coated cages or [[chicken wire]] could cause toxicity to parrots over a number of years.

Most parrot cages are made of wrought iron and painted with a non-toxic paint referred to as powder-coating. A newer trend  is cages made of solid stainless steel. Large parrot cages made of stainless steel are costly but will outlast a powder-coated cage by 5 to 6 times. The materials used to build the cages greatly affect the price. While small cages are relatively cheap, large [[parrot]]-sized cages are expensive. 

[[File:Eolophus roseicapilla -Billabong Sanctuary-8b.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Galah]] in an aviary with wide bar spacing.]]

==Safety==
A cage for a tame pet bird which is allowed out daily should be large enough to allow it to easily extend its wings fully without hitting cage sides or toys or objects within the cage.  In some countries, it is illegal to house a pet bird in a cage that does not permit it to spread its wings.  Wingspans of common pet birds range from approximately {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} for a budgie and {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} for a cockatiel up to as much as {{convert|36|-|48|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} for the larger macaws. Rectangular cages have replaced rounded cages due to the damaged wings caused by non bird friendly round cages.

Untamed birds which are not allowed out of their cages regularly, such as most finches and canaries, require larger cages that are long enough to permit some flight.  The bars should be spaced so that curious birds cannot stick their heads out of the cage and become stuck. The cage should also have non-toxic paint, because birds tend to gnaw at the cage, and if the paint is consumed, they can die from poisoning.
[[File:Forgotton Songs Installation, 50 Bird Cages Floating in the Sky.jpg|thumb|Birdcages used in the public artwork [[Forgotten Songs (artwork)|''Forgotten Songs'']], Sydney.]]
Cages should also be equipped with appropriate perches.  There should be several diameters of perches available, but the diameter should be large enough so that the bird's toes are unable to overlap or completely wrap around the perch.  Flight cages and aviaries should be equipped with perches at each end with open space in the middle for flight.

In both [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]], a '''blood replacement''' (also referred to as a '''blood substitution''' or '''blood bin''') is a special kind of [[substitution (sport)|substitution]] which can be used in the case of a player having to leave the field of play temporarily to have a [[wound]] attended to. Both rugby union and rugby league are physically demanding games, so musculoskeletal injuries are common, as well as injuries to the head and neck, and fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6728e1e2-7b1e-491f-a527-5f79258a1549%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=4204|title = Match and training injuries in rugby league.|last = King|first = Doug|date = 1 February 2010|journal = Sports Medicine|doi = 10.2165/11319740-000000000-00000|pmid = |volume=40|pages=163–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the IRB 2011 Rugby World Cup, a study was conducted to determine the frequency and nature of the injuries sustained. It confirmed that rugby, like many other contact sports, has a high incidence of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5f53e27e-66f7-4806-bbdc-9864dcd470d5%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=125|title = Rugby world cup 2011: International rugby board injury surveillance study|last = Fuller|first = Colin|date = 2012-04-25|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|doi = 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091155|pmid = |access-date = 9 June 2012|volume=47|pages=1184–1191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rugby union ==

In rugby union, blood replacements  are provided for by Law 3.10 of the [[International Rugby Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irb.com/NR/rdonlyres/A1F47EAA-EBD7-43F9-BD4F-64DC7368A6C2/0/060704LGLAWSEN_06_LAW3.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027193038/http://www.irb.com/NR/rdonlyres/A1F47EAA-EBD7-43F9-BD4F-64DC7368A6C2/0/060704LGLAWSEN_06_LAW3.pdf |date=October 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A player who has been wounded may be replaced for up to fifteen minutes (running time), during which he or she may receive first-aid treatment to stanch the flow of blood and dress the wound.  The player may then ask the referee to return to the pitch of play. The return-to-play regulation is a regulation in rugby union that reduces the likelihood of premature return-to-play by injured players. However studies have shown that there is a high rate of non-compliance with this regulation and therefore highlights the need for implementation and dissemination of the return-to-play regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6728e1e2-7b1e-491f-a527-5f79258a1549%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=10&amp;hid=4204|title = Compliance with return-to-play regulations following concussion in Australian schoolboy and community rugby union players.|last = Finch|first = Caroline|date = 1 April 2012|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2011.085332|pmid = |access-date = 2011-06-24|volume=46|pages=735–740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rugby league ==

In rugby league, blood replacement substitutions are enforced by the referee after he has noticed that a player is bleeding.  This change takes the place of one of the allocated 10 replacements that teams are allowed.  In the case of misconduct, where the incident leading to the injury has been either placed on report or sin-binned or sent off, then the replacement is free (does not count) however when the player returns this counts as an interchange. The blood bin was first used in 1991.

== Gamesmanship ==

Fake blood injuries have been used for tactical benefit, to enable teams to withdraw a player they may wish to bring back on later. A notable example was the "[[Bloodgate]]" incident, where [[Harlequin FC|Harlequins]] wing [[Tom Williams (rugby player, born 1983)|Tom Williams]] came off the field with what turned out to be a faked blood injury in order to facilitate a tactical substitution. An investigation by the ERC and the RFU revealed that blood injuries had also been faked by Harlequins to enable tactical substitutions on four previous occasions. These findings resulted in a four-month ban for Williams, a three-year ban for former director of rugby Dean Richards and a two-year ban for physiotherapist Steph Brennan as well as a £260,000 fine for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon Austin |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/simonaustin/2009/08/bloodgate_brings_deano_down.html |title=Sport: Simon Austin: Bloodgate brings Deano down |publisher=BBC |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This area is divided by a line drawn on the floor that divides the playing field. It is played between two teams, each with 4 players. The object of the game is to launch a [[ball]] (called "bombo") by hand or racquet so that it bounces into the opponent's field without being returned.

It is an old sport, created before the fifteenth century, by Precolombian people. The sport is widely practiced in [[Nariño Department|Nariño]], [[Colombia]], and is the [[national sport]] of [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tenis Pastuso en el Ecuador |url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article163177.html|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Chaza was created in the 14th century by [[indigenous communities]] who inhabited the area that is currently on the border of [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]]. In the beginning it was played with a heavy [[leather]] ball, which was thrown by hand.

== Game Rules ==
[[File:Bombo de chaza.jpg|thumb| Bombo ([[racket (sports equipment)|racket]]) for Chaza]]
This game can be played with hands or with a wooden [[racquet]], The ball is lined with goatskin and called a "bombo" weighing 70-90 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Chaza', un deporte típico de Pasto|url=http://expedicionrcn.noticiasrcn.com/videos/chaza-un-deporte-tipico-de-pasto-expedicion-6591|website=RCN Televisión|date=20 May 2014|language=Spanish|access-date=2015-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105232858/http://expedicionrcn.noticiasrcn.com/videos/chaza-un-deporte-tipico-de-pasto-expedicion-6591#|archive-date=2015-01-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Bola vasca.jpg|thumb|Ball for chaza]]
As in [[volleyball]], players rotate, which is why the field has a line (6 on each side) indicating which position each should play.

Points are scored as for [[tennis]], i.e., 15, 30, 40 and the point. When a team gets 6 points and maintains a minimum difference of 2 points over their rival, it wins the set. When a team wins 2 sets, it wins the game.

Each point is also scored as in tennis, looking for the opposing team to fail to return the ball before it bounces 2 times within their field.

The field is rectangular and concrete and 110 meters long and 10 meters wide, divided by a line drawn on the ground.

[[File:Hockey field metric.svg|300px|thumb|Standard pitch measurements. The field of play is {{convert|91.4|x|55.0|m|yd|0}} with an area of {{convert|5027|m2|acre|2}}.]]

A '''hockey pitch''' is the playing surface for the game of [[field hockey]]. Historically, the game was played on natural turf (grass) but nowadays it is predominantly played on an [[artificial turf]]. The transition onto artificial pitches came during the 1970s and was made mandatory for major competitions in 1976. All the lines, markings and goal specifications are outlined by the [[International Hockey Federation]] in "The Rules of Hockey".

All line markings on the pitch form part of the area which they define. For example, a ball on the side line is still in the field of play; a ball on the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; a foul committed over the 23-metre (25-yard) line has occurred in the 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.

Due to the original formulation of the rules in England, the standard dimensions of a hockey pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The rules are now expressed explicitly in metric dimensions (since 1998), although the use of the imperial terms remains common in some countries.

==Field of play==
[[File:Sydney Olympic Park Hockey Centre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coloured pitches are used to distinguish the field of play (green) from the run-off (red).]]
The hockey pitch is rectangular in shape. The longer perimeter edges are called the ''side line'', the opposing shorter edges are referred toe ''back line'' and the portion of this between the goal posts is known as the ''goal line''. The side line must measure 91.40&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;yd) and the back line should measure 55.00&amp;nbsp;m (60&amp;nbsp;yd). There must be a minimum run-off of 2&amp;nbsp;m at the sidelines and 3&amp;nbsp;m at the backlines which may be a different surface for the final metre. All line markings must be white and 75 millimetres wide. In each corner of the pitch, a corner flag of no more than 300&amp;nbsp;mm square is attached to a post of height 1.20&amp;ndash;1.50&amp;nbsp;m.{{sfn|FIH Rules|2012|pp=8, 48&amp;ndash;49, 54}}&lt;ref name="GB Pitches"/&gt;

Historically, the pitch dimensions were [[Imperial units|imperial]] and were replaced by [[Metric system|metric]] equivalents in 1998. The first recorded rules represented what London clubs were using at the time. [[Surbiton Hockey Club]]'s minutes from 1876 stated that pitches were to be "{{convert|100|-|150|yd|m}} long and {{convert|50|-|80|yd|m}} wide". Rules by the Hockey Association of England in 1886 specified "100 yards long by {{convert|55|to|60|yd|m}} wide".&lt;ref name="FIH History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HockeyMuseum"/&gt; In 1905, the [[Hockey Rules Board|International Rules Board]] allowed the width of the pitch to be "up to {{convert|66|yd|m}}" but this decision was reversed in 1909.&lt;ref name="Moorebank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moorebankhockey.com.au/about/history-of-hockey/|publisher=Moorebank Liverpool District Hockey Club|title=History of hockey|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the current width of 60 yards was written into the rules.&lt;ref name="FIH History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/en/fih/history/ruleshistory|publisher=[[International Hockey Federation]]|title=History of the Rules|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HockeyMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeymuseum.org/Default.aspx?id=556652|publisher=National Hockey Museum|title=Rules &amp; Umpiring|first=David|last=Wareham|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On artificial surfaces, the field of play should be coloured green, ultramarine blue or signal blue. It is permitted for the run-off portion of the pitch to be an alternative colour.{{sfn|FIH Pitches|2014|loc=p.41 §7.14}}

==Goal==
[[File:Olympische Spelen te Rome, hockeywedstrijd Nederland tegen Nieuw Zeeland, Bestanddeelnr 911-5850.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A hockey goal at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. The goal is deeper at ground level with side and backboards around the base.]]
Goals consist of two upright posts placed equidistant from the centre of the backline, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar. The inner edges of the posts must be {{convert|3.66|m|yd|0}} apart, and the lower edge of the crossbar must be {{convert|2.14|m|ft|0}} above the ground.
The goalposts and crossbar must be white and rectangular in shape with width {{convert|50|mm|in|0}} and a depth of {{convert|50|to|75|mm|in|0}}.

The goal must be at least 1.20&amp;nbsp;m deep at ground level and at least 0.90&amp;nbsp;m deep at crossbar level. The goal area must be delimited at ground level by a goal backboard and two sideboards of height {{convert|460|mm|in}}. Affixed to these boards, the posts and crossbar is a net to stop the ball.{{sfn|FIH Rules|2012|pp=52&amp;ndash;54}}

The first hockey goals were "{{convert|7|ft|m}} tall posts placed {{convert|6|yd|m}} apart" but were reduced to {{convert|4|yd|m}} apart in the 1886 rules. In 1987, a rule was introduced so that at [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|penalty corners]] "the first hit at goal should not cross the goal-line higher than {{convert|18|in|mm}}". This saw the introduction of a sideboard and backboard to the goals which are now mandatory.&lt;ref name="FIH History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HockeyMuseum"/&gt;

==Circle==
[[File:London Olympics Hockey GB vs Japan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A view of the ''penalty circle'' (solid line), the broken circle 5&amp;nbsp;m from it, and the ''penalty spot''.]]
A goal is scored when the ball passes completely over the goal line but only if the ball was played by an offensive player in the ''penalty circle''. Additionally, the circle marks the area a goalkeeper may play the ball with any part of his body and the area where an infringement by a defender results in a penalty corner. The terminology ''circle'' (or ''D'') is widely used although the area is actually formed by a {{convert|3.66|m|yd|0|adj=on}} straight line, parallel to the goal&amp;nbsp;line, connected to two {{convert|14.63|m|yd|0|adj=on}} quadrant arcs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Helen|last=Connolly|year=2005|publisher=[[The Rosen Publishing Group]]|title=Field Hockey: Rules, Tips, Strategy, and Safety|ISBN=1404201823|pp=22&amp;ndash;23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|FIH Rules|2012|p=50}}

The 1876 rules stated that "no goals shall be allowed if the ball be hit from a distance of more than {{convert|15|yd|m}} from the nearest goalpost". A visible "striking circle" with "radius of 15&amp;nbsp;yards" was codified in 1886.&lt;ref name="FIH History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HockeyMuseum"/&gt; The radius of the circle was increased to {{convert|16|yd|m}} in 1951 for men's hockey and 1968 for women's hockey.&lt;ref name="Moorebank"/&gt; Any free-hit within 5 m of the circle has slightly different rules from others concerning other players’ distance; a broken circle 5&amp;nbsp;m from the penalty circle denotes this location.{{sfn|FIH Rules|2012|p=50}}

A ''penalty spot'' is centrally positioned directly in front of the goal and used for a [[penalty stroke]]. The spot is 150&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and its centre is 6.475&amp;nbsp;m from the outside of the goal line.{{sfn|FIH Rules|2012|p=50}} Penalty strokes were introduced in 1963 for deliberately stopping a certain goal;&lt;ref name="FIH History"/&gt; they were originally taken {{convert|8|yd|m}} from goal. In 1973, a stroke could also be awarded for a deliberate foul in the circle and the spot was moved to {{convert|7|yd|m}} from goal the following year.&lt;ref name="Moorebank"/&gt;

==Other markings==
[[File:Hockey short corner markings.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Simon Gougnard]] prepares to take a penalty corner from the 10&amp;nbsp;m mark. The 5&amp;nbsp;m line above demarcates the closest position a defender may stand.]]

A ''half-way line'', parallel to the back line, divides the pitch in two. The start of each period of play and resumption of play following a goal starts with all players in the half they are defending. The line was also used for the obselete [[Offside (field hockey)|offside rule]].&lt;ref name="FIH History"/&gt;

Each half of the pitch is then divided again by a line, referred to as the ''23&amp;nbsp;metre line'' or ''25&amp;nbsp;yard line'', positioned 22.90&amp;nbsp;m{{sfn|FIH Rules|2012|p=52}} from each back line. Historically, this was first used to resume play after the ball passed over the back line and marked by flags at the side of the pitch. In 1949, deliberate defensive offenses in this area resulted in a penalty corner. From 1961, players on the defensive team who were not involved at the penalty corner stood behind this line (this was then moved to the half-way line two years later). The line was also used for the offside rule between 1987 until the rule was abolished in 1996.&lt;ref name="FIH History"/&gt; Nowadays, there are detailed rules regarding fouls and free-hits in the 23&amp;nbsp;metre region of the pitch.{{sfn|FIH Rules|2012|loc=pp.30&amp;ndash;31 §13.2}} Since 2015, the ''23&amp;nbsp;metre line'' has also been used for the attacking team to resume play when it has gone over the back line (this replaced ''long corners'').{{sfn|FIH Rules|2015|loc=p.23 §7.4}}

There are additional markings 300&amp;nbsp;mm long and perpendicular to the back line that denote distances of 10&amp;nbsp;m and 5&amp;nbsp;m from each goal post. These are relevant at a [[Penalty corner (field hockey)|penalty corner]]; the former is the mark from which the attacking team takes the penalty corner and the latter is the closest position which a defender may stand. These marks had been {{convert|5|and|10|yd|m}} in earlier versions of the rules.&lt;ref name="FIH History"/&gt; There is a similar mark 5&amp;nbsp;m from along the side line (from where ''long corners'' were formally taken) and a mark 14.6&amp;nbsp;m along the side line indicating the level of the top of the penalty circle. There are also 150&amp;nbsp;mm long markings where the goal posts are situated.{{sfn|FIH Rules|2012|pp=48&amp;ndash;52}}

"artificial grass permits easier ball control and this in itself helps to reduce the number of infringements of the rules—which means less whistle and fewer stoppages. The game thus becomes easier to follow, as well as being a faster spectacle and much more interesting from a spectator point of view."&lt;ref name="World Hockey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IndiaBook"/&gt;

Historically, the game was developed on natural grass turf. However, in 1976, the [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH) made artificial pitches mandatory at all major competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An outside chance|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/predicting-winners-becomes-a-gamble-in-hockey-post-advent-of-synthetic-surfaces/1/308455.html|author=M.

However, due to [[water conservation]] efforts, this is not seen as a long-term sustainable option and alternative elite surfaces that do not require water are being researched.{{sfn|FIH Pitches|2014|p=1}}

There are three main types of artificial hockey surface:&lt;ref name="GB Pitches"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greatbritainhockey.co.uk/library-media/documents/Hockey%20Pitch%20Basic%20Info.pdf|title=Hockey Pitches – Basic Information|publisher=[[Great Britain Hockey]]|format=PDF|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|FIH Pitches|2014|loc=p.8 §2}}{{sfn|FIH Pitches|2014|loc=p.19 §5.5.1}}

*'''Unfilled or water-based''' - artificial fibres that are densely packed for stabilisation, requires irrigation or watering to avoid pitch wear
*'''Dressed or sand-dressed''' - artificial fibres can be less densely packed and sand supports the fibres for part of the [[Pile (textile)|pile depth]]
*'''Filled or sand-filled''' - artificial fibres can be longer and less densely packed and sand supports the fibres for 100% of the pile depth

On water-based pitches, shorter fibres and wetted turf reduce friction and increase the speed at which the game can be played. However, these pitches require watering before, during and after the game and maintenance costs are significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/sports-story/4237348-waterloo-man-pitches-field-hockey-of-dreams-/|title=Waterloo man pitches ‘field hockey of dreams’|first=Mark|last=Bryson|work=[[Waterloo Region Record|The Record]]|date=27 November 2013|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsr.wa.gov.au/hockey1|title=Sport Specific Requirements: Hockey|publisher=[[Department of Sport and Recreation (Western Australia)|Department of Sport and Recreation]]|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sand-dressed pitches cost more than sand-filled pitches but are preferable for hockey as there is an absence of sand close to the playing surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/58954/AFGS_Part_2-v2.pdf|title=Artificial Grass for Sport|page=31|publisher=Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure|accessdate=14 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207224356/http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/58954/AFGS_Part_2-v2.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a multi-purpose surface suitable for sports including [[association football]] and [[tennis]] is often required and hockey may not be the predominant sport. There are many different specifications and categorisations for artificial turf including shock absorption, surface rebound, friction, and strength outlined by the [[International Hockey Federation]].{{sfn|FIH Pitches|2014|pp=43&amp;ndash;46}} Recently, longer-pile ''third-generation'' or ''3G'' pitches have become popular, especially for football, but these do not usually meet the FIH's test criteria; they are often too inconsistent and slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 2010|url=http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/core/core_picker/download.asp?id=5280|title=Long Pile Turf (3G) Pitches|format=PDF|publisher=[[England Hockey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

The ''World Hockey'' magazine reported on the first hockey tournament played on an artificial pitch in 1975&amp;mdash;a trial event in Montreal prior to the Olympics&amp;mdash;and said the surface had "enormous benefits".&lt;ref name="World Hockey"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hockey on an Artificial Pitch|date=October 1975|pages=10|volume=24|journal=World Hockey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndiaBook"/&gt; Steve Ruskin, of [[Sports Illustrated]], said that "A slow, analytical game gave way to one of nonstop, true-hop action."&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; However, it has been stated that the decision to make artificial surfaces mandatory greatly favoured more affluent Western countries who could afford these new pitches.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/headon/entry/the-untold-story-of-how-india-lost-hockey-supremacy|title=The untold story of how India lost hockey supremacy|first=Minhaz|last=Merchant|date=15 January 2013|work=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the switch to an artificial surface the [[India men's national field hockey team|Indian men's hockey team]] were dominant, winning seven of the eight Olympic gold medals between 1928 and 1964.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.si.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1008434/index.htm|date=22 July 1996|volume=85|issue=4|first=Steve|last=Ruskin|title=Reign on the Wane|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|pages=170–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, Indian hockey player [[Ajit Pal Singh]] stated that despite its size "[India] can afford only 12 or so AstroTurf fields".&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; [[Sardara Singh]], captain of the Indian men's hockey team, said that "hockey players in India play on astroturf{{sic}} for the first time at the age of 19 or 20 and find it hard to adapt."&lt;ref name="TOI"/&gt; However, the [[Pakistan men's national field hockey team|Pakistan hockey team]] have performed well following the change of surface despite the country being worse off economically and having fewer artificial pitches.&lt;ref name="IndiaBook"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Boria|last1=Majumdar|first2=Nalin|last2=Mehta|year=2009|isbn=0415804973|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pp=85&amp;ndash;89|title=Olympics: The India Story}}&lt;/ref&gt; When describing the change of surface, Ruskin said that "for India it was like starting over, with all nations even in field hockey."&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

The '''Georgia Dome''' was a [[Stadium#Types|domed stadium]] in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern]] [[United States]].  Located in [[Atlanta]] between [[downtown Atlanta|downtown]] to the east and [[Vine City]] to the west, it was owned and operated by the State of Georgia as part of the [[Georgia World Congress Center]] Authority. Its successor, [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]], was built adjacent to the south and opened on August 26, [[2017 Atlanta Falcons season|2017]]. The Georgia Dome was demolished on November 20, 2017.&lt;ref name="GA_Dome_Demolition"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Jill|title=Georgia Dome imploded after 25 years of use|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/20/sport/georgia-dome-imploded/index.html|accessdate=November 20, 2017|work=CNN|date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgia Dome was the home stadium for the [[Atlanta Falcons]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and the [[Georgia State University]] [[Georgia State Panthers football|Panthers football]] team. It hosted 25 editions of the [[Peach Bowl]] (January 1993 through December 2016) and 23 [[SEC Championship Game]]s ([[1994 SEC Championship Game|1994]]−[[2016 SEC Championship Game|2016]]). In addition, the Georgia Dome also hosted several soccer matches since 2009 with attendances over 50,000. In its 25-year lifespan, the Georgia Dome hosted over 1,400 events attended by over 37 million people.&lt;ref name="GA_Dome_Liquidation"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Tim|title=Liquidating the Georgia Dome: Memorabilia sale underway|url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/liquidating-the-georgia-dome-memorabilia-sale-underway/Uh18WRa51Fi2hgunRCrFYO/|accessdate=October 10, 2017|work=The Atlanta-Journal Constitution|date=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgia Dome was the only stadium in the world to host the Olympics, Super Bowl and Final Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/sport/georgia-dome-final-game/index.html|title=Georgia Dome farewell for Atlanta Falcons|first=Jill Martin,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gwcca.org/dome/final-year/|title=Final Year - Georgia World Congress Center Authority|website=www.gwcca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its debut in 1992, the Georgia Dome was the second-largest covered stadium in the world by capacity, behind the [[Pontiac Silverdome]]; it was also surpassed by [[AT&amp;T Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]], and [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]].

==History==
===Construction===
The Georgia Dome was completed in [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|1992]] at a cost of [[United States dollar|$]]214&amp;nbsp;million, which came from the [[Georgia General Assembly]], making it one of the largest state-funded construction projects in Georgia history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ajc.com/news/local/georgia-dome-through-the-years/uFi47qtjlzk1egIWA2EUvK/ |title=Georgia Dome through the years |work=ajc |access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gpbnews.org/post/georgia-dome-named-iconic-site-georgia-historical-society |title=Georgia Dome Named An Iconic Site By The Georgia Historical Society |last=Terrell |first=Ross |work=GPB News |access-date=2018-11-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium seated 71,228 for [[American football|football]], approximately 80,000 for [[concert]]s, and 71,000 for [[basketball]] when the dome was fully open, and 40,000 for basketball and gymnastics when the dome was sectioned off (one half closed off by a large curtain).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://georgiahistory.com/ghmi_marker_updated/georgia-dome/ |title=Georgia Dome |work=Georgia Historical Society |access-date=2018-11-23 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most Georgia State football games, the dome was configured with 28,155 seats, with tickets for only the bulk of the lower level and the club-level seats on sale.&lt;ref name=GSU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://admin.xosn.com/pdf8/772544.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=12700&amp;KEY=VDXQRKPPIXCHUCF.20110719142449 |title=Georgia Dome Seating Chart |work=[[Georgia State Panthers|Georgia State Athletics]] |format=PDF |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record for overall attendance at the Georgia Dome came during a  college football game, with 80,892 at the [[SEC Championship Game]] in [[2008 SEC Championship Game|2008]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;http://secsports.com/index.php?s=&amp;url_channel_id=2&amp;url_article_id=11911&amp;change_well_id=2  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208081746/http://secsports.com/index.php?s=&amp;url_channel_id=2&amp;url_article_id=11911&amp;change_well_id=2 |date=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure was located on {{convert|9.19|acre|hectare|2}} of land; the Dome had a height of {{convert|271|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, a structure length of {{convert|746|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, a structure width of {{convert|607|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and a total floor area of {{convert|102150|sqft|sqm|0}}. The dome was the largest [[Wire rope|cable]]-supported dome in the world. Its roof was made of [[teflon]]-coated fiberglass fabric and had an area of {{convert|374584|sqft|sqm|0}}. From its completion until the December 31, 1999 opening of the {{convert|20|acre|hectare|2|adj=on}} [[Millennium Dome]] in London, it was the largest hooked domed structure of any type in the world.

===Surface===
The Georgia Dome originally used [[AstroTurf]] artificial surface for its football events. In 2003, [[Arthur Blank]], the new owner of Atlanta Falcons, funded the installation of the new infilled [[FieldTurf]] artificial surface system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketcity.com/Chick-fil-A-Bowl-Event-Guide.html|title=Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl Event Guide|website=www.ticketcity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/history-georgia-dome-sec-championship/ |title=History of the Georgia Dome and its SEC Championship impact |date=2014-12-03 |work=Saturday Down South |access-date=2018-11-23 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renovations===
In 2006, the Atlanta Falcons and the Georgia World Congress Center Authority announced a $300 million renovation to the Georgia Dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/09/11/daily32.html |title=Falcons to pay for Georgia Dome facelift |work=Atlanta Business Chronicle |access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was separated into two stages. The first stage, which took place before the 2007 NFL season, focused on updating the premium seating areas, including the creation of eight 'super-suites' as well as an owners' club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2007/07/Dome_improvement_on_schedule.aspx AlantaFalcons.com: Striking changes usher in new era for Dome] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516072430/http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2007/07/Dome_improvement_on_schedule.aspx |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the exterior of the stadium was repainted, replacing the original teal and maroon color scheme with a red, black, and silver theme to match the Falcons' team colors; the stadium's original teal seats were replaced with red seats in the lower and upper levels and black seats in the middle level. The entrance gates and concourses were also renovated and updated before the 2008 football season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2007/10/21-31/Falcons_Dome_announce_phase_two_renovations.aspx AlantaFalcons.com: Dome, Falcons announce new renovations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516065346/http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2007/10/21-31/Falcons_Dome_announce_phase_two_renovations.aspx |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/MediaLounge/PhotoLanding.aspx?q=Dome%2BRenovation AlantaFalcons.com: Dome Renovations Photo Album] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529224613/http://www.atlantafalcons.com/MediaLounge/PhotoLanding.aspx?q=Dome+Renovation |date=May 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the video screens in both end zones were relocated to a new exterior monument sign on Northside Drive. The interior end zones each received a new and considerably wider High Definition video screen that significantly enhanced views of replays, as well as graphics and digital presentations. A new sound system was installed in the same year, replacing the previous system that was nearly 20 years old.

===Major weather-related issues===
Three years after the completion of the Dome, the integrity of its roof became an issue. During a Falcons pre-season game in August 1995, a severe rainstorm caused water to pool on the fabric, tearing part of the material, and causing a section of the roof to fall into the stadium. The storm was intense enough that the roof panels could be seen moving during the game, and the water and roof material later fell with enough force to smash seats in the upper decks and knock holes in concrete floors. The collapse occurred after fans left the stadium, and no one was injured during the incident. The roof was eventually repaired in a way that prevented similar incidents from occurring in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/22/sports/georgia-dome-is-damaged.html|title=Georgia Dome Is Damaged|date=August 22, 1995|publisher=|via=query.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/23640939/|title=Storm hits Georgia Dome, interrupts SEC play|date=August 23, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2008 Atlanta tornado outbreak]] on March 14, 2008, during the [[2008 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament]], a tornado ripped two holes in the dome during the [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]]–[[Mississippi State Bulldogs men's basketball|Mississippi State]] quarterfinal game, delaying the game for about an hour. The quarterfinal game to follow between the [[2007–08 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky Wildcats]] and [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia Bulldogs]] was postponed until the following day.&lt;ref name="MSNBC1"/&gt; The resulting damage forced the rest of the tournament to be moved to the Alexander Memorial Coliseum, now known as [[McCamish Pavilion]], at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]].&lt;ref

===Replacement and demolition===
{{Main|Mercedes-Benz Stadium}}

[[File:Georgia Dome 2017.JPG|thumb|The Georgia Dome (right) and Mercedes-Benz Stadium on July 2, 2017]]
In 2010, the [[Georgia World Congress Center Authority]] announced plans for a new stadium with a retractable roof just south of the Georgia Dome, with the new stadium receiving approval from the city of Atlanta, Fulton County, and Georgia state governments in 2013 and broke ground and commenced construction in 2014.

The Falcons' final game in the Dome was the [[2016–17 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship Game: Green Bay Packers vs. Atlanta Falcons|2016 NFC Championship Game]] on January 22, 2017, with a 44–21 victory over the [[Green Bay Packers]]. The stadium's final public event took place on March 4 and 5, 2017 with back-to-back [[Monster Jam]] shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Falcons vs. Monster Trucks. Falcons win.|url=http://www.11alive.com/news/local/falcons-vs-monster-trucks-falcons-win/381253170|publisher=[[WXIA-TV]]|accessdate=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Georgia Dome's closing, a group presented a petition to the governor's office to save the stadium from demolition; however, GWCCA officials stated that maintaining two 70,000-seat stadiums was not financially feasible, and the Georgia Dome's fate was already sealed when Mercedes-Benz Stadium was approved in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Doug|title=Last minute effort afoot to prevent Georgia Dome demolition|url=http://www.11alive.com/news/local/last-minute-effort-afoot-to-prevent-georgia-dome-demolition/421230406|publisher=WXIA|accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demolition of the Georgia Dome was intended to begin shortly after the stadium's final event; however, due to construction delays caused by the complexity of Mercedes-Benz Stadium's eight-panel retractable roof, demolition of the Georgia Dome was postponed until the new stadium's [[certificate of occupancy]] could be issued. GWCCA officials stated that the Georgia Dome would remain nominally operational until Mercedes-Benz Stadium was ready; however, the Dome's artificial turf had been removed prior to the announcement of the new stadium's delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tucker|first1=Tim|title=Mercedes-Benz Stadium opening is pushed back again|url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/football/mercedes-benz-stadium-opening-pushed-back-again/wLnfyURmUXYvGcj6iaROMM/|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgia Dome site will become greenspace for [[Tailgate party|tailgating]] at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and other community events; a 600-car parking garage and a high rise convention center hotel are also planned for the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Tim|title=What happens to Georgia Dome after NFC title game?|url=http://www.myajc.com/sports/football/what-happens-georgia-dome-after-nfc-title-game/cvcBKwaI4IHs9S1PU3ashM/|accessdate=March 5, 2017|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2017, GWCCA officials announced that [[The Home Depot]] acquired the naming rights to the {{convert|13|acre|m2|adj=on}} park to be built on part of the Georgia Dome site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stafford|first1=Leon|title=Georgia Dome site to become park after demolition|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/georgia-dome-site-become-park-after-demolition/m3MUfdcQPNgkXCujCsvwJJ/|accessdate=April 26, 2017|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, 2017, Steve Cannon, CEO of the Falcons' parent company AMB Group, stated that construction officials were confident that Mercedes-Benz Stadium would be ready in time for the Falcons' first preseason game, and the process of decommissioning the Georgia Dome had resumed, with the Dome scheduled for implosion on November 20, 2017 at 7:30 am EST.&lt;ref name="Dome Implosion Date Set" /&gt;

In July 2017, GWCCA officials removed equipment they intend to reuse either at Mercedes-Benz Stadium or elsewhere on the GWCC campus while other equipment was liquidated by sealed bids. Most of the seats in the lower and middle bowls were sold in bulk to high schools and colleges while pairs were sold to individuals; most of the upper bowl seats were recycled. The stadium's lower bowl and loading docks were demolished by mid-August. From September 16 to 30, 2017, memorabilia from the Georgia Dome was sold in an online auction format by Schneider Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Tim|title=How the Georgia Dome will be emptied and liquidated|url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/football/how-the-georgia-dome-will-emptied-and-liquidated/k7iyR6lknLWzavXwZlZphP/|accessdate=October 6, 2017|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Tim|title=Inside the Georgia Dome: a shell of its former self|url=http://www.myajc.com/sports/football/inside-the-georgia-dome-shell-its-former-self/7iQbctfY14HRmA5p7ccTGP/|accessdate=August 6, 2017|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GA_Dome_Liquidation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSBTV_1" /&gt;

Demolition officials stated that the pressure from the implosion needed to go up from the roof and not out through the sides to ensure that Mercedes-Benz Stadium and other nearby buildings were not damaged during the demolition; to protect nearby structures, construction felt was placed over the four corners of the Dome, and a {{convert|70|foot|m|0}} tall fence covered in the same material was erected between the Dome and Mercedes-Benz Stadium. To ensure that the roof fell in place during the implosion, parts of the concrete ring supporting the roof had been chipped away and ventilation holes were cut into the roof fabric.&lt;ref name="WSBTV_1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gehlbach|first1=Steve|title=Georgia Dome implosion set for Nov. 20|url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/georgia-dome-implosion-set-for-nov-20/627625852|publisher=WSB-TV|accessdate=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|4800|lb|kg|-1}} of explosives were used to bring the Dome down within 12 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choi|first1=Sophia|title=4,800 pounds of explosives ready to bring down Georgia Dome|url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/4800-pounds-of-explosives-ready-to-bring-down-georgia-dome/648182719|publisher=WSB-TV|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the large exclusion zone required for the demolition, no public viewing areas were made available; additionally, [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority]] officials announced that rail service west of the [[Five Points station]] would be suspended on the day of demolition until MARTA safety inspectors certified that the tunnels which run below the Dome site were safe for trains to operate.

===Drum Corps International===
The stadium also hosted the [[Drum Corps International]] (DCI) Southeastern Championship from 2006-2016. The inaugural event featured 22 drum corps in the old fashioned Prelims/Finals one-day format. During the competition, the stadium was the first, and only indoor rain delay, when an upper deck rain gutter leaked inside the stadium. The 2006 competition was won by [[The Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps|The Cavaliers]], becoming the first of only four corps to win in the 11 years the stadium hosted the event.

From 2007-2014, the [[Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps|Blue Devils]] would win an unprecedented 8 straight victories at the annual Southeastern Championship. The win streak would be snapped in 2015 by [[Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps|Carolina Crown]] with its fan-favorite production of "Inferno"

With the announcement of the [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] to be opened in the summer of 2017, the 2016 tour season would be the last hurrah inside the dome. Though the 2016 season would be the last in the dome, it would prove to be a historical one at that, with the [[Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps|Bluecoats]] powering their way to the top to win the very last competition in the stadium, bringing the corps' first Southeast Championship and later on their first DCI World Championship Title.

While the 2017 show was scheduled to be in the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium, construction delays would make the venue not ready for the July 29 event, which would find a temporary home at [[McEachern High School]] in [[Powder Springs, Georgia]]. DCI aims to host the 2018 Southeastern Championship in the new stadium.

===Wrestling===
The Georgia Dome hosted [[WrestleMania XXVII]] on April 3, 2011 as well as WrestleMania access in the [[Georgia World Congress Center]], WrestleMania XXVII was the last WWE event held in the Georgia Dome.

''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' was hosted in the Georgia Dome twice in 1998 and twice again in 1999, ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' was hosted 4 times in the stadium between 1999 and 2001.

==Facilities==
In 2008, the Georgia Dome started showing safety videos before games, presented by [[Deltalina]], flight attendant "mascot" of [[Delta Air Lines]]. The videos satirize Delta's massively popular "[[Deltalina]]" [[Pre-flight safety demonstration|inflight safety videos]]. The videos' theme was "Delta Safety First".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessatlanta.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/accessatlanta/peachbuzz/entries/2008/09/24/a_couple_of_atl.html "DELTALINA WAGS HER FINGER AT THE DOME", "Peach Buzz", ''Access Atlanta'' (''Atlanta Journal-Constitution''), September 24, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117094003/http://www.accessatlanta.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/accessatlanta/peachbuzz/entries/2008/09/24/a_couple_of_atl.html |date=January 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.delta.com/2008/09/26/delta-official-airline-of-the-atlanta-falcons/ "Delta, Official Airline of the Atlanta Falcons", Delta Air Lines, September 26, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313161340/http://blog.delta.com/2008/09/26/delta-official-airline-of-the-atlanta-falcons/ |date=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Le Defi Mark Ten International''' was one of the most prestigious [[Strength athletics|strongman]] contest in the world in the 1980s and early 1990s. Staged in Quebec, Canada, it was begun as a tribute to [[Louis Cyr]] and was notable for the quality of the strength athletes it attracted, which included a number of winners of the [[World's Strongest Man]] competition, including [[Jón Páll Sigmarsson]], [[Bill Kazmaier]] and [[Magnús Ver Magnússon]].

==History==
Live [[strength athletics]] competitions had begun in the late 1970s as a distinct set of disciplines from other strength related sports such as powerlifting or [[Highland Games]]. However, the associations of the new phenomena with its sporting forebears resulted in certain countries being at the vanguard of such competitions. One such country with a deep rooted past in strongman competition was Canada, and in particular [[Quebec]], referred to as a "cradle of strongmen".&lt;ref name="Sons"&gt;David Webster, ''Sons of Samson - Volume 2'', page 62, (Ironmind Enterprises Inc: Nevada City), {{ISBN|0-926888-06-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Jean-Claude Arsenault began to promote a competition named after the most famous of Quebec's strongmen of the past, [[Louis Cyr]]. The Louis Cyr Tournament was quickly a success and gained the sponsorship of a cigarette company resulting in its change of name to Defi Mark Ten.

The first outing of the competition caused some newspapers to claim that "Nationalism marred contest" citing the fact that Quebec was painted on the backdrop to the competition deliberately separate from Canada and grouped with France. Despite this, there was noted by the same newspaper an impressive camaraderie amongst the athletes.&lt;ref name="Sons"/&gt;

The event attracted the very top strength athletes in the world. Amongst these names were [[Bill Kazmaier]], [[Magnus Ver Magnusson]]  and [[Jon Pall Sigmarsson]]. The Canadian [[Tom Magee]] was the winner of the first three tournaments and the giant [[Mark Higgins (athlete)|Mark Higgins]] has been cited as the final winner before the sponsorship ran out in 1992.&lt;ref name="Sons"/&gt; A final contest was reportedly held two years later, with [[Raimundas Zenkevicius]] claiming that title although sources differ.&lt;ref name="Horne"/&gt; In 2008 a competition called [[Fortissimus]], founded by Paul Ohl, was staged in Canada which also claimed to be a tribute to the great Louis Cyr and was thus seen as the natural successor to the Defi Mark Ten International.

The ground has been the home of [[NK Maribor]] for every season since their formation on 12 December 1960, with the exception of two short periods in early 1961 during the construction of the new stands and early 2008, when the stadium underwent a major reconstruction.&lt;ref name=siol07092014&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.siol.net/sportal/nogomet/liga_prvakov/novice/2014/09/po_poteh_sportne_infrastrukture_20.aspx | title = Stanje je resno: Uefa komaj prižgala zeleno luč za Ljudski vrt |trans-title=The situation is serious: UEFA has barely given a green lLight for the Ljudski vrt | publisher = [[Siol]] | author = Rok Plestenjak |language=sl | date= 7 September 2014 | accessdate = 7 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opened in 1952, it was originally the home of [[NK Branik Maribor|Branik Maribor]], an association football club, which folded and was disbanded in 1960.&lt;ref name=vecer1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.vecer.com/portali/vecer/v1/default.asp?kaj=3&amp;id=2009050905431884 | title = Kratka zgodovina NK Maribor |trans-title=Short history of NK Maribor | publisher = [[Večer (Slovenia)|Večer]] | author = bze |language=sl | date = 9 May 2009 | accessdate = 5 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground has hosted 23 [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia internationals]] at senior level, the first in 1994 and the most recent in 2015. Ljudski vrt has hosted more [[Slovenian Football Cup]] finals than any other stadium, having hosted six matches in total. In addition, the stadium was one of the four venues, which hosted the [[2012 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]].

The area where the Ljudski vrt is situated was used for burial purpuses for centuries before it was first used for football in the early 1920s. Over the course of its history the stadium has gone through various stages of renovation and development, resulting in the current configuration. The record attendance at the stadium is 20,000, which was set in a match between Maribor and [[FK Proleter Zrenjanin|Proleter Zrenjanin]] in 1973. This record was set before the ground's conversion to an [[all-seater stadium]] in 1998; the changes, a result of [[UEFA]] safety regulations, include greatly reduced capacity. Notable feature of the stadium includes the main stand 129,8 meters long and 18,4 meters high concrete arch that is protected by the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage of Slovenia ({{lang-sl|Zavod za varstvo kulturne dediščine Slovenije}}) as an architectural and historical landmark.

Future plans for the Ljudski vrt include the construction of a nearby underground parking garage that would solve the current parking problems and the redevelopment of the outdated main stand, which was built in 1962 and has not received a major renovation since then.&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt; The stadium is a landmark of the city of Maribor and is considered as one of the most beautiful smaller stadium in the world.&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guyism.com/sports/stadiums-at-night-25-beautiful-cathedrals-of-sport.html |title=Stadiums at night: 25 beautiful cathedrals of sport |author=DC Scrap |date= |publisher=guyism.com |accessdate=28 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227192359/http://guyism.com/sports/stadiums-at-night-25-beautiful-cathedrals-of-sport.html |archivedate=27 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://onlineprosports.com/news/videos/Ljudski-Vrt-Stadium.html | title = Stadion Ljudski vrt | trans-title = Ljudski vrt stadium | author = OnlineProSports | date =  | publisher = onlineprosports.com | accessdate = 28 April 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area now known as Ljudski vrt was originally located outside of [[Maribor]]'s [[city walls]] and served as a [[cemetery]] for centuries.&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt; Around the year 1358 a small [[parish church]] with a cemetery was built and remained there until 1522 when it was abandoned,&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cemetery1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zpm-mb.si/attachments/sl/300/Dobravsko_pokopalisce.pdf | title = Dobravsko pokopališče | trans-title = Dobrava cemetery | publisher = zpm-mb.si | author = David Kramberger | language = sl | accessdate = 16 December 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120426053705/http://www.zpm-mb.si/attachments/sl/300/Dobravsko_pokopalisce.pdf | archivedate = 26 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish incursions]] being the most likely reason.&lt;ref name="Voje"&gt;{{cite book |author = Ignacij Voje |title = Slovenci pod pritiskom turškega nasilja |trans-title=Slovenes under pressure of Turkish violence |publisher = Znanstveni inštitut Filozofske fakultete |language= Slovenian |location=Ljubljana |year= 1996 |page= |isbn= 86-7207-083-6 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1571 the church was completely in [[ruins]]. The site served as a cemetery again between 1783 and 1914 when it was closed by a decision of the Maribor city council.&lt;ref name="cemetery1" /&gt; Some of the [[tomb]]s were allowed to be in use until 1937 when they were transferred to a new site.&lt;ref name="cemetery1" /&gt; In 1873 a tree park ({{lang-de|Volksgarten}}) was planted on the area from which Ljudski vrt received its present-day name.&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt; Around the start of the 20th century, Ljudski vrt was starting to become the recreational centre of the city and records from 1901 show that tennis was already being played there during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zveza-msdbranik.si/vsebina/1/26/Historia_Docet.html | title = Historia Docet | publisher = MŠD Branik |language=sl | accessdate = 26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], the whole area served as a [[shooting range]] for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]].&lt;ref name=Ljudski_vrt&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nkmaribor.com/Klub/Stadion/Zgodovina | title = Ljudski vrt: Zgodovina |trans-title=Ljudski vrt: History | publisher = [[NK Maribor]] official website |language=sl | accessdate = 30 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like in other Slovenian towns ([[Ljubljana]], [[Celje]], [[Trbovlje]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nzs.si/nzs/predstavitev-nzs/zgodovina | title = Zgodovina nogometa na Slovenskem |trans-title=History of football in Slovenia | publisher = [[Football Association of Slovenia]] |language=sl | accessdate = 16 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after World War I football boomed in Maribor with the establishment of new clubs, most notably [[I. SSK Maribor]] ({{lang-sl|1. Slovenski Športni Klub Maribor}}, {{lang-en|1. Slovene Sport Club Maribor}}), which was founded in 1919 by Slovenian youth.&lt;ref name=1.SSK&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zveza-msdbranik.si/vsebina/1/27/1919_-_1941.html | title = Prvi slovenski športni klub Maribor 1919 - 1941 |trans-title=First Slovene Sports Club Maribor 1919 - 1941 | publisher = MŠD Branik |language=sl | accessdate = 16 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[tennis]], football was one of the main sports departments of the club and in 1920 they received their first [[Association football pitch|football field]] at the Ljudski vrt area,&lt;ref name = "Ljudski_vrt"/&gt; which was erected with the help of local volunteers and prison [[convict]]s.&lt;ref name="1.SSK"/&gt;

After the [[World War II]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941, [[Maribor]] came under the occupation of [[Nazi Germany]] and the Nazi regime immediately disbanded all Slovene cultural and sports societies.&lt;ref name=okupacija&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zveza-msdbranik.si/vsebina/1/29/1941_-_1945.html | title = Okupacija in Narodnoosvobodilni boj 1941 - 1945 |trans-title=Occupation and national liberation struggle 1941 - 1945 | publisher = MŠD Branik |language=sl | accessdate = 7 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; I. SSK Maribor was particularly affected with dozens of arrests and deportations of their members.&lt;ref name="okupacija"/&gt; The club ceased all operations and many of their members joined in the fight for their fatherland and a total of 51 perished while fighting the [[Germans]].&lt;ref name="okupacija"/&gt; Those victims were later commemorated with the erection of a statue located on the northwestern corner of the stadium today.&lt;ref name="okupacija"/&gt; By the end of the war [[Maribor]] was the most destroyed larger town in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and the whole Ljudski vrt area was devastated, completely in ruins and without an organization which would renovate and later manage the sporting infrastructure at the site. On 29 January 1949, an initiative led to the establishment of [[NK Branik Maribor|Branik Maribor]] football club.&lt;ref name = branik1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zveza-msdbranik.si/vsebina/1/30/Po_2._svetovni_vojni.html | title = Obnova objektov in razvoj društva po drugi svetovni vojni |trans-title=Renovation of the facilities and the development of Society after WW2 | publisher = MŠD Branik |language=sl | accessdate = 5 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1951, they became the flagship of the new sport organization, MŠD Branik (''{{lang|sl|Mariborsko Športno Društvo Branik}}'').&lt;ref name=ustanovitev&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zveza-msdbranik.si/vsebina/1/32/Ustanovitev_mariborskega_športnega_društva_Branik.html | title = Ustanovitev mariborskega športnega društva Branik |trans-title=Foundation of Maribor Sports Society Branik | publisher = MŠD Branik |language=sl | accessdate = 17 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renovation and construction of the sports infrastructure at the Ljudski vrt and throughout Maribor was the primary objective of the new sports organization during most of the late 1940s and early 1950s and on 12 July 1952 the Ljudski vrt stadium was opened.&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vecer1/&gt;&lt;ref name=izgradnja&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zveza-msdbranik.si/vsebina/1/33/Izgradnja_šprotnih_objektov_po_letu_1945.html | title = Izgradnja šprotnih objektov po letu 1945 |trans-title=Construction of sports facilities after 1945 | publisher = MŠD Branik |language=sl | accessdate = 17 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the main pitch was fully enclosed by banking, surrounding the [[athletic track]], with concrete terraces and seats located on the western side.&lt;ref name="izgradnja"/&gt; By 1958 the concrete terraces, in length of 248 meters, were constructed throughout the banking around the pitch and served as the standing area for over 40 years.&lt;ref name="izgradnja"/&gt; Milan Černigoj was the main architect of the stadium and in the late 1950s he was joined by Boris Pipan with whom they designed a new main stand on the western side of the pitch.&lt;ref name="izgradnja"/&gt; The construction began in May 1960 and was completed in 1962, with the new club offices, dressing rooms and gyms located beneath it.&lt;ref name="izgradnja"/&gt; Notable feature of the stand includes 129,8 meters long and 18,4 meters high concrete arch that is protected by the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage of Slovenia (''{{lang|sl|Zavod za varstvo kulturne dediščine Slovenije}}'').&lt;ref name=zvkds&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zvkds.si/sl/kulturna-dediscina-slovenije/foto/6338-/ | title = Arhitektura 20. stoletja - Stadion Ljudski vrt | trans-title = Architecture of the 20th century - Ljudski vrt stadium | author = Miran Kambič | publisher = zvkds.si | language = sl | accessdate = 23 January 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120426054552/http://www.zvkds.si/sl/kulturna-dediscina-slovenije/foto/6338-/ | archivedate = 26 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary user of the stadium and the new club offices was to be NK Branik, however, the club was dissolved in 1960 due to a food poisoning affair.&lt;ref name="vecer1"/&gt; After that, the city of [[Maribor]] was left without an association football club that would play on a professional level, which was one of the reasons why NK Maribor was established on 12 December 1960.&lt;ref name="vecer1"/&gt; The new club found their home at Ljudski vrt and on 25 June 1961 they played their first match at the stadium, with the then main stand still under construction.&lt;ref name=tekma1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nkmaribor.com/dokument.asp?id=44 | title = Prva tekma NK Maribor v Ljudskem Vrtu |trans-title=NK Maribor's first match at the Ljudski vrt | author = NK Maribor | publisher = [[NK Maribor]] official website |language=sl |date = | accessdate = 29 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ljudski vrt was to remain in much the same state for another 30 years with no major developments until the early 1990s and the [[Ten-Day War|independence]] of [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref name="Ljudski_vrt"/&gt; After the opening of the main stand in 1962 the stadium's capacity increased to over 10,000. However, as most of the stadium had only concrete standing terraces it was possible to accommodate as much as 20,000 spectators during the club's important matches.&lt;ref name=Maribor_Proleter&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nkmaribor.com/dokument.asp?id=48 | title = Prva kvalifikacijska tekma za vstop v 1. ligo |trans-title=First qualifying match for promotion in the 1st league | publisher = nkmaribor.com |language=sl | accessdate = 23 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wooden benches on the main stand were replaced by plastic seats in 1994.&lt;ref name="Ljudski_vrt"/&gt; During the same year, on 24 August, the stadium received four [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlight]] pylons and the first football match at night was played in a [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] between [[NK Maribor]] and [[FC Norma Tallinn]]; won by Maribor 10–0.&lt;ref name="Ljudski_vrt"/&gt; The capacity of the stadium was greatly reduced four years later, as a result of [[UEFA]] safety regulations, with the ground's conversion to an [[all-seater stadium]].&lt;ref name="Ljudski_vrt"/&gt; During the [[1999–2000 UEFA Champions League|1999–2000 season]] Maribor became the first Slovenian club which qualified to the elite [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref name="Ljudski_vrt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mb_pohorje&gt;{{cite web | url = http://maribor-pohorje.si/football-club-maribor.aspx | title = Nogometni klub Maribor |trans-title=Football Club Maribor | author = Maribor Pohorje | date = | publisher = maribor-pohorje.si |language=sl | accessdate = 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the stadium received its first major redevelopment since 1962 with the renovation of the main stand's VIP box and dressing rooms and club offices beneath it.&lt;ref name="Ljudski_vrt"/&gt; The terraces ring opposite of the main stand was enlarged and the total capacity of the stadium was brought to 10,160 seats, making Ljudski vrt the [[List of football stadiums in Slovenia|largest football stadium in the country]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Ljudski_vrt"/&gt;

Maribor results in domestic and international competitions during the 1990s and their dedicated fanbase were the main reasons for political and sports officials in the city to start thinking about a new stadium. In 1996 the [[OFIS Architects]] Project Ring was selected with a plan to fully redevelop and modernise the stadium.&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt; The project included the refurbishment of the main stand and the surrounding area, removal of the athletic track and the concrete terraces on the northern, southern and eastern side of the pitch and their replacement with the brand new covered stands. In addition, the project also included new club offices, gym's, dressing rooms and commercial premises such as shops and bars located beneath the new stands. However, it would take nearly a decade for the project to become a reality when in 2006 the City of Maribor and MŠD Branik, with the help of the [[Government of Slovenia]] and the [[European Union]], finally amassed enough funds to start the first stage of the project.&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt;

The first stage of improvements, worth about 10 million [[euros]], saw the removal of the athletic track and the uncovered stands that surrounded the pitch from the north, east and south which were replaced by new covered stands, built only couple of meters from the pitch.&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt; Construction began in August 2006 and was finished by May 2008.&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt; One of the improvements included the replacement of the [[Association football pitch|turf]], which also included the installation of the [[Under-soil heating|underground heating system]], and during that time Maribor played couple of months at the [[Ptuj City Stadium]] in [[Ptuj]], about 30 kilometres from the city of Maribor.&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt; In addition, this was the first time that Maribor had played home matches outside of Ljudski vrt since the opening of the main stand in 1961.&lt;ref name="siol07092014"/&gt; The new stands, which increased the stadium capacity by over 2,000 seats, were opened on 10 May 2008 during a league match against [[NK Nafta Lendava|Nafta Lendava]]. The match was played in front of a sold-out crowd of 12,435 spectators and Maribor won 3–1. The second stage of the project started in 2010 and saw the completion of the premises under the eastern and southern stands. It included new club offices, dressing rooms and two [[gym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maribor.si/podrocje.aspx?id=1149|title=Potek investicije ŠTC - Ljudski vrt 2. faza|trans-title=Investment STV - Ljudski vrt 2. phase|publisher=maribor.si|accessdate=10 March 2016|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the total capacity of the stadium was brought to its present 12,702 seats.

In 2014, the stadium barely passed [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA stadium regulations]] for the international competitions due to aging west stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.siol.net/sportal/nogomet/liga_prvakov/novice/2014/09/po_poteh_sportne_infrastrukture_20.aspx|title=Stanje je resno: Uefa komaj prižgala zeleno luč za Ljudski vrt|trans-title=Condition is serious: Uefa barely turned on the green light for Ljudski vrt |publisher=[[Siol]]|author=Rok Plestenjak|date=7 September 2014|accessdate=10 March 2016|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the plans for re-developing of the west stand were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zurnal24.si/prenova-zahodne-tribune-lok-ostaja-clanek-255748|title=Prenova zahodne tribune, lok ostaja|trans-title=Renovation of the west stand, arch is staying|publisher=zurnal24.si|author=Ig.

==Football==
The stadium is mainly used for football and is the home ground of football club [[NK Maribor]]. It is the symbol of the club and one of the most recognizable sport landmarks in [[Slovenia]]. Beside being the home ground of NK Maribor, the stadium has also hosted final matches of the [[Slovenian Football Cup|Slovenian Cup]] and the [[Slovenian Supercup]] on numerous occasions. The ground is also occasionally used to host the home matches of [[Slovenia national football team]].

Maribor did not lose a league match at Ljudski vrt during the [[1960–61 Slovenian Republic League|1960–61]] (Div 3), 1965–66 (Div 2), 1966–67 (Div 2), [[1970–71 Yugoslav First League|1970–71]] (Div 1), 1972–73 (Div 2), 1977–78 (Div 2), [[1980–81 Yugoslav Second League|1980–81]] (Div 2), [[1981–82 Slovenian Republic League|1981–82]] (Div 3), [[1983–84 Slovenian Republic League|1983–84]] (Div 3), [[1985–86 Slovenian Republic League|1985–86]] (Div 3), [[Slovenian Republic League 1987-88|1987–88]] (Div 3), [[1991–92 Slovenian PrvaLiga|1991–92]] (Div 1), [[1992–93 Slovenian PrvaLiga|1992–93]] (Div 1), [[1998–99 Slovenian PrvaLiga|1998–99]] (Div 1) and [[1999–2000 Slovenian PrvaLiga|1999–2000]] (Div 1) season. They won all their home games during the 1983–84 and 1985–86 seasons. Maribor's longest winning streak at home extended from October 1993 to November 1994, a period encompassing 17 league games, in which Maribor scored 52 goals and conceded 10.

==Transport==
Ljudski vrt's public transport links include rail and bus services, but it lacks dedicated parking facilities. The stadium is about 1,5 [[kilometre]]s (1 [[mile]]) away from the Maribor bus station and the [[Maribor railway station]], which lies on the [[Pan-European Corridor Xa]] (connecting [[Zagreb]] to [[Graz]]) and on [[Pan-European Corridor V]], which connects [[Venice]] and [[Kiev]] ([[Ljubljana]] - [[Budapest]]). Several bus lines pass directly by the stadium with the nearest bus stations located less than one hundred meters from the ground. The connection to the [[A1 motorway (Slovenia)|A1 motorway]], that links to the [[Highways in Slovenia|Slovenian motorway network]], is located about 3 kilometres to the east, while [[Maribor Edvard Rusjan Airport]] is located about 13 kilometres to the southeast of the ground.

The sport of [[Australian rules football|Australian football]] has been called by a number of different names throughout its history; but since 1905, after the formation of the Australasian Football Council, the game has been officially called "Australian football"; and the name has been codified by the sport's governing body, the [[AFL Commission]], as the game's official name, in the "[[Laws of Australian football]]".&lt;ref name=OfficialName&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afl.com.au/afl-hq/the-afl-explained/about-the-afl |title=About the AFL: Australian Football (Official title of the code) |publisher=Australian Football League |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LawsoftheGame&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afl.com.au/afl-hq/laws-of-the-game |title=AFL Rules – Laws of the Game |publisher=Australian Football League |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the sport has been called "Victorian rules" (referring to its [[Origins of Australian rules football|origins]] in [[Melbourne]]), the "Victorian game", the "bouncing game", "Australasian rules", the "Australian game" and "national football", as well as several other names. Today, the common names for the sport are "Australian rules football" or "football", and common nicknames for the sport are "footy", "Aussie rules" or sometimes "AFL" (a [[Generic trademark|genericised abbreviation]] of [[Australian Football League]], the sport's largest competition and only fully professional league).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/name-of-the-game-is-up-in-the-air-in-nsw-20120321-1vkbw.html |title=Name of the game is up in the air in NSW |date=22 March 2012 |first=Rohan |last=Connolly |work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical names==
The first "Laws of Australian football" were established in [[Melbourne]] in 1859 by [[Tom Wills]] of the [[Melbourne Football Club]]. This led to the development of the terms "the Victorian Game" or "Victorian Rules",&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article19207993 THE VICTORIAN GAME.] – ''[[Brisbane Courier]]''. Published 27 July 1903. Retrieved from ''Trove'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; although in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the general term was just "football" as early as 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5682361 FOOTBALL. MELBOURNE V. RICHMOND] – ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]''. Published 14 May 1860. Retrieved from ''Trove'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1954, the term "Melbourne Rules" was being used by newspapers in [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]] to differentiate the game from other football codes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18513103 Melbourne Rules] – ''[[Sunday Herald (Australia)|Sunday Herald]]''. Published 21 September 1952. Retrieved from ''Trove'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50591500 Melbourne Rules] – ''[[The Courier-Mail]]''. Published 15 June 1954. Retrieved from ''Trove'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Another term was "the bouncing game", used mostly in [[Western Australia]] in the 1880s and 1890s to differentiate from the other codes, where bouncing was not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2986848 FOOTBALL RULES.] – ''[[The West Australian]]''. Published 16 May 1882. Retrieved from ''Trove'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Australian football" was in use outside of Victoria by the late 19th century. A variant of this, acknowledging the popularity of the sport in New Zealand, was "[[Australasia]]n football".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26339231 THE AUSTRALASIAN GAME.] – ''[[The West Australian]]''. Published 3 May 1911. Retrieved from ''Trove'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1908 [[1908 Melbourne Carnival|Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival]] featured a team from New Zealand, but the popularity of the sport declined there after World War I. In 1927, the Australasian Football Council changed its name to the Australian National Football Council, to acknowledge that the sport was no longer being played competitively in New Zealand. State leagues were encouraged to include the term "Australian National" in their title, with the South Australian Football League (SAFL) becoming the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL) in 1927, the [[Tasmanian Football League]] (TFL) becoming the Tasmanian Australian National Football League (TANFL) in 1928, and the West Australian Football League (WAFL) becoming the [[Western Australian National Football League]] (WANFL) in 1931. It was proposed that the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL) become the Victorian Australian National Football League; however, this did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article67766885 National Game.] – ''[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]]''. Published 9 August 1927. Retrieved from ''Trove'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several distinctions were made in the three major footballing states regarding the quality of play across different leagues. In Victoria, the [[Australian Football League|League]] football was considered superior to [[Victorian Football Association|Association]] football (not to be confused with [[association football|British association football]], also known as soccer); and for a time in the 1930s and 1940s, the distinction between the two competitions was necessary because they had sufficiently significant [[Australian rules football schism (1938–1949)|differences in rules]] that they were considered to be separate codes, similar to the distinction between [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne|title=Gallant win by W'Town|date=2 October 1939|page=13|author=Rover}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Australia, this distinction was also made between the [[West Australian Football League]] and the West Australian Football Association (formerly the 1st Rate Juniors competition), though the latter integrated into the WAFL reserves in 1921. There was also a distinction made in WA between the "coastal" (WAFL) and "'fields" ([[Goldfields Football League]]) leagues, who played each other regularly in the [[West Australian State Premiership|state premiership]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article24755479 COASTAL EIGHTEEN V. GOLDFIELDS] – ''[[The West Australian]]''. Published 23 July 1901. Retrieved from ''Trove'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, there was also a distinction made in most leagues between "senior" and "junior" football; this was not to do with age, rather with quality of play.

In December 1948, a controversy occurred when [[Enid Lyons|Dame Enid Lyons]], the [[Division of Darwin|Member for Darwin]], referred to Australian football as "our national game" in [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52657684 National Game] – ''[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]]''. Published 10 December 1948. Retrieved from ''Trove'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This was rebuffed by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] at the time, [[Ben Chifley]], a New South Welshman, who suggested Lyons was "treading on dangerous ground". The secretary of the ANFC, Percy Page, sent a telegram reading: "Congratulations on your stand.  The Prime Minister's obvious lack of knowledge of Australian sport is most regrettable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47630687 AUSTRALIA'S "NATIONAL" GAME UPHELD] – ''[[The West Australian]]''. Published 9 December 1948. Retrieved from ''Trove'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicknames==
The most common nicknames for the sport are "footy" and "Aussie rules". For much of the middle part of the 20th century, particularly in Canberra, the latter was shortened further to simply "Rules",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Good Neighbour|date=1 May 1950|page=6|title=Soccer, Rules or Rugby??? It's all football in Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this usage is now obsolete.

The term "AFL" (an abbreviation of Australian Football League) is sometimes used, particularly in areas where the game is not widely played and thus no one particular name for the sport is ingrained in the local population. The Australian Football League has encouraged competitions to include the term "AFL" in their name: the Queensland Football League changed its name to [[AFL Queensland]] in 1999, the New South Wales Australian Rules Football League changed its name to [[Sydney AFL]] in 1998, and the Australian Capital Territory Football League changed its name to [[AFL Canberra]] in 1999. [[Australian rules football around the world|Leagues outside of Australia]] also make use of this term. Most major [[newspapers in Australia]] use either "AFL" or "football" to refer to the sport.

The derogatory term "aerial ping-pong" is sometimes used mockingly by fans of other codes to refer to the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Richard-Hinds/An-old-favourite-aerial-pingpong-v-biff-and-barge/2005/03/25/1111692628869.html An old favourite: aerial ping-pong v biff and barge] – smh.com.au.

'''Nordic combined''' is a [[winter sport]] in which athletes compete in [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] and [[ski jumping]]. [[Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics]] and the [[FIS Nordic Combined World Cup]] are ongoing.

== History ==
The first major competition was held in 1892 in [[Oslo]] at the first [[Holmenkollen ski jump]]. [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V of Norway]] was an able jumper and competed in the Holmenkollen Ski Festival in the 1920s. It was in the [[1924 Winter Olympics]] and has been on the program ever since. Until the 1950s, the cross-country race was held first, followed by the ski jumping. This was reversed as the difference in the cross-country race tended to be too big to overcome in ski jumping. The sport has been dominated by the Norwegians, supported by the Finns. It was not until 1960 that the Nordic grip on this discipline was broken when [[West Germany|West German]] [[Georg Thoma]] won the gold medal at the [[Nordic combined at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=fis&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordic Combined Equipment and History|url=http://www.olympic.org/nordic-combined-equipment-and-history|publisher=FIS|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was decided in early-November 2016 that women's competitions were to be established on FIS-level starting during the second half of the 2010s with inclusion at world championships starting in 2021 and at the Olympic Winter Games in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fis-ski.com/news-multimedia/news/article=decisions-the-autumn-2016-fis-council-meeting-oberhofen-sui.html|title=Decisions of the Autumn 2016 FIS Council Meeting|publisher=International Ski Federation|language=English|date=5 November 2016|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Olympic debut for women in 2022 was cancelled by IOC in July 2018 who was asking more development time for this discipline and then likely been added in 2026. In May of 2018 the FIS Congress made several decisions regarding the inclusion of women in the sport of Nordic Combined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2018-19/article=fis-congress-historic-milestones-for-ladies-nordic-combined|title=FIS Congress: Historic steps for Nordic Combined Ladies|website=www.fis-ski.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  As of 2019, women will be officially included in FIS Junior World Championships. It was confirmed that 2021 will mark the start of the FIS World Championship program for women (senior level).  2018 marks the second year of the Continental Cup program for women, which will include a total of 12 events.

* Individual [[Gundersen method|Gundersen]]: competition starts with one competition jump from a normal or large hill. Later on the same day, the {{convert|10|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} cross-country race takes place. The winner starts at 00:00:00 and all other athletes start with time disadvantages according to their jumping score. The first to cross the finish line is the winner. A variation of this is the Final Individual Gundersen, consisting of two jumps and {{convert|15|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} of cross-country skiing in free technique.
*  Nordic Combined Triple: introduced in the [[2013–14 FIS Nordic Combined World Cup]], it features three different events on three days and one overall winner who is awarded extra World Cup points and prize money:
** Day 1: 1 jump &amp; {{convert|10|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} Prologue
** Day 2: 1 jump &amp; {{convert|15|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} Individual Gundersen (Top 50 from Day 1's competition)
** Day 3: 2 jumps &amp; {{convert|20|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} Final Individual Gundersen (Top 30 from Day 2's competition)
* Team Event: introduced in the 1980s, one team consists of four athletes who have one competition jump each. The total score of all four athletes determines the time disadvantages for the start of the ensuing {{convert|5|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} cross-country race. The first team to cross the finish line wins.
* Team Sprint: teams consist of two athletes each. In the ski jumping part, every athlete makes one competition jump like in the Individual Gundersen or Team Event formats and the time behind for the start of the successive cross-country race. The team to arrive first at the finish line wins the competition.

Included in the rules but currently not used in World Cup:
* Penalty Race: instead adding a time disadvantage, distance is added to the cross-country part.
* Mass Start: the only format in which the cross-country part takes place before the ski jumping. All competitors start into a {{convert|10|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} cross-country race in free technique at the same time. The final cross-country times are then converted into points for the ski jumping part. The winner is determined in a points-based system.

Events in the Olympics are: the sprint K120 individual, ski jumping K90 (70m), and Team/4x5km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordic Combined|url=http://www.olympic.org/nordic-combined|publisher=IOC|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
* [[Ski bindings]]: secure only the toe of the boot to the ski. In cross-country, it must be placed so that not more than 57% of the entire ski length is used as the front part. In jumping, a cord or aluminum post attaches the heel of the boot to the ski to prevent tips from dropping and/or wobbling of skis during flight.
* [[Ski boot]]
** For jumping, a high-backed, flexible yet firm boots with a low cut at the front, designed to allow the skier to lean forward during flight.
** For cross-country a skating boot is used.
* [[Ski suit]] and [[ski helmet|helmet]]
* [[Skis]]: jumping skis may have a length of a maximum 145% of the total body height of the competitor. Cross-country skis may be up to 2 meters long.
* [[Ski poles]] 
* [[Ski wax]]: glide wax for speed is used in both types, and kick wax is used in cross-country.&lt;ref name=fis/&gt;

[[File:Candlestick Park press box 1.JPG|thumb|Press box at [[Candlestick Park]].]]
[[File:Carter-Finley Stadium.jpg|thumb|200px|The massive press box at [[Carter–Finley Stadium]]]]

The '''press box''' is a special section of a [[sport]]s [[stadium]] or [[arena]] that is set up for the [[mass media|media]] to report about a given event.  It is typically located in the section of the stadium holding the [[luxury box]] and can be either enclosed or open to the elements. In general, newspaper writers sit in this box and write about the on-field event as it unfolds. Television and radio announcers [[Broadcasting of sports events|broadcast]] from the press box as well. Finally, in [[gridiron football]], some coaches (especially [[offensive coordinator]]s) prefer to work from the press box instead of from the sideline. For [[college basketball|college]] and [[professional basketball]], a "press row" along the sideline across the way from the scorer's table is setup instead for broadcasters and statisticians, while most writers work from a traditional press box position.

The press box is considered to be a working area, and writers, broadcasters, and other visitors to press boxes are constantly reminded of this fact at sporting events. Cheering is strictly forbidden in press boxes, and anyone violating rules against showing favoritism for either team is subject to ejection from the press box by security personnel. The rule against cheering is generally enforced only in the writers' area of the press box, and not against coaches and (in many cases) broadcasters who are known to be employed by one of the teams involved.

A "scratched" or injured [[ice hockey]] player can be said to be "watching from the press box".

'''Pye''' (first name and dates unknown) was an English [[cricket]]er who played for [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]] during the 1740s.

==Career==
In the 1747 and 1748 seasons, he was reported to have played in a total of three [[single wicket]] matches, all at the [[Artillery Ground]].  Two of these were "threes" matches in which he teamed up with [[Stephen Dingate]] and [[Joseph Rudd]], all of them being described as employees of the [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]] who patronised many of these contests.&lt;ref name=ASW&gt;[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], ''At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742-1751'', ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

As Pye had established his reputation by 1747, he must have been active for some years previously.  His career probably spanned the 1740s and 1750s when very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2155">'''W. Dennie Spry Soccer Stadium''' (usually called '''Spry Stadium''') is a [[soccer-specific stadium]] located on the campus of [[Wake Forest University]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] where it is home to the [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons soccer]] teams.

Opened in 1996, W. Dennie Spry Soccer Stadium is home to the Wake Forest men's and women's soccer programs. Considered one of the top soccer facilities in the country, the 3,000-seat stadium is considered a jewel in Wake Forest's family of athletic facilities and gives the Demon Deacons a true home field advantage.
 
The Spry Stadium complex features a fully lit natural grass playing field along with two lit natural grass practice fields. The facility also includes a state-of-the-art scoreboard and sound system, locker rooms for both the men's and women's teams, a pressbox with rooftop observation deck and concession stands.
The Deacons regularly play in front of packed crowds, as the campus and local communities support the men's and women's teams. A strong contingent of students can always be found on the hill overlooking the north side of the stadium.

Spry Stadium has hosted several major soccer events. The ACC Tournament has been contested four times at Spry: the women's tournament was held there in 1997, while the men's event was held at the venue for three straight years from 1998 to 2000.

In March 2001, Spry Stadium hosted a Major League Soccer exhibition match between the Miami Fusion and D.C. United and an exhibition match between Wake Forest and the United States U-17 National Team.

A '''wetsuit''' is a garment, usually made of foamed [[neoprene]], which is worn by [[surfing|surfers]], [[Underwater diving|diver]]s, [[windsurfers]], [[canoeists]], and others engaged in [[water sports]] and other activities in or on water, primarily providing [[thermal insulation]], but also [[buoyancy]] and protection from [[abrasion (medical)|abrasion]], ultraviolet exposure and stings from marine organisms. The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to [[Conduction (heat)|conduct heat]]. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low [[density]], providing buoyancy in water.

[[Hugh Bradner]], a [[University of California, Berkeley]], physicist invented the modern wetsuit in 1952. Wetsuits became available in the mid-1950s and evolved as the relatively fragile foamed neoprene was first backed, and later sandwiched, with thin sheets of tougher material such as nylon or later [[Spandex|Lycra/Spandex]]. Improvements in the way joints in the wetsuit were made by gluing, taping and blindstitching, helped the suit to remain waterproof and reduce ''flushing'', the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside.&lt;ref name=wetsuitswork /&gt; Further improvements in the seals at the neck, wrists, ankles and zippers produced a suit known as a "semi-dry".

Different types of wetsuit are made for different uses and for different temperatures.&lt;ref name=Williams2003 /&gt; Suits range from a thin (2&amp;nbsp;mm or less) "shortie", covering just the torso, to a full 8&amp;nbsp;mm semi-dry, usually complemented by neoprene boots, gloves and hood.

The difference between a wetsuit and a [[dry suit]] is that a wetsuit allows water to enter the suit, while dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering, thus keeping the undergarments dry and preserving their insulating effectiveness.  Wetsuits can give adequate protection in warm to moderately cold waters. Dry suits are typically more expensive and more complex to don but can be used where protection from low temperatures or contaminated water is needed.&lt;ref name=Barsky /&gt;

==Uses==
Wetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water, or frequently doused with heavy spray, often approaching from near-horizontal directions, where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out.
Activities include [[underwater diving]], [[sailing]], [[Lifeboat (rescue)|sea rescue]] operations, [[surfing]], [[river rafting]], [[whitewater kayaking]] and in some circumstances, endurance swimming.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[open water swimming]] events the use of wetsuits is controversial, as some participants claim{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} that wetsuits are being worn for competitive advantage and not just for warmth.&lt;ref name="Kent" /&gt;

Unlike [[triathlons]], which allow swimmers to wear wetsuits when the water is below a certain temperature (the standard is {{convert|78|°F|°C}} at the surface or up to {{convert|84|°F|°C}} for unofficial events.&lt;ref name="Triathlon temperaturs" /&gt;), most open water swim races either do not permit the use of wetsuits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onetomulti.com/2017/10/10/kona-ironman-world-championship-all-you-need-to-know/|title=Kona Ironman World Championship - All You Need To Know - One To Multi|author=|date=October 10, 2017|website=onetomulti.com|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (usually defined as anything covering the body above the waist or below the knees), or put wetsuit-clad swimmers in a separate category and/or make them ineligible for race awards.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} This varies by locales and times of the year, where water temperatures are substantially below comfortable.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}

==Insulation==
[[File:MutaSemistagnaCaviglia.jpg |thumb|alt=the cuff of a semi-dry suit, showing an inner and outer seal |Semi-dry cuffs use a smooth surface to seal against the skin to reduce flushing.]]
Still water (without currents or [[convection]]) conducts heat away from the body by pure [[Temperature gradient|thermal diffusion]], approximately 20 to 25 times more efficiently than still air.&lt;ref name=Williams2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tucker and Dugas 2008" /&gt; Water has a thermal conductivity of 0.58&amp;nbsp;Wm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; while still air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024&amp;nbsp;Wm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name="engtbox" /&gt; so an unprotected person can succumb to [[hypothermia]] even in warmish water on a warm day.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; Wetsuits are made of closed-cell foam [[neoprene]], a [[synthetic rubber]] that contains small bubbles of [[nitrogen]] gas when made for use as wetsuit material (neoprene may also be manufactured without foaming for many other applications where insulating qualities are not important). Nitrogen, like most gases, has very low [[thermal conductivity]] compared to water or to solids,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Nitrogen has a thermal conductivity of 0.024&amp;nbsp;Wm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the same as air – {{cite web |url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html |title=Thermal conductivity of some common materials |year=2005 |publisher=The Engineering ToolBox |accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the small and enclosed nature of the gas bubbles minimizes heat transport through the gas by convection in the same way that cloth fabrics or feathers insulate by reducing convection of enclosed air spaces. The result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction, which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas, thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body (or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit.

Uncompressed foam neoprene has a typical thermal conductivity in the region of 0.054&amp;nbsp;Wm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which produces about twice the heat loss of still air, or one-tenth the loss of water. However at a depth of about {{convert|15|m|ft|-1}} of water, the thickness of the neoprene will be halved and its conductivity will be increased by about 50%, allowing heat to be lost at three times the rate at the surface.&lt;ref name="Bardy2005" /&gt;

A wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed; too loose a fit, particularly at the openings (wrists, ankles, neck and overlaps) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves.&lt;ref name=wetsuitswork/&gt; Flexible seals at the suit cuffs aid in preventing heat loss in this fashion. The elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes, but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety.

Foamed neoprene is very buoyant, helping swimmers to stay afloat, and for this reason divers need to carry [[Diving weighting system|extra weight]] based on the volume of their suit to achieve neutral [[buoyancy]] near the surface.&lt;ref name=Williams2003/&gt; However, the suit loses thermal protection as the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed at depth&lt;ref name=Monji1989 /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Non-foamed solid neoprene has a thermal conductivity between 0.15&amp;nbsp;Wm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.45&amp;nbsp;Wm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; depending on type, not very different from water – {{cite web |url=http://physics.info/conduction/ |title=Conduction |first=Glenn |last=Elert |year=2008 |work=The Physics Hypertextbook |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buoyancy is also reduced by compression, and scuba divers cancorrect this  by inflating the [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|buoyancy compensator]].

=== Semi-dry suits ===
[[File:MutaSemistagnaCernieraFodera.jpg|thumb|alt=Detail of the zipper of a semi-dry wetsuit, showing one end of an open zipper and the neoprene flaps that cover it on the inside and outside of the suit to protect the zipper, improve comfort, and reduce leakage through the closed zip.|Detail showing zipper attachment, internal flap and cover flap of semi-dry suit]]&lt;!--illustrates a detail described in the text quite well--&gt;
Semi-dry suits are effectively a wetsuit with reasonably effective seals at wrist, neck, ankles and zipper. The seals limit the amount of water entering and leaving the suit when the wearer moves in the water. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and does not leave the suit readily, so the wearer remains warm. The trapped layer of water does not add significantly to the suit's insulating ability. Any residual water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss. Semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits. They are usually made from thick Neoprene, which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the Neoprene compress at depth. Semi-dry suits can come in various configurations including a one-piece full-body suit or two pieces, made of 'long johns' and a separate 'jacket'.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--for two-piece semi-dry suits--&gt; The zipper is commonly across the shoulders on the back, but other arrangements have been used. Semi dry suits do not usually include boots, so a separate pair of wetsuit boots are worn. They are most suitable for use where the water temperature is between {{convert|10|and|20|C|F}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--for temperature range--&gt;

===Heated suits===
Electrically heated wetsuits are also available on the market. These suits have special heating panels integrated in the back of the wetsuit. The power for heating comes from batteries also integrated into the wetsuit.&lt;ref name=Leckart2010&gt;{{cite web |author=Leckart, Steven |title=Rip Curl H-Bomb: Heated Wetsuit Stokes Your Fanny When Hanging 10 |publisher=Wired (website) |date=2010-04-15 |url=https://www.wired.com/reviews/2010/04/pr_ripcurl_hbomb/ |accessdate=2013-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more versatile is the heated neoprene vest that functions the same as the heated wetsuit but can be worn under any type of wetsuit.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Wetsuits heated by a flow of hot water piped from the surface are standard equipment for commercial diving in cold water, particularly where the heat loss from the diver is increased by use of helium based breathing gases.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bevan, John|title=The Professional Divers's Handbook|edition=second|year=2005|publisher=Submex Ltd|location=5 Nepean Close, Alverstoke, GOSPORT, Hampshire PO12 2BH |isbn= 978-0950824260|page=242|chapter=Section 5.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hot water suits are a loose fit as there is a constant supply of heated water piped into the suit which must escape to allow even flow distribution. Flushing with cold water is prevented by the constant outflow of heating water.

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Smoothskin beavertail wetsuit.jpg|thumb|Woman wearing "smoothskin" wetsuit with "beavertail" and twistlock fasteners]]
{{See also|Diving suit}}
In 1952, [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] and subsequent [[UC San Diego]] [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography|SIO]] [[physicist]] [[Hugh Bradner]], who is considered to be the original inventor&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; and "father of the modern wetsuit,"&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; had the insight that a thin layer of trapped water could be tolerated between the suit fabric and the skin, so long as insulation was present in the fabric in the form of trapped bubbles. In this case, the water would quickly reach skin temperature and the air in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way. In the popular mind, the layer of water between skin and suit has been credited with providing the insulation. But as his letter notes,{{clarify|reason=what letter?|date=November 2018}} Bradner clearly understood the suit did not need to be wet because it isn't the water that provides the insulation but rather the gas in the suit fabric.&lt;ref name=sfc /&gt;&lt;ref name=times /&gt; He initially sent his ideas to Lauriston C. "Larry" Marshall who was involved in a U.S. Navy/National Research Council Panel on Underwater Swimmers.&lt;ref name=Rainey /&gt; However, it was [[Willard Bascom]], an engineer at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in [[La Jolla, California]], who suggested neoprene as a feasible material to Bradner.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

However, Bradner and Bascom were not overly interested in profiting from their design and were unable to successfully market a version to the public.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; They attempted to patent their neoprene wetsuit design, but their application was rejected because the design was viewed as too similar to a [[flight suit]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; The [[United States Navy]] also turned down Bradner's and Bascom's offer to supply its swimmers and frogmen with the new wetsuits due to concerns that the gas in the neoprene component of the suits might make it easier for naval divers to be detected by underwater [[sonar]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; The first written documentation of Bradner's invention was in a letter to Marshall, dated June 21, 1951.&lt;ref name=Rainey/&gt;

[[Jack O'Neill (businessman)|Jack O'Neill]] started using closed-cell neoprene foam which was shown to him by his bodysurfing friend, Harry Hind, who knew of it as an insulating material in his laboratory work.{{citation needed|date=May 2010|reason=this text replaced differing content, albeit weakly sourced}} After experimenting with the material and finding it superior to other insulating foams, O'Neill founded the successful wetsuit manufacturing company called [[O'Neill (brand)|''O'Neill'']] in a garage in 1952, later relocating to Santa Cruz, California&lt;ref name=santacruzwetsuits /&gt; in 1959 with the motto "It's Always Summer on the Inside".&lt;ref name="surfline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Neill" /&gt; Bob and [[Bill Meistrell]], from [[Manhattan Beach, California]], also started experimenting with [[neoprene]] around 1953. They started a company which would later be named [[Body Glove]].

Neoprene was not the only material used in early wetsuits, particularly in Europe. The French-made Pêche-Sport Suit and the UK-made [[Siebe Gorman]] Swimsuit were both made out of sponge rubber. The [[Heinke (diving equipment makers)|Heinke]] Dolphin Suit of the same period, also made in England, came in a green male and a white female version, both manufactured from natural rubber lined with stockinet.

==Development of suit design==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
Originally, wetsuits were made only with raw sheets of foam-rubber neoprene that did not have any backing material. This type of suit required extra caution while pulling it on because the raw foam-rubber by itself is both fragile and sticky against bare skin. Stretching and pulling excessively easily caused these suits to be torn in half. This was somewhat remedied by thoroughly powdering the suit and the diver's body with [[talc]] to help the rubber slide on more easily.

Backing materials first arrived in the form of nylon sheeting applied to one side of the neoprene. This allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the tough nylon took most of the strain of pulling on the suit, but the suit still had the black sheet rubber exposed on the outside and the nylon was very stiff and rigid, limiting flexibility. A small strip reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck, wrists, and ankles.

In the early 1960s, the British Dunlop Sports Company brought out its yellow Aquafort neoprene wetsuit, whose high visibility was designed to improve diver safety. However, the line was discontinued after a short while and wetsuits reverted to their black uniformity. The colorful wetsuits seen today first arrived in the 1970s when double-backed neoprene was developed. In this material the foam-rubber is sandwiched between two protective fabric outer layers, greatly increasing the tear-resistance. An external layer also meant that decorative colors, logos, and patterns could be made with panels and strips sewn into various shapes. This change from bare flat black rubber to full color took off in the 1980s with brilliant fluorescent colors common on many suits.

===Improvements in suit assembly===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
The first suits used traditional sewing methods to simply overlap two strips of rubber and sew them together. In a rubber wetsuit this does not work well for a number of reasons, the main one being that punching holes straight through both layers of foam for the thread opens up passages for water to flow in and out of the suit. The second problem is that the stretching of the foam tended to enlarge the needle holes when the suit was worn. This meant that a wetsuit could be very cold all along the seams of the suit. And although the sewn edge did hold the two pieces together, it could also act as a [[perforation|perforated]] tear edge, making the suit easier to tear along the seams when putting it on and taking it off.

When nylon-backed neoprene appeared, the problem of the needle weakening the foam was solved, but still the needle holes leaked water along the seams.

====Seam taping====
To deal with all these early sewing problems, taping of seams was developed. The tape is a strong nylon cloth with a very thin but solid waterproof rubber backing. The tape is applied across the seam and bonded either with a [[chemical solvent]] or with a hot rolling heat-sealer to melt the tape into the neoprene.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

With this technology, the suit could be sewn and then taped, and the tape would cover the sewing holes as well as providing some extra strength to prevent tearing along the needle holes.

When colorful double-backed designer suits started appearing, taping moved primarily to the inside of the suit because the tape was usually very wide, jagged, black, and ugly, and was hidden within the suit and out of sight.

Many 1960s and 1970s wetsuits were black with visible yellow seam taping. The yellow made the divers more easily seen in dark low-visibility water. To avoid this problem{{clarify|reason=which problem?|date=November 2018}} O'Neill fabricators developed a seam-tape which combined a thin nylon layer with a polyester hemming tape. Applied over the interior of the glued &amp; sewn seam, then anneal bonded with a hand held teflon heating iron produced a seam that was both securely sealed and much stronger.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

====Seam gluing====
Another alternative to sewing was to glue the edges of the suit together. This created a smooth, flat surface that did not necessarily need taping, but unfortunately raw foam glued to foam is not a strong bond and still prone to tearing.

Most early wetsuits were fabricated completely by hand, which could lead to sizing errors in the cutting of the foam sheeting. If the cut edges did not align correctly or the gluing was not done well, there might still be water leakage along the seam.

Initially suits could be found as being sewn only, glued only, taped only, then also sewn and taped, or glued and taped, or perhaps all three.

====Blindstitch revolution====
Sometime after nylon-backed neoprene appeared, the [[Overlock|blind stitch]] method was developed. A blindstitch sewing machine uses a curved needle, which does not go all the way through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the fabric backing, crosses the glue line, and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene.&lt;ref name=wetsuitswork/&gt; This is similar to the [[overlock]] stitching used for teeshirts and other garments made from knitted fabrics.

The curved needle allows the fabric backing to be sewn together without punching a hole completely through the neoprene, and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam. Blindstitch seams also lay flat, butting up the edge of one sheet against another, allowing the material to lay flatter and closer to the skin. For these reasons blindstitching rapidly became the primary method of sewing wetsuits together, with other methods now used mainly for [[decorative]] or [[Fashion|stylistic]] purposes.

===Further advances in suit design===
Highly [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] fabrics such as [[Spandex|Lycra/Spandex]] have mostly replaced raw nylon backing, since the nylon by itself cannot be stretched and makes the neoprene very stiff. Incorporating Lycra into the backing permits a large amount of stretching that does not damage the suit, and allowed suits to become closer fitting.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

After the development of double-backed neoprene, singled-backed neoprene still had its uses for various specific purposes. For example, a thin strip of single-backed wrapped around the leg, neck, and wrist openings of the suit creates a seal that greatly reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit as the person's body moves. But since the strip is very narrow, it does not drag on the skin of the wearer and thus makes the suit easy to put on and remove. The strip can also be fitted with the smooth side out and folded under to form a seal with a small length of smooth surface against the skin.

As wetsuit manufacturers continued to design suits, they found ways that the materials could be further optimized and customized. The O'Neill Animal Skin  created in 1974 by then Director of Marketing,  E.J. Armstrong,  was one of the first designs combining a turtle-neck based on the popular Sealsuit  with a flexible lightweight YKK horizontal zipper across the back shoulders similar in concept to the inflatable watertight Supersuit ( developed by [[Jack O'Neill (businessman)|Jack O'Neill]] in the late 1960s ). The Animal Skin eventually evolved molded rubber patterns bonded onto the exterior of the neoprene sheeting ( a technique E.J. Armstrong perfected for application of the moulded raised rubber Supersuit logo to replace the standard flat decals ). This has been carried on as stylized reinforcing pads of rubber on the knees and elbows to protect the suit from wear, and allows logos to be directly bonded onto raw sheet rubber. Additionally, the Animal Skin's looser fit allowed for the use of a supplemental vest in extreme conditions.

In the early 1970s [[Gul (watersports)|Gul Wetsuits]] pioneered the one-piece wetsuit named as the steamer. Its name was given because of the steam given off from the suit once taken off allowing heat and water held inside to escape. Today one-piece wetsuits are still sometimes referred to as 'Steamers'.&lt;ref name="Gul" /&gt;

In recent years, manufacturers have experimented by combining various materials with neoprene for additional warmth or flexibility of their suits. These include, but are not limited to, [[Spandex]], and [[wool]].

Precision [[Computer Aided Manufacturing|computer-controlled]] cutting and assembly methods, such as [[Water jet cutter|water-jet cutting]], have allowed ever greater levels of seam precision, permitting designers to use many small individual strips of different colors while still keeping the suit free of bulging and ripples from improper cutting and sewing. Further innovations in CAD (Computer Aided Design) technology allow precision cutting for custom-fit wetsuits.

===Return of single-backed neoprene===
As wetsuits continued to evolve, their use was explored in other sports such as open-water swimming and [[triathlons]]. Although double-backed neoprene is strong, the cloth surface is relatively rough and creates a large amount of [[Fluid resistance|drag]] in the water, slowing down the swimmer. A single-backed suit has a [[hydrodynamics|smoother exterior surface which causes less drag]].&lt;ref name=wetsuitswork/&gt; With the advances of elastic Lycra backings and blindstitching, single-backed neoprene suits could be made that outperformed the early versions from the 1970s. Other developments in single-backed wetsuits include the suits designed for [[free-diving]] and [[spearfishing]]. Single lined neoprene is more flexible than double lined. To achieve flexibility and low bulk for a given warmth of suit, they are unlined inside, and the slightly porous raw surface of the neoprene adheres closely to the skin and reduces flushing of the suit. The lined outer surface may be printed with [[camouflage]] patterns for spearfishing and is more resistant to damage while in use.&lt;ref name="Ninepin 2016" /&gt;

Some triathlon wetsuits go further, and use rubber-molding and texturing methods to roughen up the surface of the suit on the forearms, to increase forward drag and help pull the swimmer forwards through the water. Extremely thin 1&amp;nbsp;mm neoprene is also often used in the under-arm area, to decrease stretch resistance and reduce strain on the swimmer when they extend their arms out over their head.

Wetsuits used for [[caving]] are often single-backed with a textured surface known as "sharkskin" which is a thin layer where the neoprene is less expanded. This makes it more [[Wear#Abrasive wear|abrasion]] resistant for squeezing between rocks and doesn't get torn in the way that fabric does.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Another reason to eliminate the external textile backing is to reduce water retention which can increase [[evaporative cooling]] and [[wind chill]] in suits used mainly out of the water.&lt;ref name="Ninepin 2016" /&gt;

* A sleeveless '''vest''', covering only the torso, provides minimal coverage. Some include an attached hood. These are not usually intended to be worn alone, but as an extra layer over or under a longer wetsuit.
* A hooded tunic, covering the torso and head, with short legs and either short or no sleeves, is generally intended to be worn over a full suit, and has a zip closure. It may be fitted with pockets for transporting accessories.
* A '''jacket''' covers the torso and arms, with little to no coverage for the legs. Some jackets have short legs like a shorty, others feature leg holes similar to a woman's [[swimsuit]]. A third style, the '''beavertail''' or [[bodysuit]], has a flap which passes through the crotch and attaches at the front with clips, toggles or velcro [[fastener]]s.  It is worn with (over) or without a long john or trousers. A jacket may include an integral hood, and may have a full or partial front zipper.
* A '''spring suit'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;!--for spring suit--&gt; covers the torso and has short or long sleeves and short legs.
* '''[[Trousers]]''' cover the lower torso and legs.
* A '''short john''', '''shorty''' covers the torso and legs to the knee only; does not have sleeves and is a short legged version of the long john.
* A '''long john''', '''johnny''', '''johnny suit''', or '''farmer john/jane''' (depending on the gender the suit is designed for) covers the torso and legs only; it resembles a [[bib overall]], hence the nickname.
* A '''full suit''' or '''steamer'''&lt;ref name="steamer" /&gt; covers the torso and the full length of the arms and legs. Some versions come with sleeves the length of a standard t-shirt and known as a short-sleeved steamer.

Some suits are arranged in two parts; the jacket and long johns can be worn separately in mild conditions or worn together to provide two layers of insulation around the torso in cold conditions. Typically, two-piece cold water wetsuits have 10 to 14&amp;nbsp;mm of material around the torso and 5 to 7&amp;nbsp;mm for the extremities.

===Thickness===
Wetsuits are available in different thicknesses depending on the conditions for which they are intended.&lt;ref name=Williams2003/&gt; The thicker the suit, the warmer it will keep the wearer, but the more it will restrict movement. Because wetsuits offer significant protection from [[jellyfish]], [[coral]], sunburn and other hazards, many divers opt to wear a thin suit which provides minimal insulation (often called a "[[bodysuit]]") even when the water is warm enough to comfortably forego insulating garments.&lt;ref name=Williams2003/&gt; A thick suit will restrict mobility, and as the thickness is increased the suit may become impractical, depending on the application. This is one reason why [[dry suit]]s may be preferable for some applications. A wetsuit is normally specified in terms of its [[wikt:thickness|thickness]] and style. For instance, a wetsuit with a [[torso]] thickness of 5&amp;nbsp;mm and a [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] thickness of 3&amp;nbsp;mm will be described as a "5/3". With new technologies the neoprene is getting more flexible. Modern 4/3 wetsuits, for instance, may feel as flexible as a 3/2 of only a few years ago. Some suits have extra layers added for key areas such as the lower back. Improved flexibility may come at the cost of greater compressibility, which reduces insulation at depth, but this is only important for diving.

===Surface finish===
Foam neoprene used for wetsuits is always closed cell, in that the gas bubbles are mostly not connected to each other inside the neoprene. This is necessary to prevent water absorption, and the gas bubbles do most of the insulation. Thick sheets of neoprene are foamed inside a mould, and the surfaces in contact with the mould take on the inverse texture of the mould surfaces. In the early days of wetsuits this was often a diamond pattern or similar, but can also be slick and smooth for low drag and quick drying. The cut surfaces of the foam have a slightly porous mat finish as the cutting process passes through a large number of bubbles, leaving what is called an open cell surface finish, but the bulk of the foam remains closed cell. The open cell finish is the most stretchy and the least tear resistant. It is relatively form fitting and comfortable on the skin, but the porosity encourages bacterial growth if not well washed after use, and the foam surface does not slide freely against skin.&lt;ref name="Ninepin 2016" /&gt;

The cut surfaces are usually bonded to a nylon knit fabric, which provides much greater tear resistance, at the expense of some loss of flexibility. This fabric can be bonded to one or both surfaces in various combinations of weight and colour, and can be thin and relatively smooth and fragile, or thicker and stronger and less stretchy. Fabric lined on one side only is more flexible than double lined.&lt;ref name="Ninepin 2016" /&gt;

A specialized kind of wetsuit, with a very smooth (and somewhat delicate) outer surface known as ''smoothskin'', which is the original outer surface of the foamed neoprene block from which the sheets are cut, is used for long distance swimming, triathlon competitive apnoea and bluewater spearfishing. These are designed to maximize the mobility of the limbs while providing both warmth and buoyancy, but the surface is delicate and easily damaged. The slick surface also dries quickly and is least affected by wind chill when out of the water.&lt;ref name=wetsuitswork/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ninepin 2016" /&gt;

Both smoothskin and fabric lined surfaces can be printed to produce colour patterns such as camouflage designs, which may give spearfishermen and combat divers an advantage.&lt;ref name="Ninepin 2016" /&gt;

===Closures===
Zippers are often used for closure or for providing a close fit at the wrists and ankles, but they also provide leakage points for water. 
Jackets may have a full or partial front zipper, or none at all. Full body suits may have a vertical back zipper, a cross-shoulder zipper or a vertical front zipper. Each of these arrangements has some advantages and some disadvantages: 
*The front zipper is easy to operate, but the suit may be difficult to remove from the shoulders without assistance, and the zip is uncomfortable for lying on a surfboard. It is relatively inflexible and placed over a part of the body where a lot of flexibility is desirable. The top of the closure will leak to some extent. The top end of the zip may be easily opened for comfort when the wearer is warm, but the zip may also press into the throat, which can be uncomfortable.
*Cross shoulder zipper can be made relatively watertight as it has no free ends, and is therefore used in semi-dry wetsuits. It is difficult to operate for the wearer and relatively highly stressed at the shoulders due to arm movement. The zip is also relatively vulnerable to damage from diving harnesses.
*Cross chest zipper has similar advantages to cross shoulder, but is easy to reach.
*Vertical back zippers are possibly the most common arrangement as they can be operated with a lanyard. They are relatively comfortable for most applications, the suit is easy to remove, and they place the zipper directly over the spine, which though flexible in bending, does not change much in length. The top of the closure will leak to some extent.

===Sizing and fit===

Wetsuits that fit too tightly can cause difficulty breathing or even [[Heart failure|acute cardiac failure]],&lt;ref name=Williams2003/&gt; and a loose fit allows considerable flushing which reduces effectiveness of insulation, so a proper fit is important. The quality of fit is most important for diving as this is where the thickest suits are used and the heat loss is potentially greatest. A diving wetsuit should touch the skin over as much of the body that it covers as comfortably possible, both when the wearer is relaxed and when exercising. This is difficult to achieve and the details of style and cut can affect the quality of fit. Gaps where the suit does not touch the skin will vary in volume as the diver moves and this is a major cause of flushing.

Wetsuits are made in several standard adult sizes and for children. Custom fitted suits are produced by many manufacturers to provide a better fit for people for whom a well fitting off-the shelf suit is not available.

==Accessories==

Usually a wetsuit has no covering for the feet, hands or head, and the diver must wear separate neoprene [[Wetsuit boot|booties]], gloves and hood for additional insulation and environmental protection.  Other accessories to the basic suit include pockets for holding small items and equipment, and knee-pads, to protect the knee area from abrasion and tearing, usually used by working divers. Suits may have abrasion protection pads in other areas depending on the application.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Hoods===
Using '''hoods''': in the [[human body temperature|thermal balance of the human body]], the heat loss over the head is at least 20% of the whole balance{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}. Thus, for the sake of thermal protection of the diver, wearing a well-fitting hood is useful, even at fairly moderate water temperatures. Hoods have been reported to cause [[claustrophobia]]&lt;ref name=Williams2003/&gt; in a minority of users, sometimes due to poor fit. The hood should not fit too tightly round the neck. Flushing in the neck area can be reduced by using a hood attached to the top part of the suit, or by having sufficient overlap between the hood and the top part of the suit to constrain flow between the two parts. This can be achieved by tucking a circular flap at the base of the neck of the hood under the top of the suit before closing the zip, or by having a high neck on the suit.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Boots===
[[Image:WetsuitBootPair.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of zippered wetsuit boots. Note the reinforced sole for protection.]]
Wetsuit boots are worn for various purposes, and may be worn with or without a wetsuit.

====Thermal protection====
In many water sports such as [[scuba diving]], [[surfing]], [[kayaking]], [[windsurfing]], [[sailing]] and even [[fishing]], bootees may be worn to keep the feet warm in the same way that a wetsuit would. Insulation is proportional to thickness and thus to how cold the water which the user can tolerate; it may be above or below the standard of 5–6&amp;nbsp;mm of [[neoprene]]. In warmer climates where the thermal qualities of the bootee are not so important, a bootee with a thickness of 2-3.5&amp;nbsp;mm is common. The leg of the bootee may have a [[zipper]] down one side or may be tightened with a [[velcro]] strap. Where boots are worn with a wetsuit they are usually tucked under the leg of the suit for streamlining, to help hold the zip closed, and to keep foreign objects out.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

====Foot protection====
A bootee usually has a reinforced [[Sole (shoe)|sole]] for walking. Typically, this is a solid rubber compound that is thicker and tougher than the neoprene used for the upper part of the bootee but is still flexible. The reinforced sole provides the wearer with some protection and grip when walking across shingle, coral and other rough surfaces.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===For scuba diving===
For [[scuba diving]] the sole of the bootee should not be so thick that the diver cannot get a [[swimfin|fin]] on over it. Divers wearing bootees use fins with a foot part larger than needed with bare feet. Divers in warm water who do not wear a diving suit sometimes wear bootees so they can wear bigger fins. Diving bootees are typically intended for wear with open-heeled fins, held on by a strap, and usually do not fit into full-footed fins. Neoprene socks may be used with full-footed fins, either to prevent chafing and blisters, or for warmth.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

====For surfing====
For [[surfing]], [[windsurfing]], [[kitesurfing]] and similar sports, bootees are typically worn where the weather is so cold that the surfer would lose some degree of functionality in the feet. The bootee should not restrict the ability of a surfer to grip the board with the toes in the desired manner. Split-toe bootees allow for some improvement in this functionality.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Reef walkers are small bootees that are only as high as the ankle and generally only 2 to 3.5mm thick. They are designed to allow surfers to get out to waves that break at coral reefs or at rocky beaches.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

====For kayaking====
Several styles of wetsuit boots are commonly used for [[kayaking]]. Short-cut boots are frequently used in warmer conditions where the boots help give grip and foot protection while launching and portaging. In cold conditions longer wetsuit boots may be used with a [[drysuit]] where they are worn over the rubber drysuit socks.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Gloves===
[[File:Guanti.jpg|thumb|alt=A pair of neoprene wetsuit gloves|Neoprene wetsuit gloves]]
{{expand section|date=February 2017}}
Wetsuit gloves are worn to keep the hands warm and to protect the skin while working. They are available in a range of thicknesses. Thicker gloves reduce manual dexterity and limit feel.&lt;ref name="Williams2003" /&gt; Wetsuit gloves are also commonly worn with dry suits. Some divers cut the fingertips of the gloves off on the fingers most used for delicate work like operating the controls on a camera housing.

'''William Bedle''' (22 February 1679 ([[Julian calendar]] date, equating to the year 1680 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]) – 3 June 1768) was an English [[cricket]]er who played for [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] and [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] in the first quarter of the 18th century. With the possible exception of [[Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond]], Bedle is the earliest known accomplished player, certainly the earliest who is renowned for his expertise as a player. He was born in [[Bromley]] but lived most of his life near [[Dartford]], where he was a wealthy farmer and grazier.

==Cricket career==
Bedle is the first known cricketer "who achieved great prominence in the game"&lt;ref name="RB48"/&gt; for it was said of him in his obituary in ''[[Lloyd's Evening Post]]'' dated 10 June 1768 that he was "formerly accounted the most expert cricket player in England".&lt;ref name="RB48"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GB48"/&gt; [[Rowland Bowen]] wrote that Bedle was thus "the first in a long line (of the best players in England) that must include [[Fuller Pilch]], [[W. G. Grace]], [[Jack Hobbs]] and [[Wally Hammond]]".&lt;ref name="RB48"&gt;Bowen, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment of his ability means that three things can be deduced: he was a great player; the means of judging a player's prowess were then available; and Bedle's reputation lasted at least a generation after his playing career ended.&lt;ref name="RB48"/&gt;

Bedle played in the first quarter of the 18th century&lt;ref name="stats" group="fc"&gt;Note that surviving match records to 1825 are incomplete and any statistical compilation of a player's career in that period is based on ''known'' data. Match scorecards were not always created, or have been lost, and the matches themselves were not always recorded in the press or other media. Scorecard data was not comprehensive: e.g., bowling analyses lacked balls bowled and runs conceded; bowlers were not credited with wickets when the batsman was caught or stumped; in many matches, the means of dismissal were omitted.&lt;/ref&gt; and his career dates are tentatively given as 1700 to 1725 (ages 21 to 46), though the span could have been much greater.&lt;ref name="U43"/&gt; He was a member of [[Dartford Cricket Club]], which was "the greatest Kent team of the first half of the eighteenth century" and which was often representative of [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] as a county.&lt;ref name="U43"&gt;Underdown, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dartford club's website records that Bedle was "the first great player in cricketing annals" and "the earliest Dartford cricketer whose name has come down to posterity".&lt;ref name="DCC"/&gt;

Few details of cricket matches in the 17th and early 18th centuries have survived and so what is known about Bedle's career has been pieced together by historical analysis as contemporary newspaper reports rarely mentioned a player by name.&lt;ref name="RB48"/&gt; The reason for this lack of surviving data is that [[freedom of the press]] was not allowed in England until 1696, when Bedle was 16, and the infant newspaper industry gradually introduced coverage of sporting events, though for many years their emphasis was on betting rather than on the matches themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; During Bedle's career, cricket reports were not only brief but few and far between.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Even without written record of his exploits, Bedle's reputation was known and shared by a public that was growing increasingly interested in cricket.&lt;ref name="RB48"/&gt; As Bowen comments in his history, it is significant that he was remembered as the best player in England some forty years after his career ended.&lt;ref name="RB48"/&gt;

[[Image:Oldest cricket bat.JPG|right|thumb|350px|A surviving example of the type of [[cricket bat|bat]] that was in use during William Bedle's career.]]
Bedle used a bat that was shaped like a modern hockey stick, this being the ideal shape for addressing a ball that was "trundled" or "skimmed" along the ground, as in [[lawn bowls]], and given that he was "the most expert player", he was effective in the timing and variety of his strokes.&lt;ref name="DB38"&gt;Birley, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlers in the 18th century used the [[underarm bowling|underarm]] style exclusively but at varying pace and it is unknown if Bedle was a fast or a slow bowler.&lt;ref name="DB38"/&gt; The ball was either rolled along the ground or, if a fast bowler, skimmed across the surface; pitching was not introduced until about 1760.&lt;ref name="DB38"/&gt;

Dartford was one of the two most successful clubs in England, its only rival being the [[London Cricket Club]].&lt;ref&gt;Underdown, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Dartford's prowess is borne out by a 1723 journal entry recorded by the prominent [[Tory]] politician [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;At Dartford upon the Heath (i.e., [[Dartford Brent]]) as we came out of the town, the men of Tonbridge and the Dartford men were warmly engaged at the sport of cricket, which of all the people of England the Kentish folk are the most renowned for, and of all the Kentish men, the men of Dartford lay claim to the greatest excellence.&lt;ref name="DCC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dartfordcc.co.uk/our-history/club-history |title=Our history: Cricket in Dartford |publisher=Dartford Cricket Club |date=2012 |accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U42"&gt;Underdown, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Records have survived of six matches involving Dartford or Kent teams against London or [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] between 1700 and 1725. The earliest known inter-county match took place in the [[List of English cricket matches to 1725|1709 season]] between Kent and Surrey on Dartford Brent. The result is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, ''Fresh Light on Pre-Victorian Cricket'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; London hosted Kent at [[White Conduit Fields]] in August 1719 and July 1720, Kent winning the first and London the second.&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; There were London v Dartford fixtures in July 1722 and then two in June 1724. The 1722 match, played on White Conduit Fields, was the subject of a letter in ''The Weekly Journal'' dated 21 July 1722. Of the two 1724 matches, the second one was the earliest known match at [[Kennington Common]], near where [[The Oval]] is now sited. The results of these matches are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Bedle was a near contemporary of [[Edwin Stead]], the first great patron of Kent cricket who is known to have had a Dartford connection. Stead was 22 years younger than Bedle but it is possible that they were colleagues in the mid to late 1720s.&lt;ref name="U42"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Bedle lived near Dartford for most of his life and he was a wealthy farmer and grazier.&lt;ref name="DCC"/&gt; His name, also spelled Beddel, is recorded on a tablet in Dartford Parish Church listing the bellringers of 1749.&lt;ref name="DCC"/&gt; He died at his home near Dartford on 3 June 1768, aged 88.&lt;ref name="GB48"&gt;Buckley, ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
