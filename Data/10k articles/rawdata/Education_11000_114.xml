      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3696">'''Ability to benefit''' ('''ATB''') is a term used in the context of [[post-secondary education]] in the United States to refer to students who have sufficient competency to benefit from post-secondary education but do not have a [[high school diploma]] or the [[General Educational Development|Certificate of High School Equivalency]]. ATB, as assessed by government-approved tests, is required for receiving financial aid by most US public colleges that admit students without a high school diploma or the certificate of equivalency. Until July 2012, such students could also receive student loans and grants from the US government if they had passed an approved ATB examination. However, the provision was dropped as part of the cuts to the Federal budget for fiscal year 2012.&lt;ref name= "IHE1" /&gt;

In some US states such as [[California]], even when such students are not requesting financial aid, private post-secondary institutions are "required, prior to executing an enrollment agreement with an ATB student, to have the student take and pass an independently administered examination from the list of examinations prescribed by the [[United States Department of Education]]".&lt;ref&gt;State of [[California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education]]. [http://www.bppe.ca.gov/schools/ability_exam.shtml "Ability-to-Benefit (ATB) Examination"]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', in 2012 about 82,000 students at US public two-year colleges had been admitted under ATB (approximately 1% of the total [[community college]] population) although not all of them were receiving financial aid. A longitudinal study from the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] found that only 33% of students admitted under ATB in 2003 had earned a college credential by 2009.&lt;ref name= "IHE1"&gt;Nelson, Libby A. (20 March 2012). [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/03/20/colleges-worry-about-end-federal-aid-based-ability-benefit#ixzz2ucqRGver "No Diploma, No GED, No Aid"]. ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also suggested that they were more likely to default on student loans.

The [[Government Accountability Office|US Government Accountability Office]] expressed concern, in 2009, that some for-profit colleges were helping students to cheat on the ATB examination or were falsifying the results in order for their students to receive Federal financial aid.&lt;ref name = "IHE2"&gt;Lederman, Doug (22 September 2009). [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/09/22/gao "Lacking the 'Ability to Benefit'"]. ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Students who had received a Federal direct loan or a Federal Family Education Loan via ATB prior to 2012 can apply to have the loan forgiven or discharged if they can demonstrate that their school falsely certified their ability to benefit from its training.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Education, Federal Student Aid Office.

'''Albert Sidney Beckham''' (1897–1964) was a pioneering African American psychologist. He specialized in [[educational psychology]] and made significant contributions to the base of knowledge about the racial intelligence score disparity. Additionally, he was a professor at [[Wilberforce University]] and [[Howard University]] and served the Chicago school district as the first African American school psychologist.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Graves, Scott. "Albert Sidney Beckham: The first African-American school psychologist." School Psychology International February 2009 vol. 30 no. 1 5-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Beckham was born on September 21, 1897, in [[Camden, South Carolina]], to Elizabeth and Calvin Beckham.&lt;ref name="Guthrie, R.V. 1998. p. 170"&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998). p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a local merchant and businessman. From early on his parents put great emphasis on and were very supportive of his education. They sent him to Christian schools and provided him with tutors.&lt;ref name="Guthrie, R.V. 1998. p. 170"/&gt; Given the government sanctioned segregation at the time, the type of proactive stance towards education that Beckham’s parents took was really the only way for an African American to get a quality education.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The battle with educational segregation only worsened when Beckham began to look towards higher education. College education in the south was almost not an option for African Americans at this time, moving north was a necessity. In 1915, he graduated from [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]], with a bachelor's degree,&lt;ref name="Guthrie, R.V. 1998. p. 170"/&gt; then received a second bachelor's degree from [[Ohio State University]] in 1916.&lt;ref name="Guthrie, R.V. 1998. p. 170"/&gt; He received his master's degree in Psychology in 1917&lt;ref name="Guthrie, R.V. 1998. p. 170"/&gt; and subsequently his PhD in psychology from [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="Guthrie, R.V. 1998. p. 170"/&gt; Beckham eventually earned a Ph.D. in educational psychology and began working for the Institute for Juvenile Research.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"&gt;Graves, Scott (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It was working at the institute that he met his wife, Ruth Howard. She, too, was a psychologist working at the institute.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt;

==Education==
At the age of 15, Beckham enrolled at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; At Lincoln, Beckham studied alongside Francis Sumner, graduating with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1915. Moving quickly through academic paths that had not been traveled by many African Americans before him, Beckham enrolled in Ohio State University where he earned a second bachelor's degree in 1916 and then a master's degree in psychology the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Beckham’s education was interrupted by his call to serve his country. From 1917 until 1920, Beckham worked as a professor at Wilberforce University at the direction of U.S. armed forces.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; In 1921, after concluding his service, Beckham enrolled at Columbia University to pursue a doctorate degree in psychology. After taking some courses at Columbia, Beckham transferred to New York University because it offered better financial aid.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; Beckham continued his studies at NYU until 1924, when he accepted a position as a professor at Howard University.&lt;ref name="Guthrie 1998"&gt;Guthrie (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Beckham returned to NYU and continued his doctorate work. In 1930, Beckham was awarded a Ph.D. in educational psychology from New York University’s School of Education.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt;

==Career==
Beckham became a professor of psychology, somewhat unintentionally, at the age of twenty. Beckham did not seek out his first teaching job. Immediately after completing his master's degree, Beckham enlisted in the Air Force with aspirations to be a pilot in World War I. Beckham’s application came during a time of serious segregation within the armed forces.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; The Air Force rejected Beckham’s application; it would be decades before an African American became an Air Force pilot. After persistent inquiry, the Air Force told Beckham that he could best serve his country by being a War Professor of Psychology at Wilberforce University.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; Beckham remained at Wilberforce, a private university that served African Americans, from 1917 until 1920. From 1920 until 1924, Beckham studied at Columbia University and New York University.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; During this time he was the editor of a newspaper called the New York City Dispatch, he also worked closely with the New York public schools.&lt;ref name="Guthrie 1998"/&gt;

In 1924, Beckham took a position as the first psychology professor at Howard University. He began as an instructor but later became an assistant professor, he taught a wide variety of psychology courses at Howard.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; Although his contributions as a professor were impressive,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Beckham’s greatest impact on the Howard psychology department was the laboratory he founded. This laboratory was the first of its kind at a Black university. One of the first and most prominent courses of study in the laboratory regarded intelligence differences in children of different ethnicities. As mainstream psychology made claims about the intellectual inferiority of African American children, Beckham’s lab conducted research to refute these studies.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; The laboratory was also used for individual consultations with the school districts in Washington D.C. Beckham’s work with the school districts helped to establish a relationship between Howard and the surrounding public schools. In 1928, Beckham left Howard to continue his doctorate studies.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; After earning his doctorate, Beckham took a job the Institute for Juvenile Research, which was devoted to researching and resolving juvenile delinquency. In the time that he was at the institute, Beckham served as a Fellow of the National Committee for Mental Health and as a Senior Assistant Research Psychologist. The organization provided delinquent children with psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers. It was also used to administer tests, provide training for teachers, and evaluate other clinics.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt;

Due to pay cuts that were the result of the Great Depression, Beckham left his job at the institute in 1935. The job search proved difficult. Beckham applied to work for the Chicago Board of Education, but there were not many jobs at the time. Additionally, being African American made finding work more difficult.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; Beckham was the first choice for the board of education, but he was not actually hired until the National Urban League pressured the city to hire him. The director of the board sent him to work at DuSable High School in Chicago. Beckham became the school psychologist at DuSable, establishing one of the first public school psychological clinics. DuSable served primarily African American students.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; At DuSable Beckham did unprecedented work involving students, families, and the community.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} He created a clinic for parents to give them support in raising their adolescents and created programs that involved local churches. In this way he developed a strong community at DuSable, a high school that served a large low-income housing development.&lt;ref name="Guthrie 1998"/&gt; Beckham worked for the board of education until his death in 1964 and conducted a great deal of research simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Guthrie 1998"/&gt; Additionally, Beckham and his wife, Ruth Howard, had a private practice called the Center for Psychological Services throughout most of their married life.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt;

==Areas of study==
Beckham’s scholarly work largely focused on education; however, he also conducted studies on topics such as albinism, narcolepsy, race attitudes, and life satisfaction&lt;ref name=Abramson&gt;{{cite web|last=Abramson|first=Charles|title=Brief Biographies|url=http://psychology.okstate.edu/museum/afroam/bio.html|publisher=Oklahoma State University|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite never holding a position at a university after completing his doctorate, Beckham was a prolific researcher.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt;

===Intelligence testing===
One of Beckham’s areas of interest was intelligence testing. This came out of necessity because mainstream psychology was claiming that African Americans were intellectually inferior due to the disparities in intelligence test scores in African American and Caucasian children.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; Beckham’s generation of African American psychologists had a different relationship to the intelligence test than post-civil rights era psychologists. Beckham and his colleagues saw the intelligence test as a tool that, if used correctly, could debunk the myth of Black inferiority. They did not question the test itself, rather they focused on matching background variables and building rapport between the testers and those taking the test.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt; The majority of the researchers in this time, Beckham included, argued that environmental differences were the cause of the intelligence score disparities. Some of Beckham’s studies regarding intelligence testing include: “The intelligence of a Negro high school population in a northern city” (1939) and “A study of the intelligence of different social-economic status in typical metropolitan areas” (1933). The 1933 study showed that intelligence scores and social-economic status were significantly correlated.&lt;ref name="A study of the intelligence of colored adolescents of different social-economic status in typical metropolitan areas."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckham|first=Albert|title=A study of the intelligence of colored adolescents of different social-economic status in typical metropolitan areas.|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|year=1933|volume=4|pages=70–91|doi=10.1080/00224545.1933.9921558}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an important finding as it detracted support from the theory that African Americans were intellectually inferior. One of Beckham’s most influential studies regarded intelligence outside of an educational framework. “Minimum intelligence levels for several occupations” (1930) was a study that looked at the IQ score needed to fulfill certain menial labor positions. Beckham looked at the abilities of people with mental ages from five to twelve and assessed their ability to fulfill certain tasks. For example, Beckham found that boys with a mental age of five could handle cinders and garbage, while boys with a mental age of twelve could be lawn care takers.&lt;ref name="Beckham 1930"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckham|first=Albert|title=Minimum intelligence levels for several occupations|journal=Personnel Journal|year=1930|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham executed this by having employers rate their employees and then giving the employees the Stanford Binet intelligence inventory. He found that employees who were rated ‘excellent’ had, on average, a higher mental age. From this Beckham concluded that a more intelligent worker is a better worker. Additionally, he concluded that a mental age of eight is sufficient for jobs with “considerable” amounts of responsibility and that people with a mental age of ten or greater were equipped to handle intelligent responsibility.&lt;ref name="Beckham 1930"/&gt; The high value that this study places on the Stanford Binet intelligence inventory is very indicative of the attitudes of the era in which it was written. The publication of this work was very pertinent because employers were beginning to put more of an emphasis on selecting employees based on intelligence level.&lt;ref name="Beckham 1930"/&gt; This study was published in the Personnel Journal and was used to train the mentally handicapped.&lt;ref name="Guthrie 1998" /&gt;

===Biological studies===
Beckham was interested in specific medical conditions in African American populations. “Albinism in Negro children” (1946) and “Narcolepsy among Negros” explored these topics.&lt;ref name="Guthrie 1998"/&gt;

===Race-related studies===
Beckham studied race and the effects of racism. His 1929 study “Is the Negro happy?” was designed to measure the life satisfaction of African Americans despite racism, segregation, and discrimination.&lt;ref name="Beckham 1929"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckham|first=Albert|title=In the Negro happy?|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1929|volume=24|issue=2|doi=10.1037/h0072938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham asked three questions: “Is the Negro happy?”, “Are you happy as a Negro?”, and “Should the Negro be happy?”. He worded the questions in exactly this manner with no disambiguation because he felt that, although there would be different interpretations of these questions, the answers given would reflect a general emotion and attitude.&lt;ref name="Beckham 1929"/&gt;  Beckham surveyed 3,443 African-American people who he grouped by occupation: college students, doctors, lawyers, unskilled laborers, preachers, housewives, teachers, and musicians. Overall the study showed that, while the majority of African Americans reported being happy, a majority also reported that African Americans are not and should not be happy.&lt;ref name="Beckham 1929"/&gt; These answers were different within the occupational groups though; in many cases the majority of one group would answer in the opposite way of the majority of another group. Beckham took the overall responses as an indication that African Americans were in the habit of simulating happiness for themselves despite an awareness of their dismal situations, he called this the Negro complex.&lt;ref name="Beckham 1929"/&gt; The conclusions Beckham draws from this study are interesting, however, it is important to recognize that the questions that he asked were not very clear. The way in which he framed these questions leaves them up to a great deal of interpretation. While this was a somewhat intentional, the fact that they are so open-ended means that any conclusions drawn from the answers are very loose. Additionally, in his final analysis, Beckham looks at the total numbers rather than looking proportionately at the occupational groups. This is one way to measure the data, but it would be more accurate to take the proportions into consideration because the groups are uneven in number. Using proportions would give a better indication of African Americans as a whole. While this study was flawed, the concept of examining the psychological impacts of oppression was new and valuable.&lt;ref name="Beckham 1929"/&gt; Beckham did other such studies. “A study of race attitudes in Negro children of adolescent age” (1934) looked at racial attitudes in a number of different contexts. It looked at the way African American children regarded people of other races and also the way racial prejudice impacted the children. Within these questions, the study examined how these children’s attitudes differed based on where they lived and whether they had behavioral problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckham|first=Albert|title=A study of race attitudes in Negro children of adolescent age|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1934|volume=29|issue=1|doi=10.1037/h0070753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mentally disabled and delinquent children===
Beckham studied abnormality in children and adolescents. Both as a school psychologist and a psychologist at the Institute for Juvenile Research Beckham saw a lot of abnormality in his career.&lt;ref name="Abramson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Scott (2009) Some of his research reflected this. "Juvenile crime" (1932), "Juvenile delinquency and the Negro" (1931), and "Over-suggestibility in juvenile delinquency" (1933) all demonstrated his interest in these issues. Some of Beckham’s studies on intelligence scores focused on the mentally disabled. One unpublished study entitled "A study of retarded children and their mothers" explored the relationships between the specific disabilities of children and the intelligence of their mothers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
Beckham was a pioneer in the field of Black psychology. He was among the first African Americans to earn a PhD in psychology and was involved in the founding and ground-level of unprecedented programs for African Americans. He taught university students at Wilberforce University and Howard University and provided guidance to thousands of students in the Chicago public school system.&lt;ref name="Guthrie 1998"&gt;Guthrie (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; His greatest research achievements fall under the headings of intelligence and behavioral disorders. In these fields Beckham provided alternative theories to mainstream psychology’s suggestions that African Americans were inherently deficient.&lt;ref name="Graves, Scott 2009"/&gt;

'''Amabel Anderson Arnold''' [[LL.M.]] (May 31, 1883 – February 18, 1936) was an American lawyer and law professor who organized the Woman's State Bar Association of Missouri, the first association of women lawyers in the world.&lt;ref name="ALMANAC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Role in Missouri History, 1821-1971|url=https://law.wustl.edu/Staff/Taylor/WOMEN/MOOFFMAN/mooff2/1stlib.htm|website=MISSOURI ALMANAC, 1971-1972|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manual"&gt;{{cite book|title=Official Manual of the State of Missouri|date=1971|publisher=Secretary of State|page=18|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=47QqAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

==Early life==
Amabel Anderson was born in Chatham, Ontario, on May 31, 1883. Her father was a natural-born United States citizen and her mother belonged to the Burgess family, of English ancestry, known among the most progressive people of [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]] - well educated, prosperous and of sterling quality. She had one brother, Charles.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

The Andersons moved to [[London, Ontario]] where Anderson attended her first two years of primary education. Summers and the Christmas seasons were spent at their mother's old home near [[Aylmer, Ontario]]. Later the family moved to Michigan, where public school wasn't as progressive as it had been in Canada. Anderson managed to pass her high school entrance examination thanks to the private tutoring of a retired teacher she called "School Madam".&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

Anderson entered high school at 12 years old at the third district school in [[Tuscola County, Michigan]]. The Anderson family had to move again when Anderson's father was transferred to [[Bay City, Michigan]], where Anderson spent the years between 14 and 20; at this time, attending high school, she studied music and sketching. Without completing high school, at 16, she started to teach in the lower grades and at the same time she was actively engaged in church and club work, on several occasions organizing and promoting literary and physical culture clubs.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

The chance to attend a course at Ferris Normal School, pushed her to complete her high-school course. She continued to attend the Ferris Normal School, and became the principal of a ten-grade school. She continued to teach and study, and completed the normal course and also a course in painting.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

After some years spent as a teacher, in 1910 Anderson entered the City College of Law and Finance, attending the night courses. While attending the College, she was the only woman student in her class. She successfully completed three years of law school, two of courses and one of lectures. The fourth year, the work field, she enrolled at Benton College of Law, again the only woman. Having attended two law schools, she graduated from both: she received an LL.M. degree from Benton College of Law on June 6, 1912 and a LL.B. from City College of Law and Finance on June 11, 1912.&lt;ref name="ALMANAC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

==Career==
In 1907 Anderson moved to St. Louis and she opened and managed for 6 years the Arnold Preparatory School in the Benoist Building. They enrolled many men, and some women, whose early education had been neglected. Anderson and her assistants tutored them privately and placed them in nearly every department of every college and university in St. Louis and in other cities. Anderson built for herself a lasting name as a competent and modern teacher.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Illinois Bar Journal, Volume 23|journal=Illinois State Bar Association|date=1934|volume=23|page=11|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=kXazAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, while operating her own school, Anderson also accepted a position as instructor of Latin in the Dental Department of the [[Saint Louis University]], the only woman in the faculty.&lt;ref name="ALMANAC" /&gt; She was also professor of medical botany at the American Medical College, again the only woman instructor.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

In 1912 Anderson organized the Women's National College Club, with headquarters in St. Louis, serving as its national president. Her idea was to expanding her school work and prepare to merge her preparatory school to some larger institution.&lt;ref name="ALMANAC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manual" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

On July 15, 1912, Anderson was among the St. Louis women attorneys who organized the Woman's State Bar Association of Missouri, the first association of women lawyers in the world. [[Caroline G. Thummel]] was the President.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

In September 1913, Anderson was elected director of the Woman's Department at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], the first woman holding such office in the United States.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Anne|title=Notable women of St. Louis, 1914|date=1914|publisher=St. Louis, Woodward|pages=13–16|url=https://archive.org/details/notablewomenofst00john}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Banta's Greek Exchange: Published in the Interest of the College Fraternity World, Volume 20, Edizione 3|date=1932|publisher=George Banta Company, Incorporated|page=251|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=GvTmAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 Anderson was appointed on the regular faculty of the City College of Law and Finance as lecturer and instructor in the chair of International Law, again, the only woman holding such a position in St. Louis.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

Anderson was an advocate of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] and [[Women's suffrage in the United States]].&lt;ref name="ALMANAC" /&gt; She was a charter member of the [[Equal Suffrage League (St. Louis)]], and sent out the first invitations to business women, asking them to meet to consider the organization of a league to further suffrage.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Anderson married W. E. Arnold, a medical student at the American Medical College.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; They divorced December 2, 1912, and she went back to use her maiden name.&lt;ref name="ALMANAC" /&gt;

Anderson is buried at [[Graceland Cemetery]], Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=Thomas E.|title=Where They're Buried: A Directory Containing More Than Twenty Thousand Names of Notable Persons Buried in American Cemeteries, with Listings of Many Prominent People who Were Cremated|date=1998|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|page=4|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=eLWao2lIGTEC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6745">A '''college tour''' is a series of campus visits to a number of colleges or universities (two or four year) by a prospective student (freshman, transfer, or graduate.) College tours may be taken individually or by school groups and educational programs as a way for a large number of people to visit several schools over a short period of time. In addition, many colleges now offer virtual tours on the [[Internet]].

==Campus visit==
A college tour is composed of multiple, distinct campus visits. In most cases a campus visit involves an information session directed by an admissions officer and a walking tour of campus conducted by a student ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Janet, and Sandra Maleson; “The Ten Step Plan for Successful College Visits” Introduction; Visiting College Campuses 7th ed.; Random House; New York, NY; 2004; {{ISBN|0-375-76400-3}}, page xvii&lt;/ref&gt; A campus visit can be taken by individual students and their families, with the student and parents often joining other individuals to create a larger group. Many colleges offer “open houses” usually consisting of a day or series of days set aside for students and their families to visit a particular school. Often there will be special programs or presentations during these times which would not be available during a regular visit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsu.edu/openhouse/ “Admissions: Open House”], [[North Carolina State University]]. Retrieved on 10-28-2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcu.edu/215.asp “Western Carolina University – Open House”], [[Western Carolina University]] Retrieved on 10-28-2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most colleges and universities also offer private tours and information sessions for large groups from a single school or educational program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamu.edu/visit/visits/visits.html#groupVisit “Campus Visit Options”], [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. Retrieved on 10-28-2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugadm.northwestern.edu/freshman/visiting/large-group.htm “Large Group visits, Visiting Freshmen”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703191021/http://www.ugadm.northwestern.edu/freshman/visiting/large-group.htm |date=2009-07-03 }}, [[Northwestern University]], Retrieved on 10-28-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Counselors and admissions officers often urge students to visit colleges before applying.
Students often use their observations from college visits to make a final selection.

College tours are usually planned 2 to 4 weeks in advance and more for larger schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/Section/Choosing-a-College-The-Importance-of-the-Campus-Tour.id-305414,articleId-55323.html “Choosing a College: The Importance of the Campus Tour”], [[CliffsNotes]]. Retrieved on 10-28-2009&lt;/ref&gt; Students are encouraged to plan their visit during the school year when classes are in session to get a true sense campus life.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, Dawn B.; “The College Visit: An Overview” Introduction; ''Guide to College Visits'' 3rd ed.; Peterson’s; Lawrenceville, NJ; 2001; {{ISBN|0-7689-0653-9}}, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Zola Dincin.

Retrieved on 10-28-2009&lt;/ref&gt; A family campus visit can be arranged by calling the school's visitor center or admissions office.  Many colleges allow students to register for their college tour on the campus website.
Group campus tours are planned by high school counselors, parent-teacher associations, and educational programs such as [[Boys and Girls Club of America]] or [[Upward Bound]]. [[Tour operator]]s also offer paid services to plan and arrange college tours for groups in addition to transportation, lodging and activities.

===Information session===
An admissions information session provides prospective students with knowledge about the college they are applying to.  These sessions usually last thirty minutes to an hour and include information about admissions requirements, financial aid, and academic requirements for acceptance to that particular institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/apply/undergraduateadmissions/visitgw/visitoptions “Visit Options”] [[The George Washington University]].

Retrieved on 10-28-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campus tour===
The walking campus tour allows students to see the campus including academic buildings, residence halls, dining halls, athletic fields, and other areas.  Some tours offer students a glimpse into a dorm or classroom but this varies from campus to campus.  Walking tours are usually conducted by a current student ambassador who, in addition to pointing out campus highlights, answers student questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plattsburgh.edu/alumni/studentambassadors/ “Student Ambassador Program at SUNY Plattsburgh”], [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9634">'''Cultural history''' combines the approaches of [[anthropology]] and [[history]] to look at [[popular culture|popular cultural]] traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and [[narrative]] descriptions of past matter, encompassing the continuum of events (occurring in succession and leading from the past to the present and even into the future) pertaining to a [[culture]].

Cultural history records and interprets past events involving human beings through the [[social]], [[cultural]], and [[political]] [[Social environment|milieu]] of or relating to [[the arts]] and manners that a group favors. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897) helped found cultural history as a discipline. Cultural history studies and interprets the record of [[human societies]] by denoting the various distinctive ways of living built up by a group of people under consideration. Cultural history involves the aggregate of past cultural activity, such as [[ceremony]], class in practices, and the interaction with locales.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Description==
Cultural history overlaps in its approaches with the French movements of ''[[histoire des mentalités]]'' (Philippe Poirrier, 2004) and the so-called new history, and in the U.S. it is closely associated with the field of [[American studies]]. As originally conceived and practiced by 19th Century Swiss historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] with regard to the [[Italian Renaissance]], cultural history was oriented to the study of a particular historical period in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting, sculpture and architecture, but for the economic basis underpinning society, and the social institutions of its daily life as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Giedion]], ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (6th ed.), p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Echoes of Burkhardt's approach in the 20th century can be seen in [[Johan Huizinga]]'s ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Sean Farrell |last=Moran |title=Johan Huizinga, ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'', and the Writing of History |journal=Michigan Academician |volume=42 |year=2016 |pages=410–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most often the focus is on phenomena shared by non-elite groups in a society, such as: [[carnival]], [[festival]], and public [[ritual]]s; [[performance]] traditions of [[Narrative|tale]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and other verbal forms; cultural evolutions in human relations (ideas, sciences, arts, techniques); and cultural expressions of social movements such as [[nationalism]]. Also examines main historical concepts as [[power (sociology)|power]], [[ideology]], [[Social class|class]], [[culture]], [[cultural identity]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[perception]] and new historical methods as narration of body. Many studies consider adaptations of traditional culture to [[mass media]] (television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, etc.), from [[Printing|print]] to [[film]] and, now, to the [[Internet]] (culture of [[capitalism]]). Its modern approaches come from [[art history]], [[Annales School|Annales]], [[Marxist]] school, [[microhistory]] and new cultural history.

Common theoretical [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]]s for recent cultural history have included: [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s formulation of the [[public sphere]] in ''The Structural Transformation of the Bourgeois Public Sphere''; [[Clifford Geertz]]'s notion of '[[thick description]]' (expounded in, for example, ''The Interpretation of Cultures''); and the idea of [[memory]] as a cultural-historical category, as discussed in [[Paul Connerton]]'s ''How Societies Remember''.

===Historiography and the French Revolution===
The area where new-style cultural history is often pointed to as being almost a [[paradigm]] is the '[[Historical revisionism|revisionist]]' history of the [[French Revolution]], dated somewhere since [[François Furet]]'s massively influential 1978 essay ''Interpreting the French Revolution''. The 'revisionist interpretation' is often characterised as replacing the allegedly dominant, allegedly [[Marxist]], 'social interpretation' which locate the causes of the Revolution in class dynamics. The revisionist approach has tended to put more emphasis on '[[political culture]]'. Reading ideas of political culture through Habermas' conception of the public sphere, historians of the Revolution in the past few decades have looked at the role and position of cultural themes such as [[gender]], [[ritual]], and [[ideology]] in the context of pre-revolutionary French political culture.

Historians who might be grouped under this umbrella are [[Roger Chartier]], [[Robert Darnton]], [[Patrice Higonnet]], [[Lynn Hunt]], Keith Baker, Joan Landes, Mona Ozouf and [[Sarah Maza]]. Of course, these scholars all pursue fairly diverse interests, and perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the paradigmatic nature of the new history of the French Revolution. Colin Jones, for example, is no stranger to cultural history, [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], or Marxism, and has persistently argued that the Marxist interpretation is not dead, but can be revivified; after all, Habermas' logic was heavily indebted to a Marxist understanding. Meanwhile, Rebecca Spang has also recently argued that for all its emphasis on difference and newness, the 'revisionist' approach retains the idea of the French Revolution as a watershed in the history of (so-called) [[modernity]], and that the problematic notion of 'modernity' has itself attracted scant attention.

==Cultural studies==
''[[Cultural studies]]'' is an academic discipline popular among a diverse group of scholars.  It combines [[political economy]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[art history]]/[[art criticism|criticism]] to study [[culture|cultural]] phenomena in various societies.  Cultural studies researchers often concentrate on how a particular phenomenon relates to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].  The term was coined by [[Richard Hoggart]] in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]]. It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who succeeded Hoggart as Director.

[[File:Cynthia McLeod.jpg|thumb|Cynthia McLeod in 1997]]
'''Cynthia Henri McLeod''' (born 4 October 1936) is a [[Suriname]]se [[author|novelist]].

==Background==
McLeod was born in [[Paramaribo]] as ''Cynthia Ferrier''; she is the daughter of [[Johan Ferrier]], the first [[President of Suriname]].&lt;ref name=suriname&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres78_07.jsp|title= Through The Eyes Of Cynthia Mcleod : A Historical Journey To Suriname In The 18th Century|accessdate= 13 March 2010|date= 29 March 2007|publisher= Caribbean Community Secretariat|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100622223137/http://caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres78_07.jsp|archivedate= 22 June 2010|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the half-sister of Dutch politician [[Kathleen Ferrier (politician)|Kathleen Ferrier]].

She completed her secondary school [[education in Suriname]] and continued her education in the Netherlands, where she studied to become a teacher in Child Care and Education. She married Dr. Donald McLeod whom she met in the Netherlands. In 1962 they went to [[Suriname]], where McLeod studied for a teaching degree in Dutch Language and [[Dutch Literature]]. From 1969 to 1978 she taught Dutch Language and Literature in pre-university education in Paramaribo. Her husband, Donald McLeod, was appointed in 1978 as Suriname’s Ambassador to [[Venezuela]]. Then he became Suriname’s Ambassador to Belgium and the United States. Abroad McLeod started writing and especially during her stay in Belgium she had the opportunity to do research in the archives of [[The Hague]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]], and [[Köln]].

In 1986 the McLeods returned to Suriname and in 1987 her debut novel ''Hoe duur was de suiker?'' (The Cost of Sugar) was published by publisher Vaco in Paramaribo. The first print was sold out within a few weeks and Cynthia McLeod became the most famous Surinamese novelist overnight. Later this historical novel about the [[sugar cane|sugar cane industry]] in the 18th century was published under license by her Dutch publisher [[Conserve (publisher)|Conserve]]. Soon other historical novels from her hand appeared, such as ''Hitchin wegwijzer vervolging''.

==Elisabeth Samson==
McLeod studied the life of [[Elisabeth Samson]] for over five years. Samson was a free black woman whose name occurs prominently in historical works on Suriname because she wanted to marry a white man (which was forbidden in the colony Suriname during the first half of the 18th century). The results of this research were first published as a study by the Faculty of Cultural Anthropology of the [[University of Utrecht]]. For eight years subsequently McLeod studied the social structure and life of that period, which allowed her to position Elisabeth as a rich free black person in this society dominated by prejudices and white supremacy. She then wrote the highly captivating novel: ''The Free Negress Elisabeth''[http://www.letterenfonds.nl/en/book/172/the-free-negress-elisabeth].

==Other activities==
As a result of her long research McLeod has gained a wealth of knowledge about Surinamese history; knowledge she gladly shares with others. For the Surinamese school youth she organizes free educational trips with her motorized vessel, the ''Sweet Merodia''. During these tours over the Surinamese Rivers, past former plantations, she captivates her audience with stories about its interesting past. She further engages in historic city tours through the centre of historic Paramaribo, which has been a [[UNESCO]] world heritage site since 2002.

'''Data-driven instruction''' is an educational approach that relies on information to inform teaching and learning. The idea refers to a method teachers use to improve instruction by looking at the information they have about their students. It takes place within the classroom, compared to [[Data-informed decision-making|data-driven decision making]]. Data-driven instruction works on two levels. One, it provides teachers the ability to be more responsive to students’ needs, and two, it allows students to be in charge of their own learning. Data-driven instruction can be understood through examination of its history, how it is used in the classroom, its attributes, and examples from teachers using this process.

== History ==
Prior to the current emphasis on data and accountability in schools, some school leaders and education researchers focused on [[Standards based reform|standards-based reform]] in education. From the idea of creating standards comes accountability, the idea that schools should report on their ability to meet the designated standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED546618|title=Building a New Structure for School Leadership|last=Elmore|first=Richard F.|publisher=Albert Shanker Institute|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the last century and in the early 2000s, an increased emphasis on accountability in public organizations made its way into the realm of education. With the passing of the [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act]] in 2001 came laws requiring schools to provide information to the public concerning the quality of education provided to students. To be able to provide such data, states were mandated to create accountability measures and yearly assessments to gauge the effectiveness of schools in meeting those measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Moriarty|first=Tammy Wu|title=Data-driven decision making: Teachers' use of data in the classroom|date=2013-01-01|degree=Ph.D.|publisher=University of San Diego|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1432373944/|place=United States -- California|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larocque|first=M|year=2007|title=Closing the Achievement Gap: The Experience of a Middle School|url=|journal=Clearing House|volume=80 |issue=4|pages=157–162|via=|doi=10.3200/tchs.80.4.157-162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following NCLB, more recent legislation under the [[Race to the Top|Race to the Top Act]] further pushed states to use data gathering and reporting to demonstrate school’s ability to meet the demands of the public. Embedded in both NCLB and the Race to the Top Act is an assumption that the collection and use of data can lead to increased student performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Brianna L.|last2=Datnow|first2=Amanda|date=2011-12-01|title=Student Involvement and Data-Driven Decision Making Developing a New Typology|url=http://yas.sagepub.com/content/43/4/1246|journal=Youth &amp; Society|language=en|volume=43|issue=4|pages=1246–1271|doi=10.1177/0044118X10388219|issn=0044-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attributes ==
Data in the classroom is any information that is visible during instruction that could be used to inform teaching and learning. Types of data include quantitative and qualitative data, although quantitative data is most often used for data-driven instruction. Examples of quantitative data include test scores, results on a quiz, and levels of performance on a periodic assessment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Data Wise: A Step-by-Step Guide to Using Assessment Results to Improve Teaching and Learning|last=Boudett|first=K. P.|last2=City|first2=E. A.|last3=Murname|first3=R. J.|publisher=Harvard Education Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of qualitative data include field notes, student work/artifacts, interviews, focus groups, digital pictures, video, reflective journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Reflective Educator’s Guide to Classroom Research: Learning to Teach and Teaching to Learn Through Practitioner Inquiry|last=Dana|first=N. F.|last2=Yendol-Hoppey|first2=D.|publisher=Corwin|year=2014|isbn=|edition= 3rd|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative and qualitative data is generally captured through two forms of assessments: formative and summative. Formative assessment is the information that is revealed and shared during instruction and is actionable by the teacher or student.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Black|first=P|last2=Wiliam|first2=D.|year=1998|title=Inside the Black Box: Raising Standards Through Classroom Assessment|url=|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=80 |issue=2|pages= 139–148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam offer examples of classroom assessment that is formative in nature, including student observations and discussions, understand pupils’ needs and challenges, and looking at student work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Conversely, summative assessments are designed to determine whether or not a student can transfer their learning to new contexts, as well as for accountability purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Formative assessment is the use of information made evident during instruction in order to improve student progress and performance. Summative assessments occur after teaching and learning occurred.

== Examples ==
Understanding the differences between quantitative data vs. qualitative data, as well as formative assessment vs. summative assessment that tease out this data can be defined as assessment literacy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Building assessment literacy also includes knowing when to use which type of assessment and the resulting data to use to inform instruction. The purpose of data driven instruction is to use information to guide teaching and learning. Dylan Wiliam offers examples of data driven instruction using formative assessment:
* Clarifying, sharing, and understanding learning intentions and criteria
* Eliciting evidence of learners’ achievement
* Providing feedback that moves learning forward
* Activating students as instructional resources for one another
* Activating students as owners of their own learning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Embedded Formative Assessment|last=Wiliam|first=Dylan|publisher=Solution Tree|year=2011|isbn=|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the lack of timely feedback regarding the results plus the inability to personalize the approach, summative assessments are not readily used for data driven instruction in the classroom. Instead, a variety of information gleaned from different forms of assessments should be used to make decisions about student progress and performance within data-driven instruction. The use of multiple measures of different forms and at different times to make instructional decisions is referred to as triangulation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Data-Driven Instructional Systems ==

=== Background and origins ===
Data-Driven Instructional Systems refers to a comprehensive system of structures that school leaders and teachers design in order to incorporate the data into their instructions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halverson, R., Grigg, J., Prichett, R., &amp; Thomas, C.|first=|date=2007|title=The new instructional leadership: Creating data-driven instructional systems in school|url=|journal=Journal of School Leadership|volume=17|issue=2 |pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on organizational and school change literature, Richard Halverson, Jeffrey Grigg, Reid Prichett, and Chris Thomas developed a DDIS framework in an attempt to describe how relevant actors manage school-level internal accountability to external accountability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Specifically, high-stakes external accountability policies such as [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB) was implemented to hold schools accountable for the reported standardized, summative assessment metrics. However, schools already had active internal accountability systems that place high emphasis on an ongoing cycle of instructional improvement based on the use of data including formative assessment results and behavioral information. Therefore, when the high-stakes accountability was implemented, schools naturally go through process of alignment between different types of data different purposes and the corresponding tension. Richard Halverson and his colleagues, employing case study approaches, explore leaders’ effort of coordination and alignment process which occurs between extant “central practices and cultures of schools” and “new accountability pressure” in a pursuit of improving student achievement score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halverson, R., Grigg, J., Prichett, R., &amp; Thomas, C.|first=|date=2007|title=The new instructional leadership: Creating data-driven instructional systems in school|url=|journal=Journal of School Leadership|volume=17|issue=2 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key concepts ===
In their article, Richard Halverson, Jeffrey Grigg, Reid Prichett, and Chris Thomas suggest that the DDIS framework is composed of six organizational functions: data acquisition; data reflection; program alignment; program design; formative feedback; test preparation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Data Acquisition ====
Data acquisition includes the data collection, data storage, and data reporting functions. “Data” in DDIS model is broadly conceptualized as any type of information that guides teaching and learning. In practice, schools collect academic data standardized assessment test scores, as well as non-academic data like student demographic information, community survey data, curricula, technological capacity, and behavioral records. In order to store such data, some schools develop their own local collection strategies using low-tech printouts and notebooks, whereas other schools rely on high-tech district storage systems, which provide tremendous amounts of reports. School leaders have discussions around which data needs to be reported and how to report the data in a way that they can use to guide teaching practices.

==== Data Reflection ====
In the DDIS model, data reflection refers to collectively making sense of the reported data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halverson, R., Grigg, J., Prichett, R., &amp; Thomas, C.|first=|date=2007|title=The new instructional leadership: Creating data-driven instructional systems in school|url=|journal=Journal of School Leadership|volume=17|issue=2|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; District-level data retreats provide key opportunities for the schools within districts to identify the school-level strengths and weaknesses in terms of achievement data. Retreats help districts to develop district-level visions for instruction. In contrast, through local data reflection meetings, teachers have conversations focused on the individual students’ progress by examining each student’s performance on the assessed standards.

==== Program Alignment ====
Richard Halverson and his colleagues states that program alignment function refers to “link[ing] the relevant content and performance standards with the actual content taught in classroom.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halverson, R., Grigg, J., Prichett, R., &amp; Thomas, C.|first=|date=2007|title=The new instructional leadership: Creating data-driven instructional systems in school|url=|journal=Journal of School Leadership|volume=17|issue=2|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the benchmark assessment results, as “problem-finding tools,” help educators to identify the curricular standards that are not aligned well with the current instructional programs.

==== Program Design ====
After identifying the main areas in relation to students learning needs and school goals, leaders and teachers design interventions: faculty-based programs; curriculum-based programs; and student-based programs. In an effort to improve the faculty’s data literacy, educators are provided with a variety of professional development opportunities and coaching focused on professional interaction (faculty-based programs). In addition, educators modify their curriculum as a whole-classroom approach (curriculum-based programs) or develop customized instructional plans taking into account individual students’ needs (student-based programs).

==== Formative Feedback ====
Educators interact with each other around the formative feedback on the local interventions implemented across classrooms and programs. Formative feedback systems are made of three main components: intervention, assessment, and actuation. Intervention artifacts here include curriculum materials like textbooks and experiments, or programs such as individualized education programs (Intervention). The effect of these intervention artifacts can be evaluated through formative assessments, either commercial or self-created, from the perspective that they had brought intended changes to teaching and learning (Assessment). In the actuation space, educators interpret the assessment results in relation to the initial goals of the intervention, and discuss how to modify the instruction delivery or assessment as measurement tools, which lays groundwork for the new interventions (Actuation).

==== Test Preparation ====
This function is not intended for teachers to “teach to the test.” Rather, it points to the following activities: curriculum-embedded activities, test practice, environmental design, and community outreach. Teachers incorporate the content of standardized assessment into their day-to-day instructions (curriculum-embedded activities), assist students to practice or be accustomed to test-taking with similar types of tests (test practice), and establish a favorable test-taking environment (environmental design). Further, teachers communicate with parents and the community members on the topics ranging from test implementation to interpreting the test results (community outreach).

== Implications ==

=== For school districts ===
The primary implication for school districts is in ensuring high quality and relevant data is gathered and available. Beyond creating systems to gather and share the data, the school district must provide the expertise, in the form of data expert personnel and/or the access to professional development resources to ensure school building leaders are able to access and use the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swan|first=G.|last2=Mazur|first2=J.|year=2011|title=Examining data driven decision making via formative assessment: A confluence of technology, data interpretation heuristics and curricular policy|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ939038|journal=Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education|volume=12 |issue=2|pages=205|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critical component of the responsibility of the district is to provide the leadership and vision to promulgate the use of information about student performance to improve teaching practice. Zavadsky and  Dolejs suggest two areas for school districts to consider:

“The first is data collection and analysis. Districts and schools must carefully consider what data they need to collect, develop instruments with which to collect the data, and make the data available as soon as possible. The second component is data use. Principals and district leaders must give teachers sufficient time and training to understand the data and learn how to respond to what the data reveal”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zavadsky|first=H.|last2=Dolejs|first2=A.|year=2006|title=DATA: Not Just Another Four-Letter Word|url=|journal=Principal Leadership, Middle Level Ed.|volume=7 |issue=2|pages=32–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the literature shows the vital importance of the role of the district in setting the stage for data driven instruction, more of the work of connecting student performance to classroom practices happens at the school and classroom level.

=== For schools ===
Schools have a major role in establishing the conditions for data-driven instruction to flourish. Heppen, et al. indicate a need for a clear and consistent focus on using data and a data-rich environment to support teachers’ efforts to use data to drive instruction. When the leadership creates and maintains an environment which promotes collaboration and clearly communicates the urgency to improve student learning, teachers feel supported to engage in data use. The additional scaffold of modeling the use of data at the school level increases teachers’ expertise in the use of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED536737|title=Using Data to Improve Instruction in the Great City Schools: Key Dimensions of Practice. Urban Data Study|last=Heppen|first=Jessica|last2=Faria|first2=Ann-Marie|last3=Thomsen|first3=Kerri|last4=Sawyer|first4=Katherine|last5=Townsend|first5=Monika|last6=Kutner|first6=Melissa|last7=Stachel|first7=Suzanne|last8=Lewis|first8=Sharon|last9=Casserly|first9=Michael|publisher=Council of the Great City Schools|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For teachers ===
Data-driven instruction is created and implemented in the classroom. Teachers have the most direct link between student performance and classroom practices. Through the use of data, teachers can make decisions about what and how to teach including how to use time in class, interventions for students who are not meeting standards, customizing lessons based on real-time information, adapting teaching practice to align to student needs, and making changes to pace, scope and sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton et al. - 2009 - Using student achievement data to support instruct.pdf. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED506645.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To be able to engage in data-driven instruction, teachers must first develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions required. Working in a school culture and climate in which data-driven instruction is valued and supported, teachers have the ability to increase student achievement and potentially reduce the achievement gap. Additionally, teachers must have access to learning opportunities or professional development which helps them understand the pedagogical framework and technical skills required to obtain, analyze, and use information about students to make instructional decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Furlong-Gordon|first=Jean Marie|title=Driving classroom instruction with data:  From the district to the teachers to the classroom|date=2009-01-01|degree=Ed.D.|publisher=Wilmington University (Delaware)|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/250914319/|place=United States -- Delaware|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For students ===
A significant new growth in data-driven instruction is in having students shape their lessons using data about their own progress. Younger learners who are able to self-report regarding grades and other assessments can experience high levels of achievement and progress within instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Visible Learning for Teachers: Maximizing Impact on Learning|last=Hattie|first=J.|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategies that students use to evaluate their own learning vary in effectiveness. In a meta-analysis, Dunlosky, Rawson, Marsh, Nathan &amp; Willingham ranked ten learning strategies based on the projected impact each would have on achievement:

Highly Effective Strategies:
* Practice testing
* Distributed practice
Moderately Effective Strategies:
* Elaborative interrogation
* Self-explanation
* Interleaved practice
Less Effective Strategies:
* Summarization
* Highlighting
* Keyword mnemonic
* Imagery use for text learning
* Rereading&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunlosky|first=J.|last2=Rawson|first2=K. A.|last3=Marsh|first3=E. J.|last4=Nathan|first4=M. J.|last5=Willingham|first5=D. T.|year=2013|title=Improving students’ learning with effective learning techniques promising directions from cognitive and educational psychology|url=|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|volume=14 |issue=1|pages=4–58|via=|doi=10.1177/1529100612453266}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is worth noting that the less effective strategies may be more commonly used in K-12 classrooms than the moderately effective and highly effective strategies. The authors suggest that students should be taught how to use more effective techniques and when they are most helpful in guiding their learning. When these strategies become internalized, students will have developed techniques in order to learn how to learn. This is critical as they move into the secondary level and are expected to be more independent in their studies.

== Criticisms ==
A major criticism of data driven instruction is that it focuses too much on test scores, and that not enough attention is given to the results of classroom assessments. Data driven instruction should serve as a “road map through assessment” that helps “teachers plan instruction to meet students’ needs, leading to better achievement”.&lt;ref&gt;Neuman, S. (2016). Code Red: The Danger of Data-Driven Instruction. Educational Leadership, 74(3), pps. 24-29&lt;/ref&gt; Summative assessments should not be used to inform the day-to-day teaching and learning that is supported by data-driven instruction. Additional problems associated with perceptions of data driven instruction include the limitations of quantitative data to represent student learning, not considering the social and emotional needs or the context of the data when making instructional decisions, and a hyperfocus on the core areas of literacy and mathematics while ignoring the encore, traditionally high-interest areas such as the arts and humanities.

{{Politics of Northern Ireland}}
The '''Department of Education''' ('''DENI''') ({{lang-ga|An Roinn Oideachais}}; [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]]: ''Männystrie o Lear'')&lt;ref&gt;''Depairtment o Leir'' is also used by the [[North/South Ministerial Council]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[devolved]] Northern Irish government department in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]].  The minister with overall responsibility for the department is the Minister of Education.

==Aim==
The department's overall vision is "to ensure that every learner fulfils her or his potential at each stage of development". Its key stated priorities are: raising Standards for all; closing the performance gap, increasing access and equality; developing the education workforce; improving the "learning environment"; and transforming education management.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Ireland Budget 2011–15, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The department is responsible for the following levels of education:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deni.gov.uk/index/85-about-the-dept.htm About the Department of Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
* pre-school
* primary
* post-primary
* special

Until 2016 the former [[Department for Employment and Learning]] was responsible for further and higher education policy in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delni.gov.uk/index/about-the-dept.htm DEL: About the Department] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419003354/http://www.delni.gov.uk/index/about-the-dept.htm |date=19 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further and higher education are now the responsibility of the [[Department for the Economy]].

The Department of Education also covers:
* youth policy
* community relations within and between schools
* teacher education and salaries

As an organisation, its key functions include advising the minister on the determination of education policy, framing legislation, accounting for the effectiveness of the education system, allocating, and monitoring and accounting for resources.

Through the Education and Training Inspectorate, it evaluates and reports on the quality of teaching and learning and teacher education.

Administration of the education system is delegated to a single combined authority, funded by the department:

* [[Education Authority]]

Its main counterpart in the [[United Kingdom Government]] is the [[Department for Education (United Kingdom)|Department for Education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gov.uk/aboutdfe Department for Education: About the Department]&lt;/ref&gt; The main counterpart in the [[Irish Government]] is the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Skills]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.ie/home/home.jsp?pcategory=17216&amp;ecategory=20662&amp;language=EN Department of Education and Skills: Functions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A [[Minister of Education (Northern Ireland)|Ministry of Education]] was established at the foundation of Northern Ireland in June 1921 and was subsequently renamed the Department of Education under [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]], introduced in March 1972.  An education ministry was also included in the [[Northern Ireland Executive (1974)|Northern Ireland Executive]] briefly formed in 1974. The department's remit under direct rule was much wider, incorporating cultural and sport policy (now held by the [[Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure]]) and further and higher education (now held by the [[Department for Employment and Learning]]).

Following a [[Northern Irish Belfast Agreement referendum, 1998|referendum]] on the [[Belfast Agreement]] on 23 May 1998 and the granting of [[royal assent]] to the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] on 19 November 1998, a [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]] were established by the [[United Kingdom Government]] under Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. The Department of Education (with its reduced remit) was therefore one of the six direct rule Northern Ireland departments that continued in existence after devolution, following the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] and [[The Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999]].

A devolved minister took office on 2 December 1999. Devolution was suspended for four periods, during which the department came under the responsibility of [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] ministers from the [[Northern Ireland Office]]:
* between 12 February 2000&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Commencement) Order 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and 30 May 2000;&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) Order 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
* on 11 August 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Suspension of Devolved Government) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* on 22 September 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Suspension of Devolved Government) (No.2) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) (No.2) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* between 15 October 2002&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Suspension of Devolved Government) Order 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and 8 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) Order 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 8 May 2007, devolution has operated without interruption. On 11 January 2012, the [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]], [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]] and [[Martin McGuinness]] respectively, announced their intention to abolish the Department for Employment and Learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice 2012 – Stormont Castle proposals|url=http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-releases-archive-ofmdfm-jan-2012/news-ofmdfm-10112-justice-2012-stormont.htm|publisher=Northern Ireland Executive|accessdate=29 March 2012|date=11 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423113009/http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-releases-archive-ofmdfm-jan-2012/news-ofmdfm-10112-justice-2012-stormont.htm|archivedate=23 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Its functions would be "divided principally" between the Department of Education and the [[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment]] "in an agreed manner". The proposal was resisted by the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford says cutting Department for Employment and Learning could damage economy|url=http://allianceparty.org/article/2012/006237/ford-says-cutting-department-for-employment-and-learning-could-damage-economy|publisher=Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|accessdate=29 March 2012|date=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which viewed it as "power grab" by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Sinn Féin]], but was approved on 18 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice 2012 – The Way Forward|url=http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-releases-archive-ofmdfm-jan-2012/news-ofmdfm-180112-justice-2012-the.htm|publisher=Northern Ireland Executive|accessdate=29 March 2012|date=18 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423112958/http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-releases-archive-ofmdfm-jan-2012/news-ofmdfm-180112-justice-2012-the.htm|archivedate=23 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; No timescale for the abolition was outlined and the department remained in operation, as of late March 2012.

From 2 December 1999 to 25 May 2016, the department was headed by [[Sinn Féin]] legislators. It was not until 25 May 2016 that the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)'s [[Peter Weir (politician)|Peter Weir]] became the first non-Sinn Féin politician to head the Northern Ireland Department of Education.

'''Diplomi-insinööri''' (DI) ({{lang-sv|diplomingenjör}}) is a Finnish Master's level [[academic degree]] with a nominal length of 300 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits. The official English translation of the degree is [[Master of Science]] (Technology). The Finnish name derives from the old [[Academic degree#Germany|German degree]] called ''[[Engineer's degree#Individual country variants before Bologna|Diplom-Ingenieur]]''.

The degree qualifies for the ''tekniikan lisensiaatti'' ([[Licenciate]] of Science (Technology)) and the ''tekniikan tohtori'' ([[Doctor of Science]] (Technology)) degrees. It is preceded directly by ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' (Bachelor of Science in Technology), and, with some additional study, by other Bachelor's level degrees. It is a taught master's degree, but includes a half-year project (''diplomityö'', ''Master's thesis'').

The ''diplomi-insinööri'' degree is granted by seven Finnish universities in a variety of [[degree program]]s. The common feature of the programs is the engineering approach based on scientific and mathematical studies. Usually, graduates with the degree work as experts, managers, researchers, or entrepreneurs. Many, if not most, of the middle and upper management in Finnish engineering and technology-based corporations are DIs.

Since 2005, the degree has been incorporated into the [[Bologna Process]] and all students admitted before 2005 were required to complete their studies by 2010 if they wished to graduate under the old statutes. The modern, Bologna-compatible includes an intermediate bachelor's degree ''tekniikan kandidaatti'', which is to be taken after three years studies (180 ECTS).&lt;ref&gt;Helsinki University of Technology Master 's level studies and courses [http://www.tkk.fi/en/studies/master-s_level_studies_and_courses/index.html HUT Sep 18 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In the old system, an intermediate degree did not exist, which was a problem for [[exchange student]]s going to study abroad in Masters-level studies.

In Finland, the higher education follows a dual model with science-and-letters-based universities and work-oriented [[Institute of technology#Finland - Ammattikorkeakoulu - Yrkeshögskola|polytechnics]]. In polytechnics, students may study for the degree ''insinööri (AMK)'', officially translated Bachelor of Engineering, which is a four-year, 240 ECTS program. The holders of ''insinööri (AMK)'' qualify to study straight for the ''diplomi-insinööri'' degree without the ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' degree in the same branch of technology, but must usually complete up to 60 ECTS worth of mathematical and scientific studies in addition to the normal master's degree requirement. Thus the master's program for ''insinööris (AMK)'' has a length of 180 ECTS or three years. Similar requirements apply, if a Bachelor with a university degree from a non-engineering program is admitted.

In both the new and the old system the degrees are classified into "pass" and "with distinction" (''oivallisesti'') categories. The rare "with distinction" classification (less than 10% of the graduates) requires a grade point average of at least 4.00/5 and a thesis with grade of at least 4/5.

==Universities==
Universities that grant the degree are:
* [[Aalto University]] (earlier ''Helsinki University of Technology'')
* [[Tampere University of Technology]]
* [[Lappeenranta University of Technology]]
* [[University of Oulu]]
* [[University of Turku]]
* [[University of Vaasa]]
* [[Åbo Akademi University|Åbo Akademi]]

The universities have a common entrance examination and selection process, ''DIA-valinta'' (''diplomi-insinööri- ja arkkitehtikoulutuksen yhteisvalinta''), which accounts for most of matriculations.

In 2001, about 35% of children between the ages of three and six were enrolled in some type of preschool program. 

It is estimated that about 45 percent of all students complete their primary education. The student-to-teacher ratio for primary school was at about 43:1 in 2000; the ratio for secondary school was about 23:1.

The [[National University of Equatorial Guinea]] is the primary institute of higher learning. The adult literacy rate for 2014 was estimated at about 95 percent, with 98 percent for youth 15-24 year old, the highest in sub-saharan Africa.

As of 2003, public expenditure on education was estimated at 0.6% of GDP, or 1.6% of total government expenditures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4394">The '''first solo flight''' of a new pilot comprises that pilot completing a take off, and usually a short flight and safe landing, by him or herself.  Flying such a flight is a milestone known as '''soloing'''. Being solo pilot of an aircraft is different from most other situations in that the pilot has not only to be able to fly and navigate the machine in a competent manner but he/she also has to be able to cope with unpredictable developments like mechanical failure, bad weather etc. on his/her own and without advice from other sources (most [[air traffic controller]]s are not pilots and may not be contactable anyway).

== Requirements ==
Depending on the country, there may be a requirement for some minimum number of training hours to have been completed by the student pilot before he or she is allowed to solo.  In most countries, it is assumed that such students will be familiar with (and may have to pass an examination on) the relevant Air Laws or Regulations, and will have completed exercises in handling aircraft in normal conditions, and also what to do in the case of engine failure on takeoff, in flight, and before landing.
[[Image:Pilot after first solo.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Student aircraft pilot who has had the tail of his shirt cut off after a solo flight.]]
In the United States, for most aircraft, there is no FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) requirement for a minimum number of hours. Per FAR Part 61 SFAR 73 section 2, Robinson helicopters have a 20-hour requirement to solo. However the regulations do require that a student pilot show competency in several specific skills to include, for example, the ability to [[Slip (aerodynamic)|forward slip]].&lt;ref name="aopa-ft-04-07-p43"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Namowitz| given=Dan | title=First solo follies | journal=AOPA Flight Training |volume=19 |issue=4 | year=2007 | pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, competence is mostly a judgment call of the [[Flight instructor|Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI)]] responsible for the student. Typically, it takes from 10 to 30 hours of flight time before a pilot has the instinctive feel of an aircraft to be safe flying solo in other than perfect (no wind) weather.
[[File:Solo cere.jpg|thumb|[[Jalil Zandi]]'s first solo flight ceremony in [[Vance Air Force Base]] in 1972]]

== Soloing ==
In some cases, when the student is given permission to fly alone the instructor directs the student to fly three circuits of the [[Airfield traffic pattern|traffic pattern]] each accompanied by a full stop landing.&lt;ref name="aopa-ft-04-07-p43"/&gt;  During the first circuit, the solo, the student's [[Flight instructor]] may supervise the student's performance from the ground, paying close attention to the approach and landing.  Some instructors keep a radio handy, if there is one in the aircraft, in case the student pilot should need assistance or advice.&lt;ref name="aopa-ft-04-07-p43"/&gt;

== Traditions ==
Several traditions have developed in the United States around "soloing", including drenching the student with water and cutting off and permanently displaying the back of his or her shirt.

In American aviation lore, the traditional removal of a new pilot's shirt tail is a sign of the instructor's new confidence in his student after successful completion of the first solo flight.  In the days of tandem trainers, the student sat in the front seat, with the instructor behind.  As there were often no radios in these early days of aviation, the instructor would tug on the student pilot's shirttail to get his attention, and then yell in his ear.  A successful first solo flight is an indication that the student can fly without the instructor ("instructor-less" flight).  Hence, there is no longer a need for the shirt tail, and it is cut off by the (often) proud instructor, and sometimes displayed as a trophy.&lt;ref name="FSX Rod Marchado"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Marchado| given=Rod | title=First Solo Flight | journal=Microsoft Flight Simulator X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Schools Bara''' (“Sekoly Maitso Bara”) is a sub-project of the Integrated Rural Development Project (IRDP) in the [[Bara people|Bara]]-Region (SoFaBa-FLM) and works in Fiherena [[Toliara]] Synod (SPFT) and [[Ihorombe]] (SPH) of the [[Malagasy Lutheran Church]] in the central south and south-west of [[Madagascar]].

==History==

SoFaBa started with its educational in 1998, and the development of “Green Schools” was part of the programme. The main focus was, however, given to encouraging the parents in the Bara-region to send their children to school and to build school houses in cooperation with the local community.

In 2003 there started a new period in SoFaBa’s educational work with a strong focus on the pedagogical work and on the general improvement of the quality of the existing schools. This includes a serious attempt to develop and introduce a Green Programme. The school in Ambatolahy in the [[Ankazoabo]] region became the first green pilot school. 

A new level was reached in 2005/2006 when a compulsory and holistic “Green School Programme” with many different components was introduced in all schools. By this way, the educational work in the Bara-region started by SoFaBa was strengthened and qualitatively improved. The Green Schools Bara continue and improve the work started within the SoFaBa-project putting a special emphasis on modern pedagogy, methodical renewal and social issues  like the promotion of girls and children with disabilities. Furthermore, the Green Schools Bara cooperates with the government for reaching Education for All - one of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]

==Objectives==

Green Education is an integrated education that includes all subjects. The heart of the matter is an education about the interplay of all life, the sustainable use of natural resources and the respect for and love to all creation. This requires “integrated teaching” that makes the interdependence between the single human being, the community and the surrounding ecological system obvious.

==Activities==


Green Schools Bara works in remote and low developed areas in the central south-west of Madagascar. There are few or no other development organizations in this area, the state is poorly represented and many children have no possibility to go to school.The project supports the objectives of the Malagasy government to ensure a basic education of high quality for all children by 2015.

The project's main activities are:
* Construction of village schools
* Renovation and improvement of existing school
* Improvement of teaching
* Teacher’s training
* Financial support to schools and teachers
* Support with equipment

In 2006, Green School Bara started with the elaboration and production of school books and pedagogical material. This resulted in a cooperation with the National Reading Centre at the [[University of Stavanger]], Norway, and, in 2007, the creation of an independent publishing company, [[Vakoka Vakiteny]].

==Schools==
[[File:Tamotamo village school.JPG|thumb|180px|The village school at Tamotamo under construction]]

The following schools are included in the project:
* Fiherena Toliara Synod ([[Atsimo Andrefana Region]])
** Ambatolahy
** Andaka
** Angavo
** Mahabo
** Mahazoarivo
** Marosakoa
** Mitsinjo Soatanimbary
** Tamotamo
* Ihorombe Synod ([[Ihorombe Region]])
** Ankasy
** Besakoa Anenjika
** Tsingilofilobe
==Funding==
Green Schools Bara is a project included in the Green Education Programme ProVert that is granted by the Norwegian Government (Norad) during the period 2007 - 2011. The financial support from ProVert will diminish gradually; at the same time the local shares will increase for ensuring the sustainability of the work. There will also be worked actively for finding individual partners supporting the single schools in these low developed and vulnerable area.

'''Gulf University for Science &amp; Technology''' ('''GUST''') is the first private university established in [[Kuwait]]. It has a dual-enrollment agreement with the [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]].

== History ==
The university was to be a supplement to [[Kuwait University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuniv.edu.kw/ Kuwait University].&lt;/ref&gt; the only institution of higher education in Kuwait at that time, and to serve the educational demands of the local society and the [[Persian Gulf]] region. In January 1997, Kuwaiti Academic Group, composed of 41 faculty members from Kuwait University, was founded to lay the foundation for the proposed “University of the Future.” Their studies culminated in a vision of the “Gulf University for Science &amp; Technology.”

A partnership was established with the University of Missouri at St. Louis ([[UMSL]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsl.edu/ UMSL]&lt;/ref&gt; the international counterpart university chosen to help bring the university to fruition. The development was facilitated by the Private Universities Decree, No. 34, issued by the State of Kuwait in 2000, resulting in the establishment of a temporary campus in Hawally. The issuance of Emiri Decree No. 156 in 2002 completed the legal establishment of GUST&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author2=M.

[[File:HannahMarshman.jpg|thumb|upright|Hannah Marshman]]

'''Hannah Marshman''' (13 May 1767, [[Bristol]] – 5 March 1847, [[Serampore]], India) was an English [[missionary]].

She was the daughter of John Shepherd, a farmer, and his wife Rachel, and the granddaughter of John Clark, pastor of the Baptist church at [[Crockerton]], [[Wiltshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hamilton, "Marshman, Joshua (1768–1837)", rev. Michael Laird, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18163 accessed 16 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother died when she was eight. In 1791 Hannah Shepherd married [[Joshua Marshman]]. In 1794, the couple moved from [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury Leigh]] in Wiltshire to Bristol, where they joined the [[Bristol city centre#Broadmead|Broadmead]] Baptist Church. The couple were to eventually have 12 children; of these only five lived longer than their mother.

Hannah is considered to be the first woman missionary in India.&lt;ref&gt;'Hannah Marshman', http://www.missionariesoftheworld.org/2011_07_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Missionary work ==
On 29 May 1799, Hannah, Joshua and their two children set out from [[Portsmouth]] for India aboard the ship ''Criterion''. Although there was a threat of a French naval attack, the family landed safely at the Danish settlement of Serampore (a few miles north of Calcutta) on 13 October 1799. They had chosen to land here because the [[East India Company]] was at that time hostile to missionaries. They settled in the Danish colony and were joined there by [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] on 10 January 1800.

On 1 May 1800, Joshua and Hannah Marshman opened two boarding schools at Serampore. The schools became the most popular in the Presidency and their son [[John Clark Marshman]] received his education from his parents. He was part of the growing mission family, eating at the communal table and joining with other children in mission life. As with all other mission family members, he was encouraged to become a fluent [[Bengali language|Bengali]] speaker.

Meanwhile, the [[Church Mission Society|Missionary Society]] had begun sending more missionaries to India. The first to arrive was John Fountain, who arrived in Mudnabatty and began a teaching school. He was followed by [[William Ward (missionary)|William Ward]], a printer; David Brunsdon, one of Marshman's students; and William Grant, who died three weeks after his arrival.

The spirit of the early community's unity was somewhat broken when new missionaries arrived who were not willing to live in the communal fashion that had developed. One missionary even went as far as to demand "...a separate house, stable and servants." There were also other differences, as the new missionaries found their seniors – particularly Joshua Marshman – to be somewhat dictatorial, assigning them duties which were not to their liking.

In 1800, when she first met them, Marshman was appalled by the neglect in which William Carey looked after his four boys; aged 4, 7, 12 and 15, they were unmannered, undisciplined, and even uneducated. Carey had not spoiled, but rather simply ignored them. Marshman, her husband and their friend the printer William Ward, took the boys in tow. Together they shaped the boys as Carey pampered his botanical specimens, performed his many missionary tasks and journeyed into Calcutta to teach at Fort William College. They offered the boys structure, instruction and companionship. To their credit – and little to Carey's – all four boys went on to useful careers.

At one point, Hannah wrote about Carey, "The good man saw and lamented the evil but was too mild to apply an effectual remedy."

==Serampore College and the Serampore Girls' School==
[[File:Hannah Shepherd Marshman Used Chair - Carey Museum - Serampore College - Hooghly 2017-07-06 0758.jpg|thumb|upright|Hannah used this chair at the Serampore College.]]
On 5 July 1818, [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]], [[Joshua Marshman]] and [[William Ward (missionary)|William Ward]] issued a prospectus (written by Marshman) for a proposed new "College for the instruction of Asiatic, Christian, and other youth in Eastern literature and European science". Thus was born [[Serampore College]] – which still continues to this day.

Hannah went on to found the local girls' school.

==Death and memorial==
[[File:Joshua Marshman grave plaque.jpg|thumb|upright|left]]
Hannah Marshman died in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/obit/#hmarshmanobit Bengal Obituary] (1848)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following inscription to her memory is placed in the Mission Chapel at Serampore: "In Memory of Hannah Marshman, widow of Joshua Marshman, D. D. the last surviving Member of the Mission Family at Serampore, she arrived in this settlement in October 1799, and opened a seminary to aid in the support of the Mission in May 1800, after having consecrated her life and property to the promotion of this sacred cause and exhibited an example of humble piety and energetic benevolence for forty-seven years. She died at the age of eighty, March 5, 1847."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7289">The '''IBM 1500 instructional system''' was introduced by [[IBM]] on March 31, 1966, and its primary purpose was to implement [[E-learning|Computer Assisted Instruction]] (CAI). Based around either an [[IBM 1130]] or an [[IBM 1800]] computer, it supported up to 32 student work stations, each with a variety of [[audiovisual]] capabilities.

Seeded by a research grant in 1964 from the U.S. Department of Education to the Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences at Stanford University, the IBM 1500 CAI system was initially prototyped at the Brentwood Elementary School (Ravenswood City School District) in [[East Palo Alto, California]] by Dr. [[Patrick Suppes]] of Stanford University. The students first used the system in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Suppes, Patrick, 
[http://suppes-corpus.stanford.edu/techreports/IMSSS_174.pdf "Computer-assisted Instruction at Stanford"], Technical Report No.174, May 19, 1971, Psychology and Education series, Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunka1996"&gt;Hunka, Stephen; Buck, George (1996) [http://www.quasar.ualberta.ca/edmedia/readingsnc/Hunkabuck.pdf "The Rise and Fall of CAI at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Education"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608020235/http://www.quasar.ualberta.ca/edmedia/readingsnc/Hunkabuck.pdf |date=2011-06-08 }}. Canadian Journal of Educational Communication, 21(2), 153-170. (also: [http://www.cjlt.ca/index.php/cjlt/issue/view/45 full journal issue])&lt;/ref&gt;

The first production IBM 1500 system was shipped to [[Stanford University]] in August 1967.

Preliminary versions of course materials that educators could use with the IBM 1500 were developed by [[Science Research Associates|Science Research Associates, Inc.]], an IBM subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/dpd50/dpd50_chronology3.html "IBM DPD Chronology"] - IBM Corporation. Cf. 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Most educational programming on the IBM 1500 system was done in the specialized computer programming language called ''Coursewriter''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=3028&amp;language=CourseWriter CourseWriter article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306204451/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=3028&amp;language=CourseWriter |date=2010-03-06 }} - History of Programming Languages site&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBM 1500 system and its learning environment was a modern step in the [[history of virtual learning environments]].&lt;ref name="Buck"&gt;Buck, George; Hunka, Steve, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=366508 "Development of the IBM 1500 Computer-Assisted Instructional System"], ''IEEE Annals of the History of Computing'', vol. 17, no. 1, pp. 19-31, Spring, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Buck and Hunka wrote in their 1995 retrospective and historical paper that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The IBM 1500 Instructional System was the only commercial system produced by a single manufacturer that had an integrated student terminal configuration providing a keyboard and light pen response mode, CRT-based graphics, audio, and static film projection. Experimental instructional systems had been developed by IBM prior to a prototype version of the 1500 Instructional System, which was tested at Stanford University. A production version of the 1500 System with changes in the CPU and the audio system and having the capability to run a maximum of 32 student stations was installed in over 30 sites beginning in the late 1960s. IBM's commitment to the development of this system was extensive but short-lived, as most sites were unable to maintain funding support for the system. In retrospect, the IBM 1500 System had capabilities yet to be supported on the microcomputer systems of the 1990s." &lt;ref name="Buck"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Selected educational applications ==
The Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) Division of the U.S. Army Signal Center and School (USASCS) at [[Fort Monmouth|Fort Monmouth, New Jersey]] evaluated CAI's success in teaching basic electronics by using material presented in the tutorial mode on the IBM 1500 System, utilizing the IBM Coursewriter language, an IBM 1510 Display Console, and an IBM 1512 Image Projector.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Indiana University Bloomington''' ('''IU Bloomington''', '''IU''', or simply '''Indiana''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Carnegie Classifications Institution Profile"/&gt; It is the flagship institution of the [[Indiana University system]] and, with over 40,000 students, its largest university.&lt;ref name="iub"/&gt;

Indiana University is one of America's "[[Public Ivy]]" universities, which denotes public universities that provide a quality of education comparable with the [[Ivy League]].&lt;ref name="publicivy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Howard R.|title=The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities|year=2001|publisher=Cliff Street Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0060934590|edition=1st|author2=Greene, Matthew W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of academics and other criteria, it consistently ranks in the top 100 national universities in the U.S. and among the top 50 public universities. It is a member of the [[Association of American Universities]] and has numerous schools and programs, including the [[Jacobs School of Music]], the [[Indiana University School of Informatics|School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering]], the [[Kelley School of Business]], the [[Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington|School of Public Health]], the School of Nursing, the School of Optometry, the [[Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs|School of Public and Environmental Affairs]], the [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law|Maurer School of Law]], the [[Indiana University School of Education|School of Education]], the Media School, and the School of Global and International Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iub.edu/academic/departments/byschool.shtml|title=Schools|work=Indiana University Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of Fall 2017, 43,710 students attend Indiana University. While 55.1% of the student body was from Indiana, students from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and 165 countries were also enrolled.&lt;ref name="10Factbook"/&gt; {{as of|2018}}, the average ACT score is a 28 and a SAT score of 1276.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IU Class Profile|url=https://admissions.indiana.edu/education/class-profile.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is home to an extensive student life program, with more than 750 student organizations on campus and with around 17 percent of undergraduates joining the [[Greek system]].&lt;ref name="Greek Organizations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iub.edu/student/activities/greek.shtml|title=Indiana University Bloomington|work=Indiana University Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indiana athletic teams compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and are known as the [[Indiana Hoosiers]]. The university is a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]; since it does not have a mascot, all teams are known simply as "Hoosiers".

Indiana's faculty, staff, and alumni include nine [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates]], 17 [[Rhodes Scholar]]s, 17 [[Marshall Scholars]], and five [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellows]].

===Early years===
Indiana's state government in [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]] established Indiana University on January 20, 1820, as the "State Seminary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology of Indiana University History|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=February 12, 2016|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~libarch/iuchron/iuchron.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in 1822 at what is now called [[Seminary Square Park]] near the intersection of Second Street and College Avenue. The first professor was [[Baynard Rush Hall]], a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister who taught all of the classes in 1825–27. In the first year, he taught twelve students and was paid $250. Hall was a [[Classics|classicist]] who focused on Greek and Latin and believed that the study of classical philosophy and languages formed the basis of the best education.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D. Clark, ''Indiana University Midwestern Pioneer: The Early Years''. Vol. 1. pp 9, 33&lt;/ref&gt; The first class graduated in 1830. From 1820 to 1889 a legal-political battle was fought between IU and [[Vincennes University]] as to which was the legitimate state university.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. McMains, "The Indiana Seminary Charter of 1820," ''Indiana Magazine of History'' (2010) 106#4 pp 356-380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D. Clark, ''Indiana University: Vol. I: The Early Years'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:IUSampleGates.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|left|alt=The Sample Gates |The Sample Gates, the main entrance to the Indiana University Bloomington Campus]]

In 1829, [[Andrew Wylie (IU)|Andrew Wylie]] became the first president, serving until his death in 1851. The school's name was changed to "Indiana College" in 1829, and to "Indiana University" in 1839. Wylie and David Maxwell, president of the board of trustees, were devout Presbyterians. They spoke of the nonsectarian status of the school but generally hired fellow Presbyterians. Presidents and professors were expected to set a moral example for their charges. After six ministers in a row, the first non-clergyman to become president was the young biology professor [[David Starr Jordan]], in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle Williams, "Andrew Wylie and Religion at Indiana University, 1824–1851: Nonsectarianism and Democracy," ''Indiana Magazine of History'' (2003) 99#1 pp 3-24&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan followed [[Baptists|Baptist]] theologian [[Lemuel Moss]], who resigned after a scandal broke regarding his involvement with a female professor.

Jordan (president 1884–1891) improved the university's finances and public image, doubled its enrollment, and instituted an elective system along the lines of his alma mater, [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Ramsey, "Building A 'Real' University in the Woodlands of Indiana: The Jordan Administration, 1885–1891," ''American Educational History Journal'' (2004) 31#1 pp 20-28&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan became president of [[Stanford University]] in June 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/CDGA.A-L/jordan.htm|title=David Starr Jordan Collected Papers (CDG-A), Swarthmore College Peace Collection|work=swarthmore.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth of the college was slow. In 1851, IU had nearly a hundred students and seven professors. IU admitted its first woman student, Sarah Parke Morrison, in 1867, making IU [[List of mixed-sex colleges and universities in the United States|the fourth public university to admit women on an equal basis with men]]. Morrison went on to become the first female professor at IU in 1873.

Mathematician [[Joseph Swain (academic)|Joseph Swain]] was IU's first Hoosier-born president, 1893 to 1902. He established Kirkwood Hall in 1894; a gymnasium for men in 1896, which later was named [[Assembly Hall (Bloomington)|Assembly Hall]]; and [[Kirkwood Observatory]] in 1900. He began construction for Science Hall in 1901. During his presidency, student enrollment increased from 524 to 1,285.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Swain|title=Inaugural Address of Joseph Swain: President Indiana University, Delivered June 14, 1893, at the Annual Commencement of Indiana University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLoYgnv5vUQC|year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Indiana University|title=Indiana University, 1820–1920: Centennial Memorial Volume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-7p6zqXkgwC&amp;pg=PA330|year=1921|publisher=Indiana university|pages=330–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morrison Hall Indiana University Bloomington 1942 LOC gsc.5a08774.jpg|thumb|Morrison Hall in June 1942]]
In 1883, IU awarded its first [[Ph.D]]. and played its first intercollegiate sport (baseball), prefiguring the school's future status as a major research institution and a power in collegiate athletics. But another incident that year was of more immediate concern: the original campus in Seminary Square burned to the ground. The college was rebuilt between 1884 and 1908 at the far eastern edge of Bloomington. (Today, the city has expanded eastward, and the "new" campus is once again in the midst of the city.) One challenge was that Bloomington's limited water supply was inadequate for its population of 12,000 and could not handle university expansion. The University commissioned a study that led to building a [[Griffy Lake#University Lake|reservoir]] for its own use.&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Maxwel, "Impounded water in Bloomington, Ind.," ''Municipal and county engineering: design, construction, maintenance, and operation of all public works'' (Jan 1921) 60#1 pp
159–161 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZRNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA160 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
In 1902, IU enrolled 1203 undergraduates; all but 65 were Hoosiers. There were 82 graduate students including ten from out-of-state. The curriculum emphasized the classics, as befitted a gentleman, and stood in contrast to the service-oriented curriculum at [[Purdue University|Purdue]], which presented itself as of direct benefit to farmers, industrialists, and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D. Clark, ''Indiana University'' 2:5, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The first extension office of IU was opened in Indianapolis in 1916. In 1920/1921 the [[Jacobs School of Music|School of Music]] and the School of Commerce and Finance (what later became the [[Kelley School of Business]]) were opened. In the 1940s Indiana University opened extension campuses in [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]] and [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]]. The controversial [[Kinsey Institute]] for sexual research was established in 1945.

During the [[Great Depression]], Indiana University fared much better than most state schools thanks to the entrepreneurship of its young president [[Herman Wells]]. He collaborated with [[Frederick L. Hovde]], the president of IU's cross state rival, Purdue; together they approached the Indiana delegation to Congress, indicating their highest priorities. For Wells, it was to build a world-class music school, replacing dilapidated facilities. As a result of these efforts, the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) built one of finest facilities in the country. He added matching funds from the state legislature, and opened a full-scale fund-raising campaign among alumni and the business community. In 1942, Wells reported that "The past five years have been the greatest single period of expansion in the physical plant of the University in its entire history. In this period 15 new buildings have been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Herman B Wells, ''Being Lucky'' (1980), pp 155-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D Clark, ''Indiana University: Midwestern Pioneer volume 3: Years of Fulfillment'' (1977), p 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the IU student body elected [[Thomas I. Atkins|Thomas Atkins]], an African-American from [[Elkhart, Indiana]], to the position of president of the student body. A throng of white students protested the result by parading around campus waving Confederate flags and allegedly blamed Atkins' victory on a "bunch of beatniks." When the protesters approached the female dormitory on campus, they were apparently met with "a barrage of cosmetic bottles, old shoes and other objects."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Student president wins by 45 votes|last = |first = |date = April 16, 1960|journal = The Baltimore Afro-American|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The Indiana University Bloomington campus of {{convert|1933|acre|km2}} includes abundant green space and historic buildings dating to the university's reconstruction in the late nineteenth century. In 2011, ''[[Travel+Leisure]]'' listed the University as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/17 "America's most beautiful college campuses", ''Travel+Leisure'' (September, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; The campus rests on a bed of [[Indiana Limestone]], specifically [[Salem Limestone]] and [[Harrodsburg Limestone]], with outcroppings of [[St. Louis Limestone]].

The "Jordan River" is a stream flowing through the center of campus. A section of Bloomington's [[Clear Creek (Salt Creek)|Clear Creek]],&lt;ref name=city&gt;[http://bloomington.in.gov/documents/viewDocument.php?document_id=3011#streams Water Basics: Stream] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916035852/http://bloomington.in.gov/documents/viewDocument.php?document_id=3011 |date=September 16, 2012 }} (City of Bloomington)&lt;/ref&gt;
it is named for [[David Starr Jordan]], [[Darwinism|Darwinist]], [[ichthyologist]], and president of IU, later, of [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark Kimberling, [http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/bstud/jordanland.html David Starr Jordan Landmarks on the campus of Indiana University, Bloomington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805182602/http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/bstud/jordanland.html |date=August 5, 2012 }}, with a further source given as the ''Indiana Alumni Magazine'' [vol. 18 (June 1956) page 7].&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomington was ranked 5th best city for educated millennials by [[Business Insider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Best Small Cities for Educated Millennials|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-small-cities-for-recent-college-graduates-2015-5|publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''College Ranker'' listed Bloomington as #6 Best College Town to Live in Forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best College Towns to Live in Forever|url=http://www.collegeranker.com/features/best-college-towns/|publisher=College Ranker}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lumosity]] and [[VentureBeat]] both rank Bloomington as the 7th smartest city in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lumosity Ranks "Smartest" and "Dumbest" Cities in America|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Lumosity+Ranks+Smartest+and+Dumbest+Cities+in+America/article31887.htm|publisher=Daily Tech|access-date=September 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911205150/http://www.dailytech.com/Lumosity+Ranks+Smartest+and+Dumbest+Cities+in+America/article31887.htm|archive-date=September 11, 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=These are the 100 smartest cities in America (study)|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/06/25/smartest-cities-in-america/|publisher=Venture Beat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomington has been ranked the 4th "Gayest (per-capita) City in America" by [[Advocate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gayest Cities in America|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122867548|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the campus's buildings, especially the older central buildings, are made from [[Indiana Limestone]] quarried locally. The [[Works Progress Administration]] built much of the campus's core during the [[Great Depression]]. Many of the campus's buildings were built and most of its land acquired during the 1950s and 1960s when first soldiers attending under the [[GI Bill]] and then the [[baby boom]] swelled the university's enrollment from 5,403 in 1940 to 30,368 in 1970. Some buildings on campus underwent similar expansion. As additions were constructed by building onto the outside of existing buildings, exterior surfaces were incorporated into their new interiors, making this expansion clearly visible in the affected buildings' architecture. The Chemistry and Biology buildings serve as examples, where two of the interior walls of the latter's library are clearly constructed as limestone exteriors. The [[Bryan House (Bloomington, Indiana)|Bryan House]] is the traditional on-campus home of the university president.

Nine of the oldest buildings are included in a national [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] known as '''The Old Crescent'''. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=nris /&gt; They are the [[Collegiate Gothic]] style Student Service Building (1906–1908); Indiana University Museum (1905); [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style Maxwell Building (1890, 1907–1908); Owen Hall (1885); Wylie Hall (1885); Kirkwood Hall (1895); Lindley Hall (1903); [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style Rose Well House (1908); and Kirkwood Observatory (1900).&lt;ref name="SHAARD"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/welcome.html |title=Indiana State Historic Architectural and Archaeological Research Database (SHAARD) |publisher=Department of Natural Resources, Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology |format=Searchable database|accessdate=May 1, 2016}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web |url=https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/r/1d2d6/N/Old_Crescent_Monroe_CO_Nom.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: The Old Crescent |accessdate=May 1, 2016 |author=Daniel F.

The [[Indiana University Cinema]] opened in January 2011 in the former University Theatre building, which was built in the 1930s.

The Bloomington campus also has a biology research greenhouse in Jordan Hall that is open to the public, one of the highlights of which is a corpse flower (''[[Amorphophallus titanum]]'') named Wally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.limestonepostmagazine.com/6-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-jordan-greenhouses/|title=6 Things You Didn't Know About the Jordan Greenhouses - Limestone Post Magazine in Bloomington, Indiana|website=www.limestonepostmagazine.com|language=en-US|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/07/30/ius-corpse-flower-bloom/87816310/|title=IU's 'corpse flower' in odoriferous bloom|work=Indianapolis Star|access-date=May 1, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on campus, the [[Kirkwood Observatory]] is open to the public one day a week.

The 1979 movie ''[[Breaking Away]]'' was filmed on location in Bloomington and the IU campus. It also featured a reenactment of the annual [[Little 500]] bicycle race. The IU campus also has trails that many use for biking and running. The trails in Bloomington and nearby areas total nearly {{convert|1200|mi|km}}.

===Indiana Memorial Union===
{{main|Indiana Memorial Union}}
The over {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Indiana Memorial Union]] (IMU) is the second largest student union in the world. In addition to stores and restaurants, it features an eight-story student activities tower (home to the [[Indiana University Student Association]], Indiana Memorial Union Board, and a variety of other student organizations), a 186-room hotel, a 400-seat theatre, a {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Alumni Hall, {{convert|50000|sqft|m2}} of meeting space, and a bowling alley. The IMU houses an outstanding collection of Indiana art including artists from [[Brown County, Indiana|Brown County]], the [[Hoosier Group]], [[Richmond Group]] and others. This collection is the largest public collection of art outside of a museum.

===Athletic facilities===
{{see also|Indiana Hoosiers}}
[[File:Sweetheart Tree.jpg|thumb|Sweetheart tree standing in the courtyard of the Chemistry building at Indiana University Bloomington.]]

Indiana University's athletic facilities are located on campus and are grouped in between East 17th Street, Dunn Street and the [[Indiana State Road 45|IN-45]]/[[Indiana State Road 46|IN-46]] bypass. In the 17,000-seat [[Assembly Hall (Bloomington)|Assembly Hall]] (home to the IU [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] basketball team), there are five [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] banners on display. Cook Hall, [[Memorial Stadium (Indiana)|Memorial Stadium]], [[John Mellencamp Pavilion|Mellencamp Pavilion]], the [[Gladstein Fieldhouse]], the IU Tennis Center, the [[Billy Hayes Track]] and [[Bill Armstrong Stadium]] are all also located within the complex.

===Department of Chemistry===
The Chemistry Department has a great history at Indiana University since the very early days of the college.  Chemistry was first added to the curriculum in 1829 by [[Andrew Wylie (college president)|Andrew Wylie]], IU president at the time (1829-1851).&lt;ref&gt;https://president.iu.edu/about/past-presidents/wylie-andrew.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The first degrees in chemistry were awarded in 1890.  The graduate school at Indiana university wasn’t formally established until 1904 but not soon after, a plan for graduate work in chemistry was underway.  However, the first PhD in chemistry wasn’t granted until 1921.&lt;ref&gt;http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/findingaids/view?doc.view=entire_text&amp;docId=InU-Ar-VAC0279&lt;/ref&gt; 
A crucial event in the history of the Chemistry Department was in 1931, when the construction of a new facility explicitly for chemistry began which led to major growth within the department. Some of the departments most acclaimed and prolific faculty came to the University during this time. 
A major staple to the department is the famous Sweetheart tree &lt;ref&gt;https://www.idsnews.com/article/2018/04/sweetheart-tree-set-for-removal-due-to-years-long-decline&lt;/ref&gt; that has stood outside the Chemistry Building since it was built in 1931.  Even when a major addition to the building was made in the 1980s, architects decided to preserve the beloved tree and build around it. A sad day came in the spring of 2018 when the University announced the famous sweetheart tree was dying and removal was scheduled to begin on April 11. IU intends to plant a new tree in its place once the soil has recovered.

The Indiana University Bloomington Library System supports over twenty libraries and provides access to more than 9.9 million books, 800 databases, 60,000 electronic journal titles, and 815,000 ebooks.&lt;ref name="IU Libraries"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://libraries.indiana.edu/about/administration|title = About IU Libraries|publisher = Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is the 14th largest library in North America by volumes held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nation's Largest Libraries: A Listing By Volumes Held|url=http://www.ala.org/tools/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet22|website=American Library Association|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herman B Wells Library===
IU's [[Herman B Wells]] Library holds more than 4.6 million volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herman B Wells Library|url=https://libraries.indiana.edu/wells|website=Indiana University Libraries|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to a ceremony in June 2005, when it was renamed for IU's former president and chancellor, this building was simply called the Main Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malcomb|first1=Lou|title=Herman B Wells Library|url=http://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/gpd-web/iulibraryhistorysite/hbwells.php|website=History of the IU Libraries|accessdate=July 19, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903233758/http://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/gpd-web/iulibraryhistorysite/hbwells.php|archivedate=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural firm [[Eggers &amp; Higgins]] designed the largely windowless, limestone paneled library, whose construction began in 1966 and was completed in 1969.&lt;ref name="Library history"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graf|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Hardesty|first2=Julie|last3=Homenda|first3=Nick|title=History of the Herman B Wells Library|url=http://www.iub.edu/~iulibhis/exhibits/show/wellslibrary|website=Indiana University|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building contains eleven floors in the East Tower (research collection) and five floors in the West Tower (the undergraduate core collection). In 2014 the first floors of both towers were renovated and reintroduced as the Learning Commons and Scholars' Commons. The library is also home to [[Indiana University Press]] and the University Graduate School. It is the former home of the Information and Library Science Department, which is now hosted by Luddy Hall.

An oft-repeated [[urban legend]] holds that the library is sinking because when it was built, engineers failed to take into account the weight of all the books that would occupy the building. An article in the [[Indiana Daily Student]] newspaper debunks this myth, stating, among other things, that the building rests on a 94&amp;nbsp;ft (28.6 m) thick [[limestone]] bedrock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hogan|first1=Madison|title=Libraries provide countless resources for the public|url=http://www.idsnews.com/article/2014/10/libraries-provide-countless-resources-for-the-pubic|website=Indiana Daily Student|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Lilly Library is the [[Ruth E. Adomeit]] collection of miniature books, one of the world's largest.&lt;ref name="batcon"/&gt; Among the collection are rare miniature books such as "From Morn Till Eve", a miniature book that presents biblical quotations in a devotional form, with one phrase for each morning and evening of a month. The [[Online Computer Library Center]] (OCLC) had listed that, "the only known copy as being in the collection of famed miniature book collector Ruth E. Adomeit",&lt;ref name="abaa"/&gt; which is now in the Lilly Library.

===Fine Arts Library===
IU's first Fine Arts Library was established in the late 1930s as part of the Departmental office on the second floor, east wing of the University Library which was then in Franklin Hall. In 1941, two important events occurred: art historian Henry Radford Hope became chairman of the Fine Arts Department in the Fall and the Fine Arts Center was created by remodeling Mitchell Hall Annex. The Fine Arts Library moved into IU Art Museum designed by I.M. Pei in August 1981. This location was closed for renovations to the museum in spring 2017. All fine arts materials are currently located on the 9th floor of the Herman B Wells Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libraries.indiana.edu/access-iu-libraries-fine-arts-materials |title=Service continues: Access IU Libraries' fine arts materials &amp;#124; Indiana University Libraries |publisher=Libraries.indiana.edu |date=May 22, 2017 |accessdate=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William and Gayle Cook Music Library===
The William and Gayle Cook Music Library, recognized as one of the largest academic music libraries in the world, serves the Jacobs School of Music and the Bloomington Campus of Indiana University. It occupies a four-floor, 55,000 square-foot facility in a wing of the Bess Meshulam Simon Music Library and Recital Center, dedicated in November 1995. The collection comprises over 700,000 catalogued items on 56,733 linear feet of shelves.

The Cook Music Library holds many special collections, including audio and print collections. One notable collection contains items from [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s compositional studio, including items such as clothing, furniture, recordings, books, and awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libraries.indiana.edu/cook-music-library-special-collections |title=Cook Music Library Special Collections |date=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residential Programs and Services Libraries===
Residence Hall Library programs began in the 1930s at Harvard University. By 1978, there were twenty-one institutions with residential library systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ariew|first1=Susan Andriette|title=The Failure of the Open Access Residence Hall Library|journal=College and Research Libraries|date=1978|volume=39|issue=5|pages=372, 380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Indiana University has only one of two residential library programs that still operates. Additionally, Indiana University has continued to expand their residential library system, adding the most recent branch in 2017. There are currently fourteen library branches: Briscoe, Campus View Apartments, Collins LLC, Eigenmann, Forest, Foster, McNutt, Read, Spruce, Teter, Union Street Center, Wells Quad, Wilkie, and Wright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.indiana.edu/libraryservices.cfml|title=Residential Programs and Services|website=RPS Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries are open daily while classes are in session. Previously, half of the branches were considered Movies, Media, and More centers, and only offered DVDs and CDs. In 2018, the decision was made to have all library branches offer books in addition to movies and games. The libraries hire graduate students in Indiana University's Master of Library Science program to act as Center Supervisors, who lead a staff of seven student assistants in staffing the libraries each evening. New material is added to the libraries each week, and any student or staff member of Indiana University is able to check out material using their Crimson Card.

====College of Arts and Sciences====
[[File:StudentBIUB.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Student Building |The Student Building, home of the Departments of Anthropology and Geography]]
The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest of the University's academic divisions and home to more than 40 percent of IU's undergraduates. In addition, the College offers many electives and general education courses for students enrolled in most other schools on campus. There are more than 50 academic departments in the College, encompassing a broad range of disciplines from the traditional (such as Anthropology, Art History, Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Classics, English, Economics, Geography, History, Mathematics, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Religious Studies, and Sociology) to more modern and specialized areas, including Jewish Studies, [[History and Philosophy of Science|History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine]], and International Studies. Through the College, IU also offers instruction in over 50 foreign languages, one of the largest language study offerings at any American university. IU is the only university in the nation that offers a degree in Hungarian (although it was done through the Individualized Major Program) and is the first university in the United States to offer a doctorate in [[Gender Studies]].&lt;ref name="Indiana Creates First Gender Studies Ph.D."/&gt; The Department of Geography has highly recognized programs in climate and environmental change, GIS, human-environment interaction, and human geography. Indiana University is also home to the nation's only degree-granting [[Department of Central Eurasian Studies (Indiana University)|Department of Central Eurasian Studies]]. The university's catalog at one time boasted that a student could study any language from [[Akan language|Akan]] to [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. The College is the parent division for fifteen individual research institutes and holds the distinction of being the only academic division within the university to house autonomous schools (The School of Art + Design, The School of Global and International Studies, and the Media School) within it.

[[File:Indiana-Hoosier-Huddle.jpg|thumb|170px|Basketball players huddle before a game in their candy striped pants.]]
IU's intercollegiate athletics program has a long tradition in several key sports. From its beginnings with baseball in 1867, the Hoosier athletic program has grown to include over 600 male and female student-athletes on 24 varsity teams boasting one of the nation's best overall records. Sports sponsored by the university include [[American football|football]], men's [[basketball]], women's [[basketball]], [[cross country running|cross country]] and [[Track and field|track]], [[softball]], [[baseball]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[Sport rowing|rowing]], [[volleyball]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]], and [[College wrestling|wrestling]]

The Hoosiers became a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]] on December 1, 1899. The school's national affiliation is with the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). National team titles (now totaling 26; 25 NCAA, 1 [[AIAW]]) have been won in nine men's sports and one women's sport (tennis), topped by a record-setting six straight men's swimming &amp; diving titles, eight men's [[soccer]] crowns and five titles in men's [[basketball]]. Indiana University's men's basketball team is one of the most decorated programs in the nation, having won five national championships. Indiana student-athletes have won 133 NCAA individual titles, including 79 in men's swimming and diving and 31 in men's [[track and field]]. In addition, IU teams have won or shared 157 [[Big Ten Conference]] championships.

The IU athletics endowment is $42 million, the largest in the [[Big Ten Conference]].&lt;ref name="IU Athletics receives single largest gift in its history"/&gt; The Varsity Club, which is the fundraising arm of the Athletics Department, drew a record $11.5 million in gifts and pledges in the fiscal year 2004–05. In addition, overall annual giving has increased 8.3% in the last year and 44.8 percent in the last three years.

In addition to its rich tradition in intervarsity sports, IU also boasts a strong reputation in many non-varsity sports. Many of these "club" teams, especially those in [[ice hockey]] and [[rugby union]], have achieved a great deal of success in intercollegiate competition. [[Hurling]] has also become more popular, with the Indiana University Hurling Club becoming the first American national champions in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indiana University win first ever National Collegiate Hurling Championship in the U.S.|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/usa/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=149684|accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consistent success of these athletic clubs has several times led the university to establish varsity programs in sports in which there had previously not been a team for NCAA intervarsity competition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12707">The '''Knowledge Master Open''' (commonly known as '''Knowledge Masters''' or '''KMO''') was a computer-based semiannual worldwide academic competition produced by [[Academic Hallmarks]]. During KMO competitions, teams of students from many [[school]]s earned points by answering multiple-choice questions quickly and accurately. The questions included fifteen subject areas: American history, world history, government, recent events, economics &amp; law, geography, literature, English, math, physical science, biology, earth science, health &amp; psychology, fine arts, and useless trivia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2297181 Oak Park among world leaders in competition]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Trading Markets - Press Release'', April 29, 2009 - accessed May 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

The competition started in 1983 with 74 schools. In 2009, there were about 45,000 participants from over 3,000 high schools and middle schools in the U.S. and other countries.  The last contest occurred in April 2013.  Over the 30 years of KMO competition, more than 2.4 million students participated.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://hhslifeandtimes.blogspot.com/2009/01/strong-showing-in-knowledge-master-open.html Strong Showing in the Knowledge Master Open], ''HHS Life and Times'', January 5, 2009 - accessed May 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There were five levels of competition. 5th and 6th grade contests were held in January and March and consisted of 100 questions. On the other hand, middle school (up to grade 8), junior high (up to grade 9), and high school (up to grade 12) contests were held in December and April and consisted of 200 questions.

== Rules and scoring ==
Each participating school received a password-protected disk (originally a floppy disk, later a CD-ROM) containing the contest questions. Only the first use of the password would generate a valid score report for submission to Academic Hallmarks. Team size was left to each individual school's discretion.

All questions were multiple-choice, with a maximum value of 10 points each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/story/7000 It's Academic Team to compete in Knowledge Master Open], ''Silver Chips Online'', December 6, 2006 - accessed May 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Each question and its category were displayed on screen, with five choices and a 60-second timer. A correct answer on the first try awarded five points, with up to five bonus points depending on the response time. If time expired or an incorrect response was given, the timer was reset to 60 seconds and the team was given a second chance to answer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/annarbornews/index.ssf?/base/news-31/1237819268158960.xml&amp;coll=2 Students prep for a quiz they like] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053132/http://www.mlive.com/news/annarbornews/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-31%2F1237819268158960.xml&amp;coll=2 |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''Ann Arbor News'', March 23, 2009 - accessed May 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Two points were awarded for a correct second-chance response, with no bonus.

Bonus points were awarded for correct first-try answers as follows:

Teams could take up to three 5-minute breaks during the contest. They could use pencil and paper, but no other resources such as calculators or reference books, and assistance from coaches or spectators was not allowed.

Once a particular contest was over, the participating schools could use a second password to unlock the questions for unlimited use in practice sessions.

From 2011 he was the associate artistic director of the [[Paris Opera Ballet]] and a [[ballet master]] with the company from 2005 to 2014&lt;ref&gt;.
Since January 2017, he is the artistic director of the [[Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Moscow Academic Music Theatre|Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5297">The '''Lemma Senbet Fund''' is a [[student managed investments]] fund offered as a limited-enrollment &lt;ref name="fund_launch"/&gt; year-round [[experiential learning]] course to top tier&lt;ref name="the_street"/&gt; [[undergraduate students]] from the [[Robert H. Smith School of Business]] at the [[University of Maryland]] (UMD).

==Founding==

The fund, named for [[Lemma Wolde Senbet]], the William E. Mayer Chair Professor of Finance at the Smith School of the University of Maryland, was founded in 2006 with initial capital of $50,000 from the school's endowment fund.&lt;ref name=fund_launch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://scholar.rhsmith.umd.edu/lsenbet/home
|title=Lemma W. Senbet The William E. Mayer Chair Professor of Finance, Director of Center for Financial Policy
|publisher=University of Maryland
|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diamondback_interview"/&gt;

==Governance structure==

The investment management team consists of 12 undergraduate students chosen through an interview and presentation process designed to simulate the hiring process of [[investment banking]] firms.&lt;ref name="diamondback_interview"/&gt; The team consists of 2 [[portfolio managers]] and 10 [[equity analyst]]s each dedicated to a specific industry sector: [[consumer products]] (discretionary), consumer products (staples), [[energy industry|energy]], [[financial services]], [[healthcare industry|healthcare]], [[Secondary sector|industrials]], [[information technology]], materials, [[telecommunications industry|telecommunications]], and [[utilities]]. Each sector analyst pitches approximately 4 stocks per year, and must persuade all 12 members (not just a majority) of the investment team to buy.&lt;ref name="washington_post"/&gt; The student investment management team uses Bloomberg Professional Services running on [[Bloomberg Terminal]]s to conduct in-depth [[financial analysis]], manage the asset portfolio, and execute security trades.&lt;ref name=bloomberg_terminals/&gt; The students are unpaid, and do not share in the fund gains nor receive distributions.

==Investment strategy==

The long-term performance goal of the Lemma Senbet Fund is to outpace appreciation of the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]] on a risk-adjusted basis. Historically, the fund has adopted a top-down investment approach that is driven by [[Economic indicator]]s, then Industry trends, and finally individual Company perfornance (EIC). Most asset instruments are long equity positions.&lt;ref name="the_street"/&gt; Specific stock selections are based on a combination of [[fundamental analysis]] and [[technical analysis]] valuation techniques under the [[Growth at a Reasonable Price]] (GARP) model.&lt;ref name=annual_report/&gt;

==Fund growth==

Since founding in 2006, even after annual distributions the Lemma Senbet Fund has grown 18-fold from $50,000 &lt;ref name=fund_launch/&gt; to $911,032 (fiscal year ended March 31, 2017).&lt;ref name=annual_report/&gt;

==Fund Distributions==

The Lemma Senbet fund pays a 5% distribution to the UMD Deans Office each year. In 2017, this distribution amounted to $37,729.&lt;ref name=annual_report/&gt;

'''''Microjazz''''' is a long-running series of [[sheet music]] publications by [[New Zealand]]-born [[United Kingdom|British]] pianist and composer [[Christopher Norton]]. The series is published by [[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]].
Based on classical technique yet using popular contemporary styles such as [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[rock 'n' roll]] and [[funk]], ''Microjazz'' aims to "develop musicianship and technique through the familiar sounds and styles of popular music". The series has established itself as a leading educational music series around the world, and has expanded over 20 years to include music for all of the major instruments with piano, ensemble books and midi file backings. It is now the biggest selling music series for Boosey &amp; Hawkes, with over a million sales to date.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5093">The '''National Medical Challenge Bowl''' is a competition coordinated by Max Yakimov from the Student Academy of the [[American Academy of Physician Assistants]].

The competition is held during the AAPA's Annual PA Conference and the event is organized in a medical [[quiz bowl]]-style. Forty-eight teams, with three PA students to a team, compete to answer medical-related questions.  Questions are asked on a variety of subjects including [[Medical diagnosis|physical diagnosis]], [[microbiology]], [[anatomy]], [[OB/GYN]], [[pulmonary]], [[cardiology]], [[primary care]], [[emergency medicine]], and [[surgery]].   Only AAPA student members currently enrolled in an accredited [[Physician Assistant]] program which has a registered student society are eligible to participate.

==History==
The Challenge Bowl started at the 1991 AAPA Annual Conference in [[San Francisco, CA]].  It has been held as an annual event at the conference every year since.  Several states have followed this tradition and hold annual state competitions which are molded after the same format as the national competition.  The competition is one of the most anticipated events at every Annual Conference.  Several students of the various schools participating often attend the event and it is also very popular among the participants of the Conference as they go to cheer on their [[alma mater]].

==Format and Rules of Competition==
Teams play in a round-robin format; with preliminary rounds, semi-final rounds and one final round.&lt;br /&gt;
The moderator reads the questions, the first team to buzz in is acknowledged by the moderator and permitted 10 seconds to answer.

The moderator does not complete the question if a team buzzes in before the full question is read.&lt;br /&gt;
If the team that buzzes in answers incorrectly, the moderator re-reads the question and then allows other team(s) an opportunity to respond. Ten seconds are allowed for response and only one response per team is accepted after a team has buzzed in.

The team with the most points at the end of the round advances to the next round. The team with the most points at the end of the final round is declared the winner. In the event of a tie between the two highest scoring teams in the round, a "sudden death" playoff is held and the team to correctly answer a question wins the round. If the team answers incorrectly, the other team wins.

Ten points are awarded for each question answered correctly. Ten points are deducted for each incorrect response. If a team buzzes in and then fails to answer, it is counted as an incorrect response.&lt;br /&gt;
Team members must speak loudly and clearly into the microphone. If the moderator questions the pronunciation of an answer, they may request the team to spell the word in question. If the spelling is correct, points are awarded. If the pronunciation and spelling are ruled incorrect, points are deducted.

'''Popular history''' is a broad and somewhat ill-defined [[genre]] of [[historiography]] that takes a popular approach, aims at a wide readership, and usually emphasizes [[narrative]], [[Personality type|personality]] and vivid detail over scholarly analysis. The term is used in contradistinction to professional academic or scholarly history writing which is usually more specialized and technical and, thus, less accessible to the general reader.

Some popular historians are without academic affiliation while others are academics, or former academics, that have (according to one writer) "become somehow abstracted from the academic arena, becoming cultural commentators".&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, Jerome (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hexpdOj8t80C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22popular+historian%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yvNFz2kvUh&amp;sig=io51iX8gENuqr0egzP2J9JpLwGM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZBSxSpqCKYmf8Qbh7MHCDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22popular%20historian%22&amp;f=false ''Consuming History: Historians and Heritage in Contemporary Popular Culture''], [[Routledge]], pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Many worked as journalists, perhaps after taking an initial degree in history.

Popular historians may become nationally renowned or best-selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as "public historians". Many authors of "official histories" and "authorized biographies" would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures.

Popular historians aim to appear on the "general lists" of general publishers, rather than the [[university press]]es that have dominated [[academic publishing]] in recent years. Increasingly, popular historians have taken to television where they are able, often accompanying a series of documentaries with a [[tie-in]] book.

==Examples==
Recent examples of American popular historians with academic affiliations include [[Stephen Ambrose]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] and [[Pauline Maier]]. Non-academics include [[Bruce Catton]], [[Shelby Foote]], [[David McCullough]], [[Daniel Boorstin]] and [[Barbara Tuchman]].

Recent examples of British popular historians who are also academics include [[Niall Ferguson]], [[Christopher Hibbert]] and [[Simon Schama]], and – from a previous generation – [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[A. J. P. Taylor]] (an early pioneer of history on television) and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. Much of [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]'s output was also directed at a popular audience.

[[John Julius Norwich]], [[Nirad Chaudhuri]], [[Ramchandra Guha]], [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]] and [[Tariq Ali]] are popular historians who have never been academics.

In 1972, he resigned his position as Founding Chair of the [[Cal Poly Pomona College of Environmental Design|Department of Architecture]] at [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]] and along with a group of faculty and students, started what eventually came to be known as the [[Southern California Institute of Architecture]] (SCI-Arc).

Kappe is still actively involved in architectural theory and practice, particularly in the areas of sustainability and the prefabrication of residences.

==Career==
Ray Kappe was born in [[Minneapolis]] as the son of Romanian immigrants. He attended high school in [[Los Angeles]]. He studied for a single semester at [[UCLA]] in 1945 before being drafted in into the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, where he served as a topographical surveying instructor. After his discharge he attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and earned a B.Arch degree in 1951.&lt;ref name=GettyBio /&gt;

==Archive==
The Ray Kappe Archive is housed at the [[Getty Research Institute]] and contains all of his drawings, models, and papers, offering comprehensive coverage of his long and varied career.&lt;ref name="Ray Kappe Archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Kappe papers, 1954-2007|url=http://archives2.getty.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/2008.M.36/2008.M.36.xml;chunk.id=scopecontent_1;brand=default|publisher=The Getty Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
The [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series [[Californication (TV series)|Californication]] features one of Kappe's projects, the Benton House, as a major plot point in Episode Seven, "Girls Interrupted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

The broadcast of [[Children's television series|children's programming]] by [[terrestrial television]] stations in the United States is regulated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), under regulations colloquially referred to as the '''Children's Television Act''' ('''CTA'''), the '''E/I''' rules, or the '''Kid Vid''' rules.&lt;ref name="rbr-kidvid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vty-future"/&gt; Since 1997, all full-power and [[Class A television service|Class A low-power]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/05/10/00-11481/establishment-of-a-class-a-tv-service|title=Establishment of a Class A TV Service|date=May 10, 2000|work=Federal Register|access-date=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; television stations have been required to broadcast at least three hours (or more if they operate [[digital subchannel]]s) per-week of programs that are specifically designed to meet the '''[[Educational television|educational]] and informative''' ('''E/I''') needs of children aged 16 and younger. There are also regulations on advertising in broadcast and cable television programming targeting children 12 and younger, including limits on ad time, and prohibitions on advertising of products related to the program currently airing.

Early regulations on educational programming were implemented by the FCC in 1991, as ordered by the '''Children's Television Act'''—an [[Act of Congress]] passed in 1990. They included a requirement for television stations to document their broadcasting of programs which "[further] the positive development of children 16 years of age and under in any respect, including the child's intellectual/cognitive or social/emotional needs", and a requirement for the FCC to use this as a factor in license renewals. Stricter regulations were implemented in 1997, requiring all stations to broadcast at least 3 hours of programming per-week that is designed to educate and inform viewers aged 16 and younger, and introducing requirements regarding on-air identification of these programs, and more stringent reporting requirements.

The E/I regulations had a major impact on U.S. television; the [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] market was bolstered by demand for compliant educational programming, while the [[Saturday morning cartoon]] [[Programming block|blocks]] traditionally aired by major networks began to increase their focus on educational children's programming. They were one of several factors that contributed to the decline of networked Saturday morning blocks, alongside the growth of cable channels (such as [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Nickelodeon]]) and other platforms serving youth demographics—which were not subject to the rule. By the 2010s, the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three networks]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] had revamped their Saturday morning blocks to focus on [[factual television|factual]] programs aimed towards teens (which, additionally, excluded them from the restrictions on advertising load), with the majority having leased the airtime to the distributor [[Litton Entertainment]]. In 2014, [[The CW]] discontinued the last networked Saturday-morning block to still feature non-educational programming, in favor of another Litton-run block.

The educational programming regulations have faced mixed reception. There have historically been concerns over whether these mandates constitute a violation of broadcasters' rights to free speech. The FCC's initial regulations faced criticism for being too broad in its definition of children's educational programming, with stations attempting to various classify non-educational programs as containing educational elements. The regulations have been described by current FCC commissioner [[Michael O'Rielly]] as "onerous" and outdated due to the cable and [[new media]] platforms that have emerged since their introduction.&lt;ref name="vty-future"/&gt;

==Background ==
Concern over the impact that television had on children began when television was still a new entertainment medium. During the 1950s, many individuals, particularly parents, asked their legislators to do something about the potential effects of television viewing on young people. Academic research was initiated since this time to monitor, analyze and explain the relationships between television and children, although the impact of television on academic performance continues to be debated in scholarly research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first attempt to address these concerns were during [[United States Congress|Congressional]] hearings in 1952 that addressed violence. Besides Congress, there were government commissions that also pursued this agenda. Included in these discussions were the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), the [[Federal Trade Commission]], and advocacy groups formed by concerned citizens. The FCC intended to change a number of policies regarding children's programming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research demonstrated that young children had difficulty distinguishing between the program they were watching, and [[Television advertisement|commercials]] broadcast during them. Most children had little or no understanding of the persuasive intent of commercials, and as such, were highly vulnerable to claims and appeals by advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Young Minds and Marketplace Values: Issues in Children's Television Advertising|author=Dale Kunkal|author2=Donald Roberts|journal=Social Issues|volume=47|issue=1|pages=57–72|date=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers, especially those related to [[junk food]], were interested in youth as consumers because of their spending power through their parents, their influence, and their [[brand awareness]] as adult consumers in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Food Advertising and Marketing Directed at Children and Adolescents in the US|author=Simone French|author2=Mary Story|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity|volume=1|issue=3|doi=10.1186/1479-5868-1-3|date=February 2004|pmid=15171786|pmc=416565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Advertised Foods on Children's Television|author=Howard L.

== History ==
The lobbying group [[Action for Children's Television]] (ACT), which was founded by activist [[Peggy Charren]], actively campaigned for higher-quality children's programming to be broadcast by television stations. The group was critical of the lack of educational programming on television—believing that it was part of broadcasters' obligations to serve the [[public interest]], and also acknowledging programs they felt were meant solely as a promotional tool for associated toylines (such as ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'' and ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony]]'') rather than legitimate entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollis|first1=Tim|title=Hi there, boys and girls! : America's local children's TV shows|date=2001|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=1578063965|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/columns/how-peggy-charren-outflanked-the-childrens-tv-establishment-1201412528/|title=How Peggy Charren Outflanked the Children’s TV Establishment|last=Lowry|first=Brian|date=January 23, 2015|work=Variety|access-date=July 15, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellations of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Animals, Animals, Animals]]'' and [[CBS]]'s children's newsmagazine ''[[30 Minutes (TV series)|30 Minutes]]'', were cited by ACT as examples of the major networks' decreasing commitment to educational programming.&lt;ref name="nye-captainkangaroo"/&gt; 

In 1982, the [[Reagan administration]]'s FCC chairman [[Mark S. Fowler]] lamented upon CBS's decision to move its long-running children's series ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'', from its historic weekday morning timeslot, to weekends, in order to air an expanded ''[[The Early Show#The CBS Morning News|CBS Morning News]]''.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  At the time, the [[Big Three television networks|big three network]]s scheduled the majority of their children's programming, including cartoons, during [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning lineups]], along with occasional late-afternoon "[[after school special]]s"—anthologies of [[made-for-TV movie]]s focusing on issues affecting youth. ''Captain Kangaroo'' had to compete not only with news-based [[morning show]]s such as ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' (which CBS sought to compete with), but local and syndicated offerings also targeting children.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Fowler was against mandating the broadcast of educational programming by commercial stations, arguing that it was within their [[First Amendment]] rights to choose the programming they wish to broadcast, and adding that "it's too bad ''Captain Kangaroo'' is gone, but the Government should not be issuing directives about what should be on the air." Fowler suggested that, if the FCC felt there was not enough children's programming on television, it could mandate that commercial stations contribute funding to support the production of such programs by [[public television|public]] stations.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The idea was criticized by NBC's vice president as being a "tax" on commercial broadcasting, while ABC argued that commercial television (including networks and their affiliates) was doing a better job at serving children than public broadcasters.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

On the other hand, ''Captain Kangaroo'' creator and host [[Bob Keeshan]] disagreed, arguing that children were "just too important to be left to the networks and their profit motives." Citing the recent ''[[New York v. Ferber]]'' decision, he told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "despite the guarantee of free speech, our children are so precious that the free speech of the [[Child pornography|[child] pornographer]] had to give way to allow us to protect children from exploitation."&lt;ref name="nye-captainkangaroo"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/25/arts/are-children-no-longer-in-the-programming-picture.html|title=Are children no longer in the programming picture?|work=The New York Times|last=Holsendolph|first=Ernest|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No serious action took place until the 1990 enactment of the '''Children's Television Act''', an [[Act of Congress]] which ordered the FCC to implement regulations surrounding programming that serves the educational and informational ([[E/I]]) needs of children, as well as the amount of advertising broadcast during programs aimed towards children. This included that a station's commitment to airing and supporting educational children's programming had to become a factor in license renewals, and that limits had to be imposed on the amount of advertising that can be aired during television programs targeting children. It also called for the [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]] to establish a National Endowment to help support the production of educational children's programming.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Children and Television|url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring03/Wells/history.htm|author=Landrea Wells|publisher=[[University of Florida]]|accessdate=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC met its statutory obligations by introducing new regulations effective October 1, 1991. Television stations and cable providers would be required to maintain and publish summaries of the children's educational programming that they broadcast, defined as "programming that furthers the positive development of children 16 years of age and under in any respect, including the child's intellectual/cognitive or social/emotional needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/1996/fcc96335.htm|title=Policies and Rules Concerning Children's Television Programming, MM Docket No. 93-48|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=FCC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As ordered, commercial time during children's programming was limited to 12 minutes per half-hour on weekdays and 10.5 on weekends, and advertising during children's programs for products associated with the program currently airing ("program-length commercials") or containing "program talent or other identifiable program characteristics" (host-selling)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rostron|first=Allen|date=July 13, 2007|title=Return to Hot Wheels: The FCC, Program-Length Commercials, and the Children's Television Act of 1990|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1000194|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also banned. The rule was intended to prevent children's programs that were [[tie-in]]s with toy franchises (such as, for example, ''[[G.I. Joe]]'') from airing ads for the toys themselves during their associated programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/10/business/the-media-business-fcc-adopts-limits-on-tv-ads-aimed-at-children.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; F.C.C.

The CTA was passed despite objections by the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush administration]], who believed that requiring the broadcast of educational programming by all television stations was a violation of their rights to [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|free speech]]. The restriction on "program-length commercials" was also considered to be too narrow; critics (such as Charren) had demanded that it apply to any program targeted towards children that was primarily designed to promote products associated with them, rather than only applying if advertising for said products were broadcast during the program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 1990 regulations were considered to be ineffective; many stations failed to keep the required records or had any method for accurate recording. More than 25% of television stations in the U.S. failed to record the time, date, or length of programming considered to be educational in content. The FCC did little to regulate these logs up until 1993, but later on, came up with certain rules and regulations such as the [[Watershed (television)|safe harbor]] provision in order to regulate content for younger audiences. Due to the weak definition used (and in particular, the allowance for programs meeting social and emotional needs to possibly be considered educational), many stations attempted to interpret programs not specifically-designed to be educational—such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1989 TV series)|G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Hard Copy]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', and ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''—as containing discussion of social and moral issues that made them "educational".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DC133CF93BA35750C0A965958260|title=Review/Television; For Young Audiences, Reality in the Afternoon|last=O'Connor|first=John J.|date=March 8, 1993|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Children's Television Act: Can Policy Make a Difference|author=Sandra Calvert|author2=Jennifer Kotler|journal=Applied Developmental Psychology|year=2003|issue=24|pages=375–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1996 regulations ===
In 1995, FCC commissioner [[Reed Hundt]] began campaigning for stricter children's educational programming regulations, arguing that broadcasters were not displaying a sufficient commitment to the 1990 regulations. His proposal included that stations be required to air a minimum of three hours of children's educational programming per-week. [[Jeff Bingaman]] issued a letter of support for the proposal, signed by 24 Democratic senators and 1 Republican.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1995/tv/features/nab-fcc-square-off-over-kidvid-99129007/|title=NAB, FCC square off over kidvid|last=Wharton|first=Dennis|date=October 30, 1995|work=Variety|access-date=July 13, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fox Kids]] president [[Margaret Loesch]] denied Hundt's arguments that broadcasters were not following the rules, stating that most [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliates aired an average of four hours of children's educational programming per-week (which already exceeded the proposed minimum).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Edward O. Fritts, president of the [[National Association of Broadcasters]], accused Hundt of being "obsessed" with the proposed quota. In regards to reports that Hundt was struggling to receive FCC majority support for the proposal and was repeatedly "stalling" a final vote, Fritts stated that Hundt was that "acting like a regulatory referee wanting to push the game into [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] even though the final score is lopsided.", and that he "made up his mind long ago that broadcasters were to be castigated on children’s TV, without reservation, and despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary." &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Following a push for support from Congress and the [[Clinton Administration]], the FCC adopted the Children's Programming Report and Order in August 1996. The new regulations were intended to provide clearer regulatory obligations for television stations, and promote public awareness of educational programming offered by television stations. The order and regulations defined core educational programming as programs of at least 30 minutes in length that are "specifically designed" to meet the educational and informative (E/I) needs of children 16 years old and younger. The FCC ordered that by September 1997, all commercial television stations must broadcast at least three hours of such programming per-week, regularly scheduled between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Beginning January 2, 1997, television stations were required to use an "E/I" label to promote these programs on-air and in programming information supplied to [[TV listings]] providers.&lt;ref name="nytnewrules" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newrules2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Commercial stations are also required to compile, publish, and publicize a quarterly Children's Television Programming Report in their [[public file]], detailing the children's educational programming aired during the past quarter, what programs it plans to air during the next, and providing a point of contact for viewer inquiries about the educational programs aired by a station. As they are not under the jurisdiction of the FCC, this regulation does not apply to cable channels.&lt;ref name="nytnewrules"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Mandates Educational TV for Children|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/09/us/us-mandates-educational-tv-for-children.html|author=Lawrie Mifflin|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=16|date=August 9, 1996|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newrules2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Quality Television for Children|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/16/opinion/quality-television-for-children.html?pagewanted=1|newspaper=The New York Times|page=32|date=August 16, 1996|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/02/us/fcc-urged-to-strengthen-children-s-tv.html|title=F.C.C.

=== 2006 changes ===
[[Image:PBS e-i bug2.png|thumb|right|An example E/I "bug", which must be displayed on-screen during core educational programming.]]
In September 2004, the FCC announced revisions to the regulations to account for the then-upcoming [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]]. An additional half-hour of E/I programming must be broadcast for every increment of 28 hours of additional free video programming the station offers via [[digital subchannel]]s. The regulations also stipulate that an "E/I" logo must be [[Digital on-screen graphic|displayed on-screen]] to identify this programming, that a regularly-scheduled E/I program may only be rescheduled 10% of the time, and that if rescheduled or moved to a different multicast channel, the station must announce the new scheduling on-air. The FCC also introduced new rules regarding promotion of websites during children's programming aimed at viewers 12 and younger on broadcast and cable channels; they may only be for pages that do not contain any commercial or e-commerce content, must offer "a substantial amount of bona fide program-related or other noncommercial content", and that pages containing imagery of characters from the program must be "sufficiently separated" from commercial areas of the site.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The implementation of the advertising rules were deferred from February 2005 to January 2006, following concerns by broadcasters over the amount of time given to become compliant.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tvtechnology.com/expertise/fcc-postpones-url-rules-for-childrens-programming-till-next-yearhttps://www.tvtechnology.com/expertise/fcc-postpones-url-rules-for-childrens-programming-till-next-year|title=FCC postpones URL rules for children’s programming till next year|work=TV Technology|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/fccs-ei-bug-lands-109383|title=FCC's E/I Bug Lands|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disney]], [[NBC Universal]], and [[Viacom]] issued a joint filing to the FCC in September 2005 to urge against the "far-reaching, burdensome and expensive" advertising rules, with Disney also suing over the regulations as being a violation of freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/viacom-battles-fcc-childrens-ad-rules-81986/|title=Viacom Battles FCC Children's Ad Rules|work=Adweek|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/05/AR2005100502118.html|title=Kids' Television Rules Face Challenge|last=Mohammed|first=Arshad|date=October 6, 2005|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tvtechnology.com/expertise/fcc-addresses-childrens-programming-obligations-of-digital-television-broadcasters|title=FCC addresses children’s programming obligations of digital television broadcasters|work=TVTechnology|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/12/business/fi-kidvid12|title=Disney Sues to Block Programming Rules|last=Jr|first=Jube Shiver|date=October 12, 2005|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 16, 2005, the FCC chose to delay the new regulation to March 6, 2006, in order to allow time for further discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2006/01/11/18fcc.h25.html|title=FCC Rule Boosts Education on Digital TV|last=Trotter|first=Andrew|website= Education We|language=en-US|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were ultimately implemented in September.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Future ===
Current FCC commissioner [[Michael O'Rielly]] has considered the educational programming regulations to be outdated. Citing the wider variety of platforms available (including cable networks and digital platforms), he stated that "with today's dynamic media marketplace there are very little, if any, additional benefits provided by the Kid Vid rules". O'Rielly also argued that the "onerous" nature of the regulations were also making stations reluctant to air other, more viable programs on Saturday mornings, such as newscasts and sports. In July 2018, the FCC issued proposals regarding changes to the rules, including removing the requirement that a program must be regularly scheduled and at least 30 minutes in length, and providing the option for all of a station's E/I programming to air on a subchannel rather than the main signal.&lt;ref name="vty-future"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/politics/news/fcc-childrens-television-broadcasters-1202871448/|title=FCC Takes First Step Toward Easing Children’s TV Mandates on Broadcasters|last=Johnson|first=Ted|date=July 12, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=July 13, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on programming ==
Following the implementation of the regulations, many television stations began to cut locally-produced children's programs due to budgetary concerns, and largely replaced them with educational programs acquired from the [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] market. Studios such as [[Litton Entertainment]] benefited from the resulting demand.&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Darlington|first1=Abigail|title=Setting the stage: Litton Entertainment to build network of film industry professionals in Charleston|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20140720/PC05/140729994|accessdate=March 8, 2016|work=The Post and Courier|date=July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unintended"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unintended Consequences|author=Andy Levinsky|journal=The Humanist|volume=59|issue=6|date=November–December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Annenberg Foundation]] found that the number of [[television network|network television]] shows deemed to be "highly educational" from 1990 to 1998 fell from 43% to 29%. A research report from [[Georgetown University]] said that one issue contributing to this was that what constituted "educational television" programming was defined too broadly, as programming that was only academic or that covered pro-social issues, for example, counted towards station requirements. Another issue was that traditional ideas of what should be taught to children, such as the [[alphabet]] or number systems, were lost. There was also a reported increase in the amount of programs focusing on social issues. Writers for these programs wrote stories that often were not academically sound for young viewers, because they were not trained in writing for this audience. One show that was an exception to this rule is ''[[The Magic School Bus (TV series)|The Magic School Bus]]'', as it combined effective writing and educational content for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Children's Television Act: Can Policy Make a Difference|author=Sandra Calvert|author2=Jennifer Kotler|journal=Applied Developmental Psychology|year=2003|issue=24|pages=375–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Networks picked up series more often when they were related to a well-known [[popular culture|pop culture]] icon, or could be marketable as toys.&lt;ref name="unintended"/&gt; Owing to the success of [[PBS]]'s ''[[Barney &amp; Friends]]'' from both a critical and commercial standpoint, [[Disney]] and [[Nickelodeon]] saw a greater interest in making preschool programming that was more engaging and had educational value to its target audience. However, they also leveraged techniques designed to bolster the programs as a [[brand]] when merchandised, such as close-up "money shots" of key characters designed to encourage [[brand recognition|recognition]] of them by viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/guilt-free-tv-142559|title=Guilt Free TV|date=2002-11-10|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Saturday morning blocks ===
In the wake of the stricter regulations, the [[Big Three television networks|big three television networks]] began to retool their [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] lineups for the 1997-98 television season in order to include more educational programming. 

[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which had recently been acquired by [[Disney]], introduced [[ABC Kids (United States)|One Saturday Morning]] for the 1997-98 season. It featured a mix of Disney animated series, educational interstitial segments (including one featuring comedian [[Robin Williams]] discussing historical figures as his [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] character from ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''), the new educational series ''[[Science Court]]'', and a flagship wraparound program (''Disney's One Saturday Morning''). ABC stated that four of the block's five hours would branded as E/I programming. One Saturday Morning quickly became the top Saturday morning block in terms of viewership, until competition from [[Fox Kids]] and [[Kids' WB]] (credited to the respective popularity of ''[[Digimon]]'' and ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]'') began to erode its audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/digital/news/abc-hopes-for-virtual-success-1116677612/|title=ABC hopes for virtual success|last=Goldman|first=Michael|date=September 15, 1997|work=Variety|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/abc-disney-kid-block-revamped-1117789555/|title=ABC Disney kid block revamped|last=Schneider|first=Michael|date=November 27, 2000|work=Variety|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/webs-roll-out-season-geared-to-kids-1116678415/|title=Webs roll out season geared to kids|last=Grove|first=Christopher|date=August 29, 1997|work=Variety|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/abc-kids-block-tops-fox-on-saturday-1117470615/|title=ABC kids block tops Fox on Saturday|last=Katz|first=Richard|date=May 8, 1998|work=Variety|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the block was replaced by ABC Kids, which drew from the programming of [[Disney Channel]], [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] (which Disney had recently acquired from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), and [[Toon Disney]].&lt;ref name="variety-kidscheds"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2002/tv/news/kid-skeds-tread-on-joint-strategy-1117873477/|title=Kid skeds tread on joint strategy|last=Bernstein|first=Paula|date=September 29, 2002|work=Variety|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS relaunched its [[CBS Kidshow|Saturday morning block]] for the 1997-98 season as Think CBS Kids, with a focus on live-action educational series such as ''[[The New Ghostwriter Mysteries]]'', [[The Weird Al Show|''The Weird Al Show'']], and ''[[Wheel 2000]]''—a children's version of the game show [[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|''Wheel of Fortune'']]. CBS relaunched the block again the following season as the CBS Kidshow, with a focus on cartoons that were adapted from children's books, and produced by Canadian animation studio [[Nelvana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/the-weird-al-show-the-complete-oral-history-w501326|title='The Weird Al Show': The Complete Oral History|last=Gaines|first=Caseen|date=September 13, 2017|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kidscreen.com/articles/magazine/19980901/22601.html|title=The CBS Kidshow|author=Virginia Robertson|date=September 1, 1998|work=KidScreen|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidscreen-cbsste"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/1998/04/01/21288-19980401/|title=STE partners with Nelvana in CBS deal|website=Kidscreen|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 2000, following the network's acquisition by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]], CBS replaced Kidshow with a [[Nickelodeon on CBS|block]] programmed by its new corporate sister [[Nickelodeon]]; the block initially focused exclusively on preschool programming from the [[Nick Jr.]] brand, but from 2002 to 2004, the block targeted a broader youth audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-news/releases/view?id=7539|title=CBS Press Express  {{!}} CBS AND NICKELODEON PRESENT|website=www.cbspressexpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/cbs-picks-nick-mix-1117782661/|title=CBS picks Nick mix|last=Schneider|first=Michael|date=June 15, 2000|work=Variety|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, after CBS and Viacom split back into separate companies, CBS partnered with [[DIC Entertainment]] to launch  [[Cookie Jar TV|KOL Secret Slumber Party]] (in conjunction with [[AOL]]'s children's vertical KOL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Synergy not kid-friendly at Eye web|url=https://variety.com/2006/digital/markets-festivals/synergy-not-kid-friendly-at-eye-web-1117936466/|author=Elizabeth Guider|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=January 19, 2006|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2006/digital/news/dic-uses-online-platform-to-dive-into-fan-base-1117951017/|title=DIC uses online platform to dive into fan base|date=October 1, 2006|work=Variety|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=May 2006 |title=DIC’s CBS block looks to reach girl viewers |url=http://kidscreen.com/content/pdf/51053.pdf |magazine=Kidscreen |page=28 |access-date=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The block was re-branded as ''KEWLopolis'' the following season as part of a new sponsorship with [[American Greetings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/cbs-blocks-out-kewlopolis/|title=CBS Blocks out KEWLopolis|date=2007-08-23|work=Animation Magazine|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cookie Jar TV in 2009 following the acquisition of DIC by [[Cookie Jar Group]].&lt;ref name="CookieJarTV"&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS Sets Lineup for Cookie Jar Block|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/articles/display/22324|work=WorldScreen|date=September 4, 2009|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zeroing In|url=http://www.kidscreen.com/articles/magazine/20090508/upfront.html?page=3|work=Kidscreen|date=May 8, 2009|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NBC]] had removed cartoons from its Saturday morning lineup in 1992 in favor of [[TNBC]], which featured live-action sitcoms aimed towards a teen audience.&lt;ref name="wp-nomore" /&gt; After declining ratings, TNBC was replaced in 2001 with [[Discovery Kids on NBC]], which was programmed by the cable channel [[Discovery Kids]] and featured [[Factual television|factual]] entertainment programming and educational cartoons (including the first animated programs aired by NBC's Saturday morning lineup since the TNBC era).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kids mixed on new skeds|url=https://variety.com/2003/tv/news/kids-mixed-on-new-skeds-1117895265/|last=Oei|first=Lily|last2=McClintock|first2=Pamela|work=Variety|accessdate=September 23, 2014|date=November 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nets face back to school blues|url=https://variety.com/2003/tv/news/nets-face-back-to-school-blues-1117891278/|last=Oei|first=Lily|work=Variety|accessdate=September 23, 2014|date=August 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC Discovery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery Gets NBC Kids' Block|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/orphan-articles/discovery-gets-nbc-kids-block/154693|last=Umstead|first=Thomas|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=September 23, 2014|date=December 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, it was replaced by [[Qubo]], a joint venture with [[Ion Media Networks]], Nelvana owner [[Corus Entertainment]], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] and [[Classic Media]] that was focused on educational programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Debuts Kids Programming Brand Qubo|url=http://adage.com/article/media/nbc-debuts-kids-programming-brand-qubo/111473/|author=Andrew Hampp|periodical=[[Advertising Age]]|date=August 24, 2006|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-qubo&gt;{{cite web|title=Qubo's Rodriguez: Offering a 'Building Block’ to Kids|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/qubo-s-rodriguez-offering-building-block-kids/367423|author=Luis Clemens|periodical=Multichannel News|date=|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Comcast]]'s purchase of NBC Universal, the network pulled out of Qubo and replaced with it with the preschool-targeted [[NBC Kids]] in 2012, which was programmed by new sister network [[Universal Kids|Sprout]].&lt;ref name="Weisman"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC to launch Saturday kids block|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118052022?refCatId=14|author=Jon Weisman|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubino"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC, With Assist From Sprout, to Launch Saturday Morning Preschool Block|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/482478-NBC_With_Assist_From_Sprout_to_Launch_Saturday_Morning_Preschool_Block.php|author=Lindsay Rubino|work=[[Multichannel News]]|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andreev"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC Launches Preschool Saturday Block Programmed By Sprout|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/03/nbc-launches-preschool-saturday-block-programmed-by-sprout|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing regulatory scrutiny, increasing competition from cable channels such as [[Cartoon Network]], Disney Channel, and Nickelodeon (which benefited from [[corporate synergy|synergy]] and [[cross-promotion]] with ABC, CBS, and [[The WB]]'s children's blocks),&lt;ref name="variety-kidscheds"/&gt; as well as [[video on-demand]] services, made non-educational Saturday morning programming less viable for networks. In June 2014, [[The CW]], whose [[Vortexx]] block (programmed by [[Saban Brands]]) made it the last major U.S. network to still program non-educational programming on weekend mornings, announced that it would replace it with an E/I-centric block for the next television season.&lt;ref name="wp-nomore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline-ctaads" /&gt;

=== Notable fines ===
In 2007, [[Univision]] agreed to a record $24 million fine for violations of the educational programming regulations across 24 of its stations, after falsely asserting that several youth-targeted [[telenovela]]s (such as ''[[Cómplices Al Rescate]]'') were educational in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/25/business/fi-univision25|title=FCC to fine Univision $24 million|last=Puzzanghera|first=Jim|date=February 25, 2007|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 15, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airings of the [[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime]] on [[Kids' WB]] induced notable violations of the program-length commercial restrictions, due to the airing of commercials for products such as [[Eggo]] waffles, [[Fruit by the Foot]], and the [[Nintendo e-Reader]] accessory for the [[Game Boy Advance]], that contained ''[[Pokémon]]''-related tie-ins. The FCC fined individual [[network affiliate|affiliate]]s of [[The WB]] and upheld the fines on appeal (despite [[WCIU-TV]] trying to defend itself by arguing that the references were "fleeting"), even though it was the network which transmitted the content.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080330-fcc-fends-off-fleeting-pokemon-attack.html|title=FCC fends off 'fleeting Pokemon' waffle attack|last=Lasar|first=Matthew|date=March 30, 2008|work=[[Ars Technica]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three More Stations Face FCC Fines|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/three-more-stations-face-fcc-fines/32431|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=May 27, 2008|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Strikes Again|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/advertising-and-marketing/pokemon-strikes-again/50950|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=October 14, 2008|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Fines KHCW For Pokemon Ad|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fcc-fines-khcw-pokemon-ad/83603|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=August 31, 2007|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Ad Bites WPIX|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/pokemon-ad-bites-wpix/83263|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=July 13, 2007|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[KSKN]] in Spokane, Washington was similarly fined $70,000 for having, on multiple occasions, aired an advertisement for a local collectibles shop during ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' that contained references to its [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|trading card game]] as being among products sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tvnewscheck.com/article/42644/fcc-fines-7-for-kids-tv-ad-violations/|title=FCC Fines 7 For Kid's TV Ad Violations|date=June 1, 2010|work=TVNewsCheck|access-date=July 15, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Disney and Viacom were respectively issued $1 million and $500,000 fines for violating the limits on advertising during children's programming on [[ABC Family]] and [[Nickelodeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/19692/fcc-fines-disney-viacom-15-million-in-children.html|title=FCC Fines Disney, Viacom: $1.5 Million In Children's TV Violations|work=MediaPost Publications|language=en|access-date=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shift in demographics and content ===
In the early 2010's, broadcasters began to change the manner in which they addressed their E/I obligations, shifting to blocks of [[factual television|factual]], documentary- and [[reality television|reality]]-style series aimed at a teen (13-16 years old) audience, in lieu of conventional children's programs (such as cartoons).&lt;ref name="deadline-ctaads" /&gt; Throughout the decade, ABC ([[Litton's Weekend Adventure]]),&lt;ref name=TVNewsCheck&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC Orders Saturday Kids Block From Litton |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/05/24/51447/abc-orders-saturday-kids-block-from-litton |accessdate=May 24, 2011 |newspaper=TVNewsCheck |date=May 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204120253/http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/51447/abc-orders-saturday-kids-block-from-litton |archivedate=December 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Broadcasting&amp;Cable&gt;{{cite news|last=Albiniak|first=Paige|title=ABC to Premiere ABC Weekend Adventure on Sept. 3|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/468736-ABC_to_Premiere_ABC_Weekend_Adventure_on_Sept_3.php|accessdate=May 24, 2011|newspaper=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS ([[CBS Dream Team]]), [[The CW]] ([[One Magnificent Morning]]),&lt;ref name="OMM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/06/the-cw-saturday-morning-block-litton-entertainment/|title=The CW Sets 5-Hour Saturday Morning Block|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=June 6, 2014|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wp-nomore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/30/saturday-morning-cartoons-are-no-more/|title=Saturday morning cartoons are no more|last=Sullivan|first=Gail|work=The Washington Post|date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NBC ([[The More You Know (block)|The More You Know]]) all leased their weekend morning blocks to Litton Entertainment to air such programming. After dropping [[4Kids TV]] in 2008 (which by then, had only scheduled a single half-hour of E/I programming within) in favor of programming a [[Weekend Marketplace|national block]] of [[infomercials]] under the internal title "[[Weekend Marketplace]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/longform-ads-replace-kid-fare-on-fox-1117996360/|title=Longform ads replace kid fare on Fox|last=Schneider|first=Michael|date=2008-11-24|work=Variety|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] entered into a similar arrangement with [[Steve Rotfeld Productions]] to produce the [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]-based block [[Xploration Station]], which premiered in September 2014.&lt;ref name="deadline-ctaads" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wp-nomore" /&gt; 

As they are only applied to programs targeting viewers 12 and younger, these programs are not subject to the advertising restrictions prescribed by the Children's Television Act. Litton faced criticism from Peggy Charren's daughter Claudia Moquin, for including [[product placement]] from "[[Underwriting spot|underwriter]]s" in some of its programs (such as [[Electronic Arts]], [[Norwegian Cruise Line]], and [[SeaWorld]]), which, when combined with the lack of restrictions on commercial time, were described as a contravention of the spirit of the CTA. Litton defended its practices, stating that its programming was designed to meet "child psychologist-developed standards that did not exist prior to 1990", and considered them to be a preferential alternative to airing ads for junk food and toys instead.&lt;ref name="deadline-ctaads"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preteen Saturday Morning Kids Shows Abandoned By Broadcast Networks|url=http://deadline.com/2016/06/kids-tv-shows-saturday-mornings-fcc-loophole-advertising-1201774658/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/09/theres-more-to-know-about-the-more-you-know/380242/|title='The More You Know': There's More to Know|last=Garber|first=Megan|work=The Atlantic|date=September 16, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PBS]] member stations have been an exception to this trend, as they continue to air conventional, educational children's programming under the blanket branding [[PBS Kids]]. Member stations may also offer a full-time PBS Kids channel as a digital subchannel service.&lt;ref name="rbr-kidvid" /&gt;

==Background==
Remind101 was founded in 2011 by brothers Brett and David Kopf to help bridge the communication gap in primary education.&lt;ref name=tc&gt;{{cite web|last=Empson|first=Rip|title=Now At 30K Schools And Growing Fast, Remind101 Is On A Mission To Modernize Classroom Communication|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/18/now-in-30k-schools-Remind101-lands-3-5m-from-socialcapital-yuri-milner-more-to-bring-texting-to-teachers/|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pando&gt;{{cite web|last=MOTT|first=NATHANIEL|title=Remind101 helps teachers communicate with students without fear|url=http://pando.com/2013/10/28/Remind101-helps-teachers-communicate-with-students-without-fear/|publisher=Pando Daily|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613095254/http://pando.com/2013/10/28/remind101-helps-teachers-communicate-with-students-without-fear/|archivedate=2014-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, they added former [[Bleacher Report]] CEO Brian Grey to the team as CEO.&lt;ref name=forbes2&gt;{{cite web|last=Konrad|first=Alex|title=Parent-Teacher App Remind Passes 20 Million Users, Taps Former Bleacher Report Boss As New CEO|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/09/14/remind-passes-20-million-users-appoints-former-bleacher-report-boss-as-ceo/#7180d03d1947|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brett Kopf was diagnosed with [[attention deficit disorder]] and dyslexia while he was still in school. His brother David set up a system whereby school faculty could remind him of an upcoming test. Brett credits this system with playing a part in his success in school.&lt;ref name=EdSurge/&gt;&lt;ref name=pando/&gt; The two decided to make the system into a company and became part of the first class at the Imagine K12 incubator in [[Palo Alto, CA]], where all startups must focus on improving education.&lt;ref name=tc1&gt;{{cite web|last=Tsotsis|first=Alexia|title=Remind101 Is A Private Twitter For Teachers|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/14/Remind101-is-a-private-twitter-for-teachers/|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2014, Kopf announced that Remind101 would be changing its name simply to Remind.&lt;ref name=remindblog&gt;{{cite web|title=Remind: New Name, Same Mission|url=https://blog.remind.com/new-name-same-mission/|website=Remind Blog|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Educational impact===
The platform is designed to increase parental engagement which has been linked to increased student performance.&lt;ref name=harvard&gt;{{cite web|last=Kraft|first=Matthew|title=The Effect of Teacher-Family Communication on Student Engagement: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/mkraft/publications/effect-teacher-family-communication-student-engagement-evidence-randomized-field|publisher=Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed teacher to family communication increased homework turn in by 42%, kept students more focused and increased participation.&lt;ref name=harvard/&gt;

==Funding==
In September 2013, Remind closed a $3.5 million round of series A financing, led by [[The Social+Capital Partnership]], with participation from [[Yuri Milner]], Maneesh Arora and other angel investors.&lt;ref name=tc/&gt; As part of the round, [[Chamath Palihapitiya]] joined Remind's board of directors.&lt;ref name=tc/&gt;

In February 2014, Remind raised $15 million in Series B funding led by [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] with additional participation from its previous investors, including Social + Capital and First Round Capital.&lt;ref name=techcrunch/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; In coordination with the round, the company added [[John Doerr]], a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins, to its board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Startup Remind101 Nabs Kleiner-Led $15 Million|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-04/education-startup-Remind101-nabs-kleiner-led-15-million.html|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silvio Antoniani''' (31 December 1540, [[Rome]] - 16 August 1603, [[Rome]]) was a musician, canon lawyer, writer on education, [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] and [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who spent most of his career in the [[Roman Curia]].

==Life==
The son of a poor wool merchant, his talent with the [[lyre]] at a young age drew the attention of many patrons and led indirectly to his career in the Church.

Cardinal [[Otto Truchsess von Waldburg]] funded his education at a young age. [[Pope Julius III]] provided Antoniani with room and board at the [[Apostolic Palace]]. He met [[Ercole II d'Este]], [[Duke of Ferrara]], who sponsored his studies at the [[University of Ferrara]], where Antoniani earned a [[doctor of civil and canon law|doctorate in civil and canon law]] in 1556, and was professor of [[classical literature]].

After the death of the Duke of Ferrara, he returned to Rome. In 1563 Pope [[Pius IV]] appointed him to the chair of belles-lettres in [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza University]], a position in which he worked with St [[Charles Borromeo]], who made him his personal secretary. In 1566 he resigned the chair, and took up the study of theology under the direction of St [[Philip Neri]] and was ordained [[priest]] on 12 June 1568.

[[Pope Pius V]] named him Secretary of the [[College of Cardinals]], a position he held for twenty-four years. [[Pope Sixtus V]] named him secretary of the [[Congregation of Bishops and Regulars]]. [[Clement VIII]] appointed him [[Secretariate of Briefs to Princes and of Latin Letters|Secretary of Papal Briefs]] in 1593. Antoniano was also [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household|Master of the Papal Chamber]] and a [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of the [[Basilica of Saint Peter]].

Pope Clement created him [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal Priest]] of ''[[San Salvatore in Lauro]]'' on 3 March 1599. He was present at the acceptance of the [[Union of Brest]], and two of his writings are inscribed on the north and south faces of the pedestal supporting the [[Vatican Obelisk]] in [[Saint Peter's Square]]. He died in Rome in 1603, and is interred in [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]].

==Works==
With the advent of [[Renaissance humanism|Italian humanism]] in the late sixteenth century, Antoniano devoted himself to the study of educational problems and at the instance of St [[Charles Borromeo]], wrote his principal work on the Christian education of children, (''Tre libri dell' educazione cristiana de' figliuoli'', Verona, 1584.) His work passed through several editions in Italian and was translated into French by Guignard (Troyes, 1856; Paris, 1873), and into German by Kunz (Freiburg, 1888). The other writings of Antoniano, many of which have not been published, deal with literary, historical, and liturgical subjects.

He was one of the compilers of the [[Roman Catechism]] and a member of the commission charged by Clement VIII with the revision of the [[Breviary]].

The '''Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge''' ('''SDUK'''), was founded in 1826, mainly at the instigation of [[Henry Peter Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]],&lt;ref&gt;B. Hilton, ''A Mad, Bad, &amp; Dangerous People?'' (Oxford 2008) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; with the object of publishing information to people who were unable to obtain formal teaching, or who preferred [[autodidactism|self-education]].  A [[British Whig Party|Whiggish]] London organisation that published inexpensive texts intended to adapt scientific and similarly high-minded material for the rapidly expanding reading public, it was wound up in 1848.

An American group of the same name was founded as part of the [[Lyceum movement]] in the United States around the same period. Its [[Boston Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|Boston branch]] sponsored lectures by such speakers as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and was active from 1829 to 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Calendar of Lectures Presented by the Boston Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1829–1847) |authors=Helen R. Deese and Guy R. Woodall |journal=Studies in the American Renaissance |year=1986 |pages=17–67 |jstor=30227545}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]] cites the Society in his essay "Walking," in which he jestingly proposes a Society for the Diffusion of Useful Ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoreau.eserver.org/walking3.html#3 Thoreau's Walking – 3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704002031/http://thoreau.eserver.org/walking3.html |date=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
SDUK publications were intended for the working class and the middle class, as an antidote to the more radical output of the pauper presses. The society set out to achieve this by acting as an intermediary between authors and publishers by launching several series of publications. It was run by a committee of eminent persons, and had a close association with the newly formed [[University College London]], as well as the numerous provincial [[Mechanics' Institutes]]. Its printers included Baldwin &amp; Cradock, later succeeded by [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]]. The Society commissioned work and dealt with the printers, and finally distributed the publications; profits were used to continue the Society's work.

==Development==
While conceived with high ideals the project gradually failed, as subscribers fell away and sale of publications declined. Charles Knight was largely responsible for what success SDUK publications did have; he engaged in extensive promotional campaigns, and worked to improve the readability of the sometimes abstruse material.&lt;ref name="Secord, pp 48-50"&gt;Secord, ''Victorian Sensation'', pp 48–50&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless many of the titles had little interest to readers, though the ''[[Penny Magazine]]'' at its peak had a circulation of around 200,000 copies a week. The Society eventually wound up in 1848, though some of its works apparently continued to be published. The archives of the Society are in the possession of the University College London.

The Society was not without opposition, and the ''[[Literary Gazette]]'' mounted a campaign on behalf of the book trade, supported by publications such as the ''Royal Lady's Magazine'', who complained in the early 1830s that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Few persons are aware that the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge have done, and are still doing, more to ruin the Book trade than all the change of times, the want of money, the weight of taxes, and even the law of Libel have accomplished; yet they – a committee of Noblemen and pretended Patriots – are permitted to go on in their unfeeling, nay, considering the hundreds of thousands engaged in the Book trade, we may add brutal, career, without interruption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wm8EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Society+for+the+Diffusion+of+Useful+Knowledge++charity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VGQnTraqPMyr8AOL8LnsCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Society%20for%20the%20Diffusion%20of%20Useful%20Knowledge%20%20charity&amp;f=false The ''Royal Lady's Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Publications==

===Library of Useful Knowledge===
One significant set of publications by the SDUK was the Library of Useful Knowledge;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishinghistory.com/library-of-useful-knowledge.html Library of Useful Knowledge (Baldwin &amp; Craddock; then Charles Knight) - Book Series List], publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 14 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; sold for a [[British sixpence coin|sixpence]] and published biweekly, its books focused on scientific topics.  The first volume, an introduction to the series by Brougham, sold over 33,000 copies.  However, attempts to reach the working class market were largely unsuccessful; only among the middle class was there sustained interest in popular science texts.&lt;ref name="Secord, pp 48-50"/&gt;

Like many other works in the new genre of popular scientific narratives—such as the ''[[Bridgewater Treatises]]'' and [[Humphry Davy]]'s ''Consolations in Travel''—the books of the Library of Useful Knowledge focused on [[natural theology]] and imbued scientific fields with concepts of progress: [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] in geology, the [[nebular hypothesis]] in astronomy, and the [[scala naturae]] in the life sciences.  According to historian James Secord, such works met a demand for "general concepts and simple laws", and in the process helped establish the authority of professional science and specialised scientific disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Secord, ''Victorian Sensation'', pp 55–62; quotation from p 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other SDUK publications===

==In popular culture==
*[[Thomas Love Peacock]] satirised the SPUK in 1831 in ''Crotchet Castle'' as the 'Steam Intellect Society':&lt;ref&gt;B. Wilson, ''Decency and Disorder'' (London 2007) p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; a vicarage is almost set on fire by a "cook taking it into her head to study hydrostatics, in a sixpenny tract, published by the Steam Intellect Society".&lt;ref&gt;T S Peacock, ''Nightmare Abbey and Crotchet Castle'' (London 1947) P. 106&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the Notes to Anthony Trollope's book, Framley Parsonage, published by Oxford University Press as a World's Classic in 1980, P. D. Edwards writes that Trollope's character, Lord Boanerges, "may have been modelled in some respects on Lord Brougham.... founder of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge".
*References to the Society are rare in the modern era, but within [[Steampunk]] culture, it is not entirely uncommon to refer to the Society itself and/or its better-known publications in an attempt to lend Victorian verisimilitude. The in-house publishing organ of the [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] in Los Angeles is called the Society for the Diffusion of Useful ''Information''; while many communities in North America have established Societies for Learning in Retirement which are partially modelled along the same lines with the goal of disseminating knowledge amongst people who, although retired, are still interested in continuing to learn.

'''Space Bucks''' was a space trading simulation developed by [[Impressions Games]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line]]. The game focuses on the creation of a trade empire against several computer controlled opponents. Victory is achieved through a combination of infrastructure investments, the stock market, piracy, sabotage, and of course trade goods.

==Plot==
In the year 2375, Humans share the galaxy with four other races, the Colikars, Tesarians, Secanii, and the Krec N'had. Your fledgling trading company, consisting of a single port and a single ship, must, by the year 2500, expand by any means necessary to become the dominant trade empire in the galaxy. Three computer opponents will be pursuing the same goal.

==Gameplay==
There are numerous mechanics for the player to utilize in order to achieve victory.

===Ships===
Ships do the heavy lifting in the game. Without ships, the goods produced at planets can't be transported and the highest level goods can't be manufactured due to a lack of the appropriate resources. At the start of the game only a few ship types are available. As the game progresses new, more advanced ship types become available.

Ships have several stats which determine its suitability for use. Range, Speed, Capacity, Efficiency, Drive, and Maintenance cost.

===Planets===
Planets generate all of the trade goods in the galaxy. These goods range from food, to passengers, to luxury goods. The higher in development a planet is, the more and the greater the variety of goods that are produced. Once the highest levels of development can be reached the most expensive, and thus profitable, goods can be manufactured.

To gain access to a planet, a bid must be made on a planet which does not already have a deal with another trade company. The player must open negotiations with such a planet and if their demands are agreed to, they will ally themselves with the players trade company. The demands include a monthly rent paid by the player, the delivery of a specified good at regular intervals, and an agreement to build a specified piece of infrastructure on the planet within a certain timeframe. The demand for monthly rent is made for every planet, with the other two demands being optional and dependent on the developmental level of the planet.

Planets have morale which can be modified by in-game factors. Investing in planetary infrastructure can often help improve the morale of a planet and ensure docking rights are not lost. Should a planet be lost to an unhappy local populace, the player must begin negotiations for docking rights again. The higher the developmental level of the planet, the more infrastructure will be needed to keep the planet happy.

===Trade Goods===
Trade goods include fuel, food, passengers, and exotic goods such as wine and weapons. Each race produces different high-end goods than it consumes.

===Stock Market===
Each trading company has stock which can be sold on the market for an infusion of cash. Buying out the competition, by accumulating a majority of their stock, is possible. Stock can be bought and sold throughout the game, making it possible to sell lots of stock early for an early boost and then buy it back when the other companies sell off the shares they own.

===Piracy===
Pirates can be hired to harass the competition. They can be paid to harass the player as well. When a pirate attacks there are only a couple of options, pay them off, try to run, or fight back. The correct action to take will depend heavily on the specific ship being threatened and the upgrades that it has been outfitted with.

===Sabotage===
Sabotage missions can be undertaken to hurt the competitions bottom line. Of course the competition can do the same to the player.

===News Events===
A very basic mechanic, News Events inform the player of all the important events such as new ships, engines, or weapon systems which have become available. Sudden changes in the markets may also be announced throughout the game, giving the player the chance to make a quick profit.

==Critical reception==
A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' focused on the lack of anything to do in the game besides bid for landing rights and choose cargo: "No cut-throat strategy for undermining the competition's prices, no sabotage of trading routes, no space battles - not even the occasional price war." He recommended that players get "much better" business sims such as ''[[Transport Tycoon]]'' or ''[[Capitalism (video game)|Capitalism]]'' instead, and gave it 1 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name="NGen18"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Space Bucks |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=18|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1996|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Village (Gamer's Zone) wrote "The plot was a little thin for my taste, but if reading the business section of the paper excites you, then this game would be a must for you. The main weakness that I see in this program is lack of originality. I see parts of Railroad Tycoon, Civilization, Sim City among others, as well as the obvious connection to Air bucks v1.2. Nothing wrong with recycling older programs, especially as hardware improvements allow the newer versions to make improvements on game performance. That is what happened with this game. Unfortunately, it has a rushed feeling and fails to capitalize on the improvements there were put in the game."&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/spacebuk.htm&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' said "If you love to create ornate moving sculptures that generate endless money but do very little else interesting, then SPACE BUCKS will have some appeal for you. Set at its hardest level, the game offers two or three hours of challenge before your empire grows to the point that nothing can really harm it and you simply sit around absorbing planets from your competitors and doing more and more unwieldy upgrades to your entire fleet. Other than that, it is pretty to look at, but definitely no AIR BUCKS in Space."{{cn|date=April 2017}} ''[[Computer Games Magazine]]'' wrote "Dealing with manufacturing, the bank and stock market, and random events do add a few things (bowling pins and knives?), but there still aren't a lot of different things to do (as in, say, Sim City or Capitalism). Despite this, you have to watch these things very closely, and it is easy for things to go critical very quickly. At the beginner level I played (and quickly lost) four games before I'd gotten a business that was even barely stable (and I was at the bottom of the pack). Maybe I just don't have a nose for business, but my attention wasn't strongly held. Beginning business sim fans might get more out of Space Bucks than I did, but I suspect advanced gamers will want to stick with a more detailed game like Capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20031103233809/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/005/087/space_bucks_review.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Subtitles''' are [[Writing|text]] derived from either a transcript or [[screenplay]] of the dialog or commentary in films, television programs, video games, and the like, usually displayed at the bottom of the screen, but can also be at the top of the screen if there is already text at the bottom of the screen. They can either be a form of written [[translation]] of a dialog in a foreign language, or a written rendering of the dialog in the same language, with or without added information to help viewers who are [[deaf]] or [[hard of hearing]] to follow the dialog, or people who cannot understand the spoken dialogue or who have accent recognition problems.

The encoded method can either be pre-rendered with the video or separate as either a graphic or text to be rendered and overlaid by the receiver.  The separate subtitles are used for [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] and television [[teletext]]/[[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) subtitling or [[EIA-608]] captioning, which are hidden unless requested by the viewer from a menu or remote controller key or by selecting the relevant page or service (e.g., p.&amp;nbsp;888 or CC1), always carry additional sound representations for deaf and hard of hearing viewers. Teletext subtitle language follows the original audio, except in multi-lingual countries where the broadcaster may provide subtitles in additional languages on other teletext pages.  EIA-608 captions are similar, except that North American Spanish stations may provide captioning in Spanish on CC3. DVD and Blu-ray only differ in using [[run-length]] encoded graphics instead of text, as well as some HD DVB broadcasts.

Sometimes, mainly at [[film festival]]s, subtitles may be shown on a separate display below the screen, thus saving the film-maker from creating a subtitled copy for perhaps just one showing. Television subtitling for the deaf and hard of hearing is also referred to as [[closed captioning]] in some countries.

More exceptional uses also include operas, such as Verdi's Aida, where sung lyrics in Italian are subtitled in English or in another local language outside the stage area on luminous screens for the audience to follow the storyline, or on a screen attached to the back of the chairs in front of the audience.

The word ''subtitle'' is the prefix ''sub-'' ("below") followed by ''title''. In some cases, such as live [[opera]], the dialog is displayed above the stage in what are referred to as ''[[surtitles]]'' (''sur-'' meaning "above").

== Creation, delivery and display of subtitles ==

Today, professional subtitlers usually work with specialized computer software and hardware where the video is digitally stored on a hard disk, making each individual frame instantly accessible. Besides creating the subtitles, the subtitler usually also tells the computer software the exact positions where each subtitle should appear and disappear. For cinema film, this task is traditionally done by separate technicians. The end result is a subtitle file containing the actual subtitles as well as position markers indicating where each subtitle should appear and disappear. These markers are usually based on [[SMPTE time code|timecode]] if it is a work for electronic media (e.g., TV, video, DVD), or on film length (measured in feet and frames) if the subtitles are to be used for traditional cinema film.

The finished subtitle file is used to add the subtitles to the picture, either:
* directly into the picture (open subtitles);
* embedded in the [[vertical interval]] and later superimposed on the picture by the end user with the help of an external decoder or a decoder built into the TV (closed subtitles on TV or video);
* or converted (rendered) to [[Tagged Image File Format|tiff]] or [[BMP file format|bmp]] graphics that are later superimposed on the picture by the end user's equipment (closed subtitles on DVD or as part of a DVB broadcast).

Subtitles can also be created by individuals using freely available subtitle-creation software like [[Subtitle Workshop]] for Windows, [[MovieCaptioner]] for Mac/Windows, and [[Subtitle Composer]] for Linux, and then hardcode them onto a video file with programs such as [[VirtualDub]] in combination with [[VSFilter]] which could also be used to show subtitles as softsubs in many [[Video player (software)|software video players]].

== Same-language captions ==
Same-language captions, i.e., without translation, were primarily intended as an aid for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Internationally, there are several major studies which demonstrate that same-language captioning can have a major impact on literacy and reading growth across a broad range of reading abilities.&lt;ref name=AshokaBrij&gt;''[http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/3557 Brij Kothari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828182628/http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/3557 |date=2008-08-28 }}'' from  [http://www.ashoka.org/ Ashoka.org]. Accessed on February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFF1&gt;Biswas, Ranjita (2005). ''[http://www.asianfilm.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=98 Hindi film songs can boost literacy rates in India] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820005707/http://www.asianfilm.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=98 |date=2009-08-20 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; This method of subtitling is used by national television broadcasters in [[China]] and in  [[India]] such as [[Doordarshan]]. This idea was struck upon by [[Brij Kothari]], who believed that SLS makes reading practice an incidental, automatic, and subconscious part of popular TV entertainment, at a low per-person cost to shore up [[Literacy in India|literacy rates in India]].

=== Same-language subtitling ===
[[Same language subtitling]] (SLS) is the use of synchronized captioning of musical lyrics (or any text with an audio/video source) as a repeated reading activity. The basic reading activity involves students viewing a short subtitled presentation projected onscreen, while completing a response worksheet. To be really effective, the subtitling should have high quality synchronization of audio and text, and better yet, subtitling should change color in syllabic synchronization to audio model, and the text should be at a level to challenge students' language abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.editlib.org/p/27350|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709105516/http://go.editlib.org/p/27350|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-09|title=McCall, W.

=== Closed captions ===
{{Main|Closed captioning}}
[[File:Closed captioning symbol.svg|right|thumb|The "CC in a TV" symbol [[Jack Foley (sound effects)|Jack Foley]] created, while senior graphic designer at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] [[Public broadcasting|public broadcaster]] [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] that invented captioning for television, is [[public domain]] so that anyone who captions TV programs can use it.]]

Closed captioning is the American term for closed subtitles specifically intended for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. These are a transcription rather than a translation, and usually contain descriptions of important non-dialog audio as well such as "(sighs)", "(wind blowing)", "("SONG TITLE" playing)", "(kisses)" or "(door creaks)" and lyrics. From the expression "closed captions" the word "caption" has in recent years come to mean a subtitle intended for the deaf or hard of hearing, be it "open" or "closed". In British English "subtitles" usually refers to subtitles for the  deaf or hard of hearing (SDH); however, the term "SDH" is sometimes used when there is a need to make a distinction between the two.

==== Real time ====
Programs such as news bulletins, current affairs programs, sport, some talk shows and political and special events utilize real time or online captioning.&lt;ref name="dcita"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live captioning is increasingly common, especially in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], as a result of regulations that stipulate that virtually all TV eventually must be accessible for people who are deaf and hard–of–hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncicap.org/caphist.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719060406/http://www.ncicap.org/caphist.asp |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, these "real time" subtitles will typically lag the audio by several seconds due to the inherent delay in transcribing, encoding, and transmitting the subtitles. Real time subtitles are also challenged by typographic errors or mis-hearing of the spoken words, with no time available to correct before transmission.

===== Pre-prepared =====
Some programs may be prepared in their entirety several hours before broadcast, but with insufficient time to prepare a timecoded caption file for automatic play-out. Pre-prepared captions look similar to offline captions, although the accuracy of cueing may be compromised slightly as the captions are not locked to program timecode.&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt;

Newsroom captioning involves the automatic transfer of text from the newsroom computer system to a device which outputs it as captions. It does work, but its suitability as an exclusive system would only apply to programs which had been scripted in their entirety on the newsroom computer system, such as short interstitial updates.&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt;

In the United States and Canada, some broadcasters have used it exclusively and simply left uncaptioned sections of the bulletin for which a script was unavailable.&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt; Newsroom captioning limits captions to pre-scripted materials and, therefore, does not cover 100% of the news, weather and sports segments of a typical local news broadcast which are typically not pre-scripted, last-second breaking news or changes to the scripts, ad lib conversations of the broadcasters, emergency or other live remote broadcasts by reporters in-the-field. By failing to cover items such as these, newsroom style captioning (or use of the [[Teleprompter]] for captioning) typically results in coverage of less than 30% of a local news broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===== Live =====
Communication Access Real-Time Translation (CART) [[stenographer]]s, who use a computer with using either [[stenotype]] or [[Velotype]] keyboards to transcribe stenographic input for presentation as captions within 2–3 seconds of the representing audio, must caption anything which is purely live and unscripted{{where|date=December 2014}};&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt; however, the most recent developments include operators using [[speech recognition]] software and revoicing the dialog. Speech recognition technology has advanced so quickly in the United States that about 50% of all live captioning is through speech recognition as of 2005.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Real-time captions look different from offline captions, as they are presented as a continuous flow of text as people speak.&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2011}}

Real-time stenographers are the most highly skilled in their profession. Stenography is a system of rendering words phonetically, and English, with its multitude of homophones (e.g., there, their, they’re), is particularly unsuited to easy transcriptions. Stenographers working in courts and inquiries usually have 24 hours in which to deliver their transcripts. Consequently, they may enter the same phonetic stenographic codes for a variety of homophones, and fix up the spelling later. Real-time stenographers must deliver their transcriptions accurately and immediately. They must therefore develop techniques for keying homophones differently, and be unswayed by the pressures of delivering accurate product on immediate demand.&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt;

Submissions to recent captioning-related inquiries have revealed concerns from broadcasters about captioning sports. Captioning sports may also affect many different people because of the weather outside of it. In much sport captioning's absence, the Australian Caption Centre submitted to the National Working Party on Captioning (NWPC), in November 1998, three examples of sport captioning, each performed on tennis, rugby league and swimming programs:
#Heavily reduced: Captioners ignore commentary and provide only scores and essential information such as “try” or “out”.
#Significantly reduced: Captioners use [[QWERTY]] input to type summary captions yielding the essence of what the commentators are saying, delayed due to the limitations of QWERTY input.
#Comprehensive realtime: Captioners use stenography to caption the commentary in its entirety.&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt;

The NWPC concluded that the standard they accept is the comprehensive real-time method, which gives them access to the commentary in its entirety. Also, not all sports are live.  Many events are pre-recorded hours before they are broadcast, allowing a captioner to caption them using offline methods.&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt;

===== Hybrid =====
Because different programs are produced under different conditions, a case-by-case basis must consequently determine captioning methodology. Some bulletins may have a high incidence of truly live material, or insufficient access to video feeds and scripts may be provided to the captioning facility, making stenography unavoidable. Other bulletins may be pre-recorded just before going to air, making pre-prepared text preferable.&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt;

In Australia and the United Kingdom, hybrid methodologies have proven to be the best way to provide comprehensive, accurate and cost-effective captions on news and current affairs programs. News captioning applications currently available are designed to accept text from a variety of inputs: stenography, Velotype, [[QWERTY]], [[ASCII]] import, and the newsroom computer. This allows one facility to handle a variety of online captioning requirements and to ensure that captioners properly caption all programs.&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt;

Current affairs programs usually require stenographic assistance. Even though the segments which comprise a current affairs program may be produced in advance, they are usually done so just before on-air time and their duration makes QWERTY input of text unfeasible.&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt;

News bulletins, on the other hand, can often be captioned without stenographic input (unless there are live crosses or ad-libbing by the presenters).  This is because:
#Most items are scripted on the newsroom computer system and this text can be electronically imported into the captioning system.
#Individual news stories are of short duration, so even if they are made available only just prior to broadcast, there is still time to QWERTY in text.&lt;ref name="dcita" /&gt;

==== Offline ====
For non-live, or pre-recorded programs, television program providers can choose offline captioning. Captioners gear offline captioning toward the high-end television industry, providing highly customized captioning features, such as pop-on style captions, specialized screen placement, speaker identifications, italics, special characters, and sound effects.&lt;ref name="Offline"&gt;{{cite web

=== Subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing (SDH) ===
Subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing (SDH) is an American term introduced by the DVD industry. It refers to regular subtitles in the original language where important non-dialog information has been added, as well as speaker identification, which may be useful when the viewer cannot otherwise visually tell who is saying what.

The only significant difference for the user between SDH subtitles and closed captions is their appearance: SDH subtitles usually are displayed with the same proportional font used for the translation subtitles on the DVD; however, closed captions are displayed as white text on a black band, which blocks a large portion of the view. Closed captioning is falling out of favor as many users have no difficulty reading SDH subtitles, which are text with contrast outline. In addition, DVD subtitles can specify many colors, on the same character: primary, outline, shadow, and background. This allows subtitlers to display subtitles on a usually translucent band for easier reading; however, this is rare, since most subtitles use an outline and shadow instead, in order to block a smaller portion of the picture. Closed captions may still supersede DVD subtitles, since many SDH subtitles present all of the text centered, while closed captions usually specify position on the screen: centered, left align, right align, top, etc. This is helpful for speaker identification and overlapping conversation. Some SDH  subtitles (such as the subtitles of newer [[Universal Studios]] DVDs/Blu-ray Discs) do have positioning, but it is not as common.

DVDs for the U.S. market now sometimes have three forms of English subtitles: SDH subtitles; English subtitles, helpful for viewers who may not be hearing impaired but whose first language may not be English (although they are usually an exact transcript and not simplified); and closed caption data that is decoded by the end-user's closed caption decoder. Most anime releases in the U.S. only include as subtitles translations of the original material; therefore, SDH subtitles of English dubs ("dubtitles") are uncommon.

High-definition disc media ([[HD DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc]]) uses SDH subtitles as the sole method because technical specifications do not require HD to support line 21 closed captions. Some Blu-ray Discs, however, are said to carry a closed caption stream that only displays through standard-definition connections. Many [[High-definition television|HDTVs]] allow the end–user to customize the captions, including the ability to remove the black band.

=== Use by those not deaf or hard of hearing ===
Although same-language subtitles and captions are produced primarily with the deaf and hard of hearing in mind, many hearing film and television viewers choose to use them. This is often done because the presence of closed captioning and subtitles ensures that not one word of dialogue will be missed. Bars and other noisy public places, where film dialogue would otherwise be drowned out, often make closed captions visible for patrons. Viewers may also find thick regional accents from other same-language countries hard to understand without subtitles. Films and television shows often have subtitles displayed in the same language if the speaker has a speech impairment. In addition, captions may reveal information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain from hearing. Some examples would be song lyrics, dialog spoken quietly or by those with accents unfamiliar to the intended audience, or supportive, minor dialog from background characters. It is argued{{Weasel inline|date=February 2014}} that such additional information and detail enhances the overall experience and allows the viewer a better grasp of the material. Furthermore, people learning a foreign language may sometimes use same-language subtitles to better understand the dialog without having to resort to a translation.

==== Asia ====
In some Asian television programming, captioning is considered a part of the genre, and has evolved beyond simply capturing what is being said. The captions are used artistically; it is common to see the words appear one by one as they are spoken, in a multitude of fonts, colors, and sizes that capture the spirit of what is being said. Languages like Japanese also have a rich vocabulary of [[Japanese sound symbolism|onomatopoeia]] which is used in captioning.

===== East Asia =====
In some East Asian countries, especially Chinese-speaking ones, subtitling is common in all taped television programs. In these countries, written text remains mostly uniform while regional dialects in the spoken form can be mutually unintelligible. Therefore, subtitling offers a distinct advantage to aid comprehension. With subtitles, programs in [[Putonghua]], the standard Mandarin, or any dialect can be understood by viewers unfamiliar with it.

On-screen subtitles as seen in Japanese variety television shows are more for decorative purpose, something that is not seen in television in Europe and the Americas. Some shows even place [[sound effect]]s over those subtitles. This practice of subtitling has been spread to neighbouring countries including South Korea and Taiwan. [[Asia Television|ATV]] in Hong Kong once practiced this style of decorative subtitles on its variety shows when it was owned by [[Want Want]] Holdings in Taiwan (which also owns [[China Television|CTV]] and [[Chung T'ien Television|CTI]]).

===== South Asia =====
In [[India]], [[Same Language Subtitling]] (SLS) are common for films and music videos. SLS refers to the idea of subtitling in the same language as the audio. SLS is highlighted [[karaoke]] style, that is, to speech. The idea of SLS was initiated to shore up literacy rates as SLS makes reading practice an incidental, automatic, and subconscious part of popular TV entertainment. This idea was well received by the [[Government of India]] which now uses SLS on several national channels, including [[Doordarshan]].&lt;ref name="AshokaBrij" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Biswas, Ranjita (2005).

== Translation ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
Translation basically means conversion of one language into another language in wrtten or spoken form. The process of translation requires a translator e.g. Google Translate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google translate |url=https://translate.google.co.in/}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Microsoft Translator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft translator |url=https://translator.microsoft.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Subtitles can be used to translate dialog from a foreign language into the native language of the audience. It is not only the quickest and cheapest method of translating content, but is also usually preferred as it is possible for the audience to hear the original dialog and voices of the actors.

Subtitle translation can be different from the [[translation]] of written text. Usually, during the process of creating subtitles for a film or television program, the picture and each sentence of the audio are analyzed by the subtitle translator; also, the subtitle translator may or may not have access to a written transcript of the dialog. Especially in the field of commercial subtitles, the subtitle translator often interprets what is meant, rather than translating the manner in which the dialog is stated; that is, the meaning is more important than the form—the audience does not always appreciate this, as it can be frustrating for people who are familiar with some of the spoken language; spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied meanings that cannot be conveyed in the written subtitles. Also, the subtitle translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable reading speed, whereby purpose is more important than form.

Especially in [[fansub]]s, the subtitle translator may translate both form and meaning. The subtitle translator may also choose to display a note in the subtitles, usually in [[parentheses]] (“[[wikt:(|(]]” and “[[wikt:)|)]]”), or as a separate block of on-screen text—this allows the subtitle translator to preserve form and achieve an acceptable reading speed; that is, the subtitle translator may leave a note on the screen, even after the character has finished speaking, to both preserve form and facilitate understanding. For example, the Japanese language has multiple first-person pronouns (see [[Japanese pronouns]]) and each pronoun is associated with a different degree of politeness. In order to compensate during the English translation process, the subtitle translator may reformulate the sentence, add appropriate words and/or use notes.

=== Subtitling ===

==== Real-time ====
Real-time translation subtitling usually involves an interpreter and a stenographer working concurrently, whereby the former quickly translates to the dialog while the latter types; this form of subtitling is rare. The unavoidable delay, typing errors, lack of editing, and high cost mean that real-time translation subtitling is in low demand. Allowing the interpreter to directly speak to the viewers is usually both cheaper and quicker; however, the translation is not accessible to people who are deaf and hard-of-hearing.

==== Offline ====
Some subtitlers purposely provide edited subtitles or captions to match the needs of their audience, for learners of the spoken dialog as a second or foreign language, visual learners, beginning readers who are deaf or hard of hearing and for people with learning and/or mental disabilities. For example, for many of its films and television programs, [[PBS]] displays  standard captions representing speech the program audio, word-for-word, if the viewer selects "CC1" by using the television remote control or on-screen menu; however, they also provide edited captions to present simplified sentences at a slower rate, if the viewer selects "CC2". Programs with a diverse audience also often have captions in another language. This is common with popular Latin American [[soap opera]]s in Spanish. Since CC1 and CC2 share [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) recommends translation subtitles be placed in CC3. CC4, which shares bandwidth with CC3, is also available, but programs seldom use it.

=== Subtitles vs. dubbing and lectoring ===
The two alternative methods of 'translating' films in a foreign language are [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]], in which other actors record over the voices of the original actors in a different language, and [[Voice-over translation|lectoring]], a form of [[voice-over]] for fictional material where a narrator tells the audience what the actors are saying while their voices can be heard in the background. Lectoring is common for television in Russia, Poland, and a few other East European countries, while cinemas in these countries commonly show films dubbed or subtitled.

The preference for dubbing or subtitling in various countries is largely based on decisions taken in the late 1920s and early 1930s. With the arrival of sound film, the film importers in [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Spain]] decided to dub the foreign voices, while the rest of Europe elected to display the dialog as translated subtitles. The choice was largely due to financial reasons (subtitling is more economical and quicker than dubbing), but during the 1930s it also became a political preference in Germany, Italy and Spain; an expedient form of [[censorship]] that ensured that foreign views and ideas could be stopped from reaching the local audience, as dubbing makes it possible to create a dialogue which is totally different from the original. In larger German cities a few "special cinemas" use subtitling instead of dubbing.

Dubbing is still the norm and favored form in these four countries, but the proportion of subtitling is slowly growing, mainly to save cost and turnaround-time, but also due to a growing acceptance among younger generations, who are better readers and increasingly have a basic knowledge of English (the dominant language in film and TV) and thus prefer to hear the original dialogue.

Nevertheless, in Spain, for example, only public TV channels show subtitled foreign films, usually at late night. It is extremely rare that any Spanish TV channel shows subtitled versions of TV programs, series or documentaries. With the advent of digital land broadcast TV, it has become common practice in Spain to provide optional audio and subtitle streams that allow watching dubbed programmes with the original audio and subtitles. In addition, only a small proportion of cinemas show subtitled films. Films with dialogue in Galician, Catalan or Basque are always dubbed, not subtitled, when they are shown in the rest of the country. Some non-Spanish-speaking TV stations subtitle interviews in Spanish; others do not.

In many [[Latin America]]n countries, local network television will show dubbed versions of English-language programs and movies, while cable stations (often international) more commonly broadcast subtitled material. Preference for subtitles or dubbing varies according to individual taste and reading ability, and theaters may order two prints of the most popular films, allowing moviegoers to choose between dubbing or subtitles. Animation and children's programming, however, is nearly universally dubbed, as in other regions.

Since the introduction of the DVD and, later, the Blu-ray Disc, some high budget films include the simultaneous option of ''both'' subtitles and/or dubbing. Often in such cases, the translations are made separately, rather than the subtitles being a verbatim transcript of the dubbed scenes of the film. While this allows for the smoothest possible flow of the subtitles, it can be frustrating for someone attempting to learn a foreign language.

In the traditional subtitling countries, dubbing is generally regarded as something strange and unnatural and is only used for animated films and TV programs intended for pre-school children. As animated films are "dubbed" even in their original language and ambient noise and effects are usually recorded on a separate sound track, dubbing a low quality production into a second language produces little or no noticeable effect on the viewing experience. In dubbed live-action television or film, however, viewers are often distracted by the fact that the audio does not match the actors' lip movements.  Furthermore, the dubbed voices may seem detached, inappropriate for the character, or overly expressive, and some ambient sounds may not be transferred to the dubbed track, creating a less enjoyable viewing experience.

=== Subtitling as a practice ===
In several countries or regions nearly all foreign language TV programs are subtitled, instead of dubbed, notably in:

* [[Albania]] (most all foreign-language shows are subtitled in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], children's movies and TV shows are dubbed, mostly animated)
* [[Argentina]] (cable/satellite TV and cinemas)
* [[Armenia]] (Subtitles in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], children's shows principally are dubbed)
*[[Arab world|Arab Middle East and North Africa]] -- [[Modern Standard Arabic]]-language subtitling, used for foreign programming/cinema and often used when Arabic dialects are the primary medium of a film/TV program. Countries such as Lebanon, Algeria, and Morocco also often include French subtitling simultaneously.
* [[Australia]] (especially by [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]])
* [[Belgium]] (Subtitles in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in [[Flanders]], dubbed into [[French language|French]] in [[Wallonia]], bilingual [Dutch-French] subtitles in Flemish and Brussels movie theaters, dubbed versions in Wallonia. Children's shows and teleshopping are dubbed)
* [[Bolivia]]
* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (Children's shows are dubbed in Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian, everything else subtitled in Bosnian)
* [[Brazil]] (some cinemas and cable channels use [[Brazilian Portuguese]] subtitles)
* [[Chile]] (cable/satellite TV only)
* [[China]] (Most Chinese language programming includes subtitles in Chinese, since many languages and dialects are spoken by the populace, but the writing system is independent of dialects)
* [[Colombia]] (cable/satellite TV only)
* [[Cuba]]
* [[Costa Rica]] (cable/satellite TV, and on some national channels like Channel 7)
* [[Croatia]] (Children's shows are dubbed in Croatian, everything else is subtitled in Croatian)
* [[Denmark]] ([[Danish language|Danish]] subtitles in all foreign programmes except children's shows)
* [[Estonia]] ([[Estonian language]] subtitles are used in foreign films and television programmes except for children's media)
* [[Finland]] (Subtitles in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Swedish language|Swedish]], Finland is [[Languages of Finland|bilingual]]; in TV children′s programs are dubbed and off-screen narration in documentaries is often dubbed)
* [[Greece]] (only children's shows and films are dubbed)
* [[Hong Kong]] (Dubbing in [[Cantonese]] often happens, but subtitling is also common, since these foreign programs are often broadcast in multiple languages)
* [[Iceland]] (Subtitles in Icelandic. Television programming and motion pictures directed towards children are dubbed, although cinemas often offer subtitled late-evening screenings of the latter. The off-screen narration in documentaries may be dubbed, although on-screen dialogue are always subtitle)
* [[India]] (Most English channels now give subtitles of their programmes in English)
* [[Indonesia]] (Subtitles in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], some foreign movies have subtitles of more than one language)
* [[Iran]] (Subtitles in [[Persian language|Persian]])
* [[Ireland]], (Subtitles in English for non-English programmes, including those in the [[Irish language]]. Occasional subtitles in [[Irish language]] for programmes shown on the Irish language channel: [[TG4]])
* [[Israel]] (Non-Hebrew television programmes and films are always translated into Hebrew with subtitles. Bilingual Hebrew/Arabic or Hebrew/Russian subtitling, showing translation into both languages simultaneously, is common on public TV channels. Dubbing is restricted to programmes and films aimed at children below school age. As of 2008 the closed captioning industry in Israel is on the rise since a law has been approved, stating that all the Hebrew programmes of The Israeli Television must be subtitled for the hearing impaired. Moreover, in recent years it became a norm in other channels and broadcasting bodies in Israel)
* [[Japan]] (side-by-side with dubs)
* [[Latvia]] (Subtitles in [[Latvian language|Latvian]], occasionally in Latvian language shows or simply in [[Russian language|Russian]] language channels in Russian)
* [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] (Children's program dubbed in Macedonian or Serbian, everything other subtitled in Macedonian)
* [[Malaysia]] (Subtitles in Malay for programming in English and vernacular languages such as Chinese and Tamil and foreign languages such as Hindi and Korean except certain programmes dubbed into Malay such as anime, news programmes in respective vernacular languages (news reports in vernacular language news programmes with foreign people speaking are translated in subtitles) and certain Malay-language live action programs subtitled in English. Also appearing for programming in Indonesian since 2006 except for news reports in Malay news programmes that have Indonesian people speaking where they are not subtitled. All movies on 35&amp;nbsp;mm film subtitled in Malay and Simplified Chinese. Usually, animation and 3D movies are exempted from subtitling (though studios may choose to add subtitles at their discretion). Indian and Chinese movies usually have subtitles of more than one languages)
* [[Montenegro]] (Subtitles in Montenegrin, children's shows dubbed in Serbian; Serbian subtitles imported frequently)
* [[Myanmar]]
* [[Netherlands]] (Subtitles in Dutch, children's shows are dubbed)

The off-screen narration in documentaries may be dubbed, although on-screen dialogue are always subtitled)
* [[Peru]] (in [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]])
* [[Poland]] (almost all live-action movies in cinemas are subtitled; some PG-13 movies can be found in two versions, with subtitles and dubbing)
* [[Portugal]] (Most shows are subtitled in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], but children's shows and documentaries are usually dubbed)
* [[Romania]] (Subtitles in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], no series dubbed)

* [[South Korea]] (Subtitles in [[Korean language|Korean]])
* [[Sweden]] (Subtitles in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Television programming and motion pictures directed towards children are dubbed, although cinemas often offer subtitled late-evening screenings of the latter. The off-screen narration in documentaries may be dubbed, although on-screen dialogue are always subtitled)
* [[Taiwan]] (Mandarin subtitles appear on most shows and all news or live action broadcasts)
* [[Turkey]] (Ethnical languages of the country in [[TRT 3]])
* [[Ukraine]] (TV shows in Russian are often shown with [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] subtitles)
* [[United Kingdom]]
* [[United States]] 
* [[Uruguay]] (cable/satellite TV only)
* [[Venezuela]] (cable/satellite TV only)

It is also common that television services in minority languages subtitle their programs in the dominant language as well. Examples include the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[S4C]] and [[Irish language|Irish]] [[TG4]] who subtitle in [[English language|English]] and the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] [[Yle Fem]] in Finland who subtitle in the majority language [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

In [[Wallonia]] (Belgium) films are usually dubbed, but sometimes they are played on two channels at the same time: one dubbed (on La Une) and the other subtitled (on La Deux), but this is no longer done as frequently due to low ratings.

In Australia, one [[free-to-air|FTA]] network, [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] airs its foreign-language shows subtitled in English.

== Categories ==
Subtitles in the same language on the same production can be in different categories:

* '''Hearing Impaired''' subtitles (sometimes abbreviated as HI or [[Subtitle (captioning)#SDH|SDH]]) are intended for people who are hearing impaired, providing information about music, environmental sounds and off-screen speakers (e.g. when a doorbell rings or a gunshot is heard). In other words, they indicate the kinds and the sources of the sounds coming from the movie, and usually put this information inside brackets to demarcate it from actors' dialogs. For example: [sound of typing on a keyboard], [mysterious music], [glass breaks], [woman screaming].
* '''Narrative''' is the most common type of subtitle in which spoken dialogue is displayed. These are most commonly used to translate a film with one spoken language and the text of a second language.
* '''Forced''' subtitles are common on movies and only provide subtitles when the characters speak a foreign or [[alien language]], or a sign, flag, or other text in a scene is not translated in the localization and dubbing process. In some cases, foreign dialogue may be left untranslated if the movie is meant to be seen from the point of view of a particular character who does not speak the language in question.
* '''Content''' subtitles are a North American Secondary Industry (non-Hollywood, often low-budget) staple. They add content dictation that is missing from filmed action or dialogue. Due to the general low-budget allowances in such films, it is often more feasible to add the overlay subtitles to fill in information. They are most commonly seen on America's Maverick films as forced subtitles, and on Canada's MapleLeaf films as optional subtitles. Content subtitles also appear in the beginning of some higher-budget films (e.g., [[Star Wars]]) or at the end of a film (e.g., [[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]).
* '''Titles only''' are typically used by dubbed programs and provide only the text for any untranslated on-screen text. They are most commonly forced (see above).
* '''Bonus''' subtitles are an additional set of text blurbs that are added to DVDs. They are similar to [[Blu-ray Disc]]s' in-movie content or to the "info nuggets" in VH1 [[Pop-up Video]]. Often shown in popup or balloon form, they point out background, behind-the-scenes information relative to what is appearing on screen, often indicating filming and performance mistakes in continuity or consistency.
* '''Localized''' subtitles are a separate subtitle track that uses expanded references (i.e., "The sake [a Japanese Wine] was excellent as was the Wasabi") or can replace the standardized subtitle track with a [[language localization|localized]] form replacing references to local custom (i.e., from above, "The wine was excellent as was the spicy dip").
* '''Extended/Expanded''' subtitles combine the standard subtitle track with the localization subtitle track. Originally found only on Celestial DVDs in the early 2000s, the format has expanded to many export-intended releases from China, Japan, India, and Taiwan. The term "Expanded Subtitles" is owned by Celestial, with "Extended Subtitles" being used by other companies.
* '''3D''' subtitles combine the standard subtitle position along the X and Y axis of the picture, with a third position along the Z-axis.  This third positioning allows the subtitle to "float" in front of the 3D image.  This option is available in Digital Cinema and in 3D Blu-ray releases.

== Types ==
Subtitles exist in two forms; '''open''' subtitles are 'open to all' and cannot be turned off by the viewer; '''closed''' subtitles are designed for a certain group of viewers, and can usually be turned on/off or selected by the viewer – examples being teletext pages, US Closed captions (608/708), DVB Bitmap subtitles, DVD/Blu-ray subtitles.

While distributing content, subtitles can appear in one of 3 types:

* '''Hard''' (also known as '''hardsubs''' or '''open''' subtitles). The subtitle text is irreversibly merged in original video frames, and so no special equipment or software is required for playback. Hence, complex transition effects and animation can be implemented, such as [[karaoke]] song lyrics using various colors, fonts, sizes, animation (like a [[bouncing ball (music)|bouncing ball]]) etc. to follow the lyrics. However, these subtitles cannot be turned off unless the original video is also included in the distribution as they are now part of the original frame, and thus it is impossible to have several variants of subtitling, such as in multiple languages.
* '''Prerendered''' (also known as '''closed''') subtitles are separate video frames that are overlaid on the original video stream while playing. Prerendered subtitles are used on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] (though they are contained in the same file as the video stream). It is possible to turn them off or have multiple language subtitles and switch among them, but the player has to support such subtitles to display them. Also, subtitles are usually encoded as images with minimal bitrate and number of colors; they usually lack [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliased]] [[font rasterization]]. Also, changing such subtitles is hard, but special [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] software, such as [[SubRip]] exists to convert such subtitles to "soft" ones.
* '''Soft''' (also known as '''softsubs''' or '''closed''' subtitles) are separate instructions, usually a specially marked up text with time stamps to be displayed during playback. It requires player support and, moreover, there are multiple incompatible (but usually reciprocally convertible) subtitle file formats. Softsubs are relatively easy to create and change, and thus are frequently used for [[fansub]]s. Text rendering quality can vary depending on the player, but is generally higher than prerendered subtitles. Also, some formats introduce [[text encoding]] troubles for the end-user, especially if different languages are used simultaneously (for example, Latin and Asian scripts).

In other categorization, digital video subtitles are sometimes called '''internal''', if they are embedded in a single video file container along with video and audio streams, and '''external''' if they are distributed as separate file (that is less convenient, but it is easier to edit/change such file).

There are still many more uncommon formats. Most of them are text-based and have the extension .txt.

=== For media ===
For cinema movies shown in a theatre:
* [[Film|Cinema]]
* [[Digital cinema|D-Cinema]]: digital projection of movie in [[Digital Cinema Package|DCP]] format

For movies on DVD Video:
* [[DVD-Video]] subtitles
* [[Blu-ray Disc]] subtitles

For TV broadcast:
* [[Teletext]]
* [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] Subtitles
* [[Philips Overlay Graphics Text]]
* [[Imitext]]

Subtitles created for TV broadcast are stored in a variety of file formats. The majority of these formats are proprietary to the vendors of subtitle insertion systems.

Broadcast subtitle formats include:

.ESY
.XIF
.X32
.PAC
.RAC
.CHK
.AYA
.890
.CIP
.CAP
.ULT
.USF
.CIN
.L32
.ST4
.ST7
.TIT
.STL

The [[EBU]] format defined by Technical Reference 3264-E&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Specification of the EBU Subtitling data exchange format|url=http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3264.pdf|work=Specification of the EBU Subtitling data exchange format|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=10 March 2013|format=PDF|date=February 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an 'open' format intended for subtitle exchange between broadcasters. Files in this format have the extension .stl (not to be mixed up with text "Spruce subtitle format" mentioned above, which also has extension .stl)

For internet delivery:
* [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]]
* [[Timed Text Markup Language|TTML]]/[[DFXP]]
** [[SMPTE-TT]]/[[CFF-TT]] (for [[UltraViolet (system)|UltraViolet]]-compatible players)
** [[EBU-TT]]

The Timed Text format currently a "Candidate Recommendation" of the [[W3C]] (called [[DFXP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/|work=Timed Text Working Group|accessdate=10 March 2013|author=Philippe Le Hégaret|author2=Sean Hayes |date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is also proposed as an 'open' format for subtitle exchange and distribution to media players, such as Microsoft [[Silverlight]].

== Reasons for not subtitling a foreign language ==
Most times a foreign language is spoken in film, subtitles are used to translate the dialogue for the viewer. However, there are occasions when foreign dialogue is left unsubtitled (and thus incomprehensible to most of the target audience). This is often done if the movie is seen predominantly from the viewpoint of a particular character who does not speak the language. Such absence of subtitles allows the audience to feel a similar sense of incomprehension and [[Social alienation|alienation]] that the character feels. An example of this is seen in ''[[Not Without My Daughter (film)|Not Without My Daughter]]''. The [[Persian language]] dialogue spoken by the Iranian characters is not subtitled because the main character [[Betty Mahmoody]] does not speak Persian and the audience is seeing the film from her viewpoint.

A variation of this was used in the video game ''[[Max Payne 3]]''. Subtitles are used on both the English and Portuguese dialogues, but the latter is left untranslated&lt;ref name="maxpayne3subtitles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entdepot.com/2012/06/01/xbox-360-review-max-payne-3/|title=(Xbox 360 Review) Max Payne 3 |publisher=The Entertainment Depot|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the main character doesn't understand the language.

== Subtitles as a source of humor ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
Occasionally, movies will use subtitles as a source of humor, parody and satire.

* In ''[[Annie Hall]]'', the characters of [[Woody Allen]] and [[Diane Keaton]] are having a conversation; their real thoughts are shown in subtitles.
* In ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]] dialog is subtitled using white type that blends in with white objects in the background. An example is when white binders turn the subtitle "I have a huge rodent problem" into "I have a huge rod." After many cases of this, Mr. Roboto says "Why don't I just speak English?", in English. In the same film, Austin and Nigel Powers directly speak in [[Cockney English]] to make the content of their conversation unintelligible; subtitles appear for the first part of the conversation, but then cease and are replaced with a series of question marks.
* In ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', the Beatles use the subtitles of "[[All you need is love]]" to defeat a giant glove.
* In ''[[The Impostors]]'', one character speaks in a foreign language, while another character hides under the bed. Although the hidden character cannot understand what is being spoken, he can read the subtitles. Since the subtitles are overlaid on the film, they appear to be reversed from his point of view. His attempt to puzzle out these subtitles enhances the humor of the scene.
* The movie ''[[Airplane!]]'' and its sequel feature two inner-city [[African American]]s speaking in heavily accented slang, which another character refers to as if it were a foreign language: "[[African American Vernacular English|Jive]]".  Subtitles translate their speech, which is full of colorful expressions and mild profanity, into bland [[standard English]], but the typical viewer can understand enough of what they are saying to recognize the incongruity. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040528112358/http://larry.teamoverkill.com/jive/ Transcript of the dialog]
* In ''[[Cars 2]]'', Susie Chef and Mater speak Chinese with English subtitles and Luigi, Mama Lopolino and Uncle Topolino speak Italian with English subtitles.
* In parodies of the German film ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Der Untergang]]'', incorrect subtitles are deliberately used, often with offensive and humorous results.
* In the [[Carl Reiner]] comedy ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'', after stopping Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr ([[Steve Martin]]) for speeding, a German police officer realizes that Hfuhruhurr can speak English. He asks his colleague in their squad car to turn off the subtitles, and indicates toward the bottom of the screen, commenting that "This is better&amp;nbsp;— we have more room down there now".
* In the opening credits of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', the Swedish subtitler switches to English and promotes his country, until the introduction is cut off and the subtitler "sacked".  In the DVD version of the same film, the viewer could choose, instead of hearing aid and local languages, lines from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry IV, part 2]]'' that vaguely resemble the lines that are actually being spoken in film, if they are "''people who hate the film''".
* In ''[[Scary Movie 4]]'', there is a scene where the actors speak in faux [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (nonsensical words which mostly consist of Japanese company names), but the content of the subtitles is the "real" conversation.
* In ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'', the nude [[foreign exchange student]] character Areola speaks lightly accented English, but her dialog is subtitled anyway. Also, the text is spaced in such a way that a view of her bare breasts is unhindered.
* In ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', the leading characters have a conversation in a crowded club. To understand what is being said, the entire dialog is subtitled.
* [[Simon Ellis (film director)|Simon Ellis]]' 2000 short film ''Telling Lies'' juxtaposes a soundtrack of a man telling lies on the telephone against subtitles which expose the truth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A7079510 BBC – Film Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831221429/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A7079510 |date=August 31, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Animutation]]s commonly use subtitles to present the comical [[mondegreen|"fake lyrics"]] (English words that sound close to what is actually being sung in the song in the non-English language). These fake lyrics are a major staple of the Animutation genre.
* ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' contains a scene spoken entirely in [[cockney rhyming slang]] that is subtitled in standard English.
* In an episode of ''[[Angry Beavers]]'', at one point Norbert begins to speak with such a heavy European accent that his words are subtitled on the bottom of the screen. Daggett actually touches the subtitles, shoving them out of the way.
* In the American theatrical versions of [[Night Watch (2004 film)|''Night Watch'']] and ''[[Day Watch (film)|Day Watch]]'', Russian dialogues are translated by subtitles which are designed accordingly to the depicted events. For instance, subtitles dissolve in water like blood, tremble along with a shaking floor or get cut by sword.
* The film ''[[Crank (film)|Crank]]'' contains a scene where [[Jason Statham]]'s character understands an Asian character's line of dialogue from reading the on-screen subtitle. The subtitle is even in reverse when his character reads the line. Later, an exclamation made by another Asian character is subtitled, but both the spoken words and the subtitles are in Chinese.
* In ''[[Fatal Instinct]]'', also directed by [[Carl Reiner]], one scene involving two characters talking about their murder plan in Yiddish to prevent anyone from knowing about it, only to be foiled by a man on the bench reading the on-screen subtitles.
* [[Ken Loach]] released the film ''[[Riff-Raff]]'' into American theatres with subtitles not only so people could understand the thick Scottish accents, but also to make fun of what he believes to be many Americans' need for them (mentioned in the theatrical trailer). Many of Loach's films contain traditional dialect, with some (e.g. ''[[The Price of Coal]]'') requiring subtitles even when shown on television in England.
* In [[Bobby Lee]]'s "Tae Do," a [[parody]] of Korean dramas in a ''[[Mad TV]]'' episode, the subtitles make more sense of the story than the Korean language being spoken.  The subtitles are made to appear as though written by someone with a poor understanding of grammar and are often intentionally made longer than what they actually say in the drama. For example, an actor says "Sarang" ("I love you"), but the subtitle is  so long that it covers the whole screen.
* In television series [[Skithouse]], a journalist interviews a group of Afghan terrorists in English, but one of them gets subtitled and sees it. He gets mad because he takes as an insult that he is the only one to get subtitled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFPm2fhB2pI|title=Skithouse: News report from Iraq|date=5 August 2007|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Mel Brooks]] film ''[[Men in Tights]]'', the thoughts of Broomhilde's (Megan Cavanaugh) horse [[Farfelkugel]] are shown as subtitles when Broomhilde attempts to jump on saddle off balcony. As Farfelkugel shudders, the showtitles show "She must be kidding!"
* In the television series ''[[Drawn Together]]'', the character Ling-Ling can only be understood through English subtitles, as his dialogue is delivered in a nonexistent language referred to as "Japorean" by [[Abbey DiGregorio]], the voice actress for the character.
* In the television series ''[[Green Acres]]'' episode “Lisa's Mudder Comes for a Visit” (season 5 episode 1), Lisa and her mother converse in Hungarian, with English Subtitles.  First, Lisa looks down and corrects the subtitles, “No no no, I said you hadn't changed a bit! We have a lot of trouble here with subtitles.”, and they change.  Mother's Japanese chauffeur asks “I begga pardon – I bringa bags inna house?” that elicits a gong sound and Japanese subtitles. This is followed by Mother’s great Dane barking with the subtitles “I've seen better doghouses than this” with Lisa responding “We're not interested in what the dog says”, and the subtitles disappear. Later, the subtitles ask farmhand Eb if they will be needing any more subtitles for the episode.
* In the UK television series ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', in episode 6 of Series 13, they purposely mistranslate the song sung by [[Carla Bruni]], having her supposedly denouncing hatred towards the trio of presenters ("but mainly [[James May]]") for destroying what is claimed to be her own [[Morris Marina]].
* In Vance Joy's music video "Riptide" it shows a woman singing the lyrics to the song. At many points the lyrics which are sung "I got a lump in my throat cause you're gonna sing the words wrong"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/riptide-lyrics-vance-joy.html|title=Vance Joy – Riptide Lyrics – MetroLyrics|work=metrolyrics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; are deliberately mis-subtitled as "I got a lump in my throat cause you gone and sank the worlds wolf"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ_1HMAGb4k|title=Vance Joy – 'Riptide' Official Video|date=2 April 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s music video for "[[Smells Like Nirvana]]", the second verse is subtitled as a way to mock the supposed unintelligibility of the song. One of the lines is "It's hard to bargle nawdle zouss???" (with three question marks), which has no meaning, but is explained by the following line, "With all these marbles in my mouth". While singing the latter, Yankovic indeed spits out a couple of marbles.

One unintentional source of humor in subtitles comes from illegal DVDs produced in non-English-speaking countries (especially China).  These DVDs often contain poorly worded subtitle tracks, possibly produced by [[machine translation]], with humorous results.  One of the better-known examples is a copy of ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' whose opening title was subtitled, "Star war: The backstroke of the west".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=episode iii, the backstroke of the west|url=http://winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html|work=winterson.com|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=10 March 2013|author=jeremy|date=6 July 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516224348/http://www.winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html|archivedate=16 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
Many words such as "Mum/Mom", "pyjamas/pajamas", and so on, are commonly spelled according to the accent or national origin of the person speaking, rather than the language, country, or market the subtitles were created for.  For example, a British film released in the United States might use "Mum" when a British character is speaking, while using "Mom" when an American character is speaking.

'''Phone captioning''' is a free service provided by the US government in which specially trained operators provide transcriptions for hearing-impaired telephone users.

'''Tamra Mercieca''' (born 29 September 1980) is an [[Australian people|Australian]] [[author]], [[therapist]], and founder of [[Getting Naked Pty Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettingnaked.com.au Getting Naked Pty Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

She spent ten years working in radio as a [[news presenter|newsreader]] and [[journalist]] at 5RM Berri, [[Hot FM Townsville]], 104.7 Canberra, [[Triple M Melbourne]], [[SBS Radio]], and Gold FM Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamramercieca.com/about/|title=About Me - Tamra Mercieca|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
It was in 2002, Mercieca won the Australian Commercial Radio Award for Best News Presenter in a provincial market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acras.com.au/ACRAs/media/ACRAs-Media/Awards-Downloads/2002-ACRAs-Winners-List.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Mercieca also had walk on roles in various television shows such as [[Neighbours]], [[Last Man Standing (Australian TV series)|Last Man Standing]] and '[[The Secret Life Of Us]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamramercieca.com/about/ |title=About Me |publisher=Tamra Mercieca |date= |accessdate=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing from a young age, it wasn’t until her own battle with [[depression (mood)|depression]], that she was inspired to pen her first book, ''The Upside Of Down'': A personal journey and toolkit for overcoming depression,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gettingnaked.com.au/shop/books-2/book-the-upside-of-down-a-personal-journey-and-toolkit-for-overcoming-depression/ ]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; self-published in Australia in 2009. The book was endorsed by [[Lifeline Australia]] – the organisation asking her to become an [[advocate]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lifeline.org.au/About-Lifeline/Celebrity-Ambassadors/Consumer-Advocates/Lifeline-National-Consumer-Advocates ]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Mercieca’s recovery and discoveries that led her to become trained in various skills, acquiring a Life and Business certificate in Coaching, before going on to learn the art of neurolinguistics programming, timeline therapy, [[hypnosis]] and whole brain intelligence &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gettingnaked.com.au/about/naked-therapists/tamra/ |title=Tamra Mercieca |publisher=Getting Naked |date= |accessdate=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (she is also accredited with the relevant boards in America).

===Naked therapy===
Combining all of these techniques (along with extensive study into a range of other psychological healing modalities) and developing some of her own, she labelled her new therapy, Naked Therapy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gettingnaked.com.au/personal-sessions-2/naked-therapy-explained/|title=Naked Therapy Explained - Getting Naked|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; going on to launch her own company Getting Naked Pty Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettingnaked.com.au ]&lt;/ref&gt; where she runs tele courses, workshops and does one-on-one sessions, all designed to strip back the layers on what’s stopping a person having complete [[self-love]] and self-belief.

It was while using herself, once again as a guinea pig, to find her Prince, that she learnt: ‘The most important relationship is the relationship you have with yourself.’ This formed the basis for her second book, Getting Naked – The Dating Game &lt;ref&gt;[http://gettingnaked.com.au/shop/books-2/book-getting-naked-the-dating-game-by-tamra-mercieca/ ]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2011), where she navigates her way through the dating landscape of flirtatious flings and romantic rendezvous, sharing her intimate tales of finding love.

Mercieca also applies her healing therapy to sexual issues, being invite to be Sexpo Australia’s Relationship Expert &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexpo.com.au/attraction-detail/298/Relationship+Expert+Tamra+Mercieca ]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2013-2015). She has presented keynote talks at the Celebrating Sexuality Sex Camp in Victoria, the Sacred Sex and Consciousness Conference in [[Byron Bay]] as well as the Seven Sisters Festival in Victoria. More recently Mercieca was invited to take to the TED stage and share her journey into self-love.

In 1978, 1979, and 1981 the [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|Music Educators National Conference]] sponsored the '''Ann Arbor Symposium''' on the Applications of Psychology to the Teaching and Learning of Music at the [[University of Michigan]]. The University of Michigan and the [[Theodore Presser Foundation]] were co-sponsors. The purpose of the Symposium was to explore the relationship between research in certain areas of [[behavioral psychology]] and [[music education]]. 

==Sessions==

In Session I (1978), papers were presented by leading music education researchers to acquaint the participating [[psychologist]]s with music education practices, and to present issues to which research psychologists might contribute their knowledge and expertise. 

Session II (1979) consisted of presentations of papers by the psychologists on the topics discussed by the music educators the year before. Each presentation in Session I was followed by a response from a psychologist, and in Session II by a music educator.

==Collection==
The library had 9,500 books cataloged in [[LibraryThing]] as of November 2012, and its collection was described as including some rare or unique articles of historical interest that originated as a result of the Occupy protests.&lt;ref name='ALA 2011-11-17'&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://ala.org/ala/newspresscenter/news/pr.cfm?id=8568 | title = ALA alarmed at seizure of Occupy Wall Street library, loss of irreplaceable material | accessdate = November 19, 2011 | date = November 17, 2011 | publisher = [[American Library Association]] | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63J2BDwBW?url=http://ala.org/ala/newspresscenter/news/pr.cfm?id=8568 | archivedate = November 19, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[American Libraries]]'', the library's collection had "thousands of circulating volumes," which included "holy books of every faith, books reflecting the entire political spectrum, and works for all ages on a huge range of topics."&lt;ref name='Zabriskie 2011-11-16' /&gt; A librarian was quoted as saying that "donated books are never rejected, even if they seem at odds with the ideology behind the protest."&lt;ref name='King 2011-10-24'&gt;{{cite news | first = Ritchie | last = King | title = For Quiet Moments Between Protests, a Growing Library | date = October 24, 2011 | url = http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/for-quiet-moments-between-protests-a-growing-library/ | work = The New York Times | accessdate = November 20, 2011 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63KqK9nez?url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/for-quiet-moments-between-protests-a-growing-library/ | archivedate = November 20, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection development policy of the Library, or lack thereof, is this: "It only has two points: everything we have was donated to us, and we accept everything," thus, "not only was the Library for the people, but, as they are responsible for its creation, that it is of the people."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norton|first=Daniel|last2=Henk|first2=Mandy|last3=Fagin|first3=Betsy|last4=Taylor|first4=Jaime|last5=Loeb|first5=Zachary|year=2012|title=Occupy Wall Street librarians speak out|url=|journal=Progressive Librarian|volume=38/39|pages=3–16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Library Working Group of the OWS People's Library worked in a consensus leadership structure, meaning they need at least a 90% agreement among members to make a decision happen.

===Zuccotti Park eviction===
[[File:Egan Nottage Lethem OWS 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|Writers [[Jennifer Egan]], [[Lynn Nottage]] and [[Jonathan Lethem]] giving a reading at the library on November 7, 2011]]
During the early morning of November 15, 2011, [[New York City|city]] workers from the [[New York Police Department|Police Department]] and [[New York City Department of Sanitation|Sanitation Department]] forcibly evicted everyone in the park at that time and loaded their [[personal property|property]] and the 5,500+ book collection into garbage trucks, after a decision by [[Government of New York City|city officials]] and park owners [[Brookfield Office Properties]] using "[[public health]] and [[environmental issue]]s" as justification.&lt;ref name='ALA 2011-11-17' /&gt; The People's Library facility was among the assets seized.&lt;ref name='Witt 2011-11-18'&gt;{{cite news | first = Emily | last = Witt | title = American Library Association Condemns Destruction of OWS People's Library | date = November 18, 2011 | url = http://www.observer.com/2011/11/american-library-association-condemns-destruction-of-ows-peoples-library/ | work = The New York Observer | accessdate = November 19, 2011 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63J1esFlO?url=http://www.observer.com/2011/11/american-library-association-condemns-destruction-of-ows-peoples-library/ | archivedate = November 19, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the police action, observers reportedly saw the library's books being thrown into dumpsters.&lt;ref name='ALA 2011-11-17' /&gt;

New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] stated that the library's collection was safely stored at the sanitation garage on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]], and that it could be retrieved on the following Wednesday.&lt;ref name='Howard 2011-11-16'&gt;{{cite news | first = Greg | last = Howard | title = OWS Library: Thousands of Books Missing, Destroyed | date = November 16, 2011 | url = http://slatest.slate.com/posts/2011/11/16/ows_library_reports_missing_books_property_.html | work = Slate | accessdate = November 19, 2011 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63J4JQsWw?url=http://slatest.slate.com/posts/2011/11/16/ows_library_reports_missing_books_property_.html | archivedate = November 19, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After library representatives returned from the sanitation garage on Wednesday, they posted on the library's website that most of its collection and equipment had been destroyed, damaged or lost. Among the missing or damaged property was the [[tent]] that housed the library (including its necessary [[infrastructure]]), [[laptop]]s and [[rubber stamp]]s bearing [[Seal (device)|marks]] used to identify library resources.&lt;ref name='Witt 2011-11-18' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Howard 2011-11-16' /&gt; In all, library representatives reported recovering 26 [[box]]es of books from the city.&lt;ref name='Attenberg 2011-11-17'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jami | last = Attenberg | title = How I helped rescue the OWS library | date = November 17, 2011 | url = http://www.salon.com/2011/11/17/saving_ows_library/singleton/ | work = Salon | accessdate = November 19, 2011 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63J7AawJ7?url=http://www.salon.com/2011/11/17/saving_ows_library/singleton/ | archivedate = November 19, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A final total of books recovered that were still usable and actually originated with the library was 802, a small fraction of the number seized.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, D., Henk, M., Fagin, B., Taylor, J., &amp; Loeb, Z. (2012). Occupy Wall Street librarians speak out. ''Progressive Librarian, 38/39'', 3-16. Retrieved from ebscohost.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===
The [[American Library Association]] (ALA) issued a statement that the dissolution of the library was "unacceptable" because libraries "serve as the cornerstone of our democracy and must be safeguarded." The ALA added that the "very existence of the People's Library demonstrates that libraries are an organic part of all communities" and that libraries "serve the needs of community members and preserve the record of community history." Of concern was the loss of some rare historical documents and records, which it said are endemic to the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name='ALA 2011-11-17' /&gt; Some of the library's [[reference work|reference materials]] and some of its regular books lost were autographed by their authors, either while visiting the library or through courier to express moral support.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} One such example included ''[[What Work Is]]'', which was signed and donated in person by [[United States Poet Laureate]] [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]] hours before its destruction when the park was cleared.&lt;ref name='Palmer 2011-11-23'&gt;{{cite news | first = Gianna | last = Palmer | title = NYPD raid destroyed thousands of books, Occupy says | date = November 23, 2011 | publisher = [[The Kansas City Star]] | url = http://www.kansascity.com/2011/11/23/3283335/nypd-raid-destroyed-thousands.html | work = McClatchy Newspapers | accessdate = November 24, 2011 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63R449iwy?url=http://www.kansascity.com/2011/11/23/3283335/nypd-raid-destroyed-thousands.html | archivedate = November 24, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive director of [[Common Cause]] said in a statement that the [[Government of New York City|City]] should "replace each title, buying two new copies for each one destroyed" and "for whatever number is unaccounted for, the city should provide Occupy's librarians with funds sufficient to buy twice as many."&lt;ref name='SLJ 2011-11-18' /&gt;&lt;ref name='CC 2011-11-17'&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.commoncause.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4773613&amp;ct=11515683 | title = Mayor Bloomberg should replace books lost in Zucotti Park police raid | accessdate = November 20, 2011 | date = November 17, 2011 | publisher = [[Common Cause]] | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63LZyCsbt?url=http://www.commoncause.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4773613&amp;ct=11515683 | archivedate = November 20, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California, Irvine|UC Irvine]] history professor [[Mark LeVine]] expressed his sentiment that "tents can be replaced, even most personal effects. But destroying books is like destroying the soul of the movement" and filmmaker [[Udi Aloni]] added that "When they disrespect books, they disrespect humankind, and when they destroy books, they destroy the spirit of humanity. The library was great because people gave more than they took. OWS was not just a place for activism, but also a place for education and rethinking; not for just blathering on when you don't know, but being humble and willing to learn. By taking out the library, they've tried to stop that crucial process."&lt;ref name='LeVine 2011-11-17'&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark | last = LeVine | title = The People's Library and the future of OWS | date = November 17, 2011 | url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/11/2011111681642279467.html | work = Al Jazeera | accessdate = November 19, 2011 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63JEusc69?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/11/2011111681642279467.html | archivedate = November 19, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editors at ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]'' mourned the loss of the library's donated electronics and computer equipment, which they believed to have been destroyed by a blunt object.&lt;ref name='2600 2011-11-18'&gt;{{cite news | title = Donated Laptops for "Occupy Wall Street" Destroyed in NYPD Action | date = November 18, 2011 | url = http://www.2600.com/news/view/article/12159 | work = 2600: The Hacker Quarterly | accessdate = November 20, 2011 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63KFfsDSx?url=http://www.2600.com/news/view/article/12159 | archivedate = November 20, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
[[File:St James Park Library Yurt.jpg|A library formed by [[Occupy Toronto]] activists was located in a traditional [[Mongols|Mongolian]] [[Yurt]] at [[Cathedral Church of St. James (Toronto)|St. James Park]] in Canada|thumb|right]]
Efforts to restore the library were initiated shortly after its seizure.&lt;ref name='Zabriskie 2011-11-16' /&gt; The library started a third collection with 100 replacement books, which were subsequently surrounded by police and confiscated by sanitation workers on the night of November 16, 2011.&lt;ref name='Zabriskie 2011-11-16' /&gt;&lt;ref name='LeVine 2011-11-17' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Greenberg 2011-11-18'&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Greenberg | title = Occupy Wall Street Turns a Corner | date = November 18, 2011 | url = http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2011/nov/18/crackdown-zuccotti-occupy-wall-street/ | work = The New York Review of Books | accessdate = November 19, 2011 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63JOHqwfw?url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2011/nov/18/crackdown-zuccotti-occupy-wall-street/ | archivedate = November 19, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth collection was formed on November 17, 2011 and is currently being distributed from mobile carts.&lt;ref name='SLJ 2011-11-18'/&gt;

==Services==
The library used an [[honor system]] to manage returns and originally operated [[24/7]].&lt;ref name='Zabriskie 2011-10-18' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Tharoor 2011-10-25' /&gt; It offered weekly poetry readings on Friday nights, provided a reference service that was frequently staffed by professional librarians, and could attempt to procure materials not held by the People's Library.&lt;ref name='ALA 2011-11-17' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Zabriskie 2011-10-18' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Nader 2011-09-29' /&gt;&lt;ref name='NYDN 2011-10-17'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUFn8kKDwuk | title = Voices from Zuccotti: Steve Syrek, 33 | accessdate = November 20, 2011 | work = The New York Daily News | publisher = [[YouTube]] | quote = I've even got one guy who wants to help us procure any materials we want from the interlibrary loan system, which means we are a legitimate, fully functioning research library. Someone could come here and request an article of any kind and we could theoretically get it for free and give it to them.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library's cataloging system is accessible online at [[LibraryThing]], which donated a free lifetime membership.&lt;ref name='Zabriskie 2011-10-18' /&gt; Prior to the Zuccotti park raid, a lighted reading room, public laptop computers and a [[Wi-Fi]] [[wireless network|network]] were also offered.&lt;ref name='Zabriskie 2011-11-16' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Zabriskie 2011-10-18' /&gt;

==Court case==
On May 24, 2012, the librarians, represented by [[Norman Siegel]], sued the city, mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], police commissioner [[Raymond Kelly]], and sanitation commissioner John Doherty in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2014/04/16/librarian-is-my-occupation-a-history-of-the-peoples-library-of-occupy-wall-street/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869140874&lt;/ref&gt; On April 9, 2013, a New York city court ordered the city to pay $366,700 for the raid in which police destroyed some 5,000 books that were part of the library.&lt;ref name="Raw Story"/&gt;

==Sister libraries==
Since the formation of the library, activists at related protests throughout North America and in Europe have formed several sister libraries.&lt;ref name='Zabriskie 2011-10-18' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Fister 2011-10-27'&gt;{{cite news | first = Barbara | last = Fister | title = Why the Occupy Wall Street Movement Has Libraries | date = October 27, 2011 | url = http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/892578-264/why_the_occupy_wall_street.html.csp | work = Library Journal | accessdate = November 20, 2011 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63KgMq1H4?url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/892578-264/why_the_occupy_wall_street.html.csp | archivedate = November 20, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Saltzman 2011-11-02'&gt;{{cite news | first = Rebecca | last = Saltzman | title = From Spectator to Participant: How the Last Week Changed My Relationship With Occupy Oakland | date = November 2, 2011 | url = http://www.beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=9654 | work = BeyondChron | accessdate = November 20, 2011 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/63KexS6FL?url=http://www.beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=9654 | archivedate = November 20, 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UDOO''' is a [[single-board computer]] with an integrated [[Arduino]] Due compatible [[microcontroller]], designed for computer science education, the world of [[Maker movement |Makers]] and the [[Internet of Things]].

The product was launched on [[Kickstarter]] in April 2013, reaching wide consensus.
"The product line involves three single board computers – UDOO QUAD/DUAL (2013), UDOO NEO (2015), UDOO X86 (2016) – that differ over various aspects, plus the UDOO BLU and the set of UDOO BRICKS."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.udoo.org/discover/ UDOO Product Line]&lt;/ref&gt;

UDOO is a development platform that merges a Dual or Quad Core [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[Freescale]] [[Cortex-A9]] [[i.MX]] 6 CPU, that can run [[Linux]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[operating system|operating systems]], and an Arduino Due compatible board with a dedicated ARM [[Atmel]] [[SAM3X]]8E CPU.

UDOO is a joint effort of Aidilab srl and SECO USA Inc, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in [[interaction design]], [[embedded systems]], [[sensor networks]] and [[cognitive science]].

== History ==
;Kickstarter campaign
The UDOO project was launched on Kickstarter on April 9, 2013 by AidiLab&amp;nbsp;— a Siena University startup&amp;nbsp;— and SECO - an embedded computing firm - and reached the goal of $27,000 in about 40 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/udoo/udoo-android-linux-arduino-in-a-tiny-single-board/posts/450961|title=Update 2: 27k goal! · UDOO: Android Linux Arduino in a tiny single-board computer|publisher=|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.fanpage.it/udoo-il-micro-pc-italiano-che-rivoluziona-la-prototipazione-raggiunge-il-goal-su-kickstarter-in-40-ore/|title=UDOO, il micro-pc italiano che rivoluziona la prototipazione raggiunge il goal su Kickstarter in 40 ore|publisher=|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was well exceeded as 4,172 backers pledged $641,614.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/udoo/udoo-android-linux-arduino-in-a-tiny-single-board/|title=UDOO: Android Linux Arduino in a tiny single-board computer|publisher=|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware ==
The UDOO board is equipped with two CPUs. The Freescale i.MX 6 is an ARM Cortex A9 processor based on ARM v7 instruction set. Next generation graphics and high-definition video are central in the i.MX 6 series. The i.MX 6 series supports up to 1080p60 video playback, enabling exceptional high-quality videos with low power consumption for devices playing high-definition content. The 3D graphics engine in the top of the line i.MX 6 Quad and i.MX 6 Dual processors are capable of providing up to 200 Mt/s, which enables ultra-vivid, realistic graphics critical for multimedia. These applications  combine the power of the main cores with the until-now-untapped potential of the 3D engine to perform computational tasks.

Otherwise Atmel SAM3X implements [[real-time computing]] and allows full compatibility with Arduino Due prototyping board. With this solution UDOO can be used like an Arduino Due microcontroller and programmed in the same way.

They are both stand-alone with different clocks and no shared memory. They both process their tasks asynchronously without any kind of emulation.

They do however share some communication channels:
* a UART Serial (used with Linux)
* a USB OTG Bus (used with Android)	
* all the digital pins of the external Arduino pinout.

=== Processors ===
The i.MX 6 Dual/6 Quad application processors are the latest additions of Freescale Semiconductor to a growing family of multimedia-focused products offering high performance processing optimized for lowest power consumption.
The i.MX 6 Dual/6 Quad processors feature Freescale's advanced implementation of the ARM Cortex-A9 core, which can be interfaced with DDR3-1066, LV-DDR3-1066 and LPDDR2-1066 (single and dual channel) DRAM memory devices.

;Atmel SAM3X
Atmel’s SAM3X/A series is a member of a family of Flash microcontrollers based on the high performance 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 RISC processor.  It operates at a maximum speed of 84&amp;nbsp;MHz and features up to 512 Kbytes of Flash and up to 100 Kbytes of SRAM.  The peripheral set includes a High Speed USB Host and Device port with embedded transceiver, an Ethernet MAC, 2x CANs, a High Speed MCI for SDIO/SD/MMC, an External Bus Interface with NAND Flash controller, 5x UARTs, 2x TWIs, 4x SPIs, as well as 1 PWM timer, 9x general-purpose 32- bit timers, an RTC, a 12-bit ADC and a 12-bit DAC.  The SAM3X/A series is ready for capacitive touch thanks to the QTouch library, offering an easyway to implement buttons, wheels and sliders.  The SAM3X/A architecture is specifically designed to sustain high speed data transfers.  It includes a multi-layer bus matrix as well as multiple SRAM banks, PDC and DMA channels that enable it to run tasks in parallel and maximize data throughput.  It operates from 1.62V to 3.6V and is available in 100- and 144-pin QFP and LFBGA packages.  The SAM3X/A devices are particularly well suited for networking applications: industrial and home/building automation, gateways.

;Processor connectivity
The Freescale i.MX 6 and the Atmel SAM3X are connected through a UART Serial Port embedded on the board. It works exactly like an Arduino connected to an external computer with a USB cable. The SAM3X and Linux communicate on a two way channel, exchanging messages with a tested baudrate of 115200.

This serial connection is also accessible from the external pins 0 and 1 of the Arduino compatible pinout. The SAM3X programming port is accessible in the same way as Arduino Due: via a USB-to-serial converter or directly on the external pinout. The serial UART is connected to the iMX 6 pins KEYROW0 and KEYCOL0. On the SAM3X side it is connected to pins URXD and UTXD. The shared serial is also available through the micro-USB plug CN6. By removing the J18 jumper, you can communicate on the same channel, which now becomes shared.
	
;Memory
UDOO uses 4 Micron MT41J256M16RE-15E RAM modules (2Gbit for each module) for a total of 1GByte. The clock frequency is 400mhz for UDOO Dual and 528mhz for UDOO Quad.

The memory system consists of the following levels:

* Level 1 Cache - 32KB Instruction, 32KB Data cache per each core.	
* Level 2 Cache - Unified instruction and data (1MByte)	
* On-Chip Memory	
* Boot ROM, including HAB (96 KB) 	
* Internal multimedia / shared, fast access RAM (256KByte)
* Secure/non-secure RAM (16 KB)

=== Networking ===
;Ethernet
The MAC-NET core, in conjunction with a 10/100/1000 MAC, implements layer 3 network acceleration functions.  These functions are designed to accelerate the processing of various common networking protocols, such as IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP, providing wire speed services to client applications.  UDOO uses KSZ9031RNX Ethernet transceiver.  It is a completely integrated triple-speed (10BASE-T/100BASE-TX/1000BASE-T) Ethernet physical layer transceiver for transmission and reception of data on standard CAT-5 unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable.  The KSZ9031RNX provides the Reduced Gigabit Media Independent Interface (RGMII) for direct connection to RGMII MACs in Gigabit Ethernet processors and switches for data transfer at 10/100/1000 Mbit/s.  The KSZ9031RNX reduces board costs and simplifies board layout by using on-chip termination resistors for the four differential pairs and by integrating an LDO controller to drive a low-cost MOSFET to supply the 1.2V core.

;Wi-Fi Module
GWF-3M08 is a WLAN module supporting IEEE 802. 11 b/g/n standards with 6-pin connector supporting USB 2.0 /1.1 interface. This is a small form factor and low cost compact WLAN

;LVDS panels
UDOO provides one of the two i.MX 6 LVDS outputs to the external pinout. This input is used to communicate RGB data and controls to external LCD displays with LVDS interface, or through LVDS receivers.

The LVDS port may be used as one single-channel output.

;USB OTG - Android Accessory Mode
When you boot Android, the OTG BUS is switched to connect to the SAM3X; therefore, the connection is between the two processors. If you plug a USB cable to CN3 it doesn’t work since it is disconnected.

With this setup, the i.MX 6 can communicate with the SAM3X using the Android ADK protocol. To do this you must program the SAM3X with a sketch which includes specific libraries and installs an app on Android configured to use the ADK protocol.

Vladimir Betz began his education in the [[Nizhyn]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (Ukraine, part of the Russian Empire at that time). Later he transferred to the 2nd [[Kiev]] Gymnasium and graduated from it in 1853. In 1860 he received a physician's diploma from the Medicine faculty of [[Saint Vladimir University]] in Kiev (now [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]]) and was appointed a [[prosector]]'s aide at the [[anatomy]] department. He went abroad to study in May 1861 and returned in September 1862, having studied with and attended the lectures of professors Brücke, Bunsen, Kölliker, Helmholtz, Kirchhoff. From 1864 to 1867 he lectures anatomy and histology at the university, rising in 1868 to the rank of Extraordinary Professor and in 1870 becoming Ordinary Professor of the anatomy department.

Brain tissue preparations made by Betz were awarded medals twice - at the All-Russian manufacturing exhibition in 1870 and at [[Vienna World Exposition]] of 1873. In 1874, Vladimir Alekseyevich described the giant pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex, which later were named ''[[Betz cell]]s''.&lt;!--

'''Wilfrid Derome''' (19 April 1877 &amp;ndash; 24 November 1931) was a [[Quebec]] [[forensic scientist]] known as the founder of the first [[Forensic science]] laboratory in North America, founded in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Beaudoin, F. Wilfrid Derome, terreur de la classe criminelle, Journal de la Criminalistique, 1(3), 2011, pp 98-100&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory is now called the Laboratoire des Sciences Judiciaires et de Médecine Légale.

==Biography==
Dr. Derome was born in Napierville, Canada and studied at the [[College of Montreal]], Sainte-Marie College, and Joliette Seminary, where he received the Bachelor of Arts in 1898. Later, he received a doctorate of medicine from [[Université de Montréal|Université Laval in Montreal]] in 1902, interning at Notre Dame Hospital.

During 1908-1909, Dr. Derome studied Legal Medicine at the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Côté, J. Wilfrid Derome, expert en homicides, Boréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

During his career, he acted as associate editor the American Journal of Police Science, contributing two articles during 1930. He was a member of the [[International Association for Identification]] and the Société de médecine légale de France.

==Work==
In 1910, Dr. Derome was appointed Professor of Legal Medicine and Toxicology at the University of Montreal and became head of the Laboratory of Notre Dame Hospital.

He founded, in June 1914, the first governmental [[Forensic science]] laboratory in North America in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  He acted as the Director of the lab since his death in 1931 at the age of 54.&lt;ref&gt;Beaudoin, F. Wilfrid Derome, terreur de la classe criminelle, Journal de la Criminalistique, 1(3), 2011, pp 98-100&lt;/ref&gt;  He testified as Medical Expert and Ballistic Expert to the Crown in many legal cases during his career.

In 1922, he became the first Expert in North America to testify in front of the Court on the determination of ethyl alcohol in the blood. In 1926, Dr. Derome invented the microspherometer which can reveal the marks left on the surface of bullets fired from a firearm for the purpose of identification. This discovery allowed to present scientific evidence in Court for the first time in ballistics.&lt;ref&gt;Beaudoin, F. Wilfrid Derome, terreur de la classe criminelle, Journal de la Criminalistique, 1(3), 2011, pp 98-100&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the Derome laboratory was visited by [[J. Edgar Hoover]], from the [[FBI]], in order to plan the foundation of the FBI laboratory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">'''Willie Dee Worley Bowles''' (February 4, 1912 – November 22, 2000) was an  [[United States|American]] educator and historian.  Her 1939 thesis, ''The History of the Woman Suffrage Movement in Texas'', was one of the first attempts to catalogue the history of the [[women's suffrage]] movement in the [[United States]].

Bowles was born Willie Dee Worley in [[Piedmont, Alabama|Piedmont]], [[Alabama]] in 1912, and attended the schools of [[Auburn, Alabama]] and [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]] before beginning her studies at [[Sam Houston State University|Sam Houston State Teachers' College]] in [[Huntsville, Texas]] in 1926.  After graduating from Sam Houston State in 1931, Bowles taught English and Spanish at [[Alief Hastings High School|Alief High School]] near [[Houston, Texas]] until 1934, and then, from 1934 through 1939, taught History at [[Harlingen High School]] in [[Harlingen, Texas]].  Also in 1934, Bowles entered graduate school at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where she graduated in 1939 with a [[masters degree]] in history.  Bowles' thesis, ''The History of the Woman Suffrage Movement in Texas'', was the first historical study of its topic, and one of the first histories of the women's suffrage movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Alicia A. Garza, "[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbogj BOWLES, WILLIE DEE]", ''Handbook of Texas Online'', retrieved November 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowles taught for much of the rest of her life in the schools of [[San Marcos, Texas]], where her husband, Dr. D. Richard Bowles, was a longtime professor of education and director of elementary student training at [[Southwest Texas State University]].  In 1987, Bowles was inducted into the San Marcos Women's Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;City of San Marcos, Texas, ''[http://www.ci.san-marcos.tx.us/departments/parks/Honorees.html Hall of Fame Honorees]'', retrieved November 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Winifred Lamb''' (1894-1963) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[art historian]], [[archeologist]], and museum curator who specialised in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Anatolia]]n cultures and artifacts. The bulk of her career was spent as the Honorary Keeper of Greek Antiquities at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] from 1920 - 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/cockerell/pigstytopalace/antiquities.html   Fitzwilliam Museum Antiquities]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classics in 19th and 20th Century Cambridge: Curriculum, Culture and Community|last=Gill|first=David W.J.|publisher=Cambridge Philological Society|year=1998|isbn=0-906014-23-9|editor-last=Stray|editor-first=Christopher|location=Cambridge|pages=135-156|chapter=Winifred Lamb and the Fitzwilliam Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman archaeologist involved in the British Anatolian excavations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arthistorians.info/lambw|title=Lamb, Winifred|last=|first=|date=2018-02-21|work=Dictionary of Art Historians|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Fitzwilliam museum states that she was a "generous benefactor and raising the profile of the collections through groundbreaking research, acquisitions and publications."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/cockerell/pigstytopalace/antiquities.html   Fitzwilliam Museum Antiquities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Lamb was born on 3 November 1894 at Holly Lodge, Campden Hill, London. She was the daughter of [[Edmund Lamb]], a former [[Member of Parliament]], and Mabel Lamb.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|title=Lamb, Winifred (1894–1963), archaeologist and museum curator {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/67872|work=The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/67872|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winifred Lamb attended [[Newnham College]] of [[Cambridge University]], studying [[Classics]], and earning her degree in 1917. She joined the British Naval Intelligence Department and served throughout [[World War I]], probably working on the decipherment of coded messages sent to German submarines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was here that Lamb met [[John Beazley]], a renowned archaeologist also working in British Intelligence, who encouraged her in her research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arthistorians.info/lambw|title=Lamb, Winifred|last=|first=|date=2018-02-21|work=Dictionary of Art Historians|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her fieldwork and excavation skills were honed at the [[British School at Athens]], which she began attending in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;David W. J. Gill. Anatolian Studies. Vol. 50, (2000)[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3643010   Preview]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Lamb was appointed as the first Honorary Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in [[Cambridge]]; her work there involved arranging new displays and sorting and cataloguing the collections and new acquisitions, as well as enhancing the collections by donating numerous items herself (especially bronzes and pottery) and encouraging others to do so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Key publications from her work at the Fitzwilliam include a book on Greek and Roman bronze statues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Ancient_Greek_and_Roman_Bronzes.html?id=Ghi4AAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Ancient Greek and Roman Bronzes|last=Lamb|first=Winifred|date=1929|publisher=Argonaut|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two volumes of the ''[[Corpus vasorum antiquorum]]'' (corpus of ancient vases).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XPMMuQEACAAJ&amp;dq=winifred+lamb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu36THytbdAhWFsaQKHblUAyEQ6AEIOTAD|title=Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain.

Lamb took part in excavations in [[Mycenae]], [[Sparta]], and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. Following her work in Macedonia, Lamb had started to consider the link between the southern Balkans, the northern Aegean, and northwest Anatolia; her search led her to [[Lesbos]], where in 1928 she identified the site of [[Thermi]].  She led her own excavation on this site from 1929 - 1933, publishing her results as a book in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OolxBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=winifred+lamb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_rtnKy9bdAhVGEVAKHYLoABEQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=winifred%20lamb&amp;f=false|title=Excavations at Thermi in Lesbos|last=Lamb|first=Winifred|date=2014-10-02|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107433106|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She visited the archaeological excavation of Troy in 1930 and 1932, which inspired further work, allowing her to associate Thermi towns IV and V with Troy IIa. She gave a lecture, expanding on these views, as part of the 1936 exhibition at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] on British Archaeological Discoveries in Greece and Crete 1886 - 1936.&lt;ref name=gill110&gt;David W. J. Gill, ''A Rich and Promising Site'': Winifred Lamb (1894 - 1963), Kusura and Anatolian archaeology'' in ''Anatolian Studies'', Vol 50 (2000) pp1-10&lt;/ref&gt; 

After this, she turned her attention to Ankara where, despite the problems for women working in Turkey at this time, other women archaeologists, including [[Gertrude Bell]], [[Margaret Hardie]], and [[Dorothy Lamb]] had excavated before the war.&lt;ref name=gill110/&gt; She excavated at [[Kusura, Sandıklı|Kusura]] in 1936 and 1937, and gave a lecture to the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in London on recent developments in the pre-history of Anatolia in 1937. Her interest in the area eventually helped establish the [[British Institute at Ankara|British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara]], of which she served as honorary secretary from 1948 - 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Getzel M. Cohen, Martha Sharp Joukowsky. Breaking Ground: Pioneering Women Archaeologists. University of Michigan 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; She also published the Anatolian material held by the Fitzwilliam Museum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lamb felt that more excavation was required in Anatolia, but her work was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. In 1941 she joined the Greek language service of the BBC, and from 1942 to 1946 worked for the Turkish section of the Near Eastern department of the BBC. Towards the end of the war she was seriously injured when a V2 rocket hit her lodgings in north London, killing her housemates.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} She continued her work for the Fitzwilliam Museum until 1958, when she resigned in order to focus on her work on Anatolia and her involvement with the [[British Institute at Ankara|British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara]]; her donations and her collecting of items over this period had greatly enhanced the Museum's collections of classical antiquities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She died seven years after her retirement to Borden Wood on 16 September 1963 in Easebourne.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She is the author of numerous books on Greek and Roman antiquities, including the 1929 publication ''Greek and Roman Bronzes'', which was standard reading for studies on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arthistorians.info/lambw|title=Lamb, Winifred|last=|first=|date=2018-02-21|work=Dictionary of Art Historians|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote a number of reviews for the [[Journal of Hellenic Studies]].

'''Young Reporters for the Environment''' is a programme of the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]]. An international network of youth in more than 25 countries, it promotes solutions to today’s environmental issues through [[investigative journalism]].

At the national{{where|date=May 2013}} level, participants choose local environmental issues to investigate, with the goal of communicating relevant information and solutions to the general public. The students carry out real journalistic enquiries and report their findings in the form of an article, photograph/[[Photo-essay|photographic essay]] or video. 

An international competition is also held annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fee-international.org/en/Menu/Programmes/YRE What is YRE?]&lt;/ref&gt;
