The '''A585''' is a primary road in [[England]] which runs from [[Kirkham, Lancashire|Kirkham]] to [[Fleetwood]] in [[Lancashire]].

The road runs a total distance of just under {{Convert|14|mi|km}}, on a mixture of rural and urban residential/commercial streets.  The {{convert|12|mi|adj=on}} section north of the [[M55 motorway|M55]] formerly carried large amounts of [[containerization|container]] traffic to and from the Fleetwood container port, until operations ceased in 2010.  

The road begins at Kirkham, as a turning off the [[A583 road|A583]], the Kirkham [[Bypass (road)|by-pass]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.7824|-2.8941|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A585 road (southern end)}}).}}  It travels north for {{convert|1.5|mi}}, firstly as the Kirkham &amp; Wesham By-Pass, then as Fleetwood Road, through Kirkham and [[Wesham]], till it meets Junction 3 of the [[M55 motorway|M55]] at Wesham Circle.  The road continues as Fleetwood Road in a roughly northerly direction for a further {{convert|3|mi}}, through Esprick and Greenhalgh. This section is rural and fairly winding, although some curves were straightened in the 1970s when container traffic began using the road, most notably the series of bends in Thistleton at the B5269 turnings to [[Singleton, Lancashire|Singleton]] and [[Elswick, Lancashire|Elswick]]. These were notoriously known as 'Hellfire Corner'. 

The road meets the [[A586 road|A586]] Garstang New Road near Larbreck, where it turns west, sharing with the A586 for one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km), until a traffic light controlled junction at Little Singleton. It continues north-west as Mains Lane for a further {{convert|1.5|mi}}, passing the [[A588 road|A588]] turning to Shard Bridge and [[Over Wyre]], then sharing with the A588 until the River Wyre roundabout, where the A588 diverts south-west towards [[Poulton-le-Fylde]]. At this point, the road becomes [[Amounderness]] Way, which was built in the 1970s to allow container traffic to bypass [[Thornton, Lancashire|Thornton]]. It continues through Norcross Roundabout, initially as a national speed limit road until [[Cleveleys]], at which point the speed limit is reduced due to more urban surroundings. The road continues north, acting as a border between Thornton and Cleveleys.

The road then enters Fleetwood, first reaching Broadwater Roundabout, a total distance of about {{convert|4.5|mi}} from the start of the newer section of the road. Broadwater Roundabout is surmounted by a statue of [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]], a copy of that standing in [[Piccadilly Circus]], [[London]]. From here, the road begins its last and newest section, a {{convert|1.5|mi|adj=on}} stretch of Amounderness Way built on the old railway bed in the 1990s. It eventually terminates at the new Ash Street roundabout, near Fleetwood Freeport, where it joins the [[A587 road|A587]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.9191|-3.0144|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A585 road (northern end)}}).}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2991">The '''Trieste AREA Science Park''' is composed of two neighbouring campus developments located near the exit from the motorway linking [[Venice]] to [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]]. It covers 50 hectares, extendable to 150, in the magnificent natural setting of the [[Karst Plateau]].

Operational since 1982, the AREA Science Park was founded with the initial aim of providing a link between the business community and the many high-level international scientific institutions in [[Trieste]]. It is now the most important multi-sector science park in [[Italy]] and one of the foremost in [[Europe]].

The park has about 23,000 sq metres of laboratory space equipped with specialised apparatus, experimental and safety equipment, in addition to offices and service facilities (Conference Centre, meeting rooms, teaching labs, cafeteria, etc.). An additional area of about 1,500 sq metres is currently available for new activities. The following services are also available: information and [[computer]]s, legal, fiscal and accounting consultancy, engineering and plant technology, occupational health and safety, marketing and promotion, information and assistance on EU programmes.

There are incentives for small and medium-sized companies entering into research contracts with the AREA Science Park. They may be direct (contributions to cover costs, in capital or towards interest payments) or in other forms of support (purchase of hired instruments, fellowships, assistance and consultancy services). "Research laboratories whose aim is to promote industry in technologically advanced sectors with a substantial and highly-qualified workforce" intending to establish themselves in the AREA Science Park may also have access to financing provided by Autonomous Region of [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]].

Intensive training of school-leavers and graduates has so far led to jobs for over 100 young people in the research and productive structures within the Science Park or outside it. The fellowships awarded by the Consortium privilege training in the institutes, centres and companies of the Area itself. Under the programmes included in the [[European Commission Objective]] 2, the Consortium supervises the training of graduates in the sector of innovation transfers to create solid bonds between the world of research and small and medium-sized companies.

The Science Park currently has 38 established units, divided into the following sectors:

* highly specialised research and training centres;
* research and development and service centres of outside companies;
* new companies originating from the availability of specialised services, know-how and facilities encouraged by the Park;
* the special [[ELETTRA]] Laboratory project.

'''AS-102''' (also designated '''SA-7''') was the seventh flight of the [[Saturn I]] launch vehicle, which carried the [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] [[Apollo spacecraft]] BP-15 into [[low Earth orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1964-057A NSSDC: ''SA-7'']&lt;/ref&gt; The test took place on September 18, 1964, lasting for five orbits (about seven and a half hours). The spacecraft and its upper stage completed 59 orbits before reentering the atmosphere and crashing in the Indian Ocean on September 22, 1964.

==Objectives==
AS-102 was designed to repeat the flight of [[AS-101]]. It would once again carry a boilerplate Apollo [[Command and Service Module]]. The only difference from Boilerplate 13 carried on AS-101 was that on Boilerplate 15, one of the simulated Reaction Control System thruster quads (attitude control thrusters) was instrumented to record launch temperatures and vibrations. Another major difference on AS-102 was that the [[Launch Escape System]] (LES) tower would be jettisoned using the launch escape and pitch control motors. The mission used Apollo boilerplate BP-15.

AS-102 was the first time a Saturn rocket carried a [[computer programming|programmable]] [[Saturn I#Saturn I Instrument Unit|guidance computer]]. Previous launches had used an onboard "black box" that was preprogrammed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} On AS-102 it would be possible to reprogram the computer during flight so that any anomalous behavior could potentially be corrected.

==Flight==
In early July, a small crack in engine number six was found. This meant removing the engine, the first time that the ground crew had to do this with a Saturn rocket. It was then decided to return all eight engines to the manufacturer, which meant a job that would take about ten hours because of the large number of tubes, hoses and wires that connected each engine to the rocket. The replacement delayed the launch by about two weeks, followed by another delay of several days because of Hurricanes [[Hurricane Cleo|Cleo]] and [[Hurricane Dora|Dora]].

Launch was on 18 September from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy]], Florida just before noon local time. The first stage burned for 147.7 seconds, with separation 0.8 seconds later. The second stage ignited 1.7 seconds later, and the LES jettisoned at 160.2 seconds after launch. It burned until +621.1 seconds with the stage and boilerplate in a 212.66 by 226.50&amp;nbsp;km orbit.

The flight met all its objectives.  The spacecraft continued to transmit telemetry for five orbits and was tracked until re-entry on its 59th orbit over the [[Indian Ocean]].

The only anomalous event on the flight was the failure to recover the eight film-camera pods. They had landed downrange of the expected area, where [[1964 Atlantic hurricane season|Hurricane Gladys]] ruled out a continued search. However, two of the pods did wash ashore two months later. The pods were covered with [[barnacle]]s, but the film inside was undamaged.

The '''African wild ass''' or '''African wild donkey''' (''Equus africanus'') is a wild member of the [[horse]] family, [[Equidae]].&lt;ref name=MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Perissodactyla | id = 14100004 | page = 629}}&lt;/ref&gt; This species is believed to be the ancestor of the domestic [[donkey]], which is usually placed within the same species.&lt;ref name=NatGeo&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=African wild ass is the mother of donkeys, DNA shows |url=http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/news/chiefeditor/2010/08/african-wild-ass-is-ancestor-of-modern-donkeys.html |work=National Geographic Blogspot |publisher=[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]] |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=8 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817025951/http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/news/chiefeditor/2010/08/african-wild-ass-is-ancestor-of-modern-donkeys.html |archivedate=17 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They live in the [[desert]]s and other [[arid]] areas of the [[Horn of Africa]], in [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. It formerly had a wider range north and west into [[Sudan]], [[Egypt]], and [[Libya]]. About 570 individuals exist in the wild.

[[File:Tiergarten Kleve PM16 020.jpg|thumb|upright|Close-up of hindlegs]]
The African wild [[Donkey|ass]] is {{Convert|2|m|ft}} long and {{Convert|1.25|to|1.45|m}} (12 to 14 hands) tall at the shoulders, with a tail {{Convert|30|–|50|cm}} long. It weighs between {{Convert|230|-|275|kg|sigfig=2}}. The short, smooth coat is a light grey to fawn colour, fading quickly to white on the undersides and legs. There is a slender, dark dorsal stripe in all [[subspecies]], while in the [[Nubian wild ass]] (''E. a. africanus''), as well as the domestic donkey, there is a stripe across the shoulder.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The legs of the [[Somali wild ass]] (''E. a. somaliensis'') are horizontally striped with black, resembling those of a [[zebra]].&lt;ref name=StLouis&gt;{{cite web |title=Somali Wild Ass |url=http://www.stlzoo.org/animals/abouttheanimals/mammals/hoofedmammals/somaliwildass.htm |work=About the Animals |publisher=St. Louis Zoo |author=Staff |accessdate=8 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101053308/http://www.stlzoo.org/animals/abouttheanimals/mammals/hoofedmammals/somaliwildass.htm |archivedate=1 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the nape of the neck, there is a stiff, upright mane, the hairs of which are tipped with black.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The ears are large with black margins.

==Evolution==
{{seealso|Evolution of the horse}}
[[File:Equus eisenmannae.JPG|thumb|Skull of a giant extinct horse, ''Equus eisenmannae'']]
The genus ''Equus'', which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from ''[[Dinohippus]]'', via the intermediate form ''[[Plesippus]]''. One of the oldest species is ''[[Hagerman Horse|Equus simplicidens]]'', described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged ''Equus livenzovensis'' documented from western Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name = "Azzaroli1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azzaroli |first=A. |year=1992 |title=Ascent and decline of monodactyl equids: a case for prehistoric overkill |journal=Ann.

Molecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus ''Equus'') lived ~5.6 (3.9–7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recalibrating ''Equus evolution'' using the genome sequence of an early Middle Pleistocene horse |last1=Orlando|first1= L.|last2=Ginolhac|first2= A.|last3=Zhang|first3= G.|last4=Froese|first4= D.|last5=Albrechtsen|first5= A.|last6=Stiller|first6= M.|last7=Schubert|first7= M.|last8=Cappellini|first8= E.|last9=Petersen|first9= B.|journal=Nature|date=4 July 2013 |doi=10.1038/nature12323 |pmid=23803765 |volume=499 |issue=7456 |pages=74–8|display-authors=etal|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/recalibrating-equus-evolution-using-the-genome-sequence-of-an-early-middle-pleistocene-horse(f4a404d6-2202-4a92-90c7-d113aee17b2d).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus ''E.

All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] forms) belong to the subgenus ''E.

==Taxonomy==&lt;!-- sources can be taken from "Opinion 2027" article --&gt;
Different authors consider the African wild ass and the domesticated donkey one or two species; either view is technically legitimate, though the former is [[phylogenetic]]ally more accurate.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The species name for the African wild ass is sometimes given as ''asinus'', from the domestic donkey, whose specific name is older and usually would have priority. But this usage is erroneous since the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] has conserved the name ''Equus africanus'' in [[Opinion 2027]]. This was done to prevent the confusing situation of the phylogenetic ancestor being [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]]ally included in its descendant.

Thus, if one species is recognized, the correct scientific name of the donkey is ''E. africanus asinus''.

The first published name for the African wild ass, ''Asinus africanus'', Fitzinger, 1858, is a [[nomen nudum]].&lt;ref name="Groves 2007"/&gt; The name ''Equus taeniopus'' [[Theodor von Heuglin|von Heuglin]], 1861&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [[Theodor von Heuglin|Heuglin Th. v]] (1861). "Th. v. Heuglin’s Forschungen über die Fauna des Rothen Meeres und der Somáli-Kuste.

Petermann (“Petermann’s Geographische Mittheilungen”)'': 11-32.&lt;/ref&gt; is rejected as indeterminable, as it is based on an animal that cannot be identified and may have been a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a domestic [[donkey]] and a [[Somali wild ass]]; the [[Type (biology)|type]] has not been preserved.&lt;ref name="Groves 2007"/&gt; The first [[available name]] thus becomes ''Asinus africanus'' von Heuglin &amp; Fitzinger, 1866.&lt;ref name="Heuglin 1866"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groves 2007"/&gt; A [[lectotype]] is designated: a skull of an adult female collected by von Heuglin near [[Atbarah River]], Sudan, and present in the [[State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart]], MNS 32026.&lt;ref name="Groves 2007"/&gt; The two subspecies recognized are the [[Nubian wild ass]] ''Equus africanus africanus'' (von Heuglin &amp; Fitzinger, 1866),&lt;ref name="Heuglin 1866"/&gt; and the [[Somali wild ass]] ''Equus africanus somaliensis'' (Noack, 1884).&lt;ref name="Groves 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Noack Th. (1884). "Neues aus der Tierhandlung von Karl Hagenbeck, sowie aus dem Zoologischen Garten in Hamburg". ''Der Zoologische Garten'' '''25''': 100-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
African wild asses are well suited to life in a desert or semidesert environment.&lt;ref name=StLouis/&gt; They have tough digestive systems, which can break down desert vegetation and extract moisture from food efficiently. They can also go without water for a fairly long time. Their large ears give them an excellent sense of hearing and help in cooling.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
Because of the sparse vegetation in their environment wild asses live somewhat separated from each other (except for mothers and young), unlike the tightly grouped herds of wild horses.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; They have very loud voices, which can be heard for over {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}}, which helps them to keep in contact with other asses over the wide spaces of the desert.

==Behavior==
The African wild ass is primarily active in the cooler hours between late afternoon and early morning, seeking shade and shelter amongst the rocky hills during the day. The Somali wild ass is also very agile and nimble-footed, capable of moving quickly across boulder fields and in the mountains. On the flat, it has been recorded reaching speeds of {{convert|70|km/h|abbr=on}}. In keeping with these feats, its soles are particularly hard and its hooves grow very quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marwell.org.uk/zoo_guide/animal_detail.asp?id=86|title="Somali Wild Ass" in the Animal Encyclopaedia at Marwell|work=marwell.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mature males defend large [[Territory (animal)|territories]] around 23 square kilometres in size, marking them with [[Dung hill|dung heap]]s – an essential marker in the flat, monotonous terrain. Due to the size of these ranges, the [[dominant male]] cannot exclude other males. Rather, intruders are tolerated –  recognized and treated as [[subordinate]]s, and kept as far away as possible from any of the resident females. In the presence of estrous females, the males bray loudly. These animals live in loose [[herd]]s of up to fifty individuals.

[[File:Somali Wild Ass mother and foal.jpg|thumb|left|Somali wild ass mother and foal]]
In the wild, breeding of African wild ass occurs in wet season.&lt;ref name=animalinfo&gt;{{cite web|title=African wild ass|url=http://www.animalinfo.org/species/artiperi/equuafri.htm|publisher=Animal Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gestation period lasts for 11 to 12 months, given birth one foal from October to February.&lt;ref name="animalinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name=huffman&gt;{{cite web|last=Reyes|first=E.|title=African wild ass |url=http://www.ultimateungulate.com/perissodactyla/equus_asinus.html|publisher=Ultimate Ungulate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foal weaning on 6 to 8 month after birth, with sexual maturity at 2 years in 2 years after birth.&lt;ref name="huffman"/&gt; Lifespan is up to 40 years in captivity.&lt;ref name="animalinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffman"/&gt;

Wild asses can run swiftly, almost as fast as a horse. However, unlike most hoofed mammals, their tendency is to not flee right away from a potentially dangerous situation, but to investigate first before deciding what to do. When they need to, they can defend themselves with kicks from both their front and hind legs. Equids were used in ancient [[Sumer]] to pull wagons circa 2600 BC, and then [[chariot]]s on the [[Standard of Ur]], circa 2000 BC. These have been suggested to represent [[onager]]s, but are now thought to have been domestic asses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Juliet | last=Clutton-Brock | year=1992 | title=Horse Power: A History of the Horse and the Donkey in Human Societies | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=USA | isbn=978-0-674-40646-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==

[[File:Afrikanischer Esel (Equus asinus), Zoo Hannover.jpg|thumb|Somali wild ass eating hays, at the [[Hanover Zoo]], [[Hanover]], [[Germany]]]]
The African wild asses' diet consists of [[grass]]es, [[Bark (botany)|bark]], and [[leaf|leaves]]. Despite being primarily adapted for living in an arid climate, they are dependent on water, and when not receiving the needed moisture from vegetation, they must drink at least once every three days. However, they can survive on a surprisingly small amount of liquid, and have been reported to drink salty or brackish water.

==Conservation status==
[[File:ZolliWildAss.JPG|180px|thumb|right|Somali wild ass at [[Zoo Basel]]]]
Though the species itself is under no threat of extinction, due to abundant domestic stock ([[donkey]] and [[burro]]s), the two extant wild subspecies are both listed as critically endangered. African wild asses have been captured for domestication for centuries, and this, along with interbreeding between wild and domestic animals, has caused a distinct decline in population numbers. There are now only a few hundred individuals left in the wild.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; These animals are also hunted for food and for traditional medicine in both Ethiopia and Somalia.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; Competition with domestic livestock for grazing, and restricted access to water supplies caused by agricultural developments, pose further threats to the survival of this species.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; The African wild ass is legally protected in the countries where it is currently found, although these measures often prove difficult to enforce. A protected population of the Somali wild ass exists in the [[Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve]] in Israel, to the north of [[Eilat]]. This reserve was established in 1968 with the view to bolster populations of endangered desert species. Populations of horses and asses are fairly resilient and, if the species is properly protected, it may well recover from its current low.

==In captivity==
There are about 150 individual Somali wild asses living in zoos around the globe, of which 36 were born at [[Zoo Basel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zoobasel.ch/tiere/tierbeschreibungen.php?TiereID=122&amp;ZooeinteilungID=3&amp;PHPSESSID=690b0907fe640f2e37606d7f0934071a |title=Zoo Basel |publisher=Zoobasel.ch |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220225937/http://zoobasel.ch/tiere/tierbeschreibungen.php?TiereID=122&amp;ZooeinteilungID=3&amp;PHPSESSID=690b0907fe640f2e37606d7f0934071a |archivedate=20 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where this species's [[Breeding programs at Zoo Basel|breeding program]] started with Basel's first Somali wild asses in 1970 and the first birth in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoobasel.ch/aktuell/detail.php?NEWSID=140&amp;PHPSESSID=8be9b081e26b26503b123f9ea7cd8ff4 |title=Zoo Basel |publisher=Zoobasel.ch |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220230957/http://www.zoobasel.ch/aktuell/detail.php?NEWSID=140&amp;PHPSESSID=8be9b081e26b26503b123f9ea7cd8ff4 |archivedate=20 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoo Basel manages the European studbook for the Somali wild ass and coordinates the [[European Endangered Species Programme]] (EEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zooborns.com/zooborns/2014/04/somali-wild-ass-zoo-basel.html|title=Zoo Basel Welcomes a Critically Endangered Somali Wild Ass|work=ZooBorns}}&lt;/ref&gt; All European and American wild donkeys are either descendants of the original group at Zoo Basel or of 12 others that came from the [[Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve]] in Israel in 1972.

==Biography==
[[File:Regions of the Lands of Islam by al-Muqaddasi.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The regions of Islam in the tenth century, based on Al-Maqdisi's work]]
Al-Maqdisi, "the Jerusalemite" was born in [[Jerusalem]] in 946 AD. He had the advantage of an excellent education and after having made the Pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in his twentieth year, determined to devote himself to the study of geography. For the purpose of acquiring the necessary information he undertook a series of journeys which lasted over a score of years, and carried him in turn through all the countries of Islam. It was only in 985 that he set himself to write his book, which gives us a systematic account of all the places and regions he had visited.  Le Strange comments of Al-Maqdisi's work: "His description of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and especially of Jerusalem, his native city, is one of the best parts of the work. All that he wrote is the fruit of his own observation, and his descriptions of the manners and customs of the various countries, bear the stamp of a shrewd and observant mind, fortified by profound  knowledge of both books and men." (From: Guy le Strange, 1890: ''Palestine Under The Muslims'' [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/n32/mode/1up p.5] - [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/n33/mode/1up p.6])

The '''Baumé scale''' is a pair of [[hydrometer]] scales developed by French pharmacist [[Antoine Baumé]] in 1768 to measure [[density]] of various liquids. The unit of the Baumé scale has been notated variously as ''degrees Baumé'', ''B°'', ''Bé°'' and simply Baumé (the accent is not always present). One scale measures the density of liquids heavier than water and the other, liquids lighter than water. The Baumé of [[distilled water]] is 0. The [[API gravity]] scale is based on errors in early implementations of the Baumé scale.

==Conversions==
The relationship between specific gravity (s.g.) ([[relative density]]) and degrees Baumé is function of the temperature. Different versions of the scale may use different reference temperatures. Different conversions formulae can therefore be found in various handbooks.

As an example, a recent handbook&lt;ref&gt;'Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook (8th Edition)', McGraw-Hill, 2008. Table 1-13 (page 1-19). {{ISBN|978-0-07-142294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; states the conversions between specific gravity and degrees Baumé at a temperature of {{convert|60|F}}:
:*For liquids more dense than water, given the degrees Baumé, the specific gravity is: &lt;math&gt;\text{s.g.}=\frac{145}{145 - \mathrm{degrees\ Baum\acute{e}}}&lt;/math&gt;
:*For liquids more dense than water, given the specific gravity, the degrees Baumé is: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{degrees\ Baum\acute{e}}=145(1-\frac{1}{\text{s.g.}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:*For liquids less dense than water:  &lt;math&gt;\text{s.g.}=\frac{140}{130+\mathrm{degrees\ Baum\acute{e}}}&lt;/math&gt;

An older handbook&lt;ref&gt;Smithells, Colin J. and Al. 'Metals Reference Book', London Butterworths Scientific Publications, 1949. Page 41&lt;/ref&gt; gives the following formulae (no reference temperature being mentioned): 
:*For liquids more dense than water:&lt;math&gt;\text{s.g.}=\frac{144}{144 - \mathrm{degrees\ Baum\acute{e}}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:*For liquids less dense than water:&lt;math&gt;\text{s.g.}=\frac{144}{134 + \mathrm{degrees\ Baum\acute{e}}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Definitions==
Baumé degrees (heavy) originally represented the percent by mass of sodium chloride in water at {{convert|60|F}}.  Baumé degrees (light) was calibrated with 0°Bé (light) being the density of 10% NaCl in water by mass and 10°Bé (light) set to the density of water.

==Other scales==
Because of vague instructions or errors in translation a large margin of error was introduced when the scale was adopted.  The [[API gravity]] scale is a result of adapting to the subsequent errors from the Baumé scale.  The Baumé scale is related to the Balling, [[Brix]], [[Plato scale|Plato]] and '[[Gravity (beer)|specific gravity]] times 1000' scales.

Before standardisation on [[specific gravity]] around the time of [[World War II]] the Baumé scale was generally used in industrial chemistry and [[pharmacology]] for the measurement of density of liquids. Today the Baumé scale is still used in various industries such as brewing, [[sugar beet#Processing|sugar beet processing]], ophthalmics, [[starch]] industry, winemaking and printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication. It is also used for caustic in refining process.

'''Carlo Roberto Dati''' (1619–1676) was a Florentine nobleman, a disciple of [[Galileo]] (1564-1642) and, in his youth, an acquaintance of [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (1608-1647).

He befriended [[Lorenzo Magalotti]] (1637-1712) and [[Francesco Redi]] (1626-1697). Redi dedicated his ''Esperienze intorno alla generazione degl'insetti'' [Experiments on the generation of insects] ([[Florence]], 1668) to Dati. A founder of the [[Accademia del Cimento]], Dati participated assiduously in its meetings. As Secretary of the [[Accademia della Crusca]], he initiated the third edition of the ''Vocabolario'' (1691) and wrote the ''Discorso dell'obbligo di ben parlare la propria lingua'' (1657), in which he staunchly claimed the supremacy of [[Florentine Italian]].

He authored many scientific works, including the ''Lettera ai Filaleti della vera storia della cicloide e della famosissima esperienza dell'argento vivo'' [Letter to the Filaleti regarding the true story of the cycloid and the well-known sterling silver experience] (Florence, 1663), written under the pseudonym of Timauro Antiate. In it, he claimed the Tuscan - and thus Medicean - priority in the correct interpretation of Torricelli's 1644 experiment, which had sparked a lively discussion all over Europe. He also published many historical, political, and literary works, including the fascinating ''Vite de' pittori antichi'' [Lives of the old painters] (1667), dedicated to [[Louis XIV]] (1638-1715).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7654">'''Circular cumulative causation''' is a theory developed by Swedish economist [[Gunnar Myrdal]] in the year 1956. It is a multi-causal approach where the core variables and their linkages are delineated. The idea behind it is that a change in one form of an institution will lead to successive changes in other institutions. These changes are circular in that they continue in a cycle, many times in a negative way, in which there is no end, and cumulative in that they persist in each round. The change does not occur all at once as that would lead to chaos, rather the changes occur gradually.

Gunnar Myrdal developed the concept from [[Knut Wicksell]] and developed it with [[Nicholas Kaldor]] when they worked together at the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]]. Myrdal concentrated on the social provisioning aspect of development, while Kaldor concentrated on demand-supply relationships  to the manufacturing sector.

== Dynamics ==
In the characteristics that are relevant to the development process of an economy Myrdal mentioned the availability of natural resources, the historical traditions of production activity, national cohesion, religions and ideologies, economic, social and political leadership. Myrdal stated that the immediate effect of closing down certain lines of production in a community is the reduction of employment, income and demand. Through the analysis of the multiplier he pointed out that other sectors of the economy are also affected.

Then he argued that the contraction of the markets in that area tends to have a depressing effect on new investments, which in turn causes a further reduction of income and demand and, if nothing happens to modify the trend, there is a net movement of enterprises and workers towards other areas. Among the further results of these events, fewer local taxes are collected in a time when more social services is required and a vicious downward cumulative cycle is started and a trend towards a lower level of development will be further reinforced.

A status of non-equilibrium is shaped, or as he writes:
  
{{Quotation| "The notion of stable equilibrium is normally a false analogy to choose when constructing a theory to explain the changes in a social system. What is wrong with the stable equilibrium assumption as applied to social reality is the very idea that a social process follows a direction – though it might move towards it in a circuitous way – towards a position which in some sense or other can be described   as a state of equilibrium between forces. Behind this idea is another and still more basic assumption, namely that a change will regularly call forth a reaction in the system in the form of changes which on the whole go in the opposite direction to the first change. The idea I want to expound in this book is that, on the contrary, in the normal case there is no such a tendency towards automatic self-stabilisation in the social system. The system is by itself not moving towards any sort of balance between forces, but is constantly on the move away from such a situation. In the normal case a change does not call forth countervailing changes but, instead, supporting changes, which move the system in the same direction as the first change but much further. Because of such circular causation as a social process tends to become cumulative and often gather speed at an accelerating rate" 
(Myrdal, G.,1957,pp. 12–13 Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions, London:University Paperbacks, Methuen)}}

About Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions Myrdal 
wrote that ‘the argument moves on a general and methodological plane in the sense that the theory is discussed as a complex of broad structures of thought’ (His aim was to submit ‘broad generalisations, as a ‘theory’ is permitted to be, (in order to) grasp the social 
facts as they organize themselves into a pattern when viewed under a bird’s-eye perspective Into this general vision, the specific 
characteristic. source:(Myrdal, G. 1957,  Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions, London: University Paperbacks, Methuen))

Myrdal developed further the circular cumulative causation concept and stated that it makes different assumptions from that of stable equilibrium on what can be considered the most important forces guiding the evolution of social processes.
These forces characterise the dynamics of these processes in two diverse ways.

Yet, the provision of data or other information regarding single economies was beyond the scope of his work. He claimed that in the normal case there is no such a tendency towards automatic self-stabilisation in the social system. The system is by itself not moving towards any sort of balance between forces, but is constantly on the move away from such a situation
Myrdal used the expressions ‘approach’, ‘theory’ and ‘general 
theory’ as synonyms. In his subsequent writings, however, he mainly 
referred to ‘approach’, defining it as something containing, among other things, theories. He wrote that by this term he meant a collection of devices, like ‘the concepts, models, and theories we use, and the way in which we select and arrange observations and present the results of our research’.

In the preface to his Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions Myrdal 
wrote that {{Quotation| ‘the argument moves on a general and methodological plane in the sense that the theory is discussed as a complex of broad structures of thought’ (Myrdal, G. (1957), Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions, London: University Paperbacks, Methuen
 vii).)}}  
Myrdal called for economists 
to proceed by confronting the ‘facts of life’ with theories. The relation between theory and facts 
is, however, not simple. 
{{Quotation| Theory … must always be a priori to the observations of facts. Indeed, facts as part of scientific knowledge have no existence outside such a frame. … If theory is thus a priori, it is, on the other hand, a first principle of science that facts are sovereign. Theory is, in other words,  never more than a hypothesis. When the observations of facts do not agree with a theory, i.e. when they do not make sense in the frame of the theory utilised in carrying out the research, the theory has to be discarded and replaced by another one which promises a better fit (Myrdal, G. (1957), Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions, London: University Paperbacks, Methuen
p. 160). }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1823">A '''cliquet option''' or '''ratchet option''' is an [[exotic option]] consisting of a series of consecutive [[forward start option]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-derivatives.com/index.php/pricing-models-topmenu-37/24?task=view|title=global-derivatives.com|author=|date=|website=www.Global-Derivatives.com|access-date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is active immediately. The second becomes active when the first expires, etc. Each [[Option (finance)|option]] is struck [[at-the-money]] when it becomes active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riskglossary.com/link/forward_start_option.htm|title=Riskglossary.com|author=|date=|website=RiskGlossary.com|access-date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cliquet is, therefore, a series of at-the-money options but where the total premium is determined in advance. A cliquet can be thought of as a series of "pre-purchased" at-the-money options. The payout on each option can either be paid at the final [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]], or at the end of each reset period.&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.fincad.com/support/developerFunc/mathref/cliquet.htm FiNCAD - Cliquet options]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
* A three-year cliquet with reset dates each year would have three payoffs.  The first would pay off at the end of the first year and has the same payoff as a normal ATM option.  
* The second year's payoff has the same payoff as a two-year option, but with the [[strike price]] equal to the stock price at the end of the first year.   
* The third year's payoff has the same payoff as a three-year option, but with the strike price equal to the stock price at the end of the second year.

The '''copper coulometer''' is a one application for the [[copper-copper(II) sulfate electrode]].&lt;ref name="Glasstone2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Glasstone|title=An Introduction to Electrochemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzB8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29|date=16 April 2013|publisher=Read Books Limited|isbn=978-1-4465-4546-1|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JamesDavies1976"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.M.

Passing of [[current (electricity)|current]] through the element leads to the anodic [[solvation|dissolution]] of the metal on [[anode]] and simultaneous [[deposition (chemistry)|deposition]] of [[copper]] ions on the [[cathode]]. These reactions have 100% efficiency over a wide range of current density.

==Calculation==
The amount of [[electric charge]] (quantity of electricity) passed through the cell can easily be determined by measuring the change in mass of either electrode and calculating:
:&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{z_{Cu}\Delta m F}{M_{Cu}}&lt;/math&gt;,
where:
*&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the quantity of electricity (coulombs)
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass transported (gm)
*&lt;math&gt;z_{Cu}&lt;/math&gt; is the charge of the copper ions, equal to +2
*&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Faraday constant]] (96485.3383 coulombs per mole)
*&lt;math&gt;M_{Cu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[atomic weight]] of copper, equal to 63.546 grams per mole.

Although this apparatus is interesting from a theoretical and historical point of view, present-day electronic measurement of time and electric current provide in their multiplication the amount of passed [[coulomb]]s much easier, with greater precision, and in a shorter period of time than is possible by weighing the electrodes.

'''Fram''' is an [[impact crater]] located within the [[Meridiani Planum]] extraterrestrial plain, situated within the [[Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle]] (MC-19) region of the planet [[Mars]]. It was visited by the rover ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'' (MER-B) on Sol 84, April 24, 2004. 

Fram spans about 8 metres (26 feet) in diameter. ''Opportunity'' paused beside it while travelling from the rover's [[Eagle crater|landing site]] toward a larger crater, [[Endurance (crater)|Endurance]]. Fram is located about 450 metres (0.3 miles) east of the crater Eagle and around 250 metres (820 feet) west of Endurance.

It is named after the famous Norwegian polar exploration vessel the ''[[Fram]]'', a ship used by many famous Norwegian explorers such as [[Fridtjof Nansen]], [[Otto Sverdrup]], [[Oscar Wisting]], and [[Roald Amundsen]] &lt;ref name="Fram name NASA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/spirit/a24_20040602.html |title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Spotlight |website=[[NASA]] |access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''fuzzy control system''' is a [[control system]] based on [[fuzzy logic]]—a [[mathematics|mathematical]] system that analyzes [[analog signal|analog]] input values in terms of  [[mathematical logic|logic]]al variables that take on continuous values between 0 and 1, in contrast to classical or [[Digital data|digital]] logic, which operates on discrete values of either 1 or 0 (true or false, respectively).&lt;ref name = "Pedrycz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pedrycz|first1=Witold|title=Fuzzy control and fuzzy systems|year=1993|publisher=Research Studies Press Ltd.|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hájek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hájek|first1=Petr|title=Metamathematics of fuzzy logic|year=1998|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Fuzzy logic is widely used in machine control. The term  "fuzzy" refers to the fact that the logic involved can deal with concepts that cannot be expressed as the "true" or "false" but rather as "partially true".  Although alternative approaches such as genetic algorithms and neural networks can perform just as well as fuzzy logic in many cases, fuzzy logic has the advantage that the solution to the problem can be cast in terms that human operators can understand, so that their experience can be used in the design of the controller.  This makes it easier to mechanize tasks that are already successfully performed by humans.&lt;ref name = "Pedrycz" /&gt;

== History and applications ==
Fuzzy logic was first proposed by [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] of the University of California at Berkeley in a 1965 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90241-X| title = Fuzzy sets| journal = Information and Control| volume = 8| issue = 3| pages = 338–353| year = 1965| last1 = Zadeh | first1 = Lotfi A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated on his ideas in a 1973 paper that introduced the concept of "linguistic variables", which in this article equates to a variable defined as a fuzzy set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/TSMC.1973.5408575| title = Outline of a new approach to the analysis of complex systems and decision processes| journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics| volume = 1| pages = 28–44| year = 1973| last1 = Zadeh | first1 = Lotfi A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research followed, with the first industrial application, a cement [[kiln]] built in Denmark, coming on line in 1975.

Fuzzy systems were initially implemented in [[Japan]].

* Interest in fuzzy systems was sparked by Seiji Yasunobu and Soji Miyamoto of [[Hitachi]], who in 1985 provided simulations that demonstrated the feasibility of fuzzy control systems for the [[Sendai Subway]]. Their ideas were adopted, and fuzzy systems were used to control accelerating, braking, and stopping when the [[Sendai Subway Namboku Line|Namboku Line]] opened in 1987.
* In 1987, Takeshi Yamakawa demonstrated the use of fuzzy control, through a set of simple dedicated fuzzy logic chips, in an "[[inverted pendulum]]" experiment. This is a classic control problem, in which a vehicle tries to keep a pole mounted on its top by a hinge upright by moving back and forth. Yamakawa subsequently made the demonstration more sophisticated by mounting a wine glass containing water and even a live mouse to the top of the pendulum: the system maintained stability in both cases. Yamakawa eventually went on to organize his own fuzzy-systems research lab to help exploit his patents in the field.
* Japanese engineers subsequently developed a wide range of fuzzy systems for both industrial and consumer applications. In 1988 Japan established the Laboratory for International Fuzzy Engineering (LIFE), a cooperative arrangement between 48 companies to pursue fuzzy research. The automotive company Volkswagen was the only foreign corporate member of LIFE, dispatching a researcher for a duration of three years.
* Japanese consumer goods often incorporate fuzzy systems. Matsushita vacuum cleaners use microcontrollers running fuzzy algorithms to interrogate dust sensors and adjust [[suction power]] accordingly. Hitachi washing machines use fuzzy controllers to load-weight, fabric-mix, and dirt sensors and automatically set the wash cycle for the best use of power, water, and detergent.
* Canon developed an [[autofocus]]ing camera that uses a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) to measure the clarity of the image in six regions of its field of view and use the information provided to determine if the image is in focus. It also tracks the rate of change of lens movement during focusing, and controls its speed to prevent overshoot. The camera's fuzzy control system uses 12 inputs: 6 to obtain the current clarity data provided by the CCD and 6 to measure the rate of change of lens movement. The output is the position of the lens. The fuzzy control system uses 13 rules and requires 1.1 kilobytes of memory.
*An industrial [[air conditioner]] designed by Mitsubishi uses 25 heating rules and 25 cooling rules. A temperature sensor provides input, with control outputs fed to an [[inverter (logic gate)|inverter]], a compressor valve, and a fan motor. Compared to the previous design, the fuzzy controller heats and cools five times faster, reduces power consumption by 24%, increases temperature stability by a factor of two, and uses fewer sensors.
* Other applications investigated or implemented include: character and handwriting recognition; optical fuzzy systems; robots, including one for making Japanese flower arrangements; [[voice control|voice-controlled]] robot helicopters (hovering is a "balancing act" rather similar to the inverted pendulum problem); rehabilitation robotics to provide patient-specific solutions (e.g. to control heart rate and blood pressure &lt;ref name = "sarabadani"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TBME.2015.2391234 |title=Real-time closed-loop control of human heart rate and blood pressure|year=2015 |last1=Sarabadani Tafreshi |first1=Amirehsan |journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering|volume=62 |issue=5 |pages=1434–1442 |pmid=25594957 |last2=Klamroth-Marganska|first2=V. |last3=Nussbaumer |first3=S.|last4=Riener|first4=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;); control of flow of powders in film manufacture; elevator systems; and so on.

Work on fuzzy systems is also proceeding in the United State and Europe, although on a less extensive scale than in Japan.

* The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] has investigated fuzzy control for [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] motors, and [[NASA]] has studied fuzzy control for automated space docking: simulations show that a fuzzy control system can greatly reduce fuel consumption.
* Firms such as [[Boeing]], [[General Motors]], [[Allen-Bradley]], [[Chrysler]], [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]], and [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] have worked on fuzzy logic for use in low-power refrigerators, improved automotive transmissions, and energy-efficient electric motors.
* In 1995 [[Maytag]] introduced an "intelligent" [[dishwasher]] based on a fuzzy controller and a "one-stop sensing module" that combines a [[thermistor]], for temperature measurement; a conductivity sensor, to measure detergent level from the ions present in the wash; a turbidity sensor that measures scattered and transmitted light to measure the soiling of the wash; and a magnetostrictive sensor to read spin rate. The system determines the optimum wash cycle for any load to obtain the best results with the least amount of energy, detergent, and water. It even adjusts for dried-on foods by tracking the last time the door was opened, and estimates the number of dishes by the number of times the door was opened.

Research and development is also continuing on fuzzy applications in software, as opposed to [[firmware]], design, including fuzzy [[expert system]]s and integration of fuzzy logic with [[artificial neural network|neural-network]] and so-called adaptive "[[genetic algorithm|genetic]]" software systems, with the ultimate goal of building "self-learning" fuzzy-control systems.&lt;ref name="mamdani"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mamdani|first1=Ebrahim H|title=Application of fuzzy algorithms for control of simple dynamic plant|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Electrical Engineers|year=1974|volume=121|issue=12|pages=1585–1588|doi=10.1049/piee.1974.0328}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems can be employed to control complex, nonlinear dynamic plants, for example, human body.&lt;ref name = "sarabadani" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "mamdani" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bastian|first1=Andreas|title=Identifying fuzzy models utilizing genetic programming|journal=Fuzzy sets and systems|year=2000|volume=113|issue=3|pages=333–350|doi=10.1016/S0165-0114(98)00086-4|url=http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/pdf/specific/articulo/science2_27.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuzzy sets ==
{{see also|fuzzy set}}
{{unbalanced|section|date=April 2011}}
The input variables in a fuzzy control system are in general mapped by sets of membership functions similar to this, known as "fuzzy sets". The process of converting a crisp input value to a fuzzy value is called "fuzzification".

A control system may also have various types of [[switch]], or "ON-OFF", inputs along with its analog inputs, and such switch inputs of course will always have a truth value equal to either 1 or 0, but the scheme can deal with them as simplified fuzzy functions that happen to be either one value or another.

Given "[[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]s" of input variables into membership functions and [[truth value]]s, the [[microcontroller]] then [[decision making|makes decisions]] for what action to take, based on a set of "rules", each of the form:

   IF brake temperature IS warm AND speed IS not very fast 
   THEN brake pressure IS slightly decreased.

In this example, the two input variables are "brake temperature" and "speed" that have values defined as fuzzy sets. The output variable, "brake pressure" is also defined by a fuzzy set that can have values like "static" or "slightly increased" or "slightly decreased" etc.

This rule by itself is very puzzling since it looks like it could be used without bothering with fuzzy logic, but remember that the decision is based on a set of rules:

* All the rules that apply are invoked, using the membership functions and truth values obtained from the inputs, to determine the result of the rule.
* This result in turn will be mapped into a membership function and truth value controlling the output variable.
* These results are combined to give a specific ("crisp") answer, the actual brake pressure, a procedure known as "[[defuzzification]]".

This combination of fuzzy operations and [[Rule-based system|rule-based]] "[[inference]]" describes a "fuzzy expert system".

Traditional control systems are based on mathematical models in which the control system is described using one or more [[differential equation]]s that define the system response to its inputs. Such systems are often implemented as "PID controllers" ([[PID controller|proportional-integral-derivative controllers]]). They are the products of decades of development and theoretical analysis, and are highly effective.

If PID and other traditional control systems are so well-developed, why bother with fuzzy control? It has some advantages. In many cases, the mathematical model of the control process may not exist, or may be too "expensive" in terms of computer processing power and memory, and a system based on empirical rules may be more effective.

Furthermore, fuzzy logic is well suited to low-cost implementations based on cheap sensors, low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, and 4-bit or 8-bit one-chip microcontroller chips. Such systems can be easily upgraded by adding new rules to improve performance or add new features. In many cases, fuzzy control can be used to improve existing traditional controller systems by adding an extra layer of intelligence to the current control method.

=== Fuzzy control in detail ===
Fuzzy controllers are very simple conceptually. They consist of an input stage, a processing stage, and an output stage. The input stage maps sensor or other inputs, such as switches, thumbwheels, and so on, to the appropriate membership functions and truth values. The processing stage invokes each appropriate rule and generates a result for each, then combines the results of the rules. Finally, the output stage converts the combined result back into a specific control output value.

The most common shape of membership functions is triangular, although trapezoidal and bell curves are also used, but the shape is generally less important than the number of curves and their placement. From three to seven curves are generally appropriate to cover the required range of an input value, or the "[[universe of discourse]]" in fuzzy jargon.

As discussed earlier, the processing stage is based on a collection of logic rules in the form of IF-THEN statements, where the IF part is called the "antecedent" and the THEN part is called the "consequent". Typical fuzzy control systems have dozens of rules.

Consider a rule for a thermostat:

   IF (temperature is "cold") THEN turn (heater is "high")

This rule uses the truth value of the "temperature" input, which is some truth value of "cold", to generate a result in the fuzzy set for the "heater" output, which is some value of "high". This result is used with the results of other rules to finally generate the crisp composite output. Obviously, the greater the truth value of "cold", the higher the truth value of "high", though this does not necessarily mean that the output itself will be set to "high" since this is only one rule among many. 
In some cases, the membership functions can be modified by "hedges" that are equivalent to adverbs. Common hedges include "about", "near", "close to", "approximately", "very", "slightly", "too", "extremely", and "somewhat". These operations may have precise definitions, though the definitions can vary considerably between different implementations. "Very", for one example, squares membership functions; since the membership values are always less than 1, this narrows the membership function. "Extremely" cubes the values to give greater narrowing, while "somewhat" broadens the function by taking the square root.

In practice, the fuzzy rule sets usually have several antecedents that are combined using fuzzy operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT, though again the definitions tend to vary: AND, in one popular definition, simply uses the minimum weight of all the antecedents, while OR uses the maximum value. There is also a NOT operator that subtracts a membership function from 1 to give the "complementary" function.

There are several ways to define the result of a rule, but one of the most common and simplest is the "max-min" [[inference]] method, in which the output membership function is given the truth value generated by the premise.

Rules can be solved in parallel in hardware, or sequentially in software. The results of all the rules that have fired are "defuzzified" to a crisp value by one of several methods. There are dozens, in theory, each with various advantages or drawbacks.

The "centroid" method is very popular, in which the "center of mass" of the result provides the crisp value. Another approach is the "height" method, which takes the value of the biggest contributor. The centroid method favors the rule with the output of greatest area, while the height method obviously favors the rule with the greatest output value.

The diagram below demonstrates max-min inferencing and centroid defuzzification for a system with input variables "x", "y", and "z" and an output variable "n". Note that "mu" is standard fuzzy-logic nomenclature for "truth value":

[[File:Fuzzy control - centroid defuzzification using max-min inferencing.png]]

Notice how each rule provides a result as a truth value of a particular membership function for the output variable. In centroid defuzzification the values are OR'd, that is, the maximum value is used and values are not added, and the results are then combined using a centroid calculation.

Fuzzy control system design is based on empirical methods, basically a methodical approach to [[trial-and-error]]. The general process is as follows:

* Document the system's operational specifications and inputs and outputs.
* Document the fuzzy sets for the inputs.
* Document the rule set.
* Determine the defuzzification method.
* Run through test suite to validate system, adjust details as required.
* Complete document and release to production.

As a general example, consider the design of a fuzzy controller for a steam turbine. The block diagram of this control system appears as follows:

&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[File:fuzzy control block.png]] --&gt;

The input and output variables map into the following fuzzy set:

[[File:Fuzzy control - input and output variables mapped into a fuzzy set.png]]—where:

   N3:   Large negative.
   N2:   Medium negative.
   N1:   Small negative.
   Z:    Zero.
   P1:   Small positive.
   P2:   Medium positive.
   P3:   Large positive.

The rule set includes such rules as:

 rule 1:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS weak,   
          THEN throttle is P3.

 rule 2:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS low,    
          THEN throttle is P2.

 rule 3:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS ok,     
          THEN throttle is Z.

 rule 4:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS strong, 
          THEN throttle is N2.

In practice, the controller accepts the inputs and maps them into their membership functions and truth values. These mappings are then fed into the rules. If the rule specifies an AND relationship between the mappings of the two input variables, as the examples above do, the minimum of the two is used as the combined truth value; if an OR is specified, the maximum is used. The appropriate output state is selected and assigned a membership value at the truth level of the premise. The truth values are then defuzzified. 
For an example, assume the temperature is in the "cool" state, and the pressure is in the "low" and "ok" states. The pressure values ensure that only rules 2 and 3 fire:

[[File:Fuzzy control - Rule 2 evaluation.png]]

[[File:Fuzzy control - Rule 3 evaluation.png]]

The two outputs are then defuzzified through centroid defuzzification:

The output value will adjust the throttle and then the control cycle will begin again to generate the next value .

=== Building a fuzzy controller ===
Consider implementing with a microcontroller chip a simple feedback controller:

[[File:Fuzzy control system-feedback controller.png]]

A fuzzy set is defined for the input error variable "e", and the derived change in error, "delta", as well as the "output", as follows:

   LP:  large positive
   SP:  small positive
   ZE:  zero
   SN:  small negative
   LN:  large negative

If the error ranges from -1 to +1, with the analog-to-digital converter used having a resolution of 0.25, then the input variable's fuzzy set (which, in this case, also applies to the output variable) can be described very simply as a table, with the error / delta / output values in the top row and the truth values for each membership function arranged in rows beneath:

   _______________________________________________________________________
 
               -1    -0.75  -0.5   -0.25    0     0.25   0.5    0.75    1

    mu(SP)      0      0      0      0     0.3    0.7     1     0.7    0.3

   _______________________________________________________________________            —or, in graphical form (where each "X" has a value of 0.1):

       +------------------------------------------------------------------+

Suppose this fuzzy system has the following rule base:

   rule 1:  IF e = ZE AND delta = ZE THEN output = ZE
   rule 2:  IF e = ZE AND delta = SP THEN output = SN
   rule 3:  IF e = SN AND delta = SN THEN output = LP
   rule 4:  IF e = LP OR  delta = LP THEN output = LN

These rules are typical for control applications in that the antecedents consist of the logical combination of the error and error-delta signals, while the consequent is a control command output. 
The rule outputs can be defuzzified using a discrete centroid computation:

   SUM( I = 1 TO 4 OF ( mu(I) * output(I) ) ) / SUM( I = 1 TO 4 OF mu(I) )

Now, suppose that at a given time we have: 
   e     = 0.25
   delta = 0.5

Then this gives:

   ________________________
 
               e     delta
   ________________________
 
   mu(LP)      0      0.3
   mu(SP)     0.7      1
   mu(ZE)     0.7     0.3
   mu(SN)      0       0
   mu(LN)      0       0
   ________________________

Plugging this into rule 1 gives:

   rule 1:  IF e = ZE AND delta = ZE THEN output = ZE
  
      mu(1)     = MIN( 0.7, 0.3 ) = 0.3
      output(1) = 0

-- where:

* mu(1): Truth value of the result membership function for rule 1. In terms of a centroid calculation, this is the "mass" of this result for this discrete case.
* output(1):  Value (for rule 1) where the result membership function (ZE) is maximum over the output variable fuzzy set range. That is, in terms of a centroid calculation, the location of the "center of mass" for this individual result. This value is independent of the value of "mu". It simply identifies the location of ZE along the output range.

The other rules give:

   rule 2:  IF e = ZE AND delta = SP THEN output = SN
 
      mu(2)     = MIN( 0.7, 1 ) = 0.7   
      output(2) = -0.5

   rule 3: IF e = SN AND delta = SN THEN output = LP
 
      mu(3)     = MIN( 0.0, 0.0 ) = 0
      output(3) = 1

   rule 4: IF e = LP OR  delta = LP THEN output = LN
 
      mu(4)     = MAX( 0.0, 0.3 ) = 0.3
      output(4) = -1

The centroid computation yields:

   &lt;math&gt; \frac{mu(1) \cdot output(1)+mu(2) \cdot output(2)+mu(3) \cdot output(3)+mu(4) \cdot output(4)}{mu(1)+mu(2)+mu(3)+mu(4)} &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt;=\frac{(0.3 \cdot 0)+(0.7 \cdot-0.5)+(0 \cdot 1) +(0.3 \cdot-1)}{0.3+0.7+0+0.3} &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt;=-0.5&lt;/math&gt;—for the final control output. Simple. Of course the hard part is figuring out what rules actually work correctly in practice.

If you have problems figuring out the centroid equation, remember that a centroid is defined by summing all the moments (location times mass) around the center of gravity and equating the sum to zero. So if &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; is the center of gravity, &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; is the location of each mass, and &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; is each mass, this gives:

   &lt;math&gt;0 = ( X_1 - X_0 ) \cdot M_1 + ( X_2 - X_0 ) \cdot M_2 + \ldots + ( X_n - X_0 ) \cdot M_n&lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt;0 = ( X_1 \cdot M_1 + X_2 \cdot M_2 + \ldots + X_n \cdot M_n ) - X_0 \cdot ( M_1 + M_2 + \ldots + M_n ) &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt; X_0 \cdot ( M_1 + M_2 + \ldots + M_n ) =  X_1 \cdot M_1 + X_2 \cdot M_2 + \ldots + X_n \cdot M_n &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt; X_0 = \frac{ X_1 \cdot M_1 + X_2 \cdot M_2 + \ldots + X_n \cdot M_n }{ M_1 + M_2 + \ldots + M_n }&lt;/math&gt;

In our example, the values of mu correspond to the masses, and the values of X to location of the masses  
(mu, however, only 'corresponds to the masses' if the initial 'mass' of the output functions are all the same/equivalent. If they are not the same, i.e. some are narrow triangles, while others maybe wide trapizoids or shouldered triangles, then the mass or area of the output function must be known or calculated. It is this mass that is then scaled by mu and multiplied by its location X_i).

This system can be implemented on a standard microprocessor, but dedicated fuzzy chips are now available. For example, Adaptive Logic INC of San Jose, California, sells a "fuzzy chip", the AL220, that can accept four analog inputs and generate four analog outputs. A block diagram of the chip is shown below:

== Antilock brakes ==
As a first example, consider an [[anti-lock braking system]], directed by a microcontroller chip. The microcontroller has to make decisions based on brake [[temperature]], [[speed]], and other variables in the system.

The variable "temperature" in this system can be subdivided into a range of "states": "cold", "cool", "moderate", "warm", "hot", "very hot". The transition from one state to the next is hard to define.

An arbitrary static threshold might be set to divide "warm" from "hot". For example, at exactly 90 degrees, warm ends and hot begins. But this would result in a discontinuous change when the input value passed over that threshold. The transition wouldn't be smooth, as would be required in braking situations.

The way around this is to make the states ''fuzzy''. That is, allow them to change gradually from one state to the next. In order to do this there must be a dynamic relationship established between different factors.

We start by defining the input temperature states using "membership functions":

[[File:Fuzzy control - definition of input temperature states using membership functions.png]]

With this scheme, the input variable's state no longer jumps abruptly from one state to the next. Instead, as the temperature changes, it loses value in one membership function while gaining value in the next. In other words, its ranking in the category of cold decreases as it becomes more highly ranked in the warmer category.

At any sampled timeframe, the "truth value" of the brake temperature will almost always be in some degree part of two membership functions: i.e.: '0.6 nominal and 0.4 warm', or '0.7 nominal and 0.3 cool', and so on.

The above example demonstrates a simple application, using the [[abstraction]] of values from multiple values. This only represents one kind of data, however, in this case, temperature.

Adding additional sophistication to this braking system, could be done by additional factors such as [[Traction (engineering)|traction]], speed, [[inertia]], set up in dynamic functions, according to the designed fuzzy system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vichuzhanin|first=Vladimir|title=Realization of a fuzzy controller with fuzzy dynamic correction|journal=Central European Journal of Engineering|date=12 April 2012|volume=2|issue=3|pages=392–398|doi=10.2478/s13531-012-0003-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical interpretation of fuzzy control==
In spite of the appearance there are several difficulties to give a rigorous logical interpretation of the ''IF-THEN'' rules. As an example, interpret a rule as  ''IF (temperature is "cold") THEN (heater is "high")'' by the first order formula ''Cold(x)→High(y)'' and assume that r is an input such that ''Cold(r)'' is false. Then the formula ''Cold(r)→High(t)'' is true for any ''t'' and therefore any ''t'' gives a correct control given ''r''. A rigorous logical justification of fuzzy control is given in Hájek's book (see Chapter 7) where fuzzy control is represented as a theory of Hájek's basic logic.&lt;ref name = "Hájek" /&gt; Also in Gerla 2005 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerla|first1=Giangiacomo|title=Fuzzy logic programming and fuzzy control|journal=Studia Logica|date=2005|volume=79|issue=2|pages=231–254|doi=10.1007/s11225-005-2977-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; another logical approach to fuzzy control is proposed based on fuzzy logic programming.Indeed, denote by ''f'' the fuzzy function arising of an IF-THEN systems of rules. Then we can translate this system into a fuzzy program P containing a series of rules whose head is "Good(x,y)". The interpretation of this predicate in the least fuzzy [[Herbrand model]] of P coincides with f. This gives further useful tools to fuzzy control.

[[File:Goto telescope.jpg|thumb|right|A telescope on an [[altazimuth mount|alt-azimuth]] GoTo mount.  Note the keypad, resting on the platform between the tripod's legs, that is the telescope's hand control. Batteries are stored in the circular compartment just above the tripod. In this picture, the compartment is just above the hand control.]]

In [[amateur astronomy]], "'''GoTo'''" refers to a type of [[telescope mount]] and related [[software]] that can automatically point a [[optical telescope|telescope]] at [[astronomical object]]s that the user selects. Both axes of a GoTo mount are driven by a [[motor controller|motor]] and controlled by a computer. It may be either a [[microprocessor]]-based integrated controller or an external [[personal computer]]. This differs from the single-axis semi-automated tracking of a traditional [[clock drive|clock-drive]] [[equatorial mount]]. 

The user can command the mount to point the telescope to the [[celestial coordinate system|celestial coordinates]] that the user inputs, or to objects in a pre-programmed database including ones from the [[Messier catalogue]], the [[New General Catalogue]], and even major [[Solar System]] bodies (the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s).
  
Like a standard [[equatorial mount]], equatorial GoTo mounts can track the [[night sky]] by driving the [[right ascension]] axis. Since both axes are computer controlled, GoTo technology also allows telescope manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler [[altazimuth mount]]s.

==How a GoTo mount works==
GoTo mounts are ''pre-aligned'' before use. When it is powered on, it may ask for the user's latitude, longitude, time, and date. It can also get this data from a [[GPS]] receiver connected to the telescope or built into the telescope mount itself, and the mount controller can have its own real time clock.

===Alt-azimuth mounts===
Alt-azimuth GoTo mounts need to be aligned on a known "alignment star", which the user will centre in the eyepiece. From the inputted time and location and the star's [[altitude]] and [[azimuth]] the telescope mount will know its orientation to the entire sky and can then find any object.

For accuracy purposes, a second alignment star, as far away as possible from the first and if possible close to the object to be observed, may be used.  This is because the mount might not be level with the ground; this will cause the telescope to accurately point to objects close to the initial alignment star, but less accurately for an object on the other side of the sky.

An additional reason for using two alignment stars is that the time and location information entered by the user may not be accurate.  For example, a one-degree inaccuracy in the latitude or a 4-minute inaccuracy in the time may result in the telescope pointing a degree away from the user's target.

When the user selects an object from the mount's database, the object's altitude and azimuth will be computed from its [[right ascension]] and [[declination]].  Then, the mount will move the telescope to that altitude and azimuth and track the object so it remains in the field of view despite Earth's rotation.  Moving to the location is called ''slewing''.

[[Image:Goto_hand_control.JPG|thumb|right|The disconnected hand control of a GoTo telescope mount.  The large arrow buttons are used for slewing the telescope.  Below these, the number buttons are used for both inputting information and selecting which catalogue to choose objects from.]]

When [[astrophotography]] is involved, a further motor has to be used to rotate the camera to match the field of view for long exposure photographs.

===Equatorial mounts===
For an equatorial GoTo telescope mount, the user must align the mount by hand with either the north celestial pole or the south celestial pole. Assuming the user is accurate in the alignment, the mount points the telescope to a bright star, asking the user to center it in the eyepiece.  Since the star's correct right ascension and declination is already known, the distance from what the user considered to be the celestial pole and the actual pole can be roughly deduced.  Using another alignment star can further improve the accuracy of the alignment.

After alignment the telescope mount will then know its orientation with respect to the night sky, and can point to any right-ascension and declination coordinates.

When the user selects an object to view, the mount's [[software]] looks up the object's right ascension and declination and slews (moves) to those coordinates.  To track the object so that it stays in the eyepiece despite Earth's rotation, only the right-ascension axis is moved.

==History==
The International Lichenological Association arose out of the 10th [[International Botanical Congress]], held in [[Edinburgh]] in 1964, when a small group of lichenologists approved a motion to form an international association. The intention was to produce a newsletter to disseminate information quickly amongst lichenologists around the world, and a small committee comprising Rolf Santesson, Peter James and [[Vernon Ahmadjian]] was appointed to get it established.
The association's official inauguration took place at the 11th International Botanical Congress in [[Seattle]] in 1969 when the General Assembly of the [[International Union of Biological Sciences|IUBS]] officially recognised the new organisation.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

==Awards==
The IAL currently hands out four awards to recognise significant contributions made to lichenology.

The [[Acharius Medal]] is awarded to distinguished lichenologists in recognition of their lifetime achievements. Recipients have included [[David Leslie Hawksworth|David Hawksworth]] (2002), [[Nina Golubkova]] (2000), [[Vernon Ahmadjian]] (1996), [[Irwin M. Brodo|Irwin Brodo]] (1994), [[William Louis Culberson|William Culberson]] (1992), [[Aino Henssen]] (1992), [[Hildur Krog]] (1992) and [[Hans Trass]] (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acharius Medallists|url=http://www.lichenology.org/Awards/AchariusMedallists.html|publisher=International Association for Lichenology|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Mason Hale]] Award is granted in recognition of excellence in research by young lichenologists, such as doctoral dissertations.

The Margalith Galun Award is presented for outstanding student contributions to an IAL meeting.

[[File:Foreign and Indian participants at an event at the International Centre Goa.jpg|thumb|Foreign and Indian participants at an event at the International Centre Goa.]]On taking over as its Director, Raj Doctor argued that the Centre might have "deviated from its core objective of ideation....  What I do know, however, is that we have to bring back the International Centre Goa from dealing with softer issues, to more hard core ideation plans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patel|first1=Alisha|title=ICG Will Now Focus On Hard Core Ideation|url=http://businessgoa.in/2015/02/01/icg-will-now-focus-on-hard-core-ideation/|website=businessgoa.in|publisher=Business Goa|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Westley Newman''' (July 2, 1936 – March 6, 2015) was an [[People from the United States|American]] [[inventor]] and [[author]] who claimed to have developed an "[[Newman's energy machine|energy machine]]" deemed by the US Patent and Trademark Office to be a [[perpetual motion]] machine.  He described this device in a book, ''[[The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman]]''. Newman alleged that he had a mechanical explanation for [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[unified field theory]] of [[physics]]. After applying for [[patents]] on the [[perpetual motion]] motor, he battled for over seven years against what he claimed was a [[conspiracy theory|government conspiracy]] to suppress his supposed discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;Movie: Newman - https://vimeo.com/141669315&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, he gained national attention.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: [[Johnny Carson Show]] - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSgutzwP75c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Early life==
After Newman graduated from Baker High School in [[Mobile, Alabama]], he joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] in 1955 to serve as an [[expediter]], and was stationed at [[Ramey Air Force Base]] in [[Puerto Rico]] where he witnessed [[Hurricane Betsy (1956)|Hurricane Betsy]] devastate the island in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Video: [GMWW] 2.1 The Epic Sacrifice for Humanity-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va1DLaeKW2Y&lt;/ref&gt; The aftermath of the hurricane prompted Newman to make a pledge to God that he would devote the rest of his life to help humanity.&lt;ref name="Big Eureka"&gt;Video: Big Eureka: The Energy machine of Joseph Newman - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMYo1QlvK5g&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the Air Force a year early on the [[G.I. Bill]], Newman attended the [[University of Alabama]], enrolling in economics and accounting courses. He left college after acquiring interest in inventing and not long after, was awarded patents for the first plastic [[barbells]].&lt;ref name="Big Eureka"/&gt; After selling his barbell business, he had the capital "to buy science books"{{cite quote|date=August 2018}} and began to study energy, electrical engineering, [[physics]] and electromagnetics.

==Career controversies==
Joseph Newman applied for a patent on his "[[Newman's energy machine|energy machine]]" in 1979, which was rejected by the US Patent and Trademark Office as a [[perpetual motion machine]]. From 1979 to 1986 he filed lawsuits against the patent office to force the award of his [[patent]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview: New Energy Series : Joseph Newman 3/5 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMC5Ra2-8QA&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal District Court]] ordered the machine turned over to the [[National Bureau of Standards]] for testing.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Article: One Mans Tangle with the U.S. Patent Office - https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/21/us/one-man-s-tangle-with-the-patent-office.html&lt;/ref&gt; The NBS also admitted the order to test was unusual saying: "It's very unusual for us to be testing something for a patent." Matthew Heyman, a bureau spokesman, said, "I'm not aware of us ever having been involved in a patent case before."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Newman persuaded seven members of Congress to sponsor private bills on his behalf that would order the Patent Office to grant him a patent.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

The NBS concluded that Newman's machine did not reach or exceed 100% efficiency as Newman claimed, and declared the patent as unrewardable.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Later life==
In 1989 Newman claimed, while already married, to have married his secretary and her 8 year old daughter, acting on orders from God. The daughter was removed from his home by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/590/is-it-possible-to-build-a-machine-that-generates-more-power-than-it-uses/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=hcYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d2MEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4638,8530841&amp;dq=joseph+newman+lucedale&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 he announced a run for the American Presidency, claiming that God had instructed him to run in order that the extinction of humanity by 1999 might be averted, and that [[Nostradamus]] had predicted his existence.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=qmofAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G9UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2718,8859736&amp;dq=joseph+newman+lucedale&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary==
Jon Fox directed a 2015 documentary film about Newman, entitled "Newman". It provides background on Newman's childhood, his struggles to obtain a patent, and interviews with Newman in 2014, shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newmanmovie.com&lt;/ref&gt;

This article attempts to conveniently list articles on some of the most useful coordinate charts in some of the most useful examples of [[Riemannian manifold]]s.

The notion of a [[coordinate chart]] is fundamental to various notions of a ''manifold'' which are used in mathematics.
In order of increasing ''level of structure:''
*[[topological manifold]]
*[[smooth manifold]]
*[[Riemannian manifold]] and [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|semi-Riemannian manifold]]
For our purposes, the key feature of the last two examples is that we have defined a [[metric tensor]] which we can use to integrate along a curve, such as a [[geodesic]] curve.  The key difference between Riemannian metrics and semi-Riemannian metrics is that the former arise from [[fiber bundle|bundling]] [[definite bilinear form|positive-definite]] [[quadratic form]]s, whereas the latter arise from bundling [[Definite quadratic form|indefinite quadratic forms]].

A four-dimensional semi-Riemannian manifold is often called a [[Lorentzian manifold]], because these provide the mathematical setting for [[metric theory of gravitation|metric theories of gravitation]] such as [[general relativity]].

For many topics in [[applied mathematics]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[engineering]], it is important to be able to write the most important [[partial differential equations]] of mathematical physics
*[[heat equation]]
*[[Laplace equation]]
*[[wave equation]]
(as well as variants of this basic triad) in various coordinate systems which are ''adapted'' to any symmetries which may be present.  While this may be how many students first encounter a non-Cartesian coordinate chart, such as the cylindrical chart on '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (three-dimensional Euclidean space), it turns out that these charts are useful for many other purposes, such as writing down interesting vector fields, congruences of curves, or frame fields in a convenient way.

Listing commonly encountered coordinate charts unavoidably involves some real and apparent overlap, for at least two reasons:
*many charts exist in all (sufficiently large) dimensions, but perhaps only for certain families of manifolds such as spheres,
*many charts most commonly encountered for specific manifolds, such as spheres, actually can be used (with an appropriate metric tensor) for more general manifolds, such as spherically symmetric manifolds.
Therefore, seemingly any attempt to organize them into a list involves multiple overlaps, which we have accepted in this list in order to be able to offer a convenient if messy reference.

We emphasize that ''this list is far from exhaustive''.

==Favorite surfaces==

Here are some charts which (with appropriate metric tensors) can be used in the stated classes of Riemannian and semi-Riemannian surfaces:

*[[isothermal chart]]
*Radially symmetric surfaces:
**[[polar chart]]
*Surfaces embedded in '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;:
**[[Monge chart]]
*Certain [[minimal surface]]s:
**[[asymptotic chart]] (see also [[asymptotic line]])

Here are some charts on some of the most useful Riemannian surfaces (note that there is some overlap, since many charts of '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; have closely analogous charts on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; in such cases, both are discussed in the same article):

*Euclidean plane '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:
**[[Cartesian chart]]
**[[Maxwell chart]]
*Sphere '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:
**[[polar chart]] (arc length radial chart)
**[[stereographic chart]]
**[[central projection chart]]
**[[axial projection chart]]
**[[Mercator chart]]
*Hyperbolic plane '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:
**[[polar chart]]
**[[stereographic chart]] (Poincaré model)
**[[upper half space chart]] (another Poincaré model)
**[[central projection chart]] (Klein model)
**[[Mercator chart]]

Favorite semi-Riemannian surface:

*AdS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (or S&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;) and dS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (or H&lt;sup&gt;1,1)&lt;/sup&gt;:
**central projection
**equatorial trig
''Note:'' the difference between these two surfaces is in a sense merely a matter of convention, according to whether we consider either the cyclic or the non-cyclic coordinate to be timelike; in higher dimensions the distinction is less trivial.

==Favorite Riemannian three-manifolds==

Here are some charts which (with appropriate metric tensors) can be used in the stated classes of three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds:

*Diagonalizable manifolds:
**[[isothermal chart]]
(''Note:'' not every three manifold admits an isothermal chart.)

*Axially symmetric manifolds:
**[[cylindrical chart]]
**[[parabolic chart]]
**[[hyperbolic chart]]
**[[prolate spheroidal chart]] (rational and trigonometric forms)
**[[oblate spheroidal chart]] (rational and trigonometric forms)
**[[toroidal chart]]

Here are some charts which can be used on some of the most useful Riemannian three-manifolds:

*Three-dimensional Euclidean space E&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;:
**cartesian
**[[polar spherical chart]]
**[[cylindrical chart]]
**elliptical cylindrical, hyperbolic cylindrical, parabolic cylindrical charts
**[[parabolic chart]]
**[[hyperbolic chart]]
**[[prolate spheroidal chart]] (rational and trigonometric forms)
**[[oblate spheroidal chart]] (rational and trigonometric forms)
**[[toroidal chart]]
**[[Cassini toroidal chart]] and [[Cassini bipolar chart]]
*Three-sphere S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
**[[polar chart]]
**[[stereographic chart]]
**[[Hopf chart]]
*Hyperbolic three-space H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
**[[polar chart]]
**[[upper half space chart]] (Poincaré model)
**[[Hopf chart]]

==A few higher-dimensional examples==

*S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
**[[Hopf chart]]
*H&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
**[[upper half space chart]] (Poincaré model)
**[[Hopf chart]]

==Omitted examples==

There are of course many important and interesting examples of Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds which are not even mentioned here, including:
*[[Bianchi classification|Bianchi group]]s: there is a short list (up to [[local isometry]]) of three-dimensional real Lie groups, which when considered as Riemannian-three manifolds give homogeneous but (usually) non-isotropic geometries.
*other noteworthy real [[Lie group]]s,
*[[Lorentzian manifold]]s which (perhaps with some added structure such as a scalar field) serve as solutions to the field equations of various metric theories of gravitation, in particular [[general relativity]].  There is some overlap here; in particular:
*[[axisymmetric spacetime]]s such as [[Weyl vacuum]]s possess various charts discussed here; the prolate spheroidal chart turns out to be particularly useful,
*[[de Sitter model]]s in cosmology are, as manifolds, nothing other than H&lt;sup&gt;1,3&lt;/sup&gt; and as such possess numerous interesting and useful charts modeled after ones listed here.

In addition, one can certainly consider coordinate charts on complex manifolds, perhaps with metrics which arise from bundling Hermitian forms.  Indeed, this natural generalization is just the tip of iceberg. However, these generalizations are best dealt with in more specialized lists.

The '''Little Joe 1B''' was a [[Launch escape system|Launch Escape System]] test of the Mercury spacecraft, conducted as part of the U.S. [[Project Mercury|Mercury program]]. The mission also carried a female [[rhesus macaque|rhesus monkey]] (''Macaca mulatta'') named Miss Sam in the Mercury spacecraft. The mission was launched January 21, 1960, from Wallops Island, Virginia. The Little Joe 1B flew to an [[apsis|apogee]] of 9.3 statute miles (15.0&amp;nbsp;km) and a range of 11.7 miles (18.9&amp;nbsp;km) out to sea. Miss Sam survived the 8 minute 35 second flight in good condition. The spacecraft was recovered by a Marine helicopter and returned to Wallops Island within about 45 minutes. Miss Sam was one of many [[monkeys in space|monkeys used in space travel research]].

The '''magnitude condition''' is a constraint that is satisfied by the locus of points in the [[s-plane]] on which [[closed-loop poles]] of a system reside.  In combination with the [[angle condition]], these two mathematical expressions fully determine the [[root locus]].

Let the characteristic equation of a system be &lt;math&gt;1+\textbf{G}(s)=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)=\frac{\textbf{P}(s)}{\textbf{Q}(s)}&lt;/math&gt;.  Rewriting the equation in [[polar form]] is useful.

: &lt;math&gt;e^{j2\pi}+\textbf{G}(s)=0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)=-1=e^{j(\pi+2k\pi)}&lt;/math&gt;  where
&lt;math&gt;(k=0,1,2,...)&lt;/math&gt; are the only solutions to this equation.  Rewriting &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; in [[factored form]],

: &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)=\frac{\textbf{P}(s)}{\textbf{Q}(s)}=K\frac{(s-a_1)(s-a_2)\cdots(s-a_n)}{(s-b_1)(s-b_2)\cdots(s-b_m)},&lt;/math&gt;

and representing each factor &lt;math&gt;(s-a_p)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(s-b_q)&lt;/math&gt; by their [[vector (geometric)|vector]] equivalents, &lt;math&gt;A_pe^{j\theta_p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_qe^{j\phi_q}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; may be rewritten.

: &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)=K\frac{A_1 A_2 \cdots A_ne^{j(\theta_1+\theta_2+\cdots+\theta_n)}}{B_1 B_2 \cdots B_m e^{j(\phi_1+\phi_2+\cdots+\phi_m)}}&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying the characteristic equation,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
e^{j(\pi+2k\pi)} &amp; =K\frac{A_1 A_2 \cdots A_ne^{j(\theta_1+\theta_2+\cdots+\theta_n)}}{B_1 B_2 \cdots B_m e^{j(\phi_1+\phi_2+\cdots+\phi_m)}} \\
&amp; =K\frac{A_1 A_2 \cdots A_n}{B_1 B_2 \cdots B_m}e^{j(\theta_1+\theta_2+\cdots+\theta_n-(\phi_1+\phi_2+\cdots+\phi_m))},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

from which we derive the magnitude condition:

: &lt;math&gt;1=K\frac{A_1 A_2 \cdots A_n}{B_1 B_2 \cdots B_m}. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[angle condition]] is derived similarly.

{{Chalcolithic}}
[[File:ReconstructedOetziAxe.jpg|thumb| Reconstruction of [[Ötzi]]'s copper axe (c. 3300 BC)]]

The [[Copper Age]], also called the [[Eneolithic]] or the [[Chalcolithic]] Age, has been traditionally understood as a transitional period between the [[Neolithic]] and the [[Bronze Age]], in which a gradual introduction of the metal ([[native copper]]) took place, while stone was still the main resource utilized. Recent archaeology has found that the metal was not introduced so gradually and that this entailed significant social changes, such as developments in the type of habitation (larger villages, launching of fortifications), long-distance trade, and copper [[metallurgy]].

Roughly, the Copper Age could be situated chronologically between the 5th and 6th [[millennium|millennia]] BC in places like the archaeological sites of [[Majdanpek]], [[Јarmovac]] and [[Pločnik]] (a copper axe from 5500&amp;nbsp;BC belonging to the [[Vinča culture]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002605.html Neolithic Vinča was a metallurgical culture] Stonepages from news sources November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat later, in the 5th millennium BC, metalwork is attested at [[Rudna Glava]] mine in [[Serbia]],&lt;ref&gt;Tasić, 1995, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; and at Ai Bunar mine in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muzeuluniriialba.ro/docs/apulum/articole/40.%20sentmiklosi.pdf{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

3rd millennium BC copper metalwork is attested in places like [[Palmela]] (Portugal), [[Cortes de Navarra]] (Spain), and [[Stonehenge]] (United Kingdom). However, as often happens with the [[prehistoric]] times, the limits of the age cannot be clearly defined and vary with different sources.

==Inception of metallurgy in Europe==
The theory that [[metallurgy]] was imported into Europe from the Near East has been practically ruled out. A second hypothesis, that there were two main points of origin of metallurgy in Europe, in southern Spain and in West Bulgaria, is also doubtful due to the existence of sites outside the centers of diffusion where metallurgy was known simultaneously with, or before, those in the ‘original’ nuclei, such as [[Brixlegg]] (Tyrol, Austria), while sites closer to the supposed origins of metallurgy, such as in the north of Spain, show fewer metal artifacts than sites in the south and practically no evidence of production (Perez Arrondo 1986).

Currently, the general opinion is that the development of metallurgy took place independently in different places, at different times, with various techniques. One fact that supports this interpretation is that, although the final products (beads, rings, sickles, swords, axes, etc.) are quite similar throughout Europe, the method of production is not. Thus the use of [[Crucible#Chalcolithic|crucibles]] was the technique utilized in the south of Spain, whereas central Europe employed a [[Ancient iron production#Early copper smelting slag|slagging process]], but Cabrierés (France) used a primitive oxidizing non-slagging process (Bourgarit, et al. 2003), while in the British Isles the absence of debris, slag or ceramic suggests another technique (Craddock 1995).

Consequently, the way in which metallurgy was initiated differs considerably depending on the region. There are areas in which copper seems to play a crucial role (i.e., the Balkans), whereas other areas show no interest in it at all. Then there are societies that use copper artifacts but do not practice metallurgy (Mohen 1992; 71), and there are other ones that fully adopt some of the cultural innovations but ignore the rest. One example of the latter is [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]] in northern Spain, where splendid large [[dolmen]]s are present along the [[Ebro river]], but metal is rather infrequent, and when it does appear between the trapping, it is more often [[bronze]] or [[arsenical copper]] than [[copper]] (Cava 1984).

==Reasons to use copper==
Copper is the eighth most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, is available all over the world,  and is one of the few that can appear in a pure state (Atkinson 1987). It is not complicated to work with, and a bare hammering can be enough to transform a nugget into a bead. The eye-catching look of native copper makes it easy to recognize, and even flashier if converted into jewelry, a possible motivation for humankind to start the metallurgy with it. An evolutive technological process (Coghlan 1975, Mohen 1992; 48) has been described, although there are authors like Javinovic (Mohen 1992; 52) who think that it is not necessary to pass through the first stages to reach the last one.

===Converting copper===
[[Image:Native Copper Macro Digon3.jpg|thumb|Sample of native copper.]]
To start with, the raw material must be obtained. [[Copper]] can be found in over 160 different minerals (Atkinson 1987), but mining activities are entailed to obtain them in large quantities if a reasonable amount of copper is wanted. Some of the most commonly exploited minerals are [[cuprite]], [[malachite]], [[azurite]], [[chalcopyrite]], [[chrysocolla]] and [[tennantite]]; e.g. [[malachite]] was extracted in [[Rudna Glava]] (Serbia), Cabrierés (France) or Chinflón ([[Riotinto]], Spain). In fact, one of the possible explanations about what ''[[Ötzi the Iceman]]'', the ancient [[mummy]] found in the Alps who lived around 3300 years BC, was doing at {{convert|3210|m|ft|-1}} of altitude is that he could have been prospecting for new ores of minerals (Peroni 1996; 336).

Secondly, the mineral is separated from the [[gangue]]. This is only possible by [[smelting]] or [[beneficiation]]. To do so, it is necessary to use a furnace that is able to reach at least {{convert|1089|°C|°F|0}}.

Lastly, a wide range of specific tools and resources have to be available, such as furnaces, moulds, [[crucible]]s, mauls, etc.

*'''Stage A:''' Although [[native copper]] nowadays is frequently displayed in museum showcases of mineral collections, it once occurred copiously during prehistoric times. In [[Cyprus]] or [[Crete]], collecting the mineral was once as easy as simply picking it up from the ground. In fact, native copper is no longer as easy to find in that state these days. The treatment of this native mineral was also uncomplicated through cold-hammering. This only permitted the production of a limited range of artifacts like awls, pins, or beads. In larger objects, the metal cracks when it is cold-hammered.
*'''Stage B:''' Annealing the metal on an open fire ({{convert|200|-|300|°C|°F|-1|disp=or}} is hot enough) reduces its hardness considerably and gives in malleability. This permits the manufacture of slightly more sophisticated objects, like bracelets, but is still a rather limited technique.
*'''Stage C:''' In the first two steps, the mineral used was [[native copper]] that does not actually need specialized technology. Probably, due to the situation that native copper was increasingly difficult to find, copper ore is used in this third step. This is a very significant development. In fact, this is truly the beginning of the [[metallurgy]], as the mineral has to be smelted to separate the copper from the [[gangue]], requiring technology.

==Early mining in Europe==
[[Image:Chrysokoll Chrysocolla.jpg|thumb|Polished [[chrysocolla]].]]
Minerals of copper were known from ancient times. In Crete, little fragments of [[malachite]] and [[azurite]] were powdered and used as make up or to decorate ceramic in an early date such as 6000&amp;nbsp;BC (Mohen 1992).

Therefore, the minerals were not collected because people were looking for copper but for virtues like those mentioned or simply because of its brightness and colour, but this knowledge of the minerals is critical since they already knew how to recognize them and where to collect them when, later, they started the systematic search for ores.

Numerous examples of mines are known all over Europe (Craddock 1980, Mohen 1992 and 1996, Shennan 1999, Bartelheim et al. 2003) from the east: [[Rudna Glava]] (Serbia), Ai Bunar (Bulgaria); to the west: [[Mount Gabriel]] (Ireland), [[Great Orme]], [[Alderley Edge]] (United Kingdom); crossing Central Europe: [[Mitterberg]] (Salzach, Austria), [[Neuchâtel]] (Switzerland), Cabrierés (France); to the south: [[Riotinto]], [[Mola Alta de Serelles]] (Spain); and the Mediterranean: [[Corsica]], Cyprus, and the [[Cyclades]] islands. It is remarkable that, usually, it is not a single mine but a complex, with a variable, large number of mineshafts, as in [[Rudna Glava]] (30) or [[Mount Gabriel]] (31).

==Techniques and tools==
The techniques observed in all of them are quite similar. Basically they used the thermic alteration or firesetting (Mohen 1992, Craddock 1995, Eiroa et al. 1996, Timberlake 2003). This consists of applying fire to the rock and then pouring water over it: the rapid changes of temperature will cause cracks within the rocks that can be totally broken with the help of mauls and picks. Then the useful masses were selected, crushed and transported to the production centre that could be in the surrounding area ([[Mitterberg]]) or far away ([[Rudna Glava]]).

The mines were exploited in extremely efficient and clever ways, according to the technology available (Jovanovic 1980, Craddock 1995, Timberlake 2003). The entire convenient mineral was collected and the abandoned shafts carefully refilled with gangue and rocks (Mohen 1992; 85). For example, at [[Mount Gabriel]], it was estimated that they extracted the astonishing number of {{convert|32570.15|tonne}} of rock, gangue and ore. The usable amount of copper was 162.85 tonnes and the final smelting finished metal was 146.56 tonnes (Jackson 1980; 24). The entire process was thoroughly described in 1744 by Lewis Morris, Crown Mineral Agent for Cardiganshire, and, incidentally, [[antiquarian]] (Timberlake, 2003, 22):

{{cquote|Their method seems to be this. They make a great fire of wood in the bottom of their rakes which were always open up on that account, and when the rock was sufficiently hot they cast water upon it, which shiver’d it; and then with stone wedges, which they drove in with other stones, they work’d their way through the hardest rocks, tho’ but slowly.}}

The tools employed are mainly presented in Lewis' observations, but other ones have been recovered in archaeological context:
*&lt;span style="color:#515151"&gt;'''Stone tools:'''&lt;/span&gt; The most frequent find are the stone hammers, normally made of hard rocks accessible to the mine, beach or river pebbles (Jovanovic 1980, Craddock 1995). There is no standardization of these mauls but is common a system of hafting, usually a groove carved in the middle for where a rope was tied to the handle, like the twisted hazel recovered in [[Copa Hill]] (Timberlake 2003; 32-33).
* &lt;span style="color:#515151"&gt;'''Antler and bone tools:'''&lt;/span&gt; Picks and scrapes made of bone and [[antler]]s have been found in the majority of the mines (Craddock 1995).
* &lt;span style="color:#515151"&gt;'''Wood:'''&lt;/span&gt; Evidence of wooden tools are more infrequent. Nevertheless in places like Ai Bunar or [[Mount Gabriel]] were recovered [[shovel]]s and wedges. A rudimentary system of stairs or [[scaffolding]]s can be supposed (Mohen 1992).
* &lt;span style="color:#515151"&gt;'''Metal:'''&lt;/span&gt; The use of any metallic tool is rather strange and extraordinary. It seems that the copper was not used for the miners' tools. However copper [[chisel]]s and discarded axes could be utilized as wedges. (Craddock 1995; 97)
* &lt;span style="color:#515151"&gt;'''Other evidence:'''&lt;/span&gt; The presence of [[coal]] and [[charcoal]], crucial for the firing (fire-setting) and furnace (fuel), is habitual. Leather sacks (at Ai Bunar) and shoulder baskets (at Copa Hill) were used to transport the crushed mineral.

==Society==
The information available about the people of the [[Copper Age]] has not substantially increased along with the number of archaeological sites. Several ideas have been proffered, one of the most followed is that the metal itself did not bring abrupt transformation into the people's life (Cunliffe 1998) or even more that ''‘early copper does not produce anything useful at all’'' (Renfrew 1986, 146), meaning with this that with the copper, they produced mainly [[jewellery]] and, overall, weapons that obviously were not within reach of the majority of the population but only to privileged individuals. In other words, the real importance of the metal is not utilitarian but social. This is a suitable explanation about the rising of Great Cultures of Metal such as [[Vinča culture]] (Ex-Yugoslavia) [[Tiszapolgar]] and [[Unetice culture]] (Central Europe), [[Remedello culture|Remedello]] and [[Rinaldone]] (Italy), [[Montagne Noire]] (France), [[El Argar]] and [[Targas, Spain|Targas]] (Spain), etc.
[[Image:Or de Varna - Nécropole.jpg|right|thumb|Male tomb of Varna (Bulgaria). 5th millennium BC.]]

As the period moved forward, especially around the 3rd millennium, new and complex realities would appear strongly linked to the metal, like the impressive fortified villages of [[Los Millares]] (Spain), [[Vila Nova de Sao Pedro]] (Portugal) or the more modest [[cairn]] next to Copa Hill (United Kingdom) apparently destinated to control the centres of extraction, or the equally stunning and generalized cultural phenomenons of [[Megalithism]], [[Rock Art]], [[Bell Beakers]] Vessels… that are known from Scandinavia to the South of Spain and from Scotland to Turkey.

'''NICMOSlook''' is a computer program to analyze spectral data obtained with the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS) on board the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST). The program originated as ''Calnic C'', which was designed at the [[Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility]] (ST-ECF) and programmed in [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]]. NICMOSlook is available from their website.

One of the capabilities of NICMOS is its [[grism]] mode for slitless spectrometry at low resolution. Typically, a direct image is taken in conjunction with grism images for wavelength calibration. NICMOSlook is a highly specialized interactive tool to extract
one-dimensional spectra (flux versus wavelength) from such data.

NICMOSlook is most commonly used for small amounts of data when users prefer to have full control of all the parameters for individual spectrum extraction, or for cases where Calnic C did not extract the spectra satisfactorily. Unlike Calnic C, NICMOSlook requires the user to determine the best way to find an object and provides a number of different ways to accomplish this. Similarly, the user decides whether to use a weighting appropriate for point sources or weighting by the size of the object for the extraction of the spectra.

==Calnic C==
''Calnic C'' is a non-interactive counterpart, a program that performs a subset of NICMOSlook's functions with a "pipelined" approach.  Maintenance of Calnic C stopped in 2000 and the program is now considered to be obsolete.

'''''Pale Blue Dot''''' is a photograph of planet Earth taken on February 14, 1990, by the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' [[space probe]] from a record distance of about {{Nowrap|6 billion}} kilometers ({{nowrap|3.7 billion}} miles, 40.5 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]), as part of that day's [[Family Portrait (Voyager)|''Family Portrait'']] series of images of the [[Solar System]].

In the photograph, Earth's apparent size is less than a [[pixel]]; the planet appears as a tiny dot against the vastness of [[Outer space|space]], among bands of sunlight reflected by the camera.&lt;ref name=planet-soc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/earth/pale-blue-dot.html|title=A Pale Blue Dot|publisher=The Planetary Society|accessdate=December 21, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219181905/http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/earth/pale-blue-dot.html|archivedate=December 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Voyager 1'', which had completed its primary mission and was leaving the Solar System, was commanded by [[NASA]] to turn its camera around and take one last photograph of Earth across a great expanse of space, at the request of astronomer and author [[Carl Sagan]].&lt;ref name=fettss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fettss.arc.nasa.gov/collection/details/the-pale-blue-dot/|title=From Earth to the Solar System, The Pale Blue Dot|publisher=NASA|accessdate=December 24, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218203249/http://fettss.arc.nasa.gov/collection/details/the-pale-blue-dot/|archivedate=December 18, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In September 1977, [[NASA]] launched ''[[Voyager 1]]'', a {{convert|722|kg|lb|0|adj=on}} [[robotic spacecraft]] on a mission to study the outer Solar System and eventually [[interstellar space]].&lt;ref name=starbrite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starbrite.jpl.nasa.gov/pds/viewMissionProfile.jsp?MISSION_NAME=VOYAGER|title=Mission Overview|publisher=starbrite.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=July 27, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721052910/http://starbrite.jpl.nasa.gov/pds/viewMissionProfile.jsp?MISSION_NAME=VOYAGER|archivedate=July 21, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nssdc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1977-084A|title=Voyager 1|publisher=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=July 27, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017021829/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1977-084A|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Exploration of Jupiter|encounter with the Jovian system]] in 1979 and the [[Exploration of Saturn|Saturnian system]] in 1980, the primary mission was declared complete in November of the same year. ''Voyager 1'' was the first space probe to provide detailed images of the two largest planets and their major [[moons]].

[[File:Voyager.jpg|thumb|alt=A space probe resting on a stand, with a parabolic antenna pointing upwards and two arms extending from the sides, bearing cameras and other devices, against a black background curtain|The ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft]]
The spacecraft, still travelling at {{convert|40000|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}}, is the most distant man-made object from Earth and the first one to leave the Solar System.&lt;ref name=prescott /&gt; Its mission has been extended and continues to this day, with the aim of investigating the [[Solar System#Boundaries|boundaries of the Solar system]], including the [[Kuiper belt]], the [[heliosphere]] and interstellar space. Operating for {{Age in years, months and days| year=1977| month=09| day=5 }}  as of today ({{TODAY|(DMY)}}), it receives routine commands and transmits data back to the [[Deep Space Network]].&lt;ref name=starbrite/&gt;&lt;ref name=butrica&gt;{{cite book|last=Butrica|first=Andrew.J|title=From Engineering Science To Big Science|edition=1st|chapter=Chapter 11|page=251|year=1994|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0-679-43841-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/1280-earthly-view-mars.html|title=An Earthly View of Mars|publisher=space.com|accessdate=July 28, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814222908/http://www.space.com/1280-earthly-view-mars.html|archivedate=August 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Voyager 1'' was expected to work only through the Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed the idea of the space probe taking one last picture of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/497286371.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+25%2C+1995&amp;author=Craig+Marley&amp;pub=Waterloo+Region+Record&amp;desc=It's+our+dot+%3A+For+Carl+Sagan%2C+planet+Earth+is+just+a+launch+pad+for+human+explorations+of+the+outer+universe&amp;pqatl=google|title=It's our dot: For Carl Sagan, planet Earth is just a launch pad for human explorations of the outer universe|publisher=pqasb.pqarchiver.com|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for ''Voyager''{{'}}s cameras to make out any detail, but it would be meaningful as a perspective on [[Earth's location in the universe|our place in the universe]].

Although many in NASA's [[Voyager program]] were supportive of the idea, there were concerns that taking a picture of Earth so close to the Sun risked damaging the spacecraft's imaging system irreparably. It was not until 1989 that Sagan's idea was put into practice, but then instrument calibrations delayed the operation further, and the personnel who devised and transmitted the radio commands to ''Voyager 1'' were also being laid off or transferred to other projects. Finally, [[NASA Administrator]] [[Richard Truly]] interceded to ensure that the photograph was taken.&lt;ref name=prescott&gt;{{cite news|title=The Earth from the frontiers of the Solar system – The Pale, Blue Dot|first=Carl|last=Sagan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_upSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=noEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4800,1930437&amp;dq=pale-blue-dot+-book&amp;hl=en|newspaper=[[PARADE Magazine]]|date=September 9, 1990|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SaganPBD5&gt;Sagan, 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9hzqn9gWtAcC&amp;pg=PA5 pp. 4–5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123614938|title=An Alien View Of Earth|publisher=npr.org|accessdate=July 12, 2011|work=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721205333/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123614938|archivedate=July 21, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Camera ==
''Voyager 1''{{'}}s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) consisted of two cameras: a 200&amp;nbsp;mm [[focal length]], low-resolution wide-angle camera (WA), used for spatially extended imaging, and a 1500&amp;nbsp;mm high-resolution narrow-angle camera (NA) – the one that took ''Pale Blue Dot'' – intended for detailed imaging of specific targets. Both cameras were of the slow-scan [[vidicon]] tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on a filter wheel placed in front of the tube.&lt;ref name=narrow-angle&gt;{{cite web|title=Voyager – Imaging Science Subsystem|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/instruments_iss_na.html|website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|publisher=NASA|accessdate=December 26, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213000000/http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/instruments_iss_na.html|archivedate=February 13, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cassini&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/cassiniorbiterinstruments/instrumentscassiniiss/|title=Cassini Solstice Mission – ISS|publisher=NASA|accessdate=December 26, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114074323/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/cassiniorbiterinstruments/instrumentscassiniiss/|archivedate=January 14, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge was that, as the mission progressed, the objects to be photographed would increasingly be farther away and would appear fainter, requiring [[Long-exposure photography|longer exposures]] and slewing (panning) of the cameras to achieve acceptable quality. The telecommunication capability also diminished with distance, limiting the number of data modes that could be used by the imaging system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pds-rings.seti.org/voyager/iss/inst_cat_na1.html|title=Voyager 1 Narrow Angle Camera Description|website=Planetary Rings Node|publisher=SETI Institute|accessdate=December 26, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101205044/http://pds-rings.seti.org/voyager/iss/inst_cat_na1.html|archivedate=January 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series of commands were compiled and sent to Voyager, with the images executed on February 14, 1990.

After taking the [[Family Portrait (Voyager)|''Family Portrait'']] series of images, which included ''Pale Blue Dot'', NASA mission managers commanded ''Voyager 1'' to power its cameras down, as the spacecraft was not going to fly near anything else of significance for the rest of its mission, while other instruments that were still collecting data needed power for the long journey to interstellar space.&lt;ref name=mission_pages&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager-20100212.html|title=Voyager Celebrates 20-Year-Old Valentine to Solar System|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=June 23, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419073002/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager-20100212.html|archivedate=April 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photograph ==
The design of the command sequence to be relayed to the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph's exposure time were developed by space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) and [[Carolyn Porco]] of the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref name=SaganPBD5/&gt; After the planned imaging sequence was taken on February 14, 1990, the data from the camera were stored initially in an on-board [[tape recorder]]. Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the ''[[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]]'' and ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' missions being given priority over the use of the [[Deep Space Network]]. Then, between March and May 1990, ''Voyager 1'' returned 60 [[Film frame|frames]] back to Earth, with the radio signal travelling at the speed of light for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.&lt;ref name=prescott /&gt;

Three of the frames received showed the Earth as a tiny point of light in empty space. Each frame had been taken using a different color filter: blue, green and violet, with exposure times of 0.72, 0.48 and 0.72 seconds respectively. The three frames were then recombined to produce the image that became ''Pale Blue Dot''.&lt;ref name=photojournal_452&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00452|title=PIA00452: Solar System Portrait – Earth as 'Pale Blue Dot'|publisher=photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=July 27, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718143531/http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00452|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=photojournal_450&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00450|title=PIA00450: Solar System Portrait – View of the Sun, Earth and Venus|publisher=photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=July 28, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705195723/http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00450|archivedate=July 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 640,000 individual [[pixel]]s that compose each frame, Earth takes up less than one (0.12 of a pixel, according to NASA). The light bands across the photograph are an [[Artifact (error)|artifact]], the result of sunlight reflecting off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth.&lt;ref name=prescott /&gt;&lt;ref name=solarsystem&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=2148|title=Solar System Exploration-Pale Blue Dot|publisher=solarsystem.nasa.gov|accessdate=July 27, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113005119/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=2148|archivedate=November 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Voyager's'' point of view was approximately 32° above the [[ecliptic]]. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the [[Moon]], although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.&lt;ref name=photojournal_450 /&gt;

The pale blue color of the dot is the result of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and [[Rayleigh scattering|scattering]] of the light reflected from Earth. The polarization in turn depends on various factors such as cloud cover, exposed areas of oceans, forests, deserts, snow fields etc.&lt;ref name=planetquest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/40738514/Polarization-of-terrestrial-planets-and-the-ZIMPOL-technique|title=Polarization of terrestrial planets and the ZIMPOL technique|publisher=planetquest1.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=July 27, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208135228/http://www.docstoc.com/docs/40738514/Polarization-of-terrestrial-planets-and-the-ZIMPOL-technique|archivedate=December 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woolf|first1=N.J.|last2=Smith|first2=P.S.|last3=Traub|first3=W.A.|last4=Jucks|first4=K.W. |date=March 28, 2002 |title=The Spectrum of Earthshine: A Pale Blue Dot Observed from the Ground|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=574|issue=1|pages=430|publisher=The American Astronomical Society|doi=10.1086/340929|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/574/1/430/pdf/55556.web.pdf|accessdate=December 5, 2014|arxiv = astro-ph/0203465 |bibcode = 2002ApJ...574..430W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pale Blue Dot'', which was taken with the narrow-angle camera, was also published as part of a composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: ''Pale Blue Dot'' and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.&lt;ref name=photojournal_450/&gt;

== Reflections ==
[[File:PaleBlueDot.jpg|thumb|alt=Pale blue dot image with a wider field of view to show more background|Sagan pointed out that on that dot, "every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives".]]
During a public lecture at [[Cornell University]] in 1994, [[Carl Sagan]] presented the image to the audience and shared his reflections on the deeper meaning behind the idea of the ''Pale Blue Dot'':&lt;ref name="Big Sky"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Pale Blue Dot|url=http://www.bigskyastroclub.org/pale_blue_dot.html|website=The Big Sky Astronomy Club|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618231449/http://www.bigskyastroclub.org/pale_blue_dot.html|dead-url=no|archive-date=June 18, 2017|accessdate=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=We succeeded in taking that picture [from deep space], and, if you look at it, you see a dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings, thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child, every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.

Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity – in all this vastness – there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. It is up to us. It's been said that astronomy is a humbling, and I might add, a character-building experience. To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

'''''Parallel Worlds: A Journey Through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos''''' is a [[popular science]] book by [[Michio Kaku]] first published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaku|first=Michio|title=Parallel Worlds: A Journey Through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos|date=2004|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-50986-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The book has twelve chapters arranged in three parts. Part I (Chapters 1-4) covers the Big Bang, the early development of the Universe, and how these topics relate to the Eternal Inflation Multiverse (Level II in the Tegmark hierarchy of Multiverses). Part II (Chapters 5-9) covers M-Theory and the Everett interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (Level III Multiverse). It also discusses how future technology will enable the creation of wormholes. Part III discusses the [[Big Freeze]] and how a Hyperspace wormhole (one in 11-dimensional Hyperspace rather than 3-dimensional normal space) will enable civilization and life to escape to a younger Universe.

==Theme==
In ''Parallel Worlds'', Kaku presents many of the leading theories in physics; from [[Newtonian physics]] to [[theory of relativity|Relativity]] to [[Quantum Physics]] to [[String theory]] and even into the newest version of string theory, called [[M-theory]]. He makes available to the reader a comprehensive description of many of the more compelling theories in physics, including many interesting predictions each theory makes, what [[physicist]]s, [[astronomer]]s, and [[cosmologist]]s are looking for now and what technology they are using in their search.

==Reception==
Scarlett Thomas writing for ''[[The Independent]]'' calls ''Parallel Worlds'' "absolutely impossible to put down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Scarlett|title=Bets with the cosmic bookmaker|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/parallel-worlds-by-michio-kaku-758577.html|accessdate=28 May 2011|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=February 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Mortimer for ''[[Universe Today]]''  felt the book maintains a nice balance between detail and corollary while sometimes drifting to the philosophical side of things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mortimer|first=Mark|title=Book Review: Parallel Worlds|url=http://www.universetoday.com/8010/book-review-parallel-worlds/|publisher=[[Universe Today]]|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerry Gilmore for ''[[The Guardian]]'', however,  mocks the notion of trying to escape the far off [[heat death of the universe]], and Gilmore also inaccurately describes the [[Microwave background|background radiation of the Big Bang]] as "sound waves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilmore|first=Gerry|title=Bang up to date?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/30/featuresreviews.guardianreview21|accessdate=28 May 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a finalist for the [[Samuel Johnson Prize]] for non-fiction in [[United Kingdom|the UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaku|first=Michio|title=Samuel Johnson Prize for Non Fiction 2005 - Longlist|url=http://www.thesamueljohnsonprize.co.uk/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=81|work=Parallel Worlds|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Penurbia''' describes country districts close to [[metropolitan areas]] in the United States.

Penurban districts look like rural areas. They are, however, heavily influenced through emigration by metropolitan settlers.

Settlers to penurbia are attracted by rural ambience. Many incomers, though, carry metropolitan ideas with them in their journeys from built up urban areas, even as they build a new-country self-conception. Consequently, penurbanites construct a unique mindset which blends an appreciation of country values with reliance on metropolitan incomes.

'''Peter Satir''' is a [[microbiology|microbiologist]] who has spent his career studying the basis of motion by studying the [[cilium]]. He is a native of New York, graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1952, received his Ph.D. from the [[Rockefeller University]] in 1961 and currently works at the Department of Anatomy and Structural Biology at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]].

==Education==
His interest in biology came from the first day in high school biology when he looked in a microscope, saw a ''Paramecium'' and asked his teacher how its cilia move. He says, "At the age of fourteen, I had asked the question which still dominates my research interests. Of course, I still had a long way to go to be a biologist."

After high school, he went to [[Columbia University]] where he was the only [[zoology]] major. He met his wife Birgit while studying in Denmark. After their marriage, they moved to Chicago, where they worked in Biology and Zoology at the [[University of Chicago]]. While not permitted to work under the same supervisor, they were permitted to work in the same department.

==Career==
In 1967, Satir was appointed Associate Professor of Anatomy in [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] bringing experience in [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]] and modern cell biology to the department. They went to the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] because it offers individual faculty positions to spouses.

==Awards==
In 2005, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Copenhagen]].

'''Prometheanism''' is a term popularized by the political theorist [[John Dryzek]] to describe an environmental orientation which perceives the Earth as a resource whose [[utility]] is determined primarily by human needs and interests and whose environmental problems are overcome through human innovation. The term was introduced in Dryzek's work, ''The Politics of the Earth: Environmental Discourses'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dryzek|first1=John|title=The Politics of the Earth: Environmental Discourses|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199696000|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-politics-of-the-earth-9780199696000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast with other environmental perspectives, Prometheanism prioritizes human interests and needs over those of ecosystems (as with [[deep ecology]]) or the individual needs of creatures (as in [[eco-feminism]]).

In his 1992 book ''Green Delusions: An Environmentalist Critique of Radical Environmentalism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Martin|title=Green Delusions: An Environmentalist Critique of Radical Environmentalism|date=1992|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=0822312573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Lewis offered one of the first systematic comparisons of how Promethean environmentalism differs from traditional Arcadian forms of environmentalism such as [[deep ecology]].

The '''Saraswati Supercluster''' is a massive [[galaxy supercluster]] about 1.2 [[gigaparsec]]s (4,000 million [[light year]]s) away within the [[Stripe 82]] region of [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], in the direction of the [[constellation]] [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]].&lt;ref name=Bagchi2017&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa7949|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/aa7949|arxiv=1707.03082|volume=844|pages=25|title=Saraswati: An Extremely Massive ~ 200 Megaparsec Scale Supercluster|year=2017|first1=Joydeep|last1=Bagchi|first2=Shishir|last2=Sankhyayan|first3=Prakash|last3=Sarkar|first4=Somak|last4=Raychaudhury|author-link4=Somak Raychaudhury|first5=Joe|last5=Jacob|first6=Pratik|last6=Dabhade|access-date = 2017-07-30|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|bibcode = 2017ApJ...844...25B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/07/13/ciencia/1499967116_043113.html|title=Descubierta Sarasvati, una de las mayores estructuras del universo|language=es|date=14 July 2017|access-date=14 July 2017|publisher=[[El País]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the [[List of largest cosmic structures|largest structures]] found in the [[Observable universe|universe]], with a major axis in diameter of about 200 Mpc (652 million light years).

==Discovery==

The Saraswati supercluster was discovered by a team of astrophysicists from the [[Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics]] and [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research]] led by J. Bagchi and colleagues in [[Pune]], [[India]]. Analyzing the data of Stripe 82 of the comprehensive [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]], particularly the sets of LOWZ data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the DR12 catalogue of the SDSS, the team discovered an overdensity of the sampled 625 galaxies from LOWZ and 3,016 from the LEGACY-BOSS-SOUTHERN, a survey of the southern sky that is also a part of SDSS DR12. It was discovered in 2017.&lt;ref name=Bagchi2017/&gt;

==Cosmology==

The Saraswati Supercluster is one of the [[List of largest cosmic structures|largest and most massive superclusters known]], comparable to the massive [[Shapley Concentration]] in the nearby universe. The supercluster consists of 43 massive galaxy clusters, which include Abell 2361 and ZWCl 2341.1+0000. It is surrounded by a network of galaxy filaments, clusters, and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]].

The Saraswati supercluster and its environs reveal that some extreme large-scale, prominent matter density enhancements had formed in the past when [[dark energy]] had just started to dominate structure formation. This galactic concentration sheds light on the role of dark energy and cosmological initial conditions in supercluster formation.&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite web | title = Galaxy supercluster is one of the biggest things in the universe | date = 14 July 2017 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/2140847-galaxy-supercluster-is-one-of-the-biggest-things-in-the-universe/ | access-date = 12 January 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171008104633/https://www.newscientist.com/article/2140847-galaxy-supercluster-is-one-of-the-biggest-things-in-the-universe/ | archive-date = 8 October 2017 | website = NewScientist | last = Crane | first = Leah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;{{cite web | title = 'Saraswati': A Supercluster Of Galaxies Discovered By Indian Scientists | date = 14 July 2017 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/07/13/saraswati-a-supercluster-of-galaxies-discovered-by-indian-sci_a_23029293/ | access-date = 12 January 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170714091956/http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/07/13/saraswati-a-supercluster-of-galaxies-discovered-by-indian-sci_a_23029293/ | archive-date = 14 July 2017 | website = HuffingtonPost| last = | first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shannon–Weaver model of communication''' has been called the "mother of all models."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering | author = Erik Hollnagel and David D. Woods | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-8493-2821-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IwRHwOK2IzYC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=Shannon%E2%80%93Weaver+model | location = Boca Raton, FL }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social Scientists use the term to refer to an integrated model of the concepts of [[Information theory#Source theory|information source]], [[message]], [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmitter]], [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]], [[channel (communications)|channel]], [[signal noise|noise]], [[receiver (information theory)|receiver]], information destination, probability of error, [[encoding]], [[Code|decoding]], [[Information theory#Rate|information rate]], [[channel capacity]], etc. However, some consider the name to be misleading, asserting that the most significant ideas were developed by Shannon alone.&lt;ref name="ShannonWeaverRant"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rF9Yq4zC0 "Rant in the defense of Shannon's contribution: the father of the digital age"], YouTube video, Martin Hilbert, Prof. UC Davis (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 [[Claude Elwood Shannon]] published ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]'' article in two parts in the July and October numbers of the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Claude Shannon | journal = [[Bell System Technical Journal]] | title = A Mathematical Theory of Communication | year = 1948 | volume = 27 | issue = July and October | pages =379–423, 623–656}} ([http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6773024 July], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6773067 October])&lt;/ref&gt; In this fundamental work he used tools in probability theory, developed by [[Norbert Wiener]], which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time.  Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing what became known as the dominant form of [[information theory]].

The book co-authored with [[Warren Weaver]], ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication'', reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Mathematical Theory of Communication | author = Claude E. Shannon and Warren Weaver | year = 1963 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | isbn = 0-252-72548-4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dk0n_eGcqsUC&amp;pg=PP1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, Weaver reprinted Shannon's two-part paper, wrote a 28 page introduction for a 144 pages book, and changed the title from "A Mathematical Theory . . ." to "The Mathematical Theory . . .". Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in [[John Robinson Pierce]]'s ''Symbols, Signals, and Noise'', a popular introduction for non-specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals &amp; Noise | author = John Robinson Pierce | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fXxde44_0zsC&amp;pg=PR9 | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-486-24061-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Shannon–Weaver model'' was widely adopted in [[social science]] fields such as education, [[communication sciences]], organizational analysis, psychology, etc. At the same time, it has been subject to much criticism in the social sciences, as it is supposedly "inappropriate to represent social processes"&lt;ref name="U.S.OTA"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MuhaVuB-21MC "Global communications : opportunities for trade and aid"] U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment. (1995). (OTA-ITC-642nd ed.). U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; and  "misleading misrepresentation of the nature of human communication", citing its simplicity and inability to consider context.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation | url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html | title=The Transmission Model of communications | author=Daniel Chandler | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120716111950/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html | archivedate=2012-07-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[engineering]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[biology]] Shannon's theory is used more literally and is referred to as ''Shannon theory'', or [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=334156.334169 | chapter = Fifty Years of Shannon Theory | author =  Sergio Verdü | title = Information Theory: 50 Years of Discovery | isbn = 0-7803-5363-3 | year = 2000 | pages = 13–34 | publisher = IEEE Press | editor = Sergio Verdü and Steven W. McLaughlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that outside of the social sciences, fewer people refer to a "Shannon–Weaver" model than to Shannon's [[information theory]]; some may consider it a misinterpretation to attribute the information theoretic channel logic to Weaver as well.&lt;ref name="ShannonWeaverRant"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2074">'''Statistical regularity''' is a notion in [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]] that random events exhibit regularity when repeated enough times or that enough sufficiently similar random events exhibit regularity. It is an [[umbrella term]] that covers the [[law of large numbers]], all [[central limit theorem]]s and [[ergodic theorem]]s.

If one throws a die once, it is difficult to predict the outcome, but if we repeat this experiment many times, we will see that the number of times each result occurs divided by the number of throws will eventually stabilize towards a specific value.

Repeating a series of trials will produce similar, but not identical, results for each series: the average, the standard deviation and other distributional characteristics will be around the same for each series of trials.

The notion is used in [[games of chance]], [[demographic statistics]], [[quality control]] of a manufacturing process, and in many other parts of our lives.

Observations of this phenomenon provided the initial motivation for the concept of what is now known as [[frequency probability]].

This phenomenon should not be confused with the [[gambler's fallacy]], because regularity only refers to the (possibly very) long run. The gambler's fallacy does not apply to statistical regularity because the latter considers the whole rather than individual cases.

'''The Future of Things''' (TFOT) is an online [[magazine]] covering diverse topics related to [[science]] and [[technology]]. The magazine was launched in 2006.

==History==
TFOT was founded by Iddo Genuth and co-founder Barak Raz in early 2006 and its [[beta testing|beta]] version was first launched on the 27 of September 2006. During beta the site included two sections – [[Picture]] of the Day (PODs) and Articles. In mid-2007 TFOT launched its full version with several new sections and a new design. Its team has more than 20 writers, from various countries worldwide. As of 2013 TFOT has been running under a different management.

==Sections==
As of September 2008, TFOT had several sections including: [[headlines]], [[news]], PODs, [[personals|personal columns]], [[book]] reviews and forums. TFOT also includes full articles which typically contain a Q&amp;A section which, according to TFOT, is a more accurate way of doing an [[interview]]. In January 2009 TFOT added a video section featuring science and technology related videos from the web as well as original video clips produced by the TFOT team. Another change in 2009 was the expansion of the daily RSS service, providing headlines from similar websites among the original research published in the website. Until then, a smaller number of headlines were uploaded each day.

==Scoops==
On August 22, 2007 TFOT was the first to extensively cover the [[Israel]]i company Mempile TeraDisc 1TB [[optical storage]] technology. The article was later picked up by numerous websites including [[Engadget]] [https://www.engadget.com/2007/08/23/mempiles-teradisc-fits-1tb-on-a-single-optical-disc/], [[tgdaily]] [http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/33582/135/] and [[arstechnica]] [https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070829-new-dvd-sized-disc-to-hold-terabytes-of-data.html]. On January 14, 2009 TFOT exclusively reported on advancements in laser hard drive development [http://thefutureofthings.com/news/6186/laser-hard-drives-in-the-making.html]. This news was quickly picked up by several publications including [[Engadget]][https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/15/laser-hard-drives-boast-1tbits-s-access-time-doesnt-exist-yet/] and [[electronista]] [http://www.electronista.com/articles/09/01/15/laser.hard.drives.coming/].

==Criticism==
Since its launch in early 2008, TFOT's headlines section was criticized several times for being too short (approx 500 characters); this, however, is probably the result of copyright issues.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} A different criticism was raised regarding the relatively short term look at the future of science and technology on TFOT as the site typically deals with research and technology for the next 5–10 years or so.

'''''The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen''''' is a 2011 book by the theoretical [[physicist]]s [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] and [[Jeff Forshaw]].

==Overview==
The book aims to provide an explanation of [[quantum mechanics]] and its impact on the modern world that is accessible to a general reader. The authors say that "our goal in writing this book is to demystify quantum theory". Starting with the concepts of [[wave–particle duality]] and a non-technical description of the [[path integral formulation]] of quantum mechanics, the book explains the [[uncertainty principle]], energy levels in atoms, the physics of semi-conductors and transistors, and the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics. A more mathematical Epilogue discusses the role of quantum mechanics in models of stellar evolution, and derives the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] for the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf.

'''''The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientist's Quest for What Makes Us Human''''' is a 2010 nonfiction book by [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran|V. S. Ramachandran]] that explores, from a neurological viewpoint, the uniqueness of human nature. Ramachandran explores various aspects of visual perception and cognition to argue that humans are unique among species. For example, he notes that although animals show [[cortical remapping]] after the loss of a limb, the plasticity seen in the human brain (after amputation) is much more dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Peter, Book Review, Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Vol. 17, Issue 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramachandran discusses seven main concepts which define the human aspect of [[self]] and how each may be disrupted by a specific neurological disorder.  The concepts are: unity, continuity, embodiment, privacy, social embedding, free-will, and self-awareness.

==Reception==
''Tell-Tale Brain'' was on the New York Times best-seller list (Number 32 on the Hardcover Nonfiction list)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-02-20/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|title=Hardcover Nonfiction Books - Best Sellers - February 20, 2011 - The New York Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received mostly highly positive with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbc.ucsd.edu/press.html|title=The Center for Brain and Cognition - Home|website=cbc.ucsd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book won the 2010 [[Vodafone Crossword Book Award]] (Non-Fiction).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/vodafone-crossword-book-awards-2010-announced/180813-40-100.html "Vodafone Crossword book awards 2010 announced"], IBN Live, Sep 03&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive reviews ==

[[Oliver Sacks]] writes “No one is better than V. S. Ramachandran at combining minute, careful observation with ingenious experiments and bold, adventurous theorizing. The Tell-Tale Brain is Ramachandran at his best, a profoundly intriguing and compelling guide to the intricacies of the human brain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Tell-Tale-Brain-Neuroscientists-Quest-Makes/dp/0393077829/133-8201841-3538510?_encoding=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;ref_=dp_proddesc_0&amp;s=books|title=The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientist's Quest for What Makes Us Human|first=search|last=results|date=17 January 2011|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allan Snyder, Director of the Center for the Mind, said that the books is: “A masterpiece. The best of its kind and beautifully crafted. Alluring story telling, building to a penetrating understanding of what it is to be uniquely human. Ramachandran is the foremost pioneer—the Galileo—of neurocognition.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Tell-Tale-Brain-Neuroscientists-Quest-Makes/dp/0393077829/131-9291652-8282259?_encoding=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;ref_=dp_proddesc_0&amp;s=books|title=The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientist's Quest for What Makes Us Human|first=search|last=results|date=17 January 2011|publisher=W.

Norman Doidge, M.D., author of The Brain That Changes Itself praised the book by saying:“Ramachandran is the modern wizard of neuroscience. In The Tell-Tale Brain, we see the genius at work, tackling extraordinary cases, many of which mark turning points in neuroscientific knowledge. We see him hypothesizing, experimenting, failing, having epiphanies, experimenting, succeeding. In this utterly entertaining account, we see how these fascinating cases fit together, and how he uses them to explain, from a Darwinian point of view, how our brains, though evolved from those of other animals, become neurologically distinct and fundamentally human.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Tell-Tale-Brain-Neuroscientists-Quest-Makes/dp/0393077829/137-4519162-4049053?_encoding=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;ref_=dp_proddesc_0&amp;s=books|title=The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientist's Quest for What Makes Us Human|first=search|last=results|date=17 January 2011|publisher=W.

In the Sunday Times, James McConnachie writes: "When VS Ramachandran, one of the world’s most influential neurologists, wants to get inside a human head, he doesn’t reach for his scalpel or MRI scanner. Instead, like Sherlock Holmes (to whom he is often compared), he seizes on an oddity in a case study, then begins a pleasing process of deduction interspersed with leaps of excitingly creative thought. This absorbing book charts the acclaimed experiments he has performed around the world and at the University of California’s cutting-edge Centre for the Brain, and explains how they have helped unravel the workings of the human mind."&lt;ref&gt;James McConnachie, The Tell-Tale Brain by VS Ramachandran, The Sunday Times, January 09, 2011 [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/books/non_fiction/article500581.ece?pagewanted=all]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reviews ==

In his review for the American Scientist, [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at Cambridge University, said he found the book stimulating and enjoyable but questioned the validity of Ramachandran's views on the importance of mirror neurons. In particular, Baron-Cohen took issue with Ramachandran's well known prediction "... that mirror neurons will do for psychology what DNA did for biology: they will provide a unifying framework and help explain a host of mental abilities that have hitherto remained mysterious and inaccessible to experiments.” Baron-Cohen stated "Whether [Ramachandran] has overstated the importance of mirror neurons and will decide to retract this statement remains to be seen." Baron-Cohen, who is Director of the Autism Research Center at Cambridge University, pointed out that Ramachandran has failed to acknowledge the experimental evidence that contradicts his theory that dysfunctional mirror neurons play a significant role in [[autism]]. Baron-Cohen writes "There are also clinical and experimental reasons for being skeptical of the broken-mirror theory of autism... As an explanation of autism, the [Broken Mirror] theory offers some tantalizing clues; however, some problematic counter-evidence challenges the theory and particularly its scope.".&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, Making Sense of the Brain's Mysteries, American Scientist, On-line Book Review, July–August, 2011 [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/making-sense-of-the-brains-mysteries]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Baron-Cohen, however, does not address numerous other chapters and ideas discussed in the book. Ramachandran himself, has noted (even in the Tell-Tale Brain) that the evidence for the Broken Mirror Theory of autism, is, at present, "Compelling but not conclusive".

In the New York Times, [[Anthony Gottlieb]] criticized Ramachandran for not mentioning that his ideas about the importance of mirror neurons are controversial:

"Although Ramachandran admits that his account of the significance of mirror neurons is speculative, he doesn’t let on just how controversial it is. In the past four years, a spate of studies has dented every part of the mirror-neuron story. Doubt has been cast on the idea that imitation and the understanding of actions depend on mirror neurons, and on the theory that autism involves a defect in these systems of cells. It has even been claimed that the techniques used to detect the activity of mirror neurons have been widely misinterpreted. Ramachandran may have good reason to discount these skeptical studies, but he surely should have mentioned them.".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Gottlieb, A Lion in the Undergrowth, Sunday Book Review, January 28, 2011 [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/books/review/Gottlieb-t.html?pagewanted=all]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his footnotes, Ramachandran does in fact point out the controversy surrounding mirror neurons.

[[Nicholas Shakespeare]], the well-known British writer, felt that Ramachandran did not fully engage the ideas presented in the book:

"Ramachandran wanders along intriguing neural pathways, pausing to investigate strange disorders, but he leaves the impression that he is an explorer who has yet to leave the coast. Further, he appears not fully to appreciate that the interior of this vast continent he is mapping may be at war. His book is intermittently fascinating, but is not important in the way of Iain McGilchrist The Master and His Emissary, last year’s magisterial study of the brain’s two opposed hemispheres, which it nicely (though unintentionally) complements – even to the extent of using some of the same illustrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8243355/The-Tell-Tale-Brain-Unlocking-the-Mystery-ofHuman-Nature-by-V-S-Ramachandran-review.html|title=The Tell-Tale Brain: Unlocking the Mystery of Human Nature by V S Ramachandran: review|first=Nicholas|last=Shakespeare|date=5 October 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for the Wall Street Journal, [[Raymond Tallis]], emeritus professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Manchester complained that Ramachandran has failed to provide the research needed to back up his theories:

"The trouble begins when the neurologist turns philosopher and tries to use these insights to get closer to "what makes us human." He suggests that such cross-wiring underpins both humans' ability to enjoy metaphors and artists' capacity to create novel connections—an assertion that has scarcely any research to back it up. (What little has been done depends on laughably simplistic models of how metaphors and creativity really work.) Likewise, his explanation of how we became speaking animals has scarcely a toe-hold on empirical data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704034804576025681468057572|title=The Mind in the Mirror|first=Raymond|last=Tallis|date=8 January 2011|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pterodactylus holotype fly mmartyniuk.png|thumb|right|upright|350px|Life restoration of the first scientifically studied pterosaur, ''[[Pterodactylus]]'']]
This '''timeline of pterosaur research''' is a chronologically ordered list of important [[fossil]] discoveries, controversies of interpretation, and [[Biological taxonomy|taxonomic]] revisions of [[pterosaur]]s, the famed flying reptiles of the [[Mesozoic]] [[Era (geology)|era]]. Although pterosaurs went extinct millions of years before humans evolved, humans have coexisted with pterosaur fossils for millennia. Before the development of paleontology as a formal science, these remains would have been interpreted through a [[mythological]] lens. Myths about [[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbirds]] told by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the modern western [[United States]] may have been influenced by observations of ''[[Pteranodon]]'' fossils. These thunderbirds were said to have warred with water monsters, which agrees well with the co-occurrence of ''Pteranodon'' and the ancient [[marine reptile]]s of the [[Western Interior Seaway|seaway]] over which it flew.&lt;ref name="mayor-cheyenne-209-211-221" /&gt;

The formal study of pterosaurs began in the late 18th century when [[naturalist]] [[Cosimo Alessandro Collini]] of [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]] published a description of an unusual animal with long arms, each bearing an elongated finger. He recognized that this long finger could support a membrane like that of a [[bat]] wing, but because the unnamed creature was found in deposits that preserve marine life he concluded that these strange arms were used as [[Flipper (anatomy)|flippers]].&lt;ref name=wellnhofer-2008-early-8 /&gt; The creature was restudied again in the very early 19th century by [[French people|French]] anatomist [[Georges Cuvier]], who recognized both that the creature was a [[reptile]] and that its "flippers" were wings. He called the creature the ''Ptero-dactyle'', a name since revised to ''[[Pterodactylus]]''.&lt;ref name=wellnhofer-2008-early-8-9 /&gt;

Although Cuvier's interpretation later became the consensus, it was just one of many early interpretations of the creature and its relatives, including that they were bats, strange [[birds]], or the primordial handiwork of [[Satan]] himself.&lt;ref name=wellnhofer-oconnor-hawkins /&gt; Similar animals like the long-tailed ''[[Rhamphorhynchus]]'' and ''[[Gnathosaurus]]'' were soon discovered around Europe and it became obvious that earth was once home to a diverse group of flying reptiles.&lt;ref name="hanson-r-g" /&gt; The [[United Kingdom|British]] anatomist [[Sir Richard Owen]] dubbed this vanished order the Pterosauria. Soon after, he described Britain's own first pterosaur, ''[[Dimorphodon]]''.&lt;ref name=wellnhofer-2008-owen-10 /&gt; Later in the 19th century pterosaurs were discovered in [[North America]] as well, the first of which was a spectacular animal named ''[[Pteranodon]]'' by paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh]].&lt;ref name=wellnhofer-2008-american-11 /&gt;

Various aspects of pterosaur biology invited controversy from the beginning. [[Samuel Thomas von Soemmering]] ignited a multi-century debate over how pterosaurs walked on the ground by suggesting they crawled on all fours like bats. [[August Quenstedt]], by contrast, argued that they walked on their hind limbs.&lt;ref name=wellnhofer-2008-terrestrial-14 /&gt; In the early 20th century, Hankin and Watson in the first major study of pterosaur flight [[biomechanics]] concluded that on the ground these reptiles were altogether helpless and could only scoot along on their stomachs like [[penguins]].&lt;ref name=wellnhofer-2008-flight-ground /&gt; The debate gained steam in 1957 when [[William Lee Stokes|William Stokes]] reported unusual [[Fossil footprint|tracks]] left by a four-footed animal he suspected was a pterosaur walking along the ground.&lt;ref name=wellnhofer-2008-terrestrial-15 /&gt; In 1984, [[Kevin Padian]], who had recently argued that pterosaurs walked on their hind legs, dismissed Stokes's tracks as those of a [[crocodilian]].&lt;ref name=padian-gait-tracks /&gt; However, in the mid-1990s, [[Jean-Michel Mazin]] and others reported that fossil footprints in [[Crayssac]], France were similar to those reported by Stokes from the US. Mazin's tracks were more obviously pterosaurian in origin and settled the debate in favor of pterosaurs walking on all fours.&lt;ref name=wellnhofer-2008-terrestrial-15 /&gt;

Pterosaur paleontology continues to progress into the 21st century. In fact, according to [[David Hone]] the early 21st century has seen more progress in pterosaur paleontology than in "the preceding two centuries" combined. He compared this transformative period in pterosaur paleontology to the [[Dinosaur Renaissance]] of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="hone-abs-1366" /&gt; He also observed that roughly one-third of known pterosaurs were discovered during this brief interval.&lt;ref name="hone-out-1367" /&gt; One of the most notable of these was ''[[Darwinopterus]]'', whose body resembled the more primitive long-tailed "rhamphorynchoids", while its skull resembled those of the more advanced short-tailed [[pterodactyloids]].&lt;ref name="hone-new-1367" /&gt; These traits establish the species as an important transitional form, documenting one of the most important phases of [[pterosaur evolution]].&lt;ref name="hone-new-1367-1368" /&gt; Another important new species is ''[[Faxinalipterus minima]]'', which might well be the world's oldest pterosaur.&lt;ref name="hone-origins-1369" /&gt; The first confirmed pterosaur [[Reptile egg fossil|eggs]] were also reported from [[China]] during the early 21st century.&lt;ref name="hone-new-1368" /&gt;

==Prescientific==
*&lt;p&gt;The [[Cheyenne people]] of Nebraska believed in mythical [[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird]]s and water monsters that were in endless conflict with each other. The thunderbirds were said to resemble giant [[eagle]]s and killed both people and animals with arrows made of [[lightning]]. People occasionally discovered stony arrowheads thought to come from the thunderbirds' arrows. According to [[folklorist]] [[Adrienne Mayor]], these supposed arrowheads were likely fossil [[Belemnitida|belemnites]], which were compared to missiles by other indigenous American cultures, like the [[Zuni people]].&lt;ref name="mayor-cheyenne-209-210" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fossils of the Niobrara chalk may have been influential on these stories. The [[pterosaur]] ''[[Pteranodon]]'' and [[marine reptile]]s like [[mosasaur]]s are preserved in [[Niobrara Chalk]] deposits and associated remains may have been interpreted as evidence for antagonism between immense flying animals and serpentine aquatic reptiles. Fossils of the large toothed diving bird ''[[Hesperornis]]'' are also found in the Niobrara chalk, sometimes preserved inside specimens of large predatory marine reptiles. Observations of similar fossils in the past may have been seen as further evidence for thunderbird-water monster conflict.&lt;ref name="mayor-cheyenne-211" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

* The [[Sioux]] people of South Dakota believed that in the first creatures in [[creation myth|creation]] were the [[insects]] and [[reptiles]], who were ruled by the Water Monster Unktehi. Reptiles were very diverse and came in all shapes and sizes, but they became violent and bloodthirsty until they were [[petrified]] by [[lightning]] sent by the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunder Birds]]. The physical bodies of the Thunder Beings killed by the lightning, including Unktehi, also ended up being buried. The Sioux believe that earth has a history of four distinct ages. These events occurred during the Age of Rock. This portrayal of the Thunder Birds may also have been influenced by associations of fossils of ''[[Pteranodon]]'' with marine reptiles of the same age in the [[western United States]].&lt;ref name="mayor-high-221" /&gt;

* In contrast to Cuvier and Blumenbach, [[Samuel Thomas von Soemmering]] interpreted Collini's fossil as a [[mammal]].&lt;ref name=wellnhofer-2008-soemmering-8-9 /&gt; Specifically, he interpreted it as an unusual bat, which morphologically linked mammals with birds. He named this strange creature ''[[Pterodactylus|Ornithocephalus]]''. Soemmering may have interpreted this series of forms in an evolutionary sense, following the [[History of evolutionary thought|early evolutionary ideas]] of [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]]. Soemmering's analysis of the specimen was blemished by anatomical errors, like the misidentifications of bones. Soemmering agreed with Cuvier that the creature was a flying insectivore, however.&lt;ref name=wellnhofer-2008-early-9 /&gt; Soemmering argued that pterosaurs walked on all fours like bats when on the ground.

'''Walter Ernest How''' (25 December 1885 – 5 August 1972) was an Able Seaman who took part in [[Ernest Shackleton|Ernest Shackleton's]] [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] to the South Pole, from 1914-1917. Born in [[Bermondsey]], London, Walter became a sailor at 12 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enduranceobituaries.co.uk/how.htm |title=Endurance Obituaries - Walter Ernest How}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Helen Varey in 1913, and his first daughter was born only six weeks before his departure upon the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]''.

When the Endurance made a stop at [[Buenos Aires]] en route to the Antarctica, How, along with [[William Lincoln Bakewell|Bakewell]], helped smuggle [[Perce Blackborow]] on board as a stowaway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/biography/how_walter.php |title=Cool Antarctica - Walter Ernest How - (1885-1972) - Biographical notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Endurance sank, trapped in the sea ice around Antarctica, How was forced to live upon the icebergs along with the rest of the crew. When they later used the three wooden lifeboats to row to [[Elephant Island]], How was in the ''Stancomb Wills''.

On return to England after their eventual rescue, How was awarded the [[Polar Medal]], and joined the Merchant Navy during the War.

How died of cancer on the 5 August 1972 aged 86.
