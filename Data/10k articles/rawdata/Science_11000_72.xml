'''Alasdair Antony Kenneth White''' (born May 24, 1952) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] management theorist best known for his work on [[performance management]] from a behavioural perspective and in the field of deconcentrated and networked organizations.  Along with John Fairhurst, White developed the White-Fairhurst Performance Hypothesis relating to the performance life-cycle. He is also the author of ''Continuous Quality Improvement'' and ''The Essential Guide to Developing Your Staff''.

==Research==
In 2006, he worked closely with John Fairhurst and, following various observational studies, they formulated the White-Fairhurst Performance Hypothesis which states that "all performance will initially trend towards a steady state, particularly after a period of performance uplift, and that steady state will then develop a downward curve leading to a significant performance decline".

[[File:White-Fairhurst TPR Model.jpg|thumb|250px|right|White-Fairhurst TPR Model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pm-solutions.com/ComfortZone_Performance.html |title=From Comfort Zone to Performance Management |last=Alasdair |first=White |date=November 2009 |publisher=Performance Management Solutions |accessdate=29 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421085837/http://www.pm-solutions.com/ComfortZone_Performance.html |archivedate=21 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In a paper entitled ''From Comfort Zone to Performance Management'', White examines the hypothesis from a theoretical perspective starting with the [[Comfort Zone Theory]] and the work of [[Robert Yerkes]] and John Dodson, David McClelland et al., the [[Tuckman Model]] and Colin Carnall. This theoretical examination leads White to conclude that the White-Fairhurst Hypothesis broadly holds true and the performance curve is as demonstrated in the White-Fairhurst TPR Life-cycle Model (TPR stands for Transforming, Performing, Reforming). There has been some criticism of White’s approach, suggesting that more recent sources and work would have been more appropriate, but none have been able to offer a counter-argument or to adequately refute or dispute the hypothesis. The fact remains that most of the fundamentals of performance behaviour were established in the last century and that the more recent work is itself based on this earlier work.

White argues that what is important now is to determine trend-change points on the performance curve so that the most appropriate performance management actions can be applied. He conducted research within a university environment in this relation to this and the result is recorded in his 2008 essay ''Managing Academic Performance'' the underlying theory of which underpins the approach being adopted by a number of academic institutions.

==Writing==
In addition to writing on management issues, White is also active in writing and editing fiction for White &amp; MacLean Publishing. Among those writings include the a political and action novel ''Shadows'', written under the pen-name of Alex Hunter.

'''''Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure''''' is a 2008 book by [[Paul Offit]], a vaccine expert and chief of infectious diseases at [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]]. The book focuses on the [[vaccine controversy|controversy]] surrounding the now discredited link between [[vaccine]]s and [[autism]]. The current [[scientific consensus]] is that no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims,&lt;ref name=IOM2004&gt;{{cite book|authors=Immunization Safety Review Committee, Board on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, [[Institute of Medicine]]|title=Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines and Autism|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC|year=2004|isbn=0-309-09237-X|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10997.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Doja&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Can J Neurol Sci|year=2006|volume=33|issue=4|pages=341–6|title=Immunizations and autism: a review of the literature|vauthors=Doja A, Roberts W |pmid=17168158|doi=10.1017/s031716710000528x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2011 journal article described the vaccine-autism connection as "the most damaging [[Scientific misconduct|medical hoax]] of the last 100 years".&lt;ref name=Klaherty&gt;{{cite journal|author=Flaherty DK|title=The Vaccine-autism Connection: A Public Health Crisis Caused by Unethical Medical Practices and Fraudulent Science|journal=Ann Pharmacother|volume=45|issue=10|pages=1302–4|date=October 2011|pmid=21917556|doi=10.1345/aph.1Q318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
Offit describes the origins and development of claims regarding the [[MMR vaccine]] and the vaccine preservative [[thiomersal]], as well as subsequent [[scientific evidence]] which has disproved a link with autism. The book discusses possible explanations for the persistence of these claims in the face of scientific evidence to the contrary, as well as the proliferation of potentially risky and unproven [[treatments for autism]].&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[New York Post]] | title = Autism's False Prophets: A Shot of Truth | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/09142008/postopinion/postopbooks/autisms_false_prophets_128960.htm | last = Goldberg | first = Robert | date = 2008-09-14 | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author takes a critical view of several advocates of a vaccine–autism link, including [[Andrew Wakefield]], [[David Kirby (journalist)|David Kirby]], [[Mark Geier]], and [[Boyd Haley]], raising scientific and, in some cases, ethical and legal concerns. The book also explores divisions within the autism community on the topic of vaccines, as some parents consider the ongoing narrow focus on vaccines a distraction from more scientifically promising avenues of research. In this vein, Offit interviews [[Kathleen Seidel]], a mother of an autistic child who has published investigations critical of those who profit from promoting vaccine–autism claims.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;

Offit also touches on the heated and bitter debate surrounding vaccine claims. He describes receiving death threats, [[hate mail]], and threats against his children as a result of his advocacy for vaccination. Offit declined to do a book tour for ''Autism's False Prophets'', citing concerns about his physical safety and comparing the intensity of hatred and threats directed at him to that experienced by [[abortion]] providers.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Newsweek]] | title = Stomping through a medical minefield | url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/165644 | last = Kalb | first = Claudia | date = 2008-11-03 | accessdate = 2008-11-13 |volume=152 |issue=18 |pages=62–3 |pmid=18998447| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081119180127/http://www.newsweek.com/id/165644| archivedate= 19 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author's [[royalties]] from the book are being donated to the Center for Autism Research at [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="royalties"&gt;{{cite press release| publisher =[[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]] | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Author-Royalties-From-Autism-Book/story.aspx?guid=%7BAF9CAF86-F7AE-49D4-A777-AFCCE0B25381%7D | title = Author Royalties From Autism Book Donated to Autism Research | date = 2008-11-03 | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The book was the nucleus of profiles of Offit in ''[[Newsweek]]''&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; and ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.&lt;ref name="inquirer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20080917_Expert_sees_no_link_between_vaccines_and_autism.html |last=Avril |first=Tom |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2008-10-02 |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |title=Expert sees no link between vaccines and autism |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920003656/http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20080917_Expert_sees_no_link_between_vaccines_and_autism.html |archivedate=20 September 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Post]]'' reviewed the book positively, concluding: "Although arguably the most courageous and most knowledgeable scientist about vaccines in the United States, Offit lives in fear for his life and that of his family."&lt;ref name="nypost"/&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' also praised the book as "an invaluable chronicle that relates some of the many ways in which the vulnerabilities of anxious parents have been exploited."&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |last=Seebach |first=Linda |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122212979072465559 |title=Charlatans to the Rescue |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2008-11-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101044217/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122212979072465559.html |archivedate=1 November 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' wrote that the book "names names and calls nonsense nonsense", and provides "important insight into the fatal flaws of the key arguments of vaccine alarmists." The ''Inquirer'' applauded Offit's focus on slanted and sensationalist media coverage of the vaccine–autism issue, but faulted Offit for not holding scientists themselves sufficiently accountable for their failure to communicate the facts to the public.&lt;ref name="pi-review"&gt;{{cite news | work = The Philadelphia Inquirer | last = Collins | first = Huntly | url = http://www.philly.com/inquirer/entertainment/books/20080921_Defending_vaccines_in_the_autism_debate.html | title = Defending vaccines in the autism debate | date = 2008-09-21 | accessdate = 2008-11-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081002021332/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/entertainment/books/20080921_Defending_vaccines_in_the_autism_debate.html| archivedate= 2 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' noted that the book "turned the tables" on those who see a pharmaceutical-industry conspiracy behind vaccination, by pointing out that the advocates of the autism–vaccine link receive large sums of money from lawyers and [[lobbyist]]s. The ''News'' applauded the book's deconstruction of "misinformation" from [[Don Imus]], [[Jenny McCarthy]], [[Joseph Lieberman]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]], among others, but found Offit's "sarcasm and brow-beating of those he disagrees with" to be "grating".&lt;ref name="rmn"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Rocky Mountain News]] | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/02/autisms-false-prophets-bad-science-risky-and-the/ | title = Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure | last = Ruskin | first = Steve | date = 2008-10-02 | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' reviewed the book as an "enlightening, highly readable, and ... timely" work which "deconstruct[s] the anti-vaccine movement as one driven by bad science, litigious greed, hype and ego."&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Salon.com|Salon]] |last=Parikh |first=Rahul |url=http://www.salon.com/books/review/2008/09/22/autism/index.html |title=Inside the vaccine-and-autism scare |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2008-11-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029001252/http://www.salon.com/books/review/2008/09/22/autism/index.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Salon'' faulted Offit for minimizing the work that autism advocacy groups have done to raise awareness, create support networks, and obtain research funding; the review noted that Offit focuses instead on aggressive and scientifically "slanted" groups like [[Defeat Autism Now!]] and [[Generation Rescue]]. The review concluded that the book "effectively pulls back the curtain on the anti-vaccine movement to reveal a crusade grounded less in fact and more in greed and opportunism".&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;

''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' called the book "forceful" and "an easy-to-read medical thriller about the consequences of greed, hubris, and intellectual sloppiness."&lt;ref name=Lord&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=2008-12-12 |volume=322 |issue=5908 |pages=1635–6 |title= Yes We Can! Choose Science in Autism |last=Lord |first=Catherine |doi=10.1126/science.1167173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review noted that Offit did not discuss the irrationality of human decision-making in the presence of relative risk and both anecdotal and empirical evidence, and mentioned that Offit did not carefully discuss the role of regression. In conclusion, the review observed that the book has emboldened the media to apply scientific principles, and called for using the book's momentum to shift resources from the autism–vaccination debate to research into causes and treatments.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

The ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders'' said the book "makes an important contribution to popular debates about the etiology and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. The book is arguably the most detailed and thorough history available of the current anti-vaccine movement". The review noted one possible weakness: the book gives light coverage to the public's fundamental misunderstanding of the [[epidemiology of autism]], in that the public fears an "autism epidemic" that may not in fact be occurring. The review concluded with a call to scientists and physicians to follow Offit's lead in communicating to the public even uncomfortable truths about autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2009 |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=544–6 |title= Offit Paul: ''Autism’s False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure'' |author= Grinker, Roy Richard |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0679-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four months after its release, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the book had been endorsed widely by pediatricians, autism researchers, vaccine companies, and medical journalists, and was "galvanizing a backlash against the antivaccine movement in the United States." Many doctors are critical of "false equivalence" in media coverage of the vaccine issue, and now argue that reporters should treat the antivaccine lobby with the same level of indifference as [[AIDS denialism]] and other fringe theories.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |last=McNeil |first= Donald G., Jr. |title= Book Is Rallying Resistance to the Antivaccine Crusade |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/health/13auti.html |work= [[The New York Times]] |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2009-01-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090402061935/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/health/13auti.html| archivedate=April 2, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2009, the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reported that the book effectively advocated for vaccines and refuted the vaccine–autism myth. It noted that a particular strength of the book is its outline of the scientific method and the basic principles of probability and causality, and its coverage of the difficulty of explaining science to the public, such as the difference between causality and coincidence. It noted as a weakness the book's several diversions into topics such as breast implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |year=2009 |volume=360 |issue=11 |pages=1159–60 |title=Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure|author=Edwards, Kathryn M. |doi=10.1056/NEJMbkrev0809168 |last2=Modjarrad |first2=K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a guest column for ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', neurologist [[Jon Poling]] panned Offit's book as "a novel of perceived good and evil". Poling, whose daughter was federally compensated for vaccine injuries, criticized Offit for attacking those with whom he disagrees: "In the story, Offit takes no prisoners, smearing characters in the vaccine-autism controversy as effortlessly as a rich cream cheese."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/stories/2009/03/13/polinged_0313.html |title=Blinders won't reduce autism |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=March 13, 2009 |accessdate=November 3, 2015 |first=Jon |last=Poling |authorlink=Jon Poling |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129114510/http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/stories/2009/03/13/polinged_0313.html |archivedate=November 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental principle of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] is the stated harmony of religion and science.  Whilst [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í scripture]] asserts that true [[science]] and true [[religion]] can never be in conflict, critics argue that statements by the founders clearly contradict current scientific understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Various |authorlink=Universal House of Justice |title=Letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice |date=1975-12-26 |origyear=1912 |url=http://www.reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/SCH/sch-49.html#gr1 |accessdate=2007-12-01 |publication-date=December 1995 |publisher=Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, Bahá’í World Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Basiti|last2=Moradi|last3=Akhoondali|title=Twelve Principles: A Comprehensive Investigation on the Baha'i Teachings|edition=1st|publisher=Bahar Afshan Publications|location=Tehran|date=2014||page=160|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, stated that "when a religion is opposed to science it becomes mere superstition".&lt;ref name="pt"&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|pp=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PT/pt-45.html 141–146]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that true religion must conform to the conclusions of science.&lt;ref name="pup"&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jbs"&gt;{{harvnb|Mehanian|Friberg|2003|url=http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/13.14%2520Mehanian%2520%26%2520Friberg.pdf&amp;pli=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This latter aspect of the principle seems to suggest that the religion must always accept current scientific knowledge as authoritative, but some Bahá'í scholars have suggested that this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;"It also requires us not to limit science to any particular school of thought or methodological approach postulated in the course of its development." in {{cite web |author=Universal House of Justice |title=19 May 1995 letter, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer (published in Memorandum on Quotations on Science and Religion |date=1997-08-13 |accessdate=2007-12-02 |url=http://bahai-library.com/compilation_science_technology.html#14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On some issues, the Bahá'í Faith subordinates the conclusions of current scientific thought to its own teachings, which the religion takes as fundamentally true.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because, in the Bahá'í understanding the present scientific view is not always correct, neither is truth said to be only limited to what science can explain.&lt;ref name="jbs" /&gt; Instead, in the Bahá'í view, knowledge must be obtained through the interaction of the insights obtained from revelation from God and through scientific investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Universal House of Justice |title=19 May 1995 letter, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer (published in Memorandum on Quotations on Science and Religion |date=1997-08-13 |accessdate=2007-12-02 |url=http://bahai-library.com/compilation_science_technology.html#14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harmony between science and religion==

[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, asserted that science and religion cannot be opposed because they are aspects of the same truth; he also affirmed that reasoning powers are required to understand the truths of religion. [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, described science and religion as "the two most potent forces in human life".&lt;ref name="wob"&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teachings state that whenever conflict arises between religion and science it is due to human error; either through misinterpretation of religious scriptures or the lack of a more complete understanding of science. `Abdu'l-Bahá explained that religious teachings which are at variance with science should not be accepted; he explained that religion has to be reasonable since God endowed humankind with reason so that they can discover truth.&lt;ref name="pup" /&gt;
Science and religion, in the Bahá'í writings, are compared to the two wings of a bird upon which a person's intelligence can increase, and upon which a person's soul can progress.  Furthermore, the Bahá'í writings state that science without religion would lead to a person becoming totally materialistic, and religion without science would lead to a person falling into superstitious practices. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] in one of his public talks said:

{{quote|If religion were contrary to logical reason then it would cease to be a religion and be merely a tradition. Religion and science are the two wings upon which man's intelligence can soar into the heights, with which the human soul can progress. It is not possible to fly with one wing alone! Should a man try to fly with the wing of religion alone he would quickly fall into the quagmire of superstition, whilst on the other hand, with the wing of science alone he would also make no progress, but fall into the despairing slough of materialism. All religions of the present day have fallen into superstitious practices, out of harmony alike with the true principles of the teaching they represent and with the scientific discoveries of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Attitude toward science==
`Abdu'l-Bahá is quoted as saying this:

{{quote|Mathematicians, astronomers, chemical scientists continually disprove and reject the conclusions of the ancients; nothing is fixed, nothing final; everything is continually changing because human reason is progressing along new roads of investigation and arriving at new conclusions every day. In the future much that is announced and accepted as true now will be rejected and disproved. And so it will continue ad infinitum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Scientific claims by the founders==

===Creation===

Bahá’u’lláh taught that the universe has "neither beginning nor ending",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-79.html#gr8 220]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the component elements of the material world have always existed and will continue to exist.&lt;ref name="creation"&gt;{{harvnb|Esslemont|1980|pp=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/o/BNE/bne-163.html 204–205]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas|Tablet of Wisdom]]'' (''"Lawh-i-Hikmat"'', written 1873-1874). Bahá'u'lláh states: "That which hath been in existence had existed before, but not in the form thou seest today. The world of existence came into being through the heat generated from the interaction between the active force and that which is its recipient. These two are the same, yet they are different." The terminology used here refers to [[ancient Greek]] and [[Islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taherzadeh |first=A. |author-link = Adib Taherzadeh |year=1987 |title=The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 4: Mazra'ih &amp; Bahji 1877-92 |publisher=George Ronald |place=Oxford, UK |isbn=0-85398-270-8 |pages=42 |url=http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V4/Cover.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Marc Lepain, Robin Mihrshahi, Dale E.

Bahá'ís believe that the story of creation in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] is a rudimentary account that conveys the broad essential spiritual truths of existence without a level of detail and accuracy that was unnecessary and incomprehensible at the time.&lt;ref name="creation" /&gt; Likewise, `Abdu'l-Bahá said that literal story of [[Adam and Eve]] cannot be accepted, affirmed, or imagined, and that it "must be thought of simply as a symbol".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; And rather than accepting the idea of a [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth]], Bahá'í theology accepts that the Earth is ancient.&lt;ref name="brown-evo"&gt;{{Cite book | editor-last = Brown  | editor-first = Keven  | editor2-last = Von Kitzing  | editor2-first =Eberhard |last= |first= |last2= |first2=| author2-link = |title=Evolution and Bahá'í belief: ʻAbduʾl-Bahá's response to nineteenth-century Darwinism; Volume 12 of Studies in the Bábí and Bahá'í religions |publisher=Kalimat Press |year=2001 |location= |pages=6, 17, 117, etc. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=egDAfpkONRsC |isbn=978-1-890688-08-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
[[File:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Charles Darwin]], the famous 19th-century English naturalist who proposed a naturalistic mechanism for evolution.]]
In regards to [[evolution]] and the origin of man, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] gave extensive comments on the subject when he addressed western audiences in the beginning of the 20th century. Transcripts of these talks can be found in ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'', ''[[Paris Talks]]'' and the ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/ Promulgation of Universal Peace]''.  `Abdu'l-Bahá describes the human species as evolving from a primitive form to modern man, but that the capacity to form human intelligence was always in existence.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

`Abdu'l-Bahá's comments seem to differ from the standard evolutionary picture of human development, where [[Homo sapiens]] as one species along with the great apes [[Single-origin hypothesis|evolved from a common ancestor]] living in Africa millions of years ago. 

While `Abdu'l-Bahá states that man progressed through many stages before reaching this present form, `Abdu'l-Bahá states that humans are a distinct species, and not an [[animal]], and that in every stage of evolution through which humans progressed, they were ''potentially'' humans.

{{quote|But at all times, even when the embryo resembled a worm, it was human in potentiality and character, not animal. The forms assumed by the human embryo in its successive changes do not prove that it is animal in its essential character. Throughout this progression there has been transference of type, a conservation of species or kind. Realizing this we may acknowledge the fact that at one time man was an inmate of the sea, at another period an [[invertebrate]], then a [[vertebrate]] and finally a human being standing erect. Though we admit these changes, we cannot say man is an animal. In each one of these stages are signs and evidences of his human existence and destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mehanian and Friberg wrote a 2003 article describing their belief that `Abdu'l-Bahá's statements can be entirely reconciled with modern science. Mehanian and Friberg state that `Abdu'l-Bahá's departures from the conventional interpretation of evolution are likely due "to disagreements with the metaphysical, philosophical, and ideological aspects of those interpretations, not with scientific findings."&lt;ref name="jbs" /&gt; And to this end `Abdu'l-Bahá suggested that a [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]] between human and apes would not be found.&lt;ref name="matthews"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Matthews |first=Gary L. |title=The Challenge of Baha'u'llah |publisher=US Baha'i Publishing Trust |year=2005 |pages=90–5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGbZMLCmE1IC&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q |isbn=978-1-931847-16-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a missing link per se was abandoned by science in favor of the idea of evolutionary transitions.&lt;ref name = "NS2645"&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=2008-02-27 |issue=2645 |pages=35–40 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726451.700-evolution-what-missing-link.html?full=true |title=Evolution: What missing link? |first=D |last=Prothero |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nomorelink"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/04/08/tech-fossil-human-ancestor.html |title=Newly found fossils could link to human ancestor |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-08 |quote=It's tempting to call the new species a "missing link" between earlier species and modern humans, but scientists say the concept no longer applies, given new knowledge of human evolution. ...

There are some differences between `Abdu'l-Bahá's statements and current scientific thought.  The Bahá’í perspective that religion must be in accordance with science seems to suggest that religion must accept current scientific knowledge as authoritative; but, according to Mehanian and Friberg, this is not necessarily always the case as in their view the present scientific point of view is not always correct, nor truth only limited to what science can explain.&lt;ref name="jbs" /&gt;

Oskooi chose the subject of evolution and Bahá'í belief for his 2009 thesis, and in doing so reviewed other Bahá'í authors' works on the subject. He concluded that, "The problem of disharmony between scripture and science is rooted in an unwarranted misattribution of scriptural inerrancy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bahai-library.com/oskooi_disharmony_science_religion |title=When Science and Religion Merge |publisher=Bahai-library.com |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, he believes that `Abdu'l-Bahá made statements about biology that were later proved wrong, and that `Abdu'l-Bahá's infallibility should not be applied to scientific matters.

Several authors have written on the subject of evolution and Bahá'í belief.

===Existence of ether===
[[File:AetherWind.svg|thumb|327px|The luminiferous aether: it was hypothesised that the Earth moves through a "medium" of aether that carries light]]
[[Luminiferous aether|Aether]], or ether, was a substance postulated in the late 19th century to be the medium for the propagation of light. The [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] of 1887 made an effort to find the aether, but its failure to detect it led [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to devise his [[Special Relativity|Special theory of Relativity]]. Further developments in modern physics, including [[General Relativity]], [[Quantum Field Theory]], and [[String Theory]] all incorporate the non-existence of the aether, and today the concept is considered obsolete scientific theory.

`Abdu'l-Bahá's use of the aether concept in one of his talks - his audience including scientists of the time - has been the source of some controversy. The chapter in `Abdu'l-Bahá's ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'' which mentions aether differentiates between things that are "perceptible to the senses" and those which are "realities of the intellect" and not perceptible to the senses.&lt;ref name="house_letter"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/uhj_infallibility_abdulbaha Letter] to an individual by the [[Universal House of Justice]]&lt;/ref&gt;  `Abdu'l-Bahá includes "ethereal matter" (also translated as "etheric matter"), heat, light and electricity among other things, in the second group of things which are not perceptible to the senses, and are concepts which are arrived at intellectually to explain certain phenomena.&lt;ref name="house_letter" /&gt; The [[Universal House of Justice]] referring to `Abdu'l-Bahá's use of the word state that, "in due course, when scientists failed to confirm the physical existence of the 'ether' by delicate experiments, they constructed other intellectual concepts to explain the same phenomena" which is consistent with `Abdu'l-Bahá's categorization of aether.&lt;ref name="house_letter" /&gt;

Robin Mishrahi in his published paper on the issue titled "''Ether, Quantum Physics and the Bahá'í Writings''" wrote,

{{quote|As a final observation it should be noted that because many of the scientific discoveries and theories referred to in the Bahá'í Writings were yet unknown to the contemporaries of Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá, They obviously could not have used the technical terms applied for their description nowadays. Instead, They had to make use of and sometimes redefine already existing concepts and terms (e.g. the ether concept or the idea of the four elements of ancient Greek philosophy) in a way that they would accurately explain what They had in mind. On a superficial level, this might give the impression that the [[List of Bahá'ís#Central figures|Central Figures]] of the Faith did not actually formulate any new ideas about physical reality.  When we study Their Writings more closely, however, we come to realise that this only seems to be the case because Their references to such topics were purposely made in such a way that they would neither offend Their addressees who believed in certain (erroneous) contemporary scientific concepts, nor make use of a terminology that had not yet been developed by contemporary scientists."&lt;ref name="mihrshahi_ether"/&gt;}}

===Nuclear power===
Bahá'u'lláh wrote:
{{quote|Strange and astonishing things exist in the earth but they are hidden from the minds and the understanding of men. These things are capable of changing the whole atmosphere of the earth and their contamination would prove lethal."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1994|p=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-7.html#pg69 69]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bahá'ís later pointed to this as a statement about the discovery of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and the use of [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=nuclear power |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |pages=260–261 |isbn=1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmutation of elements===
In 1873 Bahá'u'lláh wrote:
{{quote|Consider the doubts which they who have joined partners with God have instilled into the hearts of the people of this land. "Is it ever possible," they ask, "for copper to be transmuted into gold?" Say, Yes, by my Lord, it is possible. Its secret, however, lieth hidden in Our Knowledge. We will reveal it unto whom We will. Whoso doubteth Our power, let him ask the Lord his God, that He may disclose unto him the secret, and assure him of its truth. That copper can be turned into gold is in itself sufficient proof that gold can, in like manner, be transmuted into copper, if they be of them that can apprehend this truth. Every mineral can be made to acquire the density, form, and substance of each and every other mineral. The knowledge thereof is with Us in the Hidden Book.&lt;ref&gt;Bahá'u'lláh, [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-97.html#pg198 Gleanings from the Writing of, Section XCVII]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Life on other planets===
[[File:Kepler Space Telescope.png|thumb|180px|[[Kepler Mission|Kepler Space Telescope]] - a NASA telescope that is capable of detecting extrasolar terrestrial planets.]]
[[Bahá'u'lláh]] stated:
{{quote|The learned men, [divines] that have fixed at several thousand years the life of this earth, have failed, throughout the long period of their observation, to consider either the number or the age of the other planets. Consider, moreover, the manifold divergencies that have resulted from the theories propounded by these men. '''Know thou that every fixed star hath its own planets, and every planet its own creatures, whose number no man can compute.'''&lt;ref name="gleanings_pg162"&gt;{{harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1990|pp=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-82.html#pg162 162–163]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [Emphasis added]}}

The idea that every planet has "its own creatures" is controversial. While no direct evidence has been found of [[extraterrestrial life]], theories range from the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]], that the earth may be unique in hosting life, to the more common idea that it would be improbable for life ''not'' to exist somewhere other than Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgQj5D524PYC&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Other Worlds, Other Universes |publisher=Health Research Books |editor1-first=Brad |editor1-last=Steiger |editor2-first=John |editor2-last=White |page=3 |date=1986 |isbn=0-7873-1291-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Filkin |first2=Stephen W. |last2=Hawking |title=Stephen Hawking's universe: the cosmos explained |page=194 |series=Art of Mentoring Series |publisher=Basic Books |year=1998 |isbn=0-465-08198-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=95Kog5v4ZxkC&amp;pg=PA194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few Bahá'í sources deal with this idea in detail. Shoghi Effendi wrote in a letter,
{{quote|...the creatures which Bahá'u'lláh states to be found in every planet cannot be considered to be necessarily similar or different from human beings on this earth. Bahá'u'lláh does not specifically state whether such creatures are like or unlike us. He simply refers to the fact that there are creatures in every planet. It remains for science to discover one day the exact nature of these creatures.&lt;ref name="guardian_interp"&gt;{{harvnb|Hornby|1994|p=478 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the same subject, the [[Universal House of Justice]] wrote,
{{quote|As you rightly state, Bahá'u'lláh affirms that every fixed star has its planets, and every planet its own creatures. The House of Justice states however, that it has not discovered anything in the Bahá'í Writings which would indicate the degree of progress such creatures may have attained.&lt;ref name="house_etlife"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sabeans, UFOs, Alien Abduction and Genetic Engineering |author=Universal House of Justice |authorlink=Universal House of Justice |accessdate=2006-05-20 |date=1996-08-06 |url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_sabeans_mary_ufos}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Behavior Genetics Association''' ('''BGA''') is a [[learned society]] established in 1970 and which promotes research into the connections between [[heredity]] and [[behavior]], both human and animal. Its members support education and training in [[Behavioural genetics|behavior genetics]]; and aid in the [[Behavior Genetics (journal)|dissemination]] of  knowledge concerning genetics and behavior, and its implications, such as in health.

== Aims ==
The association's goal is "to promote scientific study of the interrelationship of genetic mechanisms and behavior, both human and animal; to encourage and aid the education and training of research workers in the field of behavior genetics; and to aid in the dissemination and interpretation to the general public of knowledge concerning the interrelationship of genetics and behavior, and its implications for health and human development and education." To help attain these goals, the society organizes an annual meeting and publishes its official  [[scientific journal]] entitled ''[[Behavior Genetics (journal)|Behavior Genetics]]''.&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bga.org/pages/1/Home.html |title=Home |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718080427/http://www.bga.org/pages/1/Home.html |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 12 annual meetings were held in different places within the United States. In 1983, the association held its first annual meeting in Europe (London) and since then meetings have been held in Australia, Canada, France, Korea, Spain, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as various US states.&lt;ref name=list /&gt;

== Membership ==
The society has three classes of members: Regular consisting of persons who teach or perform research related to [[behavioural genetics|behavioral genetics]], Associate Members – students in good standing at a recognized college or university&lt;ref name=members&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bga.org/pages/17/Apply_for_membership.html |title=Apply for membership |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101131752/http://www.bga.org/pages/17/Apply_for_membership.html |archivedate=2011-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and retired members. Members receive a complimentary subscription to the society's journal as well as discounted registration rates for the association's annual meetings.&lt;ref name=membership&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bga.org/pages/6/Membership.html |title=Membership |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231054944/http://www.bga.org/pages/6/Membership.html |archivedate=2010-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
The society's business are conducted by a [[board of directors]], called the [[Committee#Executive committee|executive committee]].&lt;ref name=bylaws&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bga.org/pages/11/ByLaws.html |title=BGA - By-Laws |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board consists of 9 members: president, president-elect, past-president, secretary, [[treasurer]], an information officer, and three members-at-large (representing the general members, associate members, and members from outside North America).&lt;ref name=ExCom&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bga.org/pages/10/Executive_Committee.html |title=Executive Committee |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225191702/http://www.bga.org/pages/10/Executive_Committee.html |archivedate=2011-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the executive committee serve three-year terms. To ensure continuity, one member-at-large is elected every year.&lt;ref name=ExCom /&gt;

=== Presidents ===
Presidents serve three-year terms. Upon election, they become president-elect and they serve as chair of the program committee for that year.&lt;ref name=ExCom /&gt; After one year they become president and in the third year of their term they serve as past-president.&lt;ref name=bylaws /&gt; The association's first president was [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]].&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bga.org/meetings/historical-table-of-bga-meetings/ |title=Historical table of BGA Meetings |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable presidents include [[Irving Gottesman|Irving I.

== Awards ==
The association gives several yearly awards for accomplishments in the field of behavioral genetics.The [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]] Award, named after its first president, is given for lifetime accomplishments&lt;ref name=list /&gt; and is chosen by the three most recent past presidents.&lt;ref name=bylaws /&gt;  The Fuller &amp; Scott Award is an early career award for accomplishments by researchers that are within seven years of receiving their terminal degree.&lt;ref name=meeting /&gt; The award is named after former presidents [[John L. Fuller]] and [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]] and the award committee is the same as for the Dobzhansky Award.&lt;ref name=bylaws /&gt; The Thompson and Rowe awards, are named after former president [[W. R. Thompson]] (1977), and [[David C. Rowe]], a pioneer of [[Gene–environment interaction|Gene-Environment interaction]] research respectively. The Thompson is given for the oral presentation given by an associate (student) member, and judged as most outstanding during the annual meeting.&lt;ref name=meeting&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bga.org/pages/68/Current_BGA_Meeting.html |title=Current BGA Meeting |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718080204/http://www.bga.org/pages/68/Current_BGA_Meeting.html |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rowe similarly recognises the most outstanding student poster presentation. The awards committee for these awards consists of the past president together with the three members-at-large of the executive committee.&lt;ref name=bylaws /&gt; In addition, the society gives the annual Fulker Award for an outstanding paper published in ''Behavior Genetics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10519-010-9391-8 | title = Awards Presented at the 40th Annual Meeting of the Behavior Genetics Association | journal = Behavior Genetics | volume = 40 | pages = 825–825 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This award is named after former president [[David Fulker]] (1983), who also was a previous [[editor-in-chief]] of the journal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2298">The '''Bermuda Principles''' set out rules for the rapid and public release of [[DNA]] [[sequence database|sequence data]]. The [[Human Genome Project]], a multinational effort to sequence the [[human genome]], generated vast quantities of data about the genetic make-up of humans and other organisms. But, in some respects, even more remarkable than the impressive quantity of data generated by the Human Genome Project is the speed at which that data has been released to the public. At a 1996 summit in [[Bermuda]], leaders of the scientific community agreed on a groundbreaking set of principles requiring that all DNA sequence data be released in publicly accessible databases within twenty-four hours after generation. These "Bermuda Principles" (also known as the "Bermuda Accord") contravened the typical practice in the sciences of making experimental data available only after publication. These principles represent a significant achievement of private ordering in shaping the practices of an entire industry and have established rapid pre-[[Academic publishing|publication]] data release as the norm in [[genomics]] and other fields.

The three principles retained originally were:
* Automatic release of sequence assemblies larger than 1 kb (preferably within 24 hours).
* Immediate publication of finished annotated sequences.
* Aim to make the entire sequence freely available in the public domain for both research and development in order to maximise benefits to society.

'''''Big Picture Science''''' (formerly titled '''''Are We Alone?''''') is the [[SETI Institute]]'s weekly science radio program, hosted by Senior [[Astronomer]] [[Seth Shostak]] and [[Molly Bentley]], the executive producer of the radio show.&lt;ref name="seti"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://radio.seti.org/pages/about_the_show |title=About Big Picture Science |publisher=SETI Institute |date=2014 |accessdate=5 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001041153/http://radio.seti.org/pages/about_the_show |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show covers a broad range of topics in the sciences as they relate to our understanding of the origin and evolution of [[life|life on Earth]], and what [[life]] elsewhere in the [[universe]] might be like. Each week's show has a theme and allows scientists to share their latest findings and speculate on the implications for [[SETI]] (the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) and society in general.
Guests include scientists and researchers from academic, public and private spheres (including [[NASA]]), popular science writers, cultural critics and [[ethicist]]s focused on science. [[Phil Plait]] is a recurring guest, with an own segment called "Brains on Vacation". One show a month is devoted to critical thinking and [[debunker]]s of [[junk science]] and the [[paranormal]]: "Skeptic Check".

The show is broadcast on public radio stations [[KLIV]] in San Jose, [[WCMU-FM]] in Michigan, [[WVPE]] in Indiana, [[WHRV]] in Virginia, [[WIEC]] in Wisconsin as well as [[World FM]] in [[Tawa, Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]. The show is also available for download via [[podcast]] and direct download from the show's website where archived shows from 2006 onwards can also be found.

In May 2011, Executive Producer Molly Bentley announced on the show's blog that its name would be changing to ''Big Picture Science'' in mid-July.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://radio.seti.org/blog/2011/05/the-names-they-are-a-changin |publisher=Are We a Blog? |title=The Names They are a-Changin' |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bringelly Shale''' is a component of the [[Wianamatta shale|Wianammatta group]] of [[sedimentary]] rocks in the [[Sydney Basin]] of eastern [[Australia]]. It was formed in the [[Triassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. It is most often seen in the western parts of the city. The shale has its greatest geographical extent at [[Bringelly]], near the suburb of [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]]. It is similar to [[Ashfield Shale]], though differing in having a greater amount of [[sandstone]] and lacking [[siderite|sideritic]] [[mudstone]] bands. The average thickness is around 60 metres.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web|last=Lovering, J.

'''Carl Heinrich Georg(es) von Heyden''' (20 January 1793 [[Frankfurt]] – 7 July 1866) was a [[Germany|German]] [[senator]] and [[entomologist]]. He collected insects in all [[Order (biology)|Orders]] but was especially interested in [[Coleoptera]], [[Microlepidoptera]], [[Hymenoptera]], [[Diptera]] and [[Prehistoric insects|fossil insects]]. His collections are divided between the [[German Entomological Institute]] and the [[Senckenberg Museum]].

He studied [[forestry]] under [[Johann Matthäus Bechstein]] at the Dreißigacker Forest Academy near [[Meiningen]], then continued his education at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. With his son, Lukas von Heyden, he conducted studies of fossil insects found in [[lignite]]. In addition to his entomological research, he performed investigations of reptile specimens collected by [[Eduard Rüppell]] in [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz32068.html Heyden, Carl von] NDB/ADB Deutsche Biographie&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1817, he was co-founder of the ''Senckenbergischen Naturforschenden Gesellschaft''.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;

'''Ceremonial marriage''' is a common form of [[marriage]] in which a couple follows laws and procedures specified by the state in order to gain recognition of their marriage (ex. buying a [[marriage license]], participating in a ceremony led by an authorized official, having witnesses at a ceremony). They are often accompanied by [[wedding]]s, and have different forms, reflecting particular religious and philosophical views of the couple.

Ceremonial marriage is an opposite to [[common-law marriage]].

'''Chess symbols''' are part of '''Unicode'''. Instead of using [[Digital image|images]], one can represent [[chess piece]]s by symbols that are defined in the [[Unicode]] character set. This makes it possible to:
* Use [[Algebraic notation (chess)#Figurine algebraic notation|figurine algebraic notation]], which replaces the letter that stands for a piece by its symbol, e.g.  '''♘c6''' instead of '''Nc6'''. This enables the moves to be read independent of language (the letter abbreviations of pieces in [[Algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic notation]] vary from language to language).
* Produce the symbols using a [[text editor]] or [[word processor]] rather than a [[graphics editor]].

In order to display or print these symbols, one has to have one or more [[font]]s with good [[Unicode]] support installed on the computer, and the document (Web page, word processor document, etc.) must use one of these fonts.&lt;ref name="alanwoodTestForUnicodeSuportInBrowser"&gt;{{ cite web

 | title=Test for Unicode support in Web browsers
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unicode code points and HTML==
Chess symbols are part of the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block.

'''Cyclops''' was a high-power [[laser]] built at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) in 1975. It was the second laser constructed in the lab's ''Laser'' program, which aimed to study [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The Cyclops was a single-beam [[Neodymium|Neodymium glass]] (Nd:glass) laser. The [[Janus laser]], a two-beam version of it, was also completed in 1975. The main scientific aims of its construction were for the study of nonlinear focusing effects in high power laser beams, novel amplification techniques (disks of Nd:glass at the [[brewster angle]]), [[spatial filtering]] techniques which would be used on subsequent higher powered lasers such as the [[argus laser|Argus]] and [[Shiva laser]]s and for [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) research.

==Background==
Even the earliest ICF laser experiments demonstrated that one of the main problems which needed to be addressed was poor focusing of the beams and damage caused to [[optics]] due to the beam's extreme intensities caused by the [[optical Kerr effect]], where, because the beam is so intense, that during its passage through either air or glass the electric field of the light actually alters the [[index of refraction]] of the material and causes the beam at the most intense points to "self focus" down to filament like structures of extremely high intensity. When a beam collapses into extremely high intensity filaments like this, it can easily exceed the [[optical damage threshold]] of laser glass and other optics, severely damaging them by creating pits, cracks and grey tracks through the glass.
 
This novel problem only became obvious as the lasers were scaled up in power to where nonlinear phenomena occur with very intense beams of light. LLNL's Krupke stated: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If the intensity of the light gets high enough &amp;mdash;as in fusion lasers&amp;mdash; the electric field in the light perturbs the atoms of the glass so strongly that the glass responds in a nonlinear way.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the time there was no strong theoretical understanding of these effects, and predicting them was difficult. However, LLNL researchers combined their own efforts with those of the commercial glass vendors and were able to develop a new predictive tool which explained the relationship between the nonlinear effect intensity to all types of glass. As Krupke noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was like the [[Rosetta stone]]. With this quantitative correspondence, they were able to plot the nonlinear refractive performance of millions of glasses and find the one with the lowest possible value. We then worked with our industrial partners to make a composition with the characteristics we needed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although using the proper glass was able to reduce the problem as much as possible, the problem still existed. For smaller experiments this would not be enough of an effect to worry about, but with the much larger and more powerful Shiva already under design, some way of further improving the beam smoothness of the laser needed to be studied.

The simplest way to eliminate these effects was to filter them out physically using what essentially amounts to a [[Fourier transform]] technique applied to the beam's spaitial intensity profile. Imaging spatial filters are, in effect, small inverted telescopes inserted in the laser beam to focus the light through a pinhole. Many modes of spatial [[anisotropy]] would result in a very low angle of diffraction off the centerline however, so to improve the smoothing performance, the spatial filter tube is extremely long, thereby maximizing the distance the filaments moved from the centerline. Such a laser had not previously been built, the earlier Janus laser, which explored the Nd:glass laser itself, was only a few meters long.

It was precisely the problems of building a long laser that Cyclops was built to study. Cyclops was effectively a single-beam of the larger Shiva design, one that could be completed as quickly as possible in order to identify potential problems and come up with the best arrangement for the filters. In this goal Cyclops was successful, and every major ICF effort since has used the spatial filtering technique, leading to ever-growing laser "beamlines" on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;m today.

While Cyclops was still under construction, another LLNL laser was being built that also incorporated the spatial filtering technique, [[Argus laser|Argus]]. Argus passed its light through a series of amplifiers, with spatial filters between each stage and easily achieved terawatt beam powers.

In [[number theory]], the '''divisor summatory function''' is a function that is a sum over the [[divisor function]]. It frequently occurs in the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. The various studies of the behaviour of the divisor function are sometimes called '''divisor problems'''.

==Definition==
The divisor summatory function is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;D(x)=\sum_{n\le x} d(n) = \sum_{j,k \atop jk\le x} 1&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;d(n)=\sigma_0(n) = \sum_{j,k \atop jk=n} 1&lt;/math&gt; 

is the [[divisor function]]. The divisor function counts the number of ways that the integer ''n'' can be written as a product of two integers. More generally, one defines 

:&lt;math&gt;D_k(x)=\sum_{n\le x} d_k(n)=\sum_{mn\le x} d_{k-1}(n)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') counts the number of ways that ''n'' can be written as a product of ''k'' numbers. This quantity can be visualized as the count of the number of lattice points fenced off by a hyperbolic surface in ''k'' dimensions.  Thus, for ''k''=2, ''D''(''x'') = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') counts the number of points on a square lattice bounded on the left by the vertical-axis, on the bottom by the horizontal-axis, and to the upper-right by the hyperbola ''jk''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''. Roughly, this shape may be envisioned as a hyperbolic [[simplex]]. This allows us to provide an alternative expression for ''D''(''x''), and a simple way to compute it in &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt{x})&lt;/math&gt; time:

:&lt;math&gt;D(x)=\sum_{k=1}^x \left\lfloor\frac{x}{k}\right\rfloor = 2 \sum_{k=1}^u \left\lfloor\frac{x}{k}\right\rfloor - u^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u = \left\lfloor \sqrt{x}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

If the hyperbola in this context is replaced by a circle then determining the value of the resulting function is known as the [[Gauss circle problem]].

Sequence of D(n){{OEIS|A006218}}:&lt;br/&gt;
0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 45, 50, 52, 58, 60, 66, 70, 74, 76, 84, 87, 91, 95, 101, 103, 111, ...

==Dirichlet's divisor problem==
Finding a closed form for this summed expression seems to be beyond the techniques available, but it is possible to give approximations. The leading behaviour of the series is not difficult to obtain. [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] demonstrated that

:&lt;math&gt;D(x) = x\log x + x(2\gamma-1) + \Delta(x)\ &lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]], and the non-leading term is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(x) = O\left(\sqrt{x}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[Big-O notation]]. The '''Dirichlet divisor problem''', precisely stated, is to find the smallest value of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; for which 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(x) = O\left(x^{\theta+\epsilon}\right)&lt;/math&gt; 

holds true, for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  As of today, this problem remains unsolved. Progress has been slow. Many of the same methods work for this problem and for [[Gauss's circle problem]], another lattice-point counting problem.  Section F1 of ''Unsolved Problems in Number Theory''

*In 2003, [[Martin Huxley|M.N.

So, &lt;math&gt;\inf \theta&lt;/math&gt; lies somewhere between 1/4 and 131/416 (approx. 0.3149); it is widely conjectured to be 1/4.  Theoretical evidence lends credence to this conjecture, since &lt;math&gt;\Delta(x)/x^{1/4}&lt;/math&gt; has a (non-Gaussian) limiting distribution.{{cn|date=March 2018}}  The value of 1/4 would also follow from a conjecture on [[exponent pairs]].&lt;ref name=Mon59&gt;{{cite book | last=Montgomery | first=Hugh L. | author-link=Hugh Montgomery (mathematician) | title=Ten lectures on the interface between analytic number theory and harmonic analysis | series=Regional Conference Series in Mathematics | volume=84 | location=Providence, RI | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=1994 | isbn=0-8218-0737-4 | zbl=0814.11001 | page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Piltz divisor problem==
In the generalized case, one has

:&lt;math&gt;D_k(x) = xP_k(\log x)+\Delta_k(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_k&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Degree of a polynomial|polynomial of degree]] &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt;. Using simple estimates, it is readily shown that 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_k(x)=O\left( x^{1-1/k} \log^{k-2} x\right)&lt;/math&gt;

for integer &lt;math&gt;k\ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. As in the &lt;math&gt;k=2&lt;/math&gt; case, the infimum of the bound is not known for any value of &lt;math&gt; k&lt;/math&gt;. Computing these infima is known as the Piltz divisor problem, after the name of the German mathematician [[Adolf Piltz]] (also see his German page).  Defining the order &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; as the smallest value for which &lt;math&gt;\Delta_k(x)=O\left( x^{\alpha_k+\varepsilon}\right)&lt;/math&gt; holds, for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, one has the following results (note that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; of the previous section):

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2\le\frac{131}{416}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt;

==Mellin transform==
Both portions may be expressed as [[Mellin transform]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;D(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} 
\zeta^2(w) \frac {x^w}{w}\, dw&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;c&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann zeta function]]. Similarly, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c^\prime-i\infty}^{c^\prime+i\infty} 
\zeta^2(w) \frac {x^w}{w} \,dw&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;c^\prime&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The leading term of &lt;math&gt;D(x)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by shifting the contour past the double pole at &lt;math&gt;w=1&lt;/math&gt;: the leading term is just the [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]], by [[Cauchy's integral formula]].  In general, one has 

:&lt;math&gt;D_k(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} 
\zeta^k(w) \frac {x^w}{w} \,dw&lt;/math&gt;

and likewise for &lt;math&gt;\Delta_k(x)&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;k\ge 2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Virology==
The virion particle is between 80-100&amp;nbsp;nm and consists of an enveloped [[ribonucleocapsid]] that exhibits helical symmetry. The genomes are segmented, consisting of four strands of [[Negative-sense ssRNA virus|negative-sense single-stranded RNA]].

==Taxonomy==
Emaravirus has the closest phylogenetic relationship with members of the genera ''[[Tospovirus]]'' and ''[[Orthobunyavirus]]''. The 3' and 5' ends of the genomic RNAs are complementary (similar to viruses of the [[Bunyaviridae]] family), with the sequence 5'-AGUAGUGUUCUCC-3' at the 5' terminus and 5'-GGAGUUCACUACU-3' at the 3' terminus. However, the number of genome segments and gene sequences distinguishes emaraviruses from bunyaviruses and [[tenuivirus]]es.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9120">In [[mathematics]], '''fuzzy measure theory''' considers generalized [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s in which the additive property is replaced by the weaker property of monotonicity.  The central concept of fuzzy measure theory is the fuzzy measure (also ''capacity'', see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author         = Gustave Choquet
|author-link         = Gustave Choquet
|title          = Theory of Capacities
|journal        = Annales de l'Institut Fourier
|volume         = 5
|pages          = 131–295
|year           = 1953
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which was introduced by [[Gustave Choquet|Choquet]] in 1953 and independently defined by Sugeno in 1974 in the context of [[Sugeno integral|fuzzy integrals]].  There exists a number of different classes of fuzzy measures including [[Dempster-Shafer theory|plausibility/belief]] measures; [[Possibility theory|possibility/necessity]] measures; and [[probability measure|probability]] measures which are a subset of [[measure (mathematics)|classical]] measures.

==Definitions==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[universe of discourse]], &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Class (mathematics)|class]] of [[subset]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E,F\in\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.  A [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;g:\mathcal{C}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where

# &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \in \mathcal{C} \Rightarrow g(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;E \subseteq F \Rightarrow g(E)\leq g(F)&lt;/math&gt;

is called a ''fuzzy measure''. 
A fuzzy measure is called ''normalized'' or ''regular'' if &lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{X})=1&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--
Adding some examples of fuzzy measures--&gt;

==Properties of fuzzy measures==

For any &lt;math&gt; E,F \in \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, a fuzzy measure is:

* '''additive''' if  &lt;math&gt; g(E \cup F) = g(E) + g(F). &lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt;  E \cap F = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt;;
* '''supermodular''' if &lt;math&gt;g(E \cup F) + g(E \cap F) \geq g(E) + g(F)&lt;/math&gt;;
*  '''[[submodular]]''' if  &lt;math&gt;g(E \cup F) + g(E \cap F) \leq g(E) + g(F)&lt;/math&gt;;
*  '''superadditive''' if  &lt;math&gt;g(E \cup F) \geq g(E) + g(F)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;E \cap F = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;;
*  '''subadditive''' if  &lt;math&gt;g(E \cup F) \leq g(E) + g(F)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;E \cap F = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;;
*  '''symmetric''' if &lt;math&gt;|E| = |F|&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; g(E) = g(F)&lt;/math&gt;;
*  '''Boolean''' if &lt;math&gt; g(E) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; g(E) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Understanding the properties of fuzzy measures is useful in application.  When a fuzzy measure is used to define a function such as the [[Sugeno integral]] or [[Choquet integral]], these properties will be crucial in understanding the function's behavior.  For instance, the Choquet integral with respect to an additive fuzzy measure reduces to the [[Lebesgue integral]].  In discrete cases, a symmetric fuzzy measure will result in the [[Ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator|ordered weighted averaging]] (OWA) operator.  Submodular fuzzy measures result in convex functions, while supermodular fuzzy measures result in concave functions when used to define a Choquet integral.

==Möbius representation==
Let ''g'' be a fuzzy measure, the Möbius representation of ''g'' is given by the set function ''M'', where for every &lt;math&gt; E,F \subseteq X &lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt;M(E) = \sum_{F \subseteq E} (-1)^{|E \backslash F|} g(F).&lt;/math&gt;
The equivalent axioms in Möbius representation are:

# &lt;math&gt; M(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt; \sum_{F \subseteq E|i \in F} M(F) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt; i \in E &lt;/math&gt;

A fuzzy measure in Möbius representation  ''M'' is called ''normalized''
if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{E \subseteq \mathbf{X}}M(E)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

Möbius representation can be used to give an indication of which subsets of '''X''' interact with one another.  For instance, an additive fuzzy measure has Möbius values all equal to zero except for singletons.    The fuzzy measure ''g'' in standard representation can be recovered from the Möbius form using the Zeta transform:

:&lt;math&gt;  g(E) = \sum_{F \subseteq E} M(F), \forall E \subseteq \mathbf{X} .&lt;/math&gt;

==Simplification assumptions for fuzzy measures==

Fuzzy measures are defined on a [[semiring|semiring of sets]] or [[monotone class]] which may be as granular as the [[power set]] of '''X''', and even in discrete cases the number of variables can as large as 2&lt;sup&gt;|'''X'''|&lt;/sup&gt;.  For this reason, in the context of [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] and other disciplines, simplification assumptions on the fuzzy measure have been introduced so that it is less computationally expensive to determine and use.  For instance, when it is assumed the fuzzy measure is ''additive'', it will hold that &lt;math&gt; g(E) = \sum_{i \in E} g(\{i\}) &lt;/math&gt; and the values of the fuzzy measure can be evaluated from the values on '''X'''.  Similarly, a ''symmetric'' fuzzy measure is defined uniquely by |'''X'''| values.  Two important fuzzy measures that can be used are the Sugeno- or &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-fuzzy measure and ''k''-additive measures, introduced by Sugeno&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

===Sugeno ''&amp;lambda;''-measure===

The Sugeno &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-measure is a special case of fuzzy measures defined iteratively. It has the following definition:

====Definition====
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \left\lbrace x_1,\dots,x_n  \right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;  be a finite set and let &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (-1,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. A '''Sugeno &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-measure''' is a function &lt;math&gt;g:2^X\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that

# &lt;math&gt;g(X) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
# if &lt;math&gt;A, B\subseteq \mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; (alternatively &lt;math&gt;A, B\in 2^{\mathbf{X}}&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;g(A \cup B) =g(A)+g(B)+\lambda g(A)g(B)&lt;/math&gt;.

As a convention, the value of g at a singleton set &lt;math&gt;\left\lbrace x_i \right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;
is called a density and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;g_i = g(\left\lbrace x_i \right\rbrace)&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, we have that &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the property

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda +1 = \prod_{i=1}^n (1+\lambda g_i) &lt;/math&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Wang and Klir have showed that once the densities are known, it is possible to use the previous [[polynomial]] to obtain the values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; uniquely.

===''k''-additive fuzzy measure===

The ''k''-additive fuzzy measure limits the interaction between the subsets &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq X &lt;/math&gt; to size &lt;math&gt;|E|=k&lt;/math&gt;.  This drastically reduces the number of variables needed to define the fuzzy measure, and as ''k'' can be anything from 1 (in which case the fuzzy measure is additive) to '''X''', it allows for a compromise between modelling ability and simplicity.

====Definition====

A discrete fuzzy measure ''g'' on a set '''X''' is called ''k-additive'' (&lt;math&gt; 1 \leq k \leq |\mathbf{X}|&lt;/math&gt;) if its Möbius representation verifies &lt;math&gt;M(E) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt; |E| &gt; k &lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt;, and there exists a subset ''F'' with ''k'' elements such that &lt;math&gt; M(F) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

==Shapley and interaction indices==

In [[game]] theory, the [[Shapley value]] or Shapley index is used to indicate the weight of a game.  Shapley values can be calculated for fuzzy measures in order to give some indication of the importance of each singleton.  In the case of additive fuzzy measures, the Shapley value will be the same as each singleton.

For a given fuzzy measure ''g'', and &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{X}|=n&lt;/math&gt;, the Shapley index for every &lt;math&gt; i,\dots,n \in X &lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt; \phi (i) = \sum_{E \subseteq \mathbf{X} \backslash \{i\}} \frac{(n-|E|-1)!|E|!}{n!} [g(E \cup \{i\}) - g(E)]. &lt;/math&gt;

The Shapley value is the vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\phi}(g) = (\psi(1),\dots,\psi(n)).&lt;/math&gt;

In computing, '''Gist''' is a scientific graphics library written in [[C (programming language)|C]] by [[David H. Munro]] of [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. It supports  three graphics output devices: [[X Window]], [[PostScript]], and [[Computer Graphics Metafile]]s (CGM). The library is promoted as being small (writing directly to Xlib), efficient, and full-featured. Portability is restricted to systems running [[X Window]] (essentially the [[Unix]] world).

There is a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] port called PyGist; it is used as one of several optional graphics front-ends of the scientific library [[SciPy]]. PyGist is also ported to [[Mac OS|Mac]] and [[MS Windows]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20435">[[Materials science]] has shaped the development of civilizations since the dawn of mankind. Better materials for tools and weapons has allowed mankind to spread and conquer, and advancements in material processing like steel and aluminum production continue to impact society today. Historians have regarded materials as such an important aspect of civilizations such that entire periods of time have defined by the predominant material used ([[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], etc.). For most of recorded history, control of materials had been through alchemy or empirical means at best. The study and development of chemistry and physics assisted the study of materials, and eventually the interdisciplinary study of materials science emerged from the fusion of these studies.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf E.|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-26691-6|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''history of materials science''' is the study of how different materials were used and developed through the history of Earth and how those materials affected the culture of the peoples of the Earth.

==Prehistory==
[[File:Feuersteinaxt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Flint axe, about 31 cm long.]]

In many cases different cultures leave their materials as the only records which [[anthropologists]] can use to define the existence of such cultures.  The progressive use of more sophisticated materials allows archeologists to characterize and distinguish between peoples.  This is partially due to the major material of use in a culture and to its associated benefits and drawbacks.  [[Stone-Age]] cultures were limited by which rocks they could find locally and by which they could acquire by trading.  The use of [[flint]] around 300,000 BCE is sometimes{{when|date=October 2015}} considered the beginning of the use of [[ceramic]]s. The use of polished [[stone axe]]s marks a significant advance because a much wider variety of rocks could serve as tools.

[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|left|150px|A late [[Bronze Age sword]]- or dagger-blade.]]

The innovation of smelting and casting metals in the [[Bronze Age]] started to change the way that cultures developed and interacted with each other.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Starting around 5500 BCE, early [[metalsmith|smith]]s began to re-shape [[native metal]]s of [[copper]] and [[gold]] - without the use of fire - for tools and weapons.  The heating of copper and its shaping with hammers began around 5000 BCE.  Melting and casting started around 4000 BCE.  [[Metallurgy]] had its dawn with the reduction of copper from its ore around 3500 BCE.  The first [[alloy]], [[bronze]] came into use around 3000 BCE. [[Iron]]-working came into prominence from about 1200 BCE.

In the 10th century BCE [[glass]] production began in [[ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd century BCE people in [[History of India|ancient India]] developed [[wootz steel]], the first [[crucible steel]]. In the 1st century BCE [[glassblowing]] techniques flourished in [[Phoenicia]]. In the 2nd century CE [[steel]]-making became widespread in [[Han Dynasty]] China. The 4th century CE saw the production of the [[Iron pillar of Delhi]], the oldest surviving example of corrosion-resistant steel.

==Antiquity==
[[File:Ac.pantheon1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]].]]

[[Wood]], [[bone]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], and [[earth]] are some of the materials which formed the structures of the [[Roman Empire]]. Certain structures were made possible by the character of the land upon which these structures are built; a volcanic peninsula with stone aggregates and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] containing [[crystal]]line material will produce material which weathers differently from soft, sedimentary rock and silt. That is one of the reasons that the [[concrete]] [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] of [[Rome]] could last for 1850 years, and  why the [[thatch]]ed [[farmhouse]]s of [[Holland]] sketched by [[Rembrandt]] have long since decayed.

After the [[thigh]][[bone]] [[dagger]]s of the early [[hunter-gatherer]]s were superseded by wood and stone axes, and then by [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[iron]] implements of the Roman civilization, more precious materials could then be sought, and gathered together. Thus the [[medieval]] goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] could seek and defend the gold which he had to turn into objects of desire for [[duke]]s and [[pope]]s. ''[[The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini]]'' contains one of the first descriptions of a metallurgical process.

==Stone Age==

The use of materials begins in the stone age. Typically materials such as bone, fibers, feathers, shells, animal skin, and clay were used for weapons, tools, jewelry, and shelter. The earliest tools were in the paleolithic age, called Oldowan. These were tools created from chipped rocks that would be used for scavenging purpose. As history carried on into the Mesolithic age, tools became more complex and symmetrical in design with sharper edges. Moving into the Neolithic age, agriculture began to develop as new was to form tools for farming were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Christian|title=Stone Age|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearing the end of the stone age, humans began using copper, gold, and silver as a material. Due to these metals softness, the general use was for ceremonial purposes and to create ornaments or decorations and did not replace other materials for use in tools.

The use of copper had become very apparent to civilizations, such as its properties of elasticity and plasticity that allow it to be hammered into useful shapes, along with its ability to be melted and pored into intricate shapes. Although the advantages of copper were many, the materials was to soft to find large scale usefulness. Through experimentation or by chance, additions to copper lead to increased hardness of a new metal alloy, called bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science: History, Properties, Application|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze was originally composed of copper and arsenic, forming arsenic bronze.

==Middle Ages==

Proto-porcelain material has been discovered dating back to the Neolthic period, with shards of material found in archaeological sites from the Eastern Han period in China.  These wares are estimated to have been fired from 1260 to 1300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=He|title=Chinese ceramics : the new standard guide|date=1996|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-23727-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century, [[porcelain]] was invented in [[Tang Dynasty]] China. Porcelain in china resulted in a methodical development of widely used kilns that increased the quality and quantity that procelain could be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/porcelain-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279-dynasties|title=Porcelain in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing]] of ceramics is invented by [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arabic chemists]] and [[Islamic pottery|potters]] in [[Basra]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mason |first=Robert B. |title=New Looks at Old Pots: Results of Recent Multidisciplinary Studies of Glazed Ceramics from the Islamic World |journal=Muqarnas: Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture |year=1995 |volume=XII |isbn=978-9004103146 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, [[Stoneware|stonepaste ceramics]] were invented in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt; and [[lustreware]] appeared in [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 86–87, ''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 11th century, [[Damascus steel]] is developed in the [[Middle East]]. In the 15th century, [[Johann Gutenberg]] develops [[type metal]] alloy and Angelo Barovier invents [[cristallo]], a clear soda-based glass.

==Early modern period==
In the 16th century, [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]] publishes his Pirotechnia, the first systematic book on [[metallurgy]], [[Georg Agricola]] writes De Re Metallica, an influential book on [[metallurgy]] and [[mining]], and glass [[lens (optics)|lens]] are developed in the [[Netherlands]] and used for the first time in [[microscope]]s and [[telescope]]s.

In the 17th century, [[Galileo]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' ([[strength of materials]] and [[kinematics]]) includes the first quantitative statements in the science of materials. In the 18th century, [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patents a process for the production of metallic [[zinc]] by [[distillation]] from [[calamine]] and charcoal, [[Bryan Higgins]] was issued a [[patent]] for hydraulic cement ([[stucco]]) for use as an exterior [[plaster]], and [[Alessandro Volta]] makes a copper/zinc [[acid]] [[battery (electricity)|battery]].

In the 19th century, [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] invents the [[thermocouple]], Joseph Aspin invents [[Portland cement]], [[Charles Goodyear]] invents [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]], [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[William Fox Talbot]] invent [[silver]]-based [[photography|photographic]] processes, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] demonstrates color photography, and [[Charles Fritts]] makes the first [[solar cell]]s using [[selenium]] waffles.

Before the early 1800s, [[aluminum]] had not been produced as an isolated metal.  It wasn't until 1825 that [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovered how to create elemental aluminum via the reduction of aluminum chloride.  Since aluminum is a light element with good mechanical properties, it was widely sought to replace heavier less functional metals like silver and gold.  Napoleon III used aluminum plates and utensils for his honored guests, while the rest were given silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Tom|title=Aluminum: Common Metal, Uncommon Past|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/aluminum-common-metal-uncommon-past|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this process was still expensive and was still not able to produce the metal in large quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production of Aluminum: The Hall-Héroult Process|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/aluminumprocess.html|website=American Chemical Society|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1886, American [[Charles Martin Hall]] and Frenchman [[Paul Héroult]] invented a process completely independent of each other to produce aluminum from aluminum oxide via electrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Totten|first1=George E.|title=Handbook of aluminum|date=2003|publisher=Dekker|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-8247-0896-2|edition=10. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process would allow aluminum to be manufactured cheaper than ever before, and laid the groundwork for turning the element from a precious metal into an easily obtainable commodity.  Around the same time in 1888, [[Carl Josef Bayer]] was working in St Petersburg, Russia to develop a method to make pure alumina for the textile industry.  This process involved dissolving the aluminum oxide out of the bauxite mineral to produce gibbsite, which can then be purified back into raw alumina.  The [[Bayer process]] and the [[Hall-Héroult process]] are still used today to produce a majority of the world's alumina and aluminum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayer's Process for Alumina Production: A Historical Production|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/num17-18/num17-18%20p15-19.pdf|website=scs.illinois.edu|publisher=Fathi Habashi, Laval University|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material Science as a Field of Study==
Most fields of studies have a founding father, such as Newton in physics and Lavoisier in chemistry. Materials science on the other hand has no central figure that set in motion materials studies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vincent|first1=Bernedetta|title=Materials science and engineering: an artificial discipline about to explode|website=History of Recent Materials Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, wartime collaborations of multiple fields of study to produce technological advances became a structure to the future field of study that would become known as material science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olson|first1=Gregory|title=A Materials Science Timeline|website=Materials World Modules}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cold War in the 1950s, US President Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) made materials a priority when it realized that materials were the limiting factor for advances in space and military technology. The Department of defense signed a contract with 5 universities (Harvard, MIT, Brown, Stanford, and Chicago) providing over $13 million for material research. Several institutions departments changed titles from "metallurgy" to "metallurgy and materials science" in 1960's.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Modern materials science==

In the early part of the 20th century, most engineering schools had a department of [[metallurgy]] and perhaps of [[ceramic]]s as well.  Much effort was expended on consideration of the [[austenite]]-[[martensite]]-[[cementite]] phases found in the iron-carbon [[phase diagram]] that underlies [[steel]] production.  The fundamental understanding of other materials was not sufficiently advanced for them to be considered as academic subjects.  In the post-WWII era, the systematic study of [[polymer]]s advanced particularly rapidly. Rather than create new polymer science departments in engineering schools, administrators and scientists began to conceive of materials science as a new interdisciplinary field in its own right, one that considered all substances of engineering importance from a unified point of view.  [[Northwestern University]] instituted the first materials science department in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matsci.northwestern.edu/about/index.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high temperature materials. He pioneered high temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high temperature materials. His vision for interdisciplinary research played a key role in the creation of the Materials Research Institute. Tressler's contribution to materials science is celebrated with a Penn State lecture named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matse.psu.edu/about-us/lectures-and-awards/tressler Richard E. Tressler lecture in Materials Science] from [[Penn State]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Materials Research Society (MRS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrs.org Materials Research Society]&lt;/ref&gt; has been instrumental in creating an identity and cohesion for this young field.  MRS was the brainchild of researchers at [[Penn State University]] and grew out of discussions initiated by Prof. [[Rustum Roy]] in 1970.  The first meeting of MRS was held in 1973.  As of 2006{{Update inline|date=February 2018}}, MRS has grown into an international society that sponsors a large number of annual meetings and has over 13,000 members.  MRS sponsors meetings that are subdivided into symposia on a large variety of topics as opposed to the more focused meetings typically sponsored by organizations like the [[American Physical Society]] or the [[IEEE]].  The fundamentally interdisciplinary nature of MRS meetings has had a strong influence on the direction of science, particularly in the popularity of the study of [[soft materials]], which are in the nexus of biology, chemistry, physics and mechanical and electrical engineering.
Because of the existence of integrative textbooks, [[materials research societies]] and university chairs in all parts of the world, BA, MA and PhD programs and other indicators of discipline formation, it is fair to call materials science (and engineering) a discipline.&lt;ref&gt;See Cahn (2001) and Hentschel (2011) for further references and detailed analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] created the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]] (ARPA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DoD Directive Establishes the Advanced Research Projects Agency|url=https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/dod-establishes-arpa|website=www.darpa.mil|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) since 1996. In 1960, ARPA encouraged the establishment of interdisciplinary laboratories (IDL's) on university campuses, which would be dedicated to the research of materials, as well as to the education of students on how to conduct materials science research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Materials Research|last=Psaras|first=Peter A.|publisher=National Academy Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA offered 4-year IDL contracts to universities, originally to [[Cornell University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Northwestern University]], eventually granting 9 more contracts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/Timeline/index.html|title=A Selected History of DARPA Innovation|last=|first=|date=|website=DARPA|access-date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ARPA is no longer in control of the IDL program (the [[National Science Foundation]] took over the program in 1972&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), the original establishment of IDL's marked a significant milestone in the [[United States]]' research and development of materials science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1888">'''Indian political philosophy''' may be categorized into several distinct traditions, including: the [[Vedic]] (c. 1200 BCE - 10th century CE); the [[Jainism|Jain]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]]-[[Hinduism|Hindu]] (6th century BCE - 2nd century CE); the [[Islam in India|Indo-Islamic]] (10th century CE-1857); the modern or [[British Raj|Indo-British]] (c. 1857 - 1947); and the contemporary (post-independence - present).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Introduction|title=Indian Political Thought: Themes and Thinkers|page=xiv

In India as elsewhere, [[political philosophy]] involves on the one hand speculations on the relationships between individual, society and state, and detailed treatises on the mechanics of statecraft, state policy, war and diplomacy and [[international relations]].

Contemporary Indian political philosophy is an emerging discipline garnering increasing interest with the rise of [[comparative political theory]]. The Indian political theorist Aakash Singh Rathore has been attempting to cultivate the discipline with the 2010 book ''Indian Political Thought--A Reader'' (Routledge), and the 2017 monograph ''Indian Political Theory: Laying the Groundwork for Svaraj'' (Routledge).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8375">'''Integrative bioinformatics''' is a discipline of [[bioinformatics]] that focuses on problems of [[data integration]] for the [[life sciences]].

With the rise of [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput]] (HTP) technologies in the life sciences, particularly in [[molecular biology]], the amount of collected [[data]] has grown in an exponential fashion. Furthermore, the data are scattered over a plethora of both public and private [[Information repository|repositories]], and are stored using a large number of different [[file format|formats]]. This situation makes searching these data and performing the analysis necessary for the extraction of new knowledge from the complete set of available data very difficult. Integrative bioinformatics attempts to tackle this problem by providing unified access to life science data.

==Approaches==

===Semantic web approaches===
In the [[Semantic Web]] approach, data from multiple websites or databases is searched via [[metadata]]. Metadata is [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] code, which defines the contents of the page for the program so that the comparisons between the data and the search terms are more accurate. This serves to decrease the number of results that are irrelevant or unhelpful. Some meta-data exists as definitions called [[ontologies]], which can be tagged by either users or programs; these serve to facilitate searches by using key terms or phrases to find and return the data.&lt;ref name="Doms"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Doms, A.  |author2=Schroeder, M.|year=2005|title=GoPubMed: exploring PubMed with the Gene Ontology|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|accessdate=28 September 2012|url=http://www.gene-quantification.de/doms-schroeder-gopubmed-2005.pdf|doi=10.1093/nar/gki470|pmid=15980585|pmc=1160231|volume=33|issue=Web Server issue|pages=W783–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages of this approach include the general increased quality of the data returned in searches and with proper tagging, ontologies finding entries that may not explicitly state the search term but are still relevant.  One disadvantage of this approach is that the results that are returned come in the format of the database of their origin and as such, direct comparisons may be difficult. Another problem is that the terms used in tagging and searching can sometimes be ambiguous and may cause confusion among the results.&lt;ref name="VanOphuizen"&gt;Van Ophuizen, E.A.A. &amp; Leunissen, J.A.M. (2010). "An evaluation of the performance of three semantic background knowledge sources in comparative anatomy." Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics. Retrieved 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the semantic web approach is still considered an emerging technology and is not in wide-scale use at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Ruttenberg, et al. (2007). "Advancing translational research with the Semantic Web."  BMC Bioinformatics. Retrieved 28 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the current applications of ontology-based search in the biomedical sciences is [[GoPubMed]], which searches the [[PubMed]] database of scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Doms" /&gt;  Another use of ontologies is within databases such as [[SwissProt]], [[Ensembl]] and [[TrEMBL]], which use this technology to search through the stores of human proteome-related data for tags related to the search term.&lt;ref name="Verscheldeet"&gt;Verschelde, et al. (2007). "Ontology-Assisted Database Integration to Support [[Natural Language Processing]] and Biomedical Data-mining." Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics. Retrieved 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the research in this field has focused on creating new and specific ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;Castillo, et al. (2012). "Construction of coffee transcriptome networks based on gene annotation semantics." Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics. Retrieved 29 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have worked on verifying the results of existing ontologies.&lt;ref name="VanOphuizen" /&gt; In a specific example, the goal of Verschelde, et al. was the integration of several different ontology libraries into a larger one that contained more definitions of different subspecialties (medical, molecular biological, etc.) and was able to distinguish between ambiguous tags; the result was a data-warehouse like effect, with easy access to multiple databases through the use of ontologies.&lt;ref name="Verscheldeet" /&gt; In a separate project, Bertens, et al. constructed a lattice work of three ontologies (for anatomy and development of model organisms) on a novel framework ontology of generic organs. For example, results from a search of ‘heart’ in this ontology would return the heart plans for each of the vertebrate species whose ontologies were included. The stated goal of the project is to facilitate comparative and evolutionary studies.&lt;ref&gt;Bertens, et al. (2011). "A generic organ based ontology system, applied to vertebrate heart anatomy, development and physiology." Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics. Retrieved 30 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data warehousing approaches===
In the [[data warehousing]] strategy, the data from different sources are extracted and integrated in a single database. For example, various [[List of omics topics in biology|'omics']] datasets may be integrated to provide biological insights into biological systems. Examples include data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, interactomics, metabolomics. Ideally, changes in these sources are regularly synchronized to the integrated database. The data is presented to the users in a common format. Many programs aimed to aid in the creation of such warehouses are designed to be extremely versatile to allow for them to be implemented in diverse research projects.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, et al. (2005). "Atlas&amp;nbsp;– a data warehouse for integrative bioinformatics." BMC Bioinformatics. Retrieved 30 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage of this approach is that data is available for analysis at a single site, using a uniform schema. Some disadvantages are that the datasets are often huge and difficult to keep up to date. Another problem with this method is that it is costly to compile such a warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;Kuenne, et al. (2007). "Using Data Warehouse Technology in Crop Plant Bioinformatics." Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics. Retrieved 30 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Standardized formats for different types of data (ex: protein data) are now emerging due to the influence of groups like the [[Proteomics Standards Initiative]] (PSI). Some data warehousing projects even require the submission of data in one of these new formats.&lt;ref&gt;Thiele, et al. (2010). "Bioinformatics Strategies in Life Sciences: From Data Processing and Data Warehousing to Biological Knowledge Extraction." Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics. Retrieved 29 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches===
[[Data mining]] uses statistical methods to search for patterns in existing data. This method generally returns many patterns, of which some are spurious and some are significant, but all of the patterns the program finds must be evaluated individually.  Currently, some research is focused on incorporating existing data mining techniques with novel pattern analysis methods that reduce the need to spend time going over each pattern found by the initial program, but instead, return a few results with a high likelihood of relevance.&lt;ref&gt;Belmamoune, et al. (2010). "Mining and Analysing Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Gene Expression in An Integrative database Framework." Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics. Retrieved 27 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback of this approach is that it does not integrate multiple databases, which means that comparisons across databases are not possible.   The major advantage to this approach is that it allows for the generation of new hypotheses to test.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3206">The '''International Space Olympics''' (ISO) is an annual two-week competition for teenagers aged from 14 to 18, held in [[Korolyov, Moscow Oblast|Korolyov]], [[Russia]].

On days when participants are not competing, they are given tours of some of Russia's top space facilities and areas of [[Culture|cultural significance]], and even have a chance to videochat with astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS. Participants come from a wide range of countries, with each country represented as a team. In previous years, teams have attended from [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Israel]], [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibby.net/korolev/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vesa.org.uk/aimhigher-leicester-shire/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=13&amp;cntnt01returnid=39&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States|the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roanoke.com/neighbors/school/wb/135405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doe.virginia.gov/info_centers/superintendents_memos/2008/06_jun/inf140.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://worldnetva.pwnet.org/russia2000/about/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kazakhstan]], [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gg.gov.au/governorgeneral/news.php?action=view&amp;id=19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guidesaus.org.au/page.php?pageid=164&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spain]] and [[Russia]]. Overall, in 2012 there were 130 participating students, in 2013 and 2014 - over 200. Over the years, the International Space Olympics has been attended by over 1,850 Russian students, as well as more than 800 students from other countries. 

The Olympics are held on the initiative of S. P. Korolyov Energia Space and Rocket Corporation and has an international status. The Opening Ceremony is usually started by the heads of Korolyov City, the Moscow region, municipal heads of education, pilots, cosmonauts and representatives from RSC Energia and MCC (mission control center in Korolyov).

Sometimes, in the media, the Space Olympics is referred to as an "international space olympics camp" for students or "an intellectual marathon". When in Russia, the competitors usually stay at a hostel, and at the end of the week they are taken to the country to sum up the whole event, to hold the award ceremony, to celebrate, and to have a "good-bye" party.

In 2014 China and Venezuela voiced their desire to participate in Space Olympic Games for the first time. Moreover, it is this year that freshmen and sophomores were considered for participation.

In the 2012 competition, Alex Gagliano won 1st place in [[Astrophysics]] presentations and Austin Chung won 1st place in Space History and Policy.

In the 2013 competition, Josh Ting won 1st place in Astrophysics and Hema Narlapati won 1st place in Space Policy.

'''Jovan Hadži''' (22 November 1884 – 11 December 1972) was a [[Slovenia]]n [[zoologist]] of [[Serbs|Serbian]] origin.

==Biography==
Hadži was born in a Serbian family in Temišvar (today [[Timişoara]], [[Romania]]) in what was then [[Austria-Hungary]]. He began his career in [[Zagreb]]. In 1920, he moved to Ljubljana where he became the head of zoological institute at the then established [[University of Ljubljana]]. Between 1951 and 1972, Hadži was the head of the Biological institute at [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SASA). In 1938, he became a full member of SASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sazu.si/o-sazu/clani/umrli.html |title=Umrli člani SAZU |publisher=Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts |language=Slovenian |accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadži was perhaps most widely known for his unique theories of animal evolution. He devised a system of classification in which he divided the animal kingdom into six [[Phylum|phyla]]: [[Protozoa]], [[Parazoa]], "Ameria" (animals with no segments), "Oligomeria" (animals with few segments), "Polymeria" (animals with many segments) and [[Chordata]]. His choice of characters important for classification was generally discredited by his contemporaries, and the system was never accepted by zoologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carter G.S. |title=On Hadži's Interpretations of Animal Phylogeny |doi=10.2307/2411377 |jstor=2411377 |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=3 |issue=4 |year=1954 |pages=163–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to its simplicity, the system was widely used in science education in former Yugoslavia. His other major theory was that of the origin of metazoa - he developed an existing hypothesis stating that the first multicellular animals resembling today's [[turbellaria|flatworms]] evolved from [[multinucleate]] [[ciliate]]s in which [[Cell nucleus|cell nuclei]] became separated by [[cellular membrane]]s. Again, the theory emphasized similarities of structure while disregarding other important characters, so it was never generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kotpal R.L. |chapter=Origin of metazoa |url=https://books.google.si/books?id=JuuWlZ7Llb8C&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=turbellarian+had%C5%BEi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hXT7tCIiZe&amp;sig=4PNLEYThCNQBldnKoeafM5ONfso&amp;hl=sl&amp;ei=G3vBS9TpGYT4OaLywJYE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Modern Text Book of Zoology: Invertebrates |year=2008 |edition=10th |pages=192–193 |publisher=Rastogi Publications |isbn=978-81-7133-903-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadži's faunistical work focused on the [[invertebrate]] fauna of caves and mountains where he described more than a hundred new species and [[genus|genera]]. He was also an active cave explorer and acted as a president of the Slovenian society for cave exploration (Društvo za raziskovanje jam Slovenije) between 1927 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dzrjl.si/content/zgodovina-dzrjl |title=Zgodovina DZRJL |publisher=Društvo za raziskovanje jam Ljubljana |language=Slovenian |accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his contributions to zoology, Hadži received [[Prešeren Award]] in 1956. In 1969, he received the honorary doctorate by the University of Ljubljana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-lj.si/o_univerzi_v_ljubljani/castni_doktorji_ul.aspx |title=Častni doktorji Univerze |publisher=University of Ljubljana |accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several invertebrate species were named after him by other zoologists, such as ''[[Astagobius hadzii]]'', ''[[Cyclopina hadzii]]'', ''[[Isohypsibius hadzii]]'', and ''[[Niphargus hadzii]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2214">The '''Levich equation''' models the diffusion and solution flow conditions around a [[rotating disk electrode]] (RDE). It is named after [[Veniamin Grigorievich Levich]] who first developed an RDE as a tool for electrochemical research. It can be used to predict the current observed at an RDE, in particular, the Levich equation gives the height of the [[Sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] wave observed in rotating disk voltammetry. The sigmoidal wave height is often called the Levich current.

==Equation==
The Levich equation is written as:

:&lt;math&gt;I_L = (0.620) n F A D^\frac{2}{3}  \omega^\frac{1}{2}v^\frac{-1}{6}C&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the Levich current (A), ''n'' is the number of moles of [[electrons]] transferred in the [[half reaction]] (number), ''F'' is the [[Faraday constant]] (C/mol), ''A'' is the electrode area (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), ''D'' is the diffusion coefficient (see [[Fick's law of diffusion]]) (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s), ''ω'' is the angular rotation rate of the electrode (rad/s), ''v'' is the kinematic viscosity (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s), ''C'' is the [[analyte]] concentration (mol/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

To use the equation as written above (with the leading 0.620), radians per second for angular rotation units must be used. If revolution (rotations) per minute (rpm) are used, a value of 0.201 should be used in place of 0.620.

Whereas the Levich equation suffices for many purposes, improved forms based on derivations utilising more terms in the velocity expression are available.&lt;ref&gt;John Newman, J. Phys. Chem., 1966, 70 (4), 1327-1328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = Wiley | isbn = 0-471-04372-9 | last = Bard | first = Allen J. |author2=Larry R. Faulkner | title = Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications | date = 2000-12-18 | page = 339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simplified form ==
The Levich equation is often simplified by defining a Levich constant ''B'' such that:

:&lt;math&gt;I_L = \underbrace{(0.620) n F A D^\frac{2}{3} v^\frac{-1}{6}C}_{B} \, \omega^\frac{1}{2}=B\, \omega^{0.5}&lt;/math&gt;

('''outdated map''')]]

The '''Nordic Cross flag''' is any of certain flags bearing the design of the '''Nordic or Scandinavian cross''', a [[cross symbol]] in a rectangular field, with the center of the cross shifted towards the [[Glossary of vexillology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|hoist]].

All of the [[Nordic countries]] except [[Greenland]] have adopted such flags in the modern period, and while the Scandinavian cross is named for its use in the national flags of the Scandinavian nations, the term is used universally by [[Vexillology|vexillologists]], in reference not only to the flags of the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enchantedlearning.com/geography/flags/scancross.shtml EnchantedLearning.com]; [http://tmg110.tripod.com/scan_cross.htm Historical flags of the world: The Scandinavian cross]; Eric Inglefield: "Fahnen und Flaggen" (translated to German by Dagmar Hahn), Delphin Verlag, Munich 1986, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Christian cross|cross]] design represents [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name="Jeroen Temperman"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Khag6tbsIn4C&amp;pg=PA88 |author=Jeroen Temperman|title=State Religion Relationships and Human Rights Law: Towards a Right to Religiously Neutral Governance |page=88 |publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]]|quote=Many predominantly Christian states show a cross, symbolising Christianity, on their national flag.

As a badge of divine right, Denmark flew its cross in the other Scandinavian countries it ruled and as each nation gained independence, they incorporated the Christian symbol.|accessdate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the characteristic shift of the center to the hoist side is early modern, first described the Danish civil ensign (''Koffardiflaget'') for merchant ships in a regulation of 11 June 1748, which specified the shift of the cross center towards the hoist as "the two first fields must be square in form and the two outer fields must be {{frac|6|4}} lengths of those". The Danish design was adopted for the flags of [[flag of Norway|Norway]] (civil ensign 1821) and [[flag of Sweden|Sweden]] (1906), both derived from a common ensign used during the [[Union between Sweden and Norway]] 1818&amp;ndash;1844, as well as [[flag of Iceland|Iceland]] (1915) and [[flag of Finland|Finland]] (1917); some of the subdivisions of these countries used this as inspiration for their own flags. The [[Flag of Norway|Norwegian]] flag was the first Nordic cross flag with three colours. 
All Nordic flags may be flown as [[gonfalon]]s as well.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Flags of the Nordic countries==
Note that some of these flags are historical. Also, note that [[Flag terminology|flag proportions]] may vary between the different flags and sometimes even between different versions of the same flag.

The [[Flag of Greenland]] is the only national flag of a Nordic country or territory without a [[Nordic Cross]]. When Greenland was granted home rule, the present flag - with a graphic design unique to Greenland  - was adopted on June 1985, supported by fourteen votes against eleven who supported a proposed green-and-white Nordic cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/nu-vajer-det-groenlandske-flag-over-danmark|title=Nu vajer det grønlandske flag over Danmark|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Nordic flag designs very similar to [[Denmark]]'s, [[Sweden]]'s, and [[Norway]]'s national flags were proposed as Germany's national flags in both 1919 and 1948, after [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], respectively. Today, the Nordic cross is a feature in some city and district flags or coats of arms.

File:Flag of Denmark.svg|{{FIAV|historical}}Flag of the Danish monarch, flown in his capacity as Duke of [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]], [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]] and [[Saxe-Lauenburg|Lauenburg]]. The three duchies were [[Treaty of Vienna (1864)|ceded]] to [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Prussia]] in 1864 as a result of the [[Second Schleswig War]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1844, pro-German nationalists in the two duchies of Holstein and Schleswig created a blue-white-red tricolour as a symbol for independence which began to see widespread use. In 1845, Denmark responded by outlawing all other flags than the Danish one shown here. This ban was enforced as long as Denmark controlled the three duchies (Holstein and Lauenburg: effectively until 1863, Schleswig effectively until 1864.) Use of the Danish flag was in turn outlawed by the secessionist government that claimed the three duchies between 1848–1851.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Oceanic basin.svg|400px|thumb|Diagrammatic cross-section of an ocean basin, showing the various [[geographic]] features]]

In [[hydrology]], an '''oceanic basin''' may be anywhere on [[Earth]] that is covered by [[seawater]] but geologically '''ocean basins''' are large [[Structural basin|geologic basins]] that are below [[sea level]]. Geologically, there are other undersea [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] features such as the [[Continental shelf|continental shelves]], the deep [[Oceanic trench|ocean trenches]], and the [[undersea mountain range]]s (for example, the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge|mid-Atlantic ridge]] and the [[Emperor Seamounts]]) which are not considered to be part of the ocean basins; while hydrologically, oceanic basins include the flanking continental shelves and shallow, [[epeiric sea]]s.

==History==
Older references  (e.g., Littlehales 1930)&lt;ref&gt;Littlehales, G. W. (1930) ''The configuration of the oceanic basins'' Graficas Reunidas, Madrid, Spain, {{OCLC|8506548}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider the oceanic basins to be the complement to the [[continent]]s, with [[erosion]] dominating the latter, and the [[sediment]]s so derived ending up in the ocean basins.  More modern sources (e.g., Floyd 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, P. A. (1991) ''Oceanic basalts'' Blackie, Glasgow, Scotland, {{ISBN|978-0-216-92697-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; regard the ocean basins more as [[basalt]]ic plains, than as sedimentary depositories, since most sedimentation occurs on the continental shelves and not in the geologically-defined ocean basins.&lt;ref&gt;Biju-Duval, Bernard (2002) ''Sedimentary geology: sedimentary basins, depositional environments, petroleum formation'' Editions Technip, Paris, {{ISBN|978-2-7108-0802-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrologically some geologic basins are both above and below sea level, such as the [[Maracaibo Basin]] in [[Venezuela]], although geologically it is not considered an oceanic basin because it is on the continental shelf and underlain by [[continental crust]].

Earth is the only known planet in the [[solar system]] where [[hypsography]] is characterized by different kinds of crust, [[oceanic crust]] and [[continental crust]].&lt;ref&gt;Ebeling, Werner and Feistel, Rainer (2002) ''Physics of Self-Organization and Evolution'' Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mEawbqTxv50C&amp;pg=PA141 page 141], {{ISBN|978-3-527-40963-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans cover 70% of the Earth's surface. Because oceans lie lower than continents, the former serve as [[sedimentary basin]]s that collect sediment eroded from the continents, known as [[clastic]] sediments, as well as precipitation sediments. Ocean basins also serve as repositories for the skeletons of [[carbonate]]- and [[silica]]-secreting [[organism]]s such as [[coral reefs]], [[diatoms]], [[radiolarian]]s, and [[foraminifera]].

Geologically, an oceanic basin may be actively changing size or may be relatively, tectonically inactive, depending on whether there is a moving [[plate tectonic]] boundary associated with it.  The elements of an active - and growing - oceanic basin include an elevated [[mid-ocean ridge]], flanking [[abyssal hill]]s leading down to [[abyssal plain]]s.  The elements of an active oceanic basin often include the [[oceanic trench]] associated with a [[subduction zone]].

The [[Atlantic ocean]] and the [[Arctic ocean]] are good examples of active, growing oceanic basins, whereas the [[Mediterranean Sea]] is shrinking. The [[Pacific Ocean]] is also an active, shrinking oceanic basin, even though it has both spreading ridge and oceanic trenches. Perhaps the best example of an inactive oceanic basin is the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which formed in [[Jurassic]] times and has been doing nothing but collecting sediments since then.&lt;ref name="Huerta"&gt;Huerta, Audrey D. and Harry, Dennis L.

'''''Of Moths and Men''''' is a book by [[journalist]] [[Judith Hooper]] about the [[Oxford University]] [[ecological genetics]] school led by [[E.B. Ford]].  The book specifically concerns [[Bernard Kettlewell]]'s experiments on the [[peppered moth]] which were intended as [[Peppered moth evolution|experimental validation of evolution]].  She highlights concerns about the methodology of Kettlewell's experiments and suggests that these issues could invalidate the results obtained, ignoring or disparaging evidence supporting [[natural selection]] while repeatedly implying that Kettlewell and his colleagues committed fraud or made careless errors.&lt;ref name=innuendo&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v90/n4/full/6800229a.html |title=Heredity - The art of innuendo |author=Bryan Clarke |authorlink=Bryan Clarke |year=2003 |journal=[[Heredity (journal)|Heredity]] |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=279–280 |accessdate=2008-07-11 | doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subject matter experts have described the book as presenting a "[[conspiracy theory]]" with "errors, misrepresentations, misinterpretations and falsehoods".

== Allegations of poor experimental practice ==

Hooper alleges several flaws in experimental methodology, including gluing the moths in place on parts of trees where they would not naturally settle, feeding birds heavily enough to condition them to expect feeding at that point, artificially boosting recapture rates, altering experiments (unconsciously) to favour the expected outcome, and errors in statistical analysis.

[[Historian of biology]] David Rudge has also carefully reexamined the records upon which Hooper's argument is based. His conclusions were that her historical research was poor and she had shown fundamental misunderstandings about the nature of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudge|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==

The book was described as well-written in reviews in the mainstream press,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/scienceandnature/0,6121,713294,00.html A review] in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/188251911.html?dids=188251911:188251911&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+20%2C+2002&amp;author=ANTHONY+DAY&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Book+Review%3B+Big+Lessons+From+Little+Moths&amp;pqatl=google A review] in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been criticised in scientific publications.  Writing in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', [[Jerry Coyne|Coyne]] (2002) attacked Hooper's "flimsy conspiracy theory [of] ambitious scientists who will ignore the truth for the sake of fame and recognition [by which] she unfairly smears a brilliant naturalist".  In ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Grant (2002) critically summarised the book's content, saying "What it delivers is a quasi-scientific assessment of the evidence for natural selection in the peppered moth (''Biston betularia''), much of which is cast in doubt by the author’s relentless suspicion of fraud".  [[Bryan Clarke]], who worked alongside Kettlewell at Oxford, described Hooper's book as "a treasury of insinuations worthy of an unscrupulous newspaper".&lt;ref name=innuendo/&gt;

The [[entomology|entomologist]] and expert on peppered moth evolution [[Michael Majerus]] described the book as "littered with errors, misrepresentations, misinterpretations and falsehoods"&lt;ref name="dd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/Majerus/Darwiniandisciple.doc |title=The Peppered moth: decline of a Darwinian disciple |accessdate=2008-07-11 |author=Michael Majerus |authorlink=Michael Majerus |coauthors= |year=2004 |format=.doc |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080627023646/http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/Majerus/Darwiniandisciple.doc &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-27 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published research specifically refuting some of Hooper's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Majerus, Michael |title=Non-morph specific predation of peppered moths (''Biston betularia'') by bats |journal=Ecological Entomology |publisher=[[Royal Entomological Society]]|volume=33|issue=5|pages=679–683 |year=2008 |pmid=|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.00987.x |url=}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8183">'''Phytogeography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] φυτό, ''phyto'' = "plant" and γεωγραφία, ''geografía'' = "geography" meaning also distribution) or '''botanical geography''' is the branch of [[biogeography]] that is concerned with the geographic distribution of [[plant]] [[species]] and their influence on the earth's surface. Phytogeography is concerned with all aspects of plant distribution, from the controls on the distribution of individual species ranges (at both large and small scales, see [[species distribution]]) to the factors that govern the composition of entire communities and [[flora]]s. '''Geobotany''', by contrast, focuses on the geographic space's influence on plants.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Fields ==
Phytogeography is part of a more general science known as [[biogeography]]. Phytogeographers are concerned with patterns and process in plant distribution. Most of the major questions and kinds of approaches taken to answer such questions are held in common between phyto- and zoogeographers.

Phytogeography in wider sense (or geobotany, in German literature) encompasses four fields, according with the focused aspect, environment, [[flora]] ([[taxon|taxa]]), [[vegetation]] ([[plant community]]) and origin, respectively:&lt;ref&gt;Rizzini, C.T. 1997. ''Tratado de fitogeografia do Brasil: aspectos ecológicos, sociológicos e florísticos''. 2 ed. Rio de Janeiro: Âmbito Cultural Edições, p. 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller-Dombois, D. &amp; Ellenberg, H (1974). ''Aims and Methods of Vegetation Ecology''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons. See Mueller-Dombois (2001), p. 567, [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dieter_Mueller-Dombois/publication/266616259_Island_Biogeography/links/54357dee0cf2dc341db2b13c.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pott, R. 2005. ''Allgemeine Geobotanik. Biogeosysteme und Biodiversität''. Springer: Berlin, p. 13, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ELkjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wulff, E.V. (1943). ''An Introduction to Historical Plant Geography''. Chronica Botanica Comp., Waltham, Mass., [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/6284#/summary].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[plant ecology]] (or [[mesology]] - however, the physiognomic-ecological approach on [[vegetation]] and [[biome]] study are also generally associated with this field);
* plant geography (or phytogeography in strict sense, [[chorology]], [[floristics]]);
* plant sociology (or [[phytosociology]], [[synecology]] - however, this field doesn't prescind from flora study, as its approach to study vegetation relies upon a fundamental unit, the [[plant association]], which is defined upon flora).
* historical plant geography (or [[paleobotany]], paleogeobotany)

Phytogeography is often divided into two main branches: [[ecological phytogeography]] and [[historical phytogeography]]. The former investigates the role of current day biotic and abiotic interactions in influencing plant distributions; the latter are concerned with historical reconstruction of the origin, dispersal, and extinction of taxa.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Overview ==

[[File:Cinnamon fern smokies.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|The basic data element of phytogeography are specimen records. These are collected individual plants like this one, a [[Cinnamon Fern]], collected in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of North Carolina.]]

The basic data elements of phytogeography are occurrence records (presence or absence of a species) with operational geographic units such as political units or geographical coordinates. These data are often used to construct phytogeographic provinces ([[floristic province]]s) and elements.

The questions and approaches in phytogeography are largely shared with [[zoogeography]], except zoogeography is concerned with animal distribution rather than plant distribution. The term phytogeography itself suggests a broad meaning. How the term is actually applied by practicing scientists is apparent in the way periodicals use the term. The ''[[American Journal of Botany]]'', a monthly primary research journal, frequently publishes a section titled "Systematics, Phytogeography, and Evolution." Topics covered in the ''American Journal of Botany'''s "Systematics and Phytogeography" section include [[phylogeography]], distribution of genetic variation and, [[historical biogeography]], and general plant species distribution patterns. Biodiversity patterns are not heavily covered.

== History ==

[[File:Alexander von Humboldt-selfportrait.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|An 1814 self-portrait in Paris of Alexander von Humboldt. Humboldt is often referred to as the "father of phytogeography".]]

Phytogeography has a long history. One of the subjects earliest proponents was Prussian naturalist [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who is often referred to as the "father of phytogeography". Von Humboldt advocated a quantitative approach to phytogeography that has characterized modern plant geography.

Gross patterns of the distribution of plants became apparent early on in the study of plant geography. For example, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], co-discoverer of the principle of natural selection, discussed the [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity]], a pattern observed in other organisms as well. Much research effort in plant geography has since then been devoted to understanding this pattern and describing it in more detail.

In 1890, the United States Congress passed an act that appropriated funds to send expeditions to discover the geographic distributions of plants (and animals) in the United States. The first of these was [[The Death Valley Expedition]], including [[Frederick Vernon Coville]], [[Frederick Funston]], [[Clinton Hart Merriam]], and others.&lt;ref name=DVE&gt;Death Valley Expedition (1891), Historic Expeditions, Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, [http://www.botany.si.edu/colls/expeditions/expedition_page.cfm?ExpedName=3]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Research in plant geography has also been directed to understanding the patterns of adaptation of species to the environment. This is done chiefly by describing geographical patterns of trait/environment relationships. These patterns termed ecogeographical [[Bergmann's rule|rules]] when applied to plants represent another area of phytogeography. Recently, a new field termed [[macroecology]] has developed, which focuses on broad-scale (in both time and space) patterns and phenomena in ecology. [[Macroecology]] focuses as much on other organisms as plants.

==Floristic regions==
[[File:Florenreiche.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Good (1947) floristic kingdoms]]
{{Main|Floristic regions}}
[[Floristic]]s is a study of the [[flora]] of some territory or area. Traditional phytogeography concerns itself largely with floristics and floristic classification, see [[floristic province]].

The '''Jesús Emilio Ramírez González Planetarium of Medellín''' ({{lang-es|Planetario Medellín de Jesús Emilio Ramírez González}}) is a [[planetarium]] located in [[Medellín, Colombia]] and established on October 10, 1984.&lt;ref name="Michelin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michelin|title=Colombia Green Guide Michelin 2012-2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPUPB37Ifl8C&amp;pg=PT297|accessdate=6 September 2013|date=1 March 2011|publisher=MICHELIN|isbn=978-2-06-718208-0|pages=297–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally conceived by the Astronomical Society of the College of San José, led at that time by Brother Daniel (Julián González Patiño), a renowned scientist, [[astronomer]], and [[botanist]]. The purpose is that the planetarium is a space for the promotion of scientific and technological culture of citizens and mentality that encourages scientific and technological creativity. The museum is surrounded by a public space known as the [[Park of Wishes]], which was designed by Felipe Uribe de Bedout to coordinate with the planetarium.&lt;ref name="HernándezHern?ndez2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Felipe Hernández|author2=Felipe Hern?ndez|title=Beyond Modernist Masters: Contem Porary Architecture in Latin America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TjFhrmhS-UIC&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=6 September 2013|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-0346-0495-6|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medellín was the first South American city to have a computer-controlled planetarium.&lt;ref name="Michelin2011" /&gt;

==History==
The planetarium is named after [[Jess Emilio Ramírez González]], a famous Colombian geophysicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetariomedellin.org/quienes-somos/historia/|title=Historia|work=planetariomedellin.org|publisher=Planetario de Medellín Jesús Emilio Ramírez González|accessdate=1 April 2016|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328095455/http://www.planetariomedellin.org/quienes-somos/historia/|archivedate=28 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planetarium is located in an area called the "North Zone" (Zona Norte), which is an [[urban sprawl]] area north of the city's center. The great socio-political instability of the 1980s and 1990s had an enormous effect on area like these where people from different strata lived. Insecurity and vandalism drove the observatory, the [[Botanical Garden of Medellín]], and even the [[University of Antioquia]] to consider relocation for a time.&lt;ref name="HernándezHern?ndez2010" /&gt; However, a series of urban interventions at the end of the 1990s—including a University stop on the [[Medellín Metro]]—prevented the closure of the three areas and helped to reconstitute the area.

==Renovations==
It was renovated in 2006 and comprises the largest recreational area, science and technology city, in the North Zone.&lt;ref name="Baker2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher P. Baker|title=National Geographic Traveler: Colombia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ28KAzMbZ8C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=6 September 2013|year=2012|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|isbn=978-1-4262-0950-5|pages=171–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its vicinity are located North Park, [[Parque Explora]], the [[Park of Wishes]] and several major units of the [[University of Antioquia]].

Since 2011, with support from the Mayor of Medellin, [[Bancolombia]], and various astronomical communities of the city, Parque Explora developed a project to renovate the planetarium. The core of this transformation was a new scientific visualization center.

The first floor, open access for visitors, consists of an auditorium with capacity for 200 people, a library specializing in science literacy, and a store with items and souvenirs on astronomy and a café.

'''Positive political theory''' or '''explanatory political theory''' is the study of [[politics]] using formal methods such as [[social choice theory]],  [[game theory]], and [[statistical analysis]]. In particular, social choice theoretic methods are often used to describe and (axiomatically) analyze the performance of rules or institutions.  The outcomes of the rules or institutions described are then analyzed by game theory, where the individuals/parties/nations involved in a given interaction are modeled as ''rational'' agents playing a game, guided by self-interest.  
Based on this assumption, the outcome of the interactions can be predicted as an equilibrium of the game.

The founder of the field was [[William H. Riker]]. In his book ''[[The Theory of Political Coalitions]]'' (1962), he applied the principles of [[game theory]] to the study of politics.

'''Pseudoplanktonic''' [[organism]]s are those that attach themselves to [[planktonic]] organisms or other floating objects, such as drifting wood, [[buoyant]] shells of organisms such as ''[[Spirula]]'', or man-made [[flotsam]]. Examples include [[goose barnacle]]s and the bryozoan ''[[Jellyella]]''. By themselves these animals cannot [[Buoyancy|float]], which contrasts them with true planktonic organisms, such as ''[[Velella]]'' and the [[Portuguese Man o' War]], which are buoyant. Pseudoplankton are often found in the guts of filtering [[Zooplankton|zooplankters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Coral Reef Ecology|first=Yuri I. |last=Sorokin|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date=12 March 2013|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKvrCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">The '''semantic feature comparison model''' is used "to derive [[prediction]]s about [[categorization]] times in a situation where a subject must rapidly decide whether a test item is a member of a particular target category".&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, E. E., Shoben. E. J., and Rips, L. J. (1974). Structure and Process in Semantic Memory: A Feature Model for Semantic Decisions. Psychological Review, 81(3), 214–241.&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[semantic model]], there is an assumption that certain occurrences are categorized using its features or attributes of the two subjects that represent the part and the group. A statement often used to explain this model is "a [[European robin|robin]] is a bird". The meaning of the words ''robin'' and ''bird'' are stored in the memory by virtue of a list of features which can be used to ultimately define their categories, although the extent of their association with a particular category varies.

==History==
This model was conceptualized by Edward Smith, Edward Shoben and Lance Rips in 1974 after they derived various observations from semantic verification experiments conducted at the time. Respondents merely have to answer "true" or "false" to given sentences. Out of these experiments, they observed that people respond faster when (1) statements are true, (2) nouns are members of smaller categories, (3) items are "typical" or commonly associated with the category (also called prototypes), and (4) items are primed by a similar item previously given ([[University of Alaska Anchorage]], n.d.). In the latter item, respondents will respond faster to the latter statement since the category bird has been primed. Based on the previous observations, the proponents were able to come up with the semantic feature comparison model.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

==Theory==
The cognitive approach consists of two concepts: [[information processing]] depends on [[Mental representation|internal representations]], and that mental representations undergo transformations. For the first concept, we could describe an object in a number of ways, with drawings, equations, or verbal descriptions, but it is up to the recipient to have a background understanding of the context to which the object is being described in order to fully comprehend the deliverable. The second concept explains how memory can alter the way we perceive representations of something, by determining the sequence in which the information is processed based on previous experiences.

==Features==
The main features of the model, as discussed by Smith et al. (1974), are the defining features and the characteristic features. Defining features refer to the characteristics that are essential elements of the category, the non-negotiable, so to speak. For example, the 'bird' category includes such defining features as 'they have wings', 'feathers', 'they lay eggs', etc. Characteristic features refer to the elements usually found or inherent to category members but are not found in all, or non-essentials. For example, birds 'fly', – that is characteristic because while most birds fly, there are some who cannot.

The model has two stages for [[decision making]]. First, all features of the two concepts (bird and robin, in our example) are compared to find out how alike they are. If the decision is that they are very [[similarity (psychology)|similar]] or very dissimilar, then a true or false decision can be made. Second, if the characteristics/features are in-between then the focus shifts to the defining features in order to decide if the example possesses enough features of the category, thus, categorization depends on similarity and not on the size of the category.

'''''The Big Bang''''' was a [[CITV]] science show broadcast from 15 April 1996 – 8 September 2004 and produced by [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]]. It is notable for being one of CITV's longest-running science programmes. The aim of the programme was to make science fun and interesting for children.

== History ==
Starting in 1996, ''The Big Bang'' was originally presented by [[Gareth Jones (presenter)|Gareth Jones]] and [[Kate Bellingham]]. Kate Bellingham left after the second series to care for her new child. Gareth Jones's long-time friend and now partner [[Violet Berlin]] was her replacement for the third series in 1998. The show essentially stayed the same before a new logo and set design was introduced for the fifth and sixth series in 2000 and 2001. Both Gareth and Violet left the show after the sixth series as they were, as said by ITV at the time, "concentrating on running their own company [WhizzBang] and looking after baby Indigo".&lt;ref name="The Big Bang official website 2002"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040208123229/http://granadakids.granadainteractive.com/bigbang/pres.html The Big Bang series 7 website, 'Presenters' page]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gareth Jones later revealed on his website that they left because "when we were asked to do the 2002 series it looked like many of the people who usually make the programme with us wouldn't be doing it any more. There were lots of changes planned for the Big Bang which Violet &amp; I didn't agree with, so we said thank you for the last 6 series and wished them all the luck for the future." &lt;ref name="Gareth Jones"&gt;[http://www.garethjones.tv/faqtext.html GarethJones.TV Faq, from question 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the seventh series the show had another rebrand, notably a new theme tune, the first since the beginning of the show, however the old theme tune was brought back for the final two series. There was also a new logo, and new presenters Kate McIntyre and Michael Underwood were introduced. The set stayed remained mainly unchanged, however the neon ''The Big Bang'' sign in the kitchen was not replaced with the new logo until series 8. Michael and Kate presented the show together for two series, until Michael left to present ''[[Ministry of Mayhem]]'', and for the ninth and last series he was replaced with [[Sam Pinkham]].

In 2003, a shorter 5-minute version of the show, ''The Little Bang'', was introduced at weekends. It took one section from a normal Big Bang episode and displayed what was needed for the make at the beginning of the show.

After the show ended, it was repeated daily on [[Discovery Kids (UK)|Discovery Kids UK]], who started showing it with the first series and all the way up until the sixth before the channel closed in 2007. Afterwards, series 7, 8 and 9{{Clarify|reason=structure|date=July 2017}} were regularly repeated on the [[CITV]] channel, normally at weekends until the end of 2012.

In Vietnam from 2003, all series of the show were originally aired on HTV7, later on HTV1 (public) and HTV4 (education &amp; science).

'''''The Chilling Stars''''' is a non-fiction book about the possible causes and effects of global [[climate change]] by [[Henrik Svensmark]] and [[Nigel Calder]]. The paperback version was published by Totem Books on March 19, 2003.&lt;ref name=lbr/&gt; An updated version titled '''''The Chilling Stars: A New Theory of Climate Change''''' was published in 2007. Svensmark is otherwise known as a Danish [[physicist]] and professor while Calder has worked as a [[Science journalism|science journalist]].

The authors argue that cloud cover changes caused by variations in [[cosmic rays]] are a major contributor to [[Temperature record|global temperature increases]], and they state that human influences have been exaggerated.&lt;ref name=lbr/&gt;

==Contents and background==
[[File:1000 Year Temperature Comparison.png|thumb|right|300px|This graph depicts several estimates of [[Temperature record|world temperature variation]] over the last millennium.]]

The authors describe a cross-disciplinary theory that takes in elements of cosmology, particle physics, paleo-climatology, and meteorology. They label their concept 'cosmoclimatology', and they attempt to look back through prior climate trends such as the [[Medieval Warm Period]] and the [[Little Ice Age]]. They detail what they view as a close correlation between the rate of cosmic rays reaching the earth, which vary based on electromagnetic fluctuation on the sun's surface, and earth's temperature.&lt;ref name=lbr/&gt;

They write how the solar magnetic field grew over twice as strong as before over the 20th century, and they peg this as a primary driver of the approximately 0.6 [[Celsius|°C]] warming over that time. Specifically, they state that fewer cosmic rays cause fewer clouds to form and thus the climate becomes hotter, given that the individual water droplets that make up clouds collect when cosmic particles turn water into ions.

==Reviews==
[[File:HenrikSvensmark.jpg|thumb|right|Henrik Svensmark]]

The online magazine [http://www.londonbookreview.com/ londonbookreview.com] remarked, "For those who believe that the argument about the causes of climate change have been settled may find this a difficult book to read. But those who retain an open mind may find this an interesting read, even if it is only to confirm that the science is far from being settled."&lt;ref name=lbr&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[http://www.londonbookreview.com/ londonbookreview.com]|url=http://www.londonbookreview.com/lbr0037.html|title=The Chilling Stars|accessdate=August 26, 2011|date=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have generally not found the published work of Svensmark et al. persuasive. For example Lockwood et al. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-012-9181-3?null|title=Solar Influence on Global and Regional Climates|author=Mike Lockwood|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|date=July 2012|volume=33|issue=3|pages=503-534}}&lt;/ref&gt; find that "The cloud-cosmic ray suggestion increasingly fails to match observations". A joint Spanish/Japanese collaboration of solar ray/astrophysics experts found that the change in global cloud cover is closely correlated with [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] and uncorrelated with solar rays. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00306.1 |title=A Decade of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer: Is a Solar–Cloud Link Detectable? |first=Benjamin |last=Laken |first2=Enric |last2=Palle |first3=Hiroko |last3=Miyahara |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=25 |publisher=American Meteorological Society |year=2012 |doi=10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00306.1 |pages=4430-4440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mysteries of Nature and Art''''' is a book by John Bate written in 1634. The book acts as a practical guide for amateur scientific experiments, and is divided into four sections: '''Water Workes''', '''Fyer Workes''', '''Drawing, Colouring, Painting and Engraving''', and '''Divers Experiments'''.&lt;ref name="brooke-hitching"&gt;Edward Brooke-Hitching.

'''The Old Malthouse School''' (The '''OMH''') was a [[Preparatory School (UK)|preparatory school]] in the [[village]] of [[Langton Matravers]] near [[Swanage]] in the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Dorset]], [[United Kingdom]].

The school was founded in 1906 by Rex Corbett, an ex-England [[Football(soccer)|football]] player, and started with ten pupils in a building that was formerly a [[brewery]]. Tom Pellatt, his [[brother-in-law]] who ran [[Durnford School]] at Durnford Court in the same village had blasted out a swimming bath in the rocks at [[Dancing Ledge]], a mile and a half away on the coast and the pupils of both schools used this daily in the [[summer term]]. Durnford's most famous former pupil is [[Ian Fleming]], author of the [[James Bond]] novels and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (novel)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''.

In 1939, the [[school]] was sold by Corbett to Victor Haggard (H) and Evan Hope-Gill (Hopper) who inherited 37 boys. Durnford was requisitioned by the army later that year and the Durnford boys transferred to the Old Malthouse. Durnford was acquired by the owners of the Old Malthouse when the army gave it up in 1948. The main buildings were variously pulled down or sold, leaving the OMH with the grounds, which were levelled for playing fields. A third joint headmaster Peter Mattinson (Mr Matt) joined after [[World War II]] and the [[triumvirate]] ruled until 1974 when the school, then with about 80 boys, was sold to a Trust under the headmastership of Quintin Ambler. Ill-health led to Mr Ambler's early departure to be replaced as headmaster by Patrick Jordan in 1975 who expanded the school by adding a pre-prep department in the early 1980s. In 1988, Jon Phillips took over as [[Headmaster]], remaining for 15 years. During this time the school  became fully [[co-educational]]. Richard Keeble became [[Headmaster]] in January 2004 and left the school in July 2006 handing over the reins to longtime deputy Dr Moira Laffey. Through the 1970s and early 80s the school expanded to about 100 pupils but declining enrollment and increasing losses led to the decision to close the school in 2007. 

In April 2007, the local press reported that the school would close at the end of the 2007 summer term

A '''tide dial''', also known as a '''mass'''{{sfnp|Cook|2012}} or '''scratch dial''',{{sfnp|Horne|1929}}{{sfnp|Cole|1935}} is a [[sundial]] marked with the [[canonical hours]] rather than or in addition to the standard [[hour]]s of [[daylight]]. Such sundials were particularly common between the 7th and 14th centuries in [[Europe]], at which point they began to be replaced by mechanical [[clock]]s. There are more than 3,000 surviving tide dials in England and at least 1,500 in France.

==Name==
The name ''tide dial'' preserves the [[Old English]] term ''{{lang|ang|[[wikt:tid#Old English|tīd]]}}'', used for [[hour]]s and [[canonical hours]] prior to the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]], after which the [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]] ''hour'' gradually replaced it. The actual Old English name for sundials was ''{{lang|ang|{{linktext|dægmæl}}}}'' or "day-marker".

==History==

[[File:Musee-de-l-Oeuvre-Notre-Dame-Strasbourg-IMG 4024.jpg|thumb|200px|The {{c.|1240}} tide dial in Strasbourg]]
[[History of Judaism|Jews]] long recited [[Jewish prayer|prayers]] at fixed times of day. [[Psalm 119]] in particular mentions praising [[Jewish God|God]] seven times a day,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+119&amp;version=CJB Ps. 119:164].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rule&gt;{{citation |title=''Rule of Benedict'' |at=[http://www.osb.org/rb/text/rbefjo2.html#16 Ch. 16] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[apostle]]s [[Peter (apostle)|Peter]] and [[John (apostle)|John]] are mentioned attending afternoon prayers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+3%3A1&amp;version=KJV Acts 3:1].&lt;/ref&gt; Christian communities initially followed numerous local traditions with regard to prayer, but [[Charlemagne]] compelled his subjects to follow the [[Roman liturgy]] and his son [[Louis the Pious]] imposed the [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Rule]] of [[Benedict of Nursia|St{{nbsp}}Benedict]] upon their religious communities. 

The [[canonical hours]] adopted by Benedict and imposed by the [[Franks|Frankish]] kings were the [[Night Office]] (Nocturns) said in the wee hours,{{efn|Specifically, the Night Office usually occurred as near the 8th hour of night (⅔ of the way between sunset and sunrise) as could be reckoned between [[November 1]] and [[Easter]] and immediately prior to the Morning Office during the rest of the year, with the abbot charged to organize services so as to permit the monks time to visit the [[reredorter|toilet]] between the two services.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=''Rule of Benedict'' |at=[http://www.osb.org/rb/text/rbefjo1.html#chap8 Ch. 8] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sunday services being longer, they necessarily began somewhat earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=''Rule of Benedict'' |at=[http://www.osb.org/rb/text/rbefjo2.html#11 Ch. 11] }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} the [[Morning Office]] (Matins or [[Lauds]]) in the dawn just prior to sunrise, [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]] after the 1st hour of sunlight, [[Terce]] at the 3rd, [[Sext]] at the 6th, [[Nones (liturgy)|Nones]] at the 9th,&lt;ref name=rule/&gt; [[Vespers]] at sunset,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=''Rule of Benedict'' |at=[http://www.osb.org/rb/text/rbemjo2.html#41 Ch. 41] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Compline]] after a period of rest and reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=''Rule of Benedict'' |at=[http://www.osb.org/rb/text/rbemjo2.html#42 Ch. 42 ] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Monks were called to these hours by their abbot&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=''Rule of Benedict'' |at=[http://www.osb.org/rb/text/rbemjo3.html#47 Ch. 47] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; or by the ringing of the [[church bell]], with the time between services organized in reading the [[Bible]] or other religious texts, in manual labor, or in sleep.

The need for these monastic communities and others to organize their times of prayer prompted the establishment of tide dials built into the walls of churches. They began to be used in England in the late 7th century and spread from there across continental Europe through copies of [[Venerable Bede|Bede]]'s works and by the [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Saxon]] and [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]s. Within England, tide dials fell out of favor after the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref name="Mass"&gt;{{citation |title=Pastfinders |url=http://pastfinders.com |contribution-url=http://pastfinders.com/sundials.htm |contribution=Tide, Mass or Scratch Dials }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century, some tide dials—like that at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]—were constructed as independent statues rather than built into the walls of the churches. From the 14th century onwards, the [[cathedral]]s and other large churches began to use mechanical [[clock]]s and the canonical sundials lost their utility, except in small [[local church|rural churches]], where they remained in use until the 16th century.
 
There are more than 3,000 surviving tide dials in England&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/dials_menu/mass-dials/ |contribution=Mass Dials |title=''Official site'' |url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/ |publisher=British Sundial Society }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[T.W. Cole|Cole]] gives a list of 1300 English churches with tide dials.{{sfnp|Cole|1935|pp=10-16}}}} and at least 1,500 in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Denis |last=Schneider |contribution=Les Cadrans Canoniaux |title=L'Astronomie, ''No. 76'' |date=2014 |pp=58-61 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in [[Normandy]], [[Touraine]], [[Charente]], and at monasteries along the [[Camino de Santiago|pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostella]] in northwestern Spain.

==Design==
With [[Christendom]] confined to the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the tide dials were often carved vertically onto the south side of the church [[chancel]] at eye level near the [[priest's door]]. In an abbey or large monastery, dials were carefully carved into the stone walls, while in rural churches they were very often just scratched onto the wall.

Some tide dials have a stone [[gnomon]], but many have a circular hole which is used to hold a more easily replaced or adjusted wooden gnomon. These gnomons were perpendicular to the wall and cast a shadow upon the dial, a semicircle divided into a number of equal sectors. Most dials have supplementary lines marking the other 8 daytime hours, but are characterized by their noting the canonical hours particularly. The lines for the canonical hours may be longer or marked with a dot or cross. The divisions are seldom numbered.

Dials often have holes along the circumference of their semicircle. As additional gnomons were needless and these holes are often quite shallow, [[T.W. Cole|Cole]] suggests they were used to quickly and easily reconstruct the tide dials following a fresh [[whitewash]] of the church walls with chalk or lime.{{sfnp|Cole|1935|pp=2-3}}

==Examples==

===Bewcastle Cross===
{{main|Bewcastle Cross}}
The oldest surviving [[England|English]] tide dial is on the 7th- or 8th-century [[Bewcastle Cross]] in the church graveyard of St Cuthbert's in [[Bewcastle]], [[Cumbria]]. It is carved on the south face of a Celtic cross at some height from the ground and is divided by five principal lines into four tides. Two of these lines, those for 9{{nbsp}}am and noon, are crossed at the point. The four spaces are further subdivided so as to give the twelve daylight [[hour#History|hours]] of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. On one side of the dial, there is a vertical line which touches the semicircular border at the second afternoon hour. This may be an accident, but the same kind of line is found on the dial in the crypt of [[Bamburgh]] Church, where it marks a later hour of the day. The sundial may have been used for calculating the date of the spring [[equinox]] and hence [[Easter]].&lt;ref name ="Bewcastle"&gt;''Bewcastle: A Brief Historical Sketch''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Repath"&gt;"Bilberries and Tickled Trout: Reflections on the Bewcastle Cross".&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Nendrum Sundial===
{{main|Nendrum Monastery}}
[[Nendrum Monastery]] in [[Northern Ireland]], supposedly founded in the 5th century by [[St&amp;nbsp;Machaoi]], now has a reconstructed tide dial.&lt;ref name="Nendrum"&gt;{{citation |title=Department of the Environment |url=http://www.ni-environment.gov.uk/ |contribution-url=http://www.ni-environment.gov.uk/nendrum.htm |contribution=Nendrum Monastic Site |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416081945/http://www.ni-environment.gov.uk/ |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 9th-century tide dial gives the name of its sculptor and a priest.

===Kirkdale Sundial===
The 1056{{nbsp}}{{abbr|x|sometime between}} 1065 tide dial at St Gregory's Minster in [[Kirkdale, North Yorkshire|Kirkdale]], [[North Yorkshire]], has four principal divisions marked by five crossed lines, subdivided by single lines. One marking ¼ of the way between sunrise and noon is an incised cross that would indicate about 9 am at midwinter and 6 am at midsummer. It was dedicated to a "Hawarth".&lt;ref name="Wall2"&gt;{{harvp|Wall|1912|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Wallace "Wally" Funk''' (born February 1, 1939) is an [[United States|American]] [[aviator]] and [[Goodwill Ambassador]]. She was one of the [[Mercury 13]], and was the first female air safety investigator for the [[National Transportation Safety Board]], the first civilian [[flight instructor]] at [[Fort Sill, Oklahoma]], and the first [[Federal Aviation Agency]] inspector.&lt;ref name=Stolley/&gt;

==Early life and education==

Funk was born in [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]] in 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DuLvAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22****FAA+Inspector+for+SWAP.+Home:+655+8th+Pl.,+Hermosa+Beach.+Calif.+Born+Feb.+1,+1939,+Las+Vegas,+N.M.+Other+Activities%22&amp;dq=%22****FAA+Inspector+for+SWAP.+Home:+655+8th+Pl.,+Hermosa+Beach.+Calif.+Born+Feb.+1,+1939,+Las+Vegas,+N.M.+Other+Activities%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYxo-i2OXQAhUT4mMKHcSLCZYQ6AEIGjAA|title=Who's who in Aviation|date=13 October 1973|publisher=Harwood &amp; Charles Publishing Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Taos, New Mexico]]. Her parents owned a [[variety store]]. The family had a collection of artwork from artists at the [[Taos art colony]]. The artists would trade artwork to pay off their [[debt]] at the store. When Funk was four years old, she jumped off the roof of a [[barn]] in a [[Superman]] costume. She thought the costume would make her fly instead of falling into a [[haystack]].&lt;ref name=Stolley/&gt; She did her first solo [[flight]] at age 16 and enrolled in the aviation program at [[Stephens College]], which she completed first in her class in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/female-aviation-pioneer-to-share-her-fervor-for-flight-at/article_c7dea103-277c-526b-b09a-2e32cd4a70d8.html|title=Female aviation pioneer to share her fervor for flight at Stephens College|last=Hackel|first=Karee|website=Columbia Missourian|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, she completed a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in Secondary Education at [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]], along with additional [[aviation]] instrumentation and instruction ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ninety-nines.org/wally-funk.htm|title=Advancing Women Pilots {{!}} Women Pilots Today {{!}} Wally Funk (The...|last=Inc.|first=The Ninety-Nines,|website=The Ninety-Nines, Inc.|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 20 years old, Funk became a professional aviator.&lt;ref name=WA1/&gt;

==Mercury 13==

{{Main|Mercury 13}}

Funk always wanted to be an [[astronaut]].&lt;ref name=WA1&gt;{{cite web|title=Wally Funk|url=http://womenaviators.org/WallyFunk.html|publisher=Women Aviators|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She volunteered to be a part of the [[Women in Space Program]] in 1961, becoming one of the [[Mercury 13]].&lt;ref name=WA1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Carol L.|title=Wally Funk Oral History Interview|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/291543-1|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other participants in the program, Funk was put through rigorous [[Physical fitness|physical]] and mental testing. In one test, volunteers were placed in [[sensory deprivation tank]]s. Funk was in the tank, without [[hallucinating]], for 10 hours and 35 minutes, a record. She passed her tests and was qualified to go into space. She scored higher than [[John Glenn]] did in his testing and was the third best in the [[Mercury 13]] program. Despite this, the program was canceled before the women were to undergo their last test.&lt;ref name=WA1/&gt;

==After Mercury 13==

After the Mercury 13 program was canceled, Funk became a [[Goodwill Ambassador]], flying over 80,000 miles throughout the world. She earned the rating of [[flight instructor]] in the United States, from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA).&lt;ref name=WA1/&gt; At [[Fort Sill, Oklahoma]], she became the first non-military flight instructor.&lt;ref name=Stolley/&gt; She was the first woman to finish the FAA General Aviation Operations Inspector Academy, which she finished in 1971. She became an [[Flight inspection|Air Safety Investigator]] for the [[National Transportation Safety Board]], in 1974. She was the first woman to be given the title.&lt;ref name=WA1/&gt; In 1995, [[Eileen Collins]] became the first woman to pilot a [[space shuttle]] into space; Funk was too old to qualify to become a space shuttle pilot by the time Collins became one.&lt;ref name=Stolley/&gt;

==Today==

She has over 19,000 flight hours.&lt;ref name=Stolley/&gt; She has taught over 3,000 students how to fly.&lt;ref name=Stolley/&gt;&lt;ref name=WA1/&gt; Funk has continued to [[dream]] of going to [[space]]. In 2012, she put money down to be one of the first people to fly into space via [[Virgin Galactic]]. The money for the flight came from Funk's own book and film [[royalties]] and family money. She learned how to fly a [[Black Hawk helicopter]] in 2012. She lives in [[Roanoke, Texas]].&lt;ref name=Stolley&gt;{{cite news|last=Stolley|first=Richard B.|title=Woman in Space: The Long-Delayed Flight of Wally Funk |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2112251,00.html|work=U.S.|publisher=Time|accessdate=16 June 2013|date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10255">'''Website localization''' is the process of adapting an existing website to local language and culture in the [[target market]].&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/10/08/culture-and-website-localization|title=Culture and Website Localization|last=Payne|first=Neil|date=8 October 2004|work=[[WebProNews]]|accessdate=29 November 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uaaxzK3s|archivedate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the process of adapting a website into a different linguistic and cultural context&lt;ref name=SANDRINI&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandrini|first=Peter|title=Website Localization and Translation|journal=MuTra 2005 – Challenges of Multidimensional Translation: Conference Proceedings|series=EU-High-Level Scientific Conference Series|issue=131-138|url=http://www.translationconcepts.org/pdf/MuTra_2005_Proceedings.pdf#page=135|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;— involving much more than the simple translation of text. This modification process must reflect specific language and cultural preferences in the content, images and overall design and requirements of the site – all while maintaining the integrity of the website.  Culturally adapted web sites reduce the amount of required cognitive efforts from visitors of the site to process information, making navigation easier and attitudes toward the web site more favorable.&lt;ref name="Shneor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shneor|first=Rotem|date=2014-02-28|title=Influences of culture, geography, and infrastructure on website localization|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1034102170?accountid=14667|journal=Cross Cultural Management|volume=19|issue=3|pages=352–374|access-date=2017-12-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modification of the website must additionally take into consideration the stated purpose of the new website with a focus on the targeted audience/market in the new locale.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI/&gt; Website localization aims to customize a website so that it seems "natural", to its viewers despite cultural differences between the creators and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shneor|first=Rodem|title=Influences of culture, geography and infrastructure on website localization decisions|journal=Cross Cultural Management: An International Journal|date=2012|volume=19|issue=3|pages=352–374|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=17047475|accessdate=19 March 2014|doi=10.1108/13527601211247099}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two factors are involved—programming expertise and linguistic/cultural knowledge.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

The proliferation of website localization is the result of the popularity of computer and Internet users. People all over the world treat the Internet as their main location for information and services. These people do not all speak the same language. As a result, website localization has become one of the primary tools for business global expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website Localization|url=https://asianabsolute.co.uk/website-localization|publisher=Asian Absolute|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to website communication across multiple cultures for multiple needs, the Internet has given way to non professional translation practices. Because website localization involves mixed strategies, organizations tend to maintain a global image while using website localization to appeal to local users.&lt;ref name="Pym"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199239306.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199239306-e-028|title = Oxford Handbooks|last=Pym|first=Anthony|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge of website localization has become even more important as websites increasingly have the potential to both supplement and replace presence in foreign markets.  As web design becomes more congruent with national culture, it will foster online consumer purchasing.&lt;ref name="Shneor"/&gt; Creators take into account the "language, education level, belief and value systems, [and] traditions and habits" of the target culture in order to optimize results.&lt;ref name=Shneor /&gt;

==Process==
Website localization is more than mere [[translation]].&lt;ref name="Tan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-08-06/business/0108060190_1_localization-translation-web-sites|title=Translators go beyond language as Web sites cross borders|last=Tan|first=Shannon|date=6 August 2001|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=29 November 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uabN4muG|archivedate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translating only solves partial language problems. Measurement units must be converted; images and text are modified to appeal to the target culture.&lt;ref name="Tan"/&gt;

The process of website localization is complex and involves three different levels of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Localization?|url=http://www.gx-localizations.com/about.asp|publisher=GX Localizations|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First is translation. Website localization involves adapting any text being used into the language of the country. It is important that translation of information be “clear and understandable” to avoid cultural misunderstanding or offense.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; In order to translate, the "target culture" must be known.&lt;ref name="Stanley 1999 127–129"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=John|title=SIGDOC '99 Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Computer documentation|year=1999|publisher=ACM|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-58113-072-4|pages=127–129|url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/320000/318569/p127-stanley.pdf?ip=141.213.236.110&amp;id=318569&amp;acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&amp;key=B5D9E165A72B697C%2E0A17827594E6F2C8%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;CFID=419590667&amp;CFTOKEN=40207095&amp;__acm__=1394480330_f23b71ce60f010c26de5d84eebbfbb5b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second is the actual localization, which includes translation but also involves all other efforts and activities to ensure that the adaptation of textual materials, visual displays, illustrations and graphics are “linguistically and culturally appropriate for the target locale.” &lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; Target locale is understood as the “[[Market segmentation|market segment]] defined by criteria including language, currency, and perhaps educational level or income bracket.” &lt;ref name=PYM&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pym|first=Anthony|title=Website localization|year=2011|url=http://usuaris.tinet.cat/apym/on-line/translation/2009_website_localization.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many technical elements which can be localized are: date and time formats, currency formats, number formats, address and telephone number formats, units of measure and connection speed.&lt;ref name=PYM /&gt; In order to ensure effective communication during the localization process, it is important to consider the following items: [[information architecture]], theme and navigation, [[graphics]], photographs, audio, and visual.&lt;ref name="Stanley 1999 127–129"/&gt; Third is [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]], which involves making sure that the software being used is fully compatible with the technology of the country in question.

There are two important considerations to keep in mind during the process of website localization. The first is to focus on the demands of the user.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; The readers of the “localized version of the website” want to be able to read and understand the pages in a way that makes sense to them.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;  A second consideration is to take into account the goals of the client, whether an institution, government or individual, for example.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;

==Backend localization==
Many elements of a website that are different according to the locale of the client need only minor manual changes by a localizer, or none at all. For example, the system on which the website is created should automatically produce the correct currency symbol based on the country in which the client is located.&lt;ref name=LAKO&gt;{{cite web|last=Lako|first=Cristian|title=The Elements of the Website Localizations Process|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1321921734/abstract?accountid=14667|work=Studia Universitatis Petru Major. Philogia|publisher=Universitatea Petru Maior|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Website Analytics Software:&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt; This software can be created once generally, and then applied to each of the localized domains.
* Site Search: Results can be reviewed using an algorithm that sifts through possible results using [[metadata]]. For example, a consumer who makes a query in the United States should not be shown a good that can only be purchased in Portugal.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;
* Testimonials: Comments and feedback are often a vital part of a website. Localization efforts usually only include censorship. This can be done largely by software, however human review is sometimes necessary.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;
* Information Storage: [[Databases]] are often used to store large amounts of information. They can be used to store generic data, like product information, as well as more specific information pertaining to certain locales.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;

==The business of website localization==
Using website localization to its best advantage is vital to any business seeking to move into international markets. With more and more companies seeking to tap into these lucrative markets, website localization has become quite profitable.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;  The business side involves global and local coordination; production and operations, including finance; sales and marketing; language translation, including technology and linguistic coordination; software engineering, as well as design.&lt;ref name=PYM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wandrianne|first=Dias|title=The Business Behind Translation|url=http://www.ccaps.net/blog/the-business-behind-translation/|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The higher the technological abilities of the target culture, the more likely it is for website localization to be implemented and used effectively.&lt;ref name=Shneor /&gt;

The "'''Well to Hell'''" is an [[urban legend]] regarding a putative [[borehole]] in [[Russia]] which was purportedly drilled so deep that it broke through into [[Hell]]. This [[urban legend]] has been circulating on the [[Internet]] since at least 1995. It is first attested in English as a 1989 broadcast by a U.S. domestic [[religion]]-based TV broadcaster, [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]].

==Legend and basis==
The legend holds that a team of Russian engineers purportedly led by an individual named "Mr. Azakov" in an unnamed place in [[Siberia]] had drilled a hole that was {{convert|14.4|km|mi}} deep before breaking through to a cavity. Intrigued by this unexpected discovery, they lowered an extremely heat-tolerant [[microphone]], along with other sensory equipment, into the well. The temperature deep within was {{convert|1000|C|F|-3}}—heat from a chamber of fire from which (purportedly) the tormented screams of the damned could be heard. However, the recording was later found to be looped together from various sound effects, sometimes identified as the soundtrack of the 1972 movie ''[[Baron Blood (film)|Baron Blood]]''.&lt;ref name=Skeptoid&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4307|number=307|title=The Siberian Hell Sounds|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] had, in fact, drilled a hole more than {{convert|12|km|mi}} deep, the [[Kola Superdeep Borehole]], located not in Siberia but on the [[Kola Peninsula]], which shares borders with [[Norway]] and [[Finland]]. Upon reaching the depth of {{convert|12,262|m}} in 1989, some interesting geological anomalies were found, although they reported no supernatural encounters.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/religion/wellhell.asp |title=The Well to Hell |last1=Mikkelson |first1=Barbara |last2= |first2= |date=9 January 2016 |website=[[Snopes]] |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propagation==
The story was reported to first have been published by the Finnish newspaper ''Ammennusastia'', a journal published by a group of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[Christianity|Christians]] from [[Leväsjoki]], a village in the municipality of [[Siikainen]] in [[Western Finland Province|Western Finland]]. [[Rich Buhler]], who interviewed the editors, found that the story had been based on recollections of a letter printed in the feature section of a newspaper called ''Etelä Soumen'' (possibly the ''[[Etelä-Suomen Sanomat]]''). When contacting the letter's author, Buhler found that he had drawn from a story appearing in a Finnish Christian newsletter named ''Vaeltajat'', which had printed the story in July 1989. The newsletter's editor claimed that its origin had been a newsletter called ''Jewels of Jericho'', published by a group of [[Messianic Jews]] in [[California]]. Here, Buhler stopped tracing the origins any further.&lt;ref name=buhler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/d/drilltohellfacts.htm|title=Background on the Drilling to Hell story|accessdate=2013-11-22|work=Rich Buhler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States|American]] [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]] soon ran the story, and sound files began appearing on various sites across the [[Internet]]. Sensationalistic retellings of the legend can be found on YouTube, usually featuring the aforementioned ''Baron Blood'' sound effects.

===TBN involvement===
The story eventually made its way to the American Christian [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] (TBN), which broadcast it on the network, claiming it to be proof of the [[Biblical literalism|literal]] existence of hell.

Åge Rendalen, a [[Norway|Norwegian]] teacher, heard the story on TBN while visiting the United States. Disgusted with what he perceived to be mass gullibility, Rendalen decided to augment the tale at TBN's expense.&lt;ref name=truth&gt;[http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/d/drilltohellfacts.htm Interview with Åge Rendalen by Rich Buhler]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rendalen wrote to the network, originally claiming that he disbelieved the tale but, upon his return to Norway, supposedly read a factual account of the story.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; According to Rendalen, the story claimed not only that the cursed well was real, but that a [[bat]]-like apparition (a common pictorial representation of [[demon]]s, such as in [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Torment of Saint Anthony]]'' or the more recent [[Bat Boy (character)|Bat Boy]] by ''[[Weekly World News]]'') had risen out of it before blazing a trail across the Russian sky.&lt;ref name=truth/&gt; To perpetuate his hoax, Rendalen deliberately mistranslated a trivial Norwegian article about a local building inspector into the story, and submitted both the original Norwegian article and the English "translation" to TBN. Rendalen also included his real name, phone number and address, as well as those of a pastor friend who knew about the hoax and had agreed to expose it to anyone who called seeking verification.&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

However, TBN did nothing to verify Rendalen's claims, and aired the story as proof of the validity of the original story.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;

==Alternate versions==
Since its publicity, many alternative versions of the Well to Hell story have been published.&lt;ref name=Skeptoid /&gt; In 1992, the U.S. tabloid ''[[Weekly World News]]'' published an alternative version of the story, which was set in Alaska where 13 miners were killed after [[Satan]] came roaring out of hell.&lt;ref name=snopes /&gt;&lt;ref name="WWN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weeklyworldnews.com/headlines/3060/oil-drill-opens-hole-into-hell/|title=Oil Drill Opens Hole Into Hell|publisher=Weekly World News|accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1040">'''Wilhelm Phillip Daniel Schulz''' (6 March 1805 – 1 August 1877), also known as '''Guillermo Schulz''', was a German [[mine engineer]] and [[geologist]] who spent most of his professional life in Spain. He was born in [[Dörnberg]] and died in [[Aranjuez]].

==Career==
In 1826 Schulz went to Spain, and shortly was hired by the Spanish Government to enhance the mining industry in the country. In 1833 he was appointed Mining Inspector for [[Asturias]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and in 1844 General Mining Inspector for Asturias. It was in Asturias where, for many years, he carried out outstanding geological and industrial work which he made public in several books. In 1854 he moved to [[Madrid]], where he taught in the Mining Engineering School and was vice-president of the Geological Institute.

In [[control theory]] the '''Youla–Kučera parametrization''' (also simply known as '''Youla [[parametrization]]''') is a formula that describes all possible stabilizing feedback controllers for a given plant P, as function of a single parameter Q.

==Details==
The YK parametrization is a general result. It is a fundamental result of control theory and launched an entirely new area of research and found application, among others, in optimal and robust control.&lt;ref&gt;V. Kučera. A Method to Teach the Parameterization of All Stabilizing Controllers. 18th IFAC World Congress. Italy, Milan, 2011.[http://www.nt.ntnu.no/users/skoge/prost/proceedings/ifac11-proceedings/data/html/papers/1148.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

For ease of understanding and as suggested by Kučera it is best described for three increasingly general kinds of plant.

===Stable SISO Plant===

Let &lt;math&gt;P(s)&lt;/math&gt; be a transfer function of a stable [[Single-input single-output system]] (SISO) system. Further, let Ω be a set of stable and proper functions of ''s''. Then, the set of all proper stabilizing controllers for the plant &lt;math&gt;P(s)&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as

&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \frac{Q(s)}{1 - P(s)Q(s)}, Q(s)\in \Omega \right\}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;Q(s)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary proper and stable function of ''s''. It can be said, that &lt;math&gt;Q(s)&lt;/math&gt; parametrizes all stabilizing controllers for the plant &lt;math&gt;P(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

===General SISO Plant===

Consider a general plant with a transfer function &lt;math&gt;P(s)&lt;/math&gt;. Further, the transfer function can be factorized as

&lt;math&gt;P(s)=\frac{N(s)}{M(s)}&lt;/math&gt;, where M(s), N(s) are stable and proper functions of ''s''.

Now, solve the [[Bézout's identity]] of the form

'''&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{N(s)X(s)} + \mathbf{M(s)Y(s)} = \mathbf{1} &lt;/math&gt;''',

where the variables to be found (X(s), Y(s)) must be also proper and stable.

After proper and stable X, Y were found, we can define one stabilizing controller that is of the form &lt;math&gt;C(s)=\frac{X(s)}{Y(s)}&lt;/math&gt;. After we have one stabilizing controller at hand, we can define all stabilizing controllers using a parameter Q(s) that is proper and stable. The set of all stabilizing controllers is defined as

&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \frac{X(s)+M(s)Q(s)}{Y(s) - N(s)Q(s)}, Q(s) \in \Omega \right\}&lt;/math&gt;,

===General MIMO plant===

In a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, consider a transfer matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P(s)}&lt;/math&gt;. It can be factorized using right coprime factors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P(s)=N(s)D^{-1}(s)}&lt;/math&gt;  or left factors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P(s)=\tilde{D}^{-1}(s)\tilde{N}(s)}&lt;/math&gt;. The factors must be proper, stable and doubly coprime, which ensures that the system '''P'''(s) is controllable and observable. This can be written by Bézout identity of the form

&lt;math&gt;
\left[ \begin{matrix}
   \mathbf{X} &amp; \mathbf{Y}  \\
   -\mathbf{\tilde{N}} &amp; {\mathbf{\tilde{D}}}  \\
\end{matrix} \right]\left[ \begin{matrix}
   \mathbf{D} &amp; -\mathbf{\tilde{Y}}  \\
   \mathbf{N} &amp; {\mathbf{\tilde{X}}}  \\
\end{matrix} \right]=\left[ \begin{matrix}
   \mathbf{I} &amp; 0  \\
   0 &amp; \mathbf{I}  \\
\end{matrix} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;.

After finding &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X, Y, \tilde{X}, \tilde{Y}}&lt;/math&gt; that are stable and proper, we can define the set of all stabilizing controllers '''K(s)''' using left or right factor, provided having negative feedback.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  &amp; \mathbf{K(s)}={{\left( \mathbf{X}-\mathbf{\Delta\tilde{N}} \right)}^{-1}}\left( \mathbf{Y}+\mathbf{\Delta\tilde{D}} \right) \\ 
 &amp; =\left( \mathbf{\tilde{Y}}+\mathbf{D\Delta} \right){{\left( \mathbf{\tilde{X}}-\mathbf{N\Delta} \right)}^{-1}}  
\end{align}

&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary stable and proper parameter. 

Let &lt;math&gt;P(s)&lt;/math&gt; be the transfer function of the plant and let &lt;math&gt;K_0(s)&lt;/math&gt; be a stabilizing controller.  Let their right coprime factorizations be:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P(s)}= \mathbf{N} \mathbf{M}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K_0(s)} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
then '''all''' stabilizing controllers can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K(s)} = (\mathbf{U}+\mathbf{M} \mathbf{Q}) (\mathbf{V}+\mathbf{N} \mathbf{Q})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; 
where Q is stable and proper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/cellier/Lect/NMC/Lect_nmc_index.html Cellier: Lecture Notes on Numerical Methods for control, Ch. 24]&lt;/ref&gt;


The engineering significance of the YK formula is that if one wants to find a stabilizing controller that meets some additional criterion, one can adjust Q such that the desired criterion is met.
