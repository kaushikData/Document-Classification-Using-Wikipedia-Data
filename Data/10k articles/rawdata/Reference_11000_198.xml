The '''ASHRAE Handbook''' is the four-volume [[Flagship (disambiguation)|flagship]] publication of the nonprofit technical organization '''[[ASHRAE]]''' (formerly '''American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers''').  This [[Handbook]] is considered the practical repository of knowledge on the various topics that form the field of heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration ([[HVAC|HVAC&amp;R]]).

The four volumes are ''Fundamentals'', ''Refrigeration'', ''HVAC Applications'' ("Applications"), and ''HVAC Systems and Equipment'' ("Systems and Equipment").  Members of ASHRAE receive the current volume, in both print and [[CD-ROM]] form, each year as a basic membership benefit.  An enhanced electronic version, known as ''ASHRAE Handbook Online'' is a web-based version updated annually that contains the four latest volumes as well as extra content such as calculations, demonstration videos, and spreadsheets.  The various versions of the Handbook are typically available to the public via technical, and other, libraries and bookstores.

==History==

The ASHRAE Handbook has had a variety of titles.&lt;ref&gt;"The ASHRAE Centennial: 100 Years of Progress", ASHRAE Historical Committee, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  It began in 1922 as the '''ASH&amp;VE Guide'''.  In 1973 it became the ASHRAE Handbook, and in 1985 separate publication of inch-pound ([[United States customary units|I-P]]) and international system ([[SI]]) units versions of the volumes began.  The current [[publisher of record]] is W. Stephen Comstock, and the Editor is Mark S. Owen.  The Handbook is published by ASHRAE from its headquarters in [[Atlanta]], Georgia.

==Review and Revision==

The Handbook's content is created and modified by volunteers via ASHRAE's many Technical Committees (TCs), and then edited and formatted by professional staff at ASHRAE.  For example, three chapters, in three different volumes, are maintained by TC 5.3, Room Air Distribution.  Each chapter within a particular volume is reviewed and revised in a repeating four-year cycle; one volume is printed each year.&lt;ref&gt;"ASHRAE Handbook Authors and Revisers Guide", ASHRAE Inc., August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In the summer of 2017 the new Fundamentals volume was released.  ASHRAE's Handbook Committee maintains an ''Authors and Revisers Guide'' which can be obtained freely via the Handbook portion of the ASHRAE Web site.

While each new or revised chapter manuscript is to be reviewed for technical content by each TC voting and corresponding member before publication, there are often many other pre- and post-publication reviewers.  For example, members of the Society's Handbook Committee and the College of Fellows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashraecof.org/Handbook/HandbookReport2008.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704165122/http://www.ashraecof.org/Handbook/HandbookReport2008.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }} , accessed May 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; review chapters each year.  Reviews, from basic comments to detailed new content, are encouraged from all users of the Handbook and may be submitted through an on-line commenting system.

'''''A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia''''' was first published in 1980 by [[William Collins, Sons|Collins]], Sydney.  It was authored by [[Graham Pizzey]] with illustrations by Roy B. Doyle.  The first edition was issued in [[octavo]] format, 220&amp;nbsp;mm in height by 140&amp;nbsp;mm width, with a [[foreword]] by [[Dominic Louis Serventy|Dr D.L. Serventy]].  It contained 460 pages of text with 32 [[black-and-white]] and 56 colour plates illustrating nearly all species of birds recorded in Australia at the time of publication.  The plates were bunched between pages 300 and 301, while there were 725 maps of breeding distribution on pages 411-442 between the main text and the indexes, as well as maps of Australia in the end papers.&lt;ref&gt;Pizzey (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;  Its success was such that it was followed by several further editions.

==History==
In the preface to the seventh edition, Sue, Caroline, Sarah and Tom Pizzey explain some of the background to the work: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''The Field Guide to the Birds of Australia'' was first published in 1980, after more than fifteen years in the making. While it has continued to evolve through numerous reprints and revised editions, taking in new information, taxonomic changes, and changes in the way information has been presented, the voice throughout has remained resolutely that of its author, Graham Pizzey.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Following the death of Graham, our husband and father, in late 2001 it soon became clear that we were all keen to see the Guide continue. After all, the entire family was there at its inception and development: travelling to various corners of the continent as Graham took countless photographs and recorded observations in the field. An article in the ''[[Herald Sun|Herald]]'' in July 1967 shows the three Pizzey children sprawled on the living-room floor, poring over a map as we traced the journey we were about to make up through the Centre and down the west coast. The ‘Big Trip’ was to form the basis of the research for the first edition of the Guide, and was to give us an indelible appreciation of the natural world. And we’ve been involved in various ways ever since: looking at proofs, being asked for an opinion on an illustration or cover, or listening to an attempt to capture the call of a bird on paper. Responsible for providing his own children with an extraordinary childhood, this Guide is now being enjoyed by Graham’s small grandchildren. Its continuing relevance underpins our desire to see it remains in print, updated and augmented regularly."&lt;ref&gt;Pizzey &amp; Knight (2003), p.xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later editions==
* 1991 – The second, updated, edition was published by CollinsAngus&amp;RobertsonPublishers Pty Ltd.
* 1997 – The first major revision of the guide came with the publication of the third edition in 1997, and a change of title to '''''The Graham Pizzey &amp; Frank Knight Field Guide to the Birds of Australia'''''.  Published by [[Angus &amp; Robertson]] (an imprint of HarperCollins), it had all new plates by [[Frank Knight (artist)|Frank Knight]], each facing the completely revised text for the birds illustrated, while the length had expanded to 576 pages.  It was 235&amp;nbsp;mm in height by 155&amp;nbsp;mm in width, issued in a flexible plastic cover, and contained a foreword by [[Norman Wettenhall|Dr Norman Wettenhall]].  This and following editions were dedicated by the author to "…Rolf Baldwin and John Ponder, schoolmasters, who first taught me to appreciate birds, and words".&lt;ref&gt;Pizzey &amp; Knight (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2000 – fourth updated edition
* 2001 – fifth updated edition
* 2002 – sixth updated edition
* 2003 – The seventh revised and updated edition was published by HarperCollins''Publishers'' Pty Ltd.  Following Pizzey’s death the text was edited by Peter Menkhorst and the title modified slightly to '''''Graham Pizzey &amp; Frank Knight: The Field Guide to the Birds of Australia'''''.
* 2007 – The eighth updated and revised edition ({{ISBN|0207199353}}) included 46 newly recorded or recently described species.
* 2012 – The ninth updated edition ({{ISBN|9780732291938}}).

The '''Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden''' is an outdoor courtyard at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Designed by notable architect [[Philip Johnson]], the courtyard was conceived at the same time as Johnson's West Wing annex for the museum. Construction began in the spring on 1952 and was completed in April 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date= 1998|last=Reed |first=Peter | title=Philip Johnson and the Museum of Modern Art |location=New York |page=25 |isbn=9780870701177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Comstock Kirk''' (November 26, 1888 – March 23, 1979) was a United States diplomat.

==Early years==
[[File:Kirks Soap Yerkes Mars.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Kirk's soap]]
Alexander Comstock Kirk was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on November 26, 1888, the son of James Alexander Kirk (1840–1907)&lt;ref name=chs&gt;Chicago Historical Society, ''Charter, Constitution, By-laws, Membership List, Annual Report'' (1903), 286, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pMF6WO3P2lkC&amp;pg=PA286&amp; available online], accessed January 25, 2011. James Alexander Kirk was a Chicago Alderman in 1876-7 and influential in the creation of the city's paid Fire Department following the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; and Clara Comstock (1851–1936). His family lived in [[Hartland, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=life /&gt; Their wealth derived from one of America's largest soap manufacturing concerns,&lt;ref name=chs /&gt; which was founded by Kirk's grandfather in [[Utica, New York]], in 1839, relocated to Chicago in 1860, and capitalized as James S. Kirk &amp; Co. in 1900. James Alexander Kirk was a director of the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Securities'' (Chicago Directory Company, 1903), 234-5, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JRDZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp; available online], accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Its 2 national brands were "American Family" for laundry and "Juvenile" for the bath.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, 113-4, asked rhetorically in 1967: "who of my age could forget the 'Kirk's soap' of the advertisements of our boyhood?"&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk was "fat" and "unhappy" in childhood and enjoyed drawing. At age 9, he attended the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] until his family decided he was too young to be drawing nude models. He was then sent to work incognito in a soap factory until his identity was discovered. He was then tutored at home for half the year by Hughell Fosbroke, future head of the [[General Theological Seminary]] of New York, spending the other half traveling in Europe with his mother and sister.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;

Kirk attended the [[University of Chicago]] for one year and then [[Yale University]], where he excelled in physics&lt;ref name=life /&gt; and graduated in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kmc9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA236&amp; ''Catalogue of the Officers and Graduates of Yale University in New Haven, 1701-1910'' (New Haven: Tuttle, Morehouse &amp; Taylor, 1910), 236], accessed January 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared with the Yale University Dramatic Association in 1908-09.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brinsley Sheridan, ''The Critic or A Tragedy Rehearsed'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Dramatic Association, 1908), xix-xx; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1909/01/05/archives/yale-men-score-in-old-comedies-they-win-great-applause-in-their.html "Yale Men Score in Old Comedies," January 5, 1909], accessed January 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk's father died of a heart attack in 1907.&lt;ref name=chs /&gt;

He next spent 2 years at the [[Sciences Po|School of Political Sciences]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=life /&gt; In order to fulfill his mother's promise to his late father, he earned his law degree from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University: [https://books.google.com/books?id=PFojAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA785&amp; ''Quinquennial Catalogue of the Officers and Graduates, 1636-1915'' (Harvard University Press, 1915), 785], accessed January 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to the Illinois bar. He joined the board of the family business at a salary of $10,000 a year.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;

Kirk had two sisters, Gertrude 24 years his senior and Margaret his near contemporary. His sister Margaret married Albert Billings Ruddock in New York's [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine]] in March 1912. The couple left for Berlin following the ceremony. Ruddock was Third Secretary of the American Embassy in Berlin in 1913, when Mrs. Kirk visited the couple there.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1912/03/17/archives/article-24-no-title.html "City Social Notes," March 17, 1912], accessed January 25, 2011; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1913/08/03/archives/germany-holds-american-crowds-no-diminution-in-the-throngs-of.html "American Tourists Still Crowd Berlin," July 27, 1913], accessed January 25, 2011, where the relationship is mistaken called daughter-in-law rather than daughter; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1913/08/03/archives/germany-holds-american-crowds-no-diminution-in-the-throngs-of.html "Germany Holds American Crowds," August 3, 1913], accessed January 25, 2011. On Ruddock see also Frederic William Wile, ''The Assault: Germany before the Outbreak and England in War-time; A Personal Narrative'' (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1916), 107, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4xE2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp; available online], accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 Ruddock became Chairman of the Board of Trustees of [[California Institute of Technology]], where an [[House System at the California Institute of Technology#Ruddock House|undergraduate residence hall]] was named for him in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;''The California Tech'': [http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/347/1/1954_11_04_56_06.pdf "Tech trustees pick Ruddock," November 4, 1954], accessed January 28, 2011. Ruddock;s State Department service lasted until 1923. He joined the Board of Trustees in 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic career==
Kirk joined the [[United States Foreign Service|American Diplomatic Service]] on March 6, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Service List'', 1939, 65. The Diplomatic Service later became the Foreign Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, he was transferred from his post as Secretary of the Embassy in Berlin to a position in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1916/03/02/archives/berlin-post-for-harriman-new-yorker-will-succeed-kirk-as-secretary.html Berlin Post for Harriman," March 2, 1916], accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk served as private secretary to the Secretary of State during [[World War I]] and accompanied him in that position to the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. He then lived in "a commodious old house in Georgetown with his mother to act as hostess on the occasion of his entertainments," until posted to [[Beijing|Peking]] as Secretary of the Embassy.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1920/04/01/archives/social-notes-new-york.html "Social Notes," April 1, 1920], accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

He managed the State Department budget for a time in the 1920s, and later said he thought it "an obligation" to spend the entire amount in order to support the argument for additional appropriations.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;

Kirk was Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Rome in 1932. His mother was presented to [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Elena of Italy]] on March 9, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1932/03/10/archives/queen-sees-ten-americans-italian-sovereign-inquires-about-the.html "Queen Sees Ten Americans," March 10, 1932], accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She lived in Rome during his service there, and Kirk entertained important guests at her home, the Villa Spada on the [[Janiculum]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rushton Fairclough, ''Warming Both Hands: The Autobiography of Henry Rushton Fairclough'' (Stanford University Press, 1941), 506. Kirk was First Secretary at the time of Fairclough's visit.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in 1930, long before rising to ambassadorial rank, he entertained lavishly. He hosted an opera party for [[Millicent Hearst|Mrs. William Randolph Hearst]] on her 1930 tour of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,738825,00.html Italy: Publisher's Wife Abroad," March 17, 1930], accessed January 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk was assigned to Moscow as Embassy Counselor and consul general effective March 18, 1938,&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1938/03/29/archives/alexander-kirk-named-counselor-at-moscow.html Alexander Kirk Named Counselor at Moscow," March 29, 1938], accessed January 23, 2011; ''Foreign Service List'', 1939, 28&lt;/ref&gt; where he was the senior official in the 9-month interim between the service of Ambassadors [[Joseph E. Davies|Davies]] and [[Laurence Steinhardt|Steinhardt]].&lt;ref name=life /&gt;&lt;ref name=baer313&gt;George W. Baer, ''A Question of Trust, The Origins of U.S.-Soviet Diplomatic Relations: The Memoirs of Loy. W, Henderson'' (Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986), 313. "In my opinion," wrote [[Loy W. Henderson]], "the embassy never functioned better than it did during the nine months that he was in charge of it."&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as [[Chargé d'affaires]] in Berlin beginning in May 1939 and became the senior officer when the American ambassador, [[Hugh R. Wilson]], was recalled to protest the anti-Jewish attacks of [[Kristallnacht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kirk, Home, Silent on Rome Mission|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/19/94006160.pdf |accessdate=May 8, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 19, 1940}} The appointment was effective April 13, 1939, ''Foreign Service List'', 1940, 75; Baer, 313&lt;/ref&gt; Though his status was too low to allow access to important officials in the German government, he communicated with them by staging conversations close to a device the Germans used to eavesdrop on his conversations.&lt;ref name=life /&gt; ''Time'' called him "adroit" in his "uncomfortable post."&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764130,00.html Foreign Relations: Leg-Men," July 1, 1940], accessed January 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He developed contacts with Germans who opposed the Nazi regime and became convinced, in spite of Germany's early victories, that the war would end badly for Germany. Discussing with noted dissident [[Helmuth James Graf von Moltke|Helmuth James von Moltke]] the need for Germany to suffer complete defeat with no one to blame but its Nazi leaders, he said: "Do you want to know my solution? It's a flood without an ark."&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth James von Moltke, ''Letters to Freya'' (NY: Alfred A. Knopf, 1990), 14-5, 70, 82, 111, 115n. Moltke was a civilian legal aide to the German general staff.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, in 1943, Moltke twice tried without success to contact Kirk, whom he trusted as an intermediary between the German opposition and the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Motlke, 317n, 372n&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk served briefly as Embassy Counselor in Rome before becoming Minister to Egypt in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1943/10/06/archives/nelson-and-landis-reach-cairo-by-air-wpb-chief-continues-journey.html "Nelson and Landis Reach Cairo by Air," October 6, 1943], accessed January 23, 2011; ''Foreign Service List'', 1942, 10&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine described him as "smooth, spare."&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,850980-2,00.html Foreign Relations: Winant to London," February 17, 1941], accessed January 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 29, 1941, to March 29, 1944, Kirk served as [[United States Ambassador to Egypt|Ambassador to Egypt]], first as head of the U.S. Legation and then of the Embassy. He advised the State Department in 1941 that a Jewish state "is incapable of realization in the future unless imposed by force on an unwilling native population." Under Secretary of State [[Sumner Welles]] did not share his assessment and did not forward Kirk's views to the White House.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Davidson, "Review: Sympathy for Jewish Statehood," in ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 15, no. 1, Autumn 1985, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on his experience with [[Nazi propaganda]] and antisemitism in Germany, Kirk expanded the embassy's coverage of Arabic-language broadcasts, providing complete translations of what came to be known as the "Axis Broadcasts in Arabic" along with his weekly analysis from 1941 to 1944, which Hull circulated widely. He dissected the Nazi's manipulation of anti-colonial, anti-Jewish, and anti-Bolshevik sentiment and their charges that Roosevelt and Churchill were being manipulated by their Jewish supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Herf, ''Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), 10–1, 72–3, 86, 97–9, 101–2, 106, 217&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of his Cairo tenure, Kirk focused on the strategic necessity of Allied victory in the Middle East because it would be impossible to counter the Nazi's exploitation of an Axis victory in its propaganda. Once the Allies won control of the region, he stressed political analysis and repeatedly underscored the critical role of the Egyptian capital in Arab nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Herf, ''Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World'', 70–1, 127, 140–1&lt;/ref&gt; As Kirk looked to the end of the war, he anticipated a post-colonial world in which nations operated freely in a free enterprise environment, unlike Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] who expected the persistence of traditional spheres of influence, notably that of Great Britain in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy E. Gallagher, "Anglo-American Rivalry and the Establishment of a Medical Research Institute in Egypt, 1942-1948," in ''International History Review'', vol. 9, no. 2, May 1987, 292; Barry Rubin, "Anglo-American Relations in Saudi Arabia, 1941-45," in ''Journal of Contemporary History'', vol. 14, no. 2, April 1979, 255&lt;/ref&gt; While posted to Cairo, Kirk kept one house in the city for lunch, another near the pyramids for dinner and sleeping, and a houseboat on the Nile. He hosted [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]], [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] at the second house for the November 1943 [[Cairo Conference]].&lt;ref name=life /&gt; He has been described as "an archeological dilettante" who liked to lecture his guests as they gazed at the pyramids. [[Clare Boothe Luce]] claimed to have flummoxed him by pre-empting his performance by asking: "Mr. Ambassador, what ''are'' those strange-looking objects?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Shadegg]], ''Claire Boothe Luce'' (NY: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1970), 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with several military men Kirk devised the successful plan to attack Rommel's communications instead of his ground forces.&lt;ref name=life /&gt; He later received the United States of America Typhus Commission Medal for his support of the Commission's work during his time in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;"Ambassadors Helped in Fight to Check Typhus," in ''The Science News-Letter'', vol. 47, no. 6, February 10, 1945, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

While resident in Cairo, Kirk was also accredited to the government-in-exile of Greece until November 13, 1941, and to Saudi Arabia until July 18, 1943.

Kirk was appointed U.S. representative on the Allied Advisory Council for Italy, with the rank of ambassador, on April 4, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronology," in ''Bulletin of International News'', vol. 21, no. 8, April 15, 1944, 328; the appointment was effective March 30, 1944, ''Foreign Service List'', 1945, 53&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Ambassador to Italy on November 30, 1944,&lt;ref&gt;"Chronology", in ''Bulletin of International News'', vol. 21, no. 25, December 9, 1944, 1081-2; the effective date of the appointment was December 8, 1944, ''Foreign Service List'', 1945, 27&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 1945 became the first ambassador of any country to present his credentials to the new Italian government.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1945/01/09/archives/kirk-offers-credentials-us-envoy-is-first-to-do-so-in-rome-visit-to.html "Kirk Offers Credentials," January 9, 1945], accessed January 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his appointment, ''Time'' gave him the title "suave Career Man."&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,778236,00.html "U.S. at War: Work Done," December 18, 1944], accessed January 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned in 1946. When the American [[Office of War Information]] produced an Italian-language publication, Kirk insisted it be labeled propaganda to maintain a clear distinction between what Italians were accomplishing for themselves or not.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;

In August 1945, he received petitions from Russian prisoners of war, taken by the Germans and liberated by Allied forces. They wrote to him in his role as Political Advisor to [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) and claimed the status of "political refugees" and asked "in the name of humanity" not to be repatriated to the Soviet Union. Kirk wrote to Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes|Byrnes]] seeking guidance, a diplomatic way of expressing his reservations about the repatriation policy. He was instructed to make certain none of the prisoners was actually from [[Poland]] or the [[Baltic States]] and to proceed with the repatriations.&lt;ref&gt;Cathal J. Nolan, "Americans in the Gulag: Detention of US Citizens by Russia and the Onset of the Cold War, 1944-49," in ''Journal of Contemporary History'', vol. 25, no. 4, October 1990, 532-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk was long famous for entertaining and continued even when forced to operate in Rome "under a wartime minimum." Six or eight guests joined him for lunch or dinner, often many more. One Friday lunch he hosted about 20 enlisted men. Though some involved in recruiting the guests worried that a Negro corporal might not be well received, Kirk gave him the place of honor on his right.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;

[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] described him near the end of his career: "To call Kirk an ornament of the State Department is almost a libelous understatement....Kirk's true value resides in the fact that he is an American who, far from being an innocent abroad, knows Europe infinitely better than most Europeans. This makes him almost unique in the current roster of U.S. foreign representatives in the diplomatic, charitable, or didactic spheres. Kirk's career should be studied in detail, like ''The Education of Henry Adams''."&lt;ref name=life /&gt; ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' in July 1946 called him "foppish, intelligent, and very rich."&lt;ref&gt;John Lamberton Harper, ''America and the Reconstruction of Italy, 1945-1948'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 17, 171n33, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dnyXtXWR0wwC&amp;pg=PA17&amp; available online], accessed August 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk predicted in 1945 that future diplomats should be technical experts "chosen for the ability not only to diagnose economic, industrial and political trends, but also to adjust their dislocations before they can start wars." He lamented the willingness of governments to spend on wars far more than on the diplomacy that might prevent them.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;

A few years after Kirk's retirement, as Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] launched a [[Lavender scare|campaign against suspected homosexuals in government]], one investigator's 1948 report charged that State Department employees [[Carmel Offie]] and [[Charles W. Thayer]] "were very close personal friends of former Ambassador Alexander Kirk who is not now in the service but who had a very bad reputation of being a homosexual and certainly protected a lot of homosexual people."&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Dean, ''Imperial Brotherhood: Gender and the Making of Cold War Foreign Policy'' (Amherst, MA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2001), 106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In the 1920s, when he was Counselor to the American Embassy in Rome, Kirk remodeled a significant building in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], the Robinson house, at the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and R Street and "filled it with furniture, rugs, hangings and objects of art brought from the Orient."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1927/12/25/archives/georgetown-holds-oldtime-prestige-its-spirit-triumphs-over-its.html Richard V. Oulahan, "Georgetown Holds Old-Time Prestige," December 25, 1927], accessed January 24, 2011; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1929/05/19/archives/georgetown-house-of-history-bought-francis-c-de-wolf-will-restore.html Richard V. Oulahan, "Georgetown House of History Bought," May 19, 1929], accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 he sold this estate, including its "elaborate formal gardens, outsize ballroom, marble-floored billiard room, and swimming pool," to [[Evalyn Walsh McLean]], mining heiress and owner of the [[Hope Diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,932308,00.html "People, Jan. 26, 1942"], accessed January 23, 2011. For a brief history of the property, see Grace Dunlop Peter, ''A Portrait of Old George Town'' (Richmond, Dietz Press, 1951), 298-9, [http://www.accessgenealogy.com/book/index.cgi?folder=georgetown-portrait&amp;next=16 available online]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While posted to Berlin, he lived in an "enormous mansion" in the "swank" [[Grunewald]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=kennan113&gt;George F. Kennan, ''Memoirs, 1925-1950'' (Boston: Little, Brown, 1967), 113&lt;/ref&gt; One German who visited described it as "one vast hall after another, and he quiet alone in the midst of it. Very funny; a little like the theatre." His staff of servants spoke only Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Moltke, 29n&lt;/ref&gt; He held "a large buffet luncheon every Sunday noon, as a means of revenging himself for such hospitality as his position required him to accept."&lt;ref name=kennan113 /&gt;
[[File:Bernini PalazzoBarberini.jpg|thumb|right|Façade of Palazzo Barberini]]
While Ambassador in Rome, Kirk lived in the [[Palazzo Barberini|Barberini palace]], which he redecorated. He filled a large enclosure the size of a tennis court with "Renaissance tables and settees covered in ivory silk," according to [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine, to create what he termed "a sort of cozy sitting room."&lt;ref name=life&gt;''Life'': [https://books.google.com/books?id=1UkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp; Noel F. Busch, "Alexander Kirk," August 13, 1945], accessed January 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Life'' profiled him in 1945, it reported that he had always established fine residences wherever he was posted: "The Ambassador is fond of houses, and especially big ones. Equipped with ample private funds and the courage of his complexes, Kirk sees no reason why he should not capitalize the chance his profession gives him to indulge this fondness, all the more since such indulgence usually works out to the benefit of the State Department in one way or another."&lt;ref name=life /&gt; His nickname around this time was "Buffy."&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Newman, ''The Cold War Romance of Lillian Hellman and John Melby'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1989), 77&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 he attributed "his excellent health to the fact that he has never worn himself down by any form of exercise more violent than scratching, which he only does when suffering from insomnia at 6 a.m."&lt;ref name=life /&gt;

He planned to retire to Arizona and bought a piece of land in the [[White Mountains (Arizona)|White Mountains]] at the end of World War II. He joked that he would live there not in a house but in a cave.&lt;ref name=life /&gt; Another diplomat reported that he retired to the mountains of Colorado and "amused himself operating a ranch and raising cattle" for a few years before relocating to Texas.&lt;ref name=baer313 /&gt;

His sister Gertrude Kirk Metzeroff died in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1948 at the age of 84. According to her obituary, her brother Alexander was then living in Washington, D.C., and Santa Barbara, California, while her sister Margaret was living in Santa Barbara.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Petersburg Times'': [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QzAoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CE8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1328,6230916&amp; "Mrs. Metzeroff, Here 12 Years, Dies at Age 84," August 5, 1948], accessed January 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk died in [[Tucson, Arizona]], on March 23, 1979. He is buried with his mother in Rome's [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome|Protestant Cemetery]] (Cimitero Acattolico).&lt;ref&gt;Academia di Danimarca: [http://www.acdan.it/protcem/work/pcEN.html#Stone1450 Stone 1450], accessed March 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1967 memoirs, [[George F. Kennan]] sketched an affectionate portrait of Kirk, as he knew him in Berlin before America entered World War II: "a confirmed bachelor, profoundly saddened by the recent death of an adored mother who, while she was alive, had preempted much of both his companionship and his emotional life, Kirk drowned the inner emptiness in the performance of his arduous official duties," sleeping in an office alcove while working 16 to 18 hours daily.&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, 112&lt;/ref&gt; He continued:&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, 113-5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|He was a carryover from an older day when to be rich entitled you to be eccentric, and he made the most of the privilege....

Deliberately, I think, as a gesture of defiance and self-protection, and in the indulgence of a fine sense of the theatrical, Kirk worked at giving himself the aspect of exactly that sort of American career diplomat of which the American philistine has always been the most suspicious: elegant, overrefined, haughty, and remote. It was a manner of enlivening life by playing the buffoon....His understanding was intuitive rather than analytical. His conversation consisted largely of weary, allusive quips. His posing sometimes went so far as to raise doubts whether he was serious.

But behind this facade of urbane and even exaggerated sophistication there lay a great intuitive shrewdness and a devastating critical sense of humor, directed to himself as well as others. No one impressed him....He despised the Nazis and held them at arm's length with barbed irony....

The only thing worth living for, he once told me, was good form. He himself had little to live for; there were moments when he would have liked to leave this life; but suicide would be an abrupt act, and abruptness was the height of bad form....He disclaimed all further interest in the Foreign Service, since his mother's death. He had entered it, he solemnly maintained, only to spare her having her bags inspected at frontiers. But he could not just resign, especially in wartime; that would have been abrupt....

After service as Ambassador in Egypt and Italy, he sidled, quietly and unobserved, out of all of our lives.}}

Kirk claimed he escaped from diplomatic functions by whatever ruse the situation required. At one embassy in Rome he found it necessary to leave by a door he could only reach by going under a grand piano. "In a case of this sort, Kirk recommends slow motion, which, he says, often prevents witnesses from even noticing a maneuver which, if executed fast, might horrify them."&lt;ref name=life /&gt;

He insisted his favorite color was gray. He never had fresh flowers, rather he collected artificial ones in his favorite color. His wardrobe and household were maintained by a servant named Mario, who joined the Kirk household in Mexico early in Kirk's career and continued through his stint as ambassador in Rome.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">The  '''''Annales Cavenses''''' are a chronicle compiled at the [[La Trinità della Cava]] [[abbey]] in [[Cava de' Tirreni]],   [[province of Salerno]], southern [[Italy]]. 
It consists of annalistic entries spanning the years 568 to 1318, i.e. essentially the entire duration of the [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages in Italy]] (but only for the last two centuries or so compiled contemporaneously with the events recorded).

Some of the entries are of scientific interest as historical records of events such as [[earthquakes]] or [[astronomical |astronomical phenomena]].  The text was first edited in 1839 by [[Georg Heinrich Pertz]] in his ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''.

Not to be confused is the so-called ''[[Chronicon Cavense]]'' (also known as  ''Annalista Salernitanus''), a work which was once considered authentic but in 1847 was established as an 18th-century forgery due to  [[Francesco Maria Pratilli]] (Georg Heinrich Pertz, Rudolf Köpke, ''Über das Chronicon Cavense und andere von Pratillo herausgegebene Quellenschriften'', in "Archiv der Gesellschaft für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde", IX (1847),  1-239).

The '''Blue Shirts Society''', also known as the '''Society of Practice of the Three Principles of the People''' ({{zh|三民主義力行社}}, commonly abbreviated as SPTPP), the '''Spirit Encouragement Society''' (勵志社, SES) and the '''China Reconstruction Society''' (中華復興社, CRS), was a secret [[fascist]] clique in the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, or the Chinese Nationalist Party).

Although in its early stage the society's most important members came from the [[Whampoa Military Academy]], and constituted elements of the KMT's [[Whampoa Clique]], by the 1930s its influence extended into the military and political spheres, and had influence upon [[Economic history of China (1912-49)|China's economy]] and [[Chinese society|society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dc7NOiTSgM0C&amp;pg=PA165 |title=War and nationalism in China, 1925-1945|author=Hans J.

==Birth==
The Blue Shirts origins can be traced to the Whampoa Clique of 1924 - professional military officers - many of whom had sworn personal loyalty to [[Chiang Kai-shek]], as well to the ideals of [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s [[Three Principles of the People]].

After the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] of 1927, Chiang and the KMT seized most of China's territories. The government established was in a degree of social crisis: there were tensions as Japan's conquest of [[Manchuria]]; Chiang had also formally split the [[First United Front]], the alliance between the KMT and the CCP ([[Communist Party of China]]), turning the two parties against each other. The CCP had bases in the cities and to a lesser degree in the countryside, posing a threat to Chiang's government. The KMT itself was not of one mind; divided into several cliques, there were power struggles between Chiang, [[Hu Hanmin]] and [[Wang Jingwei]]. China was still scourged by [[corruption]], [[poverty]], and infrequent [[civil war]].

Being the foundation of Chiang's rule, some Whampoa graduates felt it time to take action. Consequently, in July 1931, {{ill|Teng Jie|zh|滕傑}} (滕傑) and Xiao Zanyu (蕭贊育) were sent back to China to investigate the threat from Japan and any forthcoming war.

When Teng and Xiao returned to China, they were upset to find the KMT, in their eyes, "gravitating toward decadence". Teng designed a blueprint to reform the KMT, suggesting a single great and powerful leader could save China and the KMT. The leader could rule by all means, hopefully as a [[benevolent dictator]]. Chiang was a sound candidate, and over the following months Teng traveled around the capital of [[Nanjing]] seeking support from Whampoa fellows.

Teng was acquainted with Zeng Kuoqing (曾擴情), among the first graduates of Whampoa, and the man in charge of the Whampoa Alumni Association. Because the KMT banned organized political parties, Teng and Zeng searched for alumni in secret. Zeng used his influence and personal relations among Whampoa graduates to organize periodic meetings to discuss Teng's plan.

After several months the group included prominent Whampoa graduates, including He Zhonghan (賀衷寒), widely regarded as one of The Three Most Outstanding Whampoa graduates (the other two being CCP members Jiang Xianyun (蔣先雲) and Chen Geng (陳賡), the patriarch of the Sun Yat-sen Theory Research Group at that time); Hu Zongnan (胡宗南)，a rising young general in Chiang's National Revolutionary Army; Deng Wenyi (鄧文儀 )，another patriarch of the Sun Yat-sen Theory Research Group and a secretary to Chiang, and; Feng Ti (丰悌), the Commissar of the 1st Division of the KMT army.

In September 1931, in the third meeting of the group, an organization to reform the KMT and fight against Japan was decided. Under the direction of He Zhonghan, this group was named the Society of the Practice of [[Three Principles of People]] (三民主義力行社, SPTPP). Teng was elected [[General Secretary]]. The party also issued guidance on the establishment, discipline and organization of members, and confirmed its main mission as follows:
:1. use secret measures to fight against the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]], the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]], other KMT cliques, and ensure the Whampoa clique's domination of the KMT and China;
:2. use the public image of the Whampoa Alumni Association to enroll new members and set up a formal, well-organized and highly disciplined group.

Funds were mainly raised by Deng, who ran the KMT's Party Book Shop, a publishing house for party-political propaganda. Furthermore, to avoid arrest under the KMT's political organization ban, members decided not to tell Chiang Kai-shek of their plan, even while regarding him as their spiritual mentor and leader.

Before long Kang Ze (康澤), who published the ''China Daily'' newspaper with the permission of Chiang, became the mouthpiece of the SPTPP.

In December 1931, under pressure both inside and outside the KMT, Chiang resigned. While in retirement at his hometown in [[Zhejiang]], Chiang showed growing interest in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|fascism]]. Deng subsequently let Chiang know of the existence of the SPTPP. Chiang summoned He, Teng and Kang to a meeting, where he announced his idea for a more formal and disciplined organization like those in Italy and Germany. Thus specific rules and articles to guide the party were drafted.

With support from Chiang, Teng designed a hierarchical organization style. At the top was Chiang, with the foundations made from the elite of Whampoa graduates. New members could only be accepted with two recommendations and approval from Chiang himself. Members were not allowed to resign unless the group faced dissolution. If there was any violation of discipline, members would receive severe punishment.

In 1932 Chiang regained the presidency after a power struggle between his opponents. Hoping to speed reform of the SPTPP, in a secret meeting in February [[Gui Yongqing]] (桂永清)， a member of the SPTPP, recommended Liu Jianqun (劉健羣) as a suitable candidate. Liu, He Yingqin's (何應欽) secretary, contributed much to the group.

Liu wrote a pamphlet called ''Some Opinions On The Reform of the KMT''. In this, Liu proposed reform of the KMT be enforced via a group of elites established and organized along the lines of  Mussolini's [[Blackshirts|MVSN]] or Blackshirts. Members would wear blue shirts to pledge their allegiance. Accordingly, the leader should encourage by his sublime, superior spirit. Under the direction of the leader, all members would live simple and disciplined lives, and all cadres would be treated equally, with incomes and lives under strict supervision. Violation would be severely punished. In return, the people would entrust property and their families to the country and the supreme leader. Public responsibilities would depend on ability, from military service to absolute obedience of orders including surveillance of one's neighborhoods. Lives would be divided into stages, including a youth wing. Thus, China would be turned into a militarized society, with a three tier organization, highest to lowest: Supreme Leader - Blue Shirt Society - People.

Liu Jianqun ordered membership be kept a secret:

"With a view to attaining the object of immediately overthrowing the feudal influences, exterminating the Red Bandits, and dealing with foreign insult[s], members of the Blue Shirts Society should conduct in secret their activities in various provinces, xian, and cities, except for the central Guomindang headquarters and other political organs whose work must be executed in an official manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYYYQYK6FAYC&amp;pg=PA75 |title=Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese secret service|author=[[Frederic E. Wakeman]] |year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=|page=75|isbn=0-520-23407-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang met with Liu and appreciated his theory, leading to the evolution of the SPTPP into the Blue Shirt Society (BSS). In March 1932, under cover of an existing club called the Spirit Encouragement Society (勵志社)，the SPTPP officially announced its establishment. Although Liu's proposal that members wear blue shirts and name their society after the blue shirts was not accepted, the SPTPP was privately known as the BSS from then on. In its formal opening ceremony, Teng was elected General Secretary, with He, Kang as Standing Secretariat. The BSS consisted of six divisions: Secretariat, Organization, Propaganda, Military, Special Agency and Logistics. The secret society reached its peak, with the BSS infiltrating the country's political system, military and even the everyday lives of people.

==Rise and achievements==
During the early to mid-1930s Chiang was busy carrying out his suppression of the CCP's Red Army in the countryside. With his permission, the BSS took over the defense of [[Nanking]]. Most of the prominent Whampoa graduates now got promotions as commanders and became BSS members. Besides increasing its influence in the army, the BSS infiltrated the police and security services in major cities, and recruited members in the KMT youth league. The BSS now had influence in China's military, labor unions, publishing houses and schools. A new structure of power had emerged, with the BSS at the core of the Whampoa Clique, coexisting and competing against the two better known cliques: the [[CC Clique]], led by [[Chen Lifu]] (陳立夫) and [[Chen Guofu]] (陳果夫)，whose remit was dealing with party issues, and; the [[Politics Research Group]] (政學系) led by [[Yang Yongtai]] (楊永泰) and [[Zhang Qun]] (張群), whose remit was the day-to-day running of the KMT government.

Liu's pamphlet was accepted as the guideline of the BSS, and part of it was revised into the Regulation of Life Discipline. In accordance with this, BSS members would be paid low wages, with part being donated to the BSS. Gambling and opium were banned. Anti-corruption laws and laws prohibiting BSS members from having mistresses were to be strictly abided by. The practice of BSS members became quite distinct from the majority of KMT bureaucrats.

In June 1932, an anti-graft campaign was launched under the direction of BSS member, Deng Wenyi. A special force, mostly comprising BSS members, cracked down on corrupt police officers in [[Wuhan]]. After several arrests and executions, the police force was considered improved. Deng then waged war against organized crimes, prostitution, opium and gambling. After 3 months, Deng had won Chiang's praise. Chiang wanted this effort to be promoted around the country, and so launched a campaign to purify the capital. The results were less successful and derided as a failure.

Meanwhile, the BSS was playing an active role in suppressing the CCP. Zeng Kuoqing, using his status in the Whampoa Alumni Association, wrote a letter to Xu Jishen (許繼慎), commander of [[Zhang Guotao]]'s 4th Red Army and a Whampoa graduate, asking Xu to defect to the KMT. Xu did not reply, but when his superiors discovered the letter, suspicions were raised and the CCP decided to carry out a purge. Thousands of commanders and soldiers were tortured and executed, weakening the CCP's resistance. In light of this, in October 1932, Hu Zongnan led his army (mainly commanded by BSS officers) in a cruel and decisive battle against [[Xu Xiangqian]] in Hekou [[Anhui]]. In contrast to other KMT armies, the army had high-morale, was composed of hand-picked men, and equipped with the best weaponry. With strong support from other armies also led by BSS members such as Yu Jishi (俞濟時) and Huang Jie (黃杰), Xu's CCP army was routed. After suffering some 10,000 casualties, Zhang and Xu retreated. Hu and his troop chased, and when Zhang and his army reached [[Sichuan]] to set up another base, Hu remained in [[Gansu]] nearby. Hu, with his chosen men and strong army, became known as the King of Northwestern China.

Coinciding With the BSS's ever-increasing power and influence, disagreements within the BSS leadership mounted. Chiang, who regarded the BSS as a tool, would not allow them more power and influence. Teng could not accept this and conflicts between him and Chiang were frequent. In 1933, Chiang chose He Zhonghan to succeed Teng as General Secretary of the BSS.

As a more ambitious and skilled politician than Teng, He Zhonghan won a power struggle against his BSS rival Liu Jianqun. Subsequently, He decided to set up a propaganda network run by Kang Ze. This special agency under the direction of Dai Li, and his deputy Zheng Jiemin (鄭介民), evolved into a network infiltrating every corner of China. The BSS's influence grew into [[North China|Northern China]], which was under direct threat of invasion by Japan. In 1933 the Japanese army invaded Rehe, and KMT armies fought against them along the [[Great Wall]]. The BSS now changed from an elite secret society into an anti-Japanese mass movement. Liu was sent to the BSS's Northern China Division, which was called the China Reconstruction Society (中華復興社，CRS). Most members were university lecturers and student groups, and in the summer of that year the CRS had divisions in 24 provinces of China with more than 40,000 members. With the CRS controlling the political training system of the KMT, new recruits were always available. With thousands of members, political instructors and front organizations, the BSS had a kingdom under the direction of He.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Establishment of the CRS.jpg|right|frame|Ceremony of Establishment of the CRS, the first line from right to left: Deng, Du Xingru, Zeng, He and Gui]] --&gt;
Besides setting up the CRS, the BSS also played a part in the Second Stage Revolution. Using influence in Northern and Southwestern China to persuade local warlords to pledge allegiance to Chiang, a reform of the KMT armies was carried out. An air force and armored corps was set up, alongside wars against corruption, opium and poverty. Reconstruction of rural areas was undertaken, with roads built and bank loans provided to peasants. The most significant part of this movement was Kang Ze's New [[Jiangxi]] Style and Special Detachment (別動隊，NJSSD).

In 1933 during the [[5th Suppression Campaign]] against the CCP, Chiang decided to set up a paramilitary force. Kang was appointed to lead the NJSSD, the only direct military group in the BSS.  Soon the NJSSD had integrated of military, political, police, military police and secret police powers. At its peak it had 24,000 members and three divisions of regular troops. The NJSSD had peasants living near Soviet Jiangxi and Northern Anhui categorized and confined, where they had limited access to the outside world. A family hoping to prove itself non-CCP needed to have the guarantee of four other families, and promise not to collaborate with or provide support to the CCP. Violations would have the whole family executed, along with the families of the four guarantors. The NJSSD set up hundreds of concentration camps around Shangrao, Jiangxi, where they tortured and executed residents and CCP captives. Under this system, fewer and fewer peasants supported the CCP. Merchants who smuggled materiel to the CCP were also broken down, with peasants organized to build blockades against the Soviet Territory. With the shortage of supplies, accompanied by heavy attacks from the KMT, the CCP had to launch its now-famous [[Long March]] in order to retreat.

The NJSSD started the New Jiangxi Style plan in territories previously occupied by the Communists, providing compulsory education and free medical treatment to peasants. With a brutal but effective anti-corruption campaign, they provided loans, seeds and pesticides also. Nevertheless, the NJSSD engaged in fervent brutality, executions of perceived CCP sympathisers, and innocents. In one case, in Mount Dabie, previously the base of the 4th Red Army in Northern Anhui, more than half a million were massacred. At the same time, in accordance with NJSSD and New Jiangxi Style, Kang reached the peak of his career, and he raised enough finances to challenge He as leader of the BSS.

Xiao Zuolin (肖作霖), a BSS member early on, drafted a plan called the Whole New Culture Movement and proposed the establishment of an organization called the Chinese Culture Academy to increase the BSS's influence in culture. Xiao got Deng Wenyi's support and carried out his plan by taking over several newspapers and journals, and by enrolling its members in universities. Its scheme of forging a movement for a new culture was adopted by Chiang, and on 19 February 1934, he announced the [[New Life Movement]] at a meeting in [[Nanchang]]. The plan involved reconstructing the moral system of the Chinese and welcoming a renaissance and reconstruction of Chinese national pride.

In March, Chiang issued guidance, consisting of 95 rules of the New Life Movement, being a mixture of Chinese traditions and western standards. It was a vast propaganda movement, with war mobilization and military maneuvers on a scale that China had never experienced before. But because the plan was so ambitious and rigid, and because its policies created too much inconvenience in the everyday lives of the people, it fell into disfavor. Nearly three years later in 1936, Chiang had to accept that his favorite movement had failed. Deng, Kang and Jiang Xiaoxian (蔣孝先), Chiang's nephew and bodyguard, also BSS members were appointed General Secretariats of the New Life Movement, with supervision of public lifestyles enforced by BSS cadres. By controlling the mouthpieces of the KMT, the BSS openly expressed advocacy of fascism in its publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmIJNq5dUp8C&amp;pg=PA77 |title=A place in the sun: Marxism and Fascism in China's long revolution|author=Anthony James Gregor|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|location=|page=77|isbn=0-8133-3782-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall==
Unlike Teng, He was a professional politician, and never concealed his ambition for power. After fostering a Hunan Clique in the BSS, Chiang became concerned the BSS might threaten his governance. In 1934 he accused the BSS of corruption and malfunction, dismissing He as General Secretary. Liu Jianqun was appointed as successor. With NJSSD and the Southwestern Clique behind him, and the Zhejiang Clique led by Hu Zongnan and Dai Li opposing him, Liu Jianqun's BSS faced the same fragmented fate as the KMT it had helped get rid of.

With the New Culture Movement failed but still officially ongoing, the BSS spread its influence into the cultural centers of [[Shanghai]] and other major cities that used to be the [[CC Clique]]'s power base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmemAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |title=Government and politics in Kuomintang China, 1927-1937|author=Hung-mao Tien|year=1972|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=|page=63|isbn=0-8133-3782-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1934, the Nanchang Airport, built by donations from international Chinese, and designed to train the KMT air force, was burned down. The Aviation Commissioner, Xu Peigen (徐培根), who was also a BSS member, was the primary suspect. Deng was sent to investigate this case. He reached the conclusion that the fire was accidentally caused by a cigarette dropped by a soldier, but Chen Lifu and Yang Yongtai argued Xu masterminded the fire to eliminate evidence of corruption, and Deng had colluded to cover it up. Xu was kept in custody, Deng was sacked, and his titles were removed. The Chinese Culture Academy was banned. Dai Li was sent to take over Deng's investigation agency and quietly integrated it into his own special agency, which later evolved into the Military Statistical Bureau, the notorious secret police of the KMT. Dai no longer played any major part in the BSS now he had set up his own kingdom.

Taking advantage of this blow to the BSS's prestige, the Politics Research Clique consummated the Administrative Office System, adding new levels of administration between provinces and counties (the two tier system of provinces and counties had been used in China for more than a thousand years). With the appearance of new offices, the Politics Research Clique was able to control the county level. Many bureaucrats who used to be loyal to the CC Clique and the BSS defected to the suddenly more powerful Politics Research Clique. The Politics Research Clique took over the security forces, the police and the militia step by step. Liu, whose failures in the BSS were an embarrassment, was replaced by Feng Ti under the excuse that he had health problems. He was sent to Manchuria to work with Zeng Kuoqing.

In 1935, two editors of a pro-Japanese newspapers were assassinated in Manchuria. The Japanese thought these actions were taken by the BSS and argued it was a violation of the [[Tanggu Truce|Tanggu Accord]] signed to keep the status quo between the Japanese and China. [[Yoshijirō Umezu]] (梅津美治郎), commander of the [[Japanese China Garrison Army]] and [[Kenji Doihara]]'s (土肥原賢二) Japanese intelligence agency investigated and presented a memo to [[He Yingqing]]. Agreeing with the Japanese recommendations in this memo, all Chinese forces heavily influenced by the BSS (including military police, regular forces such as the 2nd Division and the 25th Division) should be evacuated from [[Beijing]] and out of [[Hebei]] province.

Taking over military training for the KMT, Feng Ti enrolled new members into the BSS. Hu Zongnan, Dai Li and other former BSS members also strengthened their grip on power by enrolling members into their own private armies. At the top were hundreds of Whampoa graduates, aided by some 30,000 mid- and low-level officers, university teachers and public servants. Below them were more than 200,000 members of the CRS. At the bottom were hundreds of thousands of boy scouts. With the organization undergoing such rapid expansion, corruption and inefficiency plagued the BSS across the country. Furthermore, in 1935, there was a serious security leak in its headquarters after the BSS tried to assassinate [[Wang Jingwei]], Chiang's presidential rival. Under heavy pressure, Feng Ti was sacked. Liu Jianquan took over, to be replaced in turn by Zheng Jiemin.

In 1936 Deng Wenyi became General Secretary of the BSS, just in time for December's [[Xi'an Incident]]. Chiang was kidnapped and held by General [[Zhang Xueliang]], who favored fighting the Japanese more than the CCP. There were disagreements between KMT leaders on whether to solve the kidnapping by peace talks or military action. In BSS meeting, He Zhonghan and Deng were determined to use force and called for the mobilization of BSS members around the country. 176 young generals issued a statement to denounce Zhang Xueliang and declare war on his army. Under He's direction, more than 2000 officers and BSS members held a meeting pledging their allegiance to Chiang and agreeing to mobilize against the Young Marshall. Gui Yongqing led an army of more than 12,000 men in armored vehicles across the [[Yangtze River]] towards where Chiang was being held, while a few [[bombers]] were launched by overzealous military and BSS officers. Chen and other KMT leaders refused to support this, however, and even He Yingqing, who was in charge of the KMT military, did not agree with the BSS's movement. No official support was given by the KMT.

Chiang's wife [[Soong Mei-ling]] came to Xian for peace talks. Due to the efforts of the CCP delegation, led by [[Zhou Enlai]], who wanted to set up an alliance with the KMT against the Japanese, Chiang was released several weeks later. After his release, Chiang took revenge on the BSS's reckless action and lack of control. Deng was sacked, with all titles removed again, and he was replaced by Kang Ze. He Zhonghan was out of favor with Chiang and forced to travel around Europe in exile. In March 1937, Chiang issued his order that all BSS activities be temporarily suspended.

With the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] breaking out on 7 July 1937, Japanese troops seized vast areas of China. Before Nanjing fell, Kang led the retreat of the BSS from its headquarters. In 1938 the BSS held its first and last national congress in Wuhan. Here, members of the BSS and SPTPP were permitted to have their memberships automatically transferred to the KMT, members of the CRS could be transferred to the Youth League of Three Principles of the People (三民主義青年團, YLTPP). Most of the 500,000 members of the BSS and CRS refused to transfer to the KMT, instead choosing the YLTPP, which became the basis of a new force within the KMT. Hu Zongnan kept the position of Director of the YLTPP, while Kang acted as his agent. The biggest winner was Dai Li: his new spy agency, the Military Statistical Bureau was formed, and he transferred all the intelligence agents of the BSS, CRS and NJSSD into it, giving him one of the largest intelligence services in the world. He kept control over this secret empire until his death in an airplane crash in 1946.

The BSS had been officially dismissed, but Kang wished to keep it alive under the cover of the YLTPP. In the following 7 years he increased YLTPP membership from 400,000 to more than 1.5 million, and used NJSSD techniques to re-organize the YLTPP. The result was a group more efficient and disciplined than the KMT, which aroused Chiang's suspicion again. After returning from the Soviet Union, Chiang Kai-shek's son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] sought to take over the YLTPP. Kang was reluctant and tried to resist these efforts, sealing his fate. In 1945 Kang was sent to Europe and Chiang Ching-kuo was given the YLTPP's seat. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], members of the YLTPP suffered the same fate as the KMT. Only prominent YLTPP figures such as Kang survived CCP purges, as examples of clemency toward war criminals.

==Legacy==
The following were some of the most prominent and earliest members of BSS.

Teng was later appointed as mayor of Nanjing. He went to Taiwan in 1945 with KMT troops and later retired from the position of chairman of Central Trust Bureau of the KMT. After years of retirement, he was appointed director of Labor Bureau. In 1949, when the KMT retreated to Taiwan, he was Minister of Communication and Policy Counsellor.

Liu's wife was an agent working for [[Kenji Doihara]], bringing many confidential documents with her on defecting to the Japanese. After this, Liu himself was forced to become a fugitive to escape Dai Li's secret police. After becoming a monk and spending years in [[Guizhou]], Chiang's men found him by chance. Chiang showed leniency by offering Liu a position as vice-speaker of the KMT Congress. When he went to Taiwan, Liu lived in poverty, and before his death in 1960s his last contribution was to provide valuable details for an article on the BSS written by an American professor.

Having risen and fallen several times, Deng showed little interest in politics after the Sino-Japanese War. He arrived in Taiwan in 1949 and retired as Director of the Political Work Bureau.

Feng Ti was appointed as commander of guard for [[Changsha]], but was executed in 1938 after KMT forces engaged in a [[scorched earth policy]] to resist the invasion of Japanese army. The resultant fires killed thousands of civilians

Kang returned from Europe during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and was sent to the battlefront. Captured and made a [[POW]], KMT propaganda depicted him as a martyr. In reality, Kang lived well in custody and defected to the CCP. In 1963 he was released in a CCP amnesty and died 4 years later.

Hu's troops were annihilated by CCP armies during the Civil War. When he left for Taiwan in 1949, he was impeached by 46 members of the KMT's [[Control Yuan]] for incompetence in military command. Although Hu was released with no charge, he was appointed a defense commander for a little island and never returned to central politics. After retiring, he died in 1962.

Zeng was captured and made a POW in the Civil War. Later released by the CCP, he died in 1983.

Gui was made commander of the KMT navy during the Civil War, then went to Taiwan. He died during his term as Chief of Staff of the KMT Army in 1954.

Dai Li became head of secret police and espionage of the KMT, and died in an air crash in 1946. His assistant, Zheng, succeeded Dai in running the KMT secret police. He died in 1959 in Taiwan.

'''''Britain's Secret Treasures''''' is a British documentary shown on ITV hosted by [[Michael Buerk]] and [[Bettany Hughes]].&lt;ref name="telegraph-2012-07-16"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Waters | first=Florence | title=Bettany Hughes on Britain’s Secret Treasures | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9397722/Bettany-Hughes-on-Britains-Secret-Treasures.html | newspaper=The Telegraph | date=16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The programme features fifty archaeological discoveries that have been made in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] by members of the public.&lt;ref name="itv"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Britain's Secret Treasures | url=http://www.itv.com/treasure/ | publisher=[[ITV plc|ITV]] | accessdate=2012-07-15 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128021305/http://www.itv.com/treasure/ | archivedate=28 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pas"&gt;{{Cite web | title=ITV and the British Museum to reveal the 50 greatest treasures discovered by the British public | url=http://finds.org.uk/news/stories/article/id/231 | publisher=[[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] | date=26 March 2012 | accessdate=2012-07-15 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608124442/http://finds.org.uk/news/stories/article/id/231 | archivedate=8 June 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the exception of a single find made in Scotland, all the objects featured were recorded by the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] (PAS).  Since the PAS was set up in 1997, some 800,000 objects have been registered with the scheme, many of them discovered by amateur [[metal detector]]ists.&lt;ref name="telegraph-2012-07-15"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Roya | first=Nikkhah | title=50 greatest national treasures revealed | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9400070/50-greatest-national-treasures-revealed.html | newspaper=The Telegraph | date=15 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifty finds have been selected by Hughes and a panel of experts from the [[British Museum]] ([[Roger Bland]], Michael Lewis, Sally Worrell and Ian Richardson) and the [[Council for British Archaeology]] (Mike Heyworth) from among the nearly one million finds reported to the PAS on the basis of their historical and cultural significance, as well as on their aesthetic merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=The selection panel for the top 50 finds | url=http://finds.org.uk/secrettreasures/thepanel | publisher=Portable Antiquities Scheme | accessdate=2012-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The six episodes of ''Britain's Secret Treasures'' present the fifty objects in reverse order according to their importance as judged by the panel, in a countdown format, with the ten most important objects revealed during the sixth and final episode.&lt;ref name="telegraph-2012-07-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent-2012-07-17"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Akbar | first=Arifa | title=Last night's viewing - Usain Bolt: the Fastest Man Alive, BBC1; Britain's Secret Treasures, ITV1 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/last-nights-viewing--usain-bolt-the-fastest-man-alive-bbc1-britains-secret-treasures-itv1-7946742.html | newspaper=The Independent | date=17 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking the top slot in the countdown, as the most important object according to the panel, is a [[Lower Paleolithic]] flint handaxe made more than half a million years ago that was found on a beach in [[Happisburgh]], Norfolk in 2000 by a man taking his dog for a walk.&lt;ref name="telegraph-2012-07-22"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Roya | first=Nikkhah | title=Prehistoric axe is Britain’s top treasure | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9417089/Prehistoric-axe-is-Britains-top-treasure.html | newspaper=The Telegraph | date=22 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venice - Winged lion 02.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Sculpture of a winged lion with an open book showing the words ''Pax tibi, Marce, Evangelista meus'' on a Venetian building]]
At the beginning of the series viewers were invited to submit photographs of objects that they had found in England or Wales, so that experts from the British Museum could select the most interesting object, to be announced during the final episode.&lt;ref name="itv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Send in your discoveries | url=http://finds.org.uk/secrettreasures/itv-sendin | publisher=Portable Antiquities Scheme | accessdate=2012-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The viewer-submitted object chosen as the most interesting by the panel was a small medieval bronze ornament in the form of an open book that was found in a field by the [[Pilgrims' Way]] at [[Bentley, Hampshire|Bentley]], Hampshire in 1997 (PAS record: [http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/1057 HAMP527]).  The open pages of the book are engraved with the Latin inscription ''Pax tibi, Marce, Evangelista meus'' meaning "Peace to you, Mark, my evangelist".  The traditional symbol of the [[Republic of Venice]] and the city of [[Venice]] is a [[Lion of Saint Mark|winged lion]] (symbol of [[Mark the Evangelist]]), which is often depicted with one of its paws on an open book showing this same inscription, which suggests that the bronze book may have been a pilgrim's souvenir from Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=The bronze booklet with the amazing story | url=http://www.itv.com:80/treasure//extras/bronzebooklet/ | accessdate=2012-07-23 }}{{dead link|date=February 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fates tapestry -460755563.jpg|thumb|''The Triumph of Death'', or ''The 3 Fates''. [[Flemish]] [[tapestry]] (probably Brussels, ca. 1510-1520). [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London]]

'''Clotho''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|θ|oʊ}}; {{lang-el|Κλωθώ}}) is one of the Three Fates or [[Moirai]] who spin (Clotho), draw out ([[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]) and cut ([[Atropos]]) the thread of Life in ancient Greek mythology.  Her Roman equivalent is [[Nona (mythology)|Nona]]. Clotho was responsible for spinning the thread of human life.  She also made major decisions, such as when a person was born, thus in effect controlling people's lives. This power enabled her not only to choose who was born, but also to decide when gods or mortals were to be saved or put to death. For example, Clotho brought Pelops back to life when his father boiled and killed him.

As one of the three fates her impact on Greek mythology was significant. Clotho, along with her sisters and [[Hermes]], was given credit for creating the alphabet for their people. Even though Clotho and her sisters were worshiped as goddesses, their representation of fate is more central to their role in mythology. Thread represented human life and her decisions represented the fate of all people in society.

==Origin==
According to Hesiod's Theogony, Clotho and her sisters ([[Atropos]] and [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]) were the daughters of [[Erebus]] (Darkness) and [[Nyx]] (Night), though later in the same work (ll. 901-906) they are said to have been born of [[Zeus]] and [[Themis]]. Clotho is also mentioned in the tenth book of the [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]] of [[Plato]] as the daughter of Necessity. In Roman mythology it was believed that she was daughter of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].

== The Ivory Shoulder ==
As one of the Three Fates, Clotho assisted Hermes in creating the alphabet, forced the goddess [[Aphrodite]] into making love with other gods, weakened the monster [[Typhon]] with poison fruit, persuaded Zeus to kill Asclepius with a bolt of lightning, and aided the gods in their war with the Giants by killing Agrius and Thoas with bronze clubs. Clotho also used her life-giving powers in the myth of [[Tantalus]], the man who had slain and prepared his son [[Pelops]] for a dinner party with the gods. When the gods had found out what Tantalus had done, they put the remaining pieces of Pelops in a cauldron.  Clotho brought him back to life, with the exception of his eaten shoulder, which was replaced by a chunk of ivory. Tantalus was then thrust into Hades for what he had done to his own kin. Clotho was worshiped in many places in Greece as one of the Three Fates and is sometimes associated with the Keres and Erinyes, which are other deity groups in Greek mythology. [[Ariadne]], the Greek goddess of fertility, is similar to Clotho in that she carries a ball of thread, much like Clotho's spindle.

== The Fooling of the Fates ==

Clotho, along with her sisters, was tricked into becoming intoxicated by [[Alcestis]]. Alcestis, who had two children with Admetus, became extremely saddened when Admetus became very sick and eventually died. Alcestis used Clotho's drunkenness to try to get her husband back. The Three Fates explained that if they were to find a replacement for Admetus then he could be released from the Underworld. A substitute was not found so Alcestis offered herself up to be the replacement in order to bring her husband back to life. As the agreement had been met, Alcestis quickly began to grow sick and sank into her grave as Admetus came back to life. At the last instant, [[Heracles]] arrived at the home of Admetus. When Death came to take Alcestis away, Heracles wrestled him and forced him to return Alcestis, allowing Admetus and Alcestis to be reunited.

== The Calydonian Boar Hunt ==

Although there does not seem to be an epic tale in Greek mythology in which the Fates are the main focus, they have played critical roles in the lives of gods and mortals. A tale in which the Fates played an integral part was that of [[Meleagros]] and the Brand, which [[W. H. D. Rouse]] describes in ''Gods, Heroes and Men of Ancient Greece''. Meleagros led a hunting party to slay the Calydonian Boar, which was set loose upon Calydon by Artemis.  She was displeased at the Calydonian king for neglecting to make a proper sacrifice to her. After slaying the boar, Meleagros presented the skin to a female member of the party, Atalanta, with whom he was smitten. His uncles were also part of the adventurous group, and they were upset by Meleagros' gift to Atalanta.  They believed a female should not have the skin of the boar. As a result of this disagreement, Meleagros slew his uncles, who were his mother's brothers. She was so enraged that she decided to take vengeance upon him.  She remembered a visit that the Fates had made a week after Meleagros was born. A Fate told Althaia that her son's life would expire when the burning log in the fireplace ceased to flame.  She promptly extinguished the flames, preserved it and hid it safely. In her rage over the loss of her brothers, she lit the log to punish Meleagros. As the log was consumed in flame, Meleagros burned to death.

{{Sociology}}

'''Comparative sociology''' involves comparison of the social processes between [[nation states]], or across different types of society (for example [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[socialist]]). There are two main approaches to comparative sociology: some seek similarity across different countries and cultures whereas others seek variance.  For example, [[structural Marxists]] have attempted to use comparative methods to discover the general processes that underlie apparently different social orderings in different societies.  The danger of this approach is that the different social contexts are overlooked in the search for supposed universal structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910157494|title=A dictionary of sociology|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scott, John, 1949-|isbn=9780191763052|edition= Fourth|location=Oxford|oclc=910157494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sociologist who employed comparative methods to understand variance was [[Max Weber]], whose studies attempted to show how differences between cultures explained the different social orderings that had emerged (see for example ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and [[Sociology of religion]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is some debate within sociology regarding whether the label of 'comparative' is suitable. [[Emile Durkheim]] argued in ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895) that all sociological research was in fact comparative since social phenomenon are always held to be typical, representative or unique, all of which imply some sort of comparison. In this sense, all sociological analysis is comparative and it has been suggested that what is normally referred to as comparative research, may be more appropriately called [[cross-national research]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first real collections of crystal models were produced by Romé de l'Isle. He actually offered sets of small (ca 3&amp;nbsp;cm) models made of "terra cotta" in order to stimulate the sales of the expensive 4 volume set of his book "Cristallographie" (1783).&lt;ref&gt;Romé de l'Isle, J-B. L. (1783) Cristallographie, ou description des formes propres à tous les corps du règne minéral, dans l'état de combinaison saline, pierreuse ou métallique. 4 Vols. Paris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Touret, L. (2004) Crystal models: milestone in the birth of crystallography and mineralogy as sciences in Dutch Pioneers of the Earth Sciences. Ed. by R.W. Visser and J. Touret, Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; The models were manufactured by his co-workers Arnould Carangeot, Lhermina and Swebach-Desfontaines, who produced numerous large sets (up to 448 models in each set). In order to exactly transfer interplanar angles from natural crystals to the terra cotta models, Carangeot invented and designed a prototype of a contact goniometer. This instrument, that proved to be an invaluable tool in geometric crystallography, enabled the measurement of interplanar angles with a precision of about half a degree.
[[Teylers Museum]] in Haarlem has a complete set of these terracotta models that were bought in Paris (in 1785) by [[Martin van Marum]], the first director of the museum. After over 200 years, this collection is still complete and in perfect condition at [[Teylers Museum]].

==René Just Haüy==
Almost two decades later, [[René Just Haüy]] introduced wooden crystal models to illustrate the two-dimensional drawings in the atlas volume of his "Traité de Minéralogie" (1801).&lt;ref&gt;Haüy, R.J. (1801) Traité de Minéralogie. 5 Vols. Paris&lt;/ref&gt; For the production of crystal models, wood appeared to be much more convenient than clay. Especially pear wood permitted getting smooth faces, sharp edges and accurate dihedral angles required for the production of these three-dimensional objects. In general, the angular accuracy was very high and some models, especially those illustrating crystal twins and Haüy's figures of decrement, still appear as masterpieces of fine woodwork and carving. Skilful craftsmen such as Pleuvin, Beloeuf and Lambotin (to name only a few) became specialists in this field and the models they offered were highly esteemed.

Between 1802–1804, [[Martin van Marum]] bought 597 of these pear wood models, 565 of these are still present in the collection of [[Teylers Museum]]. Each model is labeled, mentioning a number and the name of the crystal form. This set is the most complete collection of Haüy crystal models that still survives. That Van Marum was able to acquire such a unique collection was due to his networking. Van Marum allowed Haüy as a member of the Hollandsche Maatschappij, a nomination to which Haüy attached great value. Haüy mentioned this membership in all of his publications.

After their introduction by Romé de l'Isle and Haüy, crystal models were increasingly demanded both by scholars for teaching purposes as well as by mineral collectors. The quality of the models improved due to the technical progress in their production. Several mineralogists and crystallographers started designing their own series of models. Although pear wood kept a prominent place, models were also manufactured using materials like plaster, cast iron, lead, brass, glass, porcelain, cardboard, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, Curtis (2007) Mineralogy &amp; Crystallography: On the history of these sciences from beginnings through 1919. Tucson, Arizona&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Krantz Company==
In 1833, Adam August Krantz (who studied pharmacy and later "Geognosie" at the "Bergakademie Freiberg") founded the "Krantz" company in Bonn. Four years later, Krantz moved to Berlin and sold minerals, fossils, rocks and basically acquired a monopoly in the production of crystal models made of pear wood or walnut. Ever since its foundation, the firm was always in contact with renowned scientists and important collectors. Hence in 1880, Krantz proposed a series of 743 pear wood models compiled for teaching purposes by the crystallographer Paul Groth.&lt;ref&gt;Burchard, U. (1994, 1996) The P. Groth &amp; F. Krantz collection of 743 crystal models 1880 and The supplementary collection of 213 crystal models of P. Groth &amp; F. Krantz 1887 © Ulrich Burchard (Freising, Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years later, a supplementary collection of 213 models was available.

At the onset of the 20th century, Friedrich Krantz (a nephew of August Krantz, with a degree in mineralogy) supported by his teacher the crystallographer Carl Hintze, offered a collection of 928 models including most of the Groth models. Later, and along with many other productions, a Dana collection of 282 models was manufactured. Krantz offered a choice of collections of wooden models in different sizes (5, 10, 15–25&amp;nbsp;cm). In addition, he sold a variety of glass models having the crystallographic axes illustrated by colored silk threads or with the [[wiktionary:holohedral|holohedral]] form made of cardboard inside. Also available were models in massive cut and polished glass (colored and uncolored), cardboard models, wire crystal models, crystal lattice models, models with rotating parts, etc.
Over the years, Krantz published numerous detailed catalogues of the collections he offered; they constitute a precious documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Krantz F. (1913) Allgemeiner mineralogisch-geologischer Lehrmittel-Katalog für den Schulgebrauch. Katalog Nr 18. Zweite Auflage. I. Teil. Bonn [1913 and earlier editions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The widow claimed that she had only hired an accomplice to assault the deceased and not to kill him, but both were found guilty of murder.

The [[court]] considered the question of whether the [[Bloody hand|bloedige hand]] principle could be extended to cover [[insurance]] benefits owing to a nominated beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678515 bloedige hand principle] at papers.ssrn.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court held that public policy dictates that the principle should not be limited and accordingly extended its application to the statute.

 [[File:Declaration of arbroath.jpg|thumb|300px|The '[[Whitekirk and Tyninghame|Tyninghame]]' copy of the Declaration from 1320 AD]]
The '''Declaration of Arbroath''' is a declaration of [[Scottish independence]], made in 1320. It is in the form of a letter in [[Latin]] submitted to [[Pope John XXII]], dated 6 April 1320, intended to confirm [[Scotland]]'s status as an [[sovereign state|independent, sovereign state]] and defending Scotland's right to use military action when unjustly attacked.

Generally believed to have been written in the [[Arbroath Abbey]] by [[Bernard of Kilwinning]], then [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland|Chancellor of Scotland]] and [[Abbot of Arbroath]],{{sfn|Scott|1999|p=196}} and sealed by fifty-one [[magnate]]s and [[nobles]], the letter is the sole survivor of three created at the time. The others were a letter from the [[King of Scots]], [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]], and a letter from four Scottish bishops which all presumably made similar points.

== Overview ==
The Declaration was part of a broader diplomatic campaign which sought to assert Scotland's position as an independent kingdom,{{sfn|Barrow|1984}} rather than being a feudal land controlled by England's Norman kings, as well as lift the [[excommunication]] of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]].{{sfn|Lynch|1992}} The Pope had recognised [[Edward I of England]]'s claim to overlordship of Scotland in 1305 and Bruce was excommunicated by the Pope for murdering [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] before the altar in Greyfriars Church in Dumfries in 1306.{{sfn|Lynch|1992}}

The Declaration made a number of points: that Scotland had always been independent, indeed for longer than England; that [[Edward I of England]] had unjustly attacked Scotland and perpetrated atrocities; that Robert the Bruce had delivered the Scottish nation from this peril; and, most controversially, that the independence of Scotland was the prerogative of the Scottish people, rather than the King of Scots. In fact it stated that the nobility would choose someone else to be king if Bruce proved to be unfit in maintaining Scotland's independence.

==Debates==
Some have interpreted this last point as an early expression of '[[popular sovereignty]]'{{sfn|McLean|2005|p=247}} &amp;ndash; that government is contractual and that kings can be chosen by the community rather than by God alone. Modern Scottish nationalists point to the  “Declaration" as evidence of the long-term persistence of the Scots as a distinct national community, giving a very early date for the emergence of [[nationalism]]. However "the overwhelming majority of academics challenge this vision. Scholars point out that definitions change with time. The meaning ascribed to words similar to nation during the ancient and medieval periods was often quite different than it is today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Bevir, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Political Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfFWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA921|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that the Declaration was not a statement of popular sovereignty (and that its signatories would have had no such concept){{sfn|Kellas|1998|p=35}} but a statement of royal propaganda supporting Bruce's faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fugelso|first=Karl|title=Memory and medievalism|year=2007|publisher=D.S. Brewer|isbn=978-1-84384-115-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m542R9ygB3QC&amp;pg=PA138|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCracken-Flesher|first=Caroline|title=Culture, nation, and the new Scottish parliament |year=2006|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=978-0-8387-5547-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YInDkqRVQOwC&amp;pg=PA246|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; A justification had to be given for the rejection of [[John of Scotland|King John Balliol]] in whose name [[William Wallace]] and [[Andrew de Moray]] had rebelled in 1297.  The reason given in the Declaration is that Bruce was able to defend Scotland from English aggression whereas, by implication, King John could not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Allan Houston|author2=William Knox|author3=National Museums of Scotland|title=The new Penguin history of Scotland: from the earliest times to the present day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhQTAQAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Allen Lane}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|To this man, in as much as he saved our people, and for upholding our freedom, we are bound by right as much as by his merits, and choose to follow him in all that he does.}}
Whatever the true motive, the idea of a contract between King and people was advanced to the Pope as a justification for Bruce's coronation whilst John de Balliol still lived in Papal custody.{{sfn|Barrow|1984}}

==Signatories==
There are 39 names—eight [[earl]]s and thirty one [[baron]]s—at the start of the document, all of whom may have had their seals appended, probably over the space of some weeks and months, with nobles sending in their seals to be used. On the extant copy of the Declaration there are only 19 seals, and of those 19 people only 12 are named within the document. It is thought likely that at least 11 more seals than the original 39 might have been appended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The seals on the Declaration of Arbroath | publisher = National Archives of Scotland  | url = http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/doaSeals.asp | accessdate = 2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration was then taken to the [[papal court]] at [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] by Bishop Kininmund, Sir Adam Gordon and Sir Odard de Maubuisson.{{sfn|Barrow|1984}}

The Pope heeded the arguments contained in the Declaration, influenced by the offer of support from the Scots for his long-desired crusade if they no longer had to fear English invasion. He exhorted Edward II in a letter to make peace with the Scots, but the following year was again persuaded by the English to take their side and issued six bulls to that effect.{{sfn|Scott|1999|p=197}}

On 1 March 1328 the new [[English king]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] signed a [[peace treaty]] between Scotland and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]]. In this treaty, which was in effect for five years until 1333,  Edward renounced all English claims to Scotland. Eight months later, in October 1328, the interdict on Scotland, and the excommunication of its king, were removed by the Pope.{{sfn|Scott|1999|p=225}}

==Manuscript copies==
The original copy of the Declaration that was sent to Avignon is lost. A copy of the Declaration survives among Scotland's state papers, held by the [[National Archives of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/090401.asp National Archives of Scotland website feature]&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely known English language translation was made by [[Sir James Fergusson, 8th Baronet|Sir James Fergusson]], formerly [[Keeper of the Records of Scotland]], from text that he reconstructed using this extant copy and early copies of the original draft. 

[[G.W.S. Barrow]] has shown that one passage in particular, often quoted from the Fergusson translation, was carefully written using different parts of ''[[The Conspiracy of Catiline]]'' by the Roman author, [[Sallust]] (86–35 BC) as the direct source:&lt;ref&gt;G.W.S. Barrow, ‘The idea of freedom’, Innes Review 30 (1979) 16-34 (reprinted in G. W. S. Barrow, Scotland and its Neighbours in the Middle Ages (London, Hambledon, 1992), chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|...for, as long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule. It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom &amp;ndash; for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.}}

==List of signatories==

Listed below are the signatories of the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320.{{cn|date=April 2018}}&lt;!--need citation for the list of signers--&gt; Although it includes several consistent Bruce loyalists, it includes others who had opposed Bruce, or whom Bruce tried for plotting against him a few months later, and others of whom little is known.

The declaration itself is written in Latin. It uses the Latin versions of the signatories' titles, and in some cases the spelling of names has changed over the years.  This list generally uses the titles of the signatories' Wikipedia biographies.

US Senate Resolution 155 of 10 November 1997 states that the Declaration of Arbroath, the Scottish Declaration of Independence [sic], was signed on 6 April 1320 and the American Declaration of Independence was modeled on that inspirational document.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Congressional Record Senate Articles|url = https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/s12478-1?q=%257B%2522search%2522%253A%255B%2522resolution+155+tartan%2522%255D%257D&amp;resultIndex=1|website = www.congress.gov|access-date = 15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although [[United States Declaration of Independence#Influences and legal status|this influence is accepted by some historians]], it is disputed by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = 'For Freedom Alone': Review|last = Neville|first = Cynthia|date = April 2005|journal = The Scottish Historical Review|volume=84|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even advocates of the link concede that it is speculative and not based on any verifiable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowan|first=Edward J.|title=For Freedom Alone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wHWoAEACAAJ|year=2014|publisher=Birlinn General|isbn=978-1-78027-256-6}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assiti Shards universes ===
{{main|Assiti Shards series}}
The Assiti Shards refers to a literary mechanism which exchanges one volume of space-time with another. This manifests as both a time-swap and place-swap for the two places affected. The literary technique can be read about in detail in Assiti Shards effect, but when it first reached print in ''[[1632 (novel)|1632]]'', the technique spawned a huge surge of fan interest which is continuing to grow&lt;ref name="JBUsalestables"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baens-universe.com/articles/The_Economics_of_Writing |date=October 2007 |work=Jim Baen's Universe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716052311/http://www.baens-universe.com/articles/The_Economics_of_Writing |archivedate=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2007-10-17 |title=Column: Salvos Against Big Brother; article: 'The Economics of Writing' |quote=One note of explanation. I'm only using the paperback royalty figures because, for our purposes here, it's the paperback figures that are critical. A book that comes out first in a hardcover edition, followed by a paperback reissue, sees an almost complete stop to hardcover sales once the paperback appears. So you can't use hardcover royalty figures to gauge a book's longevity. {{aligned table|cols=4|style=line-height:1.1em|row1header=yes | Royalty period: | Total net sales | Sell-through | Period Sales | Dec-01 | 31237 | 85% | 31237 | Jun-02 | 31776 | 90% | 539 | Dec-02 | 41066 | 87% | 9290 | Jun-03 | 47535 | 87% | 6469 | Dec-03 | 54511 | 88% | 6976 | Jun-04 | 62306 | 89% | 7795 | Dec-04 | 67035 | 88% | 4729 | Jun-05 | 72071 | 88% | 5036 | Dec-05 | 77351 | 89% | 5280 | Jun-06 | 83437 | 89% | 6086 | Dec-06 | 94582 | 89% | 8145 }}
}}&lt;/ref&gt; now well over twelve years later. Flint had at least two other milieus planned utilizing the mechanism in 2000, but because of demand for [[work of art|works]] in the ''1632 universe'', he temporarily shelved them through the period 2001–05. They were known to be in production for some intervals in some part and manner in 2005–06, but the death of Jim Baen or other projects has apparently delayed them.

A fourth Assiti Shard effects tale, ''[[Time Spike]]'' was published in 2008.
In the late winter of 2005–06, Baen started listing all the 1632-verse books under the umbrella series title '''Assiti Shards series''' and continues to do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baen.com/series_list.asp |title=Baen Book's online series lists for Eric Flints by series |accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; after previously listing them under [[Ring of Fire (anthology)|Ring of Fire]], for the only series thus far published, so ''1632'' (numbering 10 works in print, thirty Gazettes (XXX came out in October 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grantvillegazette.com/ |title=Exploring Eric Flint&amp;#039;s world of 1632 |publisher=Grantvillegazette.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and climbing rapidly bi-monthly) is currently listed on Baen's under the pseudo [[misnomer]] ''Assiti Shards series'', of which there are (will be) four milieus planned, not just the original. Yet Amazon and Barnes and Noble lists "Ring of Fire" for some books in the series, and "Assiti Shards series" for others. As of early October 2007, the series name of the ''1632 books'' is still confused; Barnes and Noble has seemingly grouped them under ''Ring of Fire series'', Amazon and other web sellers are mixed, and the book covers of the last six hardcover releases avoid the question entirely on the dust jacket and artwork. At the moment, we use the term ''[[1632 series]]'', and other books in the series can be reached via that main article or by the navigation strip at the page bottom.

==== The 1632 series ====
{{main|1632 series}}
Once also known on the internet as the 163''x'' series, Baen for a time called the ''Ring of Fire series'', and it is as frequently called the ''1632 Universe'' or '''1632verse'''; however it is named, it is a best-selling success. The [[alternate history]] series starts when the inhabitants of a small town in the United States find themselves transported back to Central Germany, in the late spring (May) of 1631 with no way back. The first book title results because while the tale builds in 1631, the climax occurs when events in the [[Thirty Years' War]] nearly overrun the town in 1632.

:*''[[1632 (novel)|1632]]'', (2000) which successfully initiated the series. Primary characters and setting are in fictional [[Grantville (1632 series)|Grantville, West Virginia]], now part of [[Thuringia]].
:*''[[1633 (novel)|1633]]'' (2002) with [[David Weber]]; co-sequel with the following ''Ring of Fire'' anthology.
:*''[[Ring of Fire (anthology)|Ring of Fire]]'' (Jan 2004); first of many 1632 [[Western canon|canon]]ical anthologies, currently supplemented by the Grantville Gazettes. For a while the title of this work was used as the series name.
:*''[[1634: The Galileo Affair]]'' (April 2004) with [[Andrew Dennis]]; this work takes stories from four ''Ring of Fire'' short stories and launches the second major storyline (called a 'thread' by Flint), centered on Italy.
:*''Grantville Gazette I'' print release, November 2004
:*''Grantville Gazette II'' print release, March 2006
:*''[[1634: The Ram Rebellion]]'' (April 2006) with author-historian and key 1632 Research Committee member [[Virginia DeMarce]]. Together with stories from ''Ring of Fire'' and several Grantville Gazettes, this work takes a grassroots view at the peasants movement centered in Upper Palatinate, though it spends much time in [[Grantville, WV]].
:*''[[1634: The Baltic War]]'' (May 2007) with David Weber; writing schedule conflicts between Flint and Weber delayed this sequel. This novel closes out many loose ends left hanging in the Central Europe threads predecessor novel: ''1633''.

:*''[[The Grantville Gazettes]]''
:: The Grantville Gazettes began as an experimental (eMagazine) collated as an anthology featuring primarily fan fiction and non-fiction background essays similar to encyclopedia articles. These fact articles, which include reference sections, were developed by the various sub-committees of the ''very informal'' 1632 Research Committee and the input (feedback and criticisms) received on the internet web-forum [[1632 Tech Manual]] which is part of [[Baen's Bar]]. These essays and the feedback were pertinent to the developing milieu along with input from other established authors—a massive case of [[collaborative fiction]] writing—the foundation for which was in turn in part being developed on Baen's Bar by those same fans commenting, manning the committees, doing research much like contributing to a [[wiki]], and then submitting the results to [[Peer review]] and criticism on [[1632 Comments]] or [[1632 Tech Manual]]. This is an ongoing process, as is the mining of said research and the primarily fan writing which is still ongoing.

::The self-funding eMagazine Gazettes were edited by Eric Flint up through issue six (VI), who along with a volunteer Editorial Board, many who have been assisting him closely in designing the development of the milieu, building and running the canonical website 1632.org and the many research topics leading to decisions within the whole collaboration. While now using his assistant and direct employee Paula Goodlett as an assistant editor, Flint retains full editorial control of the 1632 milieu and all its intellectual property rights.

::The Grantville Gazette anthologies are also published by Baen, beginning with an initial publication as a serialized [[eMagazine]] over three months, followed by an e-book release (downloadable in various electronic formats) at Webscription.net, but a mass market [[Trade paperbacks|trade paperback]] edition of the first issue was published as an experiment in November 2004. The first printing sold out, and reprintings followed. The second issue was released in a Hardcover Edition in early March 2006, and also sold well.  Beginning with Issue 11 the Grantville Gazette has gone pro. It did go to a bimonthly schedule starting at May 1st 2007 and pays pro rates.

==Closure==
In February 2002, [[United Business Media]], who had owned the Gavin Report since 1992, decided to close the publication. Gavin executives cited a lack of cooperation on the part of media conglomerates (specifically naming [[Clear Channel Communications]] and [[Infinity Broadcasting]]), as well as poor convention attendance as reasons for the closure.&lt;ref name=SFC2/&gt;

[[File:Hardesty's Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Hardesty's Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia'', "Special Virginia Edition" (1884)]]
'''''Hardesty's Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia''''' was a voluminous late 19th century American encyclopedia produced by H.H. Hardesty &amp; Company, publishers, of [[Chicago]] and [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]. A massive work with enormous amount of textual and statistical data, it went through various editions and variations throughout the 1880s, with some special editions focusing on areas of special regional significance. (''E.g.'', a stand-alone military history under the title ''The Military History of Ohio'' in special county editions which did not include the more general information in the main ''Encyclopedia'', but included the state’s general military history in addition to a specific county’s military history. Another example was the ''Special Virginia Edition'' giving a history of the Virginias, written by R.A. Brock, secretary of the [[Virginia Historical Society]].) 

The main edition of the ''Encyclopedia'' contained large scale copper plate maps of each state and territory of the United States; and the provinces of Canada; a reference map of the world; a topographical and railroad map of the United States; thirteen comprehensive maps of Bible geography; a general survey of the world; history of the United States; each state and territory; Declaration of Independence; sketches of the Signers, with portraits; and of Presidents. County editions (typically 2 or 3 counties per volume) include brief county histories and brief biographies of early or pioneering county residents.

Hardesty printed about 10,000 copies of main edition, 2,000 copies of the Virginia/West Virginia supplement, and subsequently prepared local historical (county) material for very limited editions of about 250 copies each.

[[File:Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae frontispiece.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece]]

'''''Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae''''' is an 1813 publication by the [[botanical illustrator]] [[Ferdinand Bauer]].

Bauer was scientific illustrator on board {{HMS|Investigator|1801|6}} during [[Matthew Flinders]]' exploration of Australia, and as such he worked closely with the expedition's naturalist, [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]]. When these men returned to England in 1805, they brought with them thousands of specimens and hundreds of sketches. Initially, they planned to publish a large-scale work, to be entitled ''Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae'', but this venture failed, and Brown decided to publish his scientific descriptions separately, in ''[[Transactions of the Linnean Society of London]]'', and later his own ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]]''. Bauer then undertook to publish a lesser work himself, with Brown providing text limited to a brief preface and some captioning.&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"&gt;{{cite book | first = Helen | last = Hewson | year = 1999 | title = Australia: 300 years of botanical illustration | publisher=CSIRO Publishing | location = Collingwood, Victoria | isbn = 0-643-06366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusually, Bauer not only did all the illustrations, but also engraved the printing plates and hand-coloured the illustrations. It was exceedingly unusual for a single artist to perform all three roles; it is said that Bauer did the engraving himself because he could not find a good engraver, and previous works of his were disappointing because of incompetent engraving.&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"/&gt;

Three issues of ''Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae'' were published, all in 1813. These three issues totalled fifteen plates, and a sixteenth was bound into some copies. Publication then ceased, probably because the venture was a financial failure.&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"/&gt; It is estimated that less than fifty copies of the work were sold, and some of these were uncoloured. It is therefore now an extremely rare book. In 1997, a copy was sold at [[Christie's]] for $57,000.&lt;ref name="biodiversitylibrary"&gt;{{cite web | title = Bauer, Ferdinand | url = https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/creator/450 | accessdate = 14 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">The '''King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre''' is a region in the city of [[Riyadh]], the capital of [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is not the "historic center" of the city as this lies to the south around [[Masmak]] fort and the main Friday Mosque" in the Dira district. The origin of the ''King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre'' is the former compound of [[Murabba Palace|the Murabba' Palace]], that was built in 1936/37 by [[Ibn Saud|King Abdul Aziz]] about one and a half kilometers to the north of the old city and well outside of the then still existing city walls. 

After 1953 the palace compound ceased to be used as main royal residence and slowly fell into dissuse. The "Murabba' Development Project" was later started to make use of the area for projects involved with the ''Centennial Celebrations'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=9686 Project] listed at Archnet.&lt;/ref&gt; As such the area was chosen to be the site of several cultural institutions focusing on the national history in general and the history of the current Saudi State and its founder in detail. Consequently what had remained of the old palace compound buildings was restored or remodeled on plans similar to the original buildings. The surrounding area was made into a landscape of parks and plazas and new buildings were built such as the [[National Museum of Saudi Arabia]].

The units on the west side of the area are from south to north: A remodeled mosque, the old original Murabba' Palace with main Diwan renovated as "living museum", the "Memorial Hall" on the outlines of an old courtyard house, a modern exhibition hall for the car collection, on the footprints of the old majlis and assembly hall the new Al-Dara main lobby and multipurpose hall, a documentation center with a separated men's and women's library each, an art gallery and a large internal garden. On the east side the new ''National Museum of Saudi Arabia'' was built together with the [[King Abdul Aziz Foundation for Research and Archives]]. To the south the area around the old water tower has been remodelled and now includes a small theme park. The whole project is said to have cost some 680 million Saudi riyals (about 181.33 million U.S. dollars at the time)&lt;ref&gt;''Saudi Arabia Celebrates the Centennial of a Historic Event'' in the [http://www.saudiembassy.net/Publications/MagWinter99/centennial.htm Saudi Arabia Magazine Winter 1999, Volume 15, Number 4]&lt;/ref&gt; and covers an area of some 360,000 square meters (3,000,000 sq ft).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199901/saudi.arabia.s.centennial.the.centennial.s.jewel.riyadh.htm ''Saudi Arabia’s Centennial: The Centennial’s Jewel—Riyadh''] by Arthur Clark in [[Saudi Aramco World]], issue 1 from 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1893">In '''''Lipschitz and Another NNO v Wolpert and Abrahams''''' an important case in South African law, the auditors of a company in liquidation were sued under section 184 of the Companies Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 61 of 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; to contribute an amount in excess of R3 million to the company's assets as compensation. An exception was successfully filed to the particulars of claim on the basis that an auditor, appointed under section 98 (1) of the 1926 Companies Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 46 of 1926&lt;/ref&gt; was not an "officer of the company" within the meaning of the phrase in section 184 (1). Holmes JA quoted&lt;ref&gt;739E-G.&lt;/ref&gt; section 184(1) to the following effect:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Where in the course of winding-up a company it appears that any person who has taken part in the formation or promotion of the company, or any past or present director, manager or liquidator, or ''any officer of the company'', has misapplied or retained or become liable or accountable for any money or property of the company, or been ''guilty of any misfeasance or breach of trust'' in relation to the company, the Court may, on the application of the Master or of the liquidator or of any creditor or contributory, examine into the conduct of the promoter, director, manager, liquidator, or officer, and compel him to repay or restore the money or property or any part thereof, respectively with interest at such rate as the Court thinks just, or to ''contribute such sum to the assets of the company by way of compensation'' in respect of the ''misapplication, retention, misfeasance or breach of trust'' as the Court thinks just.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes JA's italics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Molecular Imaging and Contrast Agent Database (MICAD) is a freely accessible online source of information on ''in vivo'' [[molecular imaging]] agents. It was established as a key component of the "Molecular Libraries and Imaging" program of the NIH Roadmap, a set of major inter-agency initiatives accelerating medical research and the development of new, more specific therapies for a wide range of diseases.

MICAD includes agents developed for imaging modalities such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), single photon emission computed tomography ([[SPECT]]), magnetic resonance imaging ([[MRI]]), [[ultrasound]], computed tomography, [[optical imaging]], and planar gamma imaging. It contains textual information, references, numerous links to MEDLINE and to other relevant resources from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

MICAD is edited by a team of scientific editors and curators at the National Library of Medicine, NIH. It is being developed under the guidance of a trans-NIH panel of experts in the field. Members of the imaging community are invited to contribute to the MICAD database by writing and submitting entries (chapters) on agents of their choice for online publication. The MICAD staff will work with individual guest authors to prepare the chapters. Interested members of the imaging community should contact the MICAD staff at micad@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

A '''minority language''' is a [[language]] spoken by a [[minority group|minority]] of the [[population]] of a territory. Such people are termed linguistic minorities or language minorities. With a total number of 193 [[sovereign state]]s recognized internationally (as of 2008)&lt;ref&gt;ONU members&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated number of roughly 5,000 to 7,000 [[List of languages by name|languages]] spoken worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics|title = Ethnologue statistics|website = Summary by world area {{!}} Ethnologue|publisher = SIL|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; it follows that the vast majority of languages are minority languages in every country in which they are spoken. Some minority languages are simultaneously also [[official language]]s, including the [[Irish language]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Likewise, some [[national language]]s are often considered minority languages, insofar as they are the national language of a [[stateless nation]].

==Law and international politics==

===Europe===
[[File:European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages membership.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|{{legend|#008000|Member states that have signed and ratified the charter.}}{{Legend|#00ff00|Member states that have signed but not ratified the charter.}}{{legend|white|Member states that have neither signed nor ratified the charter.}}{{legend|#c0c0c0|Non-member states of the Council of Europe.}} Source: the [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=148&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG list of signatories] at the [[Council of Europe]] website.]] 
;Definition
For the purposes of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]:
:''"regional or minority languages" means languages that are: ''
#''traditionally used within a given territory of a State by nationals of that State who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the State's population; and ''
#''different from the official language(s) of that State''

In most European countries the minority languages are defined by [[legislation]] or [[constitution]]al documents and afforded some form of official support. In 1992, [[Council of Europe]] adopted [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] to protect and promote historical [[regional language|regional]] and minority languages in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The signatories that have not yet ratified it as of 2012 are [[Azerbaijan]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (since Irish is the first official language and there are no other minority languages),  [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malta]], [[Moldova]], and [[Russia]].

===Canada===
In Canada the term appears in the [[Constitution of Canada]] in the heading above [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which guarantees [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official language]] minority communities educational rights. In Canada, the term "minority language" is generally understood to mean whichever of the official languages is less spoken in a particular province or territory (i.e., English in Québec, French elsewhere).

==Politics==
Minority languages may be marginalised within nations for a number of reasons. These include having a relatively small number of speakers, a decline in the number of speakers, and popular belief of them as uncultured, primitive, or simple dialects when compared to the dominant language. Support for minority languages is sometimes viewed as supporting separatism, for example the ongoing revival of the Celtic languages ([[Irish language|Irish]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]]). Immigrant minority languages are often also seen as a threat and as indicative of the non-integration of these communities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Both of these perceived threats are based on the notion of the exclusion of the majority language speakers. Often this is added to by political systems by not providing support (such as education and policing) in these languages.

Speakers of majority languages can and do learn minority languages, through the large number of courses available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Languages with Courses Available|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=12 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether most students of minority languages are members of the minority community re-connecting with the community's language, or others seeking to become familiar with it.

===Controversy===
There is a difference of views as to whether the protection of official languages by a state representing the majority speakers violates or not the human rights of minority speakers. In March 2013, Rita Izsák, UN Independent Expert on minority issues, said that "protection of linguistic minority rights is a human rights obligation and an essential component of good governance, efforts to prevent tensions and conflict, and the construction of equal and politically and socially stable societies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44352 |title=Protection of minority languages is a human rights obligation, UN expert says |publisher=UN News Centre |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=30 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Slovakia for example, the Hungarian community generally considers the 'language law' enacted in 1995 discriminative and inconsistent with the European Charter for the Protection of Regional or Minority languages, while majority Slovakians view that minority speakers' rights are guaranteed in accordance with the highest European standards and not discriminated against by the preferential status of the state language. The language law declares that "the Slovakian language enjoys a preferential status over other languages spoken on the territory of the Slovakian Republic" and as a result of a 2009 amendment, a fine of up to €5,000 may be imposed for a misdemeanor from the regulations protecting the preferential status of the state language, e.g. if the name of a shop or a business is indicated on a sign-board first in the minority language and only after it in Slovakian, or if in a bilingual text the minority language part is written with bigger fonts than its Slovakian equivalent, or if the bilingual text on a monument is translated from the minority language to the dominant language and not vice versa, or if a civil servant or doctor communicates with a minority speaker citizen in a minority language in a local community where the proportion of the minority speakers is less than 20%.{{citation needed |date=March 2014 }}

[[Sign languages]] are often not recognized as true natural languages even though they are supported by extensive research.

Speakers of [[auxiliary languages]] have also struggled for their recognition, perhaps partly because they are used primarily as second languages and have few native speakers.

==Lacking recognition in some countries==
Languages that have the status of a national language and are spoken by the majority population in at least one country, but lack recognition in countries where there is a significant minority linguistic community:
*[[Albanian language|Albanian]] - recognized minority language in many countries including [[Romania]], but not recognized as a minority language in [[Greece]] - where 4% are ethnic Albanians.
*[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] - recognized minority language in the [[Czech Republic]] (4,300 speakers), not officially recognized as minority language in [[Greece]].
*[[German language|German]]: official in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]], minorities elsewhere in Europe, with recognition in [[South Tyrol]], but no recognition in [[France]].
*[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: official in [[Hungary]], co-official in Serbia's [[Vojvodina]] province (293,000 speakers), recognized minority language in the [[Czech Republic]] (14,000 speakers), lacking official status in [[Romania]] (1,447,544 speakers, 6.7% of the population), [[Slovakia]] (520,000 speakers, approximately 10% of the population) and [[Ukraine]] (170,000 speakers),
*[[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] - Macedonian is not recognized as minority language in [[Greece]] and [[Bulgaria]].
*[[Polish language|Polish]] - recognized minority language in the [[Czech Republic]] (51,000 speakers), not officially recognized as minority language in [[Lithuania]].
*[[Romanian language|Romanian]]: official in Romania, co-official in [[Vojvodina]] (30,000 speakers), recognized minority language in the [[Czech Republic]] (1,200 speakers), lacking official status in [[Serbia]] (2011 census - 35,330 &lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;http://media.popis2011.stat.rs/2011/prvi_rezultati.pdf Serbian Preliminary 2011 Census Results&lt;/ref&gt; estimated 250,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ron |title=Romanian |publisher=[[Ethnologue]] |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;) northwestern [[Bulgaria]] (estimated 10,566 speakers) and in [[Ukraine]] (estimated 450,000 speakers).
*[[Russian language|Russian]]: official in [[Russia]], co-official in [[Belarus]] and [[Kazakhstan]], lacking official status in [[Ukraine]], [[Estonia]], and [[Latvia]] (more than 25% of the population in the latter two).
*[[Serbian language|Serbian]]: official in [[Serbia]], co-official in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Kosovo]], and minority status in [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], [[Czech Republic]], and [[Romania]]. The minority status in [[Montenegro]] is controversial since the majority of the population (63.49%) declared Serbian as their mother tongue, and Serbian having been official until 2007.

==Languages having no majority worldwide==
Linguistic communities that form no majority in any country, but whose language has the status of an official language in at least one country:
*[[Tamil language|Tamil]]: 78 million speakers, official status in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Singapore]]   
*[[Berber language|Berber]]:  45 million speakers, official status in [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], and [[Libya]]
*[[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]:  22 million speakers, official status in [[Iraq]]
*[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]: 13 million first or second language speakers (16 million speakers with basic knowledge), official status in [[South Africa]], recognized regional language in [[Namibia]]
*[[Catalan language|Catalan]]: 9 million speakers, official status in [[Andorra]], regional official status in [[Catalonia]], the [[Valencian Community]] under the name of Valencian, and the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Spain]]. Recognized regional language in [[Italy]], and specifically on the island of [[Sardinia]] in [[Alghero]]. It has no official status in [[Northern Catalonia]], [[France]].
*[[Dutch Low Saxon]]: 4.8 million speakers, a minority language in the Netherlands, but also in Germany.

*[[Frisian languages]]: 400,000 speakers, regional official in [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]] and [[Germany]].
*[[Irish language|Irish]]: 291,470 native speakers (1.66 million with some knowledge), official status in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and an officially recognised minority language in the [[United Kingdom]].
*[[Māori language|Māori]]: 157,110 speakers, official status in [[New Zealand]]
*[[Romansh language|Romansh]]: 60,000 speakers, official status in [[Switzerland]] ([[Graubünden]]).
*[[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]: 22,500 speakers, official status within the [[Cherokee Nation]] of [[Oklahoma]]

==Treasure Language==

A '''treasure language''' is one of the thousands of small languages still spoken in the world today. The term was proposed by the [[Rama people]] of Nicaragua as an alternative to [[heritage language]], [[indigenous language]], and "ethnic language", names that are considered pejorative in the local context.&lt;ref name="Grinevald"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grinevald |first1=Colette |last2=Pivot |first2= Bénédicte |editor-last1=Jones |editor-first1=Mari |editor-last2=Ogilvie |editor-first2=Sarah |title=Keeping Languages Alive: Documentation, Pedagogy and Revitalization |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2013 |chapter=On the revitalization of a ‘treasure language’: The Rama Language Project of Nicaragua |chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/5387106/The_Revitalization_of_a_Treasure_Language_the_Rama_Language_Project_of_Nicaragua |doi=10.1017/CBO9781139245890.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now also used in the context of public storytelling events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Languages Treasured but Not Lost  |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/languages-treasured-but-not-lost/Content?oid=4679610 |work=East Bay Express |location=Oakland |date=2016-02-17 |access-date=2017-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "treasure language" references the desire of speakers to sustain the use of their mother tongue into the future:
{{Quote|text=[The] notion of treasure fit the idea of something that had been buried and almost lost, but was being rediscovered and now shown and shared. And the word treasure also evoked the notion of something belonging exclusively to the Rama people, who now attributed it real value and had become eager and proud of being able to show it to others.&lt;ref name="Grinevald"/&gt;}}

Accordingly, the term is distinct from [[endangered language]] for which objective criteria are available, or [[heritage language]] which describes an end-state for a language where individuals are more fluent in a dominant language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Hale |editor-first1=Kenneth |editor-last2=Hinton |editor-first2=Leanne |title=The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |date=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2063">'''''Mlombo v Fourie'''''&lt;ref&gt;1964 (3) SA 350 (T).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important and contentious case in [[South Africa]]n [[South African property law|property]] [[South African law|law]]. It was heard before Trollip J in the [[Gauteng_Division |Transvaal Provincial Division]] on May 29, 1964.

== Facts ==
Mlombo, the owner of the property, instituted the ''[[rei vindicatio]]'' action against Fourie for having fraudulently ceased to possess it.

== Judgment ==
The court ordered Fourie to make good the value of the lost property.

== Criticism ==
The decision has been criticised by legal commentators for having blurred the distinction between the ''rei vindicatio'' and the ''[[South_African_property_law#Actio_ad_exhibendum |actio ad exhibendum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mostert &amp; Pope 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Badenhorst ''et al'' 246.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''rei vindicatio'', or vindicatory action, is a remedy available to an owner to reclaim his property, from wherever it is found and from whosoever is holding it, entitling him to "exclusive possession."&lt;ref&gt;Mostert &amp; Pope 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The true application of the remedy is aimed merely at restoring proprietary interest; it does not include damages.&lt;ref&gt;Mostert &amp; Pope 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''actio ad exhibendum'', which is a [[South_African_property_law#Actio_ad_exhibendum |delictual remedy]], usually does include a claim for damages. By awarding damages in terms of the ''rei vindicatio'', which is a restorative proprietary remedy, the court failed to appreciate this distinction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2068">The '''modernisation losers thesis''', or '''modernisation losers theory''', is a theory associated with the academic [[Hans-Georg Betz]] that posits that individuals support [[far-right politics|far-right]] political parties because they wish to undo changes associated with [[modernisation theory|modernisation]].

The modernisation losers theory has been seen as a combination of two theories (a) the relative deprivation theory and (b) the social breakdown theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bäckman | first = Malin | title = Losers of modernization or modernization winners? | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100635/https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/34144/1/gupea_2077_34144_1.pdf | archive-date = 2 April 2015 | url = https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/34144/1/gupea_2077_34144_1.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[University of Gothenburg|Gothenburg University Publications Electronic Archive]] | date = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Betz suggests that the move from an industrial to [[post-industrial economy]] is one aspect of this 'modernisation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Betz | first = Hans-Georg | title = Radical right-wing populism in Western Europe | publisher = St. Martins Press | location = New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780312121952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic Jens Rydgren describes the thesis as 'one of the central tenets in the literature on the new radical right-wing parties'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rydgren | first1 = Jens | last2 = Ruth | first2 = Patrick | title = Voting for the radical right in Swedish municipalities: social marginality and ethnic competition?| journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | page = 206 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2011.00269.x | date = September 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2011.00269.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3279">The '''National Corpus of Polish''' (Polish : Narodowy Korpus Języka Polskiego NKJP) is the biggest and the most important [[text corpus|corpus]] of the [[Polish language]]. A linguistic corpus is a collection of texts where one can find the typical use of a single word or a phrase, as well as their meaning and grammatical function.

==Description==

The National Corpus of Polish is a shared initiative of four institutions: Institute of Computer Science and the Institute of the Polish Language at the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], [[Polish Scientific Publishers]] PWN, and the Department of Computational and Corpus Linguistics at the [[University of Łódź]]. It has been registered as a research-development project of the [[Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Poland|Ministry of Science and Higher Education]].

The intended size of the whole National Corpus of Polish is over 1 billion words, of which a 300-million word subcorpus has been carefully balanced, and a manually-annotated 1-million corpus has been released under an open license.  The corpus is accessible online at http://nkjp.pl/poliqarp/

The corpus contains classic literature, daily newspapers, specialist periodicals and journals, transcripts of conversations, and a variety of short-lived and internet texts.&lt;ref&gt;http://nkjp.pl/index.php?page=0&amp;lang=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search Engines==

* PELCRA – 1200 million words from three corpora : IPIPAN, PELCRA, PWN. It is easy to use and the results can be downloaded in the form of spreadsheets. A special query syntax also allows the use of morphological expansion and spelling, the search in one query options and flexible lexical phraseological compounds. PELCRA offers also a visualization of the registry function and the generation of time series for words, phrases and idioms.
* [[Poliqarp|POLIQARP]] – Poliqarp gives the ability to search for specific words or phrases. It also allows to find the sequence determined using regular expressions, for example, all occurring in the body of phrases consisting of a noun and an adjective or all of the grammatical forms of the selected word (especially useful for studies on the Polish language.) These operations, both online and offline, can be executed pretty quickly – e.g. simple search queries take no more than a few seconds.

==History==

The first corpus to emerge was developed by the Institute of the Polish Language, [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (not publicly available), followed by the corpus of PWN publishers, then the corpus of the PELCRA group at the University of Łódź, and finally the corpus of the Institute of Computer Science, Polish Academy of Science. All four teams decided to join forces in 2006, forming the Consortium for the National Corpus of Polish.&lt;ref&gt;http://nkjp.pl/settings/papers/NKJP_ACADEMIA2009_pl.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Orleans Mint''' ({{lang-fr|'''Monnaie de La Nouvelle-Orléans'''}}) operated in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], as a branch [[Mint (coin)|mint]] of the [[United States Mint]] from 1838 to 1861 and from 1879 to 1909. During its years of operation, it produced over 427 million [[gold]] and [[silver]] coins of nearly every [[United States coinage|American denomination]], with a total face value of over [[United States dollar|US$]] 307 million.&lt;ref&gt;This refers to literally the face value of all the coins produced by the Mint added up. For example, the 720,000 3-cent pieces produced by the mint have a face value of US$0.03 x 720,000 = US$21,600.00. It does not reflect the value of coinage adjusted for inflation, nor does it account for the coins' numismatic value for collectors.&lt;/ref&gt; It was closed during most of the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].

After it was decommissioned as a mint, the building has served a variety of purposes, including as an [[assay office]], a [[United States Coast Guard]] storage facility, and a [[fallout shelter]].

Since 1981 it has served as a branch of the [[Louisiana State Museum]]. Damaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, after over two years of repairs and renovations, the museum reopened in October 2007.

Exhibits include instruments used by some of New Orleans' notable [[jazz]] musicians, photographs, and posters, now part of the '''[[New Orleans Jazz Museum]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Orleans Jazz Museum at the Old U.S. Mint|url=http://louisianastatemuseum.org/museums/new-orleans-jazz-museum-the-old-us-mint/|publisher=Louisiana State Museum|accessdate=21 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222070102/http://louisianastatemuseum.org/museums/new-orleans-jazz-museum-the-old-us-mint/|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site is also a performance venue for jazz concerts, in partnership with the [[New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park]] and the private Music at the Mint organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plan Your Visit|url=http://www.nps.gov/jazz/planyourvisit/index.htm|publisher=New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official site|url=http://musicatthemint.org/|publisher=Music at the Mint|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Louisiana Historical Center''' is located on the third floor of the building.  The center includes collections of colonial-era manuscripts and maps, and primary and secondary source materials in a wide range of media. It is open to anyone with an interest in Louisiana history and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louisiana Historical Center|url=http://musicatthemint.org/colonial-documents-2/|publisher=Music at the Mint|accessdate=22 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430055314/http://musicatthemint.org/colonial-documents-2/|archivedate=30 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Orleans Mint has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]], and it is the oldest extant structure to have served as a U.S. Mint. Along with the [[Charlotte Mint]], it is one of two former mint facilities in the U.S. to house an [[art gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.themintmuseums.org/general_info_history.php this official page] on the Charlotte Mint's history.

== History ==

=== Antebellum period, 1835–1861 ===

==== Background ====
[[Image:NO Mint Plans.jpg|thumb|250px|This photo from the Louisiana State Museum in the old U.S. Mint shows the original 1835 plans for the building by William Strickland. The Mint building retains this basic W-shaped design today.]]

The rapidly growing United States in the early 1830s experienced a shortage of coins. It is estimated that in 1830 there was one small silver coin (quarter, dime or half dime) per person.  Also, production of silver dollars was suspended in 1804 because they were being exchanged for underweight Spanish coins in the [[West Indies]].  That left the half-dollar as the largest denomination of circulating coin being minted in the U. S.  Foreign coins were being circulated in the U. S. to alleviate the shortage.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Philadelphia Mint]] had been the only U. S. mint until 1838, when operations began at the first branch mints. 
  
In 1832 [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Jackson]] had [[veto]]ed a rechartering of the [[Second Bank of the United States]], an institution which he felt extended [[credit (finance)|credit]] to [[Northeastern United States|northeastern]] commercial [[business magnate|tycoons]] at the expense of the ordinary frontiersmen of the [[South Central United States|Old Southwest]], a region with which Jackson, a [[Tennessee|Tennessean]], strongly identified. In 1836 Jackson had issued an [[executive order (United States)|executive order]] called the [[Specie Circular]] which demanded that all land transactions in the United States be conducted in cash. Both of these actions, combined with the economic depression following the [[Panic of 1837]] (caused partly by Jackson's fiscal policies) increased the domestic need for minted money.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas Bailey, David Kennedy, And Lizabeth Cohen, ''The American Pageant: A History of the Republic'', 11th ed. (Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1998), 276–9, 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, in 1835 the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Federal Government]] established three branch mints: the [[Charlotte Mint]] in North Carolina, the [[Dahlonega Mint]] in Georgia and the New Orleans Mint.  Dahlonega and Charlotte were in gold mining regions and these mints produced only gold coins.  New Orleans was selected because of the city's strategic location along the Mississippi River which made it a vitally important center for commercial activity, including the export of cotton from the area's plantations. Large quantities of gold from [[Mexico]] also passed through [[Port of New Orleans|its port]] annually.

In the early 19th century, New Orleans, which was the fifth-largest city in the United States until the Civil War,&lt;ref&gt;Behind New York City, Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt; conducted more foreign trade than any other city in the nation. It was also located relatively near to gold deposits recently discovered in [[Alabama]]. While the [[Philadelphia Mint]] produced a substantial quantity of coinage, in the early 19th century it could not disperse the money swiftly to the far regions of the new nation, particularly the South and [[Midwestern United States|West]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Old U.S. Mint: A Historic Property of the Louisiana State Museum.'' Brochure. New Orleans: Louisiana State Museum, c. 2005. n.p. (second page).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the other two Southern branch mints, which only minted gold coinage, the New Orleans Mint produced both gold and silver coins, and in much greater quantities and total value, which marked it as the most important branch mint in the country until the [[San Francisco Mint]] began minting a large monetary value of gold coins in the mid 1850s.

The Mint's location occupies a prominent place in civic history. It sits at one of the two [[Mississippi River|River]] corners of the [[French Quarter]], which had been the entire city, or ''Vieux Carré'', of New Orleans.  Under [[Louisiana (New France)|French]] and [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish]] rule this location was home to one of the city's defensive [[fortification]]s. In 1792 the Spanish governor, [[Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet]], erected Fort San Carlos (later [[Fort St. Charles]]) here. The fort was demolished in 1821; and the nearby area was later named [[Jackson Square (New Orleans)|Jackson Square]] in honor of Andrew Jackson. As a general in the [[United States Army]], Jackson's leadership had saved the city from invading [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] forces during December 1814 and through January 8, 1815, the date of the famous [[Battle of New Orleans]], the last significant battle of the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;Greg Lambousy, "The Mint At New Orleans." ''Numismatist'' (March, 2003), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Architectural history ====

===== Design and construction =====
[[Image:NO Mint Courtyard.jpg|thumb|250px|View through a window in the old U.S. Mint showing one of the rear courtyards]]
[[Image:NO Mint Catalan Arches.jpg|thumb|250px|Shallow jack arches between steel I-beams provide the structural support for the floors of the Mint.]] [[Image:NO Mint Smokestack.jpg|thumb|250px|An illustration by [[Alfred R. Waud]] from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' in 1867 showing the [[flue gas stack|smokestack]] built behind the New Orleans Mint. Remains of the smokestack's foundation can still be seen today.]] 
The Mint building, which was constructed in red brick, was designed by architect [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] style, like most 19th-century public buildings in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;George Greenlief Evans, ''Illustrated History of the United States Mint'' (Philadelphia: G. G. Evans, 1885; new revised edition, 1894), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Strickland was a student of the architect [[Benjamin Latrobe]], a disciple of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] who had helped design the [[United States Capitol]] building in [[Washington, D.C.]] Strickland himself, based in [[Philadelphia]], had already designed the Philadelphia Mint building and the Second Bank of the United States, and would design the [[Charlotte Mint|Charlotte]] and [[Dahlonega Mint|Dahlonega]] facilities, making him the architect of the first four U.S. mint buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Lambousy, 38–9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gordon (Louisiana)|Martin Gordon]]&lt;!--Gordon previously served as Collector of the Port of New Orleans--&gt; supervised the building's construction, which was undertaken by [[Benjamin F. Fox]], the master carpenter and joiner, and [[John Mitchell (mason)|John Mitchell]], the master [[stonemasonry|stonemason]] and builder.&lt;ref&gt;Plaque on the façade of the Old U.S. Branch Mint, New Orleans. Accessed June 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the north [[facade|façade]] the mint building features a central projecting [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[portico]], supported by four monumental columns that are flanked at the ends by square [[column|pillars]]. The top of the portico contains a simple [[entablature]], crowned by a flat roof in front of a simple, unadorned [[pediment]]. This entrance, which sits on top of a basement story, fronts the rectangular central core of the facility and is flanked by two large wings of multiple [[bay (architecture)|bays]] of rectangular windows. These wings wrap around the central rectangular core to form a "W"-shaped structure with two square [[courtyard]]s at the rear. [[Balcony|Balconies]] framed by [[wrought iron|iron railings]] and posts adorn the sections of the building's south façade that adjoin the courtyards. Architectural historian [[Talbot Hamlin]] described it thus: "it has those graceful, original proportions so characteristic of Strickland's work. Even today [1944], condemned to a use so different from that for which it was designed, it remains one of the most distinguished of the earlier buildings of New Orleans."&lt;ref&gt;Talbot Hamlin, ''Greek Revival Architecture in America'', 1st ed. OUP 1944, p58 Dover ed. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the interior, Strickland placed the grand staircase that connects the three levels immediately behind the portico in the central core of the structure. The floor system is composed of fired-clay jack arches supported on steel I-beams, a common feature of warehouses and other long-span structures. On the second floor, many of the larger rooms, which were used for coining and melting, contain ceilings with beautiful high arches supported by the walls and freestanding [[pier (architecture)|piers]]. The smaller rectangular rooms on the second level (and the basement), such as the former [[Management|superintendent's]] office, also contain these arched ceilings with a single [[groin vault]]. The basement formerly contained the [[boiler]]s inside a brick cage, but now contain museum exhibits devoted to the minting processes as well as the Coin Vault at the Mint, a coin shop.

===== Structural problems and repairs =====
Strickland did not take into account the swampy lowland and high [[water table]] that characterizes the terrain around New Orleans, and so during its career the New Orleans Mint building has encountered numerous structural problems from the shifting soil beneath its [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) [[P. G. T. Beauregard|Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard]] to fireproof the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling and install [[masonry]] flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain [[Johnson K. Duncan]] by 1859. During this period, the Mint's heavy machinery was converted to [[steam engine|steam power]] so a [[flue gas stack|smokestack]] (since demolished) was built at the rear of the structure to carry away the fumes.&lt;ref&gt;Museum exhibit placard, Old U.S. Branch Mint, New Orleans. Accessed June 22, 2005. Also see Lambousy, 41–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than two years later, Beauregard would rise to national fame as the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Ranks and insignia of the Confederate States|general]] who ordered the April 1861 assault on [[Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor, [[South Carolina]], thus beginning the [[American Civil War]]. It was during the war that Beauregard would secure his place in American history as one of the Confederacy's most capable generals.

==== Early coining operations ====
[[Image:CoinScaleNOMint.JPG|thumb|right|280px|A scale for weighing coinage used at the New Orleans Mint in the 19th century]]
Like any other mint the New Orleans Mint was a factory to make coins. Operations at the New Orleans Mint began on March 8, 1838, with the [[deposit account|deposit]] of the first Mexican gold [[precious metal|bullion]]. The first coins, 30 [[dime (United States coin)|dimes]], were struck on May 7. Until it was taken over by the Confederacy in 1861 it produced many different denominations, all of which were either silver or gold: silver [[three-cent piece (United States coin)|three-cent pieces]] (1851 only), [[half dime]]s, dimes, [[quarter (United States coin)|quarters]], [[half dollar (United States coin)|half dollars]], [[dollar (United States coin)|silver dollars]], [[gold dollar]]s, $2.50 [[Quarter Eagle|quarter eagles]], [[three-dollar piece]]s, $5 [[half-eagle]]s, $10 [[eagle (United States coin)|eagles]], and $20 [[Double Eagle|double eagles]].&lt;ref&gt;Cents and copper-nickel five-cent pieces were never struck at the New Orleans mint. Below is a listing of the coinage produced by the New Orleans Mint, gathered from www.coinfacts.com. Also see Lambousy, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many interesting characters served at the Mint during the early years of operation. One was [[John Leonard Riddell]], who served as melter and [[refining|refiner]] at the Mint from 1839 to 1848, and, outside of his job, pursued interests in botany, medicine, chemistry, geology, and physics. He invented the binocular [[optical microscope|microscope]]. He also wrote on [[numismatics]], publishing in 1845 a book entitled ''Monograph of the Silver Dollar, Good and Bad, Illustrated With Facsimile Figures'', and two years later an article by him appeared in ''[[DeBow's Review]]'' called "The Mint at New Orleans—Processes Pursued of Working the Precious Metals—Statistics of Coinage, etc." Riddell was not held in high esteem by everyone, however: his conflicts with other Mint employees were well-documented, and at one point he was accused of being unable to properly conduct a gold melt.&lt;ref&gt;Museum exhibit placard, Old U.S. Branch Mint, New Orleans, accessed June 22, 2005. Also see Lambousy, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th century the New Orleans Mint was frequently featured in magazines, newspapers and other print publications. Articles discussing and images picturing the Mint, in addition to the one by Riddell noted above, were featured in ''[[Ballou's Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion]]'', published in [[Boston]], and the widely circulated ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Museum exhibit placard, Old U.S. Branch Mint, New Orleans, accessed June 22, 2005. Also see Lambousy, 36–7, for a reprint of the ''Ballou's Pictorial Drawing Room Companion'' illustration.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil War and recommissioning, 1861–79 ===

==== Secession and Confederate seizure ====
[[Image:1861 Confederate Half.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Confederate States of America dollar#Coinage|Confederate half-dollar]] struck at New Orleans in 1861]] 
The New Orleans Mint operated continuously from 1838 until January 26, 1861, when Louisiana [[Ordinance of Secession|seceded]] from the United States. On January 29, the Secession Convention reconvened at New Orleans (it had earlier met in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]) and passed an ordinance that allowed Federal employees to remain in their posts, but as employees of the state of Louisiana. On February 5, 1861, during the proceedings of the Convention of the State of Louisiana in New Orleans, the committee appointed by the Convention to take an inventory on February 1, 1861, of public property in the hands of the officers of 'the late' Federal government reported that the Sub-Treasurer's vault at the mint contained $483,983 in gold and silver coins. The National Archives records in Rockville, Maryland, indicate the $483,983 consisted of $308,771 in gold coins and $175,212.08 in silver coins. The only gold coin produced in January, 1861 was the $20 gold double-eagle. This means 15,438 $20 gold coins were minted by the New Orleans Mint during January, 1861.  Mint coinage records for the $20 1861-O gold double-eagle indicate only 5,000 $20 gold pieces were minted by the Federal Government in January, 1861. This discrepancy is explained in a Numismatist Journal article.&lt;ref&gt;The Numismatist Journal, April 2013, p. 53 and 54: A Mystery Solved NEW ORLEANS MINT 1861 COINAGE RECORDS.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1861, Louisiana accepted the [[Confederate States Constitution]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government retained all the mint officers.&lt;ref&gt;Lambousy, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They used it briefly as their own coinage facility. The Confederates struck 962,633 of the 2,532,633 New Orleans half-dollar coins dated 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Yeoman, 191&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that 1861-O half dollars bearing a bisected date die crack ("WB-103") and 1861-O half-dollars with a "speared olive bud" anomaly ("WB-104") on the reverse had been minted under authority of the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Chapter 6, 1861-O&lt;/ref&gt;  Confederate officials designed alternate reverse [[die (manufacturing)|dies]] which they used to strike [[Confederate States of America dollar#Coinage|their own half-dollars]] in New Orleans (see image). The exact number of the half-dollar coins struck by the Confederate mint with the alternate reverse is unknown; but only four are known to exist today. One of them, which was sold at auction for a large sum, had once been owned by [[Jefferson Davis]], the only [[President of the Confederate States of America|President of the C.S.A.]]

Confederate minting operations continued from April 1 until the [[Gold bullion|bullion]] ran out later that month. The staff remained on duty until May 31, 1861.&lt;ref name="Lambousy, 42–3."&gt;Lambousy, 42–3.&lt;/ref&gt; After that the mint was used for quartering [[Confederate States Army|Confederate troops]], until it was [[Capture of New Orleans|recaptured]] along with the rest of the city the following year, largely by [[Union Navy|Union naval forces]] under the command of Admiral [[David Farragut]].

==== Occupation by Union forces ====
[[Image:NO Min Flag.jpg|thumb|250px|A piece of the U.S. flag William Mumford tore down from the New Orleans Mint in 1862]] 
For many Southern sympathizers, the Mint soon became a symbol of their hatred for the Union occupation. After [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] under Farragut had raised the U.S. flag on the roof of the Mint in April 1862, a professional steamboat gambler named [[William Bruce Mumford]] ascended the roof and tore the flag down. He ripped the banner into shreds, and defiantly stuffed pieces of it into his shirt to wear as souvenirs. Union General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]], the military governor of New Orleans (who was soon to be derisively nicknamed "Spoons" for allegedly pocketing the silverware of New Orleans citizens arrested for treason against the United States), ordered Mumford executed in retaliation. And so, Mumford was hanged from a flagstaff projecting horizontally from the building on June 7, 1862. Mumford's hanging made national headlines. Jefferson Davis demanded that Butler immediately be executed if captured.&lt;ref name="Lambousy, 42–3."/&gt; The event stuck in the minds of many New Orleanians: eleven years later, in 1873, a visitor to the city named Edward King mentioned it in his description of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Museum exhibit placard, Old U.S. Branch Mint, New Orleans. Accessed June 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mint reopened as an [[assay office]] in 1876. Its machinery was evidently damaged during the war, but because of its importance, unlike the mints at Charlotte and Dahlonega, in 1877 U.S. Mint agent James R. Snowden asked the superintendent of the office, Dr. M. F. Bonzano, to report on the condition of the facility for minting. Upon receipt of Bonzano's report, new minting equipment was shipped to New Orleans. The building was refurbished and put back into active minting service in 1879, producing mainly silver coinage, including the famed [[Morgan Dollar|Morgan silver dollar]] from 1879 to 1904.&lt;ref name="Lambousy, 43."&gt;Lambousy, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A second chance, 1879–1909 ===

==== New Orleans coinage ====
[[Image:1899O.jpg|thumb|270px|An 1899-O [[Morgan dollar]]. Some of the most famous American coins, today they are the most widely available of the types produced in New Orleans.]] 
The refurbishment and recommissioning of the New Orleans Mint was due partly to the fact that in 1878 the Federal government in Washington, D.C. had passed the [[Bland–Allison Act]], which mandated the purchase and coining of a large quantity of silver yearly. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] needed additional facilities to do so. It reopened the New Orleans facility primarily to coin large quantities of silver dollars, most of which were simply stored in the building instead of circulated.&lt;ref&gt;See David Lange, ''A History of the United States Mint and its Coinage'' (Atlanta: Whitman Publishing, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] appointed former [[Mississippi]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] and governor [[Henry S. Foote]] the new superintendent of the mint.

During this second period of operation, the Mint also struck dimes, quarters, half dollars, $5 half eagles, $10 eagles and, in 1879 only, 2,325 double eagles. It should also be noted that the New Orleans Mint was used by the Federal authorities in 1907 to coin over five and a half million silver [[Mexican peso#History|twenty-centavo]] pieces for the Mexican government as part of the American government's program of producing foreign coinage. The New Orleans Mint, whose coins can be identified by the "O" [[mint mark]] found on the [[obverse and reverse|reverse]] of its coinage, earned a reputation for producing coins of a mediocre quality; their luster is usually not as brilliant as those of other mints, and center areas tend to be flattened and not sharply struck. Thus, well-struck New Orleanian coinage is prized in the numismatic world today.&lt;ref&gt;Q. David Bowers, ''The Official Red Book of Morgan Silver Dollars: A Complete History and Price Guide.'' (Atlanta: Whitman Publishing, 2004), 11, 42, 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social history ====
[[Image:NO Mint WaterCooler.jpg|frame|A water cooler given as a gift to the head of the coining department at the New Orleans Mint in 1891 by his staff]] Men made up the majority of the workers at the mint. They worked such jobs as coiners, melters, pressers, cutters, and rollers. The mint was overseen by a superintendent, who was always male. He was a political appointee whose term usually did not last much longer than the [[List of political parties in the United States|party]] which held the presidency remained in power.

But it was also during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint employed forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin [[planchet]]s to make sure they were the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.

The women worked from 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working conditions were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost attention to the [[weighing scale|scales']] balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief from the heat and avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The information for this entire section has been gleaned from various museum exhibit placards at the Old U.S. Branch Mint, New Orleans. Accessed June 22, 2005. Also see ''The Old U.S. Mint: A Historic Property of the Louisiana State Museum.'' Brochure. New Orleans: Louisiana State Museum, c. 2005. n.p. (third page).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The mint in the 20th &amp; 21st centuries ===

==== Closure ====
[[Image:OMINTMARK.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the "O" mint mark on a New Orleans $10 gold piece]]
By the early twentieth century, the U.S. Treasury had mints operating in New Orleans, [[Denver Mint|Denver]], [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], and the main center in Philadelphia, which more than met the demand for minted money. In 1904, the government ceased the minting of the silver dollar, which accounted for the bulk of the coinage the New Orleans branch had been producing since 1879. In 1909 Treasury officials declined to appropriate funds for the mint's operation, effectively halting subsequent minting activity in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, ''A History of the United States Mint and Its Coinage''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, the New Orleans Mint was formally decommissioned and the machinery was transferred to the main U. S. Mint facility in Philadelphia,.&lt;ref name="Lambousy, 43."/&gt;

Twenty years later, in [[United States Senate elections, 1930|1930]], [[List of Governors of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Huey Long]] would rail against this loss when he ran for the office of U.S. Senator against incumbent [[Joseph E. Ransdell]]. In a circular distributed by his campaign to the citizens of New Orleans, Long listed the loss of the Mint as the very first of many complaints against Ransdell's lengthy service record in the Senate. Long went on to win the election, although he did not take office until his term as governor expired in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;See T. Harry Williams, ''Huey Long'' (New York: Knopf, 1969; first Vintage edition, 1981), 466; for full details of Long's election campaign, see pp. 460–80.&lt;/ref&gt; At some point, however, the original New Orleans machinery was lost, and, at present, has not been located.&lt;ref&gt;''The Old U.S. Mint: A Historic Property of the Louisiana State Museum.'' Brochure. New Orleans: Louisiana State Museum, c. 2005. n.p. (third page).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Transformation ====
[[Image:New Orleans Mint Basement.JPG|thumb|250px|The basement of the old U.S. Mint contains artifacts and photographs from the era 1838–1909, and is the part of the museum devoted exclusively to the building's function in that capacity.]]
After the mint closed, it performed a variety of functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury as it had been from 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|Federal prison]], in which capacity it served until 1943. The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the state of Louisiana in 1965. During the [[Cold War]], when many believed there to be a high risk of nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best [[fallout shelter]] in the city.

The state agreed to save the structure from demolition on the condition that it be renovated and converted to some new purpose within fifteen years. Between 1978 and 1980 this goal was met. Since 1981, the Mint building has functioned as a museum of its coin production history. Additional exhibitions housed in the facility have been devoted to [[New Orleans Mardi Gras]] (since moved to [[the Presbytere]] building on [[Jackson Square (New Orleans)|Jackson Square]]), [[jazz]] music (a large exhibit and research materials previously in the [[New Orleans Jazz Museum]] &amp;ndash; donated by the N.O. Jazz Club), and [[Newcomb Pottery]].  All three phenomena have contributed to New Orleans' fame.

On the third floor, the Mint houses an archive of maps and documents, including French and Spanish colonial records. Along with [[the Cabildo]], the Presbytere, the [[1850 House]], and [[Madame John's Legacy]], this facility is one of five branches of the [[Louisiana State Museum]] in the [[French Quarter]].&lt;ref name="lsm.crt.state.la.us"&gt;See {{cite web
 | title = Louisiana State Museum: Old U.S. Mint 
 | url=http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/mintex.htm
 | accessdate = 2006-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Mint building is located at 400 [[Esplanade Avenue, New Orleans|Esplanade Avenue]], not far from the [[Mississippi River]].

==== Katrina aftermath ====
{{main article|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans}}
The mint building suffered significant roof damage from the hurricane. Water entered the building and came into contact with approximately 3% of the New Orleans Jazz collection, portions of which were removed and cared for at [[Louisiana State University]], the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]], and the [[Louisiana State Archive and Research Library|Louisiana State Archives]].

|The two years that this coin was minted in New Orleans marked the first time in American numismatic history that mint marks appeared on the obverse. After 1840, mint marks would generally be found on the reverse, with the exception of the Lincoln Cents beginning in 1909, until 1968.  Coins dated 1838 are exceedingly rare.  Coins dated 1839 are somewhat more accessible.

Coins minted on January 25 of 1861 would be the last silver coins minted by the US Government in New Orleans until 1879.  Coins minted on the 26th were silver coins minted by the State of Louisiana.  Thus, the Seated Liberty Half Dollar would be the last US silver coin minted here until 1879.

==Taxonomy==
''Penaeus monodon'' was [[alpha taxonomy|first described]] by [[Johan Christian Fabricius]] in 1798. That name was overlooked for a long time, however, until 1949, when [[Lipke Holthuis]] clarified to which species it referred.&lt;ref name="Holthuis"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Lipke Holthuis|L. B. Holthuis]] |year=1949 |title=The identity of ''Penaeus monodon'' Fabr. |journal=Proceedings of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen |volume=52 |issue=9 |pages=1051–1057 |url=http://decapoda.nhm.org/pdfs/25756/25756.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holthuis also showed that ''P.&amp;nbsp;monodon'' had to be the [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Penaeus]]''.&lt;ref name="Holthuis"/&gt;

==Description==
Females can reach about {{convert|33|cm|abbr=on}} long, but are typically {{convert|25|-|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} long and weight {{convert|200|-|320|g|0|abbr=on}}; males are slightly smaller at {{convert|20|-|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} long and weighing {{convert|100|-|170|g|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; The carapace and abdomen are transversely banded with alternative red and white. The antennae are grayish brown. Brown pereiopods and pleopods are present with fringing setae in red.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/10862/860|title = Studies on the fisheries biology of the giant tiger prawn, ''Penaeus monodon'' in the Philippines |last = Motoh, H|year=1981| publisher= Aquaculture Department, Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center |issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Its natural distribution is the [[Indo-Pacific]], ranging from the eastern coast of [[Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], as far as [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Pacific Ocean]], and northern [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="SPW"&gt;{{cite book |series=FAO Species Catalogue |volume=1 |title=Shrimps and Prawns of the World.

It is an [[invasive species]] in the northern waters of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]&lt;ref name="Chron-Invasive"/&gt; and the Atlantic Ocean off the southern US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisheries|first1=NOAA|title=Invasion of Asian Tiger Shrimp in Southeast U.S. Waters :: NOAA Fisheries|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/stories/2014/07/7_21_14asian_tiger_shrimp.html|website=www.nmfs.noaa.gov|accessdate=3 October 2016|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aquaculture==
''Penaeus monodon'' is the second-most widely cultured prawn species in the world, after only [[whiteleg shrimp]], ''Litopenaeus vannamei''.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; In 2009, 770,000 [[tonne]]s were produced, with a total value of [[United States dollar|US$]]3,650,000,000.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

== Sustainable consumption ==
In 2010, [[Greenpeace]] added ''Penaeus monodon'' to its seafood red list – "a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries".&lt;ref name="redlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species/ |title=Greenpeace International Seafood Red list |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |accessdate=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons given by Greenpeace were "destruction of vast areas of mangroves in several countries, over-fishing of juvenile shrimp from the wild to supply farms, and significant human rights abuses".&lt;ref name="redlist"/&gt;

'''The Poetry Archive''' is a free, web-based library formed to hold recordings of English language poets reading their own work. It was founded by recording producer Richard Carrington and poet [[Andrew Motion]], during his appointment as UK Poet Laureate in 1999.&lt;ref Name=launch&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7616226.stm|title=US voices added to poetry archive  |publisher=BBC News |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4524646.stm|title=Motion cheers online poem archive  |publisher=BBC News |date= 14 December 2005 |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recordings of contemporary work began in 2000 and the site went live in 2005.  The Poetry Archive is a not-for-profit registered UK charity.&lt;ref Name=Official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/aboutus.do |title=About us|publisher=Poetry Archive |date= |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and development==
The archive was established as a web-based library to ensure that the oral record of modern poets is not lost, as it has been with writers such as [[Thomas Hardy]], [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[A. E. Housman]] whose voices were never recorded, despite the technology being available at the time.&lt;ref Name=Official/&gt; The resource is built on the idea that poets have a unique relationship with their own work and are often able to communicate the nuance, musicality and subtlety of it, with a deeper understanding than actors.&lt;ref Name=Official/&gt; Texts to the poems and other resources are available but the poet's voice is the main concern of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sprackland|first=Jean|title="The Poetry Archive"|journal=NATE Classroom|publisher=NATE ([[National Association for the Teaching of English]])|volume=4|issue=Spring 2008|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motion has stated "To hear the speed at which a poet reads, to hear their accent, to hear how they inflect their voice, to hear how they create a space around their words - or don't - all add to our using of what the meaning of poem might be."&lt;ref Name=launch/&gt; Contemporary studio recordings for the project began in 2000, shortly after Motion was appointed a Poet Laureate, and the site went live in 2005.&lt;ref Name="Classic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4482824.stm|title=Classic poets' voices go online|date=30 November 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the recordings are created especially for the organisation, however some historic readings are archived. Poets are chosen by a selection panel, chaired by Andrew Motion and works added to the site every month. CDs of archive works are available. Launched in 2014, there is also a download store which allows people to purchase and download audio poetry directly from the website.&lt;ref Name=Official/&gt;

In the first year, the site had 500,000 visitors, building to over 1.5 million annual users in 2008, nearly 2 million in 2009 and over 3 million in 2012.&lt;ref Name="Voices"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Laurels"/&gt;&lt;ref Name=Life&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/05/andrew-motion-life-in-writing|title=Andrew Motion: a life in writing|date=5 October 2012|work=Guardian|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive forms part of the permanent legacy of Motion's time as Poet Laureate. He states that he would never have been able to raise the £2000000 needed to launch the library without his position.&lt;ref Name="Laurels"/&gt;&lt;ref Name=Life/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kc071|title=A Laureate's Legacy - The Poetry Archive|date=25 Dec 2009|publisher=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was initially funded by the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], government grants and private donors in conjunction with work by [[Jean Sprackland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Poetry+Archive+puts+recordings+online.-a0139312941|title=Poetry Archive puts recordings online.|date=30 November  2005|publisher=Telecomworldwire|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current president is Sir [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]. The previous president was the late poet [[Seamus Heaney]] and the project is supported by patrons [[Billy Collins]] and [[Melvyn Bragg]].&lt;ref Name=Official/&gt;

==Content==
 
As of September 2015, the readings of over 400 poets are available on the site, with content searchable by title, author, theme, and form. Historic recordings available on the archive include [[Alfred Tennyson]] (recorded by [[Thomas Edison]] 1890), [[Robert Browning]] (1889), [[Rudyard Kipling]] (1921) [[W. B. Yeats]] (1932) and [[Langston Hughes]] (1955).&lt;ref name="Poets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/poetsHome.do|title=Poets|publisher=Poetry Archive|accessdate=9 April 2013|archivedate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary writers include [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Billy Collins]], [[Carol Ann Duffy]] and [[John Ashbery]].&lt;ref Name=launch/&gt;&lt;ref name="Poets"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=91|title=John Ashbery|publisher=Poetry Archive|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=11468|title=Carol Ann Duffy|publisher=Poetry Archive|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of New Zealand [[Allen Curnow]] was recorded shortly before his death in 2001, one of the first to be archived. Cornish poet [[Charles Causley]] gave a reading aged 86, in the year before he died in 2003.&lt;ref Name="Classic"/&gt; Motion commented:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
::It's a fantastically powerful recording that was done a matter of days before his death. It doesn't show on the recording, but Richard, who made the recording, said that between each poem Charles broke down and wept, and had to gather himself. He knew that he was dying. He was saying goodbye to each of his poems. If you only listen to one of the poems on the website, listen to "Eden Rock". It's a great poem and he reads it so beautifully and introduces it so touchingly.&lt;ref name="Scotsman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/books/features/well-versed-in-web-power-1-486253|title=Well versed in web power|date=16 March 2006|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=122|title=Charles Causley|publisher=Poetry Archive|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006 historic readings by [[Dylan Thomas]], [[Ted Hughes]] and [[Walter de la Mare]], were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6156929.stm|title=Poem archive adds historic voices|date=30 November 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the project worked with the BBC to archive rare readings by [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[Robert Graves]] and [[Philip Larkin]].&lt;ref Name="Voices"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/30/news.sarahcrown|title=Poetry Archive unveils lost voices|date=30 November 2006|work=Guardian|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 over 60 American recordings were archived on the site, in collaboration with the [[Poetry Foundation]], based in Chicago. Readers include [[Ted Kooser]], [[Robert Pinsky]], and [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]]. &lt;ref Name=launch/&gt; The main archive site also includes children's poetry, with a separate website being developed www.childrenspoetryarchive.org dedicated solely to presenting children's poetry, with work by poets such as [[Roald Dahl]], [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Michael Rosen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenspoetryarchive.org|title=Children's archive|publisher=Poetry Archive|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19700|title=Poetry Archive|publisher=Academy of American Poets|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website also now features collections of classic poetry being read by contemporary poets and some famous voices, including [[Helen Mirren]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Judi Dench]] and [[Alan Rickman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/explore/browse-poets?f[0]=type%3Apoet&amp;f[1]=field_archive_collections%3A13|title=Classic Poems|date=10 November 2014|work=The Poetry Archive|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archive also includes extensive material for teachers and students, including glossaries, biographies and lesson plans that integrated as a school resource.&lt;ref Name="Laurels"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/21/andrew-motion-poet-laureate|title=Yet once more, O ye laurels|date=21 March 2009|work=Guardian|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=Julie|date=February 2009|title=Using the Poetry Archive in the English Classroom|journal=English Drama Media|issue=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lockney|first=Karen|date=Fall 2012|title=The Poetry Archive in the Classroom|journal=NATE Classroom|publisher=NATE|issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, independent activist [[Phantom Bill Stickers]] pasted poems up in public spaces in New Zealand cities, featuring bar codes that could be scanned by smart phones. The code linked to the writers reading their poem on the Poetry Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10832595|title=Sharing the deep emotion|date=8 September 2012|work=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Primary Atomic Reference Clock in Space''' or '''PARCS''' was an [[atomic clock|atomic-clock]] mission scheduled to fly on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2008, but cancelled to make way for the [[Vision for Space Exploration]].&lt;ref name="bremen"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zarm.uni-bremen.de/2forschung/gravi/laemmerzahl/LaserRanging2005/speakers.htm |title=Lasers, Clocks, and Drag-Free technologies for Future Exploration in Space and Tests of Gravity: Speakers, Titles, Abstracts, References |accessdate=2008-01-17 |publisher=359th WE-Heraeus Seminar |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613082852/http://www.zarm.uni-bremen.de/2forschung/gravi/laemmerzahl/LaserRanging2005/speakers.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission, to have been funded by [[NASA]], involved a laser-cooled [[caesium]] atomic clock, and a time-transfer system using [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) satellites. PARCS was to fly concurrently with the [[Superconducting Microwave Oscillator]] (SUMO)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ips.gov.au/IPSHosted/NCRS/wars/wars2002/proceedings/invited/print/tobar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a different type of clock that was to be compared against the PARCS clock to test certain theories. The objectives of the mission were to have been:

*Test [[Gravitation|gravitational theory]]
*Study laser-cooled [[atom]]s in [[microgravity]]
*Improve the accuracy of [[time]]keeping on earth

==Experiment location==
The proposed ISS location for the experiment was on the External Facility of the [[Japanese Experimental Module]] (JEM). This location afforded good views of the GPS constellation of [[satellite]]s, needed for comparing space and ground clocks. In addition, the volume, available power, and coolant system were well matched to the mission requirements.

==Goals==
The microgravity environment of space allows slowing of atoms to speeds well below those used in terrestrial atomic clocks, providing for substantial improvement in clock accuracy. This very accurate space clock will be compared continuously to the SUMO oscillator, and these two clocks (being fundamentally different) will provide a test of "[[local position invariance]]." Comparisons between the space and earth clocks will yield a related, but important measurement of the gravitational frequency shift. Finally, the signals conveyed to the ground through the GPS time-transfer system will serve as a truly international time standard available to anyone on earth.

==Institutions and people==
PARCS is a cooperative effort between the following organizations:

*[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), which contributed Flight Hardware Development
*[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), which contributed  Concept/Development Testing
*[[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], which contributed  Gravitational Testing

==Staff==
Bill Klipstein of JPL was the Project Scientist, and Dave Seidel of JPL was the Project Manager. The Co-Principal Investigators were Don Sullivan and Bill Phillips of NIST, and Neil Ashby of the University of Colorado. John Lipa of Stanford University was the Principal Investigator for SUMO and John Dick of JPL serves was the Project Scientist for that program.

 }}'''Proofpoint''' is an enterprise security company based in [[Sunnyvale, California]] that provides [[software as a service]] and products for inbound [[Email security#Privacy concerns|email security]], outbound [[data loss prevention]], [[social media]], [[mobile device]]s, [[Digital media|digital risk]], [[email encryption]], [[electronic discovery]] ("eDiscovery”), and [[email archiving]]. It claims over half of the Fortune 100 as users of its solutions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.proofpoint.com/us/company/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Founding===
The company was founded in June 2002 by [[Eric Hahn]], formerly the CTO of [[Netscape|Netscape Communications]]. It launched July 21, 2003, after raising a $7 million [[Series A funding]] round, releasing its first product, and lining up six customers as references, and was backed by venture investors [[Benchmark Capital]] and [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="sanjose.bizjournals.com"&gt;[http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2003/07/21/story4.html?t=printable Proofpoint joins anti-spam crowd, San Jose Business Journal, Jul 18, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional $9 million in Series B funding led by New York-based RRE Ventures was announced in October, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2003/10/13/daily16.html Proofpoint adds funding, San Jose Business Journal, Oct 14, 2003].&lt;/ref&gt;

Proofpoint became a publicly traded company in April 2012. At the time of its [[initial public offering]] (IPO), the company's shares traded at $13 apiece; investors purchased more than 6.3 million shares through the IPO, raising more than $80 million.&lt;ref name="DealBook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/proofpoint-and-infoblox-rise-on-debuts/ |work=The New York Times |date=April 20, 2012 |title=Proofpoint and Infoblox Rise on Debuts |accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product History===
The company's first product was the Proofpoint Protection Server for medium and large businesses.  It incorporated what was described as "MLX Technology", proprietary [[machine learning]] algorithms applied to the problem of accurately identifying [[Email spam|spam email]] using 10,000 different attributes to differentiate between spam and valid email. The company joined dozens of other anti-spam software providers&lt;ref name="sanjose.bizjournals.com"/&gt; in a business opportunity fueled by an exponential increase in [[Email spam|spam]] volume that was threatening worker productivity, making spam a top business priority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=17100348 Fighting Spam, Fueling Growth, InformationWeek Research's Outlook 2004 Survey].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2004 National Technology Readinesed the number of spam detection attributes to more than 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2003/1103proofpoint.html Proofpoint improves spam prevention, Nov 3, 2003, NetworkWorld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531031643/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2003/1103proofpoint.html |date=2008-05-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Encryption products spurred by HIPAA====
In 2004, strict new regulations governing financial disclosures and the privacy of health care data prompted Proofpoint to begin developing new products that would automatically identify and intercept outbound email containing sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/13498/ Email Inspector, MIT Technology Review, Mar 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2004, Proofpoint introduced its first hardware appliance, the P-Series Message Protection Appliance (later renamed Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway), using a hardened Linux kernel and Proofpoint's Protection Server 2.0 software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2004/0315proofpoint.html IronPort, Proofpoint appliances target spam, NetworkWorld, March 15, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531031649/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2004/0315proofpoint.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was tested by Infoworld and found to stop 94% of spam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/05/28/22TCspam_1.html BorderWare and Proofpoint boxes are both capable spam combatants, Infoworld, May 28, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616170257/http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/05/28/22TCspam_1.html |date=June 16, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another product introduction in November, 2004 included Protection Server 3.0, with Email Firewall and MLX-based Dynamic Reputation Analysis, and the Content Security Suite, plug-in modules designed for scanning outbound messages and their attachments to assist in compliance with data protection regulations such as [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], [[HIPAA]], and [[Gramm-leach-bliley|Gramm-Leach-Bliley]]. In combination, this was known as the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Appliance. It was reviewed by ChannelWeb [https://web.archive.org/web/20080605213325/http://www.crn.com/it-channel/54200259 ProofPoint Appliance Stands Guard At E-Mail Gate, ChannelWeb, Nov 26, 2004], which observed that it used a "combination of technologies: [[policy-based management]], a spam-filtering engine and adaptive learning technology".

Proofpoint introduced a new product, the Network Content Sentry, as an add-on appliance to the Content Security Suite in August, 2005.&lt;ref name="eweek.com"&gt;[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Proofpoint-Voltage-Team-on-EMail-Encryption/ Proofpoint, Voltage Team on E-Mail Encryption, eweek.com, August 1, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; Designed to monitor online messaging other than email, the appliance monitors Web mail, message boards, blogs and FTP-based communications. Proofpoint also introduced policy-based [[email encryption]] features, using identity-based encryption technology licensed from Voltage Security.

====[[Virtual appliance]] development====
In a step towards simpler operational requirements, the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Virtual Edition was released in April 2007. The product runs as a [[Virtual machine|virtual appliance]] on a host running VMware's virtual server software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crn.com/security/199100674 CRN Test Center Review: A Virtual Solution To Spam, ChannelWeb, Apr 23, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607024928/http://www.crn.com/security/199100674 |date=2008-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moving a dedicated hardware appliance to a virtual server eliminates problems associated with proprietary hardware and reduces upgrade costs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/042607-appliance-overload.html When appliances get out of hand, NetworkWorld, Apr 4, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614225048/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/042607-appliance-overload.html |date=2008-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it does require knowledge of VMware's [[VMware|virtual server architecture]].

Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway V5.0 was released in June 2007, and was based on a new, integrated architecture, combining all its capabilities into a single platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byteandswitch.com/document.asp?doc_id=125517 Proofpoint Intros Proofpoint 5, ByteandSwitch, Jun 4, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; It could be run either as a dedicated appliance, virtual appliance, or software suite.

ICSA Labs, an independent division of [[Verizon Business]], announced in April 2007, that it had certified six anti-spam products under their new testing program, one of which was the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway. The goal of ICSA Labs' anti-spam product testing and certification is to evaluate product effectiveness in detecting and removing spam. The guidelines also address how well the products recognize e-mail messages from legitimate sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/icsa-labs-introduces-formal-testing-of-anti-spam-products,345941.shtml Earth Times, Apr 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Software as a Service====
Moving into the [[Software as a service|software-as-a-service]] business, Proofpoint introduced Proofpoint on Demand, a hosted version of its email security and data loss prevention offerings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/080707-proofpoint-managed-security-service.html Proofpoint jumps into security services fray, NetworkWorld, Aug 7, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612232234/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/080707-proofpoint-managed-security-service.html |date=2008-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, 2008, the company’s hosted offerings were expanded with the introduction of Proofpoint on Demand—Standard Edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebizq.net/news/9561.html Proofpoint Offers On Demand Email Security for SMBs, ebiz, May 12, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The product is targeted at small-to-medium size businesses that need email security but do not run their own servers or have on-site IT personnel.

== Products  ==
Proofpoint products are designed to solve three business problems: advanced [[cybersecurity]] threats, regulatory [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]], and brand-impostor fraud (which it calls “digital risk”). These products work across [[email]], [[social media]], [[mobile device]]s, and the [[Cloud computing|cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Proofpoint-Enterprise-Protection-Product-overview|title=Proofpoint Enterprise Protection: Product overview|work=SearchSecurity|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Proofpoint-Email-Encryption-Product-overview|title=Proofpoint Email Encryption: Product overview|work=SearchSecurity|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.complianceweek.com/blogs/grc-announcements/proofpoint-releases-proofpoint-intelligent-supervision#.WNWKsRLytE7|title=Proofpoint releases Proofpoint Intelligent Supervision {{!}} Compliance Week|website=www.complianceweek.com|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Email Security ===

In June 2008, Proofpoint acquired [[Fortiva]], Inc., a provider of on-demand [[Email archiving]] software for legal discovery, regulatory compliance and email storage management.&lt;sup&gt;[[Proofpoint, Inc.#cite note-26|[26]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Fortiva used Exchange journaling to automatically archive all internal and external communications so that end users can search all archived messages, including attachments, directly from a search folder in Outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://threatpost.com/fbi-email-scams-take-3-1-billion-toll-on-businesses/118696/|title=FBI: Email Scams Take $3.1 Billion Toll on Businesses|date=2016-06-15|work=Threatpost {{!}} The first stop for security news|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Computer security|Cybersecurity]] ===

Proofpoint’s security portfolio includes products that stop both traditional [[cyberattacks]] (delivered via malicious attachments and URLs) and socially engineered attacks—such as business email compromise (BEC) and credential phishing—that do not use [[malware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/opinion/wiping-out-email-fraud/news-story/c854fde5d09225aebb4ac120dd1e3e1e|title=Wiping out email fraud|date=2016-06-16|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a blend of sandbox analysis, reputational analysis, automated threat data, human threat intelligence and attributes such as sender/recipient relationship, headers, and content, and more to detect potential threats. Automated [[encryption]], data-loss prevention and forensics-gathering tools are designed to speed incident response and mitigate the damage and costs of any threats that do get through. The portfolio also includes protection from social-media account takeovers, harmful [[mobile app]]s, and rogue [[Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi networks]].

=== [[Regulatory compliance|Regulatory Compliance]] ===

Proofpoint’s compliance products are designed to reduce the manual labor involved in identifying potentially sensitive data, managing and supervising it in compliance with government and industry rules, and producing  it quickly in [[e-discovery]] legal requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.proofpoint.com/us/proofpoint-announces-intelligent-supervision-and-compliance-gateway-help-customers-finra-and-sec|title=Proofpoint Announces Intelligent Supervision and Compliance Gateway to Help Customers with FINRA and SEC Audits {{!}} Proofpoint|website=www.proofpoint.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital Risk ===

Proofpoint’s digital risk products are aimed at companies seeking to stop [[Cyber criminals|cybercriminals]] from impersonating their brand to harm customers, partners, and the brand’s reputation. Its email digital risk portfolio includes authentication technology to prevent email domain spoofing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+Digital+Risk+Monitoring+Q3+2016/-/E-RES117536|title=The Forrester Wave™: Digital Risk Monitoring, Q3 2016|website=www.forrester.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On social media, it stops scams in which fraudsters create fake customer-service accounts to find people seeking help over social media and trick them into handing over account credentials or visiting a malicious website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/294811/|title=Social Media Phishing Soars, New Trend Is Fake Customer Service|website=www.mediapost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in mobile, it finds counterfeit apps distributed through mobile app stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/mobile-devices-what-could-go-wrong-a-9718|title=Mobile Devices: What Could Go Wrong?|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 [[Forrester Research|Forrester]] Wave™ for Digital Risk Monitoring, Q3 2016 the Proofpoint digital risk / [[social media]] product was included in an evaluation of the nine top vendors in this emerging market. These solutions monitor “digital”—i.e., [[Social media|social]], [[Mobile phone|mobile]], [[Website|web]], and [[dark web]]—channels to detect, prevent, malicious or unwanted content from undermining organizational efforts to build brand across all major social media platforms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+Digital+Risk+Monitoring+Q3+2016/-/E-RES117536|title=The Forrester Wave™: Digital Risk Monitoring, Q3 2016|website=www.forrester.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Oct 23, 2014 Proofpoint acquired [https://www.scmagazine.com/proofpoint-finalizes-nexgate-acquisition/article/538320/ Nexgate, Inc.] a social media and security compliance vendor.

The '''Prussian Heritage Image Archive''' ({{lang-de|Bildarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz}} or 'bpk') is an agency of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]]. The archive is housed at the [[Otto Nagel]]-Haus in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] and offers photographs, cartoons and drawings in the fields of history, culture and fine arts. The collection also contains the personal estates, archives and portfolios of many famous photographers who documented life in Germany. Organizationally, the archive is a division of the [[Berlin State Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bpkgate.picturemaxx.com/webgate_cms/de/article/33.html?| title=Bildarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz |trans-title=| date= | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-02 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The core of the collection was built in 1966 from the historical picture library of [[Hermann Handke]]. This stock consists of about 1 million [[Daguerreotype|daguerrotypes]], [[Calotype|talbotypes]], [[photographic printing|photographic prints]], [[negative (photography)|negatives]], [[engravings]] and [[lithographs]]. Through targeted acquisitions, donations and estate gifts, bpk's collection has grown to over 12 million photographs today and is one of the largest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bpkgate.picturemaxx.com/webgate_cms/en/article/33.html?nav=s&amp;nav_s=b&amp;thema=102| title=BPK Archive History |trans-title=| date= | publisher= | accessdate=2012-02-02 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Collection ==
Photographs documenting contemporary German history form the vast majority of the collection. Photographs of works of fine arts and culture from famous museums around the world are the second main focus.

=== German historical Photography ===
The earliest part of the collection starts with photographs from the period of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918). During the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933), [[Photojournalism|press photography]] is particularly well represented. The period of the [[Third Reich]] and [[World War II]] (1933–1945) is widely documented by many photographers, some of whom also went on to document early [[Allied-occupied Germany|postwar Germany]] (1945–49). Current events in the later years of [[West Germany]] is extensively well represented, as well as photographs of everyday life in the communist-ruled [[German Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bpkgate.picturemaxx.com/webgate_cms/en/article/33.html?nav=s&amp;nav_s=b&amp;thema=102| title=BPK Photo Collection History |trans-title=| date= | publisher= | accessdate=2012-02-02 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Otto-Nagel-Haus.jpg|thumbnail|left]]
=== Culture and Fine Arts Photography ===
The core of this collection consists of photographs of [[fine arts]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in the [[Berlin State Museums]], the [[Berlin State Library]] and the other institutions of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]]. The collection has been expanded with digital photographs of artworks from museums outside Berlin, including the [[Bavarian State Picture Collection]],
the [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]], the [[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden]], and the [[Museum der bildenden Künste]] in [[Leipzig]]. '''bpk''' is also the sole distributor in the German language market for photographs of fine arts from the [[Réunion des Musées Nationaux]] in [[Paris]], including the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]], [[Musée d'Orsay]] and [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]]. Since 2005 '''bpk''' has become the sole distributor in Germany, Austria and Switzerland for the Italian picture agency [[Scala Archives]], which contributes photographs of artworks in famous Italian museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bpkgate.picturemaxx.com/webgate_cms/en/article/33.html?nav=s&amp;nav_s=b&amp;thema=102| title=BPK Fine Arts and Culture Collection History |trans-title=| date= | publisher= | accessdate=2012-02-02 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online Collection ===
Through its web portal, '''bpk''' makes available over 300,000 digital images from its collection. With few exceptions the agency holds exclusive copyright to its collection. Therefore the images are not in the [[public domain]] and [[publication rights]] must be obtained from bpk.

[[File:Private_SNAFU.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Private Snafu]]'' was a series of instructional cartoons devised by [[Frank Capra]] and produced by [[Warner Brothers]] animators such as [[Chuck Jones]] for the US Army during WW2.]] 

'''SNAFU''' is an [[acronym]] that is widely used to stand for the sarcastic expression '''Situation Normal: All Fucked Up'''. It is a well-known example of military acronym slang, however the original military acronym stood for "Status Nominal: All Fucked Up." It is sometimes [[Expurgation|bowdlerized]] to "all fouled up" or similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neary|first=Lynn|title=Fifty Years of 'The Cat in the Hat'| publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|quote= 'Situation Normal All . . . All Fouled Up,' as the first SNAFU animated cartoon put it|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7651308|accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It means that the situation is bad, but that this is a normal state of affairs. The acronym is believed to have originated in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during [[World War II]].

In modern usage, ''SNAFU'' is sometimes used as an [[interjection]]. ''SNAFU'' also sometimes refers to a bad situation, mistake, or cause of trouble. It is more commonly used in modern vernacular to describe running into an error or problem that is large and unexpected. For example, in 2005, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article titled "Hospital Staff Cutback Blamed for Test Result Snafu".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/19/nyregion/19pap.html?scp=4&amp;sq=snafu&amp;st=cse "Hospital Staff Cutback Blamed for Test Result Snafu"], in: ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
''SNAFU'' was first recorded in ''[[American Notes and Queries]]'' in their September 1941 issue.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;''A Supplement to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', R. W. Burchfield, ed., Volume IV Se-Z, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine used the term in their June 16, 1942 issue: "Last week U.S. citizens knew that gasoline rationing and rubber requisitioning were snafu."&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt; Most reference works, including the ''[[Random House Unabridged Dictionary]]'', supply an origin date of 1940–1944, generally attributing it to the [[U.&amp;nbsp;S. Army|U.S. Army]]. [[Rick Atkinson]] ascribes the origin of ''SNAFU'', ''[[FUBAR]]'', and a bevy of other terms to cynical [[GI (military)|GIs]] ridiculing the Army's penchant for acronyms.&lt;ref&gt;''The Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943–1944'' (part of ''The Liberation Trilogy'') by [[Rick Atkinson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The attribution of ''SNAFU'' to the American military is not universally accepted: it has also been attributed to the [[United Kingdom|British]],&lt;ref&gt;''Rawson's Dictionary of Euphemisms and Other Doubletalk.'' [[Chicago, IL]] 2002, Hugh Rawson.&lt;/ref&gt; although the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' gives its origin and first recorded use as U.S. military slang.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

In a wider study of military slang, Elkin noted in 1946 that there "are a few acceptable substitutes such as 'screw up' or 'mess up,' but these do not have the emphasis value of the obscene equivalent." He considered the expression to be "a caricature of Army direction. The soldier resignedly accepts his own less responsible position and expresses his cynicism at the inefficiency of Army authority." He also noted that "the expression […] is coming into general civilian use."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last= Elkin| first= Frederick| date=March 1946 |title= The Soldier's Language| journal= American Journal of Sociology| volume= 51| issue= 5 Human Behavior in Military Society| publisher= The University of Chicago Press| pages= 414–422| jstor= 2771105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar acronyms==
===SUSFU===
'''SUSFU''' is an acronym for '''''S'''ituation '''u'''nchanged: '''s'''till '''f'''ucked '''u'''p'', but can also be [[Bowdlerization|bowdlerized]]—just like ''SNAFU''—to '''''S'''ituation '''u'''nchanged: '''s'''till &lt;u&gt;'''f'''ouled&lt;/u&gt; '''u'''p'' or similar. It is used in a [[military]] context, was first recorded in the ''[[American Notes and Queries]]'' in their September 1941 issue.

'''Selah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|l|ə|(|h|)}}; {{lang-he-n|סֶלָה}}, also transliterated as ''selāh'') is a word used 74 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]]—seventy-one times in the [[Psalms]] and three times in the [[Book of Habakkuk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christiantoday.com/article/selah-it-appears-74-times-in-the-bible-but-what-does-it-mean/104172.htm|title=\'Selah\': It Appears 74 Times In The Bible But What Does It Mean?|website=www.christiantoday.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the word is not known, though various interpretations are given below. (It should not be confused with the Hebrew word ''sela`'' ({{lang-he-n|סֶלַע}}) which means "rock", or in an adjectival form, "like a rock", i.e.: firm, hard, heavy) It is probably either a liturgico-musical mark or an instruction on the reading of the text, something like "stop and listen." Another proposal is that ''Selah'' can be used to indicate that there is to be a musical interlude at that point in the Psalm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ancienthebrewpoetry.typepad.com/ancient_hebrew_poetry/2007/07/selah-in-the-ps.html | title=Selah in the Psalms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Amplified Bible]] translates ''selah'' as "pause, and think of that." It can also be interpreted as a form of underlining in preparation for the next paragraph.

At least some of the [[Psalms]] were sung accompanied by musical instruments and there are references to this in many chapters. Thirty-one of the thirty-nine psalms with the caption "To the choir-master" include the word ''selah''. ''Selah'' may indicate a break in the song whose purpose is similar to that of [[Amen]] (Hebrew: "so be it") in that it stresses the truth and importance of the preceding passage; this interpretation is consistent with the meaning of the Semitic root ''ṣ-l-ḥ'' also reflected in Arabic cognate ''salih'' (variously "valid" [in the logical sense of "truth-preserving"], "honest," and "righteous"). Alternatively, ''selah'' may mean "forever," as it does in some places in the liturgy (notably the second to last blessing of the [[Amidah]]). Another interpretation claims that ''selah'' comes from the primary Hebrew root word ''salah'' ({{hebrew|סָלָה}}) which means "to hang," and by implication to measure (weigh).&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite web

== Etymology ==
Its etymology and precise meaning are unknown. This word occurs seventy-one times in thirty-nine of the [[Psalms]] and three times in [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]] 3: altogether 74 times in the Bible. It is found at the end of Psalms 3, 24, and 46, and in most other cases at the end of a verse, the exceptions being Psalms 55:19, 57:3, and Hab. 3:3, 9, 13.

The significance of this term was apparently not known even by ancient [[Bible commentary|Biblical commentators]]. This can be seen by the variety of renderings given to it. The [[Septuagint]], [[Symmachus the Ebionite|Symmachus]], and [[Theodotion]] translate διάψαλμα (diapsalma, or "apart from psalm") — a word as enigmatic in Greek as is ''selah'' in Hebrew. The [[Hexapla]] simply transliterates σελ. [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], [[Jerome]], and the [[Targum]] translate it as "always." According to [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] (De Lagarde, "Novæ Psalterii Græci Editionis Specimen" 10), the Greek term διάψαλμα signified a change in rhythm or melody at the places marked by the term, or a change in thought and theme. Against this explanation Baethgen ("Psalmen," p.&amp;nbsp;15, 1st ed. Göttingen, 1892) notes that ''selah'' also occurs at the ''end'' of some psalms.

[[File:Stralsund, Germany, Nikolaikirche, Tür zur Semlower Straße, Detail (2006-09-29).JPG|thumb|"Sela" on a Tympanon of the ''Nikolaikirche'' in [[Stralsund]]]]

== Modern ideas ==
One proposed meaning is given by assigning it to the root, as an imperative that should not properly have been vocalized, "Sollah" (Ewald, "Kritische Grammatik der Hebräischen Sprache,"p. 554; König, "Historisch-Kritisches Lehrgebäude der Hebräischen Sprache," ii., part i., p.&amp;nbsp;539). The meaning of this imperative is given as "Lift up," equivalent to "loud" or "fortissimo," a direction to the accompanying musicians to break in at the place marked with crash of [[cymbal]]s and blare of [[trumpet]]s, the orchestra playing an interlude while the singers' voices were hushed. The effect, as far as the singer was concerned, was to mark a pause. This significance, too, has been read into the expression or sign, ''selah'' being held to be a variant of "shelah" (="pause").{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} But as the interchange of ''shin'' ש and ''samek'' ס is not usual in Biblical Hebrew, and as the meaning "pause" is not held to be applicable in the middle of a verse, or where a pause would interrupt the sequence of thought, this proposition has met with little favor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Grätz argues that ''selah'' introduces a new paragraph, and also in some instances a quotation (e.g., Psalms 57:8 et seq. from 108:2 et seq.) The fact that the term occurs four times at the end of a Psalm would not weigh against this theory. The Psalms were meant to be read in sequence, and, moreover, many of them are fragments; indeed, Psalm 9 is reckoned one with Psalm 10 in the Septuagint, which omits διάψαλμα (diapsalma) also at the end of Psalms 3, 24, 46 and 68  B. Jacob (l.c.) concludes (1) that since no etymological explanation is possible, ''selah'' signifies a pause in or for the Temple song; and (2) that its meaning was concealed lest the Temple privileges should be obtained by the synagogues or perhaps even by the churches.

''The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon'' shows that the main derivation of the Hebrew word ''selah'' is found through the [[dynamic verb|fientive]] verb root סֶ֜לָה which means "to lift up (voices)" or "to exalt," and also carries a close connotational relationship to the verb סָלַל, which is similar in meaning: "to lift up" or "to cast up."  The word סֶלָה, which shifts the accent back to the last syllable of the verb form, indicates that in this context, the verb is being used in the imperative mood as somewhat of a directive to the reader.  As such, perhaps the most instructive way to view the use of this word, particularly in the context of the Psalms, would be as the writer's instruction to the reader to pause and exalt the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, F., S. Driver, and C. Briggs.  ''The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon''.  Hendrickson Publishers, Inc.:  Peabody, MA, 2006.  (p. 699)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage ==
[[Gonzo journalist]] [[Hunter S. Thompson]] commonly used the word to end articles and personal letters.

Journalist, author and screenwriter [[George MacDonald Fraser]] used ''selah'' occasionally in [[The Flashman Papers]], a celebrated historical fiction series published between 1969 and 2005.

''Selah'' is used in [[Iyaric]] [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] vocabulary. It can be heard at the end of spoken-word segments of some [[reggae]] songs. Its usage here, again, is to accentuate the magnitude and importance of what has been said, and often is a sort of substitute for [[Amen]]. Notable, according to Rastafarian faith, is also the word's similarity with the incarnated god and savior Selassie (Ethiopia's former emperor [[Haile Selassie]]).

[[Furman Bisher]], the former sports editor and columnist for ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', for decades signed off his columns with "Selah."  The same is often done by political columnist and blogger [[Ed Kilgore]] at the close of a day's postings.

In ''[[Predator 2]]'', just before being killed by the predator, the Jamaican drug lord [[King Willie]] says, "His foundation lie in the holy mountain" before pausing and adding "Selah."

[[U2]] frontman [[Bono]] during a [[Jimmy Kimmel Live]] performance announced "Take you to church, Selah," right before the choir started singing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ylSoAxpcKk

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1518">'''British Library, Stowe 54''' is a French [[illuminated manuscript]] from the first quarter of the fifteenth century of the ''[[Histoire ancienne jusqu'à César]]'' ("Ancient History up to Caesar"), a medieval historical compilation recounting tales of the ancient world, especially the [[Trojan War]], the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] (particularly the [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)#Fall|Fall of Thebes]]), and the greatness of [[ancient Rome]].

The manuscript was copied in Paris from an earlier [[Naples|Neapolitan]] exemplar illuminated by [[Cristoforo Orimina]], also held by the British Library (Royal 20 D I). The illustrations in this copy were provided by an unidentified illuminator from the Low Countries, working in Paris.

The manuscript forms part of the [[Stowe manuscripts]] in the [[British Library]].

The '''''Taktikon Uspensky''''' or '''''Uspenskij''''' is the conventional name of a mid-9th century [[Greek language|Greek]] list of the civil, military and ecclesiastical offices of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and their precedence at the imperial court. [[Nicolas Oikonomides]] has dated it to 842/843,&lt;ref&gt;Oikonomides (1972), pp. 41ff.&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first of a series of such documents (''[[Taktika (disambiguation)|taktika]]'') extant from the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The document is named after the Russian Byzantinist [[Fyodor Uspensky]], who discovered it in the late 19th century in a 12th/13th-century manuscript (''codex Hierosolymitanus gr. 39'') in the library of the [[Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem]], which also contained a portion of the ''[[Kletorologion]]'' of Philotheos, a later ''taktikon''.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1911), pp. 10, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The DV Rebel's Guide: An All-Digital Approach to Making Killer Action Movies on the Cheap''''' is a non-fiction book and filmmaking handbook written by [[Stu Maschwitz]] for [[Peachpit|Peachpit Press]].  It was his first book, and has been called "a must-read for any and all filmmakers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldstein|first1=Taz|title=Hand held Hollywood's filmmaking with the iPad &amp; iPhone|date=2013|publisher=Peachpit Press|location=[Berkeley, Calif.]|isbn=978-0321862945}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''MircroFilmmaker Magazine'' named it an "industry icon."&lt;ref name=MMMag&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wannenmacher|first1=Michael|title=Book Review: The DV Rebel's Guide:  An all-digital approach to making killer action movies on the cheap!|url=http://www.microfilmmaker.com/reviews/Issue45/DVRebel.html|accessdate=January 10, 2016|work=Microfilmmaker Magazine|issue=#45|publisher=Viking Productions, Inc.|date=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Maschwitz publicly announced he was working on the book in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maschwitz|first1=Stu|title=The Bag is Out From Around the Cat|url=http://prolost.com/blog/2006/2/3/the-bag-is-out-from-around-the-cat.html|website=Prolost|accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially published on December 22 of that year. &lt;ref name="Peachpit site"&gt;{{cite web|title=DV Rebel's Guide, The: An All-Digital Approach to Making Killer Action Movies on the Cheap|url=http://www.peachpit.com/store/dv-rebels-guide-an-all-digital-approach-to-making-killer-9780321413642|website=www.peachpit.com|publisher=Peachpit Press|accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
''The DV Rebel's Guide'' explores making action movies within the constraints of small or nonexistent budgets. Focus is given to working with inexpensive DV cameras. [[Stu Maschwitz|Maschwitz]] has a background as a film and commercial director, visual effects artist, and indie filmmaker.  He cites that experience in the book while discussing a variety of filmmaking topics.  Some of the areas covered include: 
* Achieving a high production value 
* Planning an indie film production 
* Shooting and acquiring footage 
* Creating visual effects and special effects on a small budget 
* Editing style and technique 
* Online editing of DV footage for maximum quality
Maschwitz also references numerous scenes from Hollywood films and suggests watching the films discussed in each chapter.  Those scenes are analyzed, with suggestions offered to achieve similar results for little or no money. 

The book shipped with an accompanying DVD which included: 
* An extra chapter examining the selection and use of cameras 
* ''The Last Birthday Card,'' a short film filmed, directed, and edited by Maschwitz 
* Assorted visual effects tools 
Maschwitz states that his blog ''Prolost'' is the evolving, electronic update to the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maschwitz|first1=Stu|title=Rebel's Guide on your iPad or Kindle, DV Rebel Tools For Free|url=http://prolost.com/blog/2011/3/30/rebels-guide-on-your-ipad-or-kindle-dv-rebel-tools-for-free.html|website=Prolost|accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
The writing style of the book has been called casual, conversational, and user friendly.&lt;ref name=MMMag&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Maschwitz stated that the conversational feel was something he felt passionately about, and spoke with the publisher ahead of time to ensure they understood the tone he was pursuing.&lt;ref name=FXG&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montgomery|first1=John|title=DV Rebel with a Cause|url=https://www.fxguide.com/featured/dv_rebel_with_a_cause/|accessdate=January 11, 2016|work=FX Guide|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cover design ==
The cover was designed by Mimi Heft,&lt;ref name=DVReb&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a designer for Peachpit Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff: Peachpit|url=http://www.peachpit.com/about/staff.aspx|website=www.peachpit.com|accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It features images of bullet holes, and looks as if it was burned at the edge.  Additionally, the entire book was printed with curved corners on the right-hand side.  Of the cover, Maschwitz said, "The tough sell was the rounded corners!"&lt;ref name=FXG&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

A blurb for the book was written by film director [[Robert Rodriguez]], who said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''I'd been wanting to write a book for the new breed of digital filmmakers, but now I don't have to.  My pal and fellow movie maker Stu Maschwitz has compressed years of experience into this thorough guide.  Don't make a movie without reading this book!"''&lt;ref name=DVReb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maschwitz|first1=Stu|title=The DV rebel's guide : an all-digital approach to making killer action movies on the cheap|date=2007|publisher=Peachpit Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-0321413642|page=back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Microfilmmaker Magazine'' gave it an ''Award of Superiority.''&lt;ref name=MMMag&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

''FX Guide'' said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''While the book covers many concepts that will admittedly be familiar to artists working on visual effects or who went to film school, its such an enjoyable read of tales in the trenches that you stick around for the nuggets of knowledge.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Literary Encyclopedia''''' is an [[online]] [[reference work]] first published in October 2000. &lt;ref name="ws"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/|title=Literary Encyclopedia {{!}} Welcome|website=www.litencyc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded as an innovative project designed to bring the benefits of information technology to what at the time was still a largely conservative literary field. From its inception it was developed as a not-for-profit publication aimed to ensure that those who contribute to it are properly rewarded for the time and knowledge they invest - as such, its authors and editors are also shareholders in the Company.

''The Literary Encyclopedia'' offers both freely available content and content and services for subscribers (individual and institutional, consisting mainly of higher education institutions and higher level secondary schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.litencyc.com/subscriberlist.php|title=List of Institutional Subscribers|last=|first=|date=|website=The Literary Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Articles are solicited by invitation from specialist scholars, then refereed and approved by subject editors &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.litencyc.com/litencycdescribed.php|title=The Literary Encyclopedia - Brief Description|last=|first=|date=|website=The Literary Encylopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which makes the ''LE'' both authoritative and reliable. It contains general profiles of literary writers, but also of major cultural, historical and scientific figures; articles on individual works of literature from all over the world (often containing succinct critical commentary and sections on critical reception); entries on hundreds of literary terms, concepts and movements, as well as extended essays on topics of historical and cultural importance. 

''The Literary Encyclopedia'' offers free access, upon request, to its entire database to all educational institutions in countries where the GDP is below the world average. Librarians or teachers at such institutions can view the publication's [https://www.litencyc.com/subscription_rates.php Subscribe] page for more details. It also offers a number of [https://www.litencyc.com/php/travel_award.php annual travel/ research grants] to young and emerging scholars in its subscribing institutions, funded by royalties donated by the publication's contributors and editors.

The encyclopedia's founding editors were [https://www.litencyc.com/php/members/editors/robert_clark_profile.php Dr Robert Clark] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.litencyc.com/php/members/editors/robert_clark_profile.php Dr Robert Clark], Founding Editor, The Literary Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; ([[University of East Anglia]]), [https://www.litencyc.com/php/members/editors/emory_elliott_profile.php Prof. Emory Elliott] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.litencyc.com/php/members/editors/emory_elliott_profile.php Emory Elliott], Founding Editor, The Literary Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; ([[University of California, Riverside|University of California at Riverside]]) and [https://www.litencyc.com/php/members/editors/janet_todd_profile.php Prof. Janet Todd] ([[University of Cambridge]]), and its current [https://www.litencyc.com/editors.php editorial board] numbers over 100 distinguished scholars from higher education institutions all over the world.

Written and owned by a global network of scholars and researchers, ''The Literary Encyclopedia'' is an ongoing project. So far, it has published over 8000 articles in 16.8 million words&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.litencyc.com/litencyc_content.php|title=The Literary Encyclopedia - Content|last=|first=|date=|website=The Literary Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, on a wide range of authors, works and topics in world literature, from the classical to the postcolonial. It continues to publish an average of 20-40 new articles every month, and subscribers benefit from considerable cross-referencing possibilities to its articles under the form of lists of recommended critical bibliographies, course-specific bookshelves, and clusters of related articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3302">'''The Paul Pert Screen Collection''' is a privately owned resource consisting of several thousand original items of printed ephemera, studio publicity and merchandise produced in connection with classic and 'cult' televisual entertainment, dating predominantly from the period now affectionately referred to - on both sides of the Atlantic - as the 'Golden Age' of television.

The collection also extends into the realms of other periods, including classic television productions of the 1970s and '80s retaining sufficient merit as to warrant inclusion, and selective areas of cinema. There is also a section of the archive dedicated to optical and screen entertainment in its earliest forms, stemming from an interest in the history and development of the moving image.

The archive is grouped into 'themed' collections, in order to focus on particular shows, films, genres, studios or actors etc. - as often required to do so - in the most comprehensive manner. Access to the collection has been principally via digital reproduction since 2003, but all objects are retained in a dedicated archive store, meaning that original items may be loaned, for example for filming or exhibition.  Users range from television companies, graphic designers, documentary makers, magazine editors and companies releasing classic films and television shows on DVD and Blu-ray etc., who are looking for quality images of original press and tie-in material, and accompanying literature, for sleeve design and/or special features galleries. Items from the collection have appeared on [[BBC Four]] documentaries, and DVD releases of 'cult' and classic TV shows released by companies such as [[Umbrella Entertainment]] and [[Shock Records]] in Australia, and [[Network DVD]] in the UK. Releases include TV shows such as ''[[Arthur of the Britons]]'' and Smuggler (both starring [[Oliver Tobias]] ), ''[[The Adventures of Black Beauty]], [[Catweazle]], [[Follyfoot]]'', and others. Also [[ITC Entertainment]] classics such as ''[[The Baron]], [[The Champions]], [[Danger Man]], [[Jason King (TV series)|Jason King]], [[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]], [[The Zoo Gang]]'' etc.

In common with most libraries and archives, no rights are given or implied in respect of the material, and copyright therefore rests with original creators. The collection has an international flavour and consists of items from all over the world.

Proprietor of the collection, Paul Pert, has worked in the museum world for over twenty-five years. From a show-business family, he was singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist with several pop/rock bands in the late 1980s and early '90s and has since written articles on various aspects of British history and culture, including music, cinema, television and theatre. His brother is singer/songwriter Steve Pert, originally a member of international vocal group 'Wall Street Crash' and now a familiar face on the British Jazz and Swing circuit with bands such as 'The Vegas Giants'.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The World Factbook'' list of developed countries}}
In an appendix to the ''[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[The World Factbook]]'', there is an entry identifying '''developed countries''' ('''DCs''').&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-b.html#D|title=Appendix B. International Organizations and Groups. World Factbook.|author=CIA|date=2011|accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ciaWFB1999&gt;http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact99/361.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This list of DCs is identical to the list in ''[[The World Factbook]]'' published as early as 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States Central Intelligence Agency|title=The 1991 CIA World Factbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f108AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2117|year=1991|pages=2117–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA notes that the DCs form

:''the top group in the hierarchy of developed countries (DCs), former USSR/Eastern Europe (former USSR/EE), and less developed countries (LDCs);''&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

The CIA argues that this list

:''includes the market-oriented economies of the mainly democratic nations in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).''&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

However, ten new countries have joined the OECD since this list was created in the early 1990s: [[India]] (1994), the [[Czech Republic]] (1997, [[South Korea]] (1996), [[Hungary]] (1996), [[Poland]] (1996), [[Slovakia]] (2000), [[Chile]] (2010), [[Slovenia]] (2010), [[Israel]] (2010) and [[Estonia]] (2010).

The CIA argues that the countries in its list are

:''also known as the First World, high-income countries, the North, industrial countries;''&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

The CIA notes that these countries

:''generally have a per capita GDP in excess of $15,000; although four OECD countries and South Africa have figures well under $15,000; and eight of the excluded OPEC countries have figures of more than $20,000.''&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

These descriptions are based on 2010 GDP per capita figures. As of 2017, four members of the OECD have a GDP per capita of less than $15,000 in nominal terms (Poland, Hungary, Turkey and Mexico) and, as of 2017, five OPEC countries have a GDP per capita that is higher than $20,000 (Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE and Saudi Arabia).

The CIA notes that the 30 DCs are as follows:&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

* {{flagcountry|Australia}}
* {{flagcountry|Austria}}
* {{flagcountry|Belgium}}
* {{flagcountry|Canada}}
* {{flagcountry|Cyprus}}
* {{flagcountry|Czech Republic}}
* {{flagcountry|Denmark}}
* {{flagcountry|Estonia}}
* {{flagcountry|Finland}}
* {{flagcountry|France}}
* {{flagcountry|Germany}}
* {{flagcountry|Greece}}
* {{flagcountry|Iceland}}
* {{flagcountry|Ireland}}
* {{flagcountry|Israel}}
* {{flagcountry|Italy}}
* {{flagcountry|Japan}}
* {{flagcountry|Luxembourg}}
* {{flagcountry|Monaco}}
* {{flagcountry|Netherlands}}
* {{flagcountry|New Zealand}}
* {{flagcountry|Norway}}
* {{flagcountry|Portugal}}
* {{flagcountry|Slovenia}}
* {{flagcountry|Spain}}
* {{flagcountry|Sweden}}
* {{flagcountry|Singapore}}
* {{flagcountry|Switzerland}}
* {{flagcountry|United Kingdom}}
* {{flagcountry|United States}}

The CIA concludes its definition with the note that this list is

:''similar to the new [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) term "advanced economies" that adds [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[Singapore]], and [[Taiwan]]; but drops Malta, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey.''&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

This description is based on an old version of the IMF's list and also erroneously implies that Mexico is on the CIA's Developed Country (DC) list. In the same way, the new IMF's list also includes [[Malta]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]] among "advanced economies".

{{about||the form of democracy|Ochlocracy|the Flesh Field album|Tyranny of the Majority (album)}}
{{Democracy}}
The '''tyranny of the majority''' (or '''tyranny of the masses''') is an inherent weakness of [[majority rule]] in which the majority of an electorate can and does place its own interests above, and at the expense of, those in the minority. This results in [[oppression]] of minority groups comparable to that of a [[tyrant]] or [[Despotism|despot]], argued [[John Stuart Mill]] in his 1859 book ''[[On Liberty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill. [https://books.google.com/books?id=f14SAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22John+Stuart+Mill%22+%22On+Liberty%22+%22tyranny+of+the+majority%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9QotTKaHO5CTnQetrpS1Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Liberty, The Library of Liberal Arts edition, p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Founding Fathers of the United States|American founding father]] [[Alexander Hamilton]], writing to [[Thomas Jefferson]] from the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], argued the same fears regarding the use of pure direct democracy by the majority to elect a [[demagogue]] who, rather than work for the benefit of all citizens, set out to either harm those in the minority or work only for those of the upper echelon. The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] mechanism present in the indirect [[United States presidential election]] system, and the phenomenon of [[faithless electors]] allowed for within it, was, in part, deliberately created as a safety measure not only to prevent such a scenario, but also to prevent the use of democracy to overthrow democracy for an [[authoritarian]], [[dictatorial]] or other system of oppressive government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-electoral-college-is-anti-democraticand-thats-a-good-thing-2016-09-12 | title=The Electoral College is anti-democratic—and that's a good thing}}&lt;/ref&gt; As articulated by Hamilton, one reason the Electoral College was created was so "that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp | title=The Avalon Project : Federalist No 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenarios in which tyranny perception occurs are very specific, involving a sort of distortion of democracy preconditions:
 
*  [[Centralization]] excess: when the centralized power of a [[federation]] make a decision that should be ''local'', breaking with the commitment to the [[Subsidiarity|subsidiarity principle]].&lt;ref name="lacy94"/&gt; Typical solutions, in this condition, are [[#Concurrent majority|concurrent majority]] and  [[supermajority]] rules.
*  Abandonment of [[rationality]]: when, as [[Tocqueville]] remembered, a decision "which bases its claim to rule upon numbers, not upon rightness or excellence".&lt;ref name="deneen15"&gt;P. J. Deneen (2015) "[http://www.theimaginativeconservative.org/2015/03/equality-tyranny-and-despotism-in-democracy-remembering-alexis-de-tocqueville.html Equality, Tyranny, and Despotism in Democracy: Remembering Alexis de Tocqueville]", 2015s &lt;tt&gt;theimaginativeconservative.org&lt;/tt&gt; article.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[public consultation]], [[Public sector consulting|technical consulting bodies]], and other similar mechanisms help to improve rationality of decisions before voting on them. [[Judicial review]] (e.g. [[Legal nullity|declaration of nullity]] of the decision) is the typical way after the vote.

In both cases, in a context of a nation, [[constitution]]al limits on the powers of a legislative body, and the introduction of a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] have been used to counter the problem.&lt;ref name="Przeworski"&gt;A Przeworski, JM Maravall, I NetLibrary ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EMB-F6Forx8C Democracy and the Rule of Law]'' (2003) p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[separation of powers]] (for example a [[legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] majority actions subject to review by the [[judiciary]]) may also be implemented to prevent the problem from happening internally in a government.&lt;ref name="Przeworski"/&gt;

==Term==
A term used in [[Classical Greece|Classical]] and [[Hellenistic Greece]] for oppressive popular rule was ''[[ochlocracy]]'' ("mob rule"). ''[[Tyranny]]'' meant rule by one man whether undesirable or not. 

While [[James Madison]] referred to the same idea as "the violence of majority faction" in [[The Federalist Papers]], for example [[Federalist 10]], the phrase "tyranny of the majority" was used by [[John Adams]] in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Adams]], ''A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America'', Vol. 3 (London: 1788), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by [[Edmund Burke]] in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), where he said that "The tyranny of a multitude is a multiplied tyranny." It was further popularised by [[John Stuart Mill]] in ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859). ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' and the phrase (in translation) is used at least once in the first sequel to ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (1879).&lt;ref&gt;See for example maxim 89 of Friedrich Nietzsche, ''Human, All Too Human: First Sequel: Mixed Opinions and Maxims'', 1879&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ayn Rand]] wrote that individual rights are not subject to a public vote, and that the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities and "the smallest minority on earth is the individual".&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand (1961), [http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualrights.html ''"Collectivized 'Rights,'"''] The Virtue of Selfishness.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s 1965 essay "''[[Repressive Tolerance]]''", he said "tolerance is extended to policies, conditions, and modes of behavior which should not be tolerated because they are impeding, if not destroying, the chances of creating an existence without fear and misery" and that "this sort of tolerance strengthens the tyranny of the majority against which authentic liberals protested".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/60spubs/65repressivetolerance.htm ''The Repressive Tolerance'' by Herbert Marcuse]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, legal scholar [[Lani Guinier]] used the phrase as the title for a collection of [[law review]] articles.&lt;ref&gt;Lani Guinier, ''The Tyranny of the Majority'' (Free Press: 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trampling the rights of minorities ===
Regarding recent American politics (specifically [[initiative]]s), Donovan et al. argue that:
{{quote|One of the original concerns about direct democracy is the potential it has to allow a majority of voters to trample the rights of minorities. Many still worry that the process can be used to harm gays and lesbians as well as ethnic, linguistic, and religious minorities. ... Recent scholarly research shows that the initiative process is sometimes prone to produce laws that disadvantage relatively powerless minorities ... State and local ballot initiatives have been used to undo policies – such as school desegregation, protections against job and housing discrimination, and affirmative action – that minorities have secured from legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Todd Donovan et al|title=State and Local Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G4ocCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131|year=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=131|isbn=9781285441405}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Public choice theory===
The notion that, in a democracy, the greatest concern is that the majority will tyrannise and exploit diverse smaller interests, has been criticised by [[Mancur Olson]] in ''[[The Logic of Collective Action]]'', who argues instead that narrow and well organised minorities are more likely to assert their interests over those of the majority. Olson argues that when the benefits of political action (e.g., lobbying) are spread over fewer agents, there is a stronger individual incentive to contribute to that political activity. Narrow groups, especially those who can reward active participation to their group goals, might therefore be able to dominate or distort political process, a process studied in [[public choice theory]].

===Vote trading===
Anti-federalists of public choice theory point out that [[vote trading]] can protect minority interests from majorities in representative democratic bodies such as legislatures.{{Citation needed|reason=no example is given of such anti-fedarilsts making such claims|date=May 2014}} They continue that direct democracy, such as statewide propositions on ballots, does not offer such protections.{{Weasel inline|date=June 2013}}

== Examples ==
{{Original research|section|discuss=Talk:Tyranny_of_the_majority#Original_Research|date=June 2016}}
[[File:Illustrating-ConcurrentMajority-fig1.png|thumb|320px|A collective decision of 13 voters in a deliberative assembly. Result: 8 votes for ''X'' (blue) and 5 votes for ''Y'' (red). ''X'' option wins, because it has a majority (more than half).]]

The "no tyranny" and "tyranny" situations can be characterizated in any simple democratic decision-making context, as a [[deliberative assembly|deliberative ''assembly'']].

=== Abandonment of rationality  ===
[[Herbert Spencer]], in "The Right to Ignore the State" (1851), pointed the problem with the following example:&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Spencer (1851), http://www.panarchy.org/spencer/ignore.state.1851.html&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Suppose, for the sake of argument, that, struck by some [[Malthusian growth model|Malthusian panic]], a legislature duly representing public opinion were to enact that all children born during the next ten years should be drowned. Does anyone think such an enactment would be warrantable? If not, there is evidently a limit to the power of a majority.}}

=== Usual no-tyranny scenario ===
Suppose a deliberative assembly of a [[condominium|building
condominium]]  with 13 voters, deciding, with majority rule, about "''X'' or ''Y''",

{{block indent|''X'': to paint some common rooms (as game room, lobby and each floor's hall) with blue color.}}
{{block indent|''Y'': to paint with red color.}}

Suppose that the final result is "8 votes for ''X'' and 5 votes for ''Y''", so 8, as a majority, blue wins. As collectively (13 voters) the decision is legitimate.

It is a centralized decision about all common use rooms, "one color for all rooms", and it is also legitimate. Voters have some arguments against "each room with its color", rationalizing the centralization: some say that common rooms need uniform decisions;
some prefer the homogeneous color style, and all other voters have no style preference;
an economic analysis demonstrates (and all agree) that a wholesale purchase of ''one'' color paint for all rooms is better.

=== Federated centralization excess  ===
Centralization excess is the most usual case. Suppose that each floor has some kind of local governance, so in some aspects the condominium is a "[[federation]] of floors".  Suppose that only on the third floor the majority of residents manifested some preference to "each floor with different color" style, and all of the third floor residents likes the red color. The cost difference, to purchase another color for one floor, is not significant when compared with the condominium contributions.

In this conditions some tyranny perception arrives, and the [[Subsidiarity|subsidiarity principle]] can be used to contest the central decision.

=== Tyranny emerging  ===
[[File:Illustrating-ConcurrentMajority-fig4.png|thumb|320px|Minority and tyranny characterized: a coherent subset of voters with some collective action; a central decision; the ''subsidiarity principle'' can be used by minority group decision.]]

In the [[#Usual no-tyranny scenario|above no-tyranny scenario]], suppose no floor federation, but (only) a room with some local governance.
Suppose that the ''gym room'' is not used by all, but there is a "community" of regulars, there is a grouping of voters by its activity as [[Sprinter (cycling)|speed-cyclists]] (illustrated as spiked hair), that have the gym room key for some activities on Sundays. They are acting collectively to preserve the gym room for a local cyclists group.

In this situation the following facts hold:

* There is a [[subset]] of voters and some [[collective action]], uniting them, making them a cohesive group.
* There is some [[centralization]] (a general assembly) and some ''central decision'' (over local decision): there is no choice of "each room decision" or "each ''regulars' community'' decision". So it is a ''central decision''.
* The [[Subsidiarity|subsidiarity principle]] can be applied: there is an "embryonic [[Local government|local governance]]" connecting  the cyclists, and the other people (voters) of the condominium recognise the group, transferring some (little) responsibility to them (the keys of the gym room and right to advocate their cycling activities to other residents).

There is no "enforced [[minoritarianism]]"; it seems a legitimate characterization of a relevant (and not [[Dominant minority|dominant]]) minority. This is a ''tyranny of the majority'' situation because:
* there is a little "global gain" in a global decision (where ''X'' wins), and a good "local gain" in local decision (local ''Y'' preference);
* there is relevant voting for a local decision:  6 voters (46%) are ''gym room'' regulars, 5 that voted ''Y''. The majority of them (83%) voted ''Y''.

In this situation, even with no [[federation|formal federation structure]], the minority and a potential local governance emerged: the tyranny perception arrives with it.

==Concurrent majority==
{{Main article|Concurrent majority}}

Secession of the [[Confederate States of America]] from the United States was anchored by a version of [[subsidiarity]], found within the doctrines of [[John C. Calhoun]]. [[Antebellum South Carolina]] utilized Calhoun's doctrines in the [[Old South]] as public policy, adopted from his theory of [[concurrent majority]]. This "localism" strategy was presented as a mechanism to circumvent Calhoun's perceived tyranny of the majority in the United States. Each state presumptively held the Sovereign power to block federal laws that infringed upon [[states' rights]], autonomously. Calhoun's policies directly influenced Southern public policy regarding slavery, and undermined the [[Supremacy Clause]] power granted to the federal government. The subsequent creation of the [[Confederate States of America]] catalyzed the [[American Civil War]].

19th century concurrent majority theories held logical counterbalances to standard tyranny of the majority harms originating from [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] and onward. Essentially, illegitimate or temporary coalitions that held majority volume could disproportionately outweigh and hurt any significant minority, by nature and sheer volume. Calhoun's contemporary doctrine was presented as one of limitation within American democracy to prevent traditional tyranny, whether actual or imagined.&lt;ref name="lacy94"&gt;Lacy K. Ford Jr., "Inventing the Concurrent Majority: Madison, Calhoun, and the Problem of Majoritarianism in American Political Thought", ''The Journal of Southern History,'' Vol. 60, No. 1 (Feb., 1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;19–58 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2210719 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Illustrating-ConcurrentMajority-fig2.png|thumb|320px|The global voting shows a ''precedent'' to use of ''concurrent majority'' for   the "one color for all rooms" central tyrannized decision. Majority color (blue) is used at one room, and the concurrent majority at its correlated room (red).]]
