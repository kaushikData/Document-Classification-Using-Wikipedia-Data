[[File:Andrex puppy (1994 advert).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Andrex Puppy, seen here in a [[Great Britain|British]] advertisement from 1994.]]
'''Andrex''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] brand of [[toilet roll]].  It is owned by the [[United States|American]] company [[Kimberly-Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrex.co.uk/aboutus/aboutus.aspx|title=About Us |publisher=Andrex.co.uk|accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Andrex Puppy", a [[Labrador Retriever]] [[puppy]] that appears on the company's television [[advert]]s, is synonymous with the brand.

Its sister brand in the U.S. and Australia is ''[[Kleenex]] [[Cottonelle]]'', and in Germany as just ''Cottonelle.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cottonelle.de/|title=Cottonelle Homepage|website=www.cottonelle.de|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Netherlands]], Andrex is known as ''Page''.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KIMBERLY-CLARK+COMBINES+BRANDS+TO+CREATE+KLEENEX+COTTONELLE+BATHROOM...-a018037211|title=Kimberly-Clark Combines Brands to Create Kleenex Cottonelle Bathroom Tissue|publisher=The Free Library|accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] it is branded as ''Scottex''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottex.com/|title=scottex|accessdate=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the puppy is known as the "Kleenex Puppy" and Kleenex is a partner and supporter of [[Guide Dogs Australia]].

==History==

Andrex was originally developed in 1942 by paper manufacturer St Andrew Mills Ltd., as a disposable handkerchief. [[Harrods]] department store in London sold the handkerchiefs exclusively. Before Andrex, brands such as Bronco and [[Izal (brand)|Izal]] produced products that were harsher. They were mainly sold through chemists and known as “shinies”.&lt;ref name="Brand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/189282/Superbrands-case-studies-Andrex|title=Superbrands case studies: Andrex|publisher=Brand Republic|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Andrex comes from St Andrew Mill, on St Andrews Road in [[Walthamstow]], where the toilet tissue was first made. The concept of two ply luxury paper had been inspired by the facial tissues used by American women, as witnessed by the man who created the name Andrex, Ronald Keith Kent. It was the first two-ply tissue.

St Andrew Mills was taken-over by Bower in 1955, and in 1956, Bowater formed a joint venture with the [[Scott Paper Company]], Bowater-Scott, that specialized in tissue products including Andrex.

One of the most popular TV ads in the UK almost did not happen. The original idea in 1972 was for a girl to run through a house trailing a roll of Andrex. The television regulators did not approve this as they felt it encouraged children to be wasteful.&lt;ref name="Brand" /&gt; Bowater-Scott's Marketing Director, Raymond Dinkin decided to use a Labrador puppy instead. Since then there have been 130 different adverts featuring the puppy.

In 1986, Bowater sold Bowater-Scott to Scott Paper, and in 1995, [[Kimberly-Clark]] purchased Scott Paper.

Andrex says that it marketed the first moist toilet paper in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.andrex.co.uk/brand-history/|title=Brand History|publisher=Andrex|quote=Andrex® are always trying to be a forefront of toilet tissue innovation, and in 1992 were the first to launch moist tissues.|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Andrex replaced its advertising slogan “Soft, Strong and very very Long”, with “Tuggable, Huggable softness”, and changed to “Be Kind To Your Behind” in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adrants.com/2008/03/cottonelle-wants-to-be-kind-to-your.php&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, it was using the slogans “Andrex clean” and “How Andrex do you feel?”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.andrex.co.uk/clean/|title=Andrex clean|publisher=Andrex|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
All Andrex mainstream is made in [[Northfleet]]. Factories in [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]] and [[Barrow in Furness]] 
supplement production on the mainline product, along with the Puppies on a Roll, Aloe Vera and Quilts variations.

[[File:Asahi Pentax logo.JPG|thumb|Asahi Pentax logo on a [[Pentax K1000]] ]]
The '''Asahi Pentax''' series, by the {{nihongo|[[Pentax|Asahi Optical Co., Ltd.]]|旭光学工業株式会社|Asahi Kōgaku Kōgyō Kabushiki-gaisha}}, was a pivotal development in modern photography. They were the earliest [[Pentax cameras]].

== Background ==
[[File:Asahi Pentax S3 with film.jpg|thumb|Asahi Pentax S3 camera|alt=An Asahi Pentax S3 camera, facing slightly off-center, with a roll of 35mm film to one side to provide scale]]
In 1957, the Asahi Optical Company (later "Pentax") introduced the '''Pentax''', a [[135 film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] [[Single-lens reflex camera]] (SLR) [[camera]] which was so well received that it influenced the design of 35&amp;nbsp;mm SLRs worldwide for years to come.

The Pentax and its later development and likewise classic 1964 [[Pentax Spotmatic]] allowed Asahi Optical Company to develop into a photographic [[multinational company]], eventually leading the company to rename itself "Pentax" after its seminal product.

== Features and market impact ==
The Asahi Pentax of 1957 featured:

* Rapid-wind film advance lever. Earlier 35&amp;nbsp;mm SLRs, with the sole exception of [[Exakta]]'s left-handed lever, had knob winders.
* Film rewind crank, likewise a first for 35&amp;nbsp;mm SLRs.
* Instant mirror return, unique to the Pentax and its immediate predecessor, the [[Asahiflex IIb]]
* Microprism focusing aids on the focus screen, unique to the Pentax

Moreover, the Pentax placed controls in locations that would become standard on 35&amp;nbsp;mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted rewind release. It also had a [[film speed]] reminder around the film rewind crank, a location that remained standard until the dial went from being merely a reminder to the photographer to actually controlling the [[light meter]] built into later SLRs.

The two photographic giants, [[Canon (company)|Canon]] and [[Nikon]] did not introduce their own SLR cameras until 1959 with the [[Canon Canonflex|Canonflex]] and the [[Nikon F|F-series]] respectively. By contrast, the Pentax offered these features at a relatively low price, introducing many photographers to 35&amp;nbsp;mm SLR photography.

The Pentax became so dominant that the [[M42 lens mount|42 mm screw lens mount]] used on the Pentax and [[Pentax Spotmatic]] become known as the "Pentax universal screw mount" although it had actually been introduced by [[Contax]] in 1949. Previously most makes of camera used proprietary mounts; the use of this mount by other manufacturers allowed owners of M42-equipped cameras to mount lenses from [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]], [[Yashica]], [[Soligor]], [[Vivitar]], [[Topcon]], [[Sigma Corporation|Sigma]], [[Chinon Industries|Chinon]], and many more as well as Asahi's own highly regarded [[Takumar]] lenses. These lenses had no other communication with the camera than a diaphragm interface which allowed focusing at full aperture, the lens being stopped down to working aperture on pressing the shutter release. Later cameras required more lens-body communication to implement [[shutter priority]] exposure, program auto exposure, and finally, [[autofocus]]sing, and different manufacturers used different interfaces, ending the era of interoperability. In 1975 Pentax introduced the [[Pentax K mount|K mount]] to replace the [[M42 lens mount|42 mm screw lens mount]] used so successfully until then.

[[File:Augustus Moore Herring.jpg|thumb|300px|An early glider by Herring]]
'''Augustus Moore Herring''' (August 3, 1867 &amp;ndash; July 17, 1926)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=herring&amp;GSfn=augustus&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=52631344&amp;df=all&amp; Augustus M. Herring; findagrave.com] Retrieved November 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; was an American aviation pioneer, who sometimes is claimed by Michigan promoters to be the first true aviator of a motorized [[heavier-than-air]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swmidirectory.org/First_in_Flight.html America's First Airplane Flight :: The Southwest Michigan Directory]. Swmidirectory.org. Retrieved on 2011-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Herring was born in [[Covington, Georgia|Covington]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to William F. Herring, a wealthy cotton broker, and his wife Cloe Perry Conyers. He studied in both [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]], before his family settled in New York in 1884. In 1885-6, as a student at the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], Herring was already building models of flying machines. By 1893, he had built a full sized glider – which he crashed when trying to leave the ground. He began studying glider expert [[Otto Lilienthal]]'s work. In 1894, Herring built a Type 11-monoplane glider based on [[Otto Lilienthal]]‘s 1893 German patent.

Herring was then hired by [[Octave Chanute]] to build and test aircraft models from plans drawn up by either Herring and Chanute. Later in 1895, [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] hired Herring to assist in his experiments. Herring was rehired by Chanute in January 1896, but continued experimenting on his own. In December 1896, he applied for a patent of a man-supporting, heavier-than-air "flying machine" that was motor powered and controllable, but the patent application was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spicerweb.org/chanute/biblio2.aspx Chanute Bibliography]. Spicerweb.org. Retrieved on 2011-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 1898, Herring telegraphed Chanute to come and watch him fly a powered aeroplane of his own design, based on the Chanute-type biplane structure, using a compressed air engine at [[Silver Beach Amusement Park]] in [[St. Joseph, Michigan]]. He could not get airborne. Herring was reported to have made a longer flight on October 22, witnessed by two locals.
 
In 1909 Herring joined [[Glenn Curtiss]] to create the [[Herring-Curtiss Company]]. The next year, he left Curtiss and joined [[Starling Burgess]] in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]] to design and build aeroplanes. He left Burgess after a year, following disagreements with another Burgess partner, Greely S. Curtis. Herring brought suit against Glenn Curtiss, claiming he had been cheated out of his property and ideas, but we have to remember that the patent Herring claimed to have did not exist.

Herring did some aviation design work for the [[United States Army]] during [[World War I]], he later was partially paralyzed by a series of strokes.

He died in 1926 at the age of 59, survived by his wife, the former Lillian Mellen. Ironically, four years later Herring won his suit against Curtiss with a sizeable financial award.

==Claims as first to fly==

Aviation historian Phil Scott in ''The Shoulders of Giants: A History of Human Flight to 1919'' (1995, {{ISBN|0-201-62722-1}}) wrote that he does not consider Herring a candidate for the first flight claim. Scott says Herring's glider was difficult to steer and his two-cylinder, three-horsepower compressed air engine could operate for only 30 seconds at a time. Scott considers Herring as having simply expanded the traditional hang-gliding by adding an engine.

Herring's defenders point out that hang-glider fliers today steer their aircraft by shifting their body, as Herring did. This method was superseded by the [[Wright Brothers]] system of dynamic three axis control used by most aircraft flying today.

[[Image:Baggage claim 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Baggage reclaim area at the [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]].]]
In [[airport terminal]]s, a '''baggage reclaim''' area is an area where arriving passengers claim checked-in [[baggage]] after disembarking from an [[airline]] [[fixed-wing aircraft|flight]].&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Brian|title=The modern airport terminal: new approaches to airport architecture|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=New York|isbn=0-415-24812-4|pages=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJzvuXxscc4C&amp;dq=%22Baggage+claim%22+airport|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative term '''baggage claim''' is used at airports in the USA and some other airports internationally.&lt;ref name=Edwards /&gt; Similar systems are also used at train stations served by companies that offer checked bags, such as [[Amtrak]] in the United States.

==Overview==
A typical baggage claim area contains [[baggage carousel]]s or [[conveyor system]]s that deliver checked baggage to the passenger. The baggage claim area generally contains the airline's customer service counter for claiming oversized baggage or to report missing or damaged baggage.

Some airports required that passengers display their [[bag tag|baggage]] receipt obtained at check-in so that it can be positively matched against the bag they are trying to remove from baggage reclaim, and many airports still recommend he baggage receipt is checked against the bag tag of the bag reclaimed. This serves two purposes: first it reduces baggage theft, and secondly it helps to prevent passengers from accidentally leaving the airport with another passenger's bag that bears resemblance to their own.

For international arrivals, the baggage reclaim area is a restricted area, after [[immigration control|passport and visa control]] and before clearing [[customs]], so that all baggage can be inspected by customs agents,&lt;ref name=Cassidy&gt;{{cite book|title=Airport passenger-related processing rates guidebook|year=2009|isbn=0-309-11805-0|pages=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XXmlIw-lzwC&amp;dq=%22Baggage+claim%22+airport|author=Michael James Cassidy |author2=Joseph D. Navarrete |publisher=Transportation Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the passenger does not have to handle heavy baggage while moving through the passport booth. In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and also in some airports in [[Asia]], all arriving international passengers' baggage is reclaimed here and can be re-surrendered to the airline for connecting flights on the other side of customs (for connection from international to domestic flights in most countries, all passengers must reclaim their baggage). In most other countries passengers transferring to an onward flight do not need to collect their bags unless their airline does not offer to through-check their bags to their final destination. This is required in American and some Canadian airports because international terminals are not enclosed (the only exit being through customs) and often serve domestic flights. The same rule applies in the case of airports that have [[U.S. border preclearance]] facilities. This means that passengers continuing onto the U.S. from other cities must retrieve their checked baggage first, then re-check them in after clearing U.S. Customs.

Depending on the airport, the domestic baggage reclaim area may be located next to or shared with the international reclaim area, or sometimes located in the public part of the airport alongside [[car rental]] desks and airport exits, and only passengers at their final destination claim their bags here. In most large airports in the [[United States]] and in some small ones as well, the domestic baggage reclaim is located on a different floor than the ticket counter, usually lower.

==Efficiency of baggage reclaim units==
The efficiency of baggage reclaim units can be measured in a number of ways including the amount of time a unit is in use for a given flight or the amount of baggage a unit can hold.&lt;ref name=Landrum&gt;{{cite book|title=Airport Passenger Terminal Planning and Design: Spreadsheet models and user's guide|year=2010|isbn=0-309-11816-6|pages=53–54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXS1mAY370YC&amp;dq=%22Baggage+claim%22+airport|author=Landrum &amp; Brown |publisher=Transportation Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of factors can independently affect the efficiency of a particular unit:&lt;ref name=Landrum /&gt;
*Aircraft seating capacity
*Proportion of passengers with checked luggage
*Proportion of passengers who are terminating at a given destination
*Average number of luggage pieces per passenger
*Average traveling party size
*Average number of people at baggage reclaim
*Average rate at which luggage are unloaded from the flight (this also depends on the physical properties of checked luggage)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8954">'''Bare Machine Computing''' ('''BMC''') is a programming paradigm based on [[bare machine]]s. In the BMC paradigm, applications run without the support of any [[operating system]] (OS) or centralized kernel i.e., no intermediary software is loaded on the bare machine prior to running applications. The applications, which are called bare machine applications or simply BMC applications, do not use any persistent storage or a hard disk, and instead are stored on detachable mass storage such as a USB flash drive. A BMC program consists of a single application or a small set of applications (application suite) that runs as a single executable within one address space. BMC applications have direct access to the necessary hardware resources. They are self-contained, self-managed and self-controlled entities that boot, load and run without using any other software components or external software. BMC applications have inherent security due to their design. There are no OS-related vulnerabilities, and each application only contains the necessary (minimal) functionality. There is no privileged mode in a BMC system since applications only run in user mode. Also, application code is statically compiled-there is no means to dynamically alter BMC program flow during execution.

== History == 
In the early days of computing, computer applications directly communicated to the hardware. As applications grew larger encompassing various domains, OSes were invented. They served as middleware providing hardware abstractions to applications. OSes have grown immensely in their size and complexity resulting in attempts to reduce OS overhead and improve performance including   [[Microkernel]], [[Exokernel]] , [[TinyOS|Tiny-OS]], OS-Kit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The OS Kit Project|publisher=School of Computing, University of Utah|location=Salt Lake, Utah|date=June 2002|url=http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palacio and Kitten &lt;ref&gt;J. Lange et al, “Palacios and Kitten: New high perfor-mance operating systems for scalable virtualized and native supercomputing,” 24th IEEEInternational Paral-lel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), 2010, pp. 1-12&lt;/ref&gt;,IO_Lite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=V.

In addition to the above approaches, in [[embedded systems]] such as smart phones, a small and dedicated portion of an OS and a given set of applications are closely integrated with the hardware. There are also a myriad of industrial control and gaming applications that run directly on the hardware. In most of these systems, the hardware is not open to run general purpose applications. 

Bare machine computing originated with application object (AO) concept invented by Karne at Towson University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R. K.|last=Karne|title=Object-Oriented Computer Architectures for New Generation of Applications, Computer Architecture News|date=December 1995|volume=23|issue=5|pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It evolved over the years into dispersed operating systems (DOSC),&lt;ref&gt;Karne, R.K, Venkatasamy, K, Ahmed, T. Dispersed Operating System Computing (DOSC), Onward Track, OOPSLA 2005, San Diego, CA, October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and  eventually into the BMC paradigm.

== Compared to conventional computing ==
In many ways, the BMC paradigm differs from conventional computing. There is no centralized kernel or OS running during the execution of BMC applications. Also, a bare machine in the BMC paradigm does not have any ownership or store valuable resources; and it can be used to run general purpose computing applications. Such characteristics are not found in conventional computing systems including embedded systems and    [[system on a chip]] (SOC). In addition, the BMC concept is a minimalistic approach to achieve simplicity, smaller code sizes and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=S.|last1=Soumya|first2=R.|last2=Guerin|first3=K.|last3=Hosanagar|title=Functionality-Rich vs. Minimalist Platforms: A Two-Sided Market Analysis|journal=ACM Computer Communication Review|volume=41|issue=5|pages=36–43|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS)''' is an integrated bill payment system in [[India]] offering interoperable and accessible bill payment service to customers through a network of agents of registered member as Agent Institutions (AI),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npci.org.in/bharat-billpay-live-members&lt;/ref&gt; enabling multiple payment modes, and providing instant confirmation of payment.&lt;ref name="RBI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=9368&amp;Mode=0 | title=Implementation of Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) - Guidelines | publisher=Reserve Bank of India | date=28 November 2014 | accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Payments Corporation of India]] (NPCI) functions as the authorised Bharat Bill Payment Central Unit (BBPCU), which will be responsible for setting business standards, rules and procedures for technical and business requirements for all the participants. NPCI, as the BBPCU, will also undertake clearing and settlement activities related to transactions routed through BBPS. Existing bill aggregators and banks are envisaged to work as Operating Units to provide an interoperable bill payment system irrespective of which unit has on-boarded a particular biller. Payments may be made through the BBPS using cash, transfer cheques, and electronic modes.&lt;ref name="NPCI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.npci.org.in/BBPS-about-us.aspx | title= NPCI - About Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) | publisher=National Payments Corporation of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Committee headed by RBI Executive Director G. Padmanabhan was set up in 2013 to study the feasibility of implementation of [[Giro]] based [[Payment Systems]]. It had estimated that over 30,800 million bills amounting to Rs.6223 billion are generated each year in the top 20 cities in the country.&lt;ref name="RBI"/&gt;

It was felt that integrated bill payment system is required in the country that could offer interoperable and accessible bill payment services to customers through a network of agents, allow multiple payment modes, and provide instant confirmation of payment. This should also serve as an efficient, cost-effective alternative to the existing systems and enhance consumer confidence and experience.

In [[fluid dynamics]], a '''blast wave''' is the increased pressure and flow resulting from the deposition of a large amount of energy in a small, very localised volume. The flow field can be approximated as a lead [[shock wave]], followed by a self-similar subsonic flow field. In simpler terms, a blast wave is an area of pressure expanding supersonically outward from an explosive core. It has a leading shock front of compressed gases. The blast wave is followed by a blast wind of [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]], which sucks items back in towards the center. The blast wave is harmful especially when one is very close to the center or at a location of constructive interference. High explosives that [[detonation|detonate]] generate blast waves.

==Sources==
High-order explosives (HE) are more powerful than low-order explosives (LE). HE [[Detonation|detonate]] to produce a defining supersonic over-pressurization shock wave. Several sources of HE include [[trinitrotoluene]], [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]], [[Semtex]], [[nitroglycerin]], and ammonium nitrate fuel oil ([[ANFO]]). LE [[Deflagration|deflagrate]] to create a subsonic explosion and lack HE’s over-pressurization wave. Sources of LE include pipe bombs, gunpowder, and most pure petroleum-based incendiary bombs such as Molotov cocktails or aircraft improvised as guided missiles. HE and LE induce different injury patterns. Only HE produce true blast waves.

==History==
The classic flow solution—the so-called "similarity solution"—was independently devised by [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, John von, "The point source solution," ''John von Neumann.

&lt;/ref&gt; during [[World War II]]. After the war, the similarity solution was published by three other authors—[[L. I. Sedov]],&lt;ref&gt;Sedov, L. I., "Propagation of strong shock waves,"  ''Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics'', Vol. 10, pages 241 - 250 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt; R.

I. Taylor'', [Cambridge, England:  Cambridge University Press, 1996], pages 202 - 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early theoretical work more than 50 years ago, both theoretical and experimental studies of blast waves have been ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey JM. 53 years of blast wave research, a personal history. 21st International Symposium on Military and Blast, Israel, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart EJ, et al.

==Characteristics and properties==
[[Image:Friedlander waveform.jpg|300px|left | thumb | A Friedlander waveform is the simplest form of a blast wave.]]

The simplest form of a blast wave has been described and termed the Friedlander waveform.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey JM. THE SHAPE OF THE BLAST WAVE: STUDIES OF THE FRIEDLANDER EQUATION. Presented at the 21st International Symposium on Military Aspects of Blast and Shock, Israel 2010 [http://www.blastanalysis.com/WordDocuments/MABS21/Dewey%20Presentation%20%2323.ppt read online]&lt;/ref&gt;  It occurs when a high explosive [[Detonation|detonates]] in a free field, that is, with no surfaces nearby with which it can interact.
Blast waves have properties predicted by the [[Wave#Physical properties|physics of waves]]. For example, they can [[Diffraction|diffract]] through a narrow opening, and [[Refraction|refract]] as they pass through materials. Like light or sound waves, when a blast wave reaches a boundary between two materials, part of it is transmitted, part of it is absorbed, and part of it is reflected. The [[Acoustic impedance|impedances]] of the two materials determine how much of each occurs.

The equation for a Friedlander waveform describes the pressure of the blast wave as a function of time:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=P_se^{-\frac{t}{t^*}}\left(1-\frac{t}{t^*}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

where P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the peak pressure and t* is the time at which the pressure first crosses the horizontal axis (before the negative phase).

Blast waves will wrap around objects and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Remmenikov AM. Modelling blast loads on buildings in complex city geometries. Computers and Structures, 2005, 83(27), 2197-2205. [http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1359&amp;context=engpapers&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22Analysis%20blast%20loads%20buildings.%22 read online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, persons or objects behind a large building are not necessarily protected from a blast that starts on the opposite side of the building. Scientists use sophisticated mathematical models to predict how objects will respond to a blast in order to design effective barriers and safer buildings.&lt;ref&gt;for example,Cullis IG. Blast waves and how they interact with structures. J.R. Army Med Corps 147:16-26, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mach stem formation===
[[Image:Mach effect sequence.svg|250px|right| thumb | A blast wave reflecting from a surface and forming a mach stem.]] Mach stem formation occurs when a blast wave reflects off the ground and the reflection catches up with the original shock front, therefore creating a high pressure zone that extends from the ground up to a certain point called the triple point at the edge of the blast wave. Anything in this area experiences peak pressures that can be several times higher than the peak pressure of the original shock front.

===Constructive and destructive interference===
[[Image:Constructive interference.svg|250px|left | thumb | An example of constructive interference.]] In physics, interference is the meeting of two correlated waves and either increasing or lowering the net amplitude, depending on whether it is constructive or destructive interference. If a crest of a wave meets a crest of another wave at the same point then the crests interfere constructively and the resultant crest wave amplitude is increased; forming a much more powerful wave than either of the beginning waves. Similarly two troughs make a trough of increased amplitude. If a crest of a wave meets a trough of another wave then they interfere destructively, and the overall amplitude is decreased; thus making a wave that is much smaller than either of the parent waves.

The formation of a mach stem is one example of constructive interference. Whenever a blast wave reflects off of a surface, such as a building wall or the inside of a vehicle, different reflected waves can interact with each other to cause an increase in pressure at a certain point (constructive interference) or a decrease (destructive interference). In this way the interaction of blast waves is similar to that of sound waves or water waves.

==Damage==

Blast waves cause damage by a combination of the significant compression of the air in front of the wave (forming a [[shock front]]) and the subsequent wind that follows.&lt;ref&gt;Neff M. A visual model for blast waves and fracture. Master's Thesis, University of Toronto, Canada, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A blast wave travels faster than the speed of sound and the passage of the shock wave usually lasts only a few milliseconds. Like other types of explosions, a blast wave can also cause damage to things and people by the blast wind, debris, and fires. The original explosion will send out fragments that travel very fast. Debris and sometimes even people can get swept up into a blast wave, causing more injuries such as penetrating wounds, impalement, broken bones, or even death. The blast wind is the area of low pressure that causes debris and fragments to actually rush back towards the original explosions. The blast wave can also cause fires or even secondary explosions by a combination of the high temperatures that result from detonation and the physical destruction of fuel-containing objects.

==Applications==

===Bombs===
In response to an inquiry from the British [[MAUD Committee]], G. I. Taylor estimated the amount of energy that would be released by the explosion of an atomic bomb in air.  He postulated that for an idealized point source of energy, the spatial distributions of the flow variables would have the same form during a given time interval, the variables differing only in scale.  (Thus the name of the "similarity solution.")  This hypothesis allowed the partial differential equations in terms of r (the radius of the blast wave) and t (time) to be transformed into an ordinary differential equation in terms of the similarity variable  &lt;math&gt;\frac{r^{5}\rho_{o}}{t^{2}E}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{o}&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the air and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the energy that's released by the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Discussion of similarity solutions, including G. I. Taylor's:
[[Buckingham Pi theorem]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derivation of G. I. Taylor's similarity solution:

http://www.deas.harvard.edu/brenner/taylor/physic_today/taylor.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This result allowed G. I. Taylor to estimate the yield of the first atomic explosion in New Mexico in 1945 using only photographs of the blast, which had been published in newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;  The yield of the explosion was determined by using the equation:  &lt;math&gt;E = \left(\frac{\rho_{o}}{t^2}\right)\left(\frac{r}{C}\right)^5&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless constant that is a function of the ratio of the specific heat of air at constant pressure to the specific heat of air at constant volume. The value of C is also affected by radiative losses, but for air, values of C of 1.00-1.10 generally give reasonable results. In 1950, G. I. Taylor published two articles in which he revealed the yield E of the first atomic explosion,&lt;ref name=taylor_1950/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor_1950a/&gt; which had previously been classified and whose publication therefore caused a great to-do.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

While nuclear explosions are among the clearest examples of the destructive power of blast waves, blast waves generated by exploding conventional bombs and other weapons made from high explosives have been used as weapons of war due to their effectiveness at creating polytraumatic injury.  During World War II and the U.S.’s involvement in the Vietnam War, [[blast lung]] was a common and often deadly injury.  Improvements in vehicular and personal protective equipment have helped to reduce the incidence of blast lung.  However, as soldiers are better protected from penetrating injury and surviving previously lethal exposures, limb injuries, eye and ear injuries, and traumatic brain injuries have become more prevalent.

===Effects of blast loads on buildings===
Structural behaviour during an explosion depends entirely on the materials used in the construction of the building. Upon hitting the face of a building, the shock front from an explosion is instantly reflected. This impact with the structure imparts momentum to exterior components of the building. The associated kinetic energy of the moving components must be absorbed or dissipated in order for them to survive. Generally, this is achieved by converting the kinetic energy of the moving component to strain energy in resisting elements.&lt;ref name="Dusenberry"&gt;Dusenberry, Donald. 'Handbook for Blast Resistant Design of Buildings', 2010, pages 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the resisting elements, such as windows, building facades and support columns fail, causing partial damage through to progressive collapse of the building.

===Astronomy ===
The so-called '''Sedov-Taylor''' solution {{see above|Bombs|mid=y}} has become useful in [[astrophysics]]. For example, it can be applied to quantify an estimate for the outcome from [[supernova]]-explosions. The Sedov-Taylor expansion is also known as the 'Blast Wave' phase, which is an adiabatic expansion phase in the life cycle of supernova. The temperature of the material in a supernova shell decreases with time, but the internal energy of the material is always 72% of E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the initial energy released. This is helpful for astrophysicists interested in predicting the behavior of supernova remnants.

===Research===

Blast waves are generated in research environments using explosive or compressed-gas driven [[shock tube]]s in an effort to replicate the environment of a military conflict to better understand the physics of blasts and injuries that may result, and to develop better protection against blast exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart, Dr. E. J., Henny, Dr. R. W., Thomsen, J. M., Duray, J. P.  DTRA Weapons Effects Testing: A Thirty Year Perspective. Applied Research and Associates, Shock Physics Division&lt;/ref&gt; Blast waves are directed against structures (such as vehicles),&lt;ref&gt;for example, Bauman, R. A., Ling, G., Tong, L., Januszkiewicz, A., Agoston, D., Delanerolle, N., Kim, Y., Ritzel, D., Bell, R., Ecklund, J., Armonda, R., Bandak, F., Parks, S. An Introductory Characterization of a Combat-Casualty-Care Relevant Swine Model of Closed Head Injury Resulting from Exposure to Explosive Blast. Journal of Neurotrauma, June 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; materials, and biological specimens&lt;ref&gt;Cernak, I. The importance of systematic response in the pathobiology of blast-induced Neurotrauma. Frontiers in Neurology December, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or surrogates.  High-speed [[pressure sensor]]s and/or [[high speed camera]]s are often used to quantify the response to blast exposure.  Anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs or [[crash test dummy|test dummies]]) initially developed for the automotive industry are being used, sometimes with added instrumentation, to estimate the human response to blast events.  For examples, personnel in vehicles and personnel on demining teams have been simulated using these ATDs.&lt;ref&gt;Makris, A. Nerenberg, J., Dionne, J. P., Bass, C. R., Chichester. Reduction of Blast Induced Head Acceleration in the Field of Anti-Personnel Mine Clearance. Med-Eng Systems Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with experiments, complex mathematical models have been made of the interaction of blast waves with inanimate and biological structures.&lt;ref&gt;for example, Stuhmiller JH. Mathematical Modeling in Support of Military Operational Medicine Final Report J3150.01-06-306 prepared for the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Fort Detrick, Maryland 21702-5012 OMB No. 0704-0188, July, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Validated models are useful for "what if" experiments – predictions of outcomes for different scenarios.  Depending on the system being modeled, it can be difficult to have accurate input parameters (for example, the material properties of a rate-sensitive material at blast rates of loading).  Lack of experimental validation severely limits the usefulness of any numerical model.

'''Data Discovery and Query Builder''' (DDQB) is a data abstraction technology, developed by [[IBM]], that allows users to retrieve information from a data warehouse, in terms of the user's specific area of expertise instead of SQL.

DDQB serves the user through a web based graphical user interface and configurable data abstraction model (DAM), which contains both an understanding of the user knowledge domain and the database below it.

DDQB uses a set of [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]-based customization tooling and can be deployed as a set of [[Web Services]].

[[Image:Anaerobic digestate.JPG|right|thumbnail|300px|Acidogenic digestate produced from mixed [[municipal waste]] ]]
'''Digestate''' is the material remaining after the anaerobic digestion of a [[biodegradable]] feedstock. [[Anaerobic digestion]] produces two main products: digestate and [[biogas]]. Digestate is produced both by [[acidogenesis]] and [[methanogenesis]] and each has different characteristics.

== Acidogenic digestate ==

Acidogenic digestate is fibrous and consists of structural plant matter including [[lignin]] and [[cellulose]]. Acidogenic digestate has high moisture retention properties. The digestate may also contain [[minerals]] and remnants of [[bacteria]].

== Methanogenic digestate ==

Methanogenic digestate is a sludge (sometimes called a liquor). This is often high in nutrients such as [[ammonium]]s and [[phosphate]]s.

==Uses==

The primary use of digestate is as a [[soil conditioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 Evaluation of Opportunities for Converting Indigenous UK Wastes to Fuels and Energy (Report), NNFCC 09-012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181907/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acidogenic digestate provides [[moisture retention]] and organic content for soils. This organic material can break down further, aerobically in [[soil]]. Methanogenic digestate provides nutrients for [[plant]] growth. It can also be used to protect soils against erosion.

Acidogenic digestate can also be used as an [[environmentally friendly]] filler to give structure to [[Plastic compounding|composite plastics]].

Growth trials on digestate originating from mixed waste have showed healthy growth results for crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexmarshall.me.uk/index_files/documents/ResponsetoConsultationonthesourcesegregationrequirementinParagraph7AofSchedule3totheWasteMan.pdf Response to source segregation requirement], www.alexmarshall.me.uk, Retrieved 22.02.07&lt;/ref&gt; Digestate can also be used in intensive greenhouse cultivation of plants, e.g. in [[Digeponics]].

Application of digestate has been shown to inhibit plant diseases and induction of resistance. Digestate application has a direct effect on soil-born diseases, and an indirect effect by stimulation of biological activity.

==Digestate and compost==
Digestate is technically not [[compost]] although it is similar to it in physical and chemical characteristics. Compost is produced by [[aerobic digestion]]- [[Aerobic decomposition|decomposition by aerobes]]. This includes [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] which are able to break down the lignin and cellulose to a greater extent.

==Standards for digestate==
The standard of digestate produced by anaerobic digestion can be assessed on three criteria, chemical, biological and physical aspects. Chemical quality needs to be considered in terms of heavy metals and other inorganic contaminant, persistent organic compounds and the content of macro-elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Depending on their source, biowastes can contain pathogens, which can lead to the spreading of human, animal or plant diseases if not appropriately managed. 

The physical standards of composts includes mainly appearance and odour factors. Whilst physical contamination does not present a problem with regards to human, plant or animal health, contamination (in the form of plastics, metals and ceramics) can cause a negative public perception. Even if the compost is of high quality and all standards are met, a negative public perception of waste-based composts still exists. The presence of visible contaminants reminds users of this.

Quality control of the feedstock is the most important way of ensuring a quality end product. The content and quality of waste arriving on-site should be characterised as thoroughly as possible prior to being supplied.

In the UK the [[Publicly Available Specification]] (called PAS110) governs the definition of digestate derived from the anaerobic digestion of source-segregated biodegradable materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrap.org.uk/ad WRAP Anaerobic Digestion Page]&lt;/ref&gt; The specification ensures all digested materials are of consistent quality and fit for purpose. If a biogas plant meets the standard, its digestate will be regarded as having been fully recovered and to have ceased to be waste, and it can be sold with the name “Bio- fertiliser”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biogas-info.co.uk/index.php/standards-agri.html UK's Official Information Portal on Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas, Digestate Standards Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gluehlampe 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|upright|230-[[volt]] [[incandescent light bulb]] with E27 screw base]]

'''Edison screw''' ('''ES''') is a standard [[lightbulb socket]] for [[electric light]] bulbs in North America. It was developed by [[Thomas Edison]] and was licensed in 1909 under General Electric's [[Mazda (light bulb)|Mazda]] trademark. The bulbs have [[Screw thread#Handedness|right-hand threaded]] metal bases (caps) which screw into matching threaded sockets (lamp holders). For bulbs powered by [[Single-phase electric power|AC current]], the thread is generally connected to [[Ground and neutral|neutral]] and the contact on the bottom tip of the base is connected to the "live" phase.

In North America and continental Europe, Edison screws displaced other socket types for general lighting.  In the early days of electrification, Edison screws were the only standard connector, and appliances other than light bulbs were connected to AC power via lamp sockets. Today Edison screw sockets comply with international standards.{{Citation needed|reason=which standards?|date=November 2017}}

== History ==
Early US incandescent lamp manufacturers used several different and incompatible bases. The [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] used a threaded stud at the bottom of the socket, and a flat contact ring. The Sawyer-Mann or [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] base used a spring clip acting on grooves in the bulb base, and a contact stud at the bottom of the lamp. By about 1908, the Edison base was most common in the US, with the others falling out of use.&lt;ref&gt;I.C.S. Reference Library volume 4B, [[International Textbook Company]], Scranton PA 1908, page 43-41&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Edison's [[patent]], [[Reginald Fessenden]] invented the [[Bi-pin lamp base|bi-pin connector]] for the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 World's Fair]]. Other lamp bases include the [[bayonet mount]] and [[wedge base]].

== Types ==
[[File:Light bulb socket E26 three way.jpg|thumb|upright|Three-way E26d light socket]]
[[File:Light socket plug adapter.jpg|thumb|upright|E26 Edison screw to [[NEMA connector|NEMA 1-15]] adapter]]

Specifications for all lamp mount types are defined in the following [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) publications:

* Lamp Caps—ANSI C81.61 and IEC 60061-1 
* Lamp Holders—NSI C81.62 and IEC 60061-2
* Gauges (to ensure interchangeability)—ANSI C81.63 and IEC 60061-3
* Guidelines for Electrical Lamp Bases, Lampholders and Gauges—ANSI C81.64 and IEC 60061-4

Generally, the two standards are harmonized, although several types of screw mount are still defined in only one standard.

In the designation "Exx", "E" stands for "Edison" and "xx" indicates the [[diameter]] in millimeters as measured across the peaks of the thread on the base (male), e.g., E12 has a diameter of 12&amp;nbsp;mm.  This is distinct from the glass envelope (bulb)  diameter, which in the U.S. is given in eighths of an inch, e.g., A19, [[Multifaceted reflector|MR16]], T12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lightopedia.com/lamp-size-reference |title=Lamp Size Reference |publisher=lightopedia.com |access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four commonly used thread size groups for mains supply lamps:

# Candelabra: E12 North America, E11 in Europe
# Intermediate: E17 North America, E14 (Small ES, SES) in Europe
# Medium or standard: E26 (MES) in North America, E27 (ES) in Europe
# Mogul: E39 North America, E40 (Goliath ES) in Europe.

The E26 and E27 are usually interchangeable, as are the E39 and E40, because there is only a 1&amp;nbsp;mm difference in thread outside diameter. E11 and E12 are not interchangeable. Other semi-standard screw thread sizes are available for certain specific applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bulbs.com/learning/shapesandsizes.aspx |title=Light Bulb Shape and Size Chart {{!}} Reference Charts |publisher=Bulbs.com |access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large E39 "Mogul" and E40 "Goliath" base are used on [[street light]]s, and high-wattage lamps (such as a 100-/200-/300-watt three-way) and many [[High-intensity discharge lamp|high-intensity discharge lamps]]. In areas following the U.S. [[National Electrical Code]], general-use lamps over 300&amp;nbsp;W cannot use an E26 base and must instead use the E39 base; 300&amp;nbsp;W lamps may use either base.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Medium Edison screw (MES) bulbs for 12&amp;nbsp;V are also produced for [[recreational vehicle]]s. Large outdoor Christmas lights use Intermediate base, as do some desk lamps and many [[microwave oven]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Previously, [[emergency exit]] signs also tended to use the intermediate base,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} but U.S. and Canadian rules now require long-life and energy-efficient [[LED lamp]]s, which can be purchased inside a conventional Edison base bulb as a [[Retrofitting|retrofit]]. A medium screw base should not carry more than 25 [[ampere]]s current; this may limit the practical rating of [[low voltage]] lamps.&lt;ref&gt;General Electric ''Incandescent Lamps'' manual, publication no. TP 110, 1976, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

E29 "Admedium" bases are used for special applications, for example UV spotlight lamps in magnetic crack detection machines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In countries that use 220–240 volt [[alternating current|AC]] [[Mains electricity|domestic power]], standard-size E27 and small E14 are the most common screw-mount sizes and are prevalent throughout continental Europe{{efn|The BC or [[bayonet mount]] fitting is the most common light bulb fitting in the UK and many British Commonwealth countries, and is found in older installations{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} in some other countries, including France and Greece.}} and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=灯泡螺口规格、灯泡的选购技巧 |url=http://home.fang.com/zhishi/17875538.htm |website=搜房网家居装修|access-date=28 February 2017|language=zh|quote=最长[常]{{sic}}的使用的螺口灯泡规格是：E14和E27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 120-volt [[North America]], 100-volt [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]], the standard size for general-purpose lamps is E26.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ledwaves.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions "The E26 is the standard 120 Volt American base."] LED waves, FAQ, retrieved 5 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharp.co.jp/support/advice/led_lighting/select_c1.html "E26: 一般電球、ボール電球の多くがこのサイズ。"] Sharp Japan, support pages, retrieved on 30 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

E12 is typically used for candelabra fixtures. E17 is also sometimes used, especially in small [[Light fixture|table lamps]] and novelty lighting, and occasionally the lights on newer [[ceiling fan]]s. [[Christmas lights]] use various base sizes E17 for C9 bulbs, E12 for C7 bulbs, E10 for decades-old [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series-wired]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20061020231535/http://www.oldchristmaslights.com/lamp_evolution.htm C6 bulb sets] in the U.S., and an entirely different [[wedge base]] for T1¾ mini lights. For a short time early on, these mini lights were manufactured using E5 screw bases.

A tiny E5 or E5.5 size is used only for [[extra-low voltage]]s, such as in interior [[lighting|illumination]] for [[model building]]s, and model [[vehicle]]s such as [[Rail transport modelling|model train]]s. These are often called "[[pea]] bulbs" if they are globe-shaped, but they commonly look like mini Christmas bulbs, or large "grain-of-[[wheat]]" bulbs. E10 bulbs are common on [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered [[flashlight]]s, as are bayonet mounts (although those are usually held in with a circular [[flange]] located where the base meets the glass envelope of the bulb). The E11 base is sometimes used for 50/75/100-watt halogen lights in North America, where it is called the "mini-can", and tighter threads are used to keep them out of E12-base [[nightlight]]s and other places where they could start a fire.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

There are also adapters between screw sizes, and for adapting to or from bayonet caps. A socket extender makes the bulb stick out further, such as to accommodate a [[compact fluorescent lamp]] that doesn't fit in a [[Recessed light|recessed lighting]] fixture.

Most Edison screws have right-hand threads (lamp is turned [[clockwise]] to tighten), but left-hand threaded screws are sometimes used, usually for a non-standard voltage or wattage bulb. This prevents the use of an incorrect bulb, which could cause damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lightbulbs.com/blog/left-handed-incandescent-light-bulbs |title=Left Handed Incandescent Light Bulbs?|last=|first=|date=March 24, 2011 |publisher=eLightBulbs |access-date=|last1=Eisenbraun|first1=Blair|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public locations such as railway trains and the [[New York City Subway]] have used light bulbs with left-hand threads to discourage theft of the bulbs for use in regular light fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McManus |first=Chris |title=Right Hand, Left Hand: The Origins of Asymmetry in Brains, Bodies, Atoms and Cultures |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=2004 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20oza63ZuG4C&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=left%20handed%20light%20bulbs&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=left%20handed%20light%20bulbs&amp;f=false |accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World |last=Schneier |first=Bruce |author-link=Bruce Schneier |page=221 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EALEaiVhmjoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Schneier%20Beyond%20Fear&amp;pg=PA221#v=onepage&amp;q=light%20bulbs&amp;f=false |accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:D12cord.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1909 toaster with Edison plug]]

The Edison screw socket was used as an outlet (such as for [[toaster]]s) when [[mains electricity]] was still mainly used for [[lighting]], and before wall outlets became common.

In North America, [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] were used in buildings wired before 1960. These [[Fuse (electrical)#North America|Edison base fuses]] would screw into a fuse socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps.

Some adapters for [[AC power plugs and sockets|wall outlet]]s use an Edison screw, allowing a light socket to become an ungrounded electrical outlet (such as to install Christmas lights temporarily via a [[porch]] light), or to make a [[Pullstring|pull-chain]] switch with two outlets, or to split it for two lamps. Another adapter can make a wall outlet into a lamp holder (lamp socket).

Various other accessories have been made, including a [[smoke detector]] that [[Rechargeable battery|recharges]] over a few hours and lasts for a few days or weeks thereafter, and still allows the attached lamp to operate normally. There have also been electronics that stick onto the end of the screw base and allow the attached lamp to flash, for example, to attract the attention of arriving guests or [[emergency vehicle]]s; others function as a [[dimmer]] or [[timer]], or dim gradually in a child's [[bedroom]] in the evening.

Some thermionic valves [[vacuum tube]]s, such as certain rectifiers, use an Edison screw base.

Three-way lamps have a ''d'' suffix to indicate double contacts, usually E26d or E27d, or rarely E39d. The second contact is used for the lower-wattage filament of the two inside the lamp. This extra contact is a ring located around the main contact. Unlike bayonet sockets, three-way and regular lamps are interchangeable, although the low filament or low setting doesn’t work if mismatched.

The small Edison screw has nine threads per inch, or about 2.8 mm per thread.

The medium Edison screw has seven threads per inch, or about 3.6 mm per thread. In the U.S., the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] requirement for greater [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] only applies to the medium Edison screw, all other being considered "specialty" lamps.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

[[IEC 60269#D-system (DIAZED)|Diazed fuses]] DII uses the same E27 thread as standard 230&amp;nbsp;V lamps, but have a longer body and cannot be screwed into a lamp holder (socket). A lamp base is too short to contact the bottom terminal of a fuse holder.  However it's possible (but not useful) to screw a DII fuse holder without a fuse in an E27 lamp holder.

Screw bases have a number of disadvantages compared to the bayonet fit type:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}{{original research inline|date=April 2016}}
* The metal screw itself forms one of the contacts for the circuit. If the lighting system is not correctly wired, or a lamp is plugged into a non-polarized outlet, the metal screw can become live, presenting an [[Electrical injury|electric shock]] hazard to anyone attempting to change the lamp.
* It is possible to over-tighten the screw, risking breaking the bulb or separation of the glass envelope from the metal base and leaving the base in the socket, especially when subsequently attempting to unscrew it.
* If the lamp becomes loose in the socket due to vibration or under-tightening, it can lose contact with the center contact and stop working until it is tightened. The bayonet type is resistant to vibration and much less likely to become loose.
* As the metal thread carries current, any arcing can jam the thread.
* Corrosion is more likely to jam a screw thread than a bayonet fixing.
* Screwing in and unscrewing the bulb places more force on the glass envelope.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* When fixing anything with a cable attached, the cable will twist as the screw is turned.


Screw bases have a number of advantages compared to the bayonet fit type:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}{{original research inline|date=April 2016}}
* Screw bases are more suitable for small size bulbs
* A bulb fully screwed home is more secure than a bayonet fit bulb
* Moisture and debris are less likely to contaminate the contacts of a screw base bulb
* Spring contacts are not necessary on screw base bulbs (the spring tension must not only ensure a good contact but it must also hold the bulb securely in the bayonet so there is a compromise)

{{Citations missing|date=August 2007}}
The '''fire screen desk''' (also known as a '''screen writing table''') is  a very small [[antique]] desk form meant to be placed in front of a [[fireplace]] to keep a user's feet warm while he or she is stationary while writing. This kind of [[desk]] was very popular in prosperous homes in Europe during the 18th century and slowly disappeared during the 19th, with the gradual introduction of [[stove]]s and [[central heating]]. 

In order to keep the feet and the calves exposed to the heat from the fire, the fire screen desk usually had the form of a miniature [[writing table]] or a tiny [[bureau à gradin]], with just a few drawers beneath the desktop.  As its name indicates, it had a retractable fire screen in the back to protect the user's relatively exposed face from too much heat from the fireplace.  The screen was usually made of a pleated or straight piece of heavy fabric, supported by crossed and sliding metallic supports.  Many fire screen desks still exist, but the original screens have rarely survived.  The metal supports or rods which extended the screens generally have been maintained with the desk.  When the bare rods are in their extended position, they form an 'X shape' above the back of the desk.

A few fire screen desks had no screen per se but were simply lighter, narrower, and extremely thinner versions of the high [[secretary desk]] put on some form of permanent trestle mount.  Their high form shielded the user's face from the heat of the flames while the open trestle mount at the bottom exposed the feet.  They were basically a smaller version of a French form called [[Secretaire en portefeuille]].

The fire screen desk was often designed for use by a person of a specific gender:  those designed for use by a female frequently had complex ornamentation and were generally smaller (light enough to be transported easily by a lady's maid) than those designed for use by a male. Because of these differences, individual desks were frequently called a ''gentleman's screen writing table'' or a ''lady's screen writing table''.

'''Flexicoil suspension''' is a wear-resistant and maintenance-free [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system, used in railway vehicles. It is a secondary suspension, installed between the body and the [[bogie]] of the [[locomotive]], [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger car]] or [[Goods wagon|wagon]] so fitted.

This type of suspension is most commonly used in modern rail passenger cars when [[air suspension]] is not required, since it is cheaper to buy and to maintain than air suspension.

== History ==
The word "Flexicoil" was coined by [[General Motors]]' [[Electro Motive Division]], to describe a suspension system fitted to some of the [[diesel locomotive]]s in its range.  As early as the 1930s, flexicoil suspensions were being used in locomotives in [[Spain]], the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;

Flexicoil suspension technology in high speed [[electric locomotive]]s was pioneered in [[Germany]] in the 1950s and 1960s, in various [[Deutsche Bundesbahn|DB]] [[standard electric locomotive]]s, and especially the [[DB Class 103]].&lt;ref name="Duffy"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Duffy | first1 = Michael C | last2 =  | first2 = | title = Electric railways 1880-1990 | volume =  | publisher = Institution of Electrical Engineers | year = 2003 | location = London | isbn = 978-0-85296-805-5 | pages = 335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1969 and 1971, [[British Rail]] conducted trials of a flexicoil suspension system in a [[British Rail Class 86]] locomotive, no E 3173,&lt;ref name="AC Loco"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aclocogroup.co.uk/history86.php |title= Class History - AL6 / 86 |author= |date= |work= The AC Locomotive Group's website |publisher= The AC Locomotive Group |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Testing"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.traintesting.com/high_speed_testing.htm |title= High speed testing on WCML in the 70's |author= |date= |work= Testing Times |publisher= |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was affectionately nicknamed "Zebedee", after the [[jack-in-the-box]] character in the BBC television series ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]''.&lt;ref name="Testing"/&gt;  These experiments were successful, and led initially to the rebuilding of 56 members of the class with flexicoil suspension, as class 86/2.&lt;ref name="Duffy" /&gt;   Ultimately, all members of class 86 were fitted with flexicoil suspensions.&lt;ref name="AC Loco" /&gt;

== Technical details ==
[[File:380 019 bogie2.JPG|thumbnail|right|Flexicoil springs at ČD Class 380 standing in a sharp curve ]]
The [[spring (device)|springs]] in a flexicoil suspension are made of steel.  Protruding from above and below, and into, each spring is a spherical rubber dome that can absorb some of the horizontal forces. These domes are connected firmly to either the vehicle body (above) or the bogie frame (below). Under this arrangement, each flexicoil spring is twisted and moved from its vertical axis when the vehicle is cornering. This helps the two bogies to align themselves equally underneath the vehicle body. The vertical forces are absorbed entirely by the steel springs.

As the springs have relatively soft characteristics, hydraulic vertical dampers must also be installed for vibration damping at higher speeds than {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}}, along with longitudinal dampers.  Lateral damping is not normally required.

In railway passenger cars fitted with flexicoil suspension, the springs are the only mechanical connection between the bogie and the car body.  In heavier types of flexicoil suspension rolling stock, a bogie pivot fitted with rubber-metal bearings is used to hold a cross anchor yoke, which transfers the forces to the bogie frame via two cross anchor link pins.

Locomotive bogies are usually also provided with a [[:de:Tiefanlenkung|weight transfer linkage]], or with a different tension transmission.

'''Herodian architecture''' is a style of [[classical architecture]] characteristic of the numerous building projects undertaken during the reign (37–4 BC) of [[Herod the Great]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[client king]] of [[Iudaea Province#The client kingdom of Judea|Judea]]. Herod undertook many colossal building projects, most famously his [[Herod's Temple|reconstruction]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] (c. 19 BC). Many of his structures were built upon comparable, previous [[Hasmonean]] buildings and most of his have, in their turn, vanished as well.

==Innovations==
Herod introduced numerous architectural innovations and construction techniques in his buildings, such as the domes inside the [[Huldah Gates|Double Gate]] to the [[Temple Mount]]. He adapted the ''[[mikveh]]'' — a Jewish ritual bath — for use as the [[frigidarium]] in the Roman-style bathhouses in his many palaces. Herod also developed an innovative combination of palace and fortress; examples include the [[Antonia Fortress]] in Jerusalem, the [[Herodium]] in the [[Judean Desert]] about 2 miles south of [[Bethlehem]], and [[Masada]]. Characteristically, they have (or had) one tower higher and stronger than the others. Herod’s fortification innovations strongly influenced the military architecture of subsequent generations.

In line with contemporary Jewish customs, Herod generally avoided the representation of human and animal figures, even in the closed and private parts of his palaces.&lt;ref&gt;A few exceptions are recorded. [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Herod's Palace]] reportedly had bronze figures (probably animals) through which water was dispensed. (Levine, p. 200 cf. [[Josephus]], [[The Jewish War|War.]] 5.4) More notably, near the end of his reign, Herod erected a golden eagle above the gate of the Temple. The outrage this caused within the city was demonstrated when several youths removed and destroyed the eagle. They were subsequently executed. (Levine, p. 180 cf. Josephus, [[Antiquities of the Jews|Ant.]] 17.6)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herod's Temple==
{{main article|Herod's Temple}}
In the eighteenth year of his reign (20–19 BC), Herod rebuilt the [[Second Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] on "a more magnificent scale".&lt;ref name=temple&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=123&amp;letter=T&amp;search=Herod's%20Temple Temple of Herod], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The new Temple was finished in a year and a half, although work on out-buildings and courts continued another eighty years. To comply with religious law, Herod employed a thousand priests as masons and carpenters for the rebuilding. The finished temple, which was destroyed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 70 AD, is often referred to as [[Herod's Temple]]. [[The Wailing Wall]] (Western Wall) in Jerusalem was for many years the only section visible of the four retaining walls whose construction was begun by Herod to create a flat platform (the [[Temple Mount]]) upon which his Temple was constructed. Recent findings suggest that the Temple Mount walls and [[Robinson's Arch]] may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death during the reign of [[Herod Agrippa II]].&lt;ref name=Western&gt;{{cite web|title=Building the Western Wall: Herod Began it but Didn’t Finish it (december 2011)|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/Article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1882&amp;hist=1|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herod's palace-fortresses==
Herod constructed several lavish palace-fortresses within his kingdom, most notably at [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem]], [[Herod's Palace (Herodium)|Herodium]], [[Masada]], and [[Caesarea Maritima]].

==Herodian masonry==
[[File:Nidbach Raba IMG 2681.JPG|thumb|180px|left|Detail of the distinctive pattern of Herodian stone-dressing as seen in the [[Western Wall Tunnel]].]]

Herod’s massive building projects featured a distinctive style of [[stone-dressing]]. This stone-dressing method — usually featuring the pale local ''[[meleke]]'' limestone — was so prominently practiced in Herod's day that it has led to such terms as “Herodian blocks”, “Herodian masonry”, “Herodian dressing”, and the like. It makes Herodian stones easily discernible from the earlier stone courses below, and later ones above, in the surviving walls at many sites. Best known is the example of the impressive retaining walls of the Temple Mount, readily visible at the [[Western Wall]].

Enormous quantities of stone were needed for these structures and the remains of the numerous quarries used can still be found, especially in the vicinity of Jerusalem’s Old City, notably those to the north known as [[Solomon's Quarries]]. Freeing the stones from the bedrock was an elaborate process: Wide grooves were chiseled with metal tools around the intended stone block. The block was then freed up by driving metal wedges into the grooves. The initial dressing of the stone was probably accomplished on site before transport. Many of these stones were very large, weighing between two and five tons. (The [[Western Stone|largest found]], in the [[Western Wall Tunnel]], measures some 12.8 meters in length, 3.4 meters high and 4.3 meters deep; it weighs about 660 tons.) Once moved to the building site,  further fine chiseling was done and the blocks were hauled into place using ramps, cranes and crow bars. The stones were laid in dry courses, typically about 1 meter high without the use of any mortar. Each course was set 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;cm back from the course underneath it. Final dressing and refinements were carried out once the stones had been set in place.

The huge rectangular building blocks, laid in horizontal courses, feature flat, projecting central portions ([[Boss (architecture)|boss]]es) surrounded by narrow, shallow dressed margins (“marginal drafts”) creating a finely chiseled, frame-like effect. The depressed “frame” is sunk some 2 centimeters below the smooth face of the stone and its average width is about 8 centimeters. A wide, toothed chisel was used to smooth the stone margins.

The origins of this margin-cutting style predate Herod, as witnessed by the [[Hellenistic architecture]] of [[Alexandria]], [[Asia Minor]], and [[Greece]] itself, as well as by examples in the [[Levant]] (e.g., the palace of the Sons of Tuvia at [[Iraq]], el-Amir in [[Jordan]] (near [[Amman]]), dating from at least the 3rd century BC). Examples of pre-Herodian margin stone-cutting are also attested in Jerusalem itself: at the “[[Tower of David]]” (the Paza’el Tower), in the "[[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period#Hasmonean Kingdom|First city wall]]" and in the [[Israelite Tower|Hasmonean Tower]] unearthed in the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]]. Authentic “Herodian masonry” includes examples at the sites at [[Hebron]] (Elonei Mamre,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visitpalestine.ps/mamre-archaeological-site-in-the-middle-of-hebron/|title=Mamre: Archaeological Site in the Middle of Hebron - VisitPalestine|date=2015-10-10|website=VisitPalestine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cave of Machpelah]]), in the [[Augusteum]] in [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]] and possibly also in the Herodian platform at [[Caesarea Maritima]]. In Jerusalem, in addition to the [[Temple Mount]], Herodian stones are preserved beneath the [[Damascus Gate]]. It has been observed that this distinctive stone-dressing style serves as a decorative theme on Second Temple period [[ossuaries]] found in the Jerusalem area.

'''Hiking equipment''' is the equipment taken on outdoor walking trips. [[Hiking]] is usually divided into day-hikes and multiple-day hikes, called  [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], trekking, and [[walking tour]]s.

The equipment selected varies according to the duration, distance, planned activities, and the environment. Additional factors include weight and preparedness for unplanned events. The level of preparedness can relate to remoteness and potential hazards; for example, a short day hike across farmland or [[trekking]] in the [[Himalayas]]. The length and duration of a walk can influence the amount of weight carried.

The nature of a hike is both by the [[natural environment]] and the applicable [[government]] regulations and hikers plan accordingly when considering equipment.&lt;ref name="98.6 Degrees"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Cody |last1=Lundin |title=98.6 Degrees: The Art of Keeping Your Ass Alive |date=June 23, 2003 |publisher=Gibbs Smith |ISBN=978-1586852344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To minimize the impact on the natural environment, many hikers follow the principles of "[[Leave No Trace]]".

According to [[Tom Brown, Jr.|Tom Brown]], the basic plan for [[Survival skills|survival]]  is in the order of shelter (including clothing), water, fire, and food.&lt;ref name=TomsFieldGuide&gt;{{cite book |first1=Tom |last1=Brown |title=Tom Brown's Field Guide to Wilderness Survival |date=April 15, 1987 |publisher=Berkley Trade |ISBN=978-0425105726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RSOG Shelter"&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Rescue &amp; Special Operations, Shelter |publisher=USRSOG.org |url= http://www.usrsog.org/shel.htm |date=2007 |accessdate = 2014-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cody Lundin]] writes about the "Rule of 3s"; this relates to human survival without basics: three minutes without air, three hours without shelter, three days without water, or three weeks without food.&lt;ref name="98.6 Degrees"/&gt;

[[File:Bowie knife 1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[James Bowie|stout knife]] example, this blade is {{convert|9.25|in|cm|}} by {{convert|1.5|in|cm}}.]]

Hikers may take with them equipment ranging from a [[butcher knife|stout knife]]&lt;ref name=TomsFieldGuide /&gt; to [[ultralight backpacking]] (10–25 pounds),&lt;ref name="jardine"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Beyond Backpacking: Ray Jardines Guide to Lightweight Hiking | author=[[Ray Jardine]] | isbn=0-9632359-3-1 | year=1999|publisher=AventureLore Press|location=LaPine, OR }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jordan"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Lightweight Backpacking and Camping|author1=George Cole|author2=Ryan Jordan|author3=Alan Dixon|isbn=0-9748188-2-8|year=2006|publisher=Beartooth Mountain Press|location=Bozeman, MT }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the heaviest, most durable gear a hiker can carry.

Considerations for choice of hiking equipment may include:

* Length and remoteness of trip
* Optimal weight and capacity
* Special medical considerations
* Weather: temperature range, sun/shade, rain, snow, ice
* Terrain: trail conditions, cliffs, sand, swamp, river crossings
* Shelter and clothes
* Water plan
* Food
* Overnight shelter
* Protection from animals: insect repellent, [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic medication]], [[snakebite| snakebite first-aid]], [[antivenom]], [[Mace (spray)|mace]], [[bear spray]], [[bear-resistant food storage container]]
* Equipment for special activities

==Carrying methods and capacity==
[[File:CKc Pen Knife.jpg|thumb|A smaller knife that may be worn on a neck-lanyard]]
[[File:Leatherman Wave 060407 115706.jpg|thumb|A heavier [[multi-tool]] may be belt-carried.]]

A pack's capacity to carry items is determined by:
* Carrying methods on the body
* Bag volume
* Construction strength, design, materials, and construction quality

Commonly-used carrying methods include:
* A wristband, belt loop, a thin neck lanyard, and clothing pockets are among the smaller, lighter methods. 
* A small belt pouch (60 cu.in., 1 liter) that can attach to a belt 
* A bodypack or tactical vest (100–200 cu.in.) is a load-bearing vest, and may be as simple as a [[fishing vest]].
* A single-shoulder pack (500–800 cu.in., 8-14L) uses one shoulder strap, such as a [[haversack]],  [[messenger bag]], or [[sling bag]]. 
* A [[waistpack]] can range in size from a belt pouch to a haversack (1-14L); in the larger sizes, shoulder straps maybe provided. Waistpacks may be carried over a shoulder.
* Day packs (1,000–2,000 cu.in., 17-34L) are small to mid-sized backpacks that have two shoulder straps, smaller ones may not include a waist belt.
* A harness system may include a small backpack, a waistpack, a vest, and several belt pouches.
* Larger cargo backpacks (6,000 cu.in, 100+L) that have substantial, well-padded shoulder straps and a waist belt; some of these are designed to carry a couple hundred pounds.&lt;ref name="bullpacs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bull-pacs Specifications |publisher= BullPacs.com |url =http://www.Bullpacs.com/specs.html |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hikers divide their backpack into sections associated with specific needs, i.e. kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, etc., or by clothes, shelter, water, fire, and food.&lt;ref name=RSOGEquip&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Rescue &amp; Special Operations, Survival Kits |publisher=USRSOG.org |url= http://www.usrsog.org/equip.htm |date=2007 |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Military and law-enforcement personnel use a variety of modular and attachment systems, like [[duty belt]]s, [[Personal Load Carrying Equipment|tactical vests]], [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment]], [[MOLLE]], [[Improved Load Bearing Equipment]], [[FILBE]], and [[Personal Load Carrying Equipment|PLCE]]. Military surplus outlets are optional sources for backpacking equipment.

Construction quality may be determined by design, manufacturer reputation, advertised purpose, and field testing. Customer reviews are often posted online.&lt;ref name="backpackgeartest"&gt;{{cite web |title=Backpack Gear Test |publisher =BackPackGearTest.org |url= http://www.backpackgeartest.org/reviews/Packs/ |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy pack fabrics are made from 800–1000 [[Denier (unit)|denier]] nylon material.

A large, heavy pack of {{Convert|100|liters|cuin}} weighs {{Convert|100|lbs|kg}}, and {{Convert|1|liter|USgal}} of water weighs {{Convert|1|kg|lbs}}. The best-made packs may carry up to twice their weight in water; less well-made packs may only carry half their weight in water. The British army bergen backpack, which has a capacity of {{Convert|120|liters|cuin}} carrying up to {{Convert|90|kg|lbs}} is made from 1000 denier nylon. Backpacks carrying more than {{convert|30|lb|kg|}} usually have waist-belts to help with posture by transferring the weight to the hips. Some experts recommend keeping the equipment's total weight to less than 25% of the hiker's weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How heavy should your pack be?|url=http://www.bushwalkingholidays.com.au/howheavy.shtml |website=BushWalkingHolidays.com |publisher=Willie's Walkabouts, Millner NT, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ideal Backpack Weight|url=http://www.getoutzine.com/node/349 |website=GetOutZine.com|publisher=Jeff Alt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Pack a Backpack: Learn how to correctly load your pack for your next outing |url=http://www.wildbackpacker.com/backpacking-gear/backpacks/how-to-pack-a-backpack |website=WildBackpacker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apparel==
{{Main|Hiking apparel}}

Apparel, including [[clothing]], shoes, hats, etc., provides insulation from heat, cold, water or fire. It shades the body and protects it from injury from thorns and insect bites.

Basic outdoor clothing materials are goose down, wool, polyester, and polyolefin, which provide similar degrees of insulation when dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1 =W.C. |last1 =Kaufam  |first2 =D. |last2 =Bothe  |first3 =S.D. |last3 =Meyer |title =Thermal Insulating Capabilities of Outdoor Clothing Materials |publisher =ScienceMag.org |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/215/4533/690 |accessdate = 2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wool and polyesters perform reasonably well for most weather conditions and provide some insulation while wet.&lt;ref name=UnivOPitts&gt;{{cite web |title=Clothing Materials, subjective analysis of newer clothing materials for outdoor clothing |publisher =University of Pittsburgh edu |url= http://www.pitt.edu/~kconover/ftp/Clothing%20Materials.pdf |accessdate = 2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton/linen wicks moisture, good for hot/humid weather.&lt;ref name=UnivOPitts/&gt; Cotton, linen and down lose insulation when wet unless they are treated to be water-resistant.&lt;ref name=UnivOPitts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first =Matt |last =Heid |title=High-tech materials and the next generation of outdoor gear |publisher =AMC Outdoors |url= http://www.outdoors.org/publications/outdoors/2013/equipped/high-tech-fabrics.cfm |date = February 2013 |accessdate = 2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural fabrics, such as cotton, linen and wool have higher burn temperatures, and they char instead of melting when exposed to flame.&lt;ref name=WoolFacts&gt;{{cite web |title=Wool Facts |publisher =AussieSheepAndWool.com.au |url= http://www.aussiesheepandwool.com.au/webcontent5.htm |accessdate = 2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a fabric melts onto skin it is difficult to remove, unlike a material that chars. [[Nomex]] is used for fire-resistant clothing.&lt;ref name=MyCustomClothing&gt;{{cite web |title=The Burn Test – How To Test A Cloth Quality |publisher =MyCustomClothing.com |url= http://www.mycustomclothing.com/customtailor/The_Burn_Test_How_To_Test_A_Cloth_Quality.htm |accessdate = 2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wool is a good all-around fabric. Cotton and linen are best for hot weather and worst for cold, wet weather. Synthetics can be about the same as wool in the winter; many of them are fire hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Compare Fabric Materials |publisher=TeachEngineering.org |url= http://www.teachengineering.org/view_activity.php?url=collection/wpi_/activities/wpi_compare_fabric_materials/compare_fabric_materials.xml |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabrics can be treated to help reduce their disadvantages.

Down is the lightest  [[Thermal insulation|thermal-insulating]] material and compresses the most. Synthetics are next best. Wool is heavier than down and synthetics, and does not compress well. [[Stuff sack|Stuff sacks and compression sacks]] are used for carrying insulated clothing and sleeping bags. [[Layered clothing]] allows for fine tuning of body temperature. The inner-base layer should wick away moisture. The mid-layer is used for the appropriate insulation, and the outer-shell layer provides wind and rain protection.
 
For long trips, having enough clothes to change into is helpful, while washing or drying others. An extra pair of socks can be used as mittens. Shorts for swimming and fording streams are also useful. Wet clothes do not insulate as well and can freeze while a hiker is wearing them. If a hiker falls into ice water, an immediate dry change of clothes from a dry bag can be lifesaving. Layered clothing helps regulate body temperature in varying weather conditions.

[[Gloves]] provide protection from blisters, abrasions, cold and hot objects, and insects. General purpose gloves are a thin glove-liners—wool may be preferred around campfires—combined with a pair of leather gloves. Glove liners often provide enough dexterity while not fully exposing the hands to freezing conditions. Shoes with traction reduce the chance of slipping, causing an injury or death. Shoes that support the ankle may also prevent injury. Well-constructed, breathable, waterproof [[hiking boot]]s are general-purpose hiking shoes. [[Mountaineering boot]]s provide more specialized protection. [[Trainers]], [[sandles]], or [[moccasin]]s are useful for easy walks and may be taken on extended hikes as backup, and to wear when fording streams and in the evening around camp.&lt;ref name=NewHWguide&gt;{{cite web |title=British Mountaineering Council: New Hill Walkers guide |publisher=TheBMC.co.uk |url= https://www.thebmc.co.uk/media/files/Skills/New%20Hill%20Walkers.pdf |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterproof [[gaiters]] are used in cold or wet conditions to protect the lower pants and upper part of the shoes, and reduce the amount of water, snow, and debris from entering boots and soaking into other fabrics. Brush [[chaps]] or pants for thick brush or thorns, and snake chaps or gaiters help protect the legs from snake bites.

===Hot-wet-weather clothing===

[[File:Shelter.jpg|thumb|Poncho shelter]]
* Long-sleeved shirt and long pants provide sun and insect protection, and help to reduce abrasions when plowing through brush and when slipping and falling on rocks.
* [[Sun hat]]
* Bug jackets and head-nets provide insect protection and are especially useful if the insect repellent is either not effective or runs out. These are a couple items that hikers may use to minimize the use of insect repellent on their skin.
* Rain clothing made from [[waterproof fabric|waterproof]] or water-resistant fabrics, and preferably breathable, like [[Gore-Tex]]:
** [[Raincoat]]
** [[Rain pants]] and/or rain skirt (useful in hotter climates)
** [[Poncho|Rain poncho]], uses: [[tarpaulin]], ground cloth, backpack cover, hammock, stretcher
** Plastic bags made into a poncho and a rain skirt
** Gloves and socks. [[Latex]] (petroleum degrades them) or [[Nitrile rubber|Nitrile]] gloves (medical grade is the top grade)
** Plastic bags put on over socks then inserted into shoes
** Jungle footwear: vented boots to drain water, the best wicking socks possible, sandals with good walking straps or jungle moccasins&lt;ref name=RSOGjungle&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Rescue &amp; Special Operations, Jungle Kit  |publisher=USRSOG.org |url= http://www.usrsog.org/junkit.htm |date=2007 |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Snow-ice-cold clothing===
High-altitude hikers encounter freezing conditions, even in summer, and there are also permanent [[glacier]]s and snowfields.
[[File:Aa walking crampons.jpg|thumb|Walking crampons]]
* [[Parka]], insulated coat extending below the waist, are often hooded
* [[Ski suit|Snow pants]]: insulated, water-wind-resistant
* [[Long underwear]]
* [[Balaclava (clothing)|Balaclavas]] are versatile, because they can protect the head, neck and face from the cold. 
* Insulated face mask to provide a solid wind barrier for extreme cold that is beyond a balaclava.
* [[Scarf|Scarves]] are equally versatile and may be combined with [[knit hat]]s for the same effect as a balaclava.
* Gloves: insulated, breathable, and water-resistant. [[Mittens]] for the more extreme cold temperatures, but they offer less dexterity. Glove liners used with mittens provide more dexterity without fully exposing the hands to the elements.
* [[Snow boot]]s, [[mukluk]]s, [[bunny boots]]

==Shelter==
[[File:nammatjknoydart.jpg|thumb|Tunnel tent]]

===Overnight shelter===
[[File:Mod.SleepSystem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Modular sleep system]]
[[File:hammock with fly.jpg|thumb|right|225px |A [[Hammock camping|Hennessy tent hammock tent]] with [[tarpaulin|tarp]]]]
[[File:800px-tropical wet forests.png|thumb|right|225px|[[Tropical rainforest]] distribution]]

An overnight shelter may be as simple as a wool blanket and tarp, or a complete sleep-system inside a double-walled, four-season tent. Sleeping layers may be layered the same way as clothing layers: inner, mid, and outer shell. Bedding options range from a pillow made from clothes to a [[Modular Sleep System|sleep system]] comprising [[sleeping pad]], [[sleeping bag]], [[bivouac shelter]], bag liner, and [[compression sack]]. Shelter structures can be constructed from a [[tarpaulin]], ground sheet, rope, poles, or trees, with a mosquito net. [[Poncho|Rain poncho]] may be used as a ground sheet, or used as an overhead tarp, or rigged as a hammock. Tent hammocks comes with a bug net and overhead tarp. A cave, bivouac shelter, or debris shelter can also be used. Jungle shelters are used in [[jungle]]s and [[tropical rainforest]], where rainfall, mud, invertebrates, and snakes are common. A [[hammock#Venezuelan or jungle hammock|Venezuelan or jungle hammock]] is well ventilated, with a bug net and a covering tarpaulin.&lt;ref name=RSOGjungle/&gt; A platform can be built off the ground or tied into a tree. [[Trekking pole]]s can be used to construct a shelter; they can be used as poles for a tarpaulin. Some tents are designed to use trekking poles in place of carrying additional poles, a technique common in [[ultralight backpacking]].&lt;ref name=jardine /&gt;

===Continuous clothing-sleeping layers===
The line can blur or shift between clothing, bedding, and structural shelter. A rain-poncho and its thermal liner (or a regular poncho) is an example of equipment that can be clothing, bedding, and structural shelter. Ultralight backpackers use typical cold-weather clothes to extend the temperature ranges of their sleepingbags. Then this reasoning can extend to packing a winter coat and snow pants with a bivy bag before adding a two-pound sleeping bag. Adding an insulated pair of socks or down booties would complete the insulation layer.

Given an unexpected turn toward cold weather, bedding can be converted to mobile insulation, but if the pack already contains those items, then time and energy are saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canterbury|first1=Dave|title=Bushcraft 101: A Field Guide to the Art of Wilderness Survival|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1440579776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building a Discount Bushcraft Kit Part 5 (Wool Blankets), converting blanket to poncho|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkSscmFKKMM|website=YouTube.com|publisher=WildernessOutfitters|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic equipment and abilities==
The most basic hiking equipment is a stout knife, a pot, cordage, a few ways to make a fire, and equipment to carry water and other gear.&lt;ref name=RSOGEquip/&gt;
[[File:Ari's back.jpg|thumb|150px|A bandana]]
[[File:Eskimo snowgoggles.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Inuit]] snow goggles function by reducing exposure to sunlight, not by reducing its intensity]]
* [[Kerchief|Bandana]], uses: a hat, dust mask, face scarf, water filter, first-aid, signal, etc.; larger versions like a shawl, [[sarong]]
* Cutting, chopping, and sawing: [[knife]], [[multi-tool]], tomahawk, hatchet, axe, [[bucksaw]], [[Snow knife|snow knife or snow saw]]
* Container (see below)
* Cordage (see below)
* Digging: sharp stick, stout knife, [[trowel]], ice axe, [[entrenching tool]] (folding shovel), compact shovel, [[snow shovel]]
* Fire (see below)
* Light:
** Flashlight (UK torch) or two, preferably hands-free (headband or headlamp), spare batteries and bulb.
** [[Candle]] from wax or [[tallow]], or an [[oil lamp]]
** Fire and a wood [[torch]]
* Medical: [[first-aid]] kit, medicines, [[medicinal plants]], cloth, cordage, [[Cyanoacrylate|superglue]], Nitrile gloves
**Avoiding the need for medical treatment is preferable when possible by learning about [[nature]], water treatment, food poisoning, [[poison]]ous [[List of poisonous plants|plants]] and [[List of poisonous animals|animals]], and [[survival skills]] to avoid things like [[frostbite]].
* Sun protection:
** Clothing: long-sleeved shirt and pants, hat with a full brim or used with a bandana, thin gloves
** [[Sunglasses]]: year-round protection from blowing sand/snow, sharp objects, glare, and [[snow blindness]]. A band of cloth ([[Kerchief|bandana]]) or bark can be used to fashion a pair of emergency sunshades by cutting narrow slits in them. They are critical at high altitude.
** [[Sunscreen]] protects from some rays
** [[Lip balm]]
* Information: Having information includes being aware of the surroundings and events that may be relevant to the hiker. This starts by being able to navigate. Another part is the weather, being able to read the weather, having gathered the latest and longer predictions before a hike, and possibly having a weather radio for updates. Being able to see further (binoculars) and record what is seen maybe additional equipment in this area.
** [[Navigation|Navigate]] by reference, terrain, and by map and compass.
* [[Human swimming|Swimming]] goes with the first Rule of 3: air. If a hiker is swept off his or her feet into deep water, or falls into a lake, then swimming moves to the top of the list.&lt;ref name="98.6 Degrees" /&gt;

===Water kit===

Water needs to be [[Drinking water|drinkable]]. Hikers usually carry some, but do not carry all that they need, because it weighs one kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lbs) per liter, and hikers can consume 2-4+ liters per day (4–9&amp;nbsp;lbs). Additional water usually can be located, collected, [[Water filter|filtered]], and [[Water purification|purified]].&lt;ref name= Mountaineering&gt;{{cite book | last = Mountaineers | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills | publisher = AdventureLore press | year = | location = | url =  | doi = | id = |isbn=1594851387 | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =HighAltitudeDr&gt;{{cite web |first =Thomas E. |last =Dietz, MD |title =Water Treatment Methods |publisher=High-Altitude-Medicine.com |year= |url =http://www.high-altitude-medicine.com/water.html  |accessdate =2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =SurvivalOutdoorSkills&gt;{{cite web |first = |last = |title = Filter &amp; Purifying Water |publisher=SurvivalOutdoorSkills.com |year= |url =http://www.survivaloutdoorskills.com/purifying_water.htm  |accessdate =2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All water in the wild is potentially unclean.&lt;ref name =RSOGWater&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Rescue &amp; Special Operations, Water Procurement |publisher=USRSOG.org |url= http://www.usrsog.org/water.htm |date=2007 |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The details of '''locating water''' are beyond the scope of this article. The basics are using a map, knowing how water flows through and collects in certain geographical formations (natural [[cistern]]s), and identifying which plants indicate shallow-underground water and contain easily accessed water.&lt;ref name =RSOGWater/&gt; Heading downhill to streams, and looking for rich, green vegetation that may indicate a spring, are ways to start. Following bees and tracking animals to cisterns, knowing where to dig in apparent dry stream beds, and possibly waiting for night when vegetation releases water, are slightly more advanced techniques. Water can be collected in a clean container. Clear plastic bags can be used to make vegetation and [[solar still]]s. Dehydrated, chemical-free sponges can be used to wipe dew from vegetation, or tied to ankles before one walks through damp vegetation in the morning, soaking up water from wet rocks or sand.&lt;ref name =RSOGWater/&gt; A flexible drinking straw can access water in a rock crack, or drink from a water still without opening it. Tarpaulins can also be used to collect rain water or dew.

[[File:Metal Water Bottles.jpeg|right|thumb|Metal water bottles]]

To remove larger impurities, water can be filtered through grass, sand, charcoal or cloth, such as a bandana or pantyhose. Pantyhose can also be used as an emergency fishing net.&lt;ref name =TheModernSurvivalist&gt;{{cite web |title=Survival Kit: 5 Awkward but Useful Items! |publisher=TheModernSurvivalist.com |url= http://www.themodernsurvivalist.com/archives/2076 |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filtering water of larger impurities is a useful way to extend the life of commercial filters, preventing them from getting clogged quickly.

Water must be purified of harmful living organisms and chemicals. Some [[Portable water purification|commercial]] filters can remove most organisms and some harmful chemicals, but they are not 100% effective.&lt;ref name =Berkey&gt;{{cite web |title=Survival Sport Berkey Portable Water Filter |publisher=BerkeyBilters.com |url =http://www.berkeyfilters.com/The%20Sport%20Berkey7-24-14.pdf |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Distillation]] filters, purifies, and removes some harmful chemicals. Chemicals with a lower or about equal boiling point of water are not eliminated by distilling.&lt;ref name =SurvivalDoctor&gt;{{cite web |first =James |last =Hubbard, MD, MPH |title = How to Remove Chemicals from Drinking Water |publisher=TheSurvivalDoctor.com |year= |url =http://www.thesurvivaldoctor.com/2014/01/20/how-to-remove-chemicals-from-drinking-water/ |accessdate =2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iodine]] or [[chlorine dioxide]] solutions or tablets can be used to purify water.&lt;ref name=HighAltitudeDr /&gt; It can be boil water in a fire-resistant pot or water bottle. Water can be boiled in some flammable materials like bark because the water absorbs the heat. [[Pasteurization]] takes place at temperatures lower than boiling point, but knowing the temperature of the water and calculating the duration of treatment can be difficult. This technique is useful when only non-durable containers are available. Sunlight can be used with a clear container.&lt;ref name=TheModernSurvivalist /&gt; Filters made from heat-treated [[diatomaceous earth]] can also be used.&lt;ref name=Berkefeld&gt;{{cite web|title=Water treatment solutions since 1892, Cholera epidemic |publisher=Berkefeld.com |url =http://www.berkefeld.com/en/company/history/ |accessdate= 2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hydration Reservoir.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Hydration reservoir]]

===Transporting water===
A wide-mouth, metal [[water bottle]] or a metal pot or cup can also be used to boil and transport water, and can be used fairly easily for cooking. A lid for the pot will help water to boil sooner, helps with cooking by requiring less fuel, and reduces water loss. Other containers for transporting water include appropriate plastic water bottles in materials like [[Nalgene]]. There are hard plastic bottles, and soft-collapsible bottles. A [[hydration pack]] tube freezes easily. A non-lubricated [[condom]] can hold up to two liters, but is very vulnerable to puncture. Placing a stick in the knot will allow it to be re-used.&lt;ref name=TheModernSurvivalist/&gt;&lt;ref name=WillowHavenOutdoor&gt;{{cite web|title=11 Ways A Condom Can Save Your Life |publisher=WillowHavenOutdoor.com |url =http://willowhavenoutdoor.com/featured-wilderness-survival-blog-entries/1-ways-a-condom-can-save-your-life-multi-functional-survival-uses-for-a-condom/ |accessdate= 2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breast milk bags are plastic bags that double-Ziploc, so they are easier to reseal than a condom and they do not puncture as easily. They are transparent, allowing solar purification and can be used as a magnifying lens to start a fire.&lt;ref name=TheModernSurvivalist/&gt; Containers that may freeze with water in them may allow for 10% expansion; they may be filled to 90%.&lt;ref name=WaterExpansion&gt;{{cite web |title=Why does water expand when it freezes? |url=http://iapws.org/faq1/freeze.htm |website=The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam |date=April 21, 2000 |accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oral rehydration therapy]] packets can be added to water to help replace electrolytes.&lt;ref name=RehydrateFormula&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wadhwani |first1=Nand |title=Oral Rehydration Solutions: Made at Home |url=http://rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm#recipe |website=Rehydrate.org|publisher=The Mother and Child Health and Education Trust |date=July 4, 2014 |accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RehydrateDanger&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wadhwani |first1=Nand |title=Why is Dehydration so Dangerous? |url=http://rehydrate.org/dehydration/index.html |website=Rehydrate.org |publisher=The Mother and Child Health and Education Trust |date=April 24, 2014 |accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RehydrateImportance&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wadhwani |first1=Nand |title=Why is Rehydration so Important and How it Works to Save Children's Lives |url=http://rehydrate.org/rehydration/index.html |website=Rehydrate.org |publisher=The Mother and Child Health and Education Trust |date=April 24, 2014 |accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire kit===

[[Fire]] needs [[Firelighting|ignition]], oxygen, and [[fuel]], and the ability to be extinguish. Ignition can come from a spark, a chemical reaction, electricity, or concentrated solar energy. The more oxygen involved, the easier the fire starts and the hotter it burns. Organic material must either be dry or the fire must be hot enough to dry it and burn it. Fraying organic material is more combustible as a [[tinder]]. [[Dust explosion|Grain dust]] and granulated sugar can ignite when oxygenated over a flame.

[[File:Bow Drill with annotations.jpg|thumb|140px|Diagram of a [[bow drill]] designed for fire starting]]
[[Image:Hobo stove convection 2.jpg|thumb|140px|Heat [[convection]] in a hobo stove]]
[[File:Campfire 4213.jpg|thumb|175px|A campfire]]

Sources of ignition include [[flint]], carbon steel, [[firesteel]] and a sharp edge, [[match]]es, [[Butane torch|butane]] and [[Zippo]], and peanut [[lighters]], and [[magnifying glass]]es.
Fuels include natural substances like dry wood, peat and coal. [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], [[petroleum jelly]], [[Char cloth|charred cotton]], shaved rubber, and frayed synthetic cloth can be used as kindling. Candles provide illumination and can help start a fire. [[Alcohol]], DIY and commercial alcohol stoves are made and carried by hikers. Oil, petroleum, vegetable, and [[tallow]] can help start and feed a fire. [[Propane]] bottles are made for backpacking. [[Charcoal]] or [[briquette]]s could be packed in the fire.

'''Sure fire''' is a way to start a fire in bad conditions or when a hiker has no man-made equipment, like when the fuel is wet, or the lighter has run out of fuel. Some hikers will carry tinder in a few forms, such as a few cotton balls soaked in pure [[petroleum jelly]], fat wood ([[pitch (resin)|pitch]]). [[Methylnaltrexone|Alcohol-wipes]] and alcohol-hand-sanitizers are other options. [[Vegetable oil]]s, and some fruit oils, like [[olive oil]], [[coconut oil]], corn chips, or nuts are edible and can be used to help start a fire because of the oil in them. "Bad" conditions also includes high altitude because of less oxygen, high winds blowing out a fire, high humidity that soaks either the fuel source or the igniter.&lt;ref name=RSOGfire&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Rescue &amp; Special Operations, Fire |publisher=USRSOG.org |url= http://www.usrsog.org/fire.htm |date=2007 |accessdate = 2014-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To '''extinguish''' a campfire, see [[Campfire#Extinguishing the fire|extinguishing a campfire]]. Knowing ways to survive a [[wildfire]] may also be helpful.

===Cordage===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
[[File:MIL-C-5040 Type III 550 Paracord.jpg|thumb|170px|MIL-SPEC MIL-C-5040 Type III Paracord has seven to nine inner yarns made up of three strands each.]]
Cordage provides the abilities to bind, build, repair, and prevent damage. It comes in many sizes and materials, and can be used for building shelters and traps, flossing teeth, fishing, repairing and making clothes, replacing shoelaces, gluing or taping things together. Many cordages are made from natural materials. Some types of cordage are:
* [[Parachute cord]] is flexible; its inner threads can be easily pulled out to make longer cordage, or used as threads for sewing or fishing.
* Sewing and suturing thread, dental floss, fishing line, bank line, string, twine, clothes line.
* Wire, such as tripwire or snare wire, has many uses.
* Lanyards, straps, belts, bungee cords
* Tape: [[medical tape]], [[duct tape]], [[gaffer tape]]
* Elastic/rubber bands (slingshot&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rubber+band+slingshot slingshot]&lt;/ref&gt;), condoms&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=condom+slingshot condoms]&lt;/ref&gt; for a slingshot
* Climbing rope for shelters, cliffs, and scrambling
* Superglue

===Containers===
[[Image:Ziplock.jpg|right|thumb|A Ziploc-branded zipper storage bag]]

There are a variety of containers for organizing and keeping equipment dry:
* Clear, [[Zipper storage bag|plastic Ziploc freezer bags]] in quart and gallon sizes can be used for emergency water purification and transportation. When filled with equipment and clothes, they become inflated and may help with emergency flotation. 
* [[Dry bag]]s are heavier, more durable, and provide the same benefits. A dry-bag can be used as an emergency container for boiling water using the hot-rock method. 
* [[Stuff sack]]s and compression sacks help reduce the volume of clothes and sleeping bags. 
* Hard-sided, plastic containers that seal using an O-ring may be used to carry critical or expensive equipment, such as electronics, and for the kit that holds the main pocket items.

== Food ==
[[File:Gorp.jpg|thumb|right|200px |[[Trail mix]] made from peanuts, raisins, and candy coated chocolate, around 4.8 kcal/gram&lt;ref name=USDATrailMix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ |title=USDA food database: Snacks, trail mix |publisher=Nal.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303184216/http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ |archivedate=2015-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Military [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|ready meals]] provide a wide range of food options for hikers; they tend to be higher in fat and salt than is appropriate for sedentary people.&lt;ref name=MREAnatomy&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/page/?o=RrzKj&amp;page_id=69473&amp;v=P|title=Anatomy of an MRE |last=Martin |first=Don |date=February 24, 2008 |publisher=Neil Gunton |accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meals are not dehydrated, and are not intended for more than a few days of hiking. Most of them are not designed to minimize the space they take in a pack.

In addition to a food's expiration date,&lt;ref name=USDADates&gt;{{cite web |title=Food Product Dating |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/food-product-dating/food-product-dating |publisher=USDA.gov |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the main considerations for hiking food are water content, caloric density (more energy per pound for a given space), and nutritional density (more nutrition per pound for a given space). Water weighs one gram per cubic centimeter, or 8.33 pounds per gallon, so a 4-liter (1 gallon) food container can weigh up to eight pounds less when it contains dehydrated food. Dehydrating foods can reduce weight and may reduce nutrition while increasing the need for water to reconstitute the food. More weight also expends more energy, so packing lighter foods reduces the need for more calories. Calories equate to energy. Nutrition becomes more important as the number of hiking days increases; for example MREs are not intended to be used beyond ten days.&lt;ref name=MREAnatomy /&gt; Multi-vitamins may help offset some nutrition deficiencies.

The three [[macronutrient]]s are fats (lipids), carbohydrates (sugars and starches), and protein. [[Fat]]s are calorie dense and nutritionally important, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] are a good example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Sally |last1=Fallon |first2=Mary G. |last2=Enig, PhD |title=The Skinny on Fats |publisher=WestonAPrice.org |url =http://www.westonaprice.org/know-your-fats/skinny-on-fats = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbohydrates (starches and sugars) that release energy slowly (as measure by [[glycemic index]] and [[glycemic load]] or the [[insulin index]]) give sustained energy, such as [[legume]]s and [[whole grain]]s. Some sources of [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] are meats, dairy products, fish, eggs, whole grains, pulses, legumes, and nuts. These are the reasons that "trail" mix usually has dried fruit and a variety of nuts.&lt;ref name=USDATrailMix/&gt; Nuts and dried fruit can last a long time based on their expiration date. The USDA's page on expiration dates is available online.&lt;ref name=USDADates/&gt;

Not all food needs to be dehydrated or dried. When a hiker plans to carry a couple liters of water, that is 4.4 pounds of water weight that can be carried in fresh fruits and vegetables for the first day. The same is true for other foods based on their water-weight. Depending on which ones are chosen, this can eliminate or reduce the need for cooking, and the reconstitution time. One of the first meals on a hike could be a [[Greek salad]] with a [[fruit cocktail]], followed later with refried beans and [[tortillas]]. Nut-butter and honey sandwiches on [[flatbread]] can last longer depending on the preservatives in the bread and nut-butter. The same is true for canned goods, most of the weight is in the water. Selecting a canned food is the same: calorie and nutritional dense. Using this can put a hiker down the trail a day or two with little difference in the foods normally eaten.

Taking foods that do not require cooking provides for higher mobility (not stopping to cook), and allows for the contingencies of not having a fire, the cook stove breaking, or running out of fuel. In general, the foods in a grocery store that are not in the refrigerated-freezer sections, are available for the trail.

No-bake home-made "energy" protein bars may contain oatmeal, ground flaxseed, arrowroot powder (medicinal uses), peanut butter, powdered nuts, chopped nuts, coconut oil (multi-use), coconut flakes, dried fruit, cinnamon (medicinal), cooked beans, and natural sweeteners, like honey; they may also be baked. Baked versions may contain natural sweeteners like bananas, applesauce, grated carrots and zucchini.  Either way, they and the no-bake ingredients may be used for the trail.&lt;ref name="FoodCookies"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vegan No-Bake Chocolate Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookies |publisher=Food.com |url= http://www.food.com/recipe/vegan-no-bake-chocolate-peanut-butter-oatmeal-cookies-418785 |accessdate = 2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArrowrootPudding"&gt;{{cite web |title=No bake Arrowroot pudding..Indonesian Delight |publisher=UKRasoi.com |url =http://www.ukrasoi.com/2011/10/arrowroot-pudding.html |accessdate = 2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArrowrootCookies"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chocolate Arrowroot Cookies (No Gluten, No Sugar) |publisher=Food.com |url =http://www.food.com/recipe/chocolate-arrowroot-cookies-no-gluten-no-sugar-401533 |accessdate = 2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EnergyBars"&gt;{{cite web |first=Christine |last=Hein |title=Homemade Energy Bars |publisher=Food.com |url =http://www.nomeatathlete.com/homemade-energy-bars/ |accessdate = 2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flavor enhancers: salt, salt substitute, powdered peppers, spices, dried herbs, powdered bullion or cubes, hot sauce.

If food supplies run out, a field guide to edible, medicinal, and poisonous plants may be useful. Or a hiker could study them ahead of time. As the movie [[Into the Wild (film)|"Into the Wild"]] brought out, some poisonous plants look like edible plants. He had a field guide with him but did not notice the details well enough.

Vegan note: The equipment in this article comes from hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, balanced with how much a hiker wants to carry and is willing to risk. Within that context, if the worse scenario happens and starvation is imminent, then it may be too late to choose and learn and be able to fish and trap. As neutrally stated, the decision becomes an informed choice.

If hikers plan their food carefully, they may wind up eating more healthily on the trail.

==Refrigeration==
Water and food can be cooled in snow. [[Evaporation]] causes cooling and is used in the [[pot-in-pot refrigerator]]. Placing green grass or a sponge into a hat and soaking it with water is another technique. Bottled water can be cooled in a stream.

===Cooking===
[[File:Portable stove.jpg|thumb|right|A small portable stove running on gas and the stove's white carrying case]]
Ultralight backpackers rely only on food that does not need cooking, and reconstitute dehydrated, pre-cooked food without cooking it. A hot drink or meal may help someone with a lower body temperature or help boost morale.&lt;ref name=RSOGreap&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Rescue &amp; Special Operations, Chasing the Reaper |publisher=USRSOG.org |url =http://www.usrsog.org/reaper.htm |date=2007 |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an emergency, most locations would supply material for a fire, as long as there was a container that could withstand the heat. Some options and tradeoffs for choosing equipment.

'''Cooking options'''
Cooking options may range from a candle to a bonfire, and may include a solar oven, or a Fresnel lens, or more typical tools and other options:
{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
* [[Alcohol stove]]
* [[Beverage can stove]]
* [[Billycan]]
* [[Campfire]]
** Cooking in tinfoil pockets
** Cooking with green-sticks
** Steaming food in appropriate green leaves
** Using a metal grill
** Using thin rocks as a skillet
* [[Cook stove]]
* [[Hobo stove]]
* [[Portable stove]]
* [[Rocket stove]]
* [[Shichirin]]
{{div col end}}

Common '''utensils''': knife, fork, spoon, and [[spork]]. A butter knife may not be an optimal weight item considering that other knives may be available, or at least it may be sharpened. Utensils may be carved from wood. A fork spears food, so can a sharp stick or a knife. [[Sporks]] trade off the volume of the spoon with the ability to spear food. A mid-sized, sturdy metal spoon may be used for cooking, eating, and digging. Even if not cooking, utensils can be useful as tools.
* [[Mess kit]] or cookset is a nested set, usually containing a pot with a lid, some times the lid doubles is a frying pan or plate, a bowl, and possibly a cup.
* Towel, bandana, or cotton T-shirt
* Biodegradable soap, or natural cleansers like baking soda, vinegar, pure lemon crystals

==Personal hygiene==
Equipment not already in the kitchen.
* Dental hygiene: toothbrush (may be sharpened for a marlin spike for rope work), etc.
* Feminine hygiene that doubles as first-aid and tinder: tampons, pads
* Toilet paper (tinder), wet wipes (sure fire)
* Tweezers, in a kit, in a multi-tool, on a keyring

==Electronics==
[[Image:Motorola hand-held.jpg|150px|right|thumb|A modern [[Project 25]]-capable professional walkie-talkie]]
Handheld-waterproof electronics (or stored in waterproof bags) with spare batteries for critical gear. Some devices come with different power options: solar, hand-crank, and/or USB. And then there are portable [[solar power|solar]]-[[Battery charger#Solar chargers|charging system]]s. Depending on electronics to work in [[Lethality|life-and-death]] situations means that the hiker's life is at risk when the equipment fails.
* AM-news-[[weather radio]]
* Camera, extra film/memory card
* Cell phone
* [[Personal Locator Beacon|Personal-locator beacon]] or other [[emergency locator beacon]], especially important in possible avalanche areas&lt;ref name="RockyMtnPLB"&gt;{{cite web |title=Emergency personal beacons: A primer |publisher=RockyMountainRescue.org |url= http://www.rockymountainrescue.org/about_PLBs.php |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NzPLB"&gt;{{cite web |title=Safety Tips – Mountain Radios, Tranceivers, Personal Locator Beacons |publisher=.MountaipunSafety.org |url=http://www.mountainsafety.org.nz/Safety-Tips/Mountain-Radios-Tranceivers--Personal-Locator-Beacons.asp |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scanner (radio)|Emergency-channel scanner]]
* Flashlight, a red filter saves night vision, but reduces sight distance and signalling; carry a spare bulb.
* [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), a lightweight yet rugged and waterproof model with a long battery life, memory for [[topographical map]]s, base map ability (so a hiker can drive to the trail) plus the ability to store notes. These are not to be used as a primary navigation tool (as some of their instructions read), but when a hiker can only see a few feet, a GPS can help. If conditions are that bad, then recreational hikers may use it to head toward shelter, versus using it to get into worse conditions, farther from help, and risk having it fail.
* [[Laser pointer]] for signaling but can cause eye damage
* [[Strobe light]]&lt;ref name=RSOGEquip/&gt;
* VHF radio: emergency [[airband]]-aircraft communication, amateur/[[ham radio]], [[FM radio]] (news), [[Radio spectrum#marine band|marine-band radio]] for talking to ships
* [[Walkie talkie]] or [[citizens band radio]]
* [[Water purification#Ultraviolet disinfection|UV water purifier]]: purifies water using laser-UV light, may double as a flashlight

[[File:Audiovisual.jpg|thumb|This home cinema satellite speaker provides high-quality audio when watching a concert on the flat screen television.]]
'''Home audio''' systems are [[audio electronics]] intended for home entertainment use, such as [[shelf stereo]]s and [[surround sound]] receivers. Home audio generally does not include standard equipment such as built-in television speakers, but rather accessory equipment, which may be intended to enhance or replace standard equipment, such as standard TV speakers. Since surround sound receivers, which are primarily intended to enhance the reproduction of a movie, are the most popular home audio device, the primary field of home audio is [[home cinema]].

==History==
===Monaural===
Home audio dates back before electricity, to [[Phonograph#First phonograph|Edison's phonograph]], a [[monaural]], [[low fidelity]] sound reproduction format. Early electrical phonographs as well as many other audio formats started out as monaural formats.

===Stereo===
[[Stereophonic sound]] was invented as a means of creating a sound stage, a more realistic reproduction of the sound as recorded live. Stereo sound usually refers to two-channel audio, but technically it refers to anything better than monaural audio, as the term literally means "solid sound."

===Quadraphonic===
[[Quadraphonic]] sound was a four-channel reproduction system, which is considered to be the origin of [[surround sound]]. It was recorded on phonograph, tape, and a few [[Compact disc|CDs]], and required a quadraphonic player for playback. The format was released in 1970 and never gained much popularity.

===Surround sound===
[[Surround sound]] formats were used in movie theatres dating back to Disney's [[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]], and became available to consumers in the late 80's. There are many formats of surround sound, differing based on the type of decoding processor they used. [[Dolby Pro Logic]] is one of the oldest processors, creating four channels, and [[Dolby Pro Logic#Dolby Pro Logic IIx|Dolby Pro Logic IIx]] is one of the newest, creating seven or eight discrete channels. Competing technologies have complicated the purchasing decisions of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;''Downtime, Home Theater: Rival Sound Formats Mean Consumer Static'' Downtime By Lawrence B. Johnson March 5, 1998 Technology section New York Times https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0DB1331F936A35750C0A96E958260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Player equipment==
[[HiFi]] equipment was available to consumers followed by [[boombox|boomboxes]] becoming popular in the 1980s due to availability of cheaper batteries.

[[File:Slurry Wall Hydromill In Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|upright|Hydromill trench cutter with two cutter wheels at bottom]]
The '''hydromill trench cutter''' is a type of [[construction equipment]] designed to dig the narrow but deep trenches used in the casting of [[slurry wall]]s. Typically, it is a cutter attachment mounted on a [[crawler crane]] base machine, with different types of hose handling systems. The machine excavates by cutting the soil using two cutting wheels, while a powerful pump extracts the loose material mixed with some of the slurry, typically [[bentonite]].

== Machine components==
The hydromill, also known as hydraulic cutter, basically consists of:
* Base machine, usually a crawler [[Crane (machine)|crane]], of adequate capacity
* Hose handling system, for both hydraulic and slurry hoses, these systems can vary between hose tension, or hose drum
* Hydraulic cutter, which typically consists of two cutting wheels, a slurry pump, and flaps to control its direction in case of deviation

Usually, there are two sets of hoses, one for hydraulic oil, and another for extraction of slurry from the diaphragm wall.

== Cutter wheels ==
Hydraulic cutter assemblies have a standard length of {{convert|2.8|m}}, with various widths, varying from {{convert|60|cm}} up to {{convert|250|cm}}. Cutting wheel teeth depend mainly on the type of soil intended to be excavated.

Insteon is a subsidiary of [[Smartlabs|Smartlabs, Inc.]], also based in Irvine, CA.

==History==
Insteon was founded in 2005 in Irvine, CA by CEO Joe Dada.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;  Dada had previously founded Smarthome in 1992, a home automation product catalog company, and operator of the Smarthome.com e-commerce site.  In the late 1990s, Dada acquired two product engineering firms which undertook extensive product development efforts to create networking technology based on both power-line and RF communications.  In 2004, the company filed for patent protection for the resultant technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.google.com/patents/US8081649|title=Network of intelligent devices communicating via powerline and radio frequency US 8081649 B2 |publisher=US Patent Office |date=2004-12-15 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; called Insteon, and it was released in 2005.  In 2012, the company released the first network-controlled light bulb using Insteon-enabled technology, and at that point Dada spun Insteon off from Smarthome.&lt;ref name = "wired"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ocbj.com/news/2015/jan/06/insteon-partners-nest/ | title= Insteon Partners With Nest | publisher= Orange County Business Journal|date=January 6, 2015|accessdate= October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jigar Shah''' (born August 30, 1974) is a clean energy entrepreneur in creating market-driven solutions and eliminating market barriers to address [[climate change]].  Shah has recognized this as "Creating Climate Wealth."

Shah maintains that Climate Wealth is created when mainstream investors team up with entrepreneurs, corporations, mainstream capital, and governments at scale to solve the big problems of our time while generating compelling financial returns – not concessionary returns.&lt;ref name="Jigar Shah"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |url= http://www.fastcompany.com/user/jigar-shah|title=Fast Company: Jigar Shah|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current business initiatives==
Shah is the co-founder and President of Generate Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://gigaom.com/2014/12/04/these-investors-are-using-the-solar-as-a-service-model-for-resources/  |title=Meet Generate Capital, a new way to fund energy projects |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah was the founder and CEO of SunEdison (NASDAQ: SUNE), where he pioneered “no money down solar” and unlocked a multi-billion-dollar solar market, creating the largest solar services company worldwide. Shah is author of ''Creating Climate Wealth: Unlocking the Impact Economy, 2013 Icosa Publishing''.  The book talks about the prominent role of business model innovation, more than new technology, in attracting mainstream capital and unlocking transformational change. In the book, the author pictures reaching our 2020 climate change goals as means to create the next economy with the equivalent of 100,000 companies worldwide, each generating $100 million in sales. Shah argues that, while new technical innovation is valuable, deployment of existing technologies are the key to reaching our near-term climate targets.

Shah serves as a board member of the ''Carbon War Room'', a global organization he previously served as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.solarplaza.com/article/solar-guru-jigar-shah-on-his-new-book-creating-cli|title= Solar Guru Jigar Shah on his new book: 'Creating Climate Wealth'|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah has also become an outspoken advocate to end all energy subsidies, including those for renewable energy, to "create a level playing field." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/republican-congressman-to-oil-and-gas-industry-no-more-subsidies|title=Jigar Shah argues for an end to fossil fuel subsidies -- and a phase-out of clean energy subsidies'|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Jigar served as a mentor for Unreasonable at Sea, a technology business accelerator for social entrepreneurs seeking to scale their ventures in international markets. Founded by Unreasonable Group, [[Semester at Sea]], and  [[Stanford]]'s [[Hasso Plattner Institute of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.semesteratsea.org/discover-sas/signature-programs/past-programs/unreasonable-at-sea/&lt;/ref&gt; Shah writes for Unreasonable Group's venture UNREASONABLE.is, a hub for [[social entrepreneurs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://unreasonable.is/?s=jigar+shah&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Energy Gang==
Shah is currently co-host of The Energy Gang,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.greentechmedia.com/podcast/the-energy-gang&lt;/ref&gt; a podcast dedicated to exploring the technological, political and market forces driving energy and environmental issues.  On a recent episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://soundcloud.com/the-energy-gang/week-7-trump-dumps-the-climate|title=Week 7: Trump Dumps the Environment|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah introduced the Jigar Shah Rule - "Countries should not have stupid policy".  As noted by co-host Stephen Lacy, the new ruling is pulled directly from the Jigar Shah Playbook, which suggests you must have competitive options such as volumetric reductions and feed-in tariffs, and the way these were designed seven to eight years ago do not work.

==Past business initiatives==
From 2009 to March 2012, Shah served as the first CEO of the [[Carbon War Room]], the global organization founded by Richard Branson and Virgin United that works to harness the power of entrepreneurship to deploy solution technologies at scale.

Prior to his tenure as Carbon War Room CEO, Shah founded [[SunEdison]] in 2003. The company simplified solar as a service through the implementation of the [[power purchase agreement]] (PPA) business model. That model changed the status quo, allowing organizations to purchase solar energy services under long-term predictably priced contracts and avoid the significant capital costs of ownership and operation of solar energy systems. The SunEdison business model is a recognized{{Vague|date=January 2014}} catalyst that helped turn solar PV into a multi-billion{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} dollar industry worldwide.

Shah previously worked in strategy for [[BP Solar]] and as a contractor for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] on alternative vehicles and fuel cell programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jigar-shah/|title = Jigar Shah Bio |accessdate= 22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born in India, Shah moved to the United States with his family when he was one year old.  Shah moved to [[Sterling, Illinois|Sterling]], [[Illinois]] when he was eight years old.&lt;ref name="BIF6"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BIF6 |url=http://www.businessinnovationfactory.com/bif-6/storytellers/jigar-shah |title=Jigar Shah, taking on a Gigaton of Change |accessdate=2013-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831145455/http://www.businessinnovationfactory.com/bif-6/storytellers/jigar-shah |archivedate=August 31, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:London - Imperial College of Science and Technology.jpg|thumb|Imperial College, London, where Chitty worked.]]

'''Letitia Chitty''' (15 July 1897 – 29 September 1982) was an English engineer who became a respected structural analytical engineer, achieving several firsts for women engineers, including becoming the first female fellow of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] and the first female recipient of the [[Telford Medal]].

==Education==

Chitty was spotted as a talented mathematician in her teens. During [[World War I]], when still a maths student, Chitty was recruited as a teenager to do war work with [[Alfred Pippard]] at the [[Admiralty Air Department]]. She subsequently changed subjects, studied engineering, and graduated from [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College Cambridge]] with first class honours in the Mechanical Sciences [[Tripos]], 1921, the first woman to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1921|title=News of members|journal=The Woman Engineer (Women's Engineering Society Journal)|publisher=Women's Engineering Society|volume=1|issue=8|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Imperial&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/centenary/timeline/1930.shtml|title=Imperial College Timeline 1930s|last=|first=|date=2007|website=Imperial College|publisher=|access-date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haines"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haines|first1=Catharine M.C.|title=International Women in Science: A Biographical Dictionary to 1950|date=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576070901|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
Her early career focused on analysing the stresses of airframes, airships and [[civil engineering]] structures, initially with the Admiralty Air Department and then, after graduating, at the [[Air Ministry]] with [[Richard V. Southwell|Richard Southwell]] and Alfred Pippard.

===Work with Tarrant Tabor===
[[Tarrant Tabor|W. G. Tarrant]], previously a timber merchant, designed a massive bomber at the end of World War I, the [[Tarrant Tabor]]. The original [[biplane]] design had to be altered to [[triplane]] to accommodate more engines, and the Admiralty Air Department was asked to check its structural strength. Chitty was given this task.

In her own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Tarrant was an inspired timber merchant who dreamed of a super-[[Sopwith Camel|Camel]]. It hadn't a chance. It was too big, too heavy - that wasn't its fault, but Grade A spruce had by now run out and it had to be built of American white wood (tulip). In my language, 3,500 instead of 5,500 lb/sq in."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Giants of the sky|last=Gunston|first=Bill|publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd;|year=1991|isbn=1852602589|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tragically, her mathematical analysis was not heeded. The plane crashed nose down during its first take-off, from the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] at [[Farnborough Airport|Farnborough]] on 26 May 1919, killing both pilots and seriously injuring the other six people on board.

==Later career==
Chitty moved to [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] in 1934 where she remained for the rest of her career, initially specialising in structural stresses in aircraft.&lt;ref name=Imperial /&gt; During the 1930s, she was part of a group which analysed the crash of the airship R58, and published various Air Ministry papers on stresses and strains on airship structures.&lt;ref name="Haines" /&gt; She was an early member of the [[Women's Engineering Society]].

Her [[World War II]] work included research into stresses in [[submarine]] hulls under shell attack, extensible cables and pulley blocks for [[barrage balloons]], for the Director of Scientific Research of the [[Admiralty]] and the [[Ministry of Supply]]. Later research interests included arches and arch dams - in particular, the [[Dukan Dam]] in Iraq - and she contributed to an international symposium on arched dams in 1968.&lt;ref name="Haines" /&gt;

Initially an Imperial College research assistant, Chitty became a lecturer in 1937, and retired in 1962. She was the first female Fellow of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] (FRAeS), the third female Corporate Member of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] and the first woman to be appointed to an ICE technical committee, in 1958. She was awarded four [[Telford Premium]] medals for papers written with Pippard, and in 1969 became the first woman to receive the Telford Gold Medal.&lt;ref name="Haines" /&gt;

'''Lidar''' (also called '''LIDAR''', '''LiDAR''', and '''LADAR''') is a [[surveying]] method that measures distance to a target by illuminating the target with [[pulsed laser]] light and measuring the reflected pulses with a sensor. Differences in laser return times and wavelengths can then be used to make digital [[3D modeling|3-D representations]] of the target. The name ''lidar'', now used as an acronym of ''light detection and ranging''&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web|title=LIDAR—Light Detection and Ranging—is a remote sensing method used to examine the surface of the Earth |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=June 4, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H82i1Gfx?url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html |archivedate=June 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes ''light imaging, detection, and ranging''), was originally a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[light]]'' and ''[[radar]]''.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;&lt;ref name="James Ring p. 672-3"&gt;James Ring, "The Laser in Astronomy." pp. 672–73, ''New Scientist'' June 20, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Lidar sometimes is called '''3D laser scanning''', a special combination of a [[3D scanning]] and [[laser scanning]]. It has terrestrial, airborne, and mobile applications.

Lidar is commonly used to make high-resolution maps, with applications in [[geodesy]], [[geomatics]], [[archaeology]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[geomorphology]], [[seismology]], [[forestry]], [[atmospheric physics]],&lt;ref name="cracknell"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Cracknell| first = Arthur P. | last2 = Hayes| first2 = Ladson| title = Introduction to Remote Sensing| place=London| publisher = Taylor and Francis| year = 2007| origyear = 1991| edition = 2| oclc = 70765252| isbn = 978-0-8493-9255-9| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[laser guidance]], airborne laser swath mapping (ALSM), and [[Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter|laser altimetry]].

==History and etymology==
Lidar originated in the early 1960s, shortly after the invention of the [[laser]], and combined laser-focused imaging with the ability to calculate distances by measuring the time for a signal to return using appropriate sensors and data acquisition electronics. Its first applications came in meteorology, where the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] used it to measure [[clouds]].&lt;ref name=Goyer&gt;{{cite journal|last= Goyer|first= G. G.|author2=R. Watson |title= The Laser and its Application to Meteorology|journal= Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|date= September 1963|volume=44|issue= 9|pages= 564–575 [568]|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general public became aware of the accuracy and usefulness of lidar systems in 1971 during the [[Apollo 15]] mission, when astronauts used a laser altimeter to map the surface of the moon.

Although now most sources treat the word "lidar" as an acronym,&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt; the term originated as a [[portmanteau]] of "[[light]]" and "[[radar]]". The first published mention of lidar, in 1963, makes this clear: "Eventually the laser may provide an extremely sensitive detector of particular wavelengths from distant objects. Meanwhile, it is being used to study the moon by 'lidar' (light radar)&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="James Ring p. 672-3"/&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' supports this etymology.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite book|title= Oxford English Dictionary|year=2013|page=Entry for "lidar"|url= http://www.oed.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpretation of "lidar" as an acronym ("LIDAR" or "LiDAR") came later, beginning in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;"New Artillery Against Smog: TV and Lidar" ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1970, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; based on the assumption that since the base term "radar" originally started as an acronym for "Radio Detection And Ranging", "LIDAR" must stand for "Light Detection And Ranging",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/RESEARCH/RSD/main/lidar/lidar.shtml |title=Light Detection and Ranging |website=Ngs.noaa.gov |date=2011-04-15 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for "Laser Imaging, Detection And Ranging".&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|20090273770|patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the English language no longer treats "radar" as an acronym and printed texts universally present the word uncapitalized, the word "lidar" became capitalized as "LIDAR" or "LiDAR" in some publications beginning in the 1980s. Currently no consensus exists on capitalization, reflecting uncertainty about whether or not "lidar" is an acronym, and if it is an acronym, whether it should appear in lower case, like "radar". Various publications refer to lidar as "LIDAR", "LiDAR", "LIDaR", or "Lidar". The [[USGS]] uses both "LIDAR" and "lidar", sometimes in the same document;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lidar.cr.usgs.gov/ |title=CLICK |website=Lidar.cr.usgs.gov |date=2015-09-16 |accessdate=2016-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219045753/http://lidar.cr.usgs.gov/ |archivedate=2016-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[New York Times]]'' predominantly uses "lidar" for staff written articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Science&amp;region=TopBar&amp;WT.nav=searchWidget&amp;module=SearchSubmit&amp;pgtype=article#/lidar/since1851/document_type%3A%22article%22/ |title=NYTimes.com search |website=nytimes.com |date=|accessdate=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; although contributing news feeds such as Reuters may use Lidar;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/03/29/technology/29reuters-uber-tech-alphabet-lawsuit.html |title=Waymo Self-Driving Unit Sought Arbitration Over Engineer Now at Uber|website=nytimes.com |date=2017-03-29 |accessdate=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General description==
Lidar uses [[ultraviolet]], [[Interferometric visibility|visible]], or [[near infrared]] light to image objects. It can target a wide range of materials, including non-metallic objects, rocks, rain, chemical compounds, [[aerosols]], clouds and even single [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="cracknell" /&gt; A narrow laser beam can map physical features with very high [[Optical resolution|resolutions]]; for example, an aircraft can map terrain at {{convert|30|cm|adj=on}} resolution or better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Carter, Jamie|author2=Keil Schmid|author3=Kirk Waters|author4=Lindy Betzhold|author5=Brian Hadley|author6=Rebecca Mataosky|author7=Jennifer Halleran|title=Lidar 101: An Introduction to Lidar Technology, Data, and Applications."

The essential concept of Lidar was originated by [[EH Synge]] in 1930, who envisaged the use of powerful searchlights to probe the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, 1930, Series 7, Volume 9, Issue 60, pp. 1014-1020&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donegan, J.F.; ''[https://www.livingedition.at/en/isbn/9783901585173/ The Life and Works of Edward Hutchinson Synge]'' pp. 31, 67, (co-edited with D. Weaire and [[Petros Serghiou Florides|P. Florides]]), Pöllauberg, Austria : Living Edition, {{ISBN|3901585176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Lidar has since been used extensively for atmospheric research and [[meteorology]]. Lidar instruments fitted to [[aircraft]] and [[satellite]]s carry out [[surveying]] and mapping – a recent example being the U.S. Geological Survey Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar.&lt;ref&gt;'Experimental Advanced Advanced Research Lidar', ''USGS.gov''. Retrieved 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] has identified lidar as a key technology for enabling autonomous precision safe landing of future robotic and crewed lunar-landing vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Amzajerdian, Farzin |author2=Pierrottet, Diego F. |author3=Petway, Larry B. |author4=Hines, Glenn D. |author5=Roback, Vincent E. |title=Lidar Systems for Precision Navigation and Safe Landing on Planetary Bodies|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20110012163|website=Langley Research Center|publisher=NASA|accessdate=May 24, 2011|date=2011-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wavelengths vary to suit the target: from about 10 [[micrometer (unit)|micrometer]]s to the [[Ultraviolet|UV]] (approximately 250 [[nanometer|nm]]). Typically light is reflected via [[backscatter]]ing, as opposed to pure reflection one might find with a mirror. Different types of scattering are used for different lidar applications: most commonly [[Rayleigh scattering]], [[Mie scattering]], [[Raman scattering]], and [[fluorescence]].&lt;ref name="cracknell" /&gt; Suitable combinations of wavelengths can allow for remote mapping of atmospheric contents by identifying wavelength-dependent changes in the intensity of the returned signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zGlQDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA678&amp;lpg=PA678&amp;dq=Suitable+combinations+of+wavelengths+can+allow+for+remote+mapping+of+atmospheric+contents+by+identifying+wavelength-dependent+changes+in+the+intensity+of+the+returned+signal#v=onepage&amp;q=Suitable%20combinations%20of%20wavelengths%20can%20allow%20for%20remote%20mapping%20of%20atmospheric%20contents%20by%20identifying%20wavelength-dependent%20changes%20in%20the%20intensity%20of%20the%20returned%20signal&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Optoelectronics: Concepts, Devices, and Techniques (Volume One)|last=P.

==Design==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:LIDAR-scanned-SICK-LMS-animation.gif|thumb|'''Click image to see animation.''' A basic lidar system involves a laser range finder reflected by a rotating mirror (top). The laser is scanned around the scene being digitized, in one or two dimensions (middle), gathering distance measurements at specified angle intervals (bottom).]]
The two kinds of lidar detection schemes are "incoherent" or direct energy detection (which principally measures amplitude changes of the reflected light) and [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] detection (best for measuring [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] shifts, or changes in phase of the reflected light). Coherent systems generally use [[optical heterodyne detection]]. This is more sensitive than direct detection and allows them to operate at a much lower power, but requires more complex transceivers.

Both types employ pulse models: either ''micropulse or'' ''high energy''. Micropulse systems utilize intermittent bursts of energy. They developed as a result of ever-increasing computer power, combined with advances in laser technology. They use considerably less energy in the laser, typically on the order of one [[Joule#Microjoule|microjoule]], and are often "eye-safe", meaning they can be used without safety precautions. High-power systems are common in atmospheric research, where they are widely used for measuring atmospheric parameters: the height, layering and densities of clouds, cloud particle properties ([[refractive index#Dispersion and absorption|extinction coefficient]], backscatter coefficient, [[depolarization]]), temperature, pressure, wind, humidity, and trace gas concentration (ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, etc.).&lt;ref name="cracknell" /&gt;

== Components ==

Lidar systems consist of several major components.

=== Laser ===
600–1000 [[nanometre|nm]] [[laser]]s are most common for non-scientific applications. Maximum power is limited by the need to make them eye-safe (in applications that operate around people).

One common alternative, 1550&amp;nbsp;nm lasers, are eye-safe at relatively high power levels since this wavelength is not strongly absorbed by the eye, but the detector technology is less advanced and so these wavelengths are generally used at longer ranges with lower accuracies. They are also used for military applications because 1550&amp;nbsp;nm is not visible in [[Night vision device|night vision goggles]], unlike the shorter 1000&amp;nbsp;nm infrared laser.

Airborne topographic mapping lidars generally use 1064&amp;nbsp;nm diode pumped [[YAG]] lasers, while [[bathymetric]] (underwater depth research) systems generally use 532&amp;nbsp;nm frequency doubled diode pumped YAG lasers because 532&amp;nbsp;nm penetrates water with much less [[attenuation]] than does 1064&amp;nbsp;nm. Laser settings include the laser repetition rate (which controls the data collection speed). Pulse length is generally an attribute of the laser cavity length, the number of passes required through the gain material (YAG, [[YLF]], etc.), and [[Q-switch]] (pulsing) speed. Better target resolution is achieved with shorter pulses, provided the lidar receiver detectors and electronics have sufficient bandwidth.&lt;ref name="cracknell" /&gt;

==== Solid state lasers ====
Solid-state electronics by definition have no moving parts.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/solid-state-lidar-for-self-driving-cars/|title=A self-driving car in every driveway? Solid-state lidar is the key|last=Mokey|first=Nick|date=2018-03-15|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Flash lidar =====
Flash uses a single light source that illuminates the field of view in a single pulse.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Seeing at a distance requires a powerful burst of light. The power is limited to levels that do not damage human retinas. Wavelengths must not affect human eyes. However, low cost silicon imagers do not read light in the eye-safe spectrum. Instead, [[Gallium arsenide|gallium-arsenide]] imagers are required, which can boost costs to $200,000.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===== Phased arrays =====
A phased array can illuminate any direction by using a microscopic array of individual antennas. Controlling the timing (phase) of each antenna steers a cohesive signal in a specific direction.

[[Phased array]]s have been used in [[radar]] since the 1950s. The same technique can be used with light. On the order of a million optical antennas are used to see a radiation pattern of a certain size in a certain direction. The system is controlled by  timing the precise flash. A single chip (or a few) replace a $75,000 electromechanical system, drastically reducing costs.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The control system can change the shape of the lens to enable zoom in/zoom out functions. Specific sub-zones can be targeted at sub-second intervals.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Electromechanical lidar lasts for between 1,000 and 2,000 hours. By contrast, solid-state lidar can run for 100,000 hours.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==== Micro electromechanical mirrors ====
Micro electromechanical mirrors (MEMS) are not entirely solid-state. However, their tiny form factor provides many of the same cost benefits. A single laser is directed to a single mirror that can be reoriented to view any part of the target field. The mirror spins at a rapid rate. However, MEMS systems generally operate in a single plane (left to right). To add a second dimension generally requires a second mirror that moves up and down. Alternatively another laser can hit the same mirror from another angle. MEMS systems can be disrupted by shock/vibration and may require repeated calibration.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Scanner and optics ===
Image development speed is affected by the speed at which they are scanned. Options to scan the [[azimuth]] and elevation include dual oscillating plane mirrors, a combination with a polygon mirror and a [[Laser scanning|dual axis scanner]]. Optic choices affect the angular resolution and range that can be detected. A hole mirror or a [[beam splitter]] are options to collect a return signal.

=== Photodetector and receiver electronics ===
Two main [[photodetector]] technologies are used in lidar: [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid state]] photodetectors, such as silicon avalanche [[photodiode]]s, or [[photomultiplier]]s. The sensitivity of the receiver is another parameter that has to be balanced in a lidar design.

=== Position and navigation systems ===
Lidar sensors mounted on mobile platforms such as airplanes or satellites require instrumentation to determine the absolute position and orientation of the sensor. Such devices generally include a [[Global Positioning System]] receiver and an [[Inertial Measurement Unit]] (IMU).

=== Sensor ===
Lidar uses active sensors that supply their own illumination source. The energy source hits objects and the reflected energy is detected and measured by sensors. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between transmitted and backscattered pulses and by using the speed of light to calculate the distance traveled.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthdata.nasa.gov/user-resources/remote-sensors#hyperspectral|title=Remote Sensors {{!}} Earthdata|website=earthdata.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-03-18}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3-D imaging can be achieved using both scanning and non-scanning systems. "3-D gated viewing laser radar" is a non-scanning laser ranging system that applies a pulsed laser and a fast gated camera. Research has begun for virtual beam steering using [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) technology.

Imaging lidar can also be performed using arrays of high speed detectors and modulation sensitive detector arrays typically built on single chips using [[complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor]] (CMOS) and hybrid CMOS/[[Charge-coupled device]] (CCD) fabrication techniques. In these devices each pixel performs some local processing such as demodulation or gating at high speed, downconverting the signals to video rate so that the array can be read like a camera. Using this technique many thousands of pixels / channels may be acquired simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Medina, Antonio|title=Three Dimensional Camera and Rangefinder|publisher=United States Patent 5081530|volume=January 1992|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; High resolution 3-D lidar cameras use [[homodyne detection]] with an electronic CCD or CMOS [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]].&lt;ref name="Medina A, Gayá F, and Pozo F 800–805 http://www.opticsinfobase.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?URI=josaa-23-4-800"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Medina A, Gayá F, Pozo F|year=2006|title=Compact laser radar and three-dimensional camera|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?URI=josaa-23–4–800|journal=J.

A coherent imaging lidar uses [[synthetic array heterodyne detection]] to enable a staring single element receiver to act as though it were an imaging array.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

In 2014, [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory|Lincoln Laboratory]] announced a new imaging chip with more than 16,384 pixels, each able to image a single photon, enabling them to capture a wide area in a single image. An earlier generation of the technology with one fourth that number of pixels was dispatched by the U.S. military after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake; a single pass by a business jet at 3,000 meters (10,000&amp;nbsp;ft.) over Port-au-Prince was able to capture instantaneous snapshots of 600-meter squares of the city at a resolution of {{convert|30|cm}}, displaying the precise height of rubble strewn in city streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/524166/the-worlds-most-powerful-3-d-laser-imager/|title=The World's Most Powerful 3-D Laser Imager|date=2014-02-13|website=technologyreview.com|accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lincoln system is 10x faster. The chip uses [[indium gallium arsenide]] (InGaAs), which operates in the infrared spectrum at a relatively long wavelength that allows for higher power and longer ranges. In many applications, such as self-driving cars, the new system will lower costs by not requiring a mechanical component to aim the chip. InGaAs uses less hazardous wavelengths than conventional silicon detectors, which operate at visual wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Talbot|first=David|date=2014-02-13|title=New Optical Chip Will Sharpen Military and Archeological Aerial Imaging|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/524166/the-worlds-most-powerful-3-d-laser-imager|accessdate=2014-02-17|magazine=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

===Based on orientation===
Lidar can be oriented to [[nadir]], [[zenith]], or laterally.
For example, lidar altimeters look down, an atmospheric lidar looks up, and lidar-based collision avoidance systems are side-looking.

===Based on platform===
Lidar applications can be divided into airborne and terrestrial types.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Airborne and terrestrial laser scanning|last = Vosselman|first = George|publisher = Whittles Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-904445-87-6|location = |pages = |last2 = Maas|first2 = Hans-Gerd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two types require scanners with varying specifications based on the data's purpose, the size of the area to be captured, the range of measurement desired, the cost of equipment, and more.
Spaceborne platforms are also possible.

==== Airborne  ====
Airborne lidar (also ''airborne laser scanning'') is when a laser scanner, while attached to an aircraft during flight, creates a [[Point cloud|3-D point cloud]] model of the landscape. This is currently the most detailed and accurate method of creating [[digital elevation model]]s, replacing [[photogrammetry]]. One major advantage in comparison with photogrammetry is the ability to filter out reflections from vegetation from the point cloud model to create a [[Digital Surface Model|digital surface model]] which represents ground surfaces such as rivers, paths, cultural heritage sites, etc., which are concealed by trees. Within the category of airborne lidar, there is sometimes a distinction made between high-altitude and low-altitude applications, but the main difference is a reduction in both accuracy and point density of data acquired at higher altitudes. Airborne lidar can also be used to create bathymetric models in shallow water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Airborne laser bathymetry for documentation of submerged archaeological sites in shallow water|url = http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-5-W5/99/2015/|journal = ISPRS – International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences|pages = 99–107|volume = XL-5/W5|doi = 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-5-w5-99-2015|first = M.|last = Doneus|first2 = I.|last2 = Miholjek|first3 = G.|last3 = Mandlburger|first4 = N.|last4 = Doneus|first5 = G.|last5 = Verhoeven|first6 = Ch.|last6 = Briese|first7 = M.|last7 = Pregesbauer|bibcode = 2015ISPArXL55...99D |year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main constituents of airborne lidar include [[digital elevation model]]s (DEM) and digital surface models (DSM). The points and ground points are the vectors of discrete points while DEM and DSM are interpolated raster grids of discrete points. The process also involves capturing of digital aerial photographs. In order to interpret deep seated landslides for example, under the cover of vegetation, scarps, tension cracks or tipped trees air borne lidar is used. Air borne lidar digital elevation models can see through the canopy of forest cover, perform detailed measurements of scarps, erosion and tilting of electric poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiu|first=Cheng-Lung|last2=Fei|first2=Li-Yuan|last3=Liu|first3=Jin-King|last4=Wu|first4=Ming-Chee|title=National Airborne Lidar Mapping and Examples for applications in deep seated landslides in Taiwan|journal=Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2015 IEEE International|issn= 2153-7003|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airborne lidar data is processed using a toolbox called Toolbox for Lidar Data Filtering and Forest Studies (TIFFS)&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; for lidar data filtering and terrain study software. The data is interpolated to digital terrain models using the software. The laser is directed at the region to be mapped and each point's height above the ground is calculated by subtracting the original z-coordinate from the corresponding digital terrain model elevation. Based on this height above the ground the non-vegetation data is obtained which may include objects such as buildings, electric power lines, flying birds, etc. The rest of the points are treated as vegetation and used for modeling and mapping. Within each of these plots, lidar metrics are calculated by calculating statistics such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, percentiles, quadratic mean, etc.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuan|first=Zeng|last2=Yujin|first2=Zhao|last3=Dan|first3=Zhao|last4=Bingfang|first4=Wu|title=Forest Biodiversity mapping using airborne and hyper-spectral data|journal=Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2016 IEEE International |issn=2153-7003|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Airborne lidar bathymetry =====
The airborne lidar [[bathymetric]] technological system involves the measurement of time of flight of a signal from a source to its return to the sensor. The data acquisition technique involves a sea floor mapping component and a ground truth component that includes video transects and sampling. It works using a green spectrum (532&amp;nbsp;nm) laser beam.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/corbin/class_description/Nayegandhi_green_lidar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Two beams are projected onto a fast rotating mirror, which creates an array of points. One of the beams penetrates the water and also detects the bottom surface of the water under favorable conditions.

The data obtained shows the full extent of the land surface exposed above the sea floor. This technique is extremely useful as it will play an important role in the major sea floor mapping program. The mapping yields onshore topography as well as under water elevations. Sea floor reflectance imaging is another solution product from this system which can benefit mapping of underwater habitats. This technique has been used for three dimensional image mapping of California's waters using a hydrographic lidar.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=C. Wilson|first=Jerry|title=Using Airborne hydrographic lidar to support mapping of California's waters|journal=OCEANS 2008 – MTS/IEEE Kobe Techno-Ocean, {{ISBN|978-1-4244-2126-8}}|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yellowscan LIDAR on OnyxStar FOX-C8 HD.jpg|thumb|250x250px|LIDAR scanning performed with a multicopter [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]].]]
[[Drone aircraft|Drones]] are now being used with laser scanners, as well as other remote sensors, as a more economical method to scan smaller areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Drone remote sensing for forestry research and practices|journal = Journal of Forestry Research|date = 2015-06-21|issn = 1007-662X|pages = 791–797|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s11676-015-0088-y|language = en|first = Lina|last = Tang|first2 = Guofan|last2 = Shao}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of drone remote sensing also eliminates any danger that crews of a manned aircraft may be subjected to in difficult terrain or remote areas.

==== Terrestrial  ====
Terrestrial applications of lidar (also ''terrestrial laser scanning'') happen on the Earth's surface and can be either stationary or mobile. Stationary terrestrial scanning is most common as a survey method, for example in conventional topography, monitoring, cultural heritage documentation and forensics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Point cloud|3-D point clouds]] acquired from these types of scanners can be matched with digital images taken of the scanned area from the scanner's location to create realistic looking 3-D models in a relatively short time when compared to other technologies. Each point in the point cloud is given the colour of the pixel from the image taken located at the same angle as the laser beam that created the point.

Mobile lidar (also ''mobile laser scanning'') is when two or more scanners are attached to a moving vehicle to collect data along a path. These scanners are almost always paired with other kinds of equipment, including [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]] receivers and [[Inertial measurement unit|IMUs]]. One example application is surveying streets, where power lines, exact bridge heights, bordering trees, etc. all need to be taken into account. Instead of collecting each of these measurements individually in the field with a [[Tachymeter (survey)|tachymeter]], a 3-D model from a point cloud can be created where all of the measurements needed can be made, depending on the quality of the data collected. This eliminates the problem of forgetting to take a measurement, so long as the model is available, reliable and has an appropriate level of accuracy.

Terrestrial lidar mapping involves a process of occupancy grid map generation. The process involves an array of cells divided into grids which employs a process to store the height values when lidar data falls into the respective grid cell. A binary map is then created by applying a particular threshold to the cell values for further processing. The next step is to process the radial distance and z-coordinates from each scan to identify which 3-D points correspond to each of the specified grid cell leading to the process of data formation.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sang-Mook|last2=Joon Im|first2=Jeong|last3=Lee|first3=Bo-Hee|last4=Leonessa|first4=Alexander|last5=Kurdila|first5=Andrew|title=A real time grid-map generation and object classification for ground based 3D lidar data using image analysis techniques|journal=Image Processing (ICIP), 2010 17th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing |issn= 1522-4880|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:LIDAR equipped mobile robot.jpg|thumb|This [[mobile robot]] uses its lidar to construct a map and avoid obstacles.]]

There are a wide variety of applications for lidar, in addition to the applications listed below, as it is often mentioned in [[National lidar dataset]] programs.

===Agriculture===
[[File:LIDAR field yield.jpg|thumb|alt=Graphic of a lidar return, featuring different crop yield rates.|Lidar is used to analyze yield rates on agricultural fields.]]

[[Agricultural robot]]s have been used for a variety of purposes ranging from seed and fertilizer dispersions, sensing techniques as well as crop scouting for the task of weed control.

Lidar can help determine where to apply costly fertilizer. It can create a topographical map of the fields and reveal slopes and sun exposure of the farm land. Researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] used this topographical data with the farmland yield results from previous years, to categorize land into zones of high, medium, or low yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100609.htm |title=ARS Study Helps Farmers Make Best Use of Fertilizers |publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service |date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates where to apply fertilizer to maximize yield.

Another application is crop mapping in orchards and vineyards, to detect foliage growth and the need for pruning or other maintenance, detect variations in fruit production, or count plants.

Lidar is useful in GPS-denied situations, such as nut and fruit orchards, where foliage blocks GPS signals to [[precision agriculture]] equipment or a [[driverless tractor]]. Lidar sensors can detect the edges of rows, so that farming equipment can continue moving until GPS signal is reestablished.

==== Plant species classification ====
Controlling weeds requires identifying plant species. This can be done by using 3-D lidar and machine learning.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Weiss|first=Ulrich|last2=Biber|first2=Peter|last3=Laible|first3=Stefan|last4=Bohlmann|first4=Karsten|last5=Zell|first5=Andreas|year=2010|title=Plant Species Classification using a 3D LIDAR Sensor and Machine Learning|journal=Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)|volume=|isbn=978-1-4244-9211-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lidar produces plant contours as a "point cloud" with range and reflectance values. This data is transformed, and features are extracted from it. If the species is known, the features are added as new data. The species is labelled and its features are initially stored as an example to identify the species in the real environment. This method is efficient because it uses a low-resolution lidar and supervised learning. It includes an easy-to-compute feature set with common statistical features which are independent of the plant size.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Archaeology===
Lidar has many uses in archaeology, including planning of field campaigns, mapping features under forest canopy, and overview of broad, continuous features indistinguishable from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/whitecourt.htm |title=EID; crater beneath canopy |publisher=Unb.ca |date=2013-02-18 |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lidar can produce high-resolution datasets quickly and cheaply. Lidar-derived products can be easily integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) for analysis and interpretation.

Lidar can also help to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) of archaeological sites that can reveal micro-topography that is otherwise hidden by vegetation. The intensity of the returned lidar signal can be used to detect features buried under flat vegetated surfaces such as fields, especially when mapping using the infrared spectrum. The presence of these features affects plant growth and thus the amount of infrared light reflected back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/light-fantastic/|title=The Light Fantastic: Using airborne lidar in archaeological survey|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2010|page=45|authorlink=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at [[Fort Beauséjour]] – Fort Cumberland National Historic Site, Canada, lidar discovered archaeological features related to the siege of the Fort in 1755. Features that could not be distinguished on the ground or through aerial photography were identified by overlaying hill shades of the DEM created with artificial illumination from various angles. Another example is work at [[Caracol]] by [[Arlen F Chase|Arlen Chase]] and his wife [[Diane Zaino Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/science/11maya.html?pagewanted=all|title=Mapping Ancient Civilization, in a Matter of Days|author=John Nobel Wilford|date=2010-05-10|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, lidar was used to search for the legendary city of [[La Ciudad Blanca]] or "City of the Monkey God" in the [[La Mosquitia]] region of the Honduran jungle.

==== Object detection for transportation systems ====
{{split section|Lidar for collision detection in transportation|date=September 2018}}

In transportation systems, to ensure vehicle and passenger safety and to develop electronic systems that deliver driver assistance, understanding vehicle and its surrounding environment is essential. Lidar systems play an important role in the safety of transportation systems. Lots of electronic systems which add to the driver assistance and vehicle safety such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Emergency Brake Assist, Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) depend on the detection of a vehicle's environment to act autonomously or semi-autonomously. Lidar mapping and estimation achieve this.

Basics overview: Current lidar systems use rotating hexagonal mirrors which split the laser beam. The upper three beams are used for vehicle and obstacles ahead and the lower beams are used to detect lane markings and road features.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Takagi|first=Kiyokazu|last2=Morikawa|first2=Katsuhiro|last3=Ogawa|first3=Takashi|last4=Saburi|first4=Makoto|title=Road Environment Recognition Using On-vehicle LIDAR|journal=IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium |year=2006 |isbn= 978-4-901122-86-3|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major advantage of using lidar is that the spatial structure is obtained and this data can be fused with other sensors such as [[radar]], etc. to get a better picture of the vehicle environment in terms of static and dynamic properties of the objects present in the environment. Conversely, a significant issue with lidar is the difficulty in reconstructing point cloud data in poor weather conditions. In heavy rain, for example, the light pulses emitted from the lidar system are partially reflected off of rain droplets which adds noise to the data, called 'echoes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7795918/|title=Test methodology for rain influence on automotive surround sensors - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below mentioned are various approaches of processing lidar data and using it along with data from other sensors through sensor fusion to detect the vehicle environment conditions.

===== GRID based processing using 3-D lidar and fusion with radar measurement =====
In this method, proposed by Philipp Lindner and Gerd Wanielik, laser data is processed using a multidimensional occupancy grid.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lindner|first=Philipp|last2=Wanielik|first2=Gerd|title=3D LIDAR Processing for Vehicle Safety and Environment Recognition|journal=IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Vehicles and Vehicular Systems |year=2009 |isbn= 978-1-4244-2770-3|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from a four-layer laser is pre-processed at the signal level and then processed at a higher level to extract the features of the obstacles. A combination two- and three-dimensional grid structure is used and the space in these structures is [[Tessellation|tessellated]] into several discrete cells. This method allows a huge amount of raw measurement data to be effectively handled by collecting it in spatial containers, the cells of the evidence grid. Each cell is associated with a probability measure that identifies the cell occupation. This probability is calculated by using the range measurement of the lidar sensor obtained over time and a new range measurement, which are related using [[Bayes' theorem]]. A two dimensional grid can observe an obstacle in front of it, but cannot observe the space behind the obstacle. To address this, the unknown state behind the obstacle is assigned a probability of 0.5. By introducing the third dimension or in other terms using a multi-layer laser, the spatial configuration of an object could be mapped into the grid structure to a degree of complexity. This is achieved by transferring the measurement points into a three-dimensional grid. The grid cells which are occupied will possess a probability greater than 0.5 and the mapping would be color coded based on the probability. The cells that are not occupied will possess a probability less than 0.5 and this area will usually be white space. This measurement is then transformed to a grid coordinate system by using the sensor position on the vehicle and the vehicle position in the world coordinate system. The coordinates of the sensor depends upon its location on the vehicle and the coordinates of the vehicle is computed using [[Visual odometry#Egomotion|egomotion]] estimation, which is estimating the vehicle motion relative to a rigid scene. For this method, the grid profile must be defined. The grid cells touched by the transmitted laser beam are calculated by applying [[Bresenham's line algorithm]]. To obtain the spatial extended structure, a connected component analysis of these cells is performed. This information is then passed on to a [[Rotating calipers|rotating caliper]] algorithm to obtain the spatial characteristics of the object. In addition to the lidar detection, RADAR data obtained by using two short range radars is integrated to get additional dynamic properties of the object, such as its velocity. The measurements are assigned to the object using a potential distance function.

; Advantages and disadvantages 
The geometric features of the objects are extracted efficiently, from the measurements obtained by the 3-D occupancy grid, using rotating caliper algorithm. Fusing the radar data to the lidar measurements give information about the dynamic properties of the obstacle such as velocity and location of the obstacle with respect to the sensor location which helps the vehicle or the driver decide the action to be performed in order to ensure safety. The only concern is the computational requirement to implement this data processing technique. It can be implemented in real time and has been proven efficient if the 3-D occupancy grid size is considerably restricted. But this can be improved to an even wider range by using dedicated spatial datastructures that manipulate the spatial data more effectively, for the 3-D grid representation.

===== Fusion of 3-D lidar and color camera for multiple object detection and tracking =====
The framework proposed in this method by Soonmin Hwang et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hwang|first=Soonmin|last2=Kim|first2=Namil|last3=Choi|first3=Yukyung|last4=Lee|first4=Seokju|last5=So Kweon|first5=In|title=Fast Multiple Objects Detection and Tracking Fusing Color Camera and 3D LIDAR for Intelligent Vehicles|journal=13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI) |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-5090-0821-6|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is split into four steps. First, the data from the camera and 3-D lidar is input into the system. Both inputs from lidar and camera are parallelly obtained and the color image from the camera is calibrated with the lidar. To improve the efficiency, horizontal 3-D point sampling is applied as pre-processing. Second, the segmentation stage is where the entire 3-D points are divided into several groups per the distance from the sensor and local planes from close plane to far plane are sequentially estimated. The local planes are estimated using statistical analysis. The group of points closer to the sensor are used to compute the initial plane. By using the current local plane, the next local plane is estimated by iterative update. The object proposals in the 2-D image are used to separate foreground objects from background. For faster and accurate detection and tracking Binarized Normed Gradients for Objectness Estimation at 300fps is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cheng|first=Ming-Ming|last2=Zhang|first2=Ziming|last3=Lin|first3=Wen-Yan|last4=Torr|first4=Philip|title=BING: Binarized normed gradients for objectness estimation at 300fps|journal=IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) |year=2014 |isbn= 978-1-4799-5118-5|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BING is a combination of normed gradient and its binarized version which speeds up the feature extraction and testing process, to estimate the objectness of an image window. This way the foreground and background objects are separated. To form objects after estimating the objectness of an image using BING, the 3-D points are grouped or clustered. Clustering is done using [[DBSCAN]] (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm which could be robust due to its less-parametric characteristic. Using the clustered 3-D points, i.e. 3-D segment, more accurate region-of-interests (RoIs) are generated by projecting 3-D points on the 2-D image. The third step is detection, which is broadly divided into two parts. First is object detection in 2-D image which is achieved using Fast R-CNN&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Girshick|first=Ross|title=Fast R-CNN|journal=IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) |year= 2015 |isbn= 978-1-4673-8391-2|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as this method doesn't need training and it also considers an image and several regions of interest. Second is object detection in 3-D space that is done by using the spin image method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=E. Johnson|first=Andrew|last2=Hebert|first2=Martial|title=Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3D scenes|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) |year=1999 |issn=0162-8828|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method extracts local and global histograms to represent a certain object. To merge the results of 2-D image and 3-D space object detection, same 3-D region is considered and two independent classifiers from 2-D image and 3-D space are applied to the considered region. Scores calibration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Philippe|last2=Davoine|first2=Franck|last3=Denoeux|first3=Thierry|title=Evidential combination of pedestrian detectors|journal=Proceedings British Machine Vision Conference, BMVA Press |date= September 2014|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is done to get a single confidence score from both detectors. This single score is obtained in the form of probability. The final step is tracking. This is done by associating moving objects in present and past frame. For object tracking, segment matching is adopted. Features such as mean, standard deviation, quantized color histograms, volume size and number of 3-D points of a segment are computed. Euclidean distance is used to measure differences between segments. To judge the appearance and disappearance of an object, similar segments (obtained based on the Euclidean distance) from two different frames are taken and the physical distance and dissimilarity scores are calculated. If the scores go beyond a range for every segment in previous frame, the object being tracked is considered to have disappeared.

; Advantages and disadvantages 
The advantages of this method are using 2-D image and 3-D data together, F l-score (which gives a measure of test's accuracy), average precision (AP) are higher than that when only 3-D data from lidar is used. These scores are conventional measurements which judge the framework. The drawback of this method is the usage of BING for object proposal estimation as BING predicts a small set of object bounding boxes.

This method proposed by Kun Zhou et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zhou|first=Kun|last2=Wang|first2=Xiqin|last3=Tomizukat|first3=Masayoshi|last4=Zhang|first4=Wei-Bin|last5=Chant|first5=Ching-Yao|title=A New Manoeuvring Target Tracking Algorithm with Input Estimation|journal=Proceedings of the 2002 American Control Conference |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-7803-7298-6|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only focuses on object detection and tracking but also recognizes lane marking and road features. As mentioned earlier the lidar systems use rotating hexagonal mirrors that split the laser beam into six beams. The upper three layers are used to detect the forward objects such as vehicles and roadside objects. The sensor is made of weather-resistant material. The data detected by lidar are clustered to several segments and tracked by [[Kalman filter]]. Data clustering here is done based on characteristics of each segment based on object model, which distinguish different objects such as vehicles, signboards, etc. These characteristics include the dimensions of the object, etc. The reflectors on the rear edges of vehicles are used to differentiate vehicles from other objects. Object tracking is done using a 2-stage Kalman filter considering the stability of tracking and the accelerated motion of objects&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Lidar reflective intensity data is also used for curb detection by making use of robust regression to deal with occlusions. The road marking is detected using a modified Otsu method by distinguishing rough and shiny surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Y. Hata|first=Alberto|last2=F. Wolf|first2=Denis|year=|title=Feature Detection for Vehicle Localization in Urban Environments Using a Multilayer LIDAR|url=|journal=IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System|volume=17|pages=|issn=1558-0016|via=|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Advantages
Roadside reflectors that indicate lane border are sometimes hidden due to various reasons. Therefore, other information is needed to recognize the road border. The lidar used in this method can measure the reflectivity from the object. Hence, with this data road border can also be recognized. Also the usage of sensor with weather-robust head helps detecting the objects even in bad weather conditions. Canopy Height Model before and after flood is a good example. Lidar can detect high detailed canopy height data as well as its road border.

Lidar measurements help identify the spatial structure of the obstacle. This helps distinguish objects based on size and estimate the impact of driving over it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Lidar systems provides better range and a large field of view which helps detecting obstacles on the curves. This is one major advantage over RADAR systems which have a narrower field of view. The fusion of lidar measurement with different sensors makes the system robust and useful in real-time applications, since lidar dependent systems can't estimate the dynamic information about the detected object.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

It has been shown that lidar can be manipulated, such that self-driving cars are tricked into taking evasive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/07/hackers-trick-self-driving-cars-lidar-sensor|title=Hackers can trick self-driving cars into taking evasive action|journal=The Guardian|first=Samuel|last=Gibbs|date=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lidar has also found many applications in [[forestry]]. [[canopy (forest)|Canopy]] heights, [[biomass]] measurements, and leaf area can all be studied using airborne lidar systems. Similarly, lidar is also used by many industries, including Energy and Railroad, and the Department of Transportation as a faster way of surveying. Topographic maps can also be generated readily from lidar, including for recreational use such as in the production of [[orienteering]] maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lidarbasemaps.org |title=Lidar Links of Use in Mapping |website=Lidarbasemaps.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the [[Save the Redwoods League]] has undertaking a project to map the tall redwoods on the Northern California coast. Lidar allows research scientists to not only measure the height of previously unmapped trees, but to determine the biodiversity of the redwood forest. [[Stephen Sillett]], who is working with the League on the North Coast lidar project, claims this technology will be useful in directing future efforts to preserve and protect ancient redwood trees.&lt;ref&gt;Councillor Quarterly, Summer 2007 Volume 6 Issue 3&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Geology and soil science===
High-resolution [[digital elevation map]]s generated by airborne and stationary lidar have led to significant advances in [[geomorphology]] (the branch of geoscience concerned with the origin and evolution of the Earth surface topography). The lidar abilities to detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks, to measure the land-surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy, to better resolve spatial derivatives of elevation, and to detect elevation changes between repeat surveys have enabled many novel studies of the physical and chemical processes that shape landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hughes, M.

In 2005 the [[Tour Ronde]] in the [[Mont Blanc massif]] became the first high [[Alps|alpine mountain]] on which lidar was employed to monitor the increasing occurrence of severe rock-fall over large rock faces allegedly caused by climate change and degradation of permafrost at high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabatel|first1=Antoine|last2=Deline|first2=Philip|last3=Jaillet|first3=Ste'phane|last4=Ravanel|first4=Ludovic|title=Rock falls in high-alpine rock walls quantified by terrestrial lidar measurements: A case study in the Mont Blanc area|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=28 May 2008|volume=35|issue=10|pages=L10502|doi=10.1029/2008GL033424|bibcode = 2008GeoRL..3510502R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In geophysics and tectonics, a combination of aircraft-based lidar and [[GPS]] has evolved into an important tool for detecting [[Fault (geology)|fault]]s and for measuring [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]. The output of the two technologies can produce extremely accurate elevation models for terrain – models that can even measure ground elevation through trees. This combination was used most famously to find the location of the [[Seattle Fault]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/19144_quake18.shtml |title=LIDAR shows where earthquake risks are highest |website=Seattlepi.com |date=2001-04-17 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combination also measures uplift at [[Mt.

The NASA Airborne Topographic Mapper&lt;ref&gt;[http://atm.wff.nasa.gov/ 'Airborne Topographic Mapper', ''NASA.gov'']. Retrieved 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; is also used extensively to monitor [[glacier]]s and perform coastal change analysis.
The combination is also used by soil scientists while creating a [[soil survey]]. The detailed terrain modeling allows soil scientists to see slope changes and landform breaks which indicate patterns in soil spatial relationships.

===Atmosphere===
&lt;!--Differential absorption lider redirects here--&gt;
{{main|Atmospheric lidar}}
Initially based on ruby lasers, lidar for meteorological applications was constructed shortly after the invention of the laser and represent one of the first applications of laser technology. Lidar technology has since expanded vastly in capability and lidar systems are used to perform a range of measurements that include profiling clouds, measuring winds, studying aerosols, and quantifying various atmospheric components. Atmospheric components can in turn provide useful information including surface pressure (by measuring the absorption of oxygen or nitrogen), greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and methane), photosynthesis (carbon dioxide), fires (carbon monoxide), and humidity (water vapor). [[Atmospheric lidar]]s can be either ground-based, airborne or satellite depending on the type of measurement.

Atmospheric lidar remote sensing works in two ways – 
# by measuring backscatter from the atmosphere, and 
# by measuring the scattered reflection off the ground (when the lidar is airborne) or other hard surface.

Backscatter from the atmosphere directly gives a measure of clouds and aerosols. Other derived measurements from backscatter such as winds or cirrus ice crystals require careful selecting of the wavelength and/or polarization detected. ''Doppler lidar'' and ''Rayleigh Doppler lidar'' are used to measure temperature and/or wind speed along the beam by measuring the frequency of the backscattered light. The [[Doppler broadening]] of gases in motion allows the determination of properties via the resulting frequency shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laser-distance-measurer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lecture14.pdf |format=PDF |title=Lecture 14 : Principles of active remote sensing: Lidars and lidar sensing of aerosols, gases and clouds |website=Laser-distance-measurer.com |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | year = 2011 | first1 = T. |title = Middle atmosphere temperature trend and solar cycle revealed by long-term Rayleigh lidar observations |journal = J.

Doppler lidar systems are also now beginning to be successfully applied in the renewable energy sector to acquire wind speed, turbulence, wind veer, and wind shear data. Both pulsed and continuous wave systems are being used. Pulsed systems use signal timing to obtain vertical distance resolution, whereas continuous wave systems rely on detector focusing.

The term, ''eolics'', has been proposed to describe the collaborative and interdisciplinary study of wind using computational fluid mechanics simulations and Doppler lidar measurements.&lt;ref&gt;Clive, P.

The ground reflection of an airborne lidar gives a measure of surface reflectivity (assuming the atmospheric transmittance is well known) at the lidar wavelength, however, the ground reflection is typically used for making absorption measurements of the atmosphere. "Differential absorption lidar" (DIAL) measurements utilize two or more closely spaced (&lt;1&amp;nbsp;nm) wavelengths to factor out surface reflectivity as well as other transmission losses, since these factors are relatively insensitive to wavelength. When tuned to the appropriate absorption lines of a particular gas, DIAL measurements can be used to determine the concentration (mixing ratio) of that particular gas in the atmosphere. This is referred to as an ''Integrated Path Differential Absorption'' (IPDA) approach, since it is a measure of the integrated absorption along the entire lidar path. IPDA lidars can be either pulsed&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koch | first1 = Grady J. | last2 = Barnes | first2 = Bruce W | last3 = Petros | first3 = Mulugeta | last4 = Beyon | first4 = Jeffrey Y | last5 = Amzajerdian | first5 = Farzin | last6 = Yu | first6 = Jirong | last7 = Davis | first7 = Richard E | last8 = Ismail | first8 = Syed | last9 = Vay | first9 = Stephanie | last10 = Kavaya | first10 = Michael J | last11 = Singh | first11 = Upendra N | year = 2004| title = Coherent Differential Absorption Lidar Measurements of CO2 | url = | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 43 | issue = 26| pages = 5092–5099 | doi = 10.1364/AO.43.005092 |bibcode = 2004ApOpt..43.5092K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abshire|first=James B.|last2=Ramanathan|first2=Anand|last3=Riris|first3=Haris|last4=Mao|first4=Jianping|last5=Allan|first5=Graham R.|last6=Hasselbrack|first6=William E.|last7=Weaver|first7=Clark J.|last8=Browell|first8=Edward V.|date=2013-12-30|title=Airborne Measurements of CO2 Column Concentration and Range Using a Pulsed Direct-Detection IPDA Lidar|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/6/1/443|journal=Remote Sensing|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=443–469|doi=10.3390/rs6010443|bibcode=2013RemS....6..443A}}&lt;/ref&gt; or CW&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Joel F. | year = 2013| title = Nonlinear swept frequency technique for CO2 measurements using a CW laser system | url = | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 52 | issue = 13| pages = 3100–3107 | doi = 10.1364/AO.52.003100 | pmid = 23669780 |arxiv = 1303.4933 |bibcode = 2013ApOpt..52.3100C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically use two or more wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dobler | first1 = Jeremy T. | last2 = Harrison | first2 = F.

==== Scheimpflug principle ====
Another lidar technique for atmospheric remote sensing has emerged. It is based on [[Scheimpflug principle]], referred to as '''Scheimpflug lidar''' ('''slidar''').

"''The implication of the Scheimpflug principle is that when a laser beam is transmitted into the atmosphere, the backscattering echo of the entire illuminating probe volume is still in focus simultaneously without diminishing the aperture as long as the object plane, image plane and the lens plane intersect with each other''".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A two dimensional CCD/CMOS camera is used to resolve the backscattering echo of the transmitted laser beam.

Thus as in the case of conventional lidar technologies continuous wave light sources such as diode lasers can be employed for remote sensing instead of using complicated nanosecond pulse light sources.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mei|first=Liang|title=Remote sensing of atmospheric aerosol and gas using scheimpflug lidar based on diode lasers|journal=Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS) |isbn=978-1-5090-6094-8|volume=|date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SLidar system is also a robust and inexpensive system based on compact laser diodes and array detectors.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Military===
Few military applications are known to be in place and are classified (such as the lidar-based speed measurement of the [[AGM-129 ACM]] stealth nuclear cruise missile), but a considerable amount of research is underway in their use for imaging. Higher resolution systems collect enough detail to identify targets, such as [[tanks]]. Examples of military applications of lidar include the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) for counter-mine warfare by Areté Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arete.com/index.php?view=stil_mcm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904075643/http://www.arete.com/index.php?view=stil_mcm |date=September 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A NATO report (RTO-TR-SET-098) evaluated the potential technologies to do stand-off detection for the discrimination of biological warfare agents. The potential technologies evaluated were Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR), Differential Scattering (DISC), and Ultraviolet Laser Induced Fluorescence (UV-LIF). The report concluded that : ''Based upon the results of the lidar systems tested and discussed above, the Task Group recommends that the best option for the near-term (2008–2010) application of stand-off detection systems is UV-LIF '',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nato.int/pubs/rdp.asp?RDP=RTO-TR-SET-098 |title=NATO Laser Based Stand-Off Detection of biological Agents |publisher=Rta.nato.int |accessdate=2013-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720141859/http://www.rta.nato.int/pubs/rdp.asp?RDP=RTO-TR-SET-098 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in the long-term, other techniques such as stand-off [[Raman spectroscopy]] may prove to be useful for identification of biological warfare agents.

Short-range compact spectrometric lidar based on Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) would address the presence of bio-threats in aerosol form over critical indoor, semi-enclosed and outdoor venues such as stadiums, subways, and airports. This near real-time capability would enable rapid detection of a bioaerosol release and allow for timely implementation of measures to protect occupants and minimize the extent of contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ino.ca/en-CA/Achievements/Description/project-p/short-range-bioaerosol-threat-detection.html |title=Short-Range Bioaerosol Threat Detection Sensor (SR-BioSpectra) |publisher=Ino.ca |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Water infiltration
Some of these properties have been used to assess the geomechanical quality of the rock mass through the [[Rock mass rating|RMR]] index. Moreover, as the orientations of discontinuities can be extracted using the existing methodologies, it is possible to assess the geomechanical quality of a rock slope through the [[Slope Mass Rating|SMR]] index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riquelme|first=Adrián J.|last2=Tomás|first2=Roberto|last3=Abellán|first3=Antonio|date=2016-04-01|title=Characterization of rock slopes through slope mass rating using 3D point clouds|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1365160915300939|journal=International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences|volume=84|pages=165–176|doi=10.1016/j.ijrmms.2015.12.008|hdl=10045/52313}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the comparison of different 3-D point clouds from a slope acquired at different times allows researchers to study the changes produced on the scene during this time interval as a result of rockfalls or any other landsliding processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abellán | first1 = A. | last2 = Oppikofer | first2 = T. | last3 = Jaboyedoff | first3 = M. | last4 = Rosser | first4 = N.J. | last5 = Lim | first5 = M. | last6 = Lato | first6 = M.J. | year = 2014 | title = Terrestrial laser scanning of rock slope instabilities | url = | journal = [[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]] | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 80–97 | doi = 10.1002/esp.3493 | bibcode = 2014ESPL...39...80A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abellán | first1 = A. | last2 = Vilaplana | first2 = J.M. | last3 = Martínez | first3 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Application of a long-range Terrestrial Laser Scanner to a detailed rockfall study at Vall de Núria (Eastern Pyrenees, Spain) | url = | journal = Engineering Geology | volume = 88 | issue = 3–4| pages = 136–148 | doi = 10.1016/j.enggeo.2006.09.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tomás|first=R.|last2=Abellán|first2=A.|last3=Cano|first3=M.|last4=Riquelme|first4=A.|last5=Tenza-Abril|first5=A.

'''THOR'''

THOR is a laser designed toward measuring Earth's atmospheric conditions. The laser enters a cloud cover&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/category/type/Lidar|title=Lidar {{!}} NASA Airborne Science Program|website=airbornescience.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and measures the thickness of the return halo. The sensor has a fiber optic aperture with a width of 7.5 inches that is used to measure the return light.

===Robotics===
Lidar technology is being used in [[robotics]] for the perception of the environment as well as object classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftas.de/Main/Solutions |title=IfTAS |publisher=Iftas.de |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of lidar technology to provide three-dimensional elevation maps of the terrain, high precision distance to the ground, and approach velocity can enable safe landing of robotic and manned vehicles with a high degree of precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Amzajerdian, Farzin |author2=Pierrottet, Diego F. |author3=Petway, Larry B. |author4=Hines, Glenn D. |author5=Roback, Vincent E. |title=Lidar Systems for Precision Navigation and Safe Landing on Planetary Bodies|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20110012163|website=Langley Research Center|publisher=NTRS|accessdate=May 24, 2011|date=2011-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lidar are also widely used in robotics for [[simultaneous localization and mapping]] and well integrated into robot simulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/lidar-sensors |title=Lidar simulation models in Webots|accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refer to the Military section above for further examples.

===Spaceflight===
Lidar is increasingly being utilized for [[Situation awareness|rangefinding]] and [[orbital element]] calculation of [[relative velocity]] in [[proximity operations]] and [[orbital stationkeeping|stationkeeping]] of [[spacecraft]]. Lidar has also been used for [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] studies from space. Short pulses of laser light beamed from a spacecraft can reflect off of tiny particles in the atmosphere and back to a telescope aligned with the spacecraft laser. By precisely timing the lidar 'echo,' and by measuring how much laser light is received by the telescope, scientists can accurately determine the location, distribution and nature of the particles. The result is a revolutionary new tool for studying constituents in the atmosphere, from cloud droplets to industrial pollutants, which are difficult to detect by other means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/LITE.html |title=NASA – Lidar In-space Technology Experiment (LITE) |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=D.M.

===Surveying===
[[File:Mapping van tomtom with five lidars.jpg|thumb|This [[TomTom]] mapping van is fitted with five lidars on its roof rack.]]
Airborne lidar sensors are used by companies in the remote sensing field. They can be used to create a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) or DEM ([[Digital Elevation Model]]); this is quite a common practice for larger areas as a plane can acquire 3–4&amp;nbsp;km wide swaths in a single flyover. Greater vertical accuracy of below 50&amp;nbsp;mm can be achieved with a lower flyover, even in forests, where it is able to give the height of the canopy as well as the ground elevation. Typically, a GNSS receiver configured over a georeferenced control point is needed to link the data in with the [[World Geodetic System|WGS]] ([[World Geodetic System]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Maritime Laser Scanning as the Source for Spatial Data|url = http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/pomr.2015.22.issue-4/pomr-2015-0064/pomr-2015-0064.xml|journal = Polish Maritime Research|volume = 22|issue = 4|pages = 9–14|doi = 10.1515/pomr-2015-0064|first = Jakub|last = Szulwic|first2 = Paweł|last2 = Burdziakowski|first3 = Artur|last3 = Janowski|first4 = Marek|last4 = Przyborski|first5 = Paweł|last5 = Tysiąc|first6 = Aleksander|last6 = Wojtowicz|first7 = Arthem|last7 = Kholodkov|first8 = Krzysztof|last8 = Matysik|first9 = Maciej|last9 = Matysik|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LiDAR are also in use in [[hydrographic survey]]ing. Depending upon the clarity of the water LiDAR can measure depths from 0.9m to 40m with a vertical accuracy of 15&amp;nbsp;cm and horizontal accuracy of 2.5m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://home.iitk.ac.in/~blohani/LiDAR_Tutorial/Bathymetric%20LiDAR.htm|title=Bathymetric LiDAR|last=|first=|date=|website=home.iitk.ac.in|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Forestry&lt;/big&gt;'''

Lidar systems have also been applied to improve forestry management.&lt;ref name="WulderBater2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wulder|first1=Michael A|last2=Bater|first2=Christopher W|last3=Coops|first3=Nicholas C|last4=Hilker|first4=Thomas|last5=White|first5=Joanne C|title=The role of LiDAR in  sustainable forest management|journal=The Forestry Chronicle|volume=84|issue=6|year=2008|pages=807–826|issn=0015-7546|doi=10.5558/tfc84807-6|citeseerx=10.1.1.728.1314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements are used to take inventory in forest plots as well as calculate individual tree heights, crown width and crown diameter. Other statistical analysis use lidar data to estimate total plot information such as canopy volume, mean, minimum and maximum heights, and vegetation cover estimates.

===Transport===
Lidar has been used in the railroad industry to generate asset health reports for asset management and by departments of transportation to assess their road conditions. CivilMaps.com is a leading company in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://civilmaps.com/accelerating-road-and-pavement-condition-surveys-processing-implications/ |title=CivilMaps.com accelerating road and pavement condition surveys |publisher=Civil Maps |date=2015-03-15 |accessdate=2015-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111907/http://civilmaps.com/accelerating-road-and-pavement-condition-surveys-processing-implications/ |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lidar has been used in [[Adaptive Cruise Control|adaptive cruise control]] (ACC) systems for automobiles. Systems such as those by Siemens, Hella, and Cepton use a lidar device mounted on the front of the vehicle, such as the bumper, to monitor the distance between the vehicle and any vehicle in front of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070218131830.htm |title=Bumper-mounted lasers |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event the vehicle in front slows down or is too close, the ACC applies the brakes to slow the vehicle. When the road ahead is clear, the ACC allows the vehicle to accelerate to a speed preset by the driver. Refer to the Military section above for further examples. A lidar-based device, the [[Ceilometer]] is used at airports worldwide to measure the height of clouds on runway approach paths.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Video games===
Recent simulation racing games such as [[iRacing]], [[Assetto Corsa]] and [[Project CARS]] increasingly feature race tracks reproduced from 3-D point clouds acquired through Lidar surveys, resulting in surfaces replicated with millimeter precision in the in-game 3-D environment.

The 2017 exploration game ''Scanner Sombre'', by [[Introversion Software]], uses Lidar as a fundamental game mechanic.

===Other uses===
The video for the song "[[House of Cards (Radiohead song)|House of Cards]]" by [[Radiohead]] was believed to be the first use of real-time 3-D laser scanning to record a music video. The range data in the video is not completely from a lidar, as structured light scanning is also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativity-online.com/?action=news:article&amp;newsId=129514&amp;sectionId=behind_the_work|author=Nick Parish|title=From OK Computer to Roll computer: Radiohead and director James Frost make a video without cameras|publisher=Creativity|date=2008-07-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717184531/http://creativity-online.com/?action=news:article&amp;newsId=129514&amp;sectionId=behind_the_work|archivedate=2008-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative technologies==
{{further|3-D scanner}}
Recent development of [[Structure from motion|Structure From Motion]] (SFM) technologies allows delivering 3-D images and maps based on data extracted from visual and IR photography. The elevation or 3-D data is extracted using multiple parallel passes over mapped area, yielding both visual light images and 3-D structure from the same sensor, which is often a specially chosen and calibrated digital camera. {{citation_needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="218141">The following is a '''list of [[7400-series integrated circuits|7400-series]] [[Logic gate|digital logic]] [[integrated circuit]]s'''. The original [[7400-series integrated circuits]] were made by [[Texas Instruments]] with the prefix "SN" to create the name SN74xx. Due to the popularity of these parts, other manufacturers have released pin-to-pin compatible devices which kept the 7400 sequence number as an aid to identification of compatible parts.  However, different manufacturers will use different prefixes or no prefix at all.

==Overview==

Some TTL logic parts were made with an extended military-specification temperature range. These parts are prefixed with '''54''' instead of '''74''' in the part number. A short-lived '''64''' prefix on Texas Instruments parts indicated an industrial temperature range; this prefix had been dropped from the TI literature by 1973.  Most recent 7400 series parts are fabricated in [[CMOS]] or [[BiCMOS]] technology rather than TTL.  Surface mount parts with a single gate (often in a 5-pin or 6-pin package) are prefixed with '''741G''' instead of '''74'''.

Some manufacturers released some [[4000-series integrated circuits|4000-series]] equivalent CMOS circuits with a 74 prefix, for example the 74HC4066 was a replacement for the 4066 with slightly different electrical characteristics (different power supply voltage ratings, higher frequency capabilities, lower "on" resistances in analog switches, etc.). See [[List of 4000-series integrated circuits]].
Conversely, the 4000-series has "borrowed" from the 7400 series - such as the CD40193 and CD40161 being pin-for-pin ''functional'' replacements for 74C193 and 74C161.

Older TTL parts made by manufacturers such as [[Signetics]], [[Motorola]], [[Mullard]] and [[Siemens]] may have different numeric prefix and numbering series entirely, such as in the European FJ family FJH101 is an 8-input [[NAND gate]] like a 7430.

A few alphabetic characters to designate a specific [[7400-series integrated circuits#Families|logic subfamily]] may immediately follow the '''74''' or '''54''' in the
part number, e.g., 74LS74 for Low-power [[Schottky diode|Schottky]].  Some CMOS parts such as 74HCT74 for High-speed [[CMOS]] with TTL-compatible input thresholds are functionally similar to the TTL part.  Not all functions are available in all families.

In a few instances, such as the 7478 and 74107, the same suffix in different families do not have completely equivalent logic functions.

Another extension to the series is the '''7416xxx''' variant, representing mostly the 16-bit wide counterpart of otherwise 8-bit-wide "base" chips with the same three ending digits. Thus e.g. a "7416373" would be the 16-bit-wide equivalent of a "74373". Some 7416xxx parts, however, do not have a direct counterpart from the standard 74xxx range but deliver new functionality instead, which needs making use of the 7416xxx series' higher pin count. For more details, refer primarily to the Texas Instruments documentation mentioned in the References section.

For CMOS (AC, HC, etc.) subfamilies, read "open drain" for "[[open collector]]" in the table below.

There are a few numeric suffixes that have multiple conflicting assignments, such as the 74453.

==Larger footprints==
Parts in this section have a pin count of 14 pins or more.  The lower part numbers were established in the 1960s and 1970s, then higher part numbers were added incrementally over decades.  IC manufacturers continue to make a core subset of this group, but many of these part numbers are considered obsolete and no longer manufactured.  Older discontinued parts may be available from a limited number of sellers as [[new old stock]] (NOS), though some are much harder to find.

For the following table:
* Part number column - the "x" is a place holder for the [[7400-series integrated circuits#Families|logic subfamily]] name. For example, 74x00 in "LS" logic family would be "74LS00".
* Description column - the terms schmitt-trigger, open-collector/open-drain, three-state were moved to the input and output columns to make it easier to sort by those features.
* Input column - a blank cell means a normal input for the logic family type.
* Output column - a blank cell means a 'totem pole' output, also known as a [[push–pull output]], with the ability to drive ten standard inputs of the same logic subfamily ([[fan-out]] N&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;=10). Outputs with higher output currents are often called drivers or buffers.
* Pins column - number of pins for the [[dual in-line package]] version; a number in brackets indicates that there is no known dual in-line package version of this IC

==Smaller footprints==
As board designs have migrated away from large amounts of logic chips, so has the need for many of the same gate in one package.  Since about 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fairchild Division of National Semiconductor Introduces Industry's Fastest 5V Single-Gate Logic |url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980512215641/http://fairchildsemi.com:80/news/1996/9611/dm96001dl.html |publisher=[[Fairchild Semiconductor]] |accessdate=July 27, 2018 |date=November 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been an ongoing trend towards one / two / three logic gates per chip.  Now logic can be placed where it is physically needed on a board, instead of running long signal traces to a full-size logic chip that has many of the same gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unique and Novel Uses for ON Semiconductor's New One-Gate family |url=http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/AND8018-D.PDF |publisher=[[ON Semiconductor]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010709003217/http://www.onsemi.com:80/pub/Collateral/AND8018-D.PDF |archivedate=July 9, 2001 |date=June 2000 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All chips in the following sections are available 4 to 12 pin [[Surface-mount technology|surface mount packages]].  The right digits, after the 1G/2G/3G, typically has the same functional features as older legacy chips, except for the multifunctional chips and 4-digit chip numbers which are unique to these newer families.  The "x" in the part number is a place holder for the logic family name. For example, 74x1G14 in "LVC" logic family would be "74LVC1G14".  The previously stated prefixes of "SN-" and "MC-" are used to denote manufacturers, Texas Instruments and ON Semiconductor respectively.&lt;ref name="TI-L-LG"&gt;[http://www.ti.com/lit/sg/scyt129g/scyt129g.pdf 2018 Little Logic Guide; Texas Instruments.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NXP-AUP-LG"&gt;[https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/brochure/75017458.pdf 74AUP Logic Guide; NXP.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NXP-LVC-LG"&gt;[https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/brochure/75017668.pdf 74LVC Logic Guide; NXP.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the manufacturers that make these smaller IC chips are: [[Diodes Incorporated]], [[Nexperia]] ([[NXP Semiconductors]]), [[ON Semiconductor]] ([[Fairchild Semiconductor]]), [[Texas Instruments]] ([[National Semiconductor]]), [[Toshiba]].

===One gate chips===
All chips in this section have one gate, noted by the "1G" in the part numbers.  The most popular [[7400 series#7400 series derivative families|logic families]] are LVC and AUP, however there have been other releases such as AUC and AXP families with shorter propagation delays or expansions of the existing families such as the AHC(T) and HC(T).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2855">'''Load dump''' means the disconnection of a powered load. It can cause 2 problems: 
* failure of supply to equipment or customers
* large voltage spikes from the inductive generator(s)

In [[automotive electronics]], it refers to the disconnection of the [[vehicle battery]] from the [[alternator]] while the battery is being charged. Due to such a disconnection of the battery, other loads connected to the alternator see a surge in power line. The peak voltage of this surge may be as high as 120 V and the surge may take up to 400 ms to decay. It is typically clamped to 40 V in 12 V vehicles and about 60 V in 24 V systems.

== Overview ==
The windings of an alternator have a large [[inductance]]. When the vehicle battery is being charged, the alternator supplies it with a large current, the magnitude of which is controlled by the current in the field winding. If the battery becomes disconnected while it is being charged the alternator load suddenly decreases. However the alternator's regulator cannot quickly cause the field current to decrease sufficiently, so the alternator continues to generate a large current. This large current causes the voltage on the vehicle bus to increase significantly -- well above the normal and regulated level.

All the loads connected to the alternator see this high voltage spike. The strength of the spike depends on many factors including the speed at which the alternator is rotating and the current which was being supplied to the battery before it was disconnected. These spike may peak at as high as 120 V and may take up to 400 ms to decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/snva681a/snva681a.pdf |title=Load Dump and Cranking Protection for Automotive Backlight LED Power Supply |publisher=Texas Instruments |date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of a spike would damage many semiconductor devices, e.g. [[Electronic control unit|ECUs]], that may be connected to the alternator. Special protection devices, such as [[Transient voltage suppression diode|TVS diodes]], [[varistors]] which can withstand and absorb the energy of these spikes may be added to protect such semiconductor devices.

Various automotive standards such as [[ISO 7637-2]] and [http://www.sae.org/technical/standards/J1113/11_200706  SAE J1113-11] specify a standard shape of the load dump pulse against which automotive electronic components may be designed.

There can also be a smaller inductive spike due to the inductance of the stator windings. That may have a larger voltage, but it will be for a much shorter duration, as relatively little energy is stored in the inductance of these windings. Load dump can be more damaging because the alternator continues to generate power until the field current can decrease, so much more energy can be released.

[[File:MopWringer-45.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]

A '''mop bucket cart''' (or '''mop trolley''') is a wheeled [[bucket]] that allows its user to wring out a wet [[mop]] without getting the hands dirty. The cart has two buckets with the upper one usually clipped onto the lower.

The upper bucket is used to place the wet mop for storage and press handle to wring out the mop. Water trickles down to another bucket below, which collects the [[Greywater|waste water]]. In some carts, there are separate lower front bucket to collect waste water. The smaller lower rear bucket is filled with a [[floor cleaning]] solution.

Wheels are usually present to allow the user to push the cart around using the wring handle bar to steer, allowing complete mobility.

These carts are usually made of heavy duty plastic and usually found in institutional, commercial or industrial settings, but can be used in the home as a more convenient and less dirty tool for cleaning floors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5066">'''Nanoneedles''' may be conical or tubular needles in the [[nanometre]] size range, made from silicon or boron-nitride with a central bore of sufficient size to allow the passage of large molecules, or solid needles useful in [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[light emitting diodes]] (LED) and [[laser diodes]].

==Usage==

===Impalefection===
{{main|Impalefection}}
In 2005 the Research Institute for Cell Engineering at Japan's [[National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology]] (AIST) and [[Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology]] used nanoneedles controlled by an [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM) to penetrate the nucleus of living cells and insert molecules of nucleic acid, proteins or possibly to carry out cell surgery. The technique can accurately establish the position of the needle by monitoring the force exerted. Cells to be used for tracking, diagnosing, and treatment of illness may be removed from the body and replaced after being injected. The 100 [[nanometer|nm]] diameter needles were cut from silicon AFM tips using focused [[ion beam etching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nanoscale operation of a living cell using an atomic force microscope with a nanoneedle.|last1=Obataya |first1=I|last2= Nakamura |first2=C|last3=Han |first3=S|last4=Nakamura |first4=N|last5=Miyake |first5=J|journal=Nanotechnology Letters|volume=5|issue=1|date=January 2005|pages=27–30|pmid=15792407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, researchers at the [[University of Illinois]] produced a 50&amp;nbsp;nm diameter boron-nitride nanoneedle with a thin coating of gold, suitable for biophysical research. Its diameter allows easy penetration of cell walls in order to deliver organic matter or fluorescent [[quantum dots]] into the cytoplasm or the nucleus. It may also be used as electrochemical probe or optical [[biosensor]] in a cellular environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here comes the nanoneedle--can you see it?|first1=Dong|last1=Ngo|publisher=Cnet|date=28 April 2009|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/here-comes-the-nanoneedle-can-you-see-it/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atomic Force Microscopy===
The [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 2008 produced [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) nanoneedles which emit extremely bright light, though [[Lasing threshold|not yet lasers]], when [[Optical pumping|optically pumped]]. With a length of 3-4 micrometres, they taper to tips of 2-5&amp;nbsp;nm across. In addition to [[optoelectronic]] devices, the needles will be useful in atomic force microscopy (AFM), and can be easily grown in arrays. Such AFM arrays, besides producing near-atomic resolution images of surfaces, could lead to new forms of data storage by direct manipulation of atoms. The needles may also find a use in tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, a process in which molecular energy levels are measured by comparing the frequency of incident light with that of outgoing light. A sharp needle tip allows for a more precise examination of the sample, down perhaps to that of single molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photoluminescence In Nano-needles|publisher=ScienceDaily|date=23 April 2008|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080422160243.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomedical Research===
Research at the department of NanoMedicine and Biomedical Engineering at the [[University of Texas]] in 2010 created a new type of nanoneedle using silicon. A solution of [[hydrogen peroxide]] produces porous needles - their porosity is controlled along their length by altering the concentration of peroxide over time. The coloured porous needles are constructed to biodegrade over a predictable period, and have a surface area 120 times that of equivalent solid wires, making them useful as drug-delivery vehicles. Since porous silicon does not harm cells, the needles may also be used to tag cells and monitor chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The (nano)grass is greener: Porous silicon nanoneedles for your health|date=2 August 2010|publisher=nanowerk|url=https://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=17459.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical considerations==
A note of caution was sounded by Martin A. Philbert, professor of [[toxicology]] at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]]. ''"The ability to manipulate nanometer-scale materials at the molecular level holds the promise of conferring specificity of cellular delivery and the reduction of collateral nuisance injury to neighboring cells. In the context of environmental health, the scientific community will have to pay close attention to those physicochemical properties of engineered nanomaterials that defeat or circumvent normal cellular processes and lend themselves to indiscriminate penetration of biological barriers, tissues, and cellular systems."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nanoneedles Pierce Cells|first1=Michael|last1=Freemantle|publisher=Chemical and Engineering News|date=31 January 2007|url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/85/web/2007/01/Nanoneedles-Pierce-Cells.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In agriculture, a '''pulper''' is a machine designed to remove pulp (I.e. the soft flesh from [[agriculture|agricultural]] produce).  For example, in [[coffee]] growing the ripe, red [[Cherry|cherries]] are picked from the coffee bushes and prior to [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] and later drying the soft pulp needs to be removed (otherwise a potentially uncontrollable fermentation/rot will occur).  In the case of coffee the pulping is normally done in a pulper that is either hand-cranked or engine-driven; the beans are emptied into an elevated [[Chute (gravity)|hopper]] and then dropped through a narrow slot within which they come into contact with a rotating spiked drum that removes the pulp or flesh.  Again in the case of coffee, the sticky beans that result from this process then have to be washed, fermented, washed again and dried prior to further processing (milling to remove the [[parchment]]) and then roasting.

In [[paper]] making, a pulper is a machine that produces pulp from cellulose fibres; this pulp can directly be used by a [[paper machine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pulppapermill.com/pulper/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Post-consumer waste]] is re-pulped, in one of the processes involved in [[recycling]] it.

[[File:Husqvarna Automower 308 with track marks in lawn.jpg|thumb|A robotic lawn mower with visible track marks in a lawn indicating the random way it cuts the grass.]]
A '''robotic lawn mower''' is an [[autonomous robot]] used to cut [[lawn]] grass.  A typical [[robotic]] lawn mower (in particular earlier generation models) requires the user to set up a border wire around the lawn that defines the area to be mowed. The robot uses this wire to locate the boundary of the area to be trimmed and in some cases to locate a recharging dock. Robotic mowers are capable of maintaining up to {{convert|30000|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} of grass.

Robotic lawn mowers are increasingly sophisticated, are self-docking and some contain [[rain sensor]]s if necessary, nearly eliminating human interaction.  Robotic [[lawn mower]]s represented the second largest category of [[domestic robot]]s used by the end of 2005.

Possibly the first commercial robotic lawn mower was the MowBot, introduced and patented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-propelled random motion lawnmower |url=http://www.google.ca/patents?id=tEA0AAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1969-10-20|accessdate=2013-06-08}} {{US Patent|3698523}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969 and already showing many features of today's most popular products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MowBot (Jan, 1969) |url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/mowbot/|date=2011-10-14|accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the growth of robotic lawn mower sales was 15 times that of the traditional styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rise of the Lawn-Cutting Machines |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-25/rise-of-the-lawn-cutting-machines|date=2012-10-25|accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the emergence of smart phones some robotic mowers have integrated features within custom apps to adjust settings or scheduled mowing times and frequency, as well as manually control the mower with a digital joystick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Best Robot Lawn Mower On The Market |url=http://www.beststuff.com/gadgets/robomow-rs630-review-best-robot-lawn-mower/28881/|date=2014-05-09|accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern robotic lawn mowers can contain specialized sensors, allowing them to automatically mow around obstacles or even go to sleep when it starts to rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A CUT ABOVE THE REST: THE 5 BEST ROBOTIC LAWN MOWERS

== Technology ==
In 1995, the first fully [[solar power]]ed robotic mower became available.

The mower can find its [[charging station]] via [[radio frequency]] emissions, by following a boundary wire, or by following an optional guide wire.  This can eliminate wear patterns in the lawn caused by the mower only being able to follow one wire back to the station.

To get to remote areas or areas only accessible through narrow passages the mower can follow a guide wire or a boundary wire out of the station.

Batteries used include [[Nickel–metal hydride battery|nickel–metal hydride]] (NiMH), [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] and [[Lead–acid battery|lead-acid]].

'''Royale''' is a Canadian brand of consumer household paper products such as [[facial tissue]], [[bathroom tissue]], [[paper towel]], and paper [[napkins]].

== History ==
In 1929, [[New York City|New York]]-based National Cellulose Company dissolved a relationship with its Canadian distributor and opened its first Canadian office in downtown [[Toronto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=50 Years of Kitten-y Softness|date=2013|publisher=Irving Tissue Corporation|location=Dieppe|isbn=978-1-77136-236-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Toronto businessman William S. Gibson and a team of investors bought out National Cellulose and Dominion Cellulose was formed.  Dominion Cellulose continued to sell its Facelle tissue in Canada until 1961 when the company was sold to [[Canadian International Paper Company]] and was renamed Facelle Company. Facelle Company launched its Royale brand in 1963 with two products; 3-ply facial tissue, and 2-ply bathroom tissue.

In August 1991 the Royale brand was sold to [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] where it remained until 2001 when [[Irving Tissue]] purchased P&amp;G’s Weston Road plant in Toronto, Ontario along with the rights to the Royale brand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulpandpaperonline.com/doc/irving-tissue-purchases-toronto-plant-from-pr-0001 Irving Tissue purchases Toronto plant from Proctor and Gamble&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729031534/http://www.pulpandpaperonline.com/doc/irving-tissue-purchases-toronto-plant-from-pr-0001 |date=2014-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Royale Kittens ==

The Royale brand is represented by the Royale Kittens, two white [[Persian (cat)|Persian]] kittens who embody the Kitten-y softness of Royale products. They first appeared in a 1973 television commercial which ran until 1984. Since then, the Kittens have appeared in television, print, and Internet marketing material for Royale. In 2010, an official [[Facebook]] community page was created in the name of the Royale Kittens.

== Advertising ==

Royale’s longest running television ad campaign ran from 1973 to 1984, and featured the Royale Kittens playing on a white shag rug and unwinding rolls of bathroom tissue. Other memorable campaigns include Royale’s “The Nose” spot featuring pro hockey player [[Eddie Shack]].

'''STS relay''' is the speech-to-speech relay service available to any telephone callers or callees with [[speech disability]] and to those who wish to [[Speech communication|talk]] with them.

==In the US==
''STS Relay'' is available via 711 in the US through the [[Telecommunications Relay Service]]; in a telephone call, first dial 711, then ask for STS. A trained communication assistant will ask you what number you want to call. The assistant will repeat what the caller with the speech disability is saying. The callee can then respond. The caller can then reply. The communication assistant will ''revoice'' the caller's message. The callee then responds in this three-way assisted phone conversation.

==In other countries==
The service is available in Australia, [[Sweden]], and in other nations on a trial basis. STS Relay on the [[PSTN]] (public switch telephone network) is available for those who need telephone call assistance because of a speech disability.

==History==
STS Relay first became available in the US in California, in 1997; the service became available nationally March 1, 2001.

On May 12, 2006, the [[University of Wisconsin - Madison]] awarded Robert Z. Segalman, PhD (UW 1972), an honorary [[Doctor of Science]] for his work in creating Speech To Speech.

A '''Signal Transfer Point''' (STP) is a router that relays [[Signaling System 7|SS7]] messages between ''signaling end-points'' [[Signaling End Point|(SEPs)]] and other signaling transfer points (STPs). Typical SEPs include ''service switching points'' [[Service switching point|(SSPs)]] and ''service control points'' [[Service Control Point|(SCPs)]]. The STP is connected to adjacent SEPs and STPs via [[Signaling System 7|signaling links]]. Based on the address fields of the SS7 messages, the STP routes the messages to the appropriate outgoing signaling link. [[Edge STP]]s can also route based upon message body content using [[deep packet inspection]] techniques, and can provide address translations and screen content to limit the transfer of messages with dubious content or sent from unreliable sources. To meet stringent reliability requirements, STPs are typically provisioned in mated pairs.

These 'routers' are connected just by signaling links; they don't have users attached (where a ''user'' could be a  [[mobile station]] (MS), a [[PSTN]] user in case of a public terrestrial network, or a piece of  [[terminal equipment]] at the end of an [[ISDN B channel]]). SEPs send signaling messages to other SEPs, but the messages are normally routed via the SEP's adjacent STPs. An STP's main function is to identify the best path for two SEPs to communicate. A typical application would be for two SEPs to agree on the use of a shared data path (e.g., using [[ISDN User Part|ISUP]] to initiate a voice call between a user on one SEP and a user on the second SEP). In this way, STPs route signaling messages (for starting, maintaining or finishing any kind of calls originated by the SEPs' attached users) while avoiding disabled intermediary STPs.

A signaling message typically never goes directly from a given SEP to the destination SEP: the message would normally have to pass through the initiating SEP's adjacent STP so that it can be routed to the destination SEP. In some applications, however, SEPs might be directly connected with signaling links; this would typically be done to enhance robustness or performance between two critical SEPs. Such mesh network configurations are also common in Europe, where STPs have not found widespread deployment{{citation needed|reason='This is a dubious statement. It seems to be widely used in our company.'|date=December 2014}}.

In some cases, signaling messages can be originated by the STP to learn about the state of the signaling network Some examples include:
* an STP may send route set test messages to probe the availability of a particular SEP;
* it may send low-level [[Message Transfer Part|MTP]] messages to an adjacent signaling point to check the Bit Error Rate (BER) on a particular signaling link; or
* it may let other adjacent signaling points know that it is going to out of service; in this way, the adjacent signaling points will try to avoid this [[Out-of-service|OOS]] STP.

A given piece of equipment can implement both SEP and STP functionality. This is commonly done in some [[Service switching point|SSPs]]. This is also seen in [[Signaling gateway|Signaling Gateways]] that also have [[Application server|Application Server (AS)]] functionality as defined by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]].

Some [[UMTS]] [[Mobile number portability|number portability]] solutions are implemented in STPs. In [[UMTS]], the STP provides [[Global Title|Global Title Translation]] (GTT), which may be used to route queries from a gateway [[Mobile Switching Center|MSC]] ([[GMSC]]) to the [[Home Location Register|HLR]]. Note that for every call to an MS, the call is first routed to the MS's Gateway MSC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10207">'''Sound and music computing''' ('''SMC''') is a research field that studies the whole [[sound]] and [[music]] communication chain from a [[multidisciplinary]] point of view. By combining scientific, technological and artistic methodologies it aims at understanding, modeling and generating sound and music through computational approaches.

==History==

The Sound and Music Computing research field can be traced back to the 1950s, when a few experimental composers, together with some engineers and scientists, independently and in different parts of the world, began exploring the use of the new digital technologies for music applications. Since then the SMC research field has had a fruitful history and different terms have been used to identify it. [[Computer Music]] and [[Music Technology]] might be the terms that have been used the most, being Sound and Music Computing a more recent term. The research community established in 1974 the [[International Computer Music Association]] and the [[International Computer Music Conference]]. In 1977 the [[Computer Music Journal]] was established. The [[CCRMA|Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA)]] at [[Stanford University]] was created in the early 1970s and the [[IRCAM|Institute for Research and Coordination Acoustic/Music (IRCAM)]] in [[Paris]] in the late 1970s.

The Sound and Music Computing term was first proposed in the mid 1990s &lt;ref name="camurri95" /&gt; and it was included in the [[ACM Computing Classification System]]. Using this name, in 2004 the [[Sound and Music Computing Conference]] was started and also in 2004 a roadmapping initiative was funded by the [[European Commission]] that resulted on the SMC Roadmap &lt;ref name="smcroadmapv1" /&gt; and on the [[Sound and Music Computing Conference#The SMC Summer School|Sound and Music Computing Summer School]].

Given the increasing research specialization within the SMC field a number of focused conferences have been created. Particularly relevant are the [[International Conference on Digital Audio Effects]], established in 1998, the [[International Society for Music Information Retrieval|International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR)]], established in 2000, and the [[New Interfaces for Musical Expression|International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)]], established in 2001.

==Subfields==

The current SMC research field can be grouped into a number of subfields that focus on specific aspects of the sound and music communication chain.

* ''Processing of sound and music signals'': This subfield focuses on [[audio signal processing]] techniques for the analysis, transformation and resynthesis of sound and music signals.
* ''Understanding and modeling sound and music'': This subfield focuses on understanding and modeling sound and music using computational approaches. Here we can include [[Computational musicology]], [[Music information retrieval]], and the more computational approaches of [[Music cognition]].
* ''Interfaces for sound and music'': This subfield focuses on the design and implementation of computer interfaces for sound and music. This is basically related to [[Human Computer Interaction]].
* ''Assisted sound and music creation'': This subfield focuses on the development of computer tools for assisting [[Sound design]] and [[Music composition]]. Here we can include traditional fields like [[Algorithmic composition]].

==Areas of application==

SMC research is a field driven by applications. Examples of applications are:

* ''Digital music instruments'': This application focuses on musical sound generation and processing devices. It encompasses simulation of traditional instruments, transformation of sound in recording studios or at live performances and musical interfaces for augmented or collaborative instruments.
* ''Music production'': This application domain focuses on technologies and tools for music composition. Applications range from music modeling and generation to tools for music post–production and audio editing.
* ''Music information retrieval'': This application domain focuses on retrieval technologies for music (both audio and symbolic data). Applications range from music audio–identification and broadcast monitoring to higher–level semantic descriptions and all associated tools for search and retrieval.
* ''Digital music libraries'': This application places particular emphasis on preservation, conservation and archiving and the integration of musical audio content and meta–data descriptions, with a focus on ﬂexible access. Applications range from large distributed libraries to mobile access platforms.
* ''Interactive multimedia systems'': These are for use in everyday appliances and in artistic and entertainment applications. They aim to facilitate music–related human–machine interaction involving various modalities of action and perception (e.g. auditory, visual, olfactory, tactile, haptic, and all kinds of body movements) which can be captured through the use of audio/visual, kinematic and bioparametric (skin conduction, temperature) devices.
* ''Auditory interfaces'': These include all applications where non–verbal sound is employed in the communication channel between the user and the computing device. Auditory displays are used in applications and objects that require monitoring of some type of information. [[Sonification]] is used as a method for data display in a wide range of application domains where auditory inspection, analysis and summarisation can be more efficient than traditional visual display. [[Sonic interaction design]] emphasizes the role of sound in interactive contexts.
* ''Augmented action and perception'': This refers to tools that increase the normal action and perception capabilities of humans. The system adds virtual information to a user’s sensory perception by merging real images, sounds, and haptic sensation with virtual ones. This has the effect of augmenting the user’s sense of presence, and of making possible a symbiosis between her view of the world and the computer interface. Possible applications are in the medical domain, manufacturing and repair, entertainment, annotation and visualization, and robot tele-operation.

A '''system administrator''', or '''sysadmin''', is a person who is responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of [[computer systems]]; especially [[multi-user]] computers, such as [[Server (computing)|servers]]. The system administrator seeks to ensure that the [[uptime]], [[Computer performance|performance]], [[System resource|resources]], and [[Computer security|security]] of the computers they manage meet the needs of the [[User (computing)|users]], without exceeding a set [[budget]] when doing so.

To meet these needs, a system administrator may acquire, install, or [[upgrade]] computer components and software; provide routine automation; maintain security policies; [[troubleshoot]]; train or supervise staff; or offer [[technical support]] for projects.

==Related fields==
Many organizations staff other jobs related to system administration. In a larger company, these may all be separate positions within a computer support or Information Services (IS) department. In a smaller group they may be shared by a few sysadmins, or even a single person.

* A [[database administrator]] (DBA) maintains a [[database]] system, and is responsible for the integrity of the data and the efficiency and performance of the system.
* A [[network administrator]] maintains network infrastructure such as [[network switch|switches]] and [[network router|router]]s, and diagnoses problems with these or with the behavior of network-attached computers.
* A [[computer security|security administrator]] is a specialist in computer and network security, including the administration of security devices such as firewalls, as well as consulting on general security measures.
* A [[web administrator]] maintains web server services (such as [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] or [[Internet Information Services|IIS]]) that allow for internal or external access to web sites. Tasks include managing multiple sites, administering security, and configuring necessary components and software. Responsibilities may also include software change management.
* A [[computer operator]] performs routine maintenance and upkeep, such as changing backup tapes or replacing failed drives in a [[RAID|redundant array of independent disks]] (RAID). Such tasks usually require physical presence in the room with the computer, and while less skilled than sysadmin tasks, may require a similar level of trust, since the operator has access to possibly sensitive data.

== Training ==
[[File:System Administration Conference Training.jpg|thumb|Training at a system administration conference|alt=A man speaking from a podium to a room of people with laptop computers]]
Most employers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/network-and-computer-systems-administrators.htm#tab-4|title=Network and Computer Systems Administrators :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; require a bachelor's degree in a related field, such as [[computer science]], [[information technology]], [[electronics engineering]], or [[computer engineering]]. Some schools also offer undergraduate degrees and graduate programs in system administration&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssa.rit.edu/~nssa/?q=node/8]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103548/http://nssa.rit.edu/~nssa/?q=node%2F8|date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.unh.edu/bsit.htm B.S. Information Technology | Computer Science]. Cs.unh.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rit.edu/programs/networking-and-systems-administration-0]. Nssa.rit.edu (2013-01-04). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtu.edu/technology/]. mtu.edu.

Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition, because of the practical nature of system administration and the easy availability of [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[Server (computing)|server]] software, many system administrators enter the field self-taught.

Generally, a prospective will be required to have some experience with the computer system they are expected to manage. In some cases, candidates are expected to possess industry certifications such as the Microsoft [[Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator|MCSA]], [[MCSE]], [[MCITP]], Red Hat [[Red Hat Certified Engineer|RHCE]], Novell [[Certified Novell Administrator|CNA]], [[Certified Novell Engineer|CNE]], Cisco [[CCNA]] or [[CompTIA]]'s [[A+ certification|A+]] or [[Network+]], [[Sun Certified]] [[Sun Certified Network Administrator|SCNA]], [[Linux Professional Institute]], Linux Foundation Certified Engineer or Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification]&lt;/ref&gt;, among others.

Sometimes, almost exclusively in smaller sites, the role of system administrator may be given to a skilled user in addition to or in replacement of his or her duties.

== Skills ==
{{hatnote|Some of this section is from the [http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/network-and-computer-systems-administrators.htm Occupational Outlook Handbook], 2010-11 Edition, which is in the [[public domain]] as a [[work of the United States Government]].}}

The ''subject matter'' of system administration includes computer systems and the ways people use them in an organization. This entails a knowledge of [[operating system]]s and [[computer application|application]]s, as well as hardware and software [[troubleshooting]], but also knowledge of the purposes for which people in the organization use the computers.

Perhaps the most important skill for a system administrator is [[problem solving]]—frequently under various sorts of constraints and stress. The sysadmin is on call when a computer system goes down or malfunctions, and must be able to quickly and correctly diagnose what is wrong and how best to fix it.
They may also need to have teamwork and communication skills; as well as being able to install and configure hardware and software.

Sysadmins must understand the behavior of software in order to deploy it and to troubleshoot problems, and generally know several [[programming language]]s used for [[Scripting Language|scripting]] or automation of routine tasks. A typical sysadmin's role is not to design or write new application software but when they are responsible for automating system or application configuration with various configuration management tools, the lines somewhat blur. Depending on the sysadmin's role and skillset they may be expected to understand equivalent key/core concepts a software engineer understands. That said, system administrators are not [[software engineer]]s or [[software development|developer]]s, in the job title sense.

Particularly when dealing with [[Internet]]-facing or business-critical systems, a sysadmin must have a strong grasp of [[computer security]]. This includes not merely deploying software patches, but also preventing break-ins and other security problems with preventive measures. In some organizations, computer security administration is a separate role responsible for overall security and the upkeep of [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]s and [[intrusion detection system]]s, but all sysadmins are generally responsible for the security of computer systems.

==Duties==
A system administrator's responsibilities might include:

* Analyzing [[Computer data logging|system logs]] and identifying potential issues with computer systems.
* Applying [[operating system]] updates, patches, and configuration changes.
* Installing and configuring new [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]].
* Adding, removing, or updating [[user account]] information, resetting [[password]]s, etc.
* Answering technical queries and assisting users.
* Responsibility for [[computer security|security]].
* Responsibility for [[documentation|documenting]] the configuration of the system.
* [[Troubleshooting]] any reported problems.
* System [[performance tuning]].
* Ensuring that the network infrastructure is up and running.
* Configuring, adding, and deleting file systems.
* Ensuring parity between dev, test and production environments.
* Training users
*Plan and manage the machine room environment 
In larger organizations, some of the tasks above may be divided among different system administrators or members of different organizational groups. For example, a dedicated individual(s) may apply all system upgrades, a [[Quality control|Quality Assurance (QA)]] team may perform testing and validation, and one or more [[technical writer]]s may be responsible for all technical documentation written for a company. System administrators, in larger organizations, tend not to be [[systems architect]]s, [[Systems engineering|systems engineers]], or [[systems design]]ers.

In smaller organizations, the system administrator might also act as technical support, [[Database Administrator]], [[Network Administrator]], Storage (SAN) Administrator or [[application analyst]].

A '''taggant''' can mean a [[radio frequency]] [[integrated circuit|microchip]] used in [[automated identification and data capture]] (see [[RFID]]). In such cases, electronic devices use radio waves to track and identify items, such as pharmaceutical products, by assigning individual [[serial number]]s to the containers holding each product. This technology may prevent the diversion or [[counterfeit drugs|counterfeiting of drugs]] by allowing wholesalers and pharmacists to determine the identity and dosage of individual products.

A taggant is also a chemical or physical marker added to materials to allow various forms of testing.  Physical taggants can take many different forms but are typically microscopic in size, included at low levels, and simple to detect.  They can be utilized to differentiate authentic product from counterfeits, provide identifying information for traceability purposes (e.g. lot number, company name), determine mixing homogeneity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microtracers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/B-5-Mix-with-Confidence-1994-7-18-13-ZE.pdf|title=Mix With Confidence|last=Eisenberg|first=David|date=June 1994|website=|publisher=International Milling Flour &amp; Feed|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-contamination,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microtracers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/C-3-Validating-cross-contamination-control-2007-7-18-13-ZE.pdf|title=Validating Cross-Contamination Control|last=Eisenberg|first=David|date=September 2006|website=Feed Industry Network|publisher=Watt Publishing|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to detect dilution of proprietary products.  Taggants are known to be widely used in the animal feed industry, plastics, inks, sheet and flexible [[explosives]], and pharmaceuticals.

A [[software taggant]] is a cryptographic signature added to software that enables positive origin identification and integrity of programs. Software taggants use standard PKI techniques (see [[public key infrastructure]]) and were introduced by the [[Industry Connections Security Group]] of [[IEEE]] in an attempt to control proliferation of [[malware]] obfuscation via [[executable compression]].

==History of taggants==
The word 'taggant' originates from the trademarked name [https://www.microtracesolutions.com/solutions/implement-independently/microtaggant-identification-particles "Microtaggant Identification Particles".]  Microtaggants were originally developed by 3M for the post detonation of explosives.  In 1985, Microtrace, LLC acquired the technology and began to utilize Microtaggants for anti-counterfeiting and brand protection.  Since 1985, the word 'taggant' has become widely utilized and refers to multiple variations.

==Explosive taggants==

There are two types of taggant which have been considered for use with explosives.  One is to help detect the presence of a [[bomb]] in, for example, [[airport]] screening of [[luggage]]; and the other to assist the [[police]] in identifying the explosive after the [[detonation]] of such a bomb.

===Detection taggants===

These are [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[chemical]]s which will slowly [[evaporate]] from the explosive and can be detected in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by either [[detection dog]]s or specialised machines.  They are intended to enhance the detectability of the explosive by instruments or animals thus revealing the presence of a bomb containing the explosive to be [[explosive detection|detected]]. Although various technologies exist to detect untagged explosives, detection taggants help to increase their reliability.  The inclusion of detection taggants in explosives is mandatory in some countries.  Following the bombing of PanAm 103 over Scotland, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was instrumental in effecting a worldwide requirement for placing a detection taggant in plastic bonded explosives.

There is a choice between four possible detection taggant chemicals which must be added to [[plastic explosive]]s under the 1991 [[International Civil Aviation Organization]]'s [[Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection]]. In the [[United States]] the marker is always 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane, usually called [[DMDNB]] or DMNB. [[Dog]]s are very sensitive to it and can detect as little as 0.5 parts per billion in the air, as can specialised [[ion mobility spectrometer]]s. Other taggants in use are [[ethylene glycol dinitrate]], known as EGDN and used to mark [[Semtex]], ortho-[[mononitrotoluene]] (o-MNT), and para-mononitrotoluene (p-MNT).

===Identification (or post detonation) taggants===

These have been considered for introduction in industrial explosives so that the manufacturer and batch number can be determined if they are used illegally.  The taggant must survive the detonation of the product and not be contaminated by the environment afterwards.  Several different technologies have been considered, but the most common are microscopic polymer/metallic particles.  Taggant evidence was crucial in the 1980 conviction of James L. McFillin in [[Maryland]] for the 1979 truck bombing murder of Nathan A. Allen, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/713/f2d/57/united-states-v-l-mcfillin|title=UNITED STATES of America, Appellee, v. James L. McFILLIN, Appellant.|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contention claimed for opposing mandated taggants is that most terrorist attacks use homemade explosives (HME) which would allegedly not be tagged.  Examples given included, for instance, the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]], the [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City]] and the [[Omagh bombing]]s. Contamination of the site is also cited as a problem, since different taggants might be present at a crime scene from, for example, explosives used to obtain the building materials.

[[Switzerland]] passed a law in 1980 requiring taggants in explosives manufactured there, and that the code must be changed every six months.  So far it is the only country which requires identification taggants. Imported explosives must be tagged only if competing products are also manufactured in Switzerland.

In the United States, The [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] opposed the mandated use of taggants in firearm propellants after tests reveled a dangerous increase in burn rates.  A chemical incompatibility with the propellent powders caused such an increase in pressures it was determined many firearms would burst using a taggent-laced powder that had been stored for as little as several months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/1999/08/06/42124.htm Tagging Explosives], ''[[ABC Science]]'', Karl S. Kruszelnicki, August 6, 1999. Retrieved 31 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taggants for brand protection==
When used as a chemical marker, taggants can be used for authentication of products and documents.
Taggants are sometimes used by brand owners and governments to authenticate commonly counterfeited items. Taggants are integrated into the material of the item itself or into the packaging. Once integrated, the taggants can only be verified with specially engineered readers.

===Common taggant anticounterfeiting features===
* Taggants are uniquely encoded materials or chemistries that act as virtual "fingerprints"
* Taggants can be invisible to the naked eye or visible (covert or overt)
* Taggants can be detectable with specially-engineered equipment or detected with low cost detectors for field testing
* Taggant technology should be extremely difficult to reverse engineer 
* Once integrated into an item, taggants should mark the item permanently and should not be removable

===Common taggant anticounterfeiting applications===
* Tax Stamp authentication
* Banknote authentication
* Cigarette anticounterfeiting
* Alcohol anticounterfeiting
* Pharmaceutical anticounterfeiting
* [[Fast-moving consumer goods]] anticounterfeiting
* Building materials
* Consumer products

'''TekBots''' are programmable [[robot]]s used by several universities to help students learn some of the fundamental concepts that are found in the fields of computer and electrical engineering.

TekBots are centered on the [[Atmel]] [[microcontroller]] platform. This is the "brain" of the robot as it controls the robot's two motorized wheels allowing it to move. The robot's controller boards, wheels and all other peripherals are housed in an aluminum base.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}
The original TekBots program was developed by the [[Oregon State University College of Engineering]]. Professors there wanted to provide a fun and interesting way for students to get excited about engineering. In 2000, the TekBots program was able to get off the ground with a $500,000 grant from the Oregon-based company, [[Tektronix]] inc.

Freshman students entering Oregon State University's engineering program start out with $80 worth of electronics to build their initial TekBot. As the students take more and more classes while in the electrical and computer engineering program, more and more functionality is added to the robots; such as [[bump sensor]]s to sense when the robot has struck a wall or [[LCD screen]]s to display a message or even [[infrared]] (IR) transmitters and receivers to communicate with the robot.

Students program the robot using such software as [[AVR Studio]] 4 in order to write and [[compiler|compile]] a [[C (programming language)|C]] program. The program is then transferred to the robot via a [[USB]] or [[parallel port]] [[dongle]].

The TekBots program at Oregon State University is still seed-funded by Tektronix today.

TekBots is currently offered by 5 universities worldwide:

*[[Oregon State University]]
*[[Iowa State University]]
*[[Rochester Institute of Technology]]
*[[University of Nebraska]]
*[[Fukuoka Institute of Technology]]

Several community colleges and other universities have also purchased TekBots over the years.

==Current classes==
At most of the colleges the TekBot is used in an introduction to the [[electrical engineering]] course. At Oregon State they are used as a platform for learning in 10 classes. At Nebraska they are used in three classes in combination with the Mega 128 microcontroller. Also at Rochester they are used in [[digital logic]] courses as well as the microprocessor and introduction classes.

Both Nebraska and Oregon State combine the TekBot in integrating a freshman mentoring program.

Many senior design projects at Oregon State are completed with the TekBot. An example was the Tekway, a [[Segway PT|Segway]] built using TekBots brains.

Miniaturizing components has always been a primary goal in the [[semiconductor]] industry because it cuts production cost and lets companies build smaller computers and other devices. Miniaturization, however, has increased dissipated power per unit area and made it a key limiting factor in [[integrated circuits|integrated circuit]] performance. Temperature increase becomes relevant for relatively small-cross-sections wires, where it may affect normal semiconductor behavior. Besides, since the generation of heat is proportional to the frequency of operation for switching circuits, fast computers have larger heat generation than slow ones, an undesired effect for chips manufacturers. This article summaries physical concepts that describe the generation and conduction of heat in an integrated circuit, and presents numerical methods that model heat transfer from a macroscopic point of view.

==Generation and transfer of heat==

===Fourier's law===
At macroscopic level, [[Fourier's law]] states a relation between the transmitted heat per unit time per unit area and the gradient of temperature:

: &lt;math&gt;q= - \kappa \nabla T &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal conductivity, &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;W·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

===Joule heating===
Electronic systems work based on current and voltage signals. Current is the a flow of charged particles through the material and these particles (electrons or holes), interact with the lattice of the crystal losing its energy which is released in form of heat. [[Joule Heating]] is a predominant mechanism for heat generation in integrated circuits&lt;ref name="test"&gt;T. Bechtold, E. V. Rudnyi and J. G Korvink, "Dynamic electro-thermal simulation of microsystems—a review," Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering. vol. 15, pp. R17–R31, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and is an undesired effect in most of the cases. For an ohmic material, it has the form:

: &lt;math&gt; Q = j^{2} \rho &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; is the current density in &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;A·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the specific electric resistivity in &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;·m&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; is the generated heat per unit volume in &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;W·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

===Heat-transfer equation===

The governing equation of the physics of the [[heat transfer]] problem relates the flux of heat in space, its variation in time and the generation of power by the following expression:

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla\left(\kappa\left( T\right) \nabla T\right)+g=\rho C\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal conductivity, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the medium, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat, &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\kappa}{\rho C}&lt;/math&gt;, the thermal diffusivity and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of heat generation per unit volume. Heat diffuses from the source following the above equation and solution in an homogeneous medium follows a Gaussian distribution.

==Techniques to solve heat equation ==

===Kirchhoff transformation===
To get rid of the temperature dependence of &lt;math&gt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt;, Kirchhoff transformation can be performed &lt;ref name="baty"&gt;W. Batty, C. E. Christoffersen, A. J. Panks, S. David, C. M. Snowden, M. B. Steer, “Electrothermal CAD of Power Devices and Circuits With Fully Physical Time- Dependent Compact Thermal Modeling of Complex Nonlinear 3-d Systems,” IEEE Trans. Comp. and Pack. Technologies, vol. 24, no. 4, pp. 566–590, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \theta=T_{s}+\frac{1}{\kappa_{s}}\int_{T_{s}}^{T}\kappa(T)dT &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{s} = \kappa\left( T_{s}\right) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the heat sink temperature. When applying this transformation, the heat equation becomes:

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha\nabla^{2}\theta+\frac{\alpha}{\kappa_{s}}g=\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \alpha=\frac{\kappa}{\rho C} &lt;/math&gt; is called the diffusivity,&lt;ref name="baty"/&gt; which also depends on the temperature. To completely linearize the equation, a second transformation is employed:

&lt;math&gt; \alpha_{s}\tau=\int_{0}^{t}\alpha(\theta)dt &lt;/math&gt;

yielding the expression:

&lt;math&gt; \nabla^{2}\theta-\frac{1}{\alpha_{s}}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \tau}=-\frac{g}{\kappa_{s}} &lt;/math&gt;

Simple, direct application of this equation requires approximation.  Additional terms arising in the transformed Laplacian are dropped, leaving the Laplacian in its conventional form.&lt;ref name="baty"/&gt;

===Analytical solutions===
Although analytical solutions can only be found for specific and simple cases, they give a good insight to deal with more complex situations.  Analytical solutions for regular subsystems can also be combined to provide detailed descriptions of complex structures. In Prof. Batty's work,&lt;ref name="baty"/&gt; a Fourier series expansion to the temperature in the Laplace domain is introduced to find the solution to the linearized heat equation.

====Example====
This procedure can be applied to a simple but nontrivial case: an homogeneous cube die made out of GaAs, L=300&amp;nbsp;um. The goal is to find the temperature distribution on the top surface. The top surface is discretized into smaller squares with index i=1...N. One of them is considered to be the source.

Taking the Laplace transform to the heat equation:
: &lt;math&gt; \nabla^{2}\bar{\Theta}-\frac{s}{k_{s}}\bar{\Theta}=0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Theta}=s\theta-\theta\left(\tau=0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Function &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Theta}&lt;/math&gt; is expanded in terms of cosine functions for the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; variables and in terms of hyperbolic cosines and sines for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; variable. Next, by applying adiabatic boundary conditions at the lateral walls and fix temperature at the bottom (heat sink temperature), thermal impedance matrix equation is derived:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta\theta_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}R_{TH_{ij}}(t)P_{j}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where the index &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; accounts for the power sources, while the index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; refers to each small area.

For more details about the derivation, please see Prof. Batty's paper,.&lt;ref name="baty"/&gt;
The below figure shows the steady state temperature distribution of this analytical method for a cubic die, with dimensions 300&amp;nbsp;um. A constant power source of 0.3W is applied over a central surface of dimension 0.1L x 0.1L. As expected, the distribution decays as it approaches to the boundaries, its maximum is located at the center and almost reaches 400K

&lt;center&gt;
[[File:battysup.png]]
&lt;/center&gt;

===Numerical solutions===
Numerical solutions use a mesh of the structure to perform the simulation. The most popular methods are: Finite difference time-domain (FDTD) method, Finite element method (FEM) and method of moments (MoM).

The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a robust and popular technique that consists in solving differential equations numerically as well as certain boundary conditions defined by the problem. This is done by discretizing the space and time, and using finite differencing formulas, thus the partial differential equations that describe the physics of the problem can be solved numerically by computer programs.
 
The FEM is also a numerical scheme employed to solve engineering and mathematical problems described by differential equations as well as boundary conditions. It discretizes the space into smaller elements for which basis functions are assigned to their nodes or edges. Basis functions are linear or higher order polynomials. Applying the differential equation and the boundary conditions of the problem to the basis functions, a system of equations is formulated using either the [[Ritz method|Ritz]] or [[Galerkin method]]. Finally, a direct or iterative method is employed to solve the system of linear equations.&lt;ref name="jin"&gt;J.-M. Jin, The Finite Element Method in Electromagnetics. New York: Wiley, 2nd ed., 2002&lt;/ref&gt; For the thermal case, FEM method is more suitable due to the nonlinearity nature of the thermal properties.

====Example====
The previous example can be solved with a numerical method. For this case, the cube can by discretized into rectangular elements. Its basis functions can be chosen to be a first order approximation (linear):

&lt;math&gt; N_{i}^{e}=\frac{1}{2}\xi\left(1\mp\zeta\right),\qquad i=1,4 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; N_{i}^{e}=\frac{1}{2}\eta\left(1\mp\zeta\right),\qquad i=2,5 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; N_{i}^{e}=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\xi-\eta\right)\left(1\mp\zeta\right),\qquad i=3,6 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\zeta=2(z-z_{c})/h_{z} &lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;z_{c}=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\zeta=2z/h_{z}&lt;/math&gt;.

Using this basis functions and after applying Galerkin's method to the heat transfer equation, a matrix equation is obtained:

&lt;math&gt; \left[S\right]\left\{ \theta\right\} +\left[R\right]\frac{d}{dt}\left\{ \theta\right\} =\left\{ B\right\} &lt;/math&gt;

where,

: &lt;math&gt; R_{ij}=\int_{v}N_{j} N_{i}dV &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; S_{ij}=k\int_{v}\nabla N_{j}.\nabla N_{i}dV &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; B_{i}=\frac{k}{\kappa_{s}}\int_{\Omega_{1}}N_{i}p(x,y)d\Omega+\frac{k}{\kappa_{s}}\int_{v}N_{i}gdV-kT_{o}\sum_{j=0}^{N_{D}}\int_{v}\nabla N_{j}^{D}.\nabla N_{i}dV&lt;/math&gt;.

This expressions can be evaluated by using a simple FEM code. For more details, please see.&lt;ref name="jin"/&gt; The figure below shows the temperature distribution for the numerical solution case. This solution shows very good agreement with the analytical case, its peak also reaches 390 K at the center. The apparent lack of smoothness of the distribution comes from the first order approximation of the basis functions and this can be solved by using higher order basis functions. Also, better results might be obtained by employing a denser mesh of the structure; however, for very dense meshes the computation time increases a lot, making the simulation non-practical.

The next figure shows a comparison of the peak temperature as a function of time for both methods. The system reaches steady state in approximately &lt;math&gt;1 ms&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;
[[File:Analithic&amp;FEM1.PNG|400px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

===Model order reduction===
The numerical methods such as FEM or FDM derive a matrix equation as shown in the previous section. To solve this equation faster, a method called [[Model order reduction]] can be employed to find an approximation of lower order. This method is based on the fact that a high-dimensional state vector belongs to a low-dimensional subspace [http://modelreduction.com/ModelReduction/].

Figure below shows the concept of the MOR approximation: finding matrix V, the dimension of the system can be reduced to solve a simplified system. 
&lt;center&gt;
[[File:DiagramMOR2.png|400px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore, the original system of equation:

: &lt;math&gt;C\left\{ x\right\} '+K\left\{ x\right\} =F\left\{ u\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;V^{T}CV\left\{ z\right\} '+V^{T}KV\left\{ z\right\} =V^{T}F\left\{ u\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

Whose order is much lower than the original making the computation much less expensive. Once the solution is obtained, the original vector is found by taking the product with V.

==Conclusion==
The generation of heat is mainly produced by joule heating, this undesired effect has limited the performance of integrated circuits. In the preset article heat conduction was described and analytical and numerical methods to solve a heat transfer problem were presented. Using these methods, steady state temperature distribution was computed as well as the peak temperature as a function of time for a cubic die. For an input power of &lt;math&gt;0.3 W &lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt; 3.333e8 W/m_{2} &lt;/math&gt;) applied over a single surface source on the top of a cubic die a peak increment of temperature in the order of 100 K was computed. Such increase in temperature can affect the behavior of surrounding semiconductor devices. Important parameters like mobility change drastically. That is why the heat dissipation is a relevant issue and must be considered for circuit designing.

A '''Tubing spider''' is a [[tool]] used primarily in the [[oil industry]] for gripping the [[drill string]] while assembling or reassembling parts of the string.

The spider is normally operated [[hydraulic]]ally from a remote location. The spider consists of multiple gripper tools, sometimes constructed as wedge-shaped arms ([[Slips (oil drilling)]]) that holds the string by the downward force of the pipe. Teeth on the inside of the slips grip the pipe, and the resulting [[Compressive forces|compressive force]] inward on the drill pipe holds the pipe securely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4533">'''Wafer bonding''' is a packaging technology on [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-level for the fabrication of [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS), [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (NEMS), [[microelectronics]] and [[optoelectronics]], ensuring a mechanically stable and hermetically sealed encapsulation. The wafers' diameter range from 100&amp;nbsp;mm to 200&amp;nbsp;mm (4 inch to 8 inch) for MEMS/NEMS and up to 300&amp;nbsp;mm (12 inch) for the production of microelectronic devices. Smaller wafers were used in the early days of the microelectronics industry, with wafers being just 1 inch in diameter in the 1950s.

== Overview ==
In microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (NEMS), the package protects the sensitive internal structures from environmental influences such as temperature, moisture, high pressure and oxidizing species. The long-term stability and reliability of the functional elements depend on the encapsulation process, as does the overall device cost.&lt;ref name="Cho2005" /&gt; The package has to fulfill the following requirements:&lt;ref name="GOWF2005" /&gt;
* protection against environmental influences
* heat dissipation
* integration of elements with different technologies
* compatibility with the surrounding periphery
* maintenance of energy and information flow

== Techniques ==
The commonly used and developed bonding methods are as follows:
* [[Direct bonding]]
* [[Surface activated bonding]]
* [[Plasma activated bonding]]
* [[Anodic bonding]]
* [[Eutectic bonding]]
* [[Glass frit bonding]]
* [[Adhesive bonding]]
* [[Thermocompression bonding]]
* [[Reactive bonding]]
* [[Transient liquid phase diffusion bonding]]

== Requirements ==
The bonding of wafers requires specific environmental conditions which can generally be defined as follows:&lt;ref name="PK1999" /&gt;

# substrate surface
#* flatness
#* smoothness
#* cleanliness
# bonding environment
#* bond temperature
#* ambient pressure
#* applied force
# materials
#* substrate materials
#* intermediate layer materials

The actual bond is an interaction of all those conditions and requirements. Hence, the applied technology needs to be chosen in respect to the present substrate and defined specification like max. bearable temperature, mechanical pressure or desired gaseous atmosphere.

== Evaluation ==
The bonded wafers are characterized in order to evaluate a technology's yield, bonding strength and level of hermeticity either for fabricated devices or for the purpose of process development. Therefore, several different approaches for the [[bond characterization]] have emerged. On the one hand non-destructive optical methods to find cracks or interfacial voids are used beside destructive techniques for the bond strength evaluation, like tensile or shear testing. On the other hand, the unique properties of carefully chosen gases or the pressure depending vibration behavior of micro resonators are exploited for hermeticity testing.

{{Way of the Roses Map}}
The '''Way of the Roses''' is the newest of [[Great Britain]]'s coast-to-coast, long-distance [[Bicycle|cycle]] routes and is based on minor roads, disused railway lines and specially constructed [[cycle path]]s.  It lies entirely within the counties of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], crossing the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and the [[Yorkshire Wolds]] in the north of England, passing through the historic cities of [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and [[York]] and scenic towns and villages including [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]], [[Pateley Bridge]] and [[Ripon]].

At {{convert|170|mi}} long,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Way of the Roses|url=http://www.gps-routes.co.uk/routes/home.nsf/RoutesLinksCycle/way-of-the-roses-walking-and-cycle-route|website=GPS Cycle and Walking Routes|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the route is designed for the whole range of cyclists, from families to [[cycling club]] riders.  Although a challenge with some hard climbs—the highest point being over {{convert|1312|ft}} the route is steadily increasing in popularity. The route is fully open and signed.

The route is named after the [[Wars of the Roses]], a fifteenth-century war between the English dynastic families [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[House of York|York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McFarland|first1=Rob|title=Coast to coast England cycling trip: The Way of the Roses|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/3476732/coast-to-coast-england-cycling-trip-the-way-of-the-roses/?cs=34|accessdate=1 September 2017|work=Newcastle Herald|date=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The route was developed by [[Sustrans]] and part of the [[National Cycle Network]] (NCN Route 69) in partnership with various [[Local Authorities]], [[Lancaster City Council]], [[Cyclists Touring Club]], [[Bridlington Renaissance Partnership]] and [[Welcome to Yorkshire]] amongst others.  The route was opened in 2010 running from [[Morecambe]] on the west coast of [[Lancashire]] to the east coast at [[Bridlington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC – 'Way of the Roses' coast-to-coast cycle route launched|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/york/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_8976000/8976459.stm|accessdate=1 September 2017|work=BBC News|date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second diversion between Pateley Bridge and York that goes via Harrogate and Knaresborough was opened in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On your bike coast to coast|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/analysis/on-your-bike-coast-to-coast-1-2583714|accessdate=1 September 2017|work=The Yorkshire Post|date=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is  a section that links [[Kingston upon Hull]] to the cycle route that joins/leaves near [[Pocklington]] rather than going to/from Bridlington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Way of the Roses|url=https://www.bridlingtonrenaissance.com/app/download/5788715214/Way+of+the+Roses+flyer.pdf|website=bridlingtonrenaissance.com|accessdate=1 September 2017|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art ==
A number of public artworks have been commissioned for the route.  [[Matt Baker (British artist)|Matt Baker]] is currently developing a series of linked artworks at various points along the route.  This work has not yet been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Way of the Roses — Public Art|url=http://wayoftheroses.info/news/story/public_art|website=wayoftheroses.info|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Route ==
The route is well signposted with signs carrying the name of the route or marked with the [[Red Rose of Lancaster|red]] and [[White Rose of York|white]] [[heraldry|heraldic]] [[rose]]s from which the name of the route is derived.

The route starts in the resort town of Morecambe, Lancashire loosely following the [[River Lune]] and the [[River Wenning]] into the Pennines at Settle and entering into the stunning scenery of the [[Yorkshire Dales National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Way of the Roses coast to coast ride|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/05/long-distance-rides-way-of-roses|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 June 2012|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   From there it makes its steepest climb (eastwards) across the edge of [[List of peaks in the Yorkshire Dales|Rye Loaf Hill]] before descending to [[Airton]].  Thence it heads northeast to [[Grassington]] before following the [[River Wharfe]] for several miles and then turning towards the high point of the route at [[Greenhow]] and descending to [[Pateley Bridge]] on the [[River Nidd]].  Beyond Pateley Bridge the hills are significantly lower and after Ripon (with a short exception of the Yorkshire Wolds) the route is more or less flat, passing through York before finally reaching Bridlington and the [[North Sea]]. The route is made up primarily of:

*'''Minor Roads''' – quiet, country roads – 90%
*'''Main Roads''' – mainly short sections through urban areas – 5%
*'''Cyclepaths/Off Road''' – disused railway lines etc.- 5%

The Way Of The Roses is best ridden from West to East to take advantage of the [[prevailing winds]] from the West&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Way of the Roses, cycle from Lancashire to East Yorkshire|url=http://www.countryfile.com/days-out/way-roses-lancashire-east-yorkshire|website=Countryfile.com|accessdate=1 September 2017|date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the more favourable gradients.  Tradition dictates that you start the ride by dipping your back wheel in the [[Irish Sea]] and only ends when your front wheel gets a dip in the [[North Sea]] at the finish. It is typically completed in 3–5 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roller coaster: a cycle trip across northern England|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/jul/24/new-coast-to-coast-cycle|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 June 2012|author=Dixe Wills|date=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NCN-route-688-western-start-sign.jpg|thumb|Way of the Roses signs at Winterburn, the junction between routes 68 and 688.]]
The Way of the Roses makes use of 8 National Cycle Network routes. Starting in Morecambe on [[National Cycle Route 69|Route 69]]. It transfers to [[National Cycle Route 68|Route 68]] at Clapham {{nowrap|({{coord|54.1173|-2.3918|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}),}} on to [[National Cycle Route 688|Route 688]] at Winterburn {{nowrap|({{coord|54.0226|-2.1025|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}),}} and [[National Cycle Route 65|Route 65]] at Linton-on-Ouse {{nowrap|({{coord|54.0387|-1.2351|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}).}} Through central York {{nowrap|({{coord|53.9614|-1.0924|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}})}} it follows the short [[National Cycle Route 658|Route 658]] before joining [[National Cycle Route 66|Route 66]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.9597|-1.0511|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}).}} At Pockington {{nowrap|({{coord|53.9309|-0.7758|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}})}} it takes [[National Cycle Route 164|Route 164]] over the Yorkshire Wolds before picking up [[National Cycle Route 1|Route 1]] near Hutton Cranswick {{nowrap|({{coord|53.954|-0.498|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}),}} which it then uses to the finish in Bridlington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Way of the Roses Sustrans' Cycle Route Map.|date=2010|publisher=Sustrans|isbn=1901389839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The route links to other parts of the NCN so can be used as part of a longer [[Bicycle touring|cycle tour]]. In addition to the above listed routes the way of the Roses has junctions with [[National Cycle Route 700|Route 700]] at Morecambe {{nowrap|({{coord|54.0710|-2.8760|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}),}} [[National Cycle Route 6|Route 6]] at Lancaster {{nowrap|({{coord|54.0522|-2.8025|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}),}} [[National Cycle Route 67|Route 67]] near Fountains Abbey {{nowrap|({{coord|54.0914|-1.5771|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}).}} and [[National Cycle Route 167|Route 167]] at Huggate in the Yorkshire Wolds{{nowrap|({{coord|53.984|-0.6638|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}).}}

Route maps for The Way Of The Roses and detailed route guides from other publishers are available from [[Sustrans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Way of the Roses – Map|url=https://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/way-of-the-roses|website=Sustrans|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
