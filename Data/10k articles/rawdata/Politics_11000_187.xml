'''Adrian Michael Berry, 4th Viscount Camrose''' (15 June 1937 – 18 April 2016)&lt;ref name="Telegraphobit"&gt;
{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/04/19/viscount-camrose--obituary/
|title= Viscount Camrose |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[hereditary peer]], journalist, and writer.

==Biography==
Berry was born in 1937, the elder son of [[Michael Berry, Baron Hartwell|Michael Berry]], who was later created Lord Hartwell, and disclaimed the family title of [[Viscount Camrose]], by his marriage to Lady [[Pamela Smith]], the daughter of [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|F.E. Smith]].&lt;ref name="Telegraphobit"/&gt; Adrian Berry was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. 

From 1977 until 1996, he was the science correspondent of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. On stepping down from that position he became the paper's Consulting Editor (Science).&lt;ref name="Telegraphobit"/&gt; He was a [[FRGS#Fellowship|Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society]], a [[Royal Astronomical Society#Fellowship|Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society]], and a [[British Interplanetary Society|Fellow of the British Interplanetary Society]].

==Marriage and family==
In 1967, Berry married Marina Beatrice Sulzberger, daughter of [[Cyrus Leo Sulzberger II|Cyrus Sulzberger]] (a member of the family which owns ''[[The New York Times]]'') and Marina Tatiana Ladas. The couple had two children:&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p4517.htm#i45168  The Peerage, entry for 4th Viscount Camrose]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change==
In his article published in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' in 2015, Berry argued that [[climate change]] "has more to do with the violent outbursts of energy that our solar system meets on its eternal passage through the Milky Way" than on the "fashionable theory of climate change caused by carbon dioxide" which "is contradicted by all the geological evidence."&lt;ref name="climate_change_2015"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/nightsky/11356838/The-Night-Sky-February-2015-is-climate-change-caused-by-astronomical-events-beyond-our-control.html |work=The Sunday Telegraph |title=The Night Sky February 2015: Is climate change caused by astronomical events beyond our control? |date=1 February 2015 |accessdate=1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry served on the advisory committee of the [[Global Warming Policy Foundation]] (GWPF)&lt;ref name="CWPF_2015"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.thegwpf.org/new-chairman-of-gwpf-academic-advisory-council-2/ |title=New chairman of GWPF academic advisory council|date=4 January 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016 |work=GWPF }}&lt;/ref&gt;—a [[think tank]] that promotes [[Climate change denial|climate-change denial]]&lt;ref name="IJ denial"&gt;{{citation|first=Ian |last=Johnston |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/nigel-lawsons-climatechange-denial-charity-intimidated-environmental-expert-9350069.html |title=Nigel Lawson's climate-change denial charity 'intimidated' environmental expert |work=The Independent |date=11 May 2014 |accessdate=1 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140511082724/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/nigel-lawsons-climatechange-denial-charity-intimidated-environmental-expert-9350069.html |archivedate=11 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and warns against the "extremely damaging and harmful policies" proposed by governments to [[Climate change mitigation|mitigate]] [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8398103.stm | title=Ed Miliband clashes with Lord Lawson on global warming | date=6 December 2009 | work=[[BBC News]] | publisher=[[news.bbc.co.uk]] | accessdate=22 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{Cite press release | title=Launched today! | publisher=The Global Warming Policy Foundation | date=23 November 2009 | url=http://www.thegwpf.org/launched-today/ | accessdate=25 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1737">The '''Adulteration of Coffee Act 1718''' (5 Geo. 1 c. 11) was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] concerning the [[adulterant|adulteration]] of [[coffee]], which made it illegal to debase coffee.

==History==
It was passed in 1718. When coffee later fell out of fashion to be replaced by [[tea]], a similar law was then introduced, the [[Adulteration of Tea Act of 1776]].

The Act provided a penalty of 20 pounds "against divers evil-disposed persons who at the time or soon after roasting of coffee, make use of water, grease, butter, or such like material whereby the same is made unwholesome and greatly increased in weight, to the prejudice of His Majesty's Revenue, the health of his subjects, and to the loss of all fair and honest dealers."

The Act was repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1958]].

{{Gene Sharp}}
The '''Albert Einstein Institution''' is a non-profit organization that specializes in the study of the methods of [[nonviolent resistance]] in conflicts and to explore its policy potential and communicate these findings through print and other media, translations, [[Academic conference|conferences]], consultations, and workshops. The institution's founder and senior scholar, [[Gene Sharp]], is known for his writings on strategic nonviolent struggle.

==History==
The institute is named after the [[physicist]] [[Albert Einstein]], who was, at least at some points in his life, a pacifist. The institution "is committed to the defense of freedom, democracy, and the reduction of political violence through the use of nonviolent action".

To further this mission, the Institution has supported research projects; actively consulted with resistance and pro-democracy groups from [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Egypt]], [[Tibet]], [[Serbia]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], the [[Occupied Palestinian Territories]], and elsewhere; and worked to publicize the power and potential of nonviolent struggle around the world through educational materials, scholarly writings, workshops, and the media.

The Albert Einstein Institution was founded in 1983 and operates out of a small office in [[East Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].

A feature documentary by Scottish director, [[Ruaridh Arrow]], ''[[How to Start a Revolution]]'', about the global influence of the Albert Einstein Institution and Gene Sharp's work was released in September 2011. The film won "Best Documentary" and "The Mass Impact Award" at the Boston Film Festival in September 2011.[10] The European premiere was held at London's Raindance Film Festival on October 2, 2011 where it also won Best Documentary.[11] The film has been described as the unofficial film of the Occupy Wall St movement being shown in Occupy camps in cities all over the world. The film screened to MPs and Lords in the British Houses of Parliament on February 1, 2012.

==Criticism==
Former Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]] accused the Albert Einstein Institution of being behind a "soft coup" attempt in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="ElUniversal20070604"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2007/06/04/pol_ava_chavez-propone-que-p_04A879211.shtml|title=Chávez propone que países del ALBA conformen una "federación de repúblicas"|accessdate=June 11, 2007|publisher=[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]|date=June 4, 2007|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Sharp&lt;ref name="GeneSharp_responds"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharp |first=Gene |authorlink=Gene Sharp |coauthors= |title=Corrections – an open letter from Gene Sharp |work= |publisher=[[Voltaire Network]] |date=June 12, 2007 |url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article30032.html |doi= |accessdate=October 12, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tQiUZymd?url=http://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/CORRECTIONS-2.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Albert Einstein Institution have dismissed such accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thephoenix.com/article_ektid52417.aspx The Phoenix &gt; News Features &gt; The dictator slayer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the accusations against the institution, professor [[Stephen Zunes]] initiated a petition titled "Open Letter in Support of Gene Sharp and Strategic Nonviolent Action"&lt;ref name="OpenLetter"&gt;{{cite web| title=Open Letter in Support of Gene Sharp and Strategic Nonviolent Action|url=http://stephenzunes.org/petition/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which expresses support for Dr Sharp and the Albert Einstein Institution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12949">'''Barisan Nasional Parliamentary Council''' ({{lang-ms|Majlis Ahli Parlimen Barisan Nasional}}; [[abbreviation|abbrev]]: '''BNPC''') is composed of only [[Barisan Nasional]] MPs responsible for holding the [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Government]] to account and for developing and disseminating the party's policy positions.

The council is chaired by [[Ismail Sabri Yaakob]], who was selected in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/berita/politik/ismail-sabri-dipilih-pengerusi-bnpc-1.716760|title=Ismail Sabri dipilih Pengerusi BNPC|author=Borhan Abu Samah|newspaper=Utusan Online|date=26 July 2018|accessdate=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backbenchers Club==
The '''Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club''' (commonly referred to as the '''Backbenchers Club''', '''BNBBC''' or '''BBC'''; {{lang-ms|'''Kelab Ahli Penyokong Barisan Nasional'''}}) was a loose [[caucus]] of 108 members of the lower house of the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]] of [[Malaysia]], the ''[[Dewan Rakyat]]'', belonging to the governing [[Barisan Nasional]] [[coalition]]. The term "[[backbencher]]" originates from the [[British Parliament]], denoting a Member of Parliament (MP) who is not a member of the [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Cabinet]] or is otherwise part of the government through the holding of a post such as [[Parliamentary Secretary]]. 

Originally the BNBBC was not prominent in Parliamentary affairs. However, in 2005, it drew attention when its then Chairman, [[Shahrir Abdul Samad]], publicly called for the restoration of the [[Parliamentary Services Act]] (PSA) so Parliament could be self-sufficient in conducting its own affairs. The backbenchers supported Shahrir, but little was heard further on after the matter blew over. Then in 2006, Shahrir quit as the BNBBC Chair after not receiving support from the backbenchers in voting for a motion brought by Opposition Leader [[Lim Kit Siang]] ([[Democratic Action Party|DAP]]-[[Ipoh Timur]]). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=14062 "Shahrir wants BN to shine"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311033908/http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=14062 |date=March 11, 2007 }}. (May 9, 2006). ''The Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Chairman [[Raja Ahmad Zainuddin Raja Omar]] was appointed the Acting Chair.

After 2008 Elections, [[Bintulu]] MP [[Tiong King Sing]] of the [[Sarawak Progressive Democratic Party]] was appointed chairman of the BNBBC. [[Bung Moktar Radin]], MP of [[Kinabatangan]] was appointed deputy chairman.

The BN Backbenchers Club was replaced by the BN Parliamentary Council following the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|2018 general election]], held on 9 May 2018.

 [http://www.sinoptic.ch/textes/articles/2006/20061102_zhang.weiwei_chinese.model-en.pdf "The allure of the Chinese model"], ''International Herald Tribune'', 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; instituted after [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976 by [[Deng Xiaoping]]. The policies are thought to have contributed to China's eightfold growth in gross national product over two decades.&lt;ref name=monitoring&gt;"Commentator doubts efficacy of "Chinese model" for Iran"| BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political [London] 4 May 2002: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramo/&gt; The phrase "Beijing Consensus" was coined by [[Joshua Cooper Ramo]] to frame China's economic development model as an alternative—especially for developing countries—to the [[Washington Consensus]] of market-friendly policies promoted by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[World Bank]], and [[U.S. Treasury]].&lt;ref name="IPEZ"&gt;[http://ipezone.blogspot.com/2007/02/is-there-beijing-consensus.html "International Political Economy Zone: Is There a Beijing Consensus?"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Turin, Dustin R. | title=China and the Beijing Consensus: An Alternative Model for Development | journal=Student Pulse Academic Journal | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=13 |year=2010 |url= http://studentpulse.com/articles/134/china-and-the-beijing-consensus-an-alternative-model-for-development}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Ramo explained that the Beijing Consensus shows not that "every nation will follow China’s development model, but that it legitimizes the notion of particularity as opposed to the universality of a Washington model".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Maurits Elen | title=Interview: Joshua Cooper Ramo | journal=The Diplomat | year= August 2016 |url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/08/interview-joshua-cooper-ramo/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramo has detailed it as a pragmatic policy that uses innovation and experimentation to achieve "equitable, peaceful high-quality growth", and "defense of national borders and interests",&lt;ref name=Ramo/&gt; whereas other scholars have used it to refer to "stable, if repressive, politics and high-speed economic growth".&lt;ref name="Kurlantzick"&gt;{{cite news |last= Kurlantzick|first=Joshua|date= 23 January 2014|title=The Rise of Elected Autocrats Threatens Democracy| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-23/the-rise-of-elected-autocrats-threatens-democracy|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|volume=|pages=|quote=China’s stable, if repressive, politics and high-speed economic growth—the “Beijing Consensus”—have impressed elites in places such as Thailand, where democracy seems to have produced only graft, muddled economic planning, and political strife|via=|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others criticize its vagueness, claiming that there is "no consensus as to what it stands for" other than being an alternative to the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] Washington Consensus,&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; and that the term "is applied to anything that happens in Beijing, regardless of whether or not it has to do with a 'Chinese Model of Development,' or even with the People's Republic of China (PRC) per se".&lt;ref name=Dirlik/&gt;  This fluidity has been described as an "ultra-pragmatic" approach to policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasmath|first=Reza|date= 2014|title=White Cat, Black Cat or Good Cat: The Beijing Consensus as an Alternative Philosophy for Policy Deliberation? The Case of China|ssrn=2496090|journal=Barnett Papers in Social Research |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=1-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joshua Cooper Ramo==
The term's birth into the mainstream political lexicon was in 2004 when the [[United Kingdom]]'s Foreign Policy Centre published a paper by [[Joshua Cooper Ramo]] titled ''The Beijing Consensus.''&lt;ref name=Ramo&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramo|first=Joshua Cooper|title=The Beijing Consensus|url=http://fpc.org.uk/fsblob/244.pdf|work=May 2004|publisher=The Foreign Policy Centre|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this paper, he laid out three broad guidelines for economic development under what he called the "China model". Ramo was a former senior editor and foreign editor of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine and later a partner at [[Kissinger Associates]], the consulting firm of former [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]].&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2006/09/15/beijing_consensus/ No consensus on the Beijing Consensus - How the World Works - Salon.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first guideline involves a "commitment to innovation and constant experimentation." One of the major criticisms of the Washington Consensus is its complacency. Ramo argues that there is no perfect solution, and that the only true path to success is one that is dynamic, as no one plan works for every situation.{{r|salon}}

The second guideline states that [[Per Capita Income]] (GDP/capita) should not be the lone measure of progress. Rather, Ramo feels that the sustainability of the economic system and an even distribution of wealth, along with [[GDP]], are important indicators of progress.{{r|salon}}

The third guideline urges a policy of self-determination, where the less-developed nations use [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] to keep the [[superpower]]s in check and assure their own financial sovereignty. This includes not only financial self-determination, but also a shift to the most effective military strategy, which Ramo suggests is more likely to be an [[asymmetric warfare|asymmetric strategy]] rather than one that seeks direct confrontation. Unlike the Washington Consensus, which largely ignored questions of [[geo-politics]], Ramo argues—particularly in the Chinese context—that geo-politics and [[geo-economics]] are fundamentally linked.

==Arif Dirlik==
One critic of Ramo's plan is [[University of Oregon]] professor [[Arif Dirlik]], a "notable specialist in Chinese and in intellectual history," who wrote the paper ''Beijing Consensus: Beijing "Gongshi." Who Recognizes Whom and to What End.'' Although Dirlik is intrigued by the concepts and philosophy of Ramo's Beijing Consensus, he says that Ramo's plan is a "Silicon Valley model of development" that ignores the fact that the exploitation of China's labor force by foreign countries was a major part of the Chinese development.{{r|salon}} Ultimately though, and despite other criticism, Dirlik concludes that the Beijing Consensus does serve an important goal: "The most important aspect of the Beijing Consensus may be an approach to global relationships that seeks, in multinational relationships, a new global order founded on economic relationships, but which also recognizes political and cultural difference as well as differences in regional and national practices within a common global framework."&lt;ref name=Dirlik&gt;Dirlik, Arif. University of Oregon. "[http://www.ids-uva.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/9_Dirlik1.pdf Beijing Consensus: Beijing 'Gongshi.']"&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Williamson==
In his January 2012 article in ''Asia Policy'' Williamson describes the Beijing Consensus as consisting of five points:
# Incremental Reform (as opposed to a [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] approach),
# Innovation and Experimentation,
# [[Export-oriented industrialization|Export Led Growth]],
# [[State Capitalism]] (as opposed to Socialist Planning or Free Market Capitalism).
# [[Authoritarianism]] (as opposed to Democracy or Autocracy).

==Stefan Halper==
[[Stefan Halper]], Director of American Studies at the Department of Politics, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and former [[foreign policy]] official in the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford|Ford]], and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administrations, offered his own interpretation of the term in his 2012 book, ''The Beijing Consensus: How China's Authoritarian Model Will Dominate the Twenty-First Century''. Halper argues that China's model of economic development without corresponding democratic reforms is serving as a template throughout the [[Developing country|developing world]]. It is one that Beijing eagerly exports (as demonstrated by its support of other illiberal regimes, such as those in [[Sudan]], [[Angola]], or [[Zimbabwe]]) by offering developing countries "no-strings-attached gifts and loans", rather than "promoting democracy through economic aid", as does the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halper|first1=Stefan|title=The Beijing consensus : how China's authoritarian model will dominate the twenty-first century|date=2010|publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0465013616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Halper argues China's dependence on natural resources will lock Beijing into relationships with rogue states and that Beijing will not feel increasing pressure democratize as it grows richer, because it is wealth that gives the regime its legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Nathan&gt;{{cite web|last=Nathan|first=Andrew J.|title=The Beijing Consensus: How China's Authoritarian Model Will Dominate the Twenty-first Century|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66379/stefan-halper/the-beijing-consensus-how-chinas-authoritarian-model-will-domina|date=28 January 2014|work=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=May–June 2010|format=book review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He sees this as establishing a trend "Away from the [[Market economy|market]]-[[Liberal democracy|democratic]] model—and toward a new type of [[capitalism]], which can flourish without the values and norms of [[Liberalism|Western liberalism]]"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.theglobalist.com/stefan-halper-on-the-beijing-consensus/ Stefan Halper on the Beijing Consensus"]. ''[[The Globalist]]''. 2 October 2010. '''Note''': Not an actual interview, quotations are drawn from book with questions added to provide context.&lt;/ref&gt; which could ultimately supplant the [[Washington consensus]].

==Spread==
According to Indonesian scholar Ignatius Wibowo, “the Beijing Consensus clearly has gained ground in Southeast Asia” as countries there  “have shifted their development strategy from one based on free markets and democracy to one based on semi-free markets and an illiberal political system.” China provides training in economic management and various civil-service skills for more than 10,000 bureaucrats from other developing countries. The training includes sessions where China’s successes in improving living standards are promoted.&lt;ref name=Kurlantzick/&gt;

=="China Model"==
The China Model is sometimes used interchangeably with the Beijing Consensus,&lt;ref name=Zhang/&gt; and sometimes by those who insist "it is inaccurate to describe the Chinese model as the 'Beijing consensus' versus the 'Washington consensus'."&lt;ref name=ZHANG&gt;{{cite news|last=ZHANG|first=Weiwei|title=The allure of the Chinese model|url=http://www.sinoptic.ch/textes/articles/2006/20061102_zhang.weiwei_chinese.model-en.pdf|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|date=2 November 2006|quote=It is inaccurate to describe the Chinese model as the "Beijing consensus" versus the "Washington consensus." What makes the Chinese experience unique is that Beijing has safeguarded its own policy space as to when, where and how to adopt foreign ideas.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Among the characteristics attributed to the "China Model" by Western commentators include:
*replacing trust in the free market for economic growth with "a more muscular state hand on the levers of capitalism";&lt;ref name=beware/&gt;
*an absence of political liberalization;&lt;ref name=monitoring /&gt;
*strong leading role of ruling political party;&lt;ref name=monitoring/&gt;
*population control;&lt;ref&gt;'India should adopt Chinese model' ''The Statesman'' [New Delhi] 14 Nov 1999: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prc1952-2005gdp.gif|thumb|right|300px|China's nominal [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] trend from 1952 to 2005. Note the rapid increase since reform in the late 1970s.]]

According to academic and former Chinese official Zhang Weiwei, the "key features" of the model are:

*down-to-earth pragmatic concern with serving the people;&lt;ref name=ZHANG/&gt;
*constant trial and error experimentation;&lt;ref name=ZHANG/&gt;
*gradual reform rather than neo-liberal economic [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]];&lt;ref name=ZHANG/&gt;
*a strong and pro-development state;&lt;ref name=ZHANG/&gt;
*"selective cultural borrowing" of foreign ideas;&lt;ref name=ZHANG/&gt;
*a pattern of implementing easy reforms first, difficult ones later.&lt;ref name=ZHANG/&gt;

The model received considerable attention following the [[Late-2000s recession|2008-9 severe economic downturn]] in the Western world as an alternative to the "Washington Consensus"  liberal-market approach.&lt;ref name=beware&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Beware the Beijing model |url= http://www.economist.com/node/13721724|newspaper= [[The Economist]] |location= |date=May 26, 2009|accessdate= October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics at the free-market oriented magazine ''[[The Economist]]'' have called the model "unclear" and an invention of "American think-tank eggheads" and "plumage-puffed Chinese academics".&lt;ref name=beware/&gt; Instead of strong government, the critics have stated that China's success results from its "vast, cheap labor supply", its "attractive internal market for foreign investment", and its access to the American market, which provides a perfect spendthrift counterpart for China's exports and a high savings rate.&lt;ref name=beware/&gt;

In May 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that China had released data that "showed its economy was continuing to weaken", and quoted a political scientist at [[Renmin University of China]] in Beijing (Zhang Ming) as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many economic problems that we face are actually political problems in disguise, such as the nature of the economy, the nature of the ownership system in the country and groups of vested interests. ... The problems are so serious that they have to be solved now and can no longer be put off.&lt;ref name=doubts&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Doubts-cast-over-China-model-as-growth-falters/948252/ "Doubts cast over China model as growth falters"], ''The New York Times'', 12 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2018, [[Zhang Weiying]], professor at [[Peking University]]'s National School of Development, argued that China's economic development since 1978 was not due to a distinctive "China model". He added that, "From the western perspective, the 'China model' theory makes China into an alarming outlier, and must lead to conflict between China and the western world", adding that [[Trump tariffs|the tariffs]] and [[2018 China–United States trade war|the trade war]] persued by U.S. president [[Donald Trump]] ere an understandable response to perceived antagonism from China: "In the eyes of westerners, the so-called 'China model' is '[[state capitalism]]', which is incompatible with fair trade and world peace and must not be allowed to advance triumphantly without impediment".&lt;ref name="Wildau"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wildau |first1=Gabriel |title=Chinese economists blame 'China model' for US trade war |url=https://www.ft.com/content/6a5c9258-db3d-11e8-9f04-38d397e6661c |accessdate=31 October 2018 |work=Financial Times |subscription=y |date=30 October 2018 |location=Shangai}}&lt;/ref&gt; This speech was removed from the university website after it was widely circulated online. Shen Hong of the [[Unirule Institute of Economics]] warned against abandoning [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s [[Chinese economic reform|post-1978 neoliberal reforms in China]], telling the ''[[Financial Times]]'': "Without a doubt, reform and opening up eliminated the ideological conflict between China and the US, as well as the whole western world, and gradually brought convergence in terms of values".&lt;ref name="Wildau" /&gt;

The '''Beira Patrol''' was a [[blockade]] of [[Petroleum|oil]] shipments to [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) through [[Beira, Mozambique]], resulting from United Nations trade sanctions on Rhodesia.

==Background==
Rhodesia's government [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared the former colony's independence]] on 11 November 1965, after rejecting British preconditions for independence that involved racial equality and rule by the black majority. [[Ian Smith]], the country's elected [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|prime minister]], continued in that role. The [[United Nations Security Council]] reacted by passing [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 217|Resolution 217]], calling for sanctions on Rhodesia. The resolution was later used by the British as legal justification for the blockade.

Britain imposed its own national sanctions, including an [[oil embargo]], but ruled out invading Rhodesia. The British were initially opposed to military action, instead relying on UN sanctions to pressure the Rhodesians. A majority of UN member states wanted expanded sanctions and military measures. The British initially attempted to block such initiatives.

In October 1965, the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] estimated that even a full trade embargo would fail to cripple Rhodesia's economy, but suggested that prolonged and severe economic pressure could induce the white electorate to overthrow the government. In early 1966, Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] made statements that sanctions were working, predicting that the Rhodesian government would soon fall. At the same time, the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] was looking into the possibility of a maritime blockade.

During the first week of February 1966, it became clear that Rhodesia continued to import oil by land from South Africa, and Prime Minister Wilson was warned that black African states could push for more urgent sanctions and raise the matter at the UN. On 24 February, the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] warned that tankers with oil for Rhodesia could arrive in the port of Beira, the terminus of a pipeline going to Rhodesia, unnoticed, and began preparing a maritime surveillance plan for submission to the Prime Minister. Later in February, the British government and world press began focusing on tankers carrying oil for Rhodesia when on 25 February, the Rhodesian Commerce and Industry Minister announced that a tanker with oil for Rhodesia would soon arrive.

==Blockade==
Following the reports of Rhodesia defying the oil embargo by sea, the British felt pressure to take action and thus prove their commitment to sanctions. On 1 March, the [[Royal Navy]] established the Beira Patrol and stationed the frigate {{HMS|Lowestoft|F103|6}} off Beira, directing it to prepare for intercept operations starting on 4 March.&lt;ref name="DOS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Daniel Owen|title=A History of the Royal Navy: Empire and Imperialism|year=2015|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London|isbn=978-1-78076-543-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March, early warning aircraft from the carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} began search operations in the [[Mozambique Channel]].&lt;ref name="DOS"/&gt; The frigate [[HMS Rhyl (F129)|HMS ''Rhyl'']] and a logistical support ship were soon added. On 28 Feb 1966 {{HMS|Eagle|R05|6}} sailed from Singapore on passage to Beira and remained on station until 31 April 1966 relieved by {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09}} returning to Singapore on 10 May 1966.&lt;ref name="DOS"/&gt; In 71 days ''Eagle'' flew 1,070 sorties, flying 600,000 miles, surveying 200,000 square miles daily, steaming a total of 30,000 miles (details as per HMS ''Eagle'' Beira Patrol diary from the Line Book 1964-66).

The patrol lasted until 1975. At any time, two British frigates or destroyers, with the support of land and carrier-based surveillance aircraft and auxiliary vessels, were committed to the patrol. Various British warships cruised the [[Mozambique Channel]] {{convert|20|–|45|mi|km}} from Beira and checking on oil tankers heading for the port. 

Initially, Royal Navy ships were to shadow and question Beira-bound tankers, and were only allowed to forcibly divert a tanker away after Britain obtained permission from its flag state. However, in the event that permission was granted, British warships were only allowed to demand it change course in the name of its flag state, and fire a shot across the bow if it did not work. The use of force was not authorised, and if the tanker absolutely refused to comply, the shadowing warship could take no more action and only follow it to within Mozambique's six-mile territorial limit. This meant that the tanker would be allowed to proceed unhindered to port.

After an incident where the [[Greece|Greek]] tanker ''[[Joanna V]]'' freely sailed into Beira after Greece refused to grant permission, the British lobbied for UN authority to use force. The UN Security Council subsequently passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 221|Resolution 221]]. However, resolution confined the blockade to Beira and authorised only the Royal Navy to use force. As a result, the Royal Navy alone had to enforce the blockade without assistance, and tankers with oil for Rhodesia could freely dock at other Mozambican ports. The resolution also empowered the British to seize the ''Joanna V'' upon its departure from Beira if it had discharged its oil cargo there.

The rules of engagement were subsequently liberalised, but use of force was limited "to the very minimum", and Defence Ministry approval was required for the diversion of vessels. British warships also had to remain outside of Mozambique's territorial waters. After an embarrassing incident involving the French tanker ''Artois'', the rules of engagement were further modified, allowing the use of disabling fire. 

Britain never managed to obtain UN authority allowing other navies to participate. As well as lacking UN permission, the British judged it outside their capabilities to blockade other Mozambican ports. South Africa was also capable of transporting oil to Beira by having tankers cruise through South African and then Mozambican territorial waters, providing legal immunity from interception. As a result, Rhodesia continued to receive oil shipments. Rhodesia was also able to withstand the blockade by strictly rationing oil. In September 1966, it was estimated that Rhodesia received 220,000 gallons of oil daily, when it needed only 200,000 a day under its rationing policy. 

The patrol was gradually reduced in several stages. In March 1971, new Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] allowed the Royal Navy to commit one warship at a time, rather than two. Three months later, the patrol lost its air component when the [[Malagasy Republic]] asked the [[Royal Air Force]] to eliminate its detachment at [[Majunga]]. After an overall drop in the number of frigates in the fleet, the Royal Navy was allowed to make the patrol intermittent. The patrol was finally eliminated on 25 June 1975, when Mozambique gained independence from [[Portugal]] and assured Britain that it would not allow transship oil to Rhodesia. 

The operation had cost an estimated 100 million [[Pound sterling|pounds]], and 76 Royal Navy ships took part in the operation. A total of 47 oil tankers were intercepted, of which 42 were allowed to proceed.

{{Donald Trump series}}
[[Marijuana]] ([[cannabis]]) and the rights of individual states to legalize recreational and medical marijuana was an issue of President [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]], and he formally stated during his campaign that he believed states should have the right to manage their own policies with regard to medical and recreational marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hightimes.com/news/politics/pot-matters-trump-on-marijuana/|title=Pot Matters: Trump on Marijuana – High Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4594445/legal-marijuana-trump-sessions-policy/|title=7 Reasons Trump Is Unlikely to Fight Legal Marijuana|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his election, he reversed his position on recreational marijuana and stated he believed medical marijuana should be allowed but stated the federal government may seek legal resolutions for those states which regulate the growth and sale of recreational marijuana.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/320902-white-house-hints-at-crackdown-on-recreational-marijuana|title=White House hints at crackdown on recreational marijuana|first=Meghashyam|last=Mali|date=February 23, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/expect-greater-enforcement-of-marijuana-laws-under-trump-spicer-says-2017-02-23|title=Expect ‘greater enforcement’ of marijuana laws under Trump, Spicer says|first=Trey|last=Williams|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sean Spicer]], the White House press secretary at the time, stated at a news conference in February 2017 that the United States Department of Justice might seek greater enforcement of marijuana legislation at the federal level.

In October 2018, The Trump administration seeks public comments On Marijuana Reclassification, according to Forbes. Trump is looking to make it a strong campaign topic to help his re-election and the funding for the Mexico border wall.

{{further|History of medical cannabis|Medical cannabis in the United States}}

On February 23, 2017, [[Sean Spicer]] during a White House press conference stated: that the United States Department of Justice may seek greater enforcement of marijuana legislation at the federal level against states who sponsor and distribute recreational marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/23/spicer-feds-could-step-up-anti-pot-enforcement-in-states-where-recreational-marijuana-is-legal/|title=Spicer: Feds could step up enforcement against marijuana use in states|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to state that President Trump supports the legalization of medical marijuana for those who are suffering with a medical condition.  Sean Spicer stated that the administration believed there was a link between recreational marijuana use and opiate abuse, despite the fact that current studies show the reverse and that marijuana use actually results in a lower incidence of opiate abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-legal-marijuana-legislation-2017-story.html|title=Here's what's driving lawmakers working to legalize recreational pot in 17 more states|first=Kurtis|last=Lee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/marijuana/trump-spokesman-predicts-greater-enforcement-of-federal-marijuana-laws-8823783|title=Trump Spokesman Predicts Greater Enforcement of Federal Marijuana Laws|first=Kate McKee|last=Simmons|date=February 23, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Spicer said: "There is a big difference between the medical use […] that is very different from the recreational use, which is something the Department of Justice will be further looking into."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/24/marijuana-entrepreneurs-try-to-stay-calm-after-spicer-comments-on-weed.html|title=Marijuana entrepreneurs try to stay calm after Spicer comments on weed|first=Kate|last=Rogers|date=February 24, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "There’s two distinct issues here: medical marijuana and recreational marijuana. I think medical marijuana, I’ve said before, that the president understands the pain and suffering that many people go through, who are facing especially terminal diseases, and the comfort that some of these drugs, including medical marijuana, can bring to them. And that’s one that Congress, through a rider in 2014, put an appropriations bill saying that the Department of Justice wouldn’t be funded to go after those folks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/23/14717638/sean-spicer-trump-marijuana-legalization|title=Sean Spicer just said we should expect an anti-marijuana crackdown under Trump|first=German|last=Lopez|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[signing statement]] on the 2017 federal budget was one of the first official statements on the administration's policies.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump and Sessions at odds over prosecuting legal marijuana states|url=http://www.newsweek.com/trump-and-sessions-are-odds-over-prosecuting-legal-marijuana-states-661925|website=www.newsweek.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, according to [[Bloomberg News]], the President "signaled he may ignore a congressional ban on interfering with state medical marijuana laws".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Trump Questions Legal Binds on His Spending in Signing Statement|author=Toluse Olorunnipa|date=May 6, 2017|publisher =Bloomberg News|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-06/trump-questions-legal-binds-on-his-spending-in-signing-statement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2018, Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] rescinded three Obama-era memos that had adopted a policy of non-interference with states that have legalized recreational marijuana, including the 2013 [[Cole Memorandum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/19f6bfec15a74733b40eaf0ff9162bfa|title=Sessions terminates US policy that let legal pot flourish|website=apnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 13, US Senator [[Cory Gardner]] (R - Colorado) stated that Trump reaffirmed his commitment to upholding the rights of states to regulate cannabis within their associated jurisdictions and assured states with legalized cannabis that the rescission of the Cole Memo would not subject them to federal prosecutors, after Gardner threatened to block the appointment of 20 DOJ nominees in response to the memo's rescission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herrington|first1=A.J.|title=Trump Makes Deal to Protect States with Legal Cannabis|url=https://hightimes.com/news/trump-makes-deal-protect-states-legal-cannabis/|website=High Times|publisher=High Times|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response of the states ==
{{Legality of cannabis by US state}}
{{As of|2018}}, twenty-eight states have legalized marijuana for medical use. Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Michigan, and Washington and the District of Columbia have legalized it for recreational use as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theolympian.com/news/nation-world/national/article134608869.html|title=Donald Trump plans to go after recreational marijuana use|last1=Kumar|first1=Anita|last2= Hotakainen|first2=Rob|work=The Olympian|date=February 23, 2017|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 2017, the governors of Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington sent a letter to the U.S. administration urging continuation of Federal policy under the [[Cole Memorandum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Governors of marijuana states urge Trump administration to maintain "hands off" marijuana policies|author=Brian Heuberger|newspaper=The Colorado Statesman|date=April 19, 2017|url=https://www.coloradostatesman.com/governors-marijuana-states-urge-trump-administration-maintain-hands-off-marijuana-policies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington state===
Washington State Attorney General [[Bob Ferguson (politician)|Bob Ferguson]] stated Washington will defend its marijuana laws: “I will resist any efforts by the Trump administration to undermine the will of the voters in Washington state,” Ferguson said in an interview.  On February 15, Ferguson and Governor Jay Inslee sent a letter to U.S. attorney general [[Jeff Sessions]] stating that illegal dealing in the State of Washington has been replaced with a tax-paying regulated industry, and the move has freed up law enforcement officers for other duties. “Given the limited resources available for marijuana law enforcement, a return to ‘full’ prohibition’ is highly unlikely to end the illicit production, trafficking and consumption of marijuana,” said Ferguson and Inslee in the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/marijuana/washington-state-will-resist-federal-crackdown-on-legal-weed-ag-ferguson-says/|title=Washington state will resist federal crackdown on legal weed, AG Ferguson says|date=February 23, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/latest-news/article134608869.html|title=Trump administration plans crackdown on recreational marijuana|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nevada===
Nevada Senate Majority Leader [[Aaron D. Ford]] called on the state’s attorney general to “vigorously defend” the state's laws.  “Not only did voters overwhelmingly vote to approve the legalization of recreational marijuana, the governor’s proposed education budget depends on tax revenue from recreational marijuana sales,” Ford said. “Any action by the Trump administration would be an insult to Nevada voters and would pick the pockets of Nevada’s students.”&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/23/cannabis-industry-roiled-white-house-comments-enforcement/98323774/|title=Cannabis industry roiled by White House comments on enforcement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oregon===
On February 24, 2017 Senator [[Ron Wyden]] of [[Oregon]] stated, “The federal government needs to respect the decisions of Oregon voters. Instead the Trump administration is threatening states' rights, including the rights of one in five Americans who live in a state where marijuana is legal.” He stated he would ask the state to oppose federal government intrusion into the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/2017/02/24/the-cannabis-industry-is-on-high-alert-after-sean-spicers-comments/#5108667a5235|title=The Cannabis Industry Is On High Alert After Sean Spicer Suggests Feds Will Crack Down On Marijuana|first=Debra|last=Borchardt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13033">'''Christofascism''' is a combination of ''[[Christian]]'' and ''[[fascism]]'' coined by [[Dorothee Sölle]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Dorothee Sölle]] |year=1970|title= Beyond Mere Obedience: Reflections on a Christian Ethic for the Future. |publisher=Augsburg Publishing House|location= Minneapolis | url=https://books.google.com/?id=zbeCGwAACAAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= | coauthors = |title=Confessing Christ in a Post-Christendom Context. |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66279081.html | quote = ...shall we say this, represent this, live this, without seeming to endorse the kind of christomonism (Dorothee Sölle called it ‘Christofascism’!... | publisher= The Ecumenical Review | date= July 1, 2000 | accessdate = 2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sarah K. |last=Pinnock |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Theology of Dorothee Soelle |url= https://books.google.com/?id=56_VviorwEsC&amp;dq |quote= ...of establishing a dubious moral superiority to justify organized violence on a massive scale, a perversion of Christianity she called Christofascism.... | isbn=1-56338-404-3 |publisher= Trinity Press International |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sölle, a [[liberation theology]] proponent, used the term to describe the Christian church which she characterized as totalitarian and imperialistic.

==Interpretation of Sölle==
Tom Faw Driver, the [[Paul Tillich]] Professor Emeritus at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]], expressed concern "that the worship of God in Christ not divide Christian from Jew, man from woman, clergy from laity, white from black, or rich from poor".  To him, Christianity is in constant danger of Christofascism, stating that "[w]e fear christofascism, which we see as the political direction of all attempts to place Christ at the center of social life and history" and that "[m]uch of the churches' teaching about Christ has turned into something that is dictatorial in its heart and is preparing society for an American fascism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Christ in a Changing World: Toward an Ethical Christology|author=Tom Faw Driver|pages=19|year=1981|publisher= Crossroad | url=https://books.google.com/?id=K8oWAAAAIAAJ&amp;q |quote=We fear Christofascism ... | isbn=0-8245-0105-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Theocentric Christology|author=Paul F.

Christofascism "disposed or allowed Christians, to impose themselves not only upon other religions but other cultures, and political parties which do not march under the banner of the final, normative, victorious Christ" – as Knitter describes Sölle's view.&lt;ref name= Hoffman&gt;{{cite book| title= Law, Freedom, and Story: The Role of Narrative in Therapy, Society, and Faith| author= John Charles Hoffman| pages= 127–28| year= 1986| publisher= Wilfrid Laurier University Press | isbn=0-88920-185-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wildman  |first=Wesley J | authorlink = |coauthors= |title=Fidelity With Plausibility: Modest Christologies in the Twentieth Century |year= 1998| publisher = State University of New York Press|quote=Driver argues that traditional Christology fosters what he calls ‘Christofascism.’  He means by this, first, the absolutizing of the past in order to... | url=https://books.google.com/?id=kZrqBkS-m_QC&amp;pg |isbn=0-7914-3595-4 |location=Albany, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Hunsinger, director of the Centre for Barth Studies at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], regards the conception of Christofascism as being an attack, at a very sophisticated level of theological discourse, on the biblical depiction of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]. He equates what is viewed as Christofascism with "Jesus Christ as depicted in Scripture" and contrasts it with the "nonnormative [[Christology]]" that is offered as an alternative by some theologians, which he characterizes as extreme relativism that reduces Jesus Christ to "an object of mere personal preference and cultural location" and that he finds difficult to see as not contributing to the same problems encountered by the Christian church in Germany that were noted by theologian [[Karl Barth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Hunsinger|year=2001|title= Disruptive Grace: Studies in the Theology of Karl Barth |publisher=Wm B Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0-8028-4940-7|page =99|chapter=Where the Battle Rages: Confessing Christ in America Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christomonism==
Douglas John Hall, Professor of Christian Theology at [[McGill University]], relates Sölle's concept of Christofascism to Christomonism, that inevitably ends in religious triumphalism and exclusivity, noting Sölle's observation of American [[fundamentalist Christianity]] that Christomonism easily leads to Christofascism, and that violence is never far away from militant Christomonism. (Christomonism accepts only one divine person, Jesus Christ, rather than the Trinity.) He states that the over-divinized ("high") Christology of [[Christendom]] is demonstrated to be wrong by its "almost unrelieved [[anti-Judaism]]".  He suggests that the best way to guard against this is for Christians not to neglect the humanity of Jesus Christ in favour of his divinity, and to remind themselves that Jesus was also a Jewish human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title =Confessing Christ in a Post-Christendom Context |author= Douglas John Hall |url= http://religion-online.org./showarticle.asp?title=528| booktitle= 1999 Covenant Conference, Network of Presbyterians | date = November 6, 1999 | place = Atlanta, GA|publisher= Religion Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Early Christian Literature: Christ and Culture in the Second and Third Centuries |author=Helen Rhee|chapter=Superiority of Christian Monotheism | pages= 80| year=2005| publisher= Routledge| isbn= 0-415-35487-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= The Identity of Jesus in a Pluralistic World| author=Douglas John Hall| url= http://www.genevalutheran.ch/spaghetti/articles/THE%20IDENTITY%20OF%20JESUS%20IN%20A%20PLURALISTIC%20WORLD.doc | format=Microsoft Word}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American history and politics==
American historians and political commentators have also used the term to refer to politico-religious tendencies in American society.

[[Chris Hedges]] and [[David Neiwert]] contend that the beginning of American Christofascism was during the [[Great Depression]], when Americans espoused forms of fascism that were "explicitly 'Christian' in nature".&lt;ref name="Neiwert"&gt;{{Cite book | pages =88–90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4KO44oqqH2kC |title=The eliminationists: how hate talk radicalized the American right |first= David A |last= Neiwert | isbn =978-0-9815769-8-5 | date =2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |88}} Hedges writes that "fundamentalist preachers such as [[Gerald B. Winrod]] and [[Gerald L. K.

By the late 1950s, followers of these philosophies became the [[John Birch Society]], whose policy positions and rhetoric have greatly impacted modern [[dominionism|dominionists]].&lt;ref name="Hedges"/&gt;  Likewise, the [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus movement]] began with former associates of Pelley and Smith.&lt;ref name= "Neiwert" /&gt;{{rp |90}} The 1980s saw the [[Council for National Policy]]&lt;ref name= "Hedges"/&gt; and the [[Moral Majority]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=On violence: a reader |page=364 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_EBb9bgut74C&amp;pg=PA364 | publisher = Duke University Press |year= 2007 |first= Sharon |last= Welch |chapter= Dangerous Memory and Alternate Knowledges |editor-first=Bruce B |editor-last= Lawrence |editor2-first= Aisha |editor2-last= Karim | isbn=978-0-8223-3756-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "window"&gt;{{Cite book | title= The window of vulnerability: a political spirituality | publisher= Fortress Press | year = 1990 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=_PCIAAAAMAAJ | first= Dorothee | last= Sölle | isbn= 978-0-8006-2432-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; carry on the tradition, while the [[patriot movement]] and [[militia movement]] represented efforts to mainstream the philosophy in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Neiwert"/&gt;{{rp|90}}

Episcopal priest [[Carter Heyward]], professor of theology at [[Episcopal Divinity School]], uses the term to describe political and social policies that exclude nontraditional families in the name of Christianity, a practice she described as "arrogant and blasphemous".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= A different take on family values — Priest blasts 'Christo-fascism' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2qIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lSwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3960,8092650&amp;dq=christofascism&amp;hl=en | work= Milwaukee Journal | date = October 8, 1992 | first = Laurel | last = Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of [[anti-abortion violence]], including the Atlanta and Birmingham bombings committed by [[Eric Robert Rudolph]] and the [[assassination of George Tiller]] at his Wichita, Kansas church in 2009, have also been called Christofascism.&lt;ref name="Neiwert"/&gt;{{rp|90–91}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 2, 2009 |url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/643783 |work=The Star |title=Doctor's killing is domestic terrorism |first=Antonia |last=Zerbisias |authorlink=Antonia Zerbisias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Church Street bombing''' was a car bomb attack on 20 May 1983 in the [[South Africa]]n capital [[Pretoria]] by [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], the [[paramilitary]] wing of the [[African National Congress]]. The bombing killed 19, including the two perpetrators, and wounded 217.&lt;ref name="BBC1983"&gt;{{cite news|title=1983: Car bomb in South Africa kills 16|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=14 March 2015|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/20/newsid_4326000/4326975.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trc-sapa98&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/media/1998/9805/s980506b.htm|title=ANC Mastermind Campaign Justifies Pretoria Church Street Blast|publisher=SAPA|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church Street Bombing was one of the most deadly attacks by the ANC during its armed struggle against South Africa's ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]].

==Attack==
The attack consisted of a car bomb set off outside the Nedbank Square Building, which was shared between [[Nedbank]] and the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Diplomatic mission|embassy]], on Church Street at 4:30 pm on a Friday. The Belgian number plates were made by Guido Van Hecken, today president of Oxfam Belgium&lt;ref&gt;https://re-act.be/2014/02/24/eng-president-of-oxfam-solidarity-belgium-is-a-former-terrorist/&lt;/ref&gt;, so that the car could enter without problems into the country&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humo.be/humo-archief/265966/helene-passtoors-blikt-terug-op-haar-dagen-als-soldaat-naast-mandela&lt;/ref&gt;. The target was [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF) headquarters, but as the bomb was set to go off at the height of rush hour, those killed and wounded included civilians. The bomb went off ten minutes earlier than planned, killing two of the perpetrators, Freddie Shangwe and Ezekial Maseko. At least 20 ambulances took the dead and wounded to hospitals.&lt;ref name="BBC1983"/&gt;

==Truth Commission hearing==
In submissions to the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) in 1997 and 1998, the ANC revealed that the attack was orchestrated by a special operations unit of the ANC's [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), commanded by Aboobaker Ismail. At the time of the attack, they reported to [[Joe Slovo]] as chief of staff, and the Church Street attack was authorised by [[Oliver Tambo]].&lt;ref name=trc-sapa97/&gt;&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;

The ANC's submission said the bombing was in response to a South African cross-border raid into [[Lesotho]] in December 1982, which killed 42 ANC supporters and civilians, and the assassination of [[Ruth First]], an ANC activist and the wife of Joe Slovo, in [[Maputo]], [[Mozambique]]. It claimed that 11 of the casualties were SAAF personnel and hence a military target. The legal representative of some of the victims argued that as administrative staff including telephonists and typists they could not accept that they were a legitimate military target.&lt;ref name=trc-sapa97&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/media%5C1997%5C9705/s970512a.htm|title=Tambo ordered Church Street blast: ANC|publisher=SAPA|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ten MK operatives, including Aboobaker Ismail, applied for amnesty for this and other bombings. The applications were opposed on various grounds, including that it was a terrorist attack disproportionate to the political motive. The TRC found that the number of civilians versus military personnel killed was unclear. South African Police statistics indicated that 7 members of the SAAF were killed. The commission found that at least 84 of the injured were SAAF members or employees. Amnesty was granted by the TRC in 2000.&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/decisions%5C2001/ac21003.htm|title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission Amnesty Committee AC/2001/003|date=16 January 2000|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clarté''' ([[French language|French]] for "clarity") was a [[socialism|socialist]] and [[pacifist]] organisation in [[Norway]].

It was founded in 1925, and had its roots in a French-based international organization of the same name. The international organization became defunct in 1923, but French and Swedish branches existed, and Danish and Finnish branches came in 1925 and 1926.&lt;ref name=pax&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1976 |title=Clarté |last=Hagtvet |first=Bernt |authorlink=Bernt Hagtvet |encyclopedia=[[Pax Leksikon]] |publisher=Pax |location=Oslo |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/paxlex/alfabetet/c/c04.html#clarte |accessdate=1 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330061459/http://mediabase1.uib.no/paxlex/alfabetet/c/c04.html |archivedate=30 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, Clarté was strongly affiliated with the organization ''[[Mot Dag]]'', and ''Mot Dag''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Arne Ording]] was chairman. Ording also edited the organization's periodical, also named ''Clarté''.&lt;ref name=pax/&gt; This was published between 1929 and 1931.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Clarté – sosialistiske organisasjoner|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Clart%C3%A9/sosialistiske_organisasjoner|language=Norwegian|accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Norwegian, [[Aake Anker Ording]], was secretary-general of ''Nordisk Clartéforbund'' (the Nordic Clarté Association) from 1927.&lt;ref name=pax/&gt; Clarté in Norway existed until 1936, when it was reorganized with the new name Forum.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; ''Mot Dag'' was disestablished in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Mot Dag|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Mot_Dag|language=Norwegian|accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It split in 1940. In light of the [[Winter War]], then-chairman of ''Forum'', [[Gudmund Harlem]], proposed that communists be barred from membership in the organization. 74 voted for, 78 voted against, and the minority left the organization to form ''[[Sosialistisk Studentlag]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pryser|first=Tore|authorlink=Tore Pryser|title=Klassen og nasjonen 1935-1946|year=1988|series=Volume four of ''[[Arbeiderbevegelsens historie i Norge]]''|publisher=Tiden|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=82-10-02754-9|pages=229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data security'''  means protecting [[digital data]], such as those in a [[database]], from destructive forces and from the unwanted actions of [[unauthorized]] users,&lt;ref&gt;Summers, G. (2004). Data and databases.  In: Koehne, H Developing Databases with Access: Nelson Australia Pty Limited. p4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; such as a [[cyberattack]] or a [[data breach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/data-security/knowing-your-data-to-protect-your-data.html Knowing Your Data to Protect Your Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928150717/http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/data-security/knowing-your-data-to-protect-your-data.html |date=2017-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technologies ==

=== Disk encryption ===

[[Disk encryption]] refers to encryption technology that encrypts data on a [[hard disk drive]]. Disk encryption typically takes form in either software (see [[disk encryption software]]) or hardware (see [[disk encryption hardware]]). Disk encryption is often referred to as [[on-the-fly encryption]] (OTFE) or transparent encryption.

=== Software versus hardware-based mechanisms for protecting data ===

Software-based security solutions encrypt the data to protect it from theft. However, a [[malware|malicious program]] or a [[hacker]] could [[data corruption|corrupt the data]] in order to make it unrecoverable, making the system unusable. Hardware-based security solutions can prevent read and write access to data and hence offer very strong protection against tampering and unauthorized access.

Hardware based security or assisted [[computer security]] offers an alternative to software-only computer security. [[Security token]]s such as those using [[PKCS#11]] may be more secure due to the physical access required in order to be compromised. Access is enabled only when the token is connected and correct [[Personal identification number|PIN]] is entered (see [[two-factor authentication]]). However, dongles can be used by anyone who can gain physical access to it. Newer technologies in hardware-based security solves this problem offering full proof security for data.

Working of hardware-based security: A hardware device allows a user to log in, log out and set different privilege levels by doing manual actions. The device uses biometric technology to prevent malicious users from logging in, logging out, and changing privilege levels. The current state of a user of the device is read by controllers in [[peripheral devices]] such as hard disks. Illegal access by a malicious user or a malicious program is interrupted based on the current state of a user by hard disk and DVD controllers making illegal access to data impossible. Hardware-based access control is more secure than protection provided by the operating systems as operating systems are vulnerable to malicious attacks by [[Computer virus|viruses]] and hackers. The data on hard disks can be corrupted after a malicious access is obtained. With hardware-based protection, software cannot manipulate the user privilege levels. It is impossible for a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] or a malicious program to gain access to secure data protected by hardware or perform unauthorized privileged operations. This assumption is broken only if the hardware itself is malicious or contains a backdoor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Waksman | first1 = Adam | last2 = Sethumadhavan | first2 = Simha | title = Silencing Hardware Backdoors | volume =  | pages =  | periodical = Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy | location = Oakland, California | url = http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~simha/preprint_oakland11.pdf | year = 2011 | issn =  | doi =  | isbn =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035803/http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~simha/preprint_oakland11.pdf | archivedate = 2013-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardware protects the operating system image and file system privileges from being tampered. Therefore, a completely secure system can be created using a combination of hardware-based security and secure system administration policies.

=== Backups ===

[[Backup]]s are used to ensure data which is lost can be recovered from another source. It is considered essential to keep a backup of any data in most industries and the process is recommended for any files of importance to a user.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.staysmartonline.gov.au/Protect-yourself/Doing-things-safely/backups&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data masking===
[[Data masking]] of structured data is the process of obscuring (masking) specific data within a database table or cell to ensure that data security is maintained and sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mask-me.net/datamaskingwiki/wiki/26/data-masking-definition|title=Data Masking Definition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227062337/http://mask-me.net/datamaskingwiki/wiki/26/data-masking-definition|archive-date=2017-02-27|dead-url=no|accessdate=1 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may include masking the data from users (for example so banking customer representatives can only see the last 4 digits of a customers national identity number), developers (who need real production data to test new software releases but should not be able to see sensitive financial data), outsourcing vendors, etc.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data erasure===
[[Data erasure]] is a method of software based overwriting that completely destroys all electronic data residing on a hard drive or other digital media to ensure that no sensitive data is lost when an asset is retired or reused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael Wei; Laura M. Grupp; Frederick E.

== International laws and standards ==

=== International laws ===

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] is used to ensure that personal data is accessible to those whom it concerns, and provides redress to individuals if there are inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 |url         = https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/principle-1-fair-and-lawful/

 |archivedate = 13 April 2016
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly important to ensure individuals are treated fairly, for example for credit checking purposes. The Data Protection Act states that only individuals and companies with legitimate and lawful reasons can process personal information and cannot be shared. [[Data Privacy Day]] is an international [[holiday]] started by the [[Council of Europe]] that occurs every January 28. 
&lt;ref name=dataprivacyday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/01/celebrating-data-privacy.html|title=Celebrating data privacy|author=[[Peter Fleischer]], [[Jane Horvath]], [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]]|publisher=[[Google Blog]]|accessdate=12 August 2011|year=2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520195323/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/01/celebrating-data-privacy.html|archivedate=20 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU) became law on May 25th, 2018, organizations may face significant penalties of up to €20million or 4% of their annual revenue if they do not comply with the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-and-gdpr-penalties&lt;/ref&gt;  It is intended that GDPR will force organizations to understand their data privacy risks and take the appropriate measures to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure of consumers’ private information.

=== International standards ===

The international standards ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 27002:2013 covers data security under the topic of [[information security]], and one of its cardinal principles is that all stored information, i.e. data, should be owned so that it is clear whose responsibility it is to protect and control access to that data.

The economics of [[information security]] addresses the economic aspects of [[privacy]] and [[computer security]]. Economics of information security includes models of the strictly rational “[[homo economicus]]” as well as [[behavioral economics]]. '''Economics of security''' addresses individual and organizational decisions and behaviors with respect to security and privacy as market decisions.

Economics of security addresses a core question: why do agents choose technical risks when there exists technical solutions to mitigate security and privacy risks?  Economics addresses not only this question, but also inform design decisions in [[security engineering]].

== Emergence of economics of security ==
[[National security]] is the canonical [[public good]]. The economic status of information security came to the intellectual fore around 2000. As is the case with innovations it arose simultaneously in multiple venues.

In 2000, [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]] wrote, [http://www.acsac.org/2001/papers/110.pdf Why Information Security is Hard].  Anderson explained that a significant difficulty in optimal development of security technology is that incentives must be aligned with the technology to enable rational adoption. Thus, economic insights should be integrated into technical design. A security technology should enable the party at risk to invest to limit that risk. Otherwise, the designers are simply counting on [[altruism]] for adoption and diffusion. Many consider this publication the birth of economics of security.

Also in 2000 at Harvard, Camp at the School of Government and Wolfram in the Department of Economics argued that security is not a [[public good]] but rather each extant vulnerabilities has an associated negative [[externality]] value.  Vulnerabilities were defined in this work as tradable goods.  Six years later, [http://idefense.com/ iDEFENSE], [http://zerodayinitiative.com/  ZDI] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20071125104648/http://www.mozilla.org/security/bug-bounty.html Mozilla] have extant markets for vulnerabilities.

In 2000, the scientists at the Computer Emergency Response Team at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] proposed an early mechanism for risk assessment. The Hierarchical Holographic Model provided the first multi-faceted evaluation tool to guide security investments using the science of risk. Since that time, CERT has developed a suite of systematic mechanism for organizations to use in risk evaluations, depending on the size and expertise of the organization: [http://www.cert.org/octave OCTAVE]. The study of computer security as an investment in risk avoidance has become standard practice.

In 2001, in an unrelated development, [[Lawrence A. Gordon]] and [http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/mloeb/ Martin P. Loeb] published [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=383709 Using information security as a response to competitor analysis systems]. A working paper of the published article was written in 2000. These professors, from Maryland's Smith School of Business, present a game-theoretic framework that demonstrates how information security can prevent rival firms from gaining sensitive information. In this context, the article considers the economic (i.e., cost-benefit) aspects of information security. 

The authors came together to develop and expand a series of flagship events under the name Workshop on the Economics of Information Security.

== Examples of findings in economics of security ==
Proof of work is a security technology designed to stop spam by altering the economics. An early paper in economics of information security argued that [[proof of work]] cannot work. In fact, the finding was that [[proof of work]] cannot work without [[price discrimination]] as illustrated by a later paper, [http://weis2006.econinfosec.org/docs/50.pdf Proof of Work can Work].

Another finding, one that is critical to an understanding of current American data practices, is that the opposite of [[privacy]] is not, in economic terms [[anonymity]], but rather [[price discrimination]]. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.9746&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Privacy and price discrimination] was authored by [[Andrew Odlyzko]] and illustrates that what may appear as information pathology in collection of data is in fact rational organizational behavior.

[[Hal Varian]] presented three models of security using the metaphor of the height of walls around a town to show security as a normal good, public good, or good with externalities. [http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/resources/affiliates/workshops/econsecurity/econws/49.pdf Free riding] is the end result, in any case.

[[Lawrence A. Gordon]] and [http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/mloeb/ Martin P. Loeb] wrote the [http://ns2.virusflags.dc.hu/~mfelegyhazi/courses/EconSec/readings/04_GordonL02economics_security_investment.pdf Economics of Information Security Investment]. The [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] is considered by many as the first economic model that determines the optimal amount to invest to protect a given set of information. The model takes into account the vulnerability of the information to a security breach and the potential loss should such a breach occur.

The '''Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973''' ('''EPAA''') was a U.S. law that required the President to promulgate [[Regulatory economics|regulations]] to allocate and control price of petroleum products in response to the [[1973 oil crisis]].

It was extended by the [[Energy Policy and Conservation Act]] of 1975. The regulations were withdrawn by President [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] in {{Executive Order|12287}} of January 28, 1981.

In 1973 and again in 1979 the US Government took control of private stocks of oil under this law. ([http://www.amymyersjaffe.com/content/pdf/inventoriesaspublicgood.pdf Jaffe &amp; Soligo, "The role of inventories in oil market stability", Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance 42. 2002.] )

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35231">'''Equal pay for equal work'''&lt;ref name="ilolex"/&gt; is the concept of [[labor rights]] that individuals in the same workplace be given equal pay.&lt;ref name="ilolex" /&gt; It is most commonly used in the context of [[sexual discrimination]], in relation to the [[gender pay gap]]. Equal pay relates to the full range of payments and benefits, including basic pay, non-salary payments, bonuses and allowances. Some countries have moved faster than others in addressing the problem. Since President [[John F. Kennedy]] signed the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], it has been illegal in the United States to pay men and women working in the same place different salaries for similar work.

==Early history ==

As wage-labor became increasingly formalized during the [[Industrial Revolution]], women were often paid less than their male counterparts for the same labor, whether for the explicit reason that they were women or under another pretext. The principle of equal pay for equal work arose at the same time, as part of [[first-wave feminism]], with early efforts for equal pay being associated with nineteenth-century [[Trade Union]] activism in industrialised countries: for example, a series of strikes by unionised women in the UK in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Davis, 'An Historical Introduction to the Campaign for Equal Pay', http://www.unionhistory.info/equalpay/roaddisplay.php?irn=820; cf. New JNCHES Equality Working Group, 'The Gender Pay Gap - A Literature Review', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure from Trade Unions has had varied effects, with trade unions sometimes promoting conservatism. However, following the Second World War, trade unions and the legislatures of industrialized countries gradually embraced the principle of equal pay for equal work; one example of this process is the UK's introduction of the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]] in response both to the [[Treaty of Rome]] and the [[Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968]]. In recent years European trade unions have generally exerted pressure on states and employers for progress in this direction.&lt;ref name="eurofound.europa.eu"&gt;Eva Soumeli and Kristine Nergaard, 'Gender pay equity in Europe', ''Eironline: European Industrial Relations Observatory On-line'' (January 2002), http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2002/01/study/tn0201101s.htm, esp. tables 3 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International human rights law==

In [[international human rights law]], the statement on equal pay is the 1951 [[Equal Remuneration Convention]], Convention 100 of the [[International Labour Organization]], a [[United Nations]] body. The Convention states that

:: Each Member shall, by means appropriate to the methods in operation for determining rates of remuneration, promote and, in so far as is consistent with such methods, ensure the application to all workers of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value.&lt;ref name="ilolex"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/equalcompensation.cfm|title=Equal Pay and Compensation Discrimination|author=|date=|website=www.eeoc.gov|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equal pay for equal work is also covered by Article 7 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], article 7''&lt;/ref&gt; Article 4 of the [[European Social Charter]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[European Social Charter]]: Part II, Article 4, section 4''&lt;/ref&gt; and Article 15 of [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], Article 15''&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution of the [[International Labour Organization]] also proclaims "the principles of equal remuneration for equal value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/constq.htm|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091225111436/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/constq.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 December 2009|title=ILOLEX: Constitution|author=|date=|website=arquivo.pt|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EEOC's four affirmative defenses allows unequal pay for equal work when the wages are set "pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) ... any other factor other than sex."&lt;ref name=EEOC/&gt; A pay differential due to one of these factors is not in breach of the Convention.

==Legal situation by jurisdiction==

===European Union/European Economic Area===
Post-war Europe has seen a fairly consistent pattern in women's participation in the labour market and legislation to promote equal pay for equal work across eastern and western countries.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Movileanu, 'Equal Pay', in ''Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World'', ed. by Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, and Jane E. Sloan (SAGE 2011), pp. 491-93, at p. 492. Cf. Kristina Koldinskà, 'Gender Equality: Before and After the Enlargement of EU: The Case of the Czech Republic', ''European Law Journal'', 13 (2007), 238–52, esp. p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries now in the EU, including France, Germany, and Poland, had already enshrined the principle of equal pay for equal work in their constitutions before the foundation of the EU (see table below). When the [[European Economic Community]], later the [[European Union]] (EU), was founded in 1957, the principle of equal pay for equal work was named as a key principle. Article 141 of the Treaty of Rome says 'each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is applied.'&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu.int/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;lg=en&amp;numdoc=c19ons_tre&amp;model=guichett {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608205142/http://europa.eu.int/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;lg=en&amp;numdoc=c19ons_tre&amp;model=guichett |date=2003-06-08 }}. Jill Rubery, 'Equal Pay and Europe', http://www.unionhistory.info/equalpay/roaddisplay.php?irn=785; cf. New JNCHES Equality Working Group, 'The Gender Pay Gap - A Literature Review', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; While socially progressive, this decision does not necessarily indicate widespread progressive attitudes among the signatories to the treaty:

:: While this is often viewed as an example of the progressive nature of the European community, some argue that Article 141 (previously 119) was included largely as a concession to the French who already had equal pay legislation and feared that they would be at a comparative disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;New JNCHES Equality Working Group, 'The Gender Pay Gap - A Literature Review', p. 7 fn. 15, citing Townsend-Smith, ''Sex Discrimination in Employment'' (London: Sweet and Maxwell, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

The EEC's legislation was clarified in 1975 by the binding and directly applicable equal pay directive 75/117/EEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://europa.eu.int/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;lg=en&amp;numdoc=31975L0117&amp;model=guichett |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021219091947/http://europa.eu.int/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;lg=EN&amp;numdoc=31975L0117&amp;model=guichett |archive-date=2002-12-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibited all discrimination on the grounds of sex in relation to pay; this and other directives were integrated into a single Directive in 2006 (2006/54/EC).&lt;ref&gt;New JNCHES Equality Working Group, 'The Gender Pay Gap - A Literature Review', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the national level the principle of equal pay is in general fully reflected in the legislation of the 28 EU member states and the additional countries of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The [[EU candidate countries]] of Macedonia and Turkey also adapted their legislation to EU standards.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt; The main national legislation concerning pay equity between men and women for different European countries is as follows.&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise stated, data is from Eva Soumeli and Kristine Nergaard, 'Gender pay equity in Europe', ''Eironline: European Industrial Relations Observatory On-line'' (January 2002), http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2002/01/study/tn0201101s.htm, table 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2018 Update'''
''Law on Equal Pay Certification based on the Equal Pay Standard in Iceland''

Iceland introduced an Equal Pay Standard in 2012, ÍST 85:2012&lt;ref name="stadlar.is"/&gt; (Equal wage management system - Requirements and guidance).  The standard was developed by the Icelandic trade unions, the employers’ confederation and government officials with the goal in mind that it would help employers prevent salary discrimination and enable them to become certified.

In 2017 the Icelandic government decided to add an amandment to the 2008 laws Act on Equal Status and Equal Rights of Women and Men (#10/2008)&lt;ref name="althingi.is"/&gt;.  The amandment is a law on equal pay certification and was put into effect on January 1 in 2018  &lt;ref name="althingi.is"/&gt;. According to the amandment companies and institutions employing 25 or more workers, on annual basis, will be required to obtain equal pay certification of their equal pay system and the implementation thereof. The purpose of this obligatory certification is to enforce the current legislation prohibiting discriminatory practices based on gender and requiring that women and men working for the same employer shall be paid equal wages and enjoy equal terms of employment for the same jobs or jobs of equal value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.government.is/news/article/2018/01/04/New-Icelandic-law-on-Equal-Pay-Certification-entered-into-force-on-January-1-2018/|title=New Icelandic law on Equal Pay Certification entered into force on January 1, 2018|author=|date=|website=www.government.is|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Federal law: Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964====

{{Main|Equal Pay Act of 1963|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964}}

The first attempt at equal pay legislation in the United States, H.R. 5056, "Prohibiting Discrimination in Pay on Account of Sex," was introduced by Congresswoman [[Winifred C. Stanley]] of Buffalo, N.Y. on June 19, 1944.&lt;ref name="National Archives"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://research.archives.gov/description/4397822 | title=H.R. 5056 Prohibiting Discrimination in Pay on Account of Sex, HR 78A-B1, 06/19/1944, Records of the U.S. House of Representatives (ARC 4397822) | accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty years later, legislation passed by the federal government in 1963 made it illegal to pay men and women different wage rates for equal work on jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and are performed under similar working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finduslaw.com/equal_pay_act_of_1963_epa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8_206_d Equal Pay Act of 1963], finduslaw.com&lt;/ref&gt;  One year after passing the Equal Pay Act, Congress passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  Title VII of this act makes it unlawful to discriminate based on a person's race, religion, color, or sex.&lt;ref&gt;"Civil Rights Act of 1964."  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2000e-17&lt;/ref&gt;  Title VII attacks sex discrimination more broadly than the Equal Pay Act extending not only to wages but to compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment.  Thus with the Equal Pay Act and Title VII, an employer cannot deny women equal pay for equal work; deny women transfers, promotions, or wage increases; manipulate job evaluations to relegate women’s pay; or intentionally segregate men and women into jobs according to their gender.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Robert et al.  Closer Look at Comparable Worth: A Study of the Basic Questions to be Addressed in Approaching Pay Equity.  National Foundation for the Study of Equal Employment Policy: Washington, DC, 1984, pg. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Congress was debating this bill at the same time that the Equal Pay Act was coming into effect, there was concern over how these two laws would interact, which led to the passage of Senator Bennett's Amendment.  This Amendment states: "It Shall not be unlawful employment practice under this subchapter for any employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex ... if such differentiation is authorized by the provisions of the [Equal Pay Act]."   There was confusion on the interpretation of this Amendment, which was left to the courts to resolve.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, Katie.  "Comparable Worth—Its Present Status and the Problem of Measurement."  Hamline Journal of Public Law, Vol. 6, No. 38 (1985), pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus US federal law now states that "employers may not pay unequal wages to men and women who perform jobs that require substantially equal skill, effort and responsibility, and that are performed under similar working conditions within the same establishment."&lt;ref name=EEOC&gt;U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. [http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/fs-epa.cfm ''EEOC Facts About Equal Pay and Compensation Discrimination''], accessed on August 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington state====

In [[Washington (state)|Washington]], Governor Evans implemented a pay equity study in 1973 and another in 1977.&lt;ref name=Remick&gt;Remick, Helen.  "'A Want of Harmony': Perspectives on Wage Discrimination and Comparable Worth."  Ed. Remick, Helen.  Comparable Worth and Wage Discrimination: Technical Possibilities and Political Realities.  Temple University Press: Philadelphia, 1984, pg. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  The results clearly showed that when comparing male and female dominated jobs there was almost no overlap between the averages for similar jobs and in every sector, a twenty percent gap emerged.  For example, a food service worker earned $472 per month, and a Delivery Truck Driver earned $792, though they were both given the same amount of "points" on the scale of comparable worth to the state.&lt;ref name=Remick/&gt; Unfortunately for the state, and for the female state workers, his successor Governor Dixie Lee Ray failed to implement the recommendations of the study (which clearly stated women made 20 percent less than men).&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Debra A.  "State Initiatives in the Federal System: The Politics and Policy of Comparable Worth in 1984."  Publius, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Summer 1985), pg. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;   Thus in 1981, [[AFSCME]] filed a sex discrimination complaint with the [[EEOC]] against the State of Washington.  The District Court ruled that  since the state had done a study of sex discrimination in the state, found that there was severe disparities in wages, and had not done anything to ameliorate these disparities, this constituted discrimination under Title VII that was "pervasive and intentional."&lt;ref&gt;American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (AFSCME), et al. v. State of Washington et al.  No. C 82-465T (District Court for the Western District of Washington), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;   The Court then ordered the State to pay its over 15,500 women back pay from 1979 based on a 1983 study of comparable worth.&lt;ref&gt;Legler, Joel Ivan.  "City, County and State Government Liability for Sex-Based Wage Discrimination After County of Washington v. Gunther and AFSCME v. Washington."  The Urban Lawyer, Vol. 17, No. 2 (Spring 1985), pg. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  This amounted to over $800 million.  However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] overturned this decision, stating that Washington had always required their employees' salaries to reflect the free market, and discrimination was one cause of many for wage disparities.  The court stated, "the State did not create the market disparity ... [and] neither law nor logic deems the free market system a suspect enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (AFSCME), et al. v. State of Washington et al.  770 F.2d 1401 (9th Cir), 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;   While the suit was ultimately unsuccessful, it led to state legislation bolstering state workers’ pay. The costs for implementing this equal pay policy was 2.6% of personnel costs for the state.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.pay-equity.org/info-Q&amp;A.html National Committee on Pay Equity],” pay-equity.org, Accessed Nov. 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minnesota====

In [[Minnesota]], the state began considering a formal comparable worth policy in the late 1970s when the Minnesota Task Force of the Council on the Economic Status of Women commissioned Hay Associates to conduct a study.   The results were staggering and similar to the results in Washington (there was a 20% gap between state male and female workers pay).  Hay Associates proved that in the 19 years since the Equal Pay Act was passed, wage discrimination persisted and had even increased over from 1976 to 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Alice H.  Comparable Worth: A Case book of experiences in states and localities.  Industrial Relations Center: University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1985, pg. 141&lt;/ref&gt;  Using their point system, they noted that while delivery van drivers and clerk typists were both scaled with 117 points each of “worth” to the state, the delivery van driver (a male dominated profession) was paid $1,382 a month while the clerk typist (a female dominated profession) was paid $1,115 a month.&lt;ref&gt;“Pay Equity: The Minnesota Experience: Fifth Edition.”  Legislative Commission on the Economic Status of Women, April 1994, pg. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;   The study also noted that women were severely underrepresented in manager and professional positions; and that state jobs were often segregated by sex.   The study finally recommended that the state take several courses of action: 1) establish comparable worth considerations for female- dominated jobs; 2) set aside money to ameliorate the pay inequity; 3) encourage affirmative action for women and minorities and 4) continue analyzing the situation to improve it.   The Minnesota Legislature moved immediately in response.  In 1983 the state appropriated 21.8 million dollars to begin amending the pay disparities for state employees.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Debra A.  “State Initiatives in the Federal System: The Politics and Policy of Comparable Worth in 1984.”  Publius, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Summer 1985), pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1982 to 1993, women’s wages in the state increased 10%.  According to the Star Tribune, in 2005 women in Minnesota state government made 97 cents to the dollar, ranking Minnesota as one of the most equal for female state workers in the country.

====Federal law: Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act====
In 2009, [[President Obama]] signed the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]], permitting women to sue employers for unfair pay up to 180 days after receiving an unfair paycheck. On 29 January 2016, he signed an [[executive order]] obliging all companies with at least 100 employees to disclose the pay of all workers to the federal government, with breakdowns of pay by race, gender, and ethnicity. The goal is to encourage employers to give equal pay for equal work by increasing transparency.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lam|first1=Bourree|title=Obama's New Equal-Pay Rules|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/01/eeoc-pay-discrimination-obama/433926/|accessdate=1 February 2016|publisher=The Atlantic|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State and local laws, 2010s====

Massachusetts, California, and New York City have adopted laws which prohibit employers from asking about salary history to determine the salary that will be offered for a new job.  This is intended to narrow the gender pay gap by reducing the impact of past discrimination. Many other U.S. states were considering similar laws, as of May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2017/05/30/528794176/proposals-aim-to-combat-discrimination-based-on-salary-history Proposals Aim To Combat Discrimination Based On Salary History]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{main|Gender earnings gap in Australia}}
Under Australia's old centralised wage fixing system, "equal pay for work of equal value" by women was introduced in 1969. Anti-discrimination on the basis of sex was legislated in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, {{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/women.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206144556/http://dfat.gov.au/facts/women.html |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canadian usage, the terms ''pay equity'' and ''pay equality'' are used somewhat differently from in other countries. The two terms refer to distinctly separate legal concepts.

''Pay equality'', or equal pay for equal work, refers to the requirement that men and women be paid the same if performing the same job in the same organization. For example, a female electrician must be paid the same as a male electrician in the same organization. Reasonable differences are permitted if due to seniority or merit.

''Pay equality'' is required by law in each of [[Women's rights in Canada|Canada]]’s 14 legislative jurisdictions (ten provinces, three territories, and the federal government). Note that federal legislation applies only to those employers in certain federally regulated industries such as banks, broadcasters, and airlines, to name a few. For most employers, the relevant legislation is that of the respective province or territory.

For federally regulated employers, pay equality is guaranteed under the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Human Rights Commission, http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca&lt;/ref&gt; In Ontario, pay equality is required under the Ontario Employment Standards Act.&lt;ref name='OESA'&gt;Ontario Ministry of Labour - Employment Standards, http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/es/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2016}} &lt;!-- According to this cite and http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/es/pubs/guide/equalpay.php , OESA guarantees pay equity, not pay equality --&gt; Every Canadian jurisdiction has similar legislation, although the name of the law will vary.

In contrast, ''pay equity'', in the Canadian context, means that male-dominated occupations and female-dominated occupations of comparable value must be paid the same if within the same employer. The Canadian term ''pay equity'' is referred to as “comparable worth” in the US. For example, if an organization’s nurses and electricians are deemed to have jobs of equal importance, they must be paid the same. One way of distinguishing the concepts is to note that ''pay equality'' addresses the rights of women employees as individuals, whereas ''pay equity'' addresses the rights of female-dominated occupations as groups.

Certain Canadian jurisdictions have ''pay equity'' legislation while others do not, hence the necessity of distinguishing between ''pay equity'' and ''pay equality'' in Canadian usage. For example, in Ontario, ''pay equality'' is guaranteed through the Ontario Employment Standards Act&lt;ref name='OESA'/&gt; while ''pay equity'' is guaranteed through the Ontario Pay Equity Act.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Pay Equity Commission, http://www.payequity.gov.on.ca&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the three westernmost provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan) have ''pay equality'' legislation but no ''pay equity'' legislation. Some provinces (for example, Manitoba) have legislation that requires ''pay equity'' for public sector employers but not for private sector employers; meanwhile, ''pay equality'' legislation applies to everyone.

===Taiwan===
{{unsourced section|date=September 2018}}
Taiwan legislated the Act of Gender Equality in Employment in 2002. It regulates that an employer must give the same salary to the workers who do the same work.The law prescribes that employers shall not discriminate against employees because of their gender or sexual orientation in the case of paying wages. Employees shall receive equal pay for equal work or equal value. However, if such differentials are the result of seniority systems, award and discipline systems, merit systems or other justifiable reasons of non-sexual or non-sexual-orientation factors, the above-mentioned restriction shall not apply. Employers may not adopt methods of reducing the wages of other employees in order to evade the stipulation of the preceding paragraph.

==Criticism==
Criticisms of the principle of equal pay for equal work include criticism of the mechanisms used to achieve it and the methodology by which the gap is measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bialik|first=Carl|title=Not All Differences in Earnings are Created Equal|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304198004575172382976442708|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some{{who|date=November 2015}} believe that government actions to correct gender pay disparity serve to interfere with the system of voluntary exchange. They argue the fundamental issue is that the employer is the owner of the job, not the government or the employee. The employer negotiates the job and pays according to performance, not according to job duties. A private business would not want to lose its best performers by compensating them less and can ill afford paying its lower performers higher because the overall productivity will decline.&lt;ref name="Caveat for Employers"&gt;Vedantam, Shankar (2009) "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/31/AR2009053102081.html Caveat for Employers]." Washington Post, June 1, 2009, page A8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Subtle, and stubborn, race bias"&gt;Jackson, Derrick (2009) "[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2009/07/06/subtle_and_stubborn_race_bias/ Subtle, and stubborn, race bias]." Boston Globe, July 6, 2009, page A10&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Independent Women's Forum]] cites another study that prognosticates the wage gap possibly disappearing "when controlled for experience, education, and number of years on the job".&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, June. "The Gender Gap in Wages, circa 2000" American Economic Review, Vol. 93, No. 2 (May 2003), pp. 309-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The difference between equal pay for equal work and equal pay for work of equal value==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Equal pay for equal work !! Equal pay for work of equal value
|-
| Equal pay compares the pay of incumbents in the same or very similar jobs. || Pay equity compares the value and pay of different jobs, such as nurse and electrician.
|-
| Either men or women can complain that their work is undervalued. If a male incumbent is paid less than a female incumbent in the same job, he can file a complaint. As well, a woman or man can complain if she or he is paid less than a man or woman in the same job. || Only people (both men and women) in jobs traditionally reserved for women can complain that their work is undervalued.  If nurses are paid less than electricians by the same employer, then they can file a complaint.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.payequity.gov.on.ca/en/resources/what_diff.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206140256/http://www.payequity.gov.on.ca/en/resources/what_diff.php |archivedate=2014-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem which exists in comparing jobs involving different skills with each other is that there are intangibles besides skills and experience which come into play in determining pay. For example, it may take the same level of skills to be an electrician as it does to be a nurse, but if the electrician is performing their job 200 feet above the base floor of an offshore oil rig, pay will tend to be higher because the attendant risks are likewise higher. Indeed, many argue that the unwillingness of women to work in jobs which are dangerous or otherwise undesirable such as plumbing and coal mining accounts for a significant percentage of the wage gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gender Pay Gap is a Complete Myth |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-gender-pay-gap-is-a-complete-myth/|work=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equality Utah''' is an [[United States|American]] [[non-profit]] [[501(c)(3)]] organization which is [[Utah]]'s largest [[LGBT rights]] group based in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].&lt;ref name="nyt11"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/us/11gay.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22equality%20utah%22&amp;st=cse|title=Gay Leaders in Utah Plan 5-Bill Attack in Legislature |last=Johnson|first=Kirk|date=November 10, 2008 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=December 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is a member of the [[Equality Federation]].&lt;ref name="equt-partners"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalityutah.org/eu/about-us/community-partners |title=Community Partners |work=Equality Utah |accessdate=January 17, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229151326/http://www.equalityutah.org/eu/about-us/community-partners |archivedate=December 29, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eqfed-members"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://equalityfederation.org/members | title=Member Organizations | work=Equality Federation | accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Equality Utah was founded in 2001 as '''Unity Utah''' and took its present name in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.equalityutah.org/about/history.html |title=Equality Utah History |accessdate=2010-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414053645/http://www.equalityutah.org/about/history.html |archivedate=2010-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Equality Utah's Common Ground Initiative brought the group national attention.&lt;ref name='nyt11'/&gt; During the campaigns for and against [[California]]'s [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|2008 Proposition 8]], leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) made statements that the LDS Church "does not object to rights for [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] regarding hospitalization and [[Health care|medical care]], [[fair housing]] and employment rights, or [[probate]] rights."&lt;ref name=nyt11 /&gt; In response, on November 10, 2008, Equality Utah proposed a number of [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] to the [[Utah State Legislature]] affording Utah citizens those rights&lt;ref&gt;[[Press release]] (November 10, 2008).

Accessed December 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and asked the LDS Church to "stand by" those statements. On December 23, 2008, [[Human Rights Campaign]] representatives delivered twenty-seven-thousand letters asking the LDS Church to support those bills; the LDS Church declined to comment on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SLTB&amp;p_theme=sltb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=125434481801A910&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=27,000 Letters Urge LDS leader to Back Rights of Gay Utahns|last=Winters|first=Rosemary|date=December 23, 2008|publisher=''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]''|accessdate=December 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In 2015, Equality Utah supported [https://le.utah.gov/~2015/bills/static/SB0296.html Utah State Bill 296], which amended the state’s Antidiscrimination and Fair Housing Acts to ensure further protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The bill also provided certain exemptions aimed at protecting religious freedom. SB 296 was passed in March 2015 by a wide margin of votes in the state house and senate. The bill’s success was attributed in large part to [https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/utah-lawmakers-introduce-bill-balancing-religious-freedom-and-nondiscrimination-protections the official endorsement of the LDS Church]. Following the senate’s vote on the bill, Equality Utah Executive Director Troy Williams [http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2259540&amp;itype=CMSID praised the bill’s impact]: "This is a stunning, historic day. I couldn't stop crying through it. This says that LGBT Utahns belong in this state. We belong here and we are being woven into the legal fabric of the state.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2259540&amp;itype=CMSID|title=Anti-discrimination bill clears Utah Senate in historic vote|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Equality Utah and the National Center for Lesbian Rights [http://fox13now.com/2016/10/24/kids-in-no-promo-homo-lawsuit-against-utah-ask-to-use-pseudonyms-in-court-over-fear-of-being-outed/ filed a lawsuit] against the Utah State Board of Education and three local school districts to contest a law prohibiting “advocacy of homosexuality” in schools. (This law and similar laws in other states are often called “[[No promo homo laws|No Promo Homo]]” laws.) The lawsuit was the first of its kind in the United States and was filed on behalf of three Utah students. The plaintiffs argued that the law limited free speech and created a hostile environment for LGBT students. The lawsuit was [http://fox13now.com/2017/03/08/utah-legislature-repeals-law-forbidding-promotion-of-homosexuality-in-schools/ put on hold] to allow the state legislature to consider a bill amending the “No Promo Homo” law, and in 2017, the state legislature passed [https://le.utah.gov/~2017/bills/static/SB0196.html Senate Bill 196], which removed the language prohibiting advocacy of homosexuality. The passage of Senate Bill 196 made Utah [https://www.advocate.com/youth/2017/10/06/utahs-no-promo-homo-law-now-history the second state to repeal a No Promo Homo law (the first being California)]. Equality Utah celebrated the change, saying it sent “a positive message that all students are valued in Utah.”

The '''Explanatory Charter''' was a supplement to the [[royal charter]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] issued by King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] on August 26, 1725.  The provincial charter, issued by [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in 1691, was modified, and certain of its terms were clarified (hence the name "explanatory" being applied to this charter).

==Background==
The issuance of the Explanatory Charter was the result of a series of disputes between the Massachusetts General Court, the elected body representing the people of the province, and the crown-appointed royal governor, [[Samuel Shute]].  In 1720 Shute claimed the authority to veto the General Court's choice of [[speaker (politics)|speaker]], and dissolved the legislature when it refused to elect someone else.  He was again upset that the legislature voted to adjourn for one week in 1721, claiming it violated his authority to control the legislature's meetings.  He raised these issues with the [[Privy Council]] of George I, which in 1725 issued the Explanatory Charter.

==Charter==
The modification of the William and Mary charter granted the governor the power to suspend the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].  It also clarified that the House of Representatives was allowed to choose its own speaker, subject to the governor's approval, and that it was allowed to adjourn for no more than two days.

==Later modifications to the Massachusetts provincial charter==
In 1766, another attempt was made to further modify the Explanatory Charter. The result was the choice of the council and [[superior court]] judges to be taken away from the legislature, appointment of sheriffs given to the governor, the selection of juries to the sheriffs, and forbade [[town meeting]]s, except for elections or by special permission of the governor.

In the wake of the 1773 [[Boston Tea Party]], the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] approved a series of acts, known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], designed to punish Massachusetts in particular.  One of these acts, the [[Massachusetts Government Act]], essentially suspended the charter and gave the crown-appointed governor wide-ranging powers.

General [[Thomas Gage]] was appointed royal governor in 1774, and implemented the Massachusetts Government Act, dissolving the provincial legislature.  Members of the legislature met anyway, and established the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]], which ''de facto'' governed most or all of Massachusetts from 1774 until the ratification of a Constitution or Form of Government for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1780.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3793">'''Feudal fascism''', also '''revolutionary-feudal totalitarianism''',&lt;ref name="Tsou"/&gt; were official terms used by the [[History of the People's Republic of China (1976–89)|post-Mao Zedong]] [[Communist Party of China]] to designate the ideology and rule of [[Lin Biao]] and the [[Gang of Four]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

== Rationale ==
In China's [[Chinese economic reform|reform and opening up]] era, the Communist Party used the phrase to frame the excesses of the Cultural Revolution as coming from individual actors, such as those in the Gang of Four, rather than to the Party as a whole.&lt;ref name="Yan"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chinese Reassessment of Socialism, 1976-1992|first=Sun|last=Yan|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Lin Biao]] and the conclusion of the Cultural Revolution, the official Communist Party interpretation was that Lin Biao and the Gang of Four represented the remnants of [[feudal]] ideology in [[China]] who had used the terrorist methods of [[fascism]] to suppress people's [[democracy]]. This characterization also allowed [[Mao Zedong]]'s successors [[Hua Guofeng]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] to renounce the 1966–1976 period without attacking Mao Zedong himself.{{fact|date=October 2012}} The methods criticized as feudal fascism included [[autocracy]], ritualized [[dogma]] and military repression.&lt;ref name="Lupher"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Power Restructuring in China and the Soviet Union|first=Mark|last=Lupher|journal=Theory and Society|volume=21|number=5|date=October 1992|pages=665–701|doi=10.1007/bf00993494}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also referred to a general lack of stable integration between the party and the state, which came from abuse of the [[mass line]] and a lack of regard to the [[Yan'an Rectification Movement|Yan'an process]] for handling inter-party dissent. 

== Effects ==
In 1977, the ''[[People's Daily]]'' ran an editorial calling for [[Elections in the People's Republic of China|more elections]] and other democratic institutions for China in order to prevent a repeat of feudal fascism.&lt;ref name="Schell"/&gt; One line from the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]] was considered particularly emblematic of feudal fascism and was stripped during the post-Cultural Revolution [[10th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|10th Congress]]: "Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism–Leninism of the era in which imperialism is heading for total collapse and socialism is advancing to world-wide victory".&lt;ref name="Tsou"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cultural Revolution and Post-Mao Reforms: A Historical Perspective|first=Tang|last=Tsou|authorlink=Tsou Tang|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1999|pages=290–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, the reformist leaders [[Hu Yaobang]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] began to [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitate]] citizens who had been labeled as [[capitalist roader]]s, bad elements and [[counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]. This sharp rise in political freedom led to the [[Democracy Wall]] movement,&lt;ref name="Schell"/&gt; with some dissidents suggesting that the period of "feudal fascism" began much earlier than the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name="Yan"/&gt; The movement grew to be such threatening to party rule that it was suppressed and reform proceeded more cautiously thereafter.&lt;ref name="Schell"&gt;{{cite book|title=Discos and Democracy: China in the Throes of Reform|first=Orville|last=Schell|publisher=Random House|year=1989|pages=270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ghost gun''' is a [[firearm]] without [[Serial code|serial numbers]]. The term is used by [[gun control]] advocates, [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] advocates,  law enforcement, and some in the firearm industry.&lt;ref name="Greenberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melendez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; By making the gun themselves, owners may legally bypass [[background check]]s and [[Firearms license|registration regulations]].&lt;ref name="Greenberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NatGeo" /&gt; Under [[Law of the United States|U.S. federal law]], the creation and possession of ghost guns is permitted, but a license is required to manufacture firearms for sale or distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/does-individual-need-license-make-firearm-personal-use|title=Does an individual need a license to make a firearm for personal use? {{!}} Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|website=www.atf.gov|language=en|access-date=October 3, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001122915/https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/does-individual-need-license-make-firearm-personal-use|archivedate=October 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

The [[lower receiver]], which in the United States is the only part legally considered a "gun" (other components may be unregulated), can be completed from an "80% receiver", one which is 80% completed before being sold legally without background or identity checks. The remaining 20% of the work may then be done using common [[drill press]] or [[Dremel]] machine tools or available hand tools.&lt;ref name="Stanton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackman"/&gt; Companies sell kits including drill bits, stencils, and jigs to aid the process, but some proficiency with the equipment may be required.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; More recently it has been possible to produce the receiver from scratch using plastic or more durable metal in a [[3D printer]], though the variety of materials and methods can create challenges in ensuring the resulting receiver is suitable for use.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; More recently [[Defense Distributed]] introduced a [[Numerical control|CNC]] mill called the "Ghost Gunner" which is optimized for the purpose of carving the lower receiver from an aluminum unfinished receiver.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;

Some ghost guns are [[AR-15]] style firearms.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; AR-15s are modular firearms and the serial number is applied to the [[lower receiver]], which holds the trigger group.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; Once an individual has an AR-15 lower receiver, they can assemble a complete weapon using widely available components, such as barrels, stocks, magazines, and upper receivers.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; Other ghost guns include pistols and AK-47 style semi-automatic rifles.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; The Philippines is a center of ghost gun production, especially .45 caliber [[semi-automatic pistol]]s.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;

== Political issues ==
Due to their lack of serial numbers, tracing ghost guns used in crimes is much harder than tracing serialized weapons.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt; There are no manufacturer or sales records to check.&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt; The difficulty means local law enforcement officers often do not even attempt traces of ghost guns.&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt;

California, especially Sacramento, has been a hub of ghost gun production.&lt;ref name="CBS2" /&gt; The ATF speculated in 2014 that there are tens of thousands of ghost guns in California alone.&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt; Four noted crimes in California were committed with ghost guns: a murder-suicide involving college students in Walnut Creek, a shootout between hostage-taking bank robbers and Stockton police officers, a [[2013 Santa Monica shooting|mass shooting at Santa Monica College]] in 2013 by a student who was prohibited from owning a gun, and a [[Rancho Tehama Reserve shootings|shooting spree at Rancho Tehama Reserve]] in 2017 by a man who was served a restraining order that barred him from possessing guns.&lt;ref name="Melendez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hurd2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS-News2"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ghost-guns-shooting-rancho-tehama-california/ |title = Shooting rampage in California highlights "ghost guns" and their dangers |work = [[CBS News]] |date = November 16, 2017 |accessdate = November 16, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171117073353/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ghost-guns-shooting-rancho-tehama-california/ |archivedate = November 17, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Proponents of ghost guns include gun rights activists and anarchists.&lt;ref name="Moody" /&gt; They say that making weapons is the right of every American which maintains the privacy of gun owners.&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt; Individuals have organized "build parties" where equipment and expertise are shared to help create ghost guns.  Advocates say that ghost guns are used in crime rarely despite widespread ownership.&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; Gun rights advocates and law enforcement say that, because of the cost and effort needed to create ghost guns, criminals are more likely to use commercial weapons instead.&lt;ref name="Hurd2" /&gt;

Two U.S. shipping companies, Federal Express and United Parcel Service, have refused to transport Ghost Gunner branded [[computer numerical control]] (CNC) milling machines.&lt;ref name="Greenberg2" /&gt;

== Legal issues ==
=== United States federal law ===

Under U.S. federal law owning a ghost gun is allowed, assuming that no other impediments exist.&lt;ref name="Greenberg" /&gt; The U.S. [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) officials characterize this as a loophole.&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt; The [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] has sued to take computer files to control 3D-printers off the internet under the grounds their publication constituted export of a munition under the [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]].&lt;ref name="Moody" /&gt;  With a legal case pending United States Supreme Court action,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reason.com/blog/2016/11/07/defense-distributed-of-3d-printed-gun-fa|title=Defense Distributed, of 3D-Printed Gun Fame, Requests Rehearing on Denial of Its Injunction Against the State Department for Crushing Its Free Speech Rights|date=2016-11-07|work=Reason.com|access-date=2017-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reason.com/blog/2017/08/14/supreme-court-asked-can-a-court-arbitrar|title=Can a Court Arbitrarily Conclude That 'Security' Overrules the First Amendment?|date=2017-08-14|work=Reason.com|access-date=2017-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Defense Distributed]] removed the files, but the censored blueprints remain accessible via [[The Pirate Bay]]'s "Physibles" section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-takes-over-distribution-of-censored-3d-printable-gun-130510/|title=

In a 2014 raid of Ares Armor, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] confiscated 6,000 receiver blanks which they said were too close to finished units.&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt;  After a lawsuit, all but 18 of the seized guns were returned and placed for sale to purchasers in 47 states.&lt;ref name="Eger2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guns.com/2017/01/30/controversial-once-seized-80-percent-lowers-now-up-for-grabs-video/|title=Controversial once-seized 80 percent lowers now up for grabs (VIDEO)|date=2017-01-30|publisher=Guns.com|author=Chris Eger}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar case, EG Armory of California was raided, but agreed to forfeit 3800 lower receivers without admission of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="Eger2"/&gt;  In Sacramento the owner of C&amp;G Tool Inc. pled guilty to illegal manufacture of firearms.  Prosecutors argued that he "advertised his shop as a place where people could make guns in 20 minutes by pressing a few buttons on a computerized machine", rejecting his position that buyers created their own guns.&lt;ref Name="CBS" /&gt;

=== California state law ===
In 2014, California attempted to enact a law to require serial numbers on unfinished receivers and all other firearms, including antique guns,&lt;ref name="Eger" /&gt; but it was vetoed by the governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.calffl.org/press-releases/california-governor-jerry-brown-vetoes-ghost-gun-ban-signs-three-gun-control-bills/ |title = California Governor Jerry Brown Vetoes “Ghost Gun” Ban, Signs Three Other Gun Control Bills |website = www.calffl.org |language = en-US |access-date = October 1, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171001122132/https://www.calffl.org/press-releases/california-governor-jerry-brown-vetoes-ghost-gun-ban-signs-three-gun-control-bills/ |archivedate = October 1, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2016, it passed a measure requiring anyone planning to build a homemade firearm to obtain a serial number from the state (''de facto'' registration) and pass a background check.&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt;

=== New York State law ===
In 2015, during the state of New York's first prosecution for sale of ghost guns, Attorney General [[Eric Schneiderman]] said it is "easy" for "criminals to make completely untraceable, military-grade firearms."&lt;ref name="Bolger" /&gt;

'''Herrenvolk democracy''' is a system of government in which only the majority [[ethnic group]] participates in government, while minority groups are [[Disenfranchisement|disenfranchised]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vickery|first=Kenneth P.|title='Herrenvolk' Democracy and Egailtarianism in South Africa and the U.S. South|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=June 1974|volume=16|issue=13|pages=309–328|jstor=17826|doi=10.1017/s0010417500012469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concepts include [[ethnic democracy]] and [[ethnocracy]]. The German term ''Herrenvolk'', "master race", was used in 19th century discourse that justified [[colonialism]] with the racial superiority of Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gründer|first1=Horst|editor1-last=Beck|editor1-first=Thomas|title=Überseegeschichte|date=1999|publisher=F. Steiner|location=Stuttgart|isbn=9783515074902|pages=254 et seq.|chapter=Ideologie und Praxis des deutschen Kolonialismus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
This [[elitist]] form of government is typically employed by the majority group as a way to maintain control and power within the system, and typically coincides with the false pretense of [[egalitarianism]].  There is a prevailing view that as people of the majority gain [[Free will|freedom]], [[liberty]], and egalitarian principles are advanced, the minority is [[repressed]] and prevented from being involved in the government. This principle can be seen in the development of both the [[United States]]—especially the [[American South|Southern states]]—and [[South Africa]] in the 19th and 20th centuries.  In these historical scenarios, as legislation moved toward universal male [[suffrage]] for whites, it also further entrenched the prevention of black people from participation in government and upheld their disenfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vickery|first=Kenneth P.|title='Herrenvolk' Democracy and Egalitarianism in South Africa and the U.S. South|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=June 1974|volume=16|issue=3|pages=311–315|jstor=17826|doi=10.1017/s0010417500012469}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in 1967 by [[Pierre L. van den Berghe|Pierre van Den Berghe]] in his book ''Race and Racism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van den Berghe|first=Pierre L.|title=Race and Racism: A Comparative Perspective. |location= NY; Sydney |publisher= Wiley|date=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilan Pappé]] has controversially used the term to describe the current government of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BARAT|first1=FRANK|title=Why Israel is Not a Democracy|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/04/01/why-israel-is-not-a-democracy/|accessdate=15 September 2014|quote="[[Ilan Pappé]]: No, Israel is definitely not a democracy. A country that occupies another people for more than 40 years and disallow them the most elementary civic and human rights cannot be a democracy. A country that pursues a discriminatory policy against a fifth of its Palestinian citizens inside the 67 borders cannot be a democracy. In fact Israel is, what we use to call in political science a herrenvolk democracy, its democracy only for the masters. The fact that you allow people to participate in the formal side of democracy, namely to vote or to be elected, is useless and meaningless if you don’t give them any share in the common good or in the common resources of the State, or if you discriminate against them despite the fact that you allow them to participate in the elections. On almost every level from official legislation through governmental practices, and social and cultural attitudes, Israel is only a democracy for one group, one ethnic group, that given the space that Israel now controls, is not even a majority group anymore, so I think that you’ll find it very hard to use any known definition of democracy which will be applicable for the Israeli case."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Wages of Whiteness'', historian [[David R. Roediger]] reinterprets this form of government in the context of 19th-century America, arguing that the term "''herrenvolk'' republicanism" more accurately describes racial politics at this time. The basis of herrenvolk republicanism went beyond the [[marginalization]] of blacks in favor of a [[republican government]] serving the "master race"; it contended that "blackness" was synonymous with dependency and servility, and was therefore antithetical to republican independence and white freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roediger|first=David R.|title=The Wages of Whiteness|year=1997|publisher=Verso|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781844671458|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the dependent white worker at this time used his whiteness as a way to differentiate himself from and elevate himself over the dependent black worker or slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roediger|first=David R.|title=The Wages of Whiteness|year=1997|publisher=Verso|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781844671458|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this ideology, blacks were not merely "non-citizens"; they were "anti-citizens" who inherently opposed the ideals of a republican government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blevins|first=Cameron|title=U.S. History Qualifying Exams: Book Summaries: The Wages of Whiteness|url=http://cameronblevins.org/cblevins/Quals/BookSummaries/Roediger_TheWagesofWhiteness.html|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">'''[[Homelessness]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]''' is a significant issue in [[Port Moresby]], the nation's capital city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hausples.com.pg/news/growth-costs-opportunities-homelessness-papua-new-guinea/|title=Growth, Costs and Opportunities of Homelessness in Papua New Guinea|website=www.hausples.com.pg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth homelessness==
It is estimated that the homeless population in the nation's capital includes over 5,000 homeless children. The government and charities working in the region state that migration from rural to urban areas are a leading cause for the rise in homelessness.&lt;ref name=abc1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-26/png-government-vows-to-find-shelter-for-port-moresbys-homeless/9587412|title=PNG Government vows to find shelter for Port Moresby's homeless children|date=26 March 2018|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working street children===
One study on working [[street children]] in Papua New Guinea surveyed 324 children, of which seven percent were currently living on the street, but overall, 51% had been living on the street at one point in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Kritoe Keleba with Nancy Sullivan. ''Working Street Children of Papua New Guinea''. Department for Community Development, Child Welfare Branch. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Following natural disasters==
Other instances of homelessness include families who have lost their homes due to natural disasters. In 2017, around 500 people became homeless following floods in the Eastern Highlands Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pireport.org/articles/2017/01/04/500-homeless-pngs-eastern-highlands-province-after-flooding|title=500 Homeless In PNG's Eastern Highlands Province After Flooding - Pacific Islands Report|website=www.pireport.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, some 13,000 people became homeless following flooding in the Northern Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2007/12/png-d06.html|title=Papua New Guinea flood leaves thousands homeless|first=Will|last=Marshall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government responses==

===Legislation===

A '''housing affordability index''' is an index that rates [[Affordable housing|housing affordability]].  

==United States==
One is published monthly by the [[National Association of Realtors]]. A value of 100 means that a family with the median income has exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. An index above 100 signifies that family earning the median income has more than enough income to qualify for a mortgage loan on a median-priced home, assuming a 20 percent down payment and a qualifying ratio of 25 percent. For example, a composite HAI of 120.0 means a family earning the median family income has 120% of the income necessary to qualify for a conventional loan covering 80 percent of a median-priced existing single-family home. &lt;ref name="realtor"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realtor.org/topics/housing-affordability-index/methodology | title=Methodology About the Index | publisher=National Association of Realtors | date=nd | accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  National as well as regional data is published.

'''Inosinic acid''' or '''inosine monophosphate''' ('''IMP''') is a [[nucleoside]] monophosphate. Widely used as a flavor enhancer, it is typically obtained from chicken byproducts or other [[meat industry]] waste.  Inosinic acid is important in [[metabolism]].  It is the [[ribonucleotide]] of [[hypoxanthine]] and the first nucleotide formed during the synthesis of [[purine]].  It is formed by the [[deamination]] of [[adenosine monophosphate]], and is [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] to [[inosine]]. IMP is an intermediate [[ribonucleoside monophosphate]] in [[purine metabolism]]. The enzyme deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase, encoded by YJR069C in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and containing (d)ITPase and (d)XTPase activities, hydrolyzes [[inosine triphosphate]] (ITP) releasing [[pyrophosphate]] and IMP.&lt;ref name="pmid 22531138"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davies O, Mendes P, Smallbone K, Malys N | title = Characterisation of multiple substrate-specific (d)ITP/(d)XTPase and modelling of deaminated purine nucleotide metabolism | journal = BMB Reports | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 259–64 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22531138| doi = 10.5483/BMBRep.2012.45.4.259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important derivatives of inosinic acid include purine nucleotides found in [[nucleic acid]]s and [[adenosine triphosphate]], which is used to store [[chemical energy]] in [[muscle]] and other tissues.

In the food industry, inosinic acid and its [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] such as [[disodium inosinate]] are used as [[flavor enhancer]]s.

==Inosinate synthesis==
The inosinate synthesis is complex, beginning with a [[Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate|5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate]] (PRPP). In the first step, an amino group given by glutamine is attached at carbon 1 of PRPP. The resulting molecule is 5-phosphoribosylamine, which is highly unstable, with a half-life of 30 seconds at physiologic [[pH]]. 5-Phosphoribosylamine gains an amino acid ([[glycine]]), becoming glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR). Then, N10-formyltetrahydrofolate ([[tetrahydrofolate]]) transfers a formyl group to glycinamide ribonucleotide to form formyl glycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR).
[[File:Nucleotides syn1.png|left|thumb|350px|This figure shows the pathway described: IMP synthesis.]]
Using an [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecule, [[glutamine]] donates an [[ammonia]]{{Dubious|date=August 2010}} molecule which is added to the compound forming formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide. Another ATP molecule causes an intermolecular reaction that produces an [[imidazole]] ring (5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide).

The next step of the pathway is adding [[bicarbonate]] to make carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide by using ATP (it only happens in [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]]; high [[eukaryotes]] simply add CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form the ribonucleotide). Then, the imidazole’s carboxylate group phosphatises and adds [[aspartate]].

This six-step process links [[glycine]], [[formate]], [[bicarbonate]], [[glutamine]], and [[aspartate]] to lead to an intermediate that contains almost all the required atoms to synthesize a [[purine ring]]. This intermediate removes [[fumarate]], and a second formyl group from THF is added. The compound gets cycled and forms inosinate{{Dubious|date=August 2010}} after a sort of intermolecular reactions. Inosinate is the first intermediate in this synthesis pathway to have a whole purine ring.

[[Enzymes]] taking part in IMP synthesis constitute a multienzyme complex in the cell. Evidences demonstrate that there are multifunctional enzymes, and some of them catalyze non-sequential steps in the pathway.

==Adenylate (AMP) and guanylate (GMP) come from inosinate==
Within a few steps inosinate becomes [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]] or [[Guanosine monophosphate|GMP]]. Both compounds are [[RNA]] [[nucleotides]].
AMP differs from inosinate by the replacement of IMP's carbon-6 carbonyl with an amino group. The interconversion of AMP and IMP occurs as part of the [[purine nucleotide cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Voet, D, Voet, J. G., Biochemistry (3rd Edition), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2004, pg 1095&lt;/ref&gt;
GMP is formed by the inosinate oxidation to [[xanthylate]] (XMP), and afterwards adds an amino group on carbon 2. Hydrogen acceptor on inosinate oxidation is [[NAD+]]. Finally, carbon 2 gains the amino group by spending an ATP molecule (which becomes AMP+2Pi).
While AMP synthesis requires GTP, GMP synthesis uses ATP. That difference offers an important regulation possibility.

[[File:PDB 1ecb EBI.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Glutamine-PRPP-amidotransferase]]

==Inosinate takes part in the regulation of purine nucleotides biosynthesis==
Inosinate and many other molecules inhibit the synthesis of 5-phosphorybosilamine from 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), disabling the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction: glutamine-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate-amidotransferase. In other words, when levels of inosinate are high, glutamine-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate-amidotransferase is inhibited, and, as a consequence, inosinate levels decrease. Also, as a result, adenylate and guanylate are not produced, which means that RNA synthesis cannot be completed because of the lack of these two important RNA nucleotides.

==Applications==
Inosinic acid can be converted into various [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] including [[disodium inosinate]] (E631), [[dipotassium inosinate]] (E632), and [[dicalcium inosinate]] (E633).  These three compounds are used as [[flavor enhancer]]s for the basic taste [[umami]] with a comparatively high effectiveness. They are mostly used in soups, sauces, and seasonings for the intensification and balance of the flavor of meat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14608">'''Inter-municipal cooperation''' ('''IMC''') is a generic term for all joint provision of public services between municipalities, who are normally but not necessarily neighbours.

Municipalities are elements of administration and have a history of several hundred years in Europe.&lt;ref name=Hulst&gt;{{cite book|last=Hulst|first=Rudie|title=Inter-Municipal Cooperation|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Amsterdam|isbn=1-4020-5378-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One speaks of IMC when two or more municipalities work together to provide a public service, where cooperation ranges from coordinated behaviour to joint ventures. As territorial consolidation often fails because of political resistance, inter-municipal cooperation is a way to keep public services efficient and effective without territorial consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Local Government and Public Reform Initiative|title=When is IMC relevant?|url=http://www.municipal-cooperation.org/index.php?title=When_is_IMC_relevant%3F|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BelWarner&gt;{{cite web|last=Bel, Germa, and Mildred E. Warner (2015)|title=Inter-municipal Cooperation and Costs: Expectation and Evidence|url=https://cardi.cals.cornell.edu/sites/cardi.cals.cornell.edu/files/shared/documents/RED/Intermunicipal%20Cooperation%20and%20costs.pdf|publisher=Public Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, IMC can have high failure rates when coordination problems between municipalities in steering and monitoring cannot be resolved.&lt;ref name=Voornetal&gt;{{cite web|last=Voorn, Bart, Marieke L. Van Genugten, and Sandra Van Thiel (2017)|title=The efficiency and effectiveness of municipally owned corporations: a systematic review|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03003930.2017.1319360|publisher=Local Government Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorensen&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorensen, Rune J.

== History ==
Cooperation of municipalities is a contemporary phenomenon. A historic example of inter-municipal cooperation is the Hanseatic League,&lt;ref name=FES&gt;{{cite web|last=Froecker|first=Hans-Joerd|title=Interkommunale Zusammenarbeit|url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/akademie/kommunal/05825.pdf|publisher=Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by municipalities in Northern Europe and lasted from the 13th to the 17th century. Following the Industrial Revolution, as cities grew rapidly and the requirements concerning public services increased, inter-municipal cooperation became increasingly popular. While cooperation was initially without obligation, with the beginning of the 20th century IMC was increasingly legally codified.

== Benefits and Barriers ==
=== Benefits ===
IMC is used to increase efficiency and effectiveness in providing public services.&lt;ref name=BelWarner /&gt; The joint financing and operating of these services can cut costs and achieve economies of scale and scope, which becomes increasingly important in smaller and more rural municipalities. IMC can also allow capital investment that would be unaffordable otherwise, and eliminates duplicate efforts. A major advantage in Europe is that the European Union is providing incentives for municipal partnerships.

=== Barriers ===
The most important barrier for inter-municipal cooperation is lack of trust or coordination between the partners, and if these cannot be overcome, failure rates of IMC can be high.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt; Politicians and citizens may (rightfully) fear a loss of control over the service.&lt;ref name=Spicer&gt;{{cite web|last=Spicer, Zachary (2017)|title=Bridging the accountability and transparency gap in inter-municipal collaboration|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03003930.2017.1288617|publisher=Local Government Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the lack of trust, the often complicated legal structure of IMC can be a barrier. Citizens may also worry that cooperation is a step towards consolidation or amalgamation.

== Types of Inter-municipal Cooperation ==

=== Coordinated Behaviour ===
Coordinated behaviour is the lowest level of inter-municipal cooperation. Both entry and exit are voluntary and non-binding.&lt;ref name=LeRouxetal&gt;{{cite web|last=LeRoux, Kelly, Paul W. Brandenburger, and Sanjay K. Pandey (2010)|title=Interlocal service cooperation in US cities: A social network explanation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02133.x/full|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples for coordinated behaviour are combined strategies for tourist development.

=== Public Contract ===
Public contracts are more binding than a coordinated behaviour. The costs for the formation of this cooperation are low as only the legal consulting may result noteworthy costs. However, failure rates can be high when contracts are incomplete.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt; This kind of cooperation is typically chosen when the service is similar for each of the participants, like one town settles the snow plowing service for one or more other towns and receives a certain amount of money in return. Such inter-municipal contracting is particularly common in the United States.&lt;ref name=BelWarner /&gt;

=== Administration Unit / Special District ===
In this model, the participants of the intermunicipal cooperation found and own the administration unit or special district. They transfer the right to provide the public service to the newly formed unit. As well as the service, the unit will have the right to raise the fees for this service, if such fees were previously raised by the participating municipalities. As these units need clear defined rights and obligation the effort to form them is much higher, and they are not possible in all countries.&lt;ref name=HMWVL&gt;{{cite web|last=Hessen Ministry of Economy, Traffic and Development|title=Interkommunale Kooperation|url=http://www.stadtumbau-hessen.de/tiny_docman/files/Pub_Interk_Koperation.pdf|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disposal services and water supply may be organised in this fashion in some countries.

=== Private Limited Company ===
Private law units such as companies or foundations can be used as well. Some countries, so as Germany, allow the municipals the ownership of private companies only if the purpose of the company is an economical not a public service. The easiest way to form a company by private law is the [[private limited company]]. It is easy and fast to found and the liability is limited to the assets of the company. However, while research shows such cooperation can be effective and efficient, the complexity of contracts in such arrangements can also lead to high failure rates.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt;

=== Public Limited Company ===
To organise an intermunicipal cooperation with a public law unit such as a [[public limited company]] is one of the least used possibilities. Although the PLC shares the advantages of the Private Limited like limited liability the higher administration and financial effort makes the PLC rather unattractive for IMC. Besides that the PLC is often very difficult to control by the owners what rules is almost out for IMC. Just like private limited companies, public limited companies may have a high complexity of contracts that can also lead to high failure rates.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt;

== Phases of implementing IMC ==
The phases to implement an IMC can be divided in up to 14 phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishing IMC|url=http://www.municipal-cooperation.org/index.php?title=Establishing_IMC|publisher=Local Government and Public Reform Initiative|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually it is enough to distinguish four phases: the analysis of the needs, the analysis of the effects, the implementation and the evaluation.

At first one has to perform a needs assessment to find the areas in which IMC can benefit the participants. What is needed is an exact specification of the goals the IMC should achieve. The parties have to realize what they want and make sure that the partner has similar goals. Especially in the area of public services, where there is a constant dialogue with citizens about these services, it is important to make the process and the goals as transparent as possible. Citizens can be involved in the process of forming the IMC by using workshops or panel discussions.

After that, a feasibility study is needed to analyse the economic, operational and administrative efforts and benefits. If the service to be organised as an IMC already exists, it needs to be exactly specified. All the facts flow into the negotiation of the agreement, whether it is a contract, an administrative unit or a private company. At this point the involved parties should be clear about the form of financing the IMC. It can be advisable to seek legal advice as IMC can become legally very difficult in some countries.

When everything is fixed in contracts the participants can start to realise the project. As well as in the first phase of the IMC implementation it is important to communicate the process to all involved parties. Especially when problems arise, transparent behaviour is needed to sustain trust between the involved parties.

After the successful implementation of the project, the parties should negotiate certain progress of improvement an adjustment to changing environmental conditions. It is advisable to establish the “change management” in the contract between the involved parties. There should be a periodical evaluation of the IMC so that changed prerequisites will be noticed.

== Inter-municipal Cooperation in international area ==

=== Belgium ===
By a framework decree of 2001, inter-municipal cooperation was reformed by the [[Flemish]] Government. A variety of forms of inter-municipal cooperation were legally implemented. Beside that certain elements of supervision were implemented, to ensure control by the municipal councils. The framework insists on the "purity" of IMC, so municipalities shall be involved primarily.&lt;ref name=Hulst /&gt;

=== Finland ===
Especially in the thinly populated [[Finland]] inter-municipal cooperation has been an effective tool to ensure public services at reasonable cost. Finnish local governments are self-governing with a large variety of responsibilities. Due to this fact the services provided by the municipals are numerous. Even service competition between municipals is quite common in Finland.&lt;ref name=Hulst /&gt;

=== France ===
[[France]] was long time mainly governed by a central state. Within the last century the municipals gained more and more autonomy. Nevertheless inter-municipal is often performed on voluntary basis. As discussing about territorial consolidation is politically hazardous in France, IMC becomes more and more important to maintain public services at reasonable costs.&lt;ref name=Hulst /&gt;

=== Germany ===
Inter-municipal cooperation has a long history in [[Germany]]. In the administrative system of Germany (State, Federal States, Communities) the municipals have to finance their services themselves. Therefore municipals have a natural interest in providing public services efficiently.&lt;ref name=Hulst /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In contrast to other European Countries local governments are highly restricted in the United Kingdom. Therefore inter-municipal cooperation is not that common in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly, Josephine (2007)|title=The Curious Absence of Inter-municipal Cooperation in England |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0952076707078763|publisher=Public Policy and Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although municipalities have the authority to perform public services they often do not have the possibility to raise additional fees.&lt;ref name=Hulst /&gt;

=== United States of America ===
There are 39,000 local governments United States and 22,000 have under 2,500 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Michael E.|title=Inter-municipal Cooperation in the USA|url=http://government.cce.cornell.edu/doc/pdf/UPER6artWARNER.pdf|publisher=Urban Public Economics Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides providing public services themselves, municipalities in the USA have used privatization (contracting out) and cooperation with neighbouring municipalities for a long period of time. Cooperation is used to maintain independent identities and still achieve economies of scale. Most of the cooperative ventures are single-function (education, water, housing, transport).

The '''International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking''' is a [[United Nations]] [[International Day]] against [[drug abuse]] and the [[illegal drug trade]]. It is observed annually on 26 June, since 1989, a date chosen to commemorate [[Lin Zexu]]'s dismantling of the [[opium]] trade in [[Humen Town|Humen]], [[Guangdong]], just before the [[First Opium War]] in China.{{Citation needed|reason=The UN makes no mention of this being the reason the date was chosen.|date=March 2014}} The observance was instituted by [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|Resolution]] 42/112 of 7 December 1987. It is often referred to by Anti-Drug campaigners as 6/26. A play on Marijuana smokers "4/20" day to celebrate cannabis.

The UN's 2007 [[World Drug Report]]&lt;ref name="WDR"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/index.html World Drug Report 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Harry Dunning''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (26 June 1927 – 29 January 2009) was a British economist and is widely recognised as the father of the field of [[international business]]. He researched the economics of international direct investment and the multinational enterprise from the 1950s until his death.&lt;ref name="aib" /&gt; In the 1980s, he published the [[eclectic paradigm]] or OLI-Model/Framework as further development on [[Internalization theory]]. OLI remains the predominant theoretical perspective to study international business activities, notably [[foreign direct investment]] and [[multinational corporation|multinational enterprises]]. His first book, ''American Investment in British Manufacturing Industry'' (1958), is the first seminal work in the international business field.

== Biography ==
John Dunning was born in [[Sandy, Bedfordshire]] on 26 June 1927. At the age of 15 he took a junior clerical position with S.E. Higgins &amp; Co., a London insurance brokerage.&lt;ref name="Dunning 2008"&gt;Dunning (2008)''Seasons of a Scholar: Some Personal Reflections of an International Business Economist'', Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, UK and Northampton, MA&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter he took a position in London with Banco de Bilbao and began taking classes in English, Elements of Banking and Accounting, and Foreign Exchange.&lt;ref name="Dunning 2008"/&gt;

As World War II drew to a close, Dunning joined the [[Royal Navy]] and was posted to [[Sri Lanka]] (then called Ceylon) in 1945.&lt;ref name="Dunning 2008"/&gt; Upon completing his naval tour, he earned his BSc in Economics from the [[University College London]]. He joined the Department of Economics at the [[University of Southampton]] in 1952 as an assistant lecturer and earned the position of senior lecturer in 1962. In 1953 Dunning began research on the FDI of American firms into the UK and its effect on UK economic performance, which resulted in the seminal 1958 book, ''American Investment in British Manufacturing Industry''.

In 1964 Dunning was appointed Foundation Chair of Economics at the [[University of Reading]]. During his tenure as head of the economics department at Reading, he published much of his influential work on the [[eclectic paradigm]]. He and other Reading colleagues published work on the theory of the multinational enterprise that influenced the academic field of international business to such a degree that the stream of MNE research based on the [[eclectic paradigm]] is considered [[the Reading School of International Business]].

There are two institutions greatly influenced by John Dunning, one of which he created and one which he presided over and took to new heights. The first of these is the University of Reading, where he created a rich intellectual environment, starting in the 1970s, in which deep theoretical analysis and rich empirical work was fostered to explain the activities of multinational enterprise. He recruited scholars to the University who included [[Mark Casson]], [[Peter Buckley (academic)|Peter Buckley]], John Cantwell, [[Bob Pierce]], [[Rajneesh Narula]], Klaus Meyer, [[Sarianna Lundan]], and many others who have made significant scholarly contributions. Dunning supervised several dozen doctoral students at Reading, prominent among them being [[Jeremy Clegg]]. Dunning subsequently started a doctoral program in international business at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]], United States.

The second institution fostered by Dunning is the [[Academy of International Business]], of which he served as President and also as Dean of the Fellows of AIB. Dunning regularly presented new papers and inspired new areas of research, such as his recent work on corporate governance and the ethics of multinationals. Dunning was also a founder of the [[European International Business Academy (EIBA)|European International Business Academy]].

Since August 2008 the triple-accredited Henley Business School at the University of Reading has been home to the John H. Dunning Centre for International Business, formerly the Centre for International Business and Strategy (CIBS). The Centre was renamed in 2008, in honour of the late professor Dunning, and stands as one of the world's premier research centres in the field. Internationally renowned members of the Centre include professors [[Alan Rugman]], Mark Casson and Rajneesh Narula (one of Dunning's notable doctoral students, and the founding director of Dunning Centre).

Dunning died on 29 January 2009, a year after being diagnosed with cancer.&lt;ref name="aib" /&gt; In the same year, ''[[Journal of International Business Studies]],'' the most prestigious academic journal in international business, commented, "John Dunning is widely recognized as the father of the field of international business" and "Today, John's influence is demonstrated by a citation count on [[Google Scholar]] of over 30,000, many times that of any other scholar in the field of international business."

==Biosynthesis==
&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-Labeling studies have revealed at least two pathways to kojic acid.  In the usual route, dehydratase enzymes convert glucose to kojic acid. Pentoses are also viable precursors in which case [[dihydroxyacetone]] is invoked as an intermediate.&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt;

==Applications==
Kojic acid may be used on cut fruits to prevent [[redox|oxidative browning]], in [[seafood]] to preserve pink and red colors, and in cosmetics to lighten skin.  As an example of the latter, it is used to treat skin diseases like [[melasma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aad.org/public/publications/pamphlets/common_melasma.html Melasma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223080148/http://www.aad.org/public/publications/pamphlets/common_melasma.html |date=2009-12-23 }}, American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/ref&gt; Kojic acid also has antibacterial and antifungal properties.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Protective effects from radiation-induced damage==
Kojic acid appears to possess marked protective ([[radioresistance]]) effects from radiation-induced damage. It increased the 30-day survival rate of mice after exposed to a lethal dose of gamma radiation and had significant radioprotective effects on the hematopoietic system, the immune system and DNA of mice exposed to a 4 Gy sublethal dose of radiation. Pretreatment with kojic acid has been shown to protect Chinese hamster ovary cells against ionizing radiation-induced damage. Dogs pretreated with kojic acid after whole-body exposure to a lethal dose of 3 Gy gamma radiation had a 51-day survival rate of 66.7% versus the dogs in the 3 Gy irradiation only group, which all died within 16 days of postirradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Kai | last2 = Li | first2 = Peng-Fei | last3 = Han | first3 = Chun-Guang | last4 = Du | first4 = Li | last5 = Liu | first5 = Chao | last6 = Hu | first6 = Ming | last7 = Lian | first7 = Shi-Jie | last8 = Liu | first8 = Yong-Xue | year = 2014 | title = Protective Effects of Kojic Acid on the Periphery Blood and Survival of Beagle Dogs after Exposure to a Lethal Dose of Gamma Radiation | url = | journal = Radiation Research | volume = 182 | issue = 6| pages = 666–673 | doi = 10.1667/RR13823.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lange model''' (or '''Lange–Lerner theorem''') is a [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic]] model for a hypothetical socialist economy based on public ownership of the [[means of production]] and a trial-and-error approach to determining output targets and achieving [[economic equilibrium]] and [[Pareto efficiency]]. In this model, the state owns non-labor factors of production, and markets allocate final goods and consumer goods. The Lange model states that if all production is performed by a public body such as the state, and there is a functioning price mechanism, this economy will be Pareto-efficient, like a hypothetical [[market economy]] under [[perfect competition]]. Unlike models of capitalism, the Lange model is based on direct allocation, by directing enterprise managers to set price equal to [[marginal cost]] in order to achieve Pareto efficiency. By contrast, in a capitalist economy managers are instructed to maximize profits for private owners, while competitive pressures are relied on to indirectly lower the price to equal marginal cost.

This model was first proposed by [[Oskar R. Lange]] in 1936 during the [[socialist calculation debate]], and was expanded by economists like H. D. Dickinson, [[Abba P. Lerner]] and [[Fred M. Taylor]]. Although Lange and Lerner called it "[[market socialism]]", the Lange model is a form of planned economy where a central planning board allocates investment and capital goods, while markets allocate labor and consumer goods. The planning board simulates a market in capital goods by a trial-and-error process first elaborated by [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Léon Walras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03085149800000027| title = Socialism against markets? A critique of two recent proposals| journal = Economy and Society| volume = 27| issue = 4| pages = 407–433| year = 1998| last1 = Hodgson | first1 = G. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lange model has never been implemented anywhere, not even in Oskar Lange's home country, [[Poland]], where [[Soviet-type economic planning]] was imposed after World War II, precluding experimentation with Lange-style economy.&lt;ref name="Post-Lange Socialism: An Evaluation of Profit-Oriented Proposals, 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yunker | first1 = James A. | year = 1995 | title = Post-Lange Market Socialism: An Evaluation of Profit-Oriented Proposals | journal = Journal of Economic Issues | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 683–717 | publisher =  | jstor = 4226984 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | doi=10.1080/00213624.1995.11505705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parallels might be drawn with the [[New Economic Mechanism]] or so-called [[Goulash Communism]] in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] under [[János Kádár|Kádár]], although this was not a pure Lange-model system.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Thomas. "The Lessons of Limited Market-Oriented Reform" (1991), The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 5, No. 4 (Autumn, 1991), pp. 45-58&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The model is sometimes called the "Lange–Lerner" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bator|first=Francis M.|title=The Anatomy of Market Failure|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=August 1958|volume=72|issue=3|pages=351–379|jstor=1882231|doi=10.2307/1882231}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abba Lerner]] wrote a series of articles that greatly influenced Lange's thinking. For example, Lerner (1938) caused Lange to re-write his 1936 and 1937 articles on [[market socialism]], before they were re-published as chapters in a 1938 book. Lerner (1938) influenced Lange's thinking on [[social dividend]] payments. Lerner (1944) also argued that investment in the Lange model would inevitably be politicized.

The Lange model was developed in response to [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s [[criticisms of socialism]] during the [[socialist calculation debate]]. The critics argued that any body that owns and consolidates a society's means of production cannot acquire the information needed to calculate general equilibrium prices, and that market-determined prices were essential for the rational allocation of producer goods. The Lange model contains principles proposed by neoclassical economists [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Léon Walras]]. Lange's theory emphasizes the idea of Pareto efficiency: a situation is Pareto-efficient if there is no way to rearrange things to make any individual better off without making anyone worse off. To achieve Pareto efficiency, a set of conditions must be formulated in stages. This idea of deriving conditions to ensure that consumer preferences are in balance with the maximum amount of goods and services produced is emphasized by Walras. The theorem indicates that a socialist economy based on public ownership could achieve one of the principal economic benefits of capitalism - a rational price system - and was an important theoretical force behind the development of the concept of [[market socialism]].

== Basic principles ==

[[File:Lange_model_diagram.svg|alt=|thumb|367x367px|A chart to show how the model would hypothetically function.]]
{{Economics sidebar}}
The Lange model suggests three levels of decision-making. The lowest level contains firms and households, the intermediate level contains industrial ministries, and the highest level is the central planning board. The board sets the initial price of consumer goods arbitrarily and informs the producing firms of these prices.  The state-owned firms then produce at the level of output where [[marginal cost]] equals price, P = MC, so as to minimize the cost of production. At the intermediate level, industrial ministries determine the sectoral expansion of industry.  Households decide how to allocate income and how much labor to supply by choosing between work and leisure.

=== Institutions ===
The key institutions of the Lange model include the central planning board (CPB), industrial ministries for each economic sector, and state enterprises [[Workplace democracy|managed democratically]] by their employees.

=== Trial-and-error price adjustments ===
Because prices are set by the central planning board "artificially" aiming to achieve planned growth objectives, it is unlikely that supply and demand will be in equilibrium at first. To produce the correct amount of goods and services, the Lange model suggests a trial-and-error method. If there is a surplus of a particular good, the central planning board lowers the price of that good. Conversely, if there is a shortage of a good, the board raises the price. This process of price adjustments takes place until equilibrium between supply and demand is achieved.

=== Central planning board ===
The central planning board (CPB) has three major functions in the Lange model: First it instructs firms to set price to equal marginal cost, secondly it adjusts prices to attain market-clearing prices for goods and services, and finally, it reinvests the economic profit derived from state enterprises into the economy based on a target rate of growth. The central planning board also distributes social dividends to the population.

=== Social dividend ===
Apart from setting prices, the central planning board allocates [[social dividend]]s. Because all non-labor factors of production are publicly owned, the rents and profits of these resources belong to the public. The profits would be used to finance a social dividend scheme based on the individuals' share in the income derived from the socially owned capital and natural resources, providing a complimentary source of income for workers alongside their salaries and wages.&lt;ref name="On the Economic Theory of Socialism, 1936"&gt;''On the Economic Theory of Socialism'', by Lange, Oskar. 1936. The Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 4, No. 1: "It seems, therefore, convenient to regard the income of consumers as being composed of two parts: one part being the receipts for the labour services performed and the other part being a social dividend constituting the individual's share in the income derived from the capital and the natural resources owned by society."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
The Lange economic model has a number of theoretical advantages. One advantage is public control over investment. The rate of economic growth would be largely state-determined and a major determinant would be investment ratio.

Another advantage argued by Lange was that [[externalities]] could be better accounted for, thanks to the state's ability to manipulate resource prices.  Because the state controls all firms, they could easily factor the cost of an externality into the price of a certain resource.  Because decisions are made at higher rather than lower levels, it is argued that these decisions are less likely to have undesirable environmental consequences.

Furthermore, because the state uses [[marginal cost pricing]] and determines entry, Langean socialism can avoid monopolies and the accompanying lack of [[allocative efficiency]] and [[x-inefficiency|x-efficiency]].

The model claims to solve another main criticism of [[capitalism]].  Lange believed that his model would reduce cyclical instability because the state would control savings and investment, consequently eliminating a major source of inefficiency, inequality and social instability that arises from violent cyclical shifts under capitalism.

== Criticisms ==
[[Milton Friedman]] criticized the Lange model on methodological grounds. According to Friedman, the model rested on 'models of imaginary worlds' rather than 'generalizations about the real world', making the claims of the model immune to falsification.  He also criticized the model on logical grounds, by pointing out that any system which posits state ownership of enterprise requires the continuous intervention by force from the state: any time an individual started a private enterprise, the state must either shut it down or seize it, or use force to deter individuals from starting private enterprises in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman, 'Lange on Price Flexibility and Employment', ''Essays in Positive Economics''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2017}}

The following list provides information relating to the [[minimum wage]]s (gross) of in the [[European Union]] [[EU member states|member states]].

The calculations are based on the assumption of a 40-hour working week and a 52-week year, with the exceptions of [[France]] (35 hours),&lt;ref name="eurostat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Minimum_wage_statistics|title=Minimum wage statistics|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=27 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgium]] (38 hours),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.belgium.be/en/work/employment_legislation Employment legislation]&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom]] (38.1 hours),&lt;ref name="eurostat"/&gt; [[Ireland]] (39 hours),&lt;ref name="eurostat"/&gt; and [[Germany]] (39.1 hours).&lt;ref name="eurostat"/&gt;

Most of minimum wages are fixed at a monthly rate, but there are countries where minimum wage is fixed at an hourly rate or weekly rate.

{{Policy Debate}}

The '''Louisville Project''' is a project by the [[University of Louisville|University of Louisville's]] [[policy debate|policy debate team]] (the '''University of Louisville Debate Society''' or '''ULDS''') to increase meaningful [[Minority group|minority]] participation in debate, which started in 2000.

==Mission==
Led by coach Ede Warner, Louisville eschewed traditional forms of debating like speed reading, debating the [[resolution (policy debate)|resolution]], and presenting traditional forms of [[evidence (policy debate)|evidence]].  Louisville instead uses [[hip hop music]], personal experiences, and other media to present their arguments. They argue that many elements of policy debate are exclusionary and ask the judge to cast their ballot to sign onto their project to increase diversity in debate.

In 2005, Louisville started a "take it to the streets" initiative in which they offered to debate the topic normally if the [[judge (policy debate)|judge]] was replaced with a lay person. Because of the time required to find a new critic, the rounds were to take place with [[Structure of policy debate|reduced speech times]], approximately equivalent to those of [[Lincoln-Douglas debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ndtceda.com/archives/200511/0030.html  |accessdate=2006-01-10 |df= }}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most teams accepted the agreement and Louisville lost the vast majority of those debates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndtceda.com/archives/200511/0047.html]{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the project==
In November 2005, Ede Warner announced, on the collegiate debate message board [[eDebate]], his resignation as the [[Cross Examination Debate Association]] 2nd vice president,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ndtceda.com/archives/200511/0264.html  |accessdate=2006-01-10 |df= }}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; canceled the University of Louisville's [[Policy debate competitions|debate tournament]] (the "Super Bowl of Debate"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ndtceda.com/archives/200511/0255.html  |accessdate=2006-01-10 |df= }}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced his plans to stop recruiting debaters and retire in 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ndtceda.com/archives/200511/0241.html  |accessdate=2006-01-10 |df= }}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is regarded by many in the debate community as the beginning of the end of the Louisville Project.

==MPOWER Movement==
Louisville has continued "The Project" through the 2006–2007 season and has now become self-titled as the MPOWER (Multi-cultural policy organizing with emancipatory rhetoric) Movement. The MPOWER Movement seeks to implement policies into the debate community that will enhance multi-cultural education in collegiate debate. Louisville advocates a 10-demand plan which was distributed to the debate community during the 2006–07 season at competitions. The team uses these points to support their argument that collegiate debate is currently exclusive of minority groups based on race, economics, gender, sexuality and communicative differences. The success of the Louisville team fluctuated during the 2006–07 season. In the end, two teams qualified for elimination rounds at CEDA Nationals where two members also received speaking awards.

==In media==

[[File:Love Equality NI logo.jpg|alt=Love Equality logo|thumb|Love Equality logo]]
'''Love Equality''' is an advocacy organisation composed of six different civic society and LGBT charities to pursue the legalisation of [[same-sex marriage]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. Love Equality primarily operates within Northern Ireland and is led by [[National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland]], [[Amnesty International]], [[Rainbow Project]], [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]], Cara-Friend and Here NI. It is the main campaigning organisation for marriage equality in Northern Ireland.

Love Equality was established in April 2016, eleven months after the passing of the [[Irish marriage equality referendum, 2015]] which led to the [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]].

== History of Love Equality ==
The first pressure group established to campaign for marriage equality in Northern Ireland was called Equal Marriage NI and was composed of a number of voluntary organisations, political activists, charities and volunteers in 2011. Despite growing calls for marriage equality in the rest of the UK and Ireland the campaign was slow to start and by 2012 the organisation was basically defunct.

After the introduction of marriage equality in the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 2015 the six organisations of Rainbow Project, ICTU, NUS-USI, Amnesty International, Cara-Friend and Here NI came together to launch Love Equality in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/04/16/fresh-campaign-for-equal-marriage-in-northern-ireland-launches/|title=Fresh campaign for equal marriage in Northern Ireland launches|work=PinkNews|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''men's rights movement in India''' is composed of various [[men's rights]] organisations in [[India]]. Proponents of the movement support the introduction of [[Gender neutrality|gender-neutral]] legislation and repeal of laws that they consider are biased against men&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, A. (2018). A demand for a National Commission for Men in India: A rationale and its possible consequences. New Male Studies: An International Journal, 7(1): 76-80. http://www.newmalestudies.com/OJS/index.php/nms/article/view/275/338&lt;/ref&gt;.

The movement notes several issues as too genderized or with a bias against men in India. Men's rights activists claim that [[Dowry system in India|anti-dowry laws in India]] are frequently being misused to harass and extort husbands, and attributed this to the high suicide rate among married men in India&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, A. (2018). A demand for a National Commission for Men in India: A rationale and its possible consequences. New Male Studies: An International Journal, 7(1): 76-80. http://www.newmalestudies.com/OJS/index.php/nms/article/view/275/338&lt;/ref&gt;, which is almost twice that of women. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} They claim that the divorce and child custody laws are biased against men. According to them, the frequency of domestic violence against men has increased in recent years, and that many cases go unreported as men feel too ashamed to report abuse, or fear false accusations against them in reprisal. Some men's rights activists also consider rape reporting laws and sexual harassment laws in India to be unfair to men.

==History==

===2000–2005===
The Real Indian men's rights movement was started in 2000 in [Bombay] now Mumbai by Mens Right Activists Rudolph D'souza Popularly known as Rudy to help other fellow victims [[psychological abuse]] perpetrated by wives and false claims of [[Dowry system in India|dowry harassment]] by wives.

===2006–2010===

In September 2008, Save Family Foundation sent a complaint against a Kitply plywood commercial to the [[Advertising Standards Council of India]]. The ad showed a wife slapping her husband on her wedding day because of a creaking bed. The complaint alleged that the ad promoted violence against men by portraying it as funny. In the same month, Chennai-based organisation ''Indiya Kudumba Pathukappu Iyaakam'', complained against a [[Pond's]] ad which portrayed men as wife-beaters and an [[ICICI Bank|ICICI Prudential Insurance]] commercial which allegedly portrayed verbal and economical abuse against men.&lt;ref name="kitply ad"&gt;{{cite news|title=Men's groups want 'offensive' ad off air|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-men-s-groups-want-offensive-ad-off-air-1190494|accessdate=22 April 2014|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Child's Right and Family Welfare" was formed in 2009 to demand fairer laws for men, including better child custody and access laws.&lt;ref name=biwi/&gt; In April 2010, when Pakistani cricketer [[Shoaib Malik]] was accused of cheating by a woman from [[Hyderabad (India)|Hyderabad]], Ayesha Siddiqui, just prior to his marriage to tennis player [[Sania Mirza]], SIFF released a statement in support of Malik and demanding that his passport be returned. It added its concerns over such misuses of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.&lt;ref name=malik1&gt;{{cite news|title=Now a Men's Rights Organisation Supports Shoaib|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=678707|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=[[Outlook India]]|date=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=malik2&gt;{{cite news|title=Shoaib Malik finds support from an NGO|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/shoaib-malik-finds-support-from-an-ngo/600910/|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|date=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the head of the [[Ministry of Women and Child Development]], [[Renuka Chowdhury]], agreed to meet men's rights activists to listen to their allegations of biased legislation. On 25 June 2009, the activists were invited to discuss possible changes to these laws. However, the ministry changed the agenda of the meeting on 24 June, and ministry officials announced they were "unwilling to accept any flaws in current laws." This angered the activists and resulted in a large number of  complaints to the [[Government of India|Indian government]]. A week later, government officials indicated they would indeed review the current laws.&lt;ref name="review forced"&gt;{{cite news|title=Men force review of 'biased' dowry law|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com//1080707/jsp/nation/story_9514141.jsp|accessdate=22 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (India)|The Telegraph]]|date=6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010–2013===

In late 2012, men's rights activists criticised actor [[Aamir Khan]]'s television show, [[Satyamev Jayate (TV series)|Satyamev Jayate]]. In December 2012, about 15,000 men pledged to boycott Khan's film ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within|Talaash]]''. According to Anil Kumar, co-founder of SIFF, Khan had portrayed men negatively on the show and had projected only one side of the domestic violence issue.&lt;ref name=boycott&gt;{{cite news|title=15,000 men to boycott all Aamir's films until he apologises!|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/15000-men-to-boycott-all-Aamirs-films-until-he-apologises/articleshow/17441365.cms|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phanisai Bhardwaj, a [[Lok Satta Party]] candidate in Karnataka assembly polls, was found out to be a member of Centre for Men's Rights, against the Section 498a of IPC and [[Reservation in India|reservation]]s in jobs or education, after he made a post on Facebook in April 2013. He faced a protest campaign against him on the [[blogosphere]], which called the Lok Satta Party "anti-women" and "anti SC/ST". [[Jayaprakash Narayan (Lok Satta)|Jayprakash Narayan]], founder of Lok Satta Party, called Bhardwaj's position on women "unacceptable". Later, Bhardwaj was asked to withdraw his nomination.&lt;ref name="facebook row"&gt;{{cite news|title=Facebook posts trigger row|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/facebook-posts-trigger-row/article4637358.ece|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 August 2013, Hridaya, a Kolkata-based NGO raised concerns about the proposed Marriage Laws (Amendment Bill), 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Marriage%20Laws/Marriage%20Laws%20Bill%202010.pdf|title = THE MARRIAGE LAWS (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2010|date = |accessdate = |website = PRS Legislative Research|publisher = PRS India|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been approved by the cabinet and cleared by Group of Ministers (GoM) headed by defence minister [[A. K. Antony]]. According to Amartya Talukdar, the bill, which introduces the concept of [[no-fault divorce]] and marital property is not fair for men. It will put the institution of marriage in jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestatesman.net/news/11962-protest-against-marriage-bill.html |title=Protest against Marriage Bill |date=26 August 2013 |accessdate= |website=The Statesman |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023064248/http://www.thestatesman.net/news/11962-protest-against-marriage-bill.html |archivedate=23 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2013, members of National Coalition for Men held a demonstration outside the offices of West Bengal Human Rights Commission (WBHRC) in [[Kolkata]], stating that former Supreme Court judge [[Asok Kumar Ganguly]], and then chairman of WBHRC, was innocent until proven guilty. Ganguly had been accused of sexual harassment by a law intern. Amit Gupta, General Secretary of National Coalition for Men, said that even if the legal system of India and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UN Charter on Human Rights]] states that an accused is to be treated as innocent until proven guilty, Ganguly was being held as guilty and subjected to a [[Trial by media|media trial]].&lt;ref name=pro-Ganguly&gt;{{cite news|title=Men's rights group holds pro-Ganguly rally|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mens-rights-group-holds-proganguly-rally/article5488518.ece|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===

On 16 February 2014, the members of Hridaya organised another protest against the [[Marriage Laws Amendment Bill (India)]] that would introduce [[No-fault divorce|no fault divorce]] in the [[Hindu Marriage Act]] by wearing [[sari]]s. Amartya Talukdar voiced concern and said that if the government really intends to empower women, then the law should be made applicable to all communities by bringing [[Uniform civil code of India|uniform civil code]] instead of being applicable only to [[Hindus]].&lt;ref name=wearsarees&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/men-wear-sarees-in-kolkata-to-protest-marital-amendment-bill/1/343851.html|title = Men wear sarees in Kolkata to protest against Marital Amendment Bill|date =16 February 2014|accessdate = 8 January 2014|work=[[India Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, men's rights activists also criticised the second season of Aamir Khan's TV show, [[Satyamev Jayate (TV series)|Satyamev Jayate]]. SIFF said that the Aamir Khan quoted the domestic violence data from the National Family Health Survey, which surveyed only women from 15 to 49 age. They said the show gave the perception that men do not suffer from domestic violence.&lt;ref name=AamirKhanMalign&gt;{{cite news|title=Aamir Khan is maligning Men by telling lies, says Save Indian Family Foundation|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/Aamir-Khan-through-Satyamev-Jayate-is-maligning-Men-by-telling-lies-says-Save-Indian-Family-Foundation/articleshow/32423311.cms?|accessdate=28 March 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian general election, 2014====

During the pre-election campaign period for the [[Indian general election, 2014]], on 11 January 2014, National Coalition for Men in [[Kolkata]] present their demand of the formation of a men's ministry and a men's rights panel to all political parties in India. They also released their own manifesto called "Men-ifesto" which dealt with the issues of men and the need of provisions from the government to address those issues. The other demands raised were gender neutral laws, rehabilitation of men who were acquitted, speedy trials of the accused languishing in custody, and equal rights in child custody. The National Coalition for Men met with political parties across India to urge them to include men's rights in their manifestos.&lt;ref name="now a menifesto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Now, a 'men-ifesto' for male rights|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/now-a-men-ifesto-for-male-rights-114011100678_1.html|accessdate=8 April 2014|date=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amit Gupta said that they may start their own political party if their demands are ignored.&lt;ref name="float party"&gt;{{cite news|title=Men's rights organisation set to float a political party|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-men-s-rights-organisation-set-to-float-a-political-party-1958987|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 March 2014, Amit Gupta urged voters across the country to exercise the "[[None of the above]]" (NOTA) in the [[Indian general election, 2014|2014 general elections]]. According to him, no political party was paying heed to their demands of gender neutral laws and a Ministry of Men's Welfare.&lt;ref name="NOTA"&gt;{{cite news|title=Men's rights group urges citizens to use NOTA|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mens-rights-group-urges-citizens-to-use-nota/article5847139.ece|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early April 2014, Save Indian Family Foundation (SIFF) sent out four queries regarding men's issues to various political leaders. Anil Kumar of SIFF said that they would decide which party to vote for in the 2014 election based on the responses. He added that a survey of SIFF members had indicated a lack of support for the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] party and the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|Communist Party of India]]. The four questions that were posed are whether the party would introduce a bill to protect men against domestic violence, whether biological fathers should be given partial custody in a shared parenting arrangement in divorces, whether consensual sex with the false promise of marriage should be considered rape and if a man should be considered a rapist for breaking up with his girlfriend, and whether the party would introduce men studies courses in universities similar to other gender studies courses.&lt;ref name=4questions&gt;{{cite news|title=Men's rights activists put condition for their vote|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Home/Lok-Sabha-Elections-2014/News/Mens-rights-activists-put-condition-for-their-vote/articleshow/33194416.cms|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2014, men's right groups asked supporters to vote for [[Samajwadi Party]] or use "None of the above" (NOTA). Amit Lakhani, an activist of Save Family Foundation based in New Delhi, expressed support for Samajwadi Party by saying that only that political party had included men's issues in their manifesto.&lt;ref name=Samajwadi&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote for Samajwadi Party or press Nota|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/lok-sabha-elections-2014/news/Vote-for-Samajwadi-Party-or-press-Nota-Mulayam/articleshow/33835972.cms|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015–present===
In August 2015, Amit Deshpande, one of the pioneers in India's Men's Rights Movement, delivered a speech at a TEDx event on the need for Men's Rights and how men are victims of general social discourse of male-hatred, male-mocking or ‘Misandry’. It attempted to highlight the discrimination Indian men face, how patriarchy has been oppressive to them and questioned the stereotypes associated with sexual abuse, domestic violence and other such issues in which women are automatically assumed to be victims and men the assaulter. The talk urged everyone to shift the discussion to a point from where it is possible to see both sides objectively and not perceptively.&lt;ref name="NeedForMen'sRights"&gt;{{cite news|title=Need for Men's Rights|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qoRZhlSep4|accessdate=12 October 2015|work=[[TED (conference)]]|date=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, the Mumbai-based Vaastav Foundation released a calendar called a "Malendar" marking male oriented days such as Father's Day and International Men's Day. Amit Deshpande the founder of Vaastav Foundation said that they were trying to raise awareness towards these days through positive images of men.&lt;ref name=Malendar&gt;{{cite news|title=Mumbai NGO Brings Out Men's Right Calendar 'Malendar'|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/Mumbai-NGO-Brings-Out-Mens-Right-Calendar-Malendar/2015/12/15/article3179018.ece|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=[[The New Indian Express]]|date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2016 [[Mumbai Marathon]], about 150 men from Vaastav Foundation participated while dressed as [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s. Amit Deshpande the founder of Vaastav Foundation said, "A man is forced to be an ATM for his family and if he fails to protect his wife or provide for her, he is immediately accused of mistreating her." One of the most notable placards visible during the event read "Until men learn to express their pain, every story will always portray women as victims." The participation with man dressed as ATM, the first of its kind, received coverage by the media worldwide.&lt;ref name=NovelWay&gt;{{cite news|title='Husband is not an ATM': Men find novel way to demand their rights|url=http://www.firstpost.com/living/husband-is-not-an-atm-men-find-novel-way-to-demand-their-rights-2594840.html|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=[[Firstpost]]|date=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the participation of Vaastav Foundation in Mumbai Marathon was grander with participation in larger numbers and with much bigger prop of a snake which they referred to it as a 'snake of misandry that gobbles up innocent men'. The larger than life size snake had text of misused gender-discriminative criminal laws (namely anti-dowry laws, molestation, rape, section 377 of IPC and maintenance &amp; alimony laws) on one side and the text of most concerning social &amp; criminal issues faced by boys &amp; men (viz. child-labour, boy's education, male suicides, domestic violence on men, male rape and patriarchal burdens of being default protectors &amp; providers) on the other side.

While displaying banners with text "Patriarchy Enslaves Men" and shouting slogans that meant "Would you marry? Would you go to prison?", the activists equated marriage with entrapment. Their participation was widely covered by regional &amp; national print &amp; electronic media.

Until July 2014, the Section 498a of the Indian Penal Code allowed the police to arrest the persons mentioned in the complaint without a warrant or without any investigation.&lt;ref name="forces review"&gt;{{cite news|title=Misuse forces a review of dowry law|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newdelhi/misuse-forces-a-review-of-dowry-law/article1-667632.aspx|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=28 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407101957/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newdelhi/misuse-forces-a-review-of-dowry-law/article1-667632.aspx|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crime was non-bailable, so chances of getting a bail are low and husbands usually lost their jobs while in custody.&lt;ref name="panel amend"/&gt; On 2 July 2014, the [[Supreme Court of India]] in an order stopped automatic arrests under the Section 498a. The Court directed the police to use the Section 41 of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973]], which contains a checklist, to decide whether an arrest is necessary. The Court also stated that in all arrests the magistrate must examine whether further detention was necessary.&lt;ref name=noarrest_SC/&gt; There is also no provision of withdrawing a complaint in case of a reconciliation. However, an amendment to rectify this has been proposed.&lt;ref name="panel amend"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AmendedRoom/&gt;

Of all arrests made the [[Indian Penal Code]], 6% are made under the Section 498a.

According to SIFF, these laws don't follow conventional legal premises where a person is innocent until proven guilty.

He has said that sometimes while visiting India, men are accused under the law and get arrested by police without verifying if the case is genuine and their passports are seized.

====Notable verdicts and legal panel reports====
In November 2003, the Committee on Reforms in the Criminal Justice System (CRCJS), headed by [[V. S. Malimath]], recommended that Section 498a be made bailable and compoundable.&lt;ref name="panel amend"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dowry cases: panel for amending IPC section|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/11/17/stories/2003111703400500.htm|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=17 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RaoCorreya2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anita Rao|author2=Svetlana Sandra Correya|title=Leading Cases on Dowry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DS5OyWb0SogC&amp;pg=PA295|accessdate=6 April 2015|year=2011|publisher=Socio Legal Information Cent|isbn=978-81-89479-73-2|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005, the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] admitted that in many instances complaints under the Section 498a of the Indian Penal Code are not bona fide and have oblique motives. The court added that acquittal in such cases doesn't erase the suffering the defendant has to go through, which is compounded by adverse media coverage. The court also directed the legislature to find ways to check such false cases.&lt;ref name="shield not weapon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dowry law is a shield, not an assassin's weapon: court|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/07/22/stories/2005072202631500.htm|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=22 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] directed the government to amend Section 498a of the Indian Penal Code in view of the rising numbers of false or exaggerated complaints against husbands and their relatives by women. It further added that such complaints result in the husband and his relatives remaining in custody until trial or bail, which kills all chances of an amicable settlement.&lt;ref name="amend dowry"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amend dowry law to stop its misuse, SC tells govt|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Amend-dowry-law-to-stop-its-misuse-SC-tells-govt/articleshow/6321987.cms?referral=PM|accessdate=6 April 2014|date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the [[Law Commission of India]] recommended that Section 498a should be made a compoundable offense. But, the court will decide if the particular case is compoundable or not.&lt;ref name="toned down"&gt;{{cite news|title=Law Commission wants dowry law toned down|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Law-Commission-wants-dowry-law-toned-down/articleshow/11572411.cms|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2014, the Supreme Court said that this law is being used by some women to harass their husband and in-laws. The court prohibited the police from making arrests on the mere basis of a complaint. The court asked the police to follow Section 41 of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973]], which provides a 9-point checklist which must be used to decide the need for an arrest. The court also said that a magistrate must decide whether an arrested accused is needed to be kept under further detention.&lt;ref name=noarrest_SC&gt;{{cite news|title=No arrests under anti-dowry law without magistrate's nod: SC|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/No-arrests-under-anti-dowry-law-without-magistrates-nod-SC/articleshow/37661519.cms|accessdate=23 July 2014|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arnesh vs bihar"/&gt; The decision was in response to a Special Leave Petition (SPL) filed by one Arnesh Kumar challenging his arrest and of his family under this law.&lt;ref name="arnesh vs bihar"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Arnesh Kumar v.

====Proposed amendments====

In 2014, the [[National Commission for Women]] proposed some changes to the law which included widening the definition of the term ''dowry'' and increasing the penalty for false cases. But, the suggestions were rejected by the [[Ministry of Women and Child Development (India)|Ministry of Women and Child Development]]. The Minister for Women, [[Maneka Gandhi]], told the [[Lok Sabha]] in December, "The NCW had recommended certain amendments in Dowry Prohibition Act. However, the ministry has taken a considered view on the matter and decided to drop the amendment proposed by NCW in the present form after taking into account the comments of the high level committee on the status of women and the ministry of home affairs". Ranjana Kumari of [[Centre for Social Research]] welcomed this decision to not dilute the law.&lt;ref name=DropsPlan&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt drops plan to amend Dowry Act|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Govt-drops-plan-to-amend-Dowry-Act/articleshow/45499992.cms|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, it was reported that Government of India was planning to amend Section 498A. It would be made compoundable, which would allow the parties to settle if the court recommended it. The fine for filing a false case would be increased from {{currency|1000|INR}} to {{currency|15000|INR}}.&lt;ref name=10percentFalse&gt;{{cite news|title=10% of dowry cases false, government plans changes in law|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-of-dowry-cases-false-government-plans-changes-in-law/articleshow/46649047.cms|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amit Gupta, of National Coalition for Men, has opposed making the law compoundable. He has said that it would make extortion easier. He has pointed out that after [[Andhra Pradesh]] made it compoundable, the number of case rose by 150% and conviction rate fell by 400%.&lt;ref name=ForumOpposes&gt;{{cite news|title=Men's forum opposes anti-dowry law|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/Mens-forum-opposes-anti-dowry-law/articleshow/46793492.cms|accessdate=12 April 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maneka Gandhi]], the Minister for Women &amp; Child Development, has also opposed any changes to the existing dowry laws.&lt;ref name=Maneka&gt;{{cite news|title=Maneka against dilution of anti-dowry law|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Maneka-against-dilution-of-anti-dowry-law/articleshow/46657002.cms|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranjana Kumari of the [[Centre for Social Research]] has also expressed disagreement over demands to amend the anti-dowry law, pointing out that [[dowry death]]s are still occurring in India.&lt;ref name=NRIsShun/&gt;

===Divorce and child custody laws===
The men's rights activists in India claim that the divorce and child custody laws are biased against men.&lt;ref name="push shared"/&gt; They say that this allows divorced wives to stop men from seeing their children for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=TimeWithKids&gt;{{cite news|title=Divorce dads fight for time with kids|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140622/nation-current-affairs/article/divorcee-fathers-fight-time-kids|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=[[Deccan Chronicle]]|date=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have said that alimony should not be granted if the wife is the primary earner of the family and the law should see men capable of bringing up children.&lt;ref name=2009Launched&gt;{{cite news|title=Movement protecting men’s rights launched|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/movement-protecting-mens-rights-launched/article176190.ece|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, child custody is granted to the father only if the mother is mentally unstable or has left home leaving behind the child.&lt;ref name="push shared"&gt;{{cite news|title=Push for shared parenting – Activists for law to make joint custody must in broken homes|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140818/jsp/nation/story_18731035.jsp|accessdate=29 August 2014|work=[[The Telegraph (India)|The Telegraph]]|date=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the matter custody in case of divorce is governed by two laws: Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 and Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. But, both laws do not have any provisions for [[shared parenting]] or [[joint custody]].&lt;ref name=opt-shared/&gt;

Under the Evidence Act, 1872, if a child is born within a marriage or within 280 days of dissolution of a marriage, then the child is considered [[legitimate child|legitimate]] and is entitled to [[child support]] and inheritance.&lt;ref name="Barooah1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pramila Pandit Barooah|title=Handbook on Child, with Historical Background|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7aMQM4QJ7VQC&amp;pg=PA64|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-735-9|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, [[DNA paternity testing|DNA paternity tests]] do not take precedence over this law.

An organisation named Children's Rights Initiative for Shared Parenting (CRISP) has demanded better child access laws and has called the current custodial laws gender-biased.&lt;ref name="better access"&gt;{{cite news|title=Estranged fathers demand better access to their children|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/estranged-fathers-demand-better-access-to-their-children/article2119375.ece|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has demanded amendments to the Guardians and Wards Act be amended to make [[shared parenting]] mandatory.&lt;ref name="push shared"/&gt;

Swarup Sarkar of Save Family Foundation has speculated that now two out of three Indian couples actively share parenting. Kumar Jahagirdar, president of CRISP, has noted a growth in men who are the primary caregivers in the family.&lt;ref name="MBA in fatherhood"&gt;{{cite news|title=In search of an MBA in Fatherhood|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/parenting/In-search-of-an-MBA-in-Fatherhood/articleshow/13559756.cms|accessdate=22 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notable verdicts====
In April 2003, the [[Supreme Court of India]] granted a woman divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty. She had claimed that her husband was harassing her and accusing her of affairs. Although four or five out of ten divorce cases in India allege mental agony, Ram Prakash Chugh said that if a man brought similar charges to a court, he will be unlikely to get a favourable ruling.&lt;ref name="nagging husband"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wife gets divorce from nagging husband|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=30 April 2003|accessdate=6 April 2014|location=[[Delhi]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2988617.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the [[Delhi High Court]] in a verdict said that a woman earning sufficient income is not entitled to maintenance from her divorced husband. The verdict came after a man challenged a family court's decision to grant {{currency|7,500|INR}} monthly alimony to his wife. The man had pointed out that his wife was earning {{currency|80,000|INR}} for month and had no other responsibilities.&lt;ref name=noalimony&gt;{{cite news|title='No alimony for wife earning well'|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-no-alimony-for-wife-earning-well-1192215|accessdate=1 December 2014|work=[[DNA India]]|date=22 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the Delhi High Court released a verdict that a man cannot be forced to pay alimony if he is unemployed. The man had challenged a lower court's order that he should pay {{currency|5,000|INR}} as alimony. The man pointed out that he was an expatiate working as a sales manager in [[Angola]] and had come to India to marry. He got married in May 2007 but the marriage lasted only three weeks. Due to his wife's complaint, the police seized his passport and he was unable to return to job, which resulted in his termination. The court stated that wife was equally qualified to her husband, and was working in a [[multi-national company]], thus she cannot claim alimony.&lt;ref name=ForcedAlimony&gt;{{cite news|title=Unemployed man can't be forced to pay alimony: HC|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/unemployed-man-cant-be-forced-to-pay-alimony-hc/673385/0|accessdate=1 December 2014|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the Delhi High Court said that a man's assets should be examined while deciding the alimony sum. The court was deciding a case where man initially asked to pay {{currency|15,000|INR}} in total as alimony per month by a lower. After an appeal from his wife, he was asked to pay {{currency|45,000|INR}} by another court which took into consideration his net assets. The man had challenged this decision by pointing out his monthly salary was {{currency|41,000|INR}}. The court reduced the alimony sum to {{currency|20,000|INR}} per and stated that a man's parents and sibling also have a stake in his assets.&lt;ref name=assetalimony&gt;{{cite news|title=Man's assets not to be considered for alimony, rules High Court|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/mans-assets-not-to-be-considered-for-alimony-rules-high-court/article613598.ece|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, [[Supreme Court of India]] passed a judgment according to which long-term live-in relationships will be considered as marriage. The female spouse then can claim [[alimony]] under the [[Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005|Domestic Violence Act 2005]] which uses the phrase "relationship in the nature of marriage". The court was adjudicating a case where a man, who was already married, was being sue by another woman.&lt;ref name=live-in&gt;{{cite news|title=What makes a live-in 'legal'?

In June 2012, Delhi High Court said that a woman who is educated and capable of maintaining herself, but has quit her job voluntarily is not entitle to alimony. The verdict was given in case where a woman challenged a lower court's decision to not grant her any alimony. The High Court pointed out that the woman was capable of earning {{currency|50,000|INR}} per month but was choosing to remain unemployed, and denied any alimony to her. However, the court ordered the husband to pay {{currency|10,000|INR}} towards child support.&lt;ref name=Wiffully&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman Quitting Job Wilfully Not Entitled to Alimony: HC|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/news/article/Woman-Quitting-Job-Wilfully-Not-Entitled-to-Alimony-HC/764403|accessdate=1 December 2014|work=[[Outlook India]]|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2013, the [[Karnataka High Court]] granted equal custody of a 12-year-old boy to both parents. The court ordered that the boy to remain with his mother from 1 July to 31 December of every year and to remain with his father from 1 January to 30 June, until the child reaches the age of majority. Both the parents were also given visitations rights on Saturday and Sunday, when the child would be with the other parent. The child was also allowed to call or video chat with the other parent when in custody of one. The court also ordered both parents to bear the child's education and other expenses equally.&lt;ref name="HC joint"&gt;{{cite news|title=In a first, HC orders joint custody of child|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/bangalore/others/In-a-first-HC-orders-joint-custody-of-child/articleshow/22603857.cms|accessdate=29 August 2014|work=[[Bangalore Mirror]]|date=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="six months"&gt;{{cite news|title=Child custody case: Six months with father, six months with mother, Karnataka HC says|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/Child-custody-case-Six-months-with-father-six-months-with-mother-Karnataka-HC-says/articleshow/23171108.cms|accessdate=29 August 2014|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proposed laws====

=====Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2010=====
{{see also|Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2010}}

In 2010, a proposed [[Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2010|amendment]] to the [[Hindu Marriage Act]] would allow courts to decide compensation to wife and children from the husband's inherited and inheritable property. The bill has provision for "irretrievable breakdown" of marriage where both parties must have lived apart for three years before filing for divorce. The bill would also allow the wife to oppose the dissolution of a marriage if it would leave her in financial hardship.&lt;ref name="Rayja women friendly"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rajya Sabha approves bill to make divorce friendly for women|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/rajya-sabha-approves-bill-to-make-divorce-friendly-for-women/1160381/0|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|date=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIFF protested against the 2010 amendment. According to Rajesh Vakharia, president of SIFF, this bill would encourage divorce and be costly to husbands, as they would have to part with their assets.&lt;ref name="marriage amendment"&gt;{{cite news|title=Men's rights groups to protest Marriage Amendment Bill|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mens-rights-groups-to-protest-marriage-amendment-bill/article3707569.ece|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the bill a regressive move, and stated that it jeopardizes the financial and social security of a man.&lt;ref name="hope of share"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hope of share in inherited assets for wife|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130718/jsp/nation/story_17130002.jsp|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (India)|The Telegraph]]|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has pointed out that as most men marry after becoming financially secure, the possibility of losing their wealth and property would discourage men from marriage and feed the [[gynophobia]] in the society.&lt;ref name="men's right amendment"&gt;{{cite news|title=Men's rights activists oppose amendment to marriage law|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/Mens-rights-activists-oppose-amendment-to-marriage-law/articleshow/21703825.cms|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumar V. Jahgirdar, founder and president of the Bangalore-based Children's Rights Initiative for Shared Parenting (CRISP), said that alimony should be decided on the basis of how many years the couple were married, and argued that the law doesn't allow a husband to refute his wife's claims. He also argued that it is based on a flawed assumption that the children are always best cared for by their mother, and that it violates [[Fundamental rights in India#Right to equality|Article 14 of the Indian Constitution]], right to equality. Swarup Sarkar, founder and member of Save Family Foundation, said that the suggestions offered by them to the Law Minister and the parliamentary committee were ignored.&lt;ref name="seeking equality"&gt;{{cite news|title=Seeking 'equality' with women, men protest marriage law bill|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/272645/seeking-equality-women-men-protest.html|accessdate=22 April 2014|newspaper=[[Deccan Herald]]|date=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sore&gt;{{cite news|title=Men's rights groups sore at marriage laws bill|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himachalpradesh/men-s-rights-groups-sore-at-marriage-laws-bill/article1-1184548.aspx|accessdate=28 June 2014|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Derek O'Brien (quizmaster)|Derek O'Brien]], member of the [[All India Trinamool Congress]] political party, argued that this law empowers women at the expense of men. He proposed that this law should be made gender neutral by using the word "spouse" instead of "wife" or "husband". [[Arvind Kumar Singh]] of [[Samajwadi Party]] said that the law has potential for misuse like the anti-dowry laws and added that it treats men as being responsible for divorces. [[Vandana Chavan]] of [[Nationalist Congress Party]] has pointed out that the bill was unfair as nowadays, many women earn equal to or more than their husbands.&lt;ref name="bill weathers"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill weathers 'anti-men' cry|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130827/jsp/nation/story_17277726.jsp|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (India)|The Telegraph]]|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Amartya Talukdar raised concern that the bill amends marriage laws for Hindus only, who made up 79 percent of India's population in 2011. Talukdar stated, "If the Government really wants to bring about empowerment of women, let them make it open for all sections of the society. Let them bring a [[uniform civil code]]. Why is it only for the Hindus?"&lt;ref name=TodaySaree&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/men-wear-sarees-in-kolkata-to-protest-marital-amendment-bill/1/343851.html|title = Men wear sarees in Kolkata to protest against Marital Amendment Bill|last = |first = |date = 16 Feb 2014|work = India Today|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=States&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestatesman.net/news/11962-protest-against-marriage-bill.html |title=Protest against Marriage Bill |last= |first= |date=26 Aug 2013 |work=[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]] |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023064248/http://www.thestatesman.net/news/11962-protest-against-marriage-bill.html |archivedate=23 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RajyaApproves&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/rajya-sabha-approves-bill-to-make-divorce-friendly-for-women/|title=Rajya Sabha approves bill to make divorce friendly for women|date=26 August 2013|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Consultation Paper on Shared Parentage=====
In November 2014, the [[Law Commission of India]] started a study and released a consultation paper on its website seeking views from the public on proposed guidelines for joint custody and shared parenting. The commission expects to complete the study by January 2015 and present the findings to the government for amendments to the law by the 2015 budget session of the Parliament.&lt;ref name=opt-shared&gt;{{cite news|title=India may opt for shared child custody|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-may-opt-for-shared-child-custody/articleshow/45103597.cms|accessdate=1 December 2014|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flavia Agnes]], an attorney and women's rights activist, opposed the shared parenthood law consultation paper floated by the [[Law Commission of India]] by claiming that it was being lobbied by men's rights organisations and that it would erode women and children's rights.&lt;ref name=Flavia&gt;{{cite news|title=Shared disadvantage: about shared parentage system in India|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/141127/commentary-op-ed/article/shared-disadvantage-about-shared-parentage-system-india|accessdate=1 December 2014|work=[[Deccan Chronicle]]|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence===
According to men's rights activists, the incidence of domestic violence against men in recent years has increased. The activists say that many cases go unreported as men feel too ashamed to report abuse, or fear false accusations against them in reprisal.&lt;ref name=WhenHusband2014&gt;{{cite news|title=When husbands are victims of domestic violence|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/man-woman/When-husbands-are-victims-of-domestic-violence/articleshow/26031858.cms|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two groups, the Save Indian Family Foundation (SIFF) and the Indian Social Awareness and Activism Forum (INSAAF), have demanded inclusion of men's issues in the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted by the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] to allow a better picture of the situation to emerge.&lt;ref name=nfhs&gt;{{cite news|title=Demand to include men's issues in family health survey|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/Demand-to-include-mens-issues-in-family-health-survey/articleshow/35489569.cms|accessdate=8 June 2014|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=23 May 2014|ref=health_survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ram Prakash Chugh has stated that many cases of domestic violence against men go unreported due to the male ego.&lt;ref name="nagging wife"/&gt; Swarup Sarkar, founder of SIFF, has said that there is no legal provision for married men facing verbal or mental abuse.&lt;ref name=onelakhsuicide/&gt; Indian Social Awareness and Activism Forum (INSAAF), and Confidare Research have drafted a bill which aims to protect men and boys from domestic violence from their spouse, girlfriends and parents.

The [[Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005]] identifies domestic violence as abuse or threat of abuse, whether physical, sexual, verbal, emotional or economic. It provides protection to wives and female live-in partners from domestic violence carried out by husbands, male live-in partners or their relatives.&lt;ref name="women too"&gt;{{cite news|title=Domestic Violence Act can be used against women too: HC|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-domestic-violence-act-can-be-used-against-women-too-hc-1829536|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swarup Sarkar of Save Indian Family has argued that Domestic Violence Act should be made gender neutral.&lt;ref name="new victims"&gt;{{cite news|title=Men new 'victims' of domestic violence|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news-feed/nm19/men-new-victims-of-domestic-violence/article1-169073.aspx|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=4 November 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407100621/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news-feed/nm19/men-new-victims-of-domestic-violence/article1-169073.aspx|archivedate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also termed the law as [[Vexatious litigation|legal terrorism]].&lt;ref name=terrorist/&gt;

[[Indira Jaising]] has argued that men don't need to be covered under the domestic violence act as they have several other rights to appeal with, but women need special rights to defend their lives in a male-dominated society.&lt;ref name=rights_too&gt;{{cite news|title=Men have rights too!

The [[Jabalpur]], Amarkantak and Hoshangabad region of [[Madhya Pradesh]] reports a large number of [[sadhus]] who have left their marriages to become holy men or yoghis. According to family counseling centres in Jabalpur, the share of harassed husbands was 70 percent among complainants as per data recorded between 2013 and 2014. About 4,500 husbands are missing from family court records in the region.

Mithun Kumar, a researcher at SIFF, has said that police don't take any action even if the suicide note of a man states that he was tortured by his wife and in-laws, but in case of a woman's suicide her husband's family is taken into custody without investigation.&lt;ref name=helpline&gt;{{cite news|title=Helpline to address problems of 'distressed' men|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/helpline-to-address-problems-of-distressed-men/article93190.ece|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 2012 report published by the [[Million Death Study]] researchers, it was stated that since attempting suicide in India was a crime until 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jain|first1=Bharti|title=Government decriminalizes attempt to commit suicide, removes section 309|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Government-decriminalizes-attempt-to-commit-suicide-removes-section-309/articleshow/45452253.cms|accessdate=28 August 2015|work=[[Times of India]]|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; suicides are under-reported, especially suicides of young married women.

==Khasi tribe==
The [[Khasi people|Khasi tribe]] in Meghalaya state is [[Matrilineality|matrilinear]]. The children take the mother's surname, the sons have no rights to property, and a family without an heir usually adopts a girl. After marriage, a man moves into his wife's house. Their way of life is protected under the Khasi Social Custom of Lineage Act of 1997. In 1990, the men in this tribe started a men's liberation movement called ''Syngkhong Rympei Thymmai'' (Home Hearth Restructured). A previous movement started in the early 1960s died out due to lack of support. The current movement claims to have 2,000 members. According to them, due to a lack of responsibility or sense of purpose, boys are dropping out of schools, men are resorting to drugs and alcohol and dying before reaching middle age.&lt;ref name="son east"&gt;{{cite news|title=Son rises in the east|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110410/jsp/7days/story_13833806.jsp|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (India)|The Telegraph]]|date=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="woman's world"&gt;{{cite news|title=It's a woman's world|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/its-a-womans-world/article4486326.ece|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement seeks, among other things, to have children take their fathers' names and to end the system of property inheritance that favours female offspring.&lt;ref name="woman's world"/&gt;

The '''Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China''' ('''MPS''') is the principal police and security authority of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and the [[Ministries of the People's Republic of China|government ministry]] that exercises oversight over and is ultimately responsible for day-to-day law enforcement. It currently has 1.9 million officers. It is headed by the [[Minister of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Minister of Public Security]]. Prior to 1954, it was known as the '''Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government'''. The Ministry operates the system of [[Public Security Bureau]]s, which are broadly the equivalent of police forces or police stations in other countries. The candidate for the minister of the MPS is nominated by the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]] and approved by the [[National People's Congress]].

As the main domestic security agency in the [[China|People's Republic of China]], the MPS is the equivalent of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] in [[Japan]] or national [[police]] in other countries.  Since the creation of the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] in 1983, the MPS  does not undertake [[riot control]] functions, which are now under  the  control of [[People's Armed Police]], nor does it generally conduct domestic intelligence which since 1983 has been a primary responsibility of the [[Ministry of State Security (China)|Ministry of State Security]]. [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] have their own security bureaus/agencies and police forces. {{As of|November 2017}}, the Minister of Public Security is [[Zhao Kezhi]].

== History ==
The Ministry of Public Security was among the very first government organs of the PRC. It superseded the Ministry of Public Security of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Military Commission, a transitional body created in July 1949 by removing the security service remit from the CCP [[Central Department of Social Affairs]] (CDSA). The ministry began operations on 1 November 1949, at the end of a two-week-long National Conference of Senior Public Security Cadres. Most of its initial staff of less than 500 cadres came from the (former) regional CCP North China Department of Social Affairs. At the national level, its creation signaled the formal abolition of the CDSA. The ministry moved to its present location, in the heart of the one-time foreign legation quarters in Beijing, in the spring of 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Zhongfang, "Gonganbu shi zemyang chenglide," in Zhu Chunlin (ed.) ''Lishi shunjian'' (Beijing: Qunzhong chubanshe, 1999), Vol. 1, pp. 3-16&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
[[File:中华人民共和国警车.jpg|thumb|A police car on Tiananmen Square.]]
[[File:Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the Ministry of Public Security in Beijing]]

The MPS is organized into functional departments (see below). Subordinate to the MPS are the provincial- and municipal-level PSB and sub-bureaus at the county and urban district levels. At the grassroots level, finally, there are police stations (''paichusuo'') which serve as the direct point of contact between police and ordinary citizens. While public security considerations have weighed heavily at all levels of administration since the founding of the PRC, the police are perceived by some outside observers to wield progressively greater influence at lower levels of government.

The organization of local public security stations may be inferred from the tasks with which the police are charged. Generally, each police station has sections assigned to cover census and household registration matters, pretrial investigations, welfare, traffic control, and other activities. Each also has a detention center.

=== Departmental structure ===
At the time of its creation, the Ministry of Public Security had a simple departmental structure comprising one general office and six functional directorates, numbered sequentially and responsible for political security, economic security, public order and administration, border security, armed security, and personnel. Today’s ministry is organized into the following departments: 
* Central Office, 
* Supervision, 
* Personnel &amp; Training, 
* Public Relations, 
* Economic Crime Investigation, 
* Public Order Administration, 
* Border Control, 
* Criminal Investigation, 
* Exit &amp; Entry Administration, 
* Fire Control, 
* Security Protection, 
* Public Information Network Security Supervision, 
* Penitentiary Administration, 
* Traffic Control, 
* Legal Affairs, 
* International Cooperation, 
* Equipment and Finance, 
* Drug Control, 
* Science &amp; Technology, 
* Counter-terrorism, and 
* Info-communications.

Railway, navigation, civil aviation, forestry and anti-smuggling public security departments are under the dual leadership of their superior administration and the MPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mps.gov.cn/English/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208010431/http://www.mps.gov.cn/english/index.htm |archivedate=2012-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities and operations ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In the 1980s the public security station&amp;mdash;the police element in closest contact with the people&amp;mdash;was supervised by the public security subbureau as well as by local governments and procuratorates. The procuratorate could assume direct responsibility for any case that it chose, and it supervised investigations in those cases in which the public security station was allowed to conduct investigations. A great deal of coordination occurred among the public security organs, the procuratorates, and the courts, so that a trial was unlikely to produce a surprise outcome.

The public security station generally had considerably broader responsibilities than a police station in the West, involving itself in every aspect of the district people's lives. In a rural area a station typically has a chief, a deputy chief, a small administrative staff, and a small police force. In an urban area it usually has a greater number of administrative staff members and seven to eighteen patrolmen. Its criminal law activities included investigation, apprehension, interrogation, and temporary detention. The station's household section maintained a registry of all persons living in the area. Births, deaths, marriages, and divorces were recorded and confirmed through random household checks. The station regulated all hotels and required visitors who remained beyond a certain number of days to register. All theaters, cinemas, radio equipment, and printing presses also were registered with the local public security station, permitting it to regulate gatherings and censor information effectively. It also regulated the possession, transportation, and use of all explosives, guns, ammunition, and poisons.

Another important police function was controlling change of residence. Without such controls, large numbers of rural residents undoubtedly would move to the overcrowded cities in search of better living standards, work, or education. In April 1984 the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] issued the [[Tentative Regulations Governing People's Republic of China Resident Identity]], this became the identification card of the People's Republic of China. The regulations, implemented over a period of years, required all residents over sixteen years of age, except active-duty members of the [[People's Liberation Army]] and the [[People's Armed Police]] and inmates serving [[prison]] sentences, to be issued [[resident identity card]]s by the MPS. The identification card indicates the name, sex, nationality, ethnicity, date of birth, and address of the bearer. Cards for persons sixteen to twenty-five years of age were valid for ten years; those for persons between twenty-five and forty-five were valid for twenty years; and persons over forty-five were issued permanent cards. As of early 1987, only 70 million people had been issued identity cards, well below the national goal. Also, even those with resident identity cards preferred to use other forms of identification.

== Criminal procedure powers ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}

Public security officials also made extensive use of their authority to impose administrative sanctions through two sets of documents. These were the 1957 Regulations on [[re-education through labor]], which were reissued in 1979 with amendments (abolished 2015), and the 1957 [[Regulations Governing Offenses Against Public Order]], which were rescinded and replaced in 1986 by regulations of the same name. Offenders under the Regulations on Reeducation Through Labor might include "[[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]], people who have no proper occupation, and people who repeatedly breach public order." The police could apprehend such individuals and sentence them to reeducation through labor with the approval of local labor-training administration committees. The 1957 regulations placed no limit on the length of sentences, but beginning in the early 1960s sentences of three or four years were the norm. The 1979 amended Regulations, however, limited the length of reeducation through labor to three years with the possibility of extensions in extraordinary cases. The Regulations Governing Offenses Against Public Order empowered the police to admonish, fine, or detain people for up to fifteen days. Goods illegally in the possession of an offender were to be confiscated, and payment was imposed for damages or hospital fees in the event that injury had been caused.

The criminal laws in force after January 1, 1980, restricted police powers regarding arrests, investigations, and searches. A public security official or a citizen could apprehend a suspect under emergency conditions, but a court or procuratorate was required to approve the arrest. The accused had to be questioned within twenty-four hours and his or her family or work unit notified of the detention "except in circumstances where notification would hinder the investigation or there was no way to notify them." Any premeditated arrest required a warrant from a court or procuratorate. The time that an accused could be held pending investigation was limited to three to seven days, and incarceration without due process was made illegal.

Two officials were needed to conduct a criminal investigation. They were required to show identification and, apparently, to inform the accused of the crime allegedly committed before he or she was questioned. The suspect could refuse to answer only those questions irrelevant to the case. Torture was rendered illegal.

The 1980 laws also provided that in conjunction with an arrest the police could conduct an emergency search; otherwise, a warrant was required. They had the right to search the person, property, and residence of an accused and the person of any injured party. They could intercept mail belonging to the accused and order an autopsy whenever cause of death was unclear.

In July 1980 the government approved new regulations governing police use of weapons and force. Police personnel could use their batons only in self-defense or when necessary to subdue or prevent the escape of violent criminals or rioters. Lethal weapons, such as [[pistols]], could be used if necessary to stop violent riots, to lessen the overall loss of life, or to subdue surrounded but still resisting criminals. The regulations even governed use of sirens, police lights, and whistles.

== Public relations ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}

The relationship between the police officers assigned to neighborhood patrols and the people was close. Police officers lived in a neighborhood on a long-term assignment and were expected to know all the residents on a personal basis. Their task was not only to prevent and punish crime but to promote desirable behavior by counseling and acting as role models. These socially responsible aspects of the police officer's duties were constant responsibilities, and the bond between the public security units and the people was strengthened annually by means of "cherish-the-people" months, during which the police officer made a special effort to help the local people, especially the aged and infirm.

== Recruitment ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}

Police are officially drawn from every segment of the population without restriction as to sex or ethnic origin. Selection is based on political loyalty, intelligence, and health, as it is for the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]]. There is at least one police school in every provincial-level unit, and others are operated by municipalities. Usually those police designated for leadership positions attend the police schools, and patrolmen are trained at the unit and on the job. Legal training is emphasized as a method of improving the quality of the police forces. In 1985 three institutions of higher learning for police personnel were established&amp;mdash;the [[Chinese People's Public Security University]], the [[University of Police Officers]], and the [[Institute of Criminal Police]]&amp;mdash;offering more than twenty special courses. Students are recruited from the pool of senior middle-school graduates under twenty-two years of age, with a waiver to twenty-five years of age for those who have a minimum of two years' experience in public security work.

== Firearms ==
Local [[municipal police]] under the MPS formally were usually unarmed with firearms routinely in contrast to the soldiers of the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP), however they are armed with [[expandable baton]]s and [[incapacitant spray]]s. Sometimes, [[multitool|multiple use tactical knives]] are issued to the policemen.

A decision has been taken to train in the use of sidearms to all frontline MPS personnel since 2006. The [[9×19mm]] [[Trigger (firearms)|double-action]] [[revolver]] manufactured by the [[Norinco|China North Industries Corporation]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://world.guns.ru/handguns/hg199-e.htm |title=9mm Chinese Police revolver |access-date=2008-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406130126/http://www.world.guns.ru/handguns/hg199-e.htm |archive-date=2008-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are issued to frontline personnel, and officers armed them routinely

For more firepower, [[detective]]s and special units are routinely armed with [[Type 77 pistol|Type 77]] and [[QSZ-92]] [[semi-automatic pistol]]s. [[Sub-machine gun]]s, [[rifle]]s and [[light machine gun]]s are deployed when more firepower are required.

[[Image:Nam Tien.PNG|220px|right|thumb|Map of Vietnam showing the conquest of the south (''nam tiến'', 1069-1834).]]
'''Nam tiến''' ({{IPA-vi|nam tǐən|lang}}, lit. "southward advance" or "march to the south") refers to the southward expansion of the territory of [[Vietnam]] from the 11th century to the mid-18th century.  The territory of Vietnam was gradually expanded to the South from its original heartland in the [[Red River Delta]]. In a span of some 700 years, Vietnam tripled its territory in size and more-or-less acquired its elongated shape of today.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen The Anh, ''Le Nam tien dans les textes Vietnamiens'', in P.B. Lafont; Les frontieres du Vietnam; Edition l’Harmattan, Paris 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The direction of expansion to the south could be explained by geographic and demographic factors. With the [[South China Sea]] to the east, the [[Truong Son Mountains]] to the west, and China to the north, the Vietnamese polity pushed south, following the coastal plains. The 11-14th centuries saw battle gains and losses as the frontier territory changed hands between the Vietnamese and [[Chams]]. The 15-17th centuries following the failed Ming conquest (1407-1420), the resurgent Vietnamese took the upper hand, defeating the less-centralized state of [[Champa]], forcing the cession of more land. By the 17-19th centuries, Vietnamese settlers had penetrated the [[Mekong Delta]]. The [[Nguyen Lords]] of [[ Huế|Hue]] by diplomacy and force wrested the southernmost territory from [[Cambodia]], completing the "March to the South". 

==History==
The native inhabitants of the Central Highlands are the Degar ([[Montagnard People]]) peoples. Vietnam conquered and annexed the area during its "march to the south" (Nam tiến).

Cambodia was constantly invaded by the Vietnamese Nguyen Lords. Around a thousand Vietnamese settlers were slaughtered in 1667 in Cambodia by a combined force of Chinese and Cambodians. Vietnamese settlers started to inhabit Mekong Delta that was previously inhabited by the Khmer and in response the Vietnamese were subjected to Cambodian retaliation.&lt;ref name="Kiernan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Kiernan|title=Blood and Soil: Modern Genocide 1500-2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5p7cRyK748C&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=Melbourne Univ.

Vietnamese Emperor Minh Mang enacted the final conquest of the [[Champa]] Kingdom after the [[History of the Cham–Vietnamese wars|centuries long Cham–Vietnamese wars]]. The [[Chams|Cham]] Muslim leader Katip Suma was educated in [[Kelantan]] and came back to [[Champa]] to declare a [[Jihad]] against the Vietnamese after Emperor Minh Mang's annexation of Champa.&lt;ref name="Hubert2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean-François Hubert|title=The Art of Champa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3oMqrqSp1W4C&amp;pg=PA25|date=8 May 2012|publisher=Parkstone International|isbn=978-1-78042-964-9|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Raja Praong Ritual: A Memory of the Sea in Cham- Malay Relations |url=http://chamunesco.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=110:the-raja-praong-ritual-a-memory-of-the-sea-in-cham-malay-relations&amp;catid=45:van-hoa&amp;Itemid=120 |website=Cham Unesco |accessdate=25 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206042152/http://chamunesco.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=110:the-raja-praong-ritual-a-memory-of-the-sea-in-cham-malay-relations&amp;catid=45:van-hoa&amp;Itemid=120 |archivedate=6 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; (Extracted from Truong Van Mon, “The Raja Praong Ritual: a Memory of the sea in Cham- Malay Relations”, in Memory And Knowledge Of The Sea In South Asia, Institute of Ocean and Earth Sciences, University of Malaya, Monograph Series 3, pp, 97-111.

Extreme anti-Vietnamese sentiment due to Vietnam's conquest of previously Cambodian lands which are now the Mekong delta part of modern day  Vietnam and hundreds of years of Vietnamese invasions, Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia and Vietnam's military subjugation of Cambodia, has led to extreme anti-Vietnamese feelings against ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia and against Vietnam, and in turn has led to pro-China sentiment among the Cambodian government and the Cambodian opposition, including in the South China Sea, leaving Americans unaware of this to be puzzled by pro-China leanings in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greer |first=Tanner |date=January 5, 2017 |title=Cambodia Wants China as Its Neighborhood Bully |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/05/cambodia-wants-china-as-its-neighborhood-bully/ |newspaper=Foreign Policy |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Front''' (''Fronte Nazionale'', '''FN''') was a [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] [[list of political parties in Italy|political party in Italy]].

It was founded in 1990 by [[Franco Freda]] and adopted a policy against 'racial mixing' and immigration, whilst also opposing [[Zionism]], what it called 'cosmo-politics', and the influence of the [[United States]] and international finance.&lt;ref name="AXT"/&gt; The group published an economic journal ''L'antibancor'',&lt;ref name="AXT"/&gt; as well as ''Rubric'', a members' bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;''Antisemitism World Report 1994'', Institute of Jewish Affairs, 1994, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; It became moribund after the 1995 conviction of Freda and 49 other members of the party under the [[Mario Scelba|Scelba]] Law which banned the refoundation of the [[National Fascist Party]].&lt;ref name="AXT"&gt;[http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/countries/italy/italy.htm Italy December 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713051015/http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/countries/italy/italy.htm |date=2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.G.Freda , ''I lupi azzurri.

The '''New Korean Orthography''' was a [[spelling reform]] used in [[North Korea]] from 1948 to 1954. It added five consonants and one vowel letter to the [[hangul]] alphabet, making it what is believed {{by whom|date=October 2017}} to be a more [[morphophonology|morphophonologically]] "clear" approach to the [[Korean language]].

==History==
After the establishment of the [[North Korea]]n government in 1945, the [[North Korean Provisional People's Committee]] began a [[language planning]] campaign on the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] model.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Language and Ethnic Identity: The Success-Failure Continuum in Language and Ethnic Identity Efforts|volume=2|first=Joshua|last=Fishman|first2=Ofelia|last2=Garcia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|pages=156–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, both North Korean and South Korean [[Hangul]] script was based on the ''Unified Plan'' promulgated in 1933 [[Korea under Japanese rule|under the Japanese]].&lt;ref name="Planning"&gt;{{cite book|title=Language and Language-in-Education Planning in the Pacific Basin|first=R.B.|last=Kaplan|first2=Richard B.|last2=Baldauf Jr.|publisher=Springer|year=2003|pages=39–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of the independent North Korean campaign were to increase [[literacy]], re-standardize Hangul to form a "New Korean" that could be used as a cultural weapon of revolution, and eliminate the use of [[Hanja]] (Chinese characters).&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; The study of [[Russian language|Russian]] was also made compulsory from [[middle school]] onward,&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; and communist terminology—such as [[Workers' Party]], [[Korean People's Army|People's Army]], and [[Korean War|People's Liberation War]]—were rapidly assimilated into Korean.&lt;ref name="Planning"/&gt; The ban on Hanja in 1949 (excepting parenthetical references in scientific and technical publications) was part of a [[language purification]] movement which sought to replace [[Sino-Korean vocabulary]] and [[loanword]]s from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] with native [[neologism]]s on the grounds that they were "reactionary" and separated the literary intelligentsia from the masses.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Planning"/&gt; New dictionaries, monolingual and bilingual Russian-Korean, were to be based on the concept of "self-reliance" (''[[juche]]''); [[place name]]s and [[personal name]]s modeled after Chinese naming practices were also purged and replaced with socialist concepts.&lt;ref name="Planning"/&gt;

In 1948, the ''New Korean Orthography'' was promulgated, along with the ''Standard Language Orthography Dictionary''.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; The [[Communist Party of Korea]] claimed that this New Orthography was the first in [[History of Korea|Korean history]] to represent the language of the [[proletariat]].&lt;ref name="Planning"/&gt; The only publications to use the New Korean Orthography were the linguistics journal ''Korean Language Research'' and the 1949 ''Korean Grammar''.&lt;ref name="Brief"&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea Briefing: Toward Reunification|editor1-first=David R.|editor1-last=McCann|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=1997|first=Ross|last=King|chapter=Language, Politics, and Ideology in the Postwar Koreas|pages=124–126, 128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language standardization efforts were interrupted by the [[Korean War]] and hampered by [[Kim Il Sung]]'s disapproval of the new orthography.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; In March 1958, the new orthography's creator, [[Kim Tu Bong]], was purged from the Party, and linguistics journals began publishing attacks on him and his system.&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt; From then on, proposals for script reform were restricted to the idea of writing Hangul horizontally, rather than in syllable blocks. Linguistic journals also continued to attack "foreignisms" from Chinese and English (e.g., ''pai pai/bai bai'' {{lang|ko|바이 바이}}, "bye bye").&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt; In the 1960s, Kim Il Sung issued a directive that would bind all future language planning to [[Korean ethnic nationalism]], saying that "people of the same racial make-up, the same culture, living in the same territory... [have a] need for a nationalistic, pure standard". Thus, [[Pyongan dialect]] was chosen as the [[standard dialect]] for North Korean, purely for the reason that it was considered less "contaminated" by foreign cultures and capitalists.&lt;ref name="Planning"/&gt; The legacy of the New Korean Orthography lies in North Korea's modern use of Hangul, which reflects [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] more than pronunciation as it does in the South.&lt;ref name="North"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Northern Region of Korea: History, Identity, and Culture|first=Sun Joo|last=Kim|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2010|pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NOoK-example.png|thumb|Seven words written in New Orthography. The standard spellings are 놉니다, 흘렀다, 깨달으니, 지어, 고와, 왕, and 가져서.]]
The reason for the reform is that some Korean roots change form and therefore cannot be written with a consistent spelling using standard hangul. The additional letters introduced in the ''New Orthography'' do not represent new sounds, but these situations where a sound changes, say from a /p/ to a /w/. Three were created ''de novo'' by modifying existing letters, two (ㅿ and ㆆ) were obsolete letters, and one (1) is a numeral.

For example, the root of the verb "to walk" has the form 걷 ''kŏt-'' before a consonant, as in the inflection 걷다 ''kŏtta,'' but the form 걸 ''kŏl-'' before a vowel, as in 걸어 ''kŏrŏ'' and 걸으니 ''kŏrŭni.'' In ''New Orthography,'' the root is an invariable {{Script/Korean|거ᇫ}}, spelled with the new letter ㅿ in place of both the ㄷ in 걷 and the ㄹ in 걸: {{Script/Korean|거ᇫ다}} ''kŏtta,'' {{Script/Korean|거ᇫ어}} ''kŏrŏ.''

Another example is the root of the verb "to heal", which has the form 낫 ''nas-'' before a consonant, as in 낫다 ''natta,'' but the form 나 before a vowel, as in 나아 ''naa.'' In some cases, there is an epenthetic ''ŭ'' vowel before a consonant suffix, as in 나을 ''naŭl.'' In ''New Orthography,'' this variable root is written as an invariable {{Script/Korean|나ᇹ}}, and the epenthetic vowel is not written: {{Script/Korean|나ᇹ다}} &lt;small&gt;NA’.DA&lt;/small&gt; for 낫다 ''natta,'' {{Script/Korean|나ᇹᄅ}} &lt;small&gt;NA’.L&lt;/small&gt; for 나을 ''naŭl,'' {{Script/Korean|나ᇹ아}} &lt;small&gt;NA’.A&lt;/small&gt; for 나아 ''naa.''

As with all letters in North Korea, the names follow the formula ''CiŭC.'' For convenience they are also called 여린리을, 된리을, 반시읏, 여린히읗, 위읍, and 여린이.

The ''New Orthography'' also added two new [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] to the lexicon, ㅭ ''{{IPA|lʔ}}'' and ᇬ ''{{IPA|ŋk}}''.

There were other changes that made the orthography more morphemic, without requiring the addition of new letters. For example, in the word normally spelled 놉니다 (top example in image at right), the politeness morpheme ㅂ is separated out in its own block. Such spellings can be found in medieval documents, but were not normally seen in the 20th century.

The attributive ㄴ ''n'' morpheme at the ends of adjectives is also placed in a separate block, and the occasional epenthetic ''ŭ'' that appears before it is not written, unlike standard 은 ''ŭn.'' A morphemic ''h'' is retained before this ending: 하얗다 &lt;small&gt;HA.YAH.DA&lt;/small&gt; ''hayata'' "is white", 하얗ㄴ &lt;small&gt;HA.YAH.N&lt;/small&gt; ''hayan'' "white" (standard 하얀 &lt;small&gt;HA.YAN&lt;/small&gt;). 좋다 &lt;small&gt;CHOH.DA&lt;/small&gt; ''jota'' "is good", 좋ㄴ &lt;small&gt;CHOH.N&lt;/small&gt; ''chohŭn'' "good" (standard 좋은 &lt;small&gt;CHOH.ŬN&lt;/small&gt;).

[[Image:Pora.png|thumb|right|The "rising sun" of Pora! symbolizes a new dawn.]]

'''Pora!''' ({{lang-uk|Пора!}}), meaning ''It's time!'' in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], is a civic youth organization (Black Pora!) and political party in [[Ukraine]] ([[Pora#The political party|Yellow Pora!]]) espousing [[nonviolent resistance]] and advocating increased national [[democracy]]. The group was established in 2004 (as only a civic youth organization) to coordinate young people's opposition to the Kuchma government in opposition to what they claimed was the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] governing style of Ukraine's president [[Leonid Kuchma]]. After the [[Orange Revolution]] Pora! split up in two different entities, Black Pora! (since 2006 OPORA) and Yellow Pora!

==The civic youth organization==
Pora! was inspired and partly trained by members of the [[Serbia]]n [[Otpor!|Otpor]] movement which helped bring down President [[Slobodan Milošević]], and is also allied to related movements throughout [[Eastern Europe]], including [[Kmara]] in the republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (itself partly responsible for the downfall of President [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]), [[Zubr (political organization)|Zubr]] in [[Belarus]] (opposing President [[Alexander Lukashenko]]), [[Oborona]] in [[Russia]], and [[MJAFT!]] in [[Albania]].

According to Pora! has never received U.S. funding and that while 10 members traveled to Serbia in the spring of 2004 and met with Otpor leaders at a seminar in the city of [[Novi Sad]], they paid for themselves.

Prior to the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], pro-democracy movements such as Pora! had created political networks throughout Ukraine, including 150 groups responsible for spreading information and coordinating election monitoring, 72 regional centers, and 30,000 registered participants. This allowed Pora! to mobilize protesters after widespread reports of electoral fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kalil|Kalil, Thomas]]. (2008) Harnessing the Mobile Revolution. The New Policy Institute. Pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Pora! supported [[Viktor Yushchenko]] in [[protest]]s following the disputed 2004 presidential election. It claimed to have about 10,000 members. Its methods have apparently been influenced by [[Gene Sharp]]'s manual ''[[From Dictatorship to Democracy]]''. Apart from the mass demonstrations of the "[[Orange Revolution]]", the group's tactics have included the use of visually striking posters showing confrontational images such as a giant boot crushing a cockroach, and stickers with "revolutionary" slogans such as "Time to Arise!". Not surprisingly, this has aroused the ire of the Ukrainian authorities and Pora! activists have often been harassed and arrested. Pora! activists where arrested in October 2004, but the release of many (on what was reported [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]]'s personal order) gave growing confidence to the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;pg=PA345 Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present] edited by Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash, [[Oxford University Press]], 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}} (page 345)&lt;/ref&gt; Pora! was seen as being on the radical wing of the reform movement.

==The split==
After the success of the [[Orange Revolution]] in defeating election fraud, early 2005 Pora has formally split into two branches with different goals for the future.&lt;ref name=JTFsplitP&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=27471 PORA! TAKES TWO DIFFERENT PATHS], [[The Jamestown Foundation]] (1 February 2005&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The difference, however, always existed without being publicly known, between the original Black Pora! - a student movement associated with civic resistance and anti-[[Kuchma]] campaigns  and the Yellow Pora! - organized by a group of politicians more closely connected to oppositional parties in the Parliament - such as Nasha Ukraina ([[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]]) of [[Viktor Yuschenko]] and PRP ([[Reforms and Order Party]]).&lt;ref name=JTFsplitP/&gt;

[[PORA#The political party|Yellow Pora]] stated in January 2005 it focused on spreading its "revolution" to other countries, particularly [[Belarus]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=TJFYPexpOR/&gt; A [[PORA (Russian youth group)|Russian wing of Yellow PORA]] was created in December 2004 in order to harness the experience of successful democratic revolutions in Serbia, Georgia, and Ukraine (pora.org.ru).&lt;ref name=TJFYPexpOR&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=27717 BEREZOVSKY HOPES TO SELL ORANGE REVOLUTION TO RUSSIA], [[The Jamestown Foundation]] (17 March 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==OPORA==
Black Pora, functions mainly as a pro-democracy watchdog trying to clean Ukraine of 'Kuchmizm' (i.e. the legacy of the former authoritarian President Leonid Kuchma) and does not see the possibility of exporting its experience to other countries. Black Pora! remains a non-partizan movement and has formally registered as an NGO - All-Ukrainian Civic Organization Pora! Part of its public campaigns - such as the one aimed at pressuring major political parties to clean their electoral lists of notorious personalities - connected to the old regime or having criminal background. Around the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|March 2006 Parliamentary elections]] Black Pora changed its name to '''OPORA''' (Foundation) ({{lang-uk|ОПОРА}}).&lt;ref name=Minnesota&gt;[http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/91521/1/Shyyan_Vitaliy%20Sept%202008.pdf DEMOCRACY IN UKRAINE AFTER THE ORANGE REVOLUTION] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716075251/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/91521/1/Shyyan_Vitaliy%20Sept%202008.pdf |date=2010-07-16 }} by [[Vitaliy Shyyan]], [[University of Minnesota]] (September 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Participatory politics''' or '''parpolity''' is a theoretical political system proposed by [[Stephen Shalom]], professor of political science at [[William Paterson University]] in [[New Jersey]].

It was developed as a political vision to accompany [[participatory economics]] (parecon). Both parecon and parpolity together make up the [[libertarian socialist]] ideology of [[participism]]; this has significantly informed the International Organization for a Participatory Society. Shalom has stated that parpolity is meant as a long-range vision of where the [[social justice]] movement might want to end up within the field of politics.

The values on which parpolity is based are [[Political freedom|freedom]], [[Workers' self-management|self-management]], [[justice]], [[Wikt:solidarity|solidarity]], and [[Toleration|tolerance]]. The goal, according to Shalom, is to create a political system that will allow people to participate as much as possible in a face-to-face manner. The proposed decision-making principle is that every person should have say in a decision proportionate to the degree to which she or he is affected by that decision.

The vision is critical of aspects of modern [[representative democracies]] arguing that the level of political control by the people is not sufficient. To address this problem parpolity suggests a system of Nested Councils, which would include every adult member of a given society.

==Nested Councils==

[[File:Nested council.png|thumb|right|upright=2.0|A diagram of the nested council structure.]]

In a parpolity, there would be local councils of voting citizens consisting of 25–50 members (number of represented citizens should not exceed approximately 300 per council member). These local councils would be able to pass any law that affected only the local council. No higher council would be able to override the decisions of a lower council, only a council court would be able to challenge a local law on [[human rights]] grounds. The councils would be based on [[consensus]], though majority votes are allowed when issues cannot be agreed upon.

Each local council would send a delegate to a higher level council, until that council fills with 25–50 members. These second level councils would pass laws on matters that affect the 200,000 to 750,000 citizens that it represents. A delegate to a higher level council is bound to communicate the views of their sending council, but is not bound to vote as the sending council might wish. Otherwise, Shalom points out that there is no point in having nested councils, and everyone might as well vote on everything. A delegate is recallable at any time by their sending council. Rotation of delegates would be mandatory, and delegates would be required to return to their sending councils frequently.

The second level council sends a delegate to a third level council, the third level councils send delegates to a fourth level and so on until all citizens are represented. Five levels with 50 people on every council would represent 312,500,000 voters (around the population of the United States). However, the actual number of people represented would be even higher, given that young children would not be voting. Thus, with a further sixth level nested council, the entire human population could be represented. This would not however be equatable to a global world state, but rather would involve the dissolution of all existing nation-states and their replacement with a worldwide [[confederal]] "coordinating body" made of delegates immediately recallable by the nested council below them.

Lower level councils have the opportunity to hold [[Referendum|referenda]] at any time to challenge the decisions of a higher level council. This would theoretically be an easy procedure, as when a threshold of lower level councils call for a referendum, one would then be held. Shalom points out that sending every issue to lower level councils is a waste of time, as it is equivalent to referendum democracy.

There would be staff employed to help manage council affairs. Their duties would perhaps include minute taking and researching issues for the council. These council staff would work in a balanced job complex defined by a participatory economy.

==Council Courts==

Shalom suggests that a council court be formed of 41 randomly chosen citizens that have two-year terms. Shalom claims that the number 41 ensures a broad range of opinions, although he says that this number is just a suggestion and it could be lower or higher as long as it was big enough for a diversity of opinion but small enough for discussion and debate. This court would be a check against the [[tyranny of the majority]]. It would rule on laws passed and would be able to [[veto]] them if the court deemed them contrary to human rights. Shalom argues the council court should be unelected, as elected members could hold the biases of an oppressive majority.

The two-year terms of the council would be staggered: As 21 reached the one-year midpoint of their term, the other 20 would reach the end of their two-year term and be replaced by a new group of 20. A year later, when that new group of 20 reached the midpoint of their term, the older group of 21 would reach the end of their term, to be replaced by a new group of 21.

It is not clear how the court would operate, i.e. by majority vote or by consensus. The council court would also have the right to rule on which council, economic or political, has a right to vote on a given issue. A dispute between councils would presumably be resolved by this court, for instance if a minority population insists that its vote should count for more than the larger population, as the majority wants to cause environmental damage to a lake that the minority lives near. The council court would be responsible for evaluating this claim, and many different possible rulings could be given. The guiding principle would be that those most affected by the decision would have the most say.

Regular [[Criminal justice|criminal courts]] would remain essentially the same, though there might be more juries.

==Law enforcement==

Shalom argues that police will be necessary even in a participatory society, as you cannot expect crime to disappear even in a good society. Also, police work is a specialized occupation, demanding specialized skills. Police work would be part of a balanced job complex and would be scrutinized by independent review boards.

==Media==

Shalom notes that a vibrant and diverse media is essential for a functioning democracy. A participatory economy would have consumers of media indicating the types of media they desire, and these would be generated according to demand. To help ensure diversity, Shalom recommends that media that show [[debate]]s and encourage diverse viewpoints should be given extra funding.

The '''Prison Policy Initiative''' ('''PPI''') is a [[criminal justice]] oriented American public policy [[think tank]] based in [[Easthampton, Massachusetts]]. It is a [[non-profit organization]], designated [[501(c)(3)]] by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. It is the "leading public critic"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonpolicy.org/news/globe09262004.html Head count: | Prison Policy Initiative&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States Census Bureau]]'s practice of counting prisoners as residents of the towns where they are incarcerated, and has conducted research in several states proving that this practice results in distortion of equal representation.

The Prison Policy Initiative's publications include "Importing Constituents: Prisoners and Political Clout in New York", "Why the Census Bureau can and must start collecting the home addresses of incarcerated people", and "Phantom constituents in the Empire State: How outdated Census Bureau methodology burdens New York counties". It has also published the Democracy Toolkit [https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/toolkit], an internet tool designed for rural democracy activists, allowing them to use PPI's research procedures to study their own communities.

==Census work==
PPI published the first empirical, district-by-district analysis of the effects of [[Census Bureau]] methodology which counts prisoners as residents of towns containing prisons, not their pre-incarceration addresses, and has since been the leading critic of the practice (which it calls "prisoner miscount") and the distortion of equal representation it causes.  Executive director Peter Wagner has testified on the issue before the [[National Academies]] and the New York State Legislative Task Force on Demographic Research and Apportionment. The Census Bureau's scientific advisors at the [[United States National Research Council]] have now recommended that the Bureau begin to collect prisoners' home address information, and the ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial board has repeatedly supported PPI's calls for reform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonpolicy.org/news.html In the News | Prison Policy Initiative&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Once an unknown issue, the problem of prisoner miscount has now been identified as "the most controversial issue for the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07227/809461-109.stm No prison like home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prison and jail telephone industry==
PPI's two reports on the prison and jail phone industry explain why the industry must be regulated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. The reports explain that prison phone bills are so high because of a unique market failure: prison systems and local jails award monopoly contracts to the phone company that will charge the highest rates and share as much as 84% of the profits with the facility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/report.html The Price To Call Home: State-Sanctioned Monopolization In The Prison Phone Industry &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The real customers, the families paying the hefty bills, are left entirely out of the decision-making process. In fact, both parties to these contracts profit from disregarding the interests of the actual consumers of prison telephone services. Aside from the high rates, fees also have an enormous impact on prison phone bills, making up 38% of the $1 billion annual price of calling home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/pleasedeposit.html Please Deposit All of Your Money: Kickbacks, Rates, and Hidden Fees in the Jail Phone Industry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jail letter bans==
The Prison Policy Initiative published the first-in-the-nation report on the new jail trend of banning letters from home and requiring loved ones to write on public postcards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonpolicy.org/postcards/report.html Return to Sender: Postcard-only Mail Policies in Jails]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute of Corrections]] called the report, "required reading for policy makers and anyone working with individuals in jail custody."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nicic.gov/Library/027412 National Institute of Corrections Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing enhancement zones==
Many states have laws that enhance sentences based on where an offense takes place. These laws aim to deter offenses near places such as schools, but when the protected areas are too big, the deterrence effect is lost and these policies end up increasing harmful racial disparities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonpolicy.org/zones.html "Sentencing Enhancement Zones" fail to protect children and worsen racial disparity in incarceration]&lt;/ref&gt; The Prison Policy Initiative's research demonstrated that a Massachusetts drug law that set the penalty by where the offense is located — and not the harm caused by the offense — does not work, can never work, and has serious negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonpolicy.org/toofar/ The Geography of Punishment: How Huge Sentencing Enhancement Zones Harm Communities, Fail to Protect Children]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonpolicy.org/toofar/ Reaching Too Far, Coming Up Short: How Large Sentencing Enhancement Zones Miss the Mark]&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations of the Prison Policy Initiative's two reports were endorsed by Massachusetts Governor [[Deval Patrick]] and led to a change in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valleyadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=13128 Rethinking Drug-Free School Zones], ''[[The Valley Advocate]]'', February 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Propiska quota''' ({{Lang-ru|лимит прописки, limit propiski}}) was a notion associated with ''[[propiska in the Soviet Union|propiska]]'', the system of residential permits and registration in major cities of the [[Soviet Union]]. The persons who fell within the propiska quota were known as '''limitchiks''' (лимитчик), from the Russian word "лимит" ("limit") for "quota".

To control growth of a number of major cities in the country the influx of non-native residents was severely limited . These cities were dubbed "regime cities" (режимные города), from the term "special regime of ''propiska''". Still, there existed an imbalance between certain categories of required job positions and the supply of the corresponding workforce. Therefore certain enterprises and services had an access to the system of "''propiska'' quotas" to invite a certain number of workers per year. Major beneficiaries were [[defense industry]], construction workers and street cleaners. 

The system of "regime cities" produced an unexpected adverse effect of depletion of skilled engineers and other specialists in provinces. Most prestigious educational centers were in the "regime cities", and students of these institutes tried hard to remain there, knowing that once departed, they could never return to the place with higher living standards.

The '''''Rassemblement Wallonie France''''' ('''Rally Wallonia France''', '''RWF''') is a small political party in [[Belgium]]. It is active in [[Wallonia]] and the [[Brussels-Capital Region]]. In Brussels it is known as the '''Rassemblement Bruxelles France''' or '''RBF'''. Its aim is the secession of Wallonia, Brussels and the six Flemish [[municipalities with language facilities]] for French-speakers around Brussels from Belgium and to unite them with France.

The party's symbol is the red rooster, from the [[Flag of Wallonia|representing Wallonia]], inside a hexagon, which is a common geometric representation of France. The blue, white, and red represent the colours of the [[Flag of France|French national flag]].

==History==
[[File:France-Wallonie-Bruxelles in red.svg|thumb|right|France, [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]] united]]
Defending the principles of republicanism, democracy, pluralism, and socialism, the party was founded on 27 November 1999 in [[Charleroi]]. It was established on the basis of a reconciliation between three organisations: Andre Libert's [[Walloon Rally|Rassemblement Wallon]] (RW); Paul-Henry Gendebien's Democratic Alliance Wallone (AWD), which was formed in 1985 when Gendebien left the [[Centre démocrate humaniste|Social Christian Party]] (PSC); and the Walloon Movement for the Return to France (RF), chaired by Maurice Lebeau.

In the [[Belgian federal election, 2003|2003 federal elections]], the party was presented under the label "RWF-RBF". It was presented again under the label "RWF" in the [[Belgian federal election, 2007|2007 federal elections]], and received 1.5% of votes in the Senate against 1.2% in the Chamber of Representatives in Wallonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.lesoir.be/legislatives-2007/resultats/index.html|title=Le Royaume – Résultats – LeSoir.be|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217033217/http://elections.lesoir.be/legislatives-2007/resultats/index.html|archivedate=17 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RWF is present in every election in Wallonia and Brussels. In the [[Belgian regional elections, 2009|2009 regional elections]], the party won 1.37% of the vote for the Walloon Parliament. In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Belgium)|2009 European elections]], it won 0.43% of the vote in the [[French-speaking electoral college]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.lesoir.be/elections-2009/static/1138-r.html |title=Elections 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611150825/http://elections.lesoir.be/elections-2009/static/1138-r.html |archivedate=11 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


The RWF was refounded in 2010 on the proposal of President Paul-Henry Gendebien and the Executive Board.

In March 2012, the Constitutional Convention elected Laurent Brogniet as the new President of the RWF, and Paul-Henry Gendebien became founding president. New statutes were subject to the approval of Congress.

The party was founded in January 2015 by [[Gaetano Armao]], a former regional minister of Economy under President [[Raffaele Lombardo]], and [[Rino Piscitello]], a long-time politician ([[Proletarian Unity Party (Italy)|Proletarian Unity Party]], [[Proletarian Democracy]], [[The Network (political party)|The Network]], [[The Democrats (Italy)|The Democrats]], [[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy|Democracy is Freedom]], [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]) who had lately been the secretary of Lombardo's [[Party of Sicilians]]. The party aimed at the transformation of Sicily into a nation confederated to Italy or an independent country.&lt;ref&gt;http://livesicilia.it/2015/01/16/armao-fonda-sicilia-nazione-contro-lo-scippo-dellautonomia_587059&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://giornalelora.com/politica/nasce-sicilia-nazione-con-armao-e-piscitello&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Story of the Daughters of Quchan: Gender and National Memory in Iranian History''''' is a 1998 [[political history]] book written by [[Afsaneh Najmabadi]].  It explores a 1905 occurrence of [[human trafficking]] in [[Iran]].  "The Daughters of Quchan" refers to a group of about two hundred fifty girls from the district of [[Quchan]], who were kidnapped and sold by the local government in lieu of a [[tax]].

==Synopsis==
This story is an example of one of the many unjust acts by both the provincial governments and the national [[Qajar Regime]] which led to the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]]. In the province of [[Quchan]], the provincial governor, Asaf al-Dawlah, set a [[flat tax]] for all of the people, regardless of their income. The poor could not afford to pay this tax, due to a bad harvest, and the only way they could raise the money was to sell their daughters to the elite [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] or to [[nomad]]s. Turkmen also began raiding the village and capturing the women. When the citizens begged for payment postponement, they were shot and killed by provincial government officials.

About two hundred and fifty girls had been sold and they became known as “The Daughters of Quchan”. This incident portrays Iranian women as being “objects of traffic” and clearly speaks to the issue of poverty and the social injustice people faced under this government. The people of Quchan went to the central government to protest and ask for help. Finally an investigator was sent to Quchan, who was bribed by the provincial governor, and did not report the inequality to the central government. The citizens went back to the central government again to protest and eventually the issue was resolved. This story was published in [[newspaper]]s all over Iran and caused a public outcry for social justice and a parliamentary government. Muhammad Husayn Tabataba’i, one of the most prominent [[philosopher]]s of the time, was particularly irate and argued that the government was not addressing the needs of the people:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Have you not heard the tale of Quchan where they had a bad harvest last year? Each Quchani [[Muslim]] had to pay three dozen kilos of [[wheat]] in lieu of taxes. They did not have it and nobody helped them out. Instead of wheat, the local ruler took three hundred Muslim daughters, counted each daughter for three dozen kilos of wheat, and sold them to the Turkmens. Some of the daughters were separated from their mothers while they were asleep, because the poor souls would not consent to be separated. Now tell me in all fairness! Can you imagine a worse oppression? Every place is in ruins."(88)&lt;ref&gt;Najmabadi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
It also showed how effective newspapers were at relaying information across the country as many Iranians sympathized for those in Quchan and would join the cause in [[protest]]ing for a constitutional government. Asaf al-Dawlah and many of his high-ranking officials were put on trial under the new regime in 1906 and there were multiple efforts made to get the girls back from the Turkmens. While some girls were rescued and brought back to their paternal families, the majority of girls were not found. “The Daughters of Quchan” is one of many events which were instrumental to promoting the Constitutional Revolution as the Iranian citizens began to realize that they were tired of living under an oppressive government.

The '''United States Department of Agriculture''' ('''USDA'''), also known as the '''Agriculture Department''', is the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.]] [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive department]] responsible for developing and executing federal laws related to farming, forestry, and food. It aims to meet the needs of farmers and ranchers, promote agricultural trade and production, work to assure food safety, protect natural resources, foster rural communities and end hunger in the United States and internationally. 

Approximately 80% of the USDA's $141 billion budget goes to the [[Food and Nutrition Service]] (FNS) program. The largest component of the FNS budget is the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (formerly known as the Food Stamp program), which is the cornerstone of USDA's nutrition assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/HISTORY%20OF%20FNS.pdf |title=History of FNS |website=usda.gov |access-date=July 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912141202/http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/HISTORY%20OF%20FNS.pdf |archive-date=2016-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] is [[Sonny Perdue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/usda-food-stamps-school-lunch-trump-administration |title=Inside Trump's Cruel Campaign Against the U.S.D.A.'s Scientists |author=[[Michael Lewis]] |date=November 2017 |website=[[VanityFair.com]] |access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Many of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of America and providing nourishment as well as [[Nutrition Education|nutrition education]] to those in need are run and operated under the USDA Food and Nutrition Service. Activities in this program include the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]], which provides healthy food to over 40 million low-income and homeless people each month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/ |title=FNS Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) |date=2013-06-21 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; USDA is a member of the [[United States Interagency Council on Homelessness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usich.gov/member_agency |title=United States Interagency Council on Homelessness |website=USICH |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424055302/http://www.usich.gov/member_agency |archive-date=2012-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is committed to working with other agencies to ensure these mainstream benefits are accessed by those experiencing homelessness.

The USDA also is concerned with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both the domestic and world markets. It plays a role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. This aid can go through [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], foreign governments, international bodies such as [[World Food Program]], or approved nonprofits. The [[Agricultural Act of 1949]], section 416 (b) and  [[Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954]], also known as [[Food for Peace]], provides the legal basis of such actions. The USDA is a partner of the [[World Cocoa Foundation]].

==History==
[[File:Harvey Wiley, Chief Chemist of the Department of Agriculture’s Division of Chemistry (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Harvey Washington Wiley]], Chief Chemist of the Department of Agriculture's Division of Chemistry (third from the right) with his staff, not long after he joined the division in 1883]]

===Origins===
Early in its history, the [[economy of the United States]] was largely [[agrarian economy|agrarian]]. Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds, plants and animals for import into the United States. In 1837 [[Henry Leavitt Ellsworth]], a Yale-educated attorney interested in improving agriculture, became Commissioner of Patents, a position within the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. He began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the [[United States Congress|Congress]] and agricultural societies. In 1839, Congress established the Agricultural Division within the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|Patent Office]] and allotted $1,000 for "the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes."{{cn|date=May 2017}} Ellsworth's interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the new seeds and plants, a clerk to collect agricultural statistics, statewide reports about crops in different regions, and the application of chemistry to agriculture. Ellsworth was called the "Father of the Department of Agriculture."{{cn|date=May 2017}}

In 1849, the Patent Office was transferred to the newly created [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. In the ensuing years, agitation for a separate [[Government agency|bureau]] of agriculture within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

===Formation and subsequent history===
[[File:Main Building of the Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. (no original caption) - NARA - 512817.jpg|thumb|right|The first [[United_States_Department_of_Agriculture_Building|Department of Agriculture Building]] on the National Mall around 1895]]
[[File:USDA Bldg., Washington, D.C. IMG 4787.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Jamie L. Whitten Building]] in [[Washington D.C.]] is the USDA headquarters.]]
On May 15, 1862, [[Abraham Lincoln]] established the independent Department of Agriculture to be headed by a commissioner without Cabinet status, and the agriculturalist [[Isaac Newton (agriculturalist)|Isaac Newton]] was appointed to be the first such commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;12 Stat. 387, now codified at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/07/2201- 7 U.S.C. § 2201].&lt;/ref&gt;  Lincoln called it the "people's department."

In 1868, the Department moved into the new [[United_States_Department_of_Agriculture_Building|Department of Agriculture Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] designed by famed DC architect [[Adolf Cluss]]. Located on Reservation No.2 on the [[National Mall]] between 12th Street and 14th SW, the Department had offices for its staff and the entire width of the Mall up to B Street NW to plant and experiment with plants.&lt;ref&gt;Evening Star - June 18, 1868 - page 4 - column 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, varied [[advocacy group]]s were lobbying for Cabinet representation. Business interests sought a Department of Commerce and Industry, and farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank. In 1887, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] passed bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor, but the bill was defeated in [[conference committee]] after farm interests objected to the addition of labor. Finally, on February 9, 1889, President [[Grover Cleveland]] signed a bill into law elevating the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet level.&lt;ref&gt;25 Stat 659 (February 9, 1889)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, the [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] provided for the federal funding of [[agricultural experiment station]]s in each state. The [[Smith-Lever Act of 1914]] then funded [[cooperative extension service]]s in each state to teach agriculture, [[home economics]], and other subjects to the public. With these and similar provisions, the USDA reached out to every county of every state.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

During the [[Great Depression]], farming remained a common way of life for millions of Americans. The Department of Agriculture's [[Bureau of Home Economics]], established in 1923, published shopping advice and recipes to stretch family budgets and make food go farther.&lt;ref name="Square Meal"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ziegelman |first1=Jane |last2=Coe |first2=Andrew |title=A Square Meal: A Culinary History of the Great Depression |date=2016 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-221641-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; USDA helped ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it, assisted with loans for small landowners, and contributed to the education of the rural youth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

It was revealed on August 27th, 2018 that the U.S. Department of Agriculture would be providing U.S. farmers with a farm aid package, which will total $4.7 billion in direct payments to American farmers. This package is meant to offset the losses farmers are expected to incur from retaliatory tariffs placed on American exports during the [[Trump tariffs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-farmers/u-s-government-to-pay-4-7-billion-in-tariff-related-aid-to-farmers-idUSKCN1LC23X|title=U.S. government to pay $4.7 billion in tariff-related aid to farmers|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization, budget and tasks==

The Department of Agriculture was authorized a budget for [[2015 United States federal budget|Fiscal Year 2015]] of $139.7 billion. The budget authorization is broken down as follows:&lt;ref name=budget&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.obpa.usda.gov/budsum/FY15budsum.pdf |title=FY 2015 Budget Summary and Annual Performance Plan |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture |access-date=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack expressed the desire to resign to President Obama. The Washington Post reports that he said "There are days when I have literally nothing to do," he recalled thinking as he weighed his decision to quit."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jaffe |first1=Greg |last2=Eilperin |first2=Juliet |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/tom-vilsacks-lonely-fight-for-a-forgotten-rural-america/2016/09/26/62d7ee64-7830-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html |title=Tom Vilsack’s lonely fight for a ‘forgotten’ rural America |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 26, 2016 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama did not accept his resignation but assigned him additional tasks of combating opioid addiction, a task usually not assigned to the Department of Agriculture.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;

==Discrimination==
Allegations have been made that throughout the agency's history its personnel have discriminated against farmers of various backgrounds, denying them loans and access to other programs well into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=General Accounting Office |url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/rc99038.pdf |title=USDA - Problems Continue to Hinder the Timely Processing of Discrimination Complaints |date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of this discrimination has been the reduction in the number of African-American farmers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brooks |first=Roy L. |title=Atonement and Forgiveness: A New Model for Black Reparations |date= |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location= |isbn=0-520-24813-9 |pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- similar case, Garcia v. Veneman, sought to protect Hispanic farmers from the same sort of discrimination, and Love v. Vilsack was filed on behalf of female farmers--&gt; Many black farmers across the nation experienced discrimination in their dealings with in-state USDA agencies. Across the nation, black farmers alleged, and the USDA later agreed, they were denied access to loans and subsidies provided by the government.&lt;ref name=nytimes1&gt;{{cite news |agency=ASSOCIATED PRESS |date=April 15, 1999 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0D9143BF936A25757C0A96F958260 |title=Judge Approves Settlement for Black Farmers |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a national level, farm subsidies that were afforded to white farmers were not afforded to black farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/PersonOfWeek/story?id=131844&amp;page=1 |title=ABC World News Tonight (2003) |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2003-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since they were denied government loans, emergency or disaster assistance, and other aid, many black farmers lost their farms and homes.&lt;ref name=BenEvans1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-06-28-1736680923_x.htm |author=Ben Evans |agency=Associated Press |title=Reopening black farmers' suits could cost billions |publisher=USA Today |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the USDA settled a class action lawsuit, the [[Pigford v. Glickman|Pigford Case]], alleging discrimination against African-American farmers in the late twentieth century. The government's settlement of nearly $1 billion with more than 13,300 farmers was reportedly the largest civil rights claim to date.&lt;ref name="Pickert"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2006058,00.html?xid=rss-fullnation-yahoo|title = When Shirley Sherrod Was First Wronged by the USDA|first = Kate|last = Pickert|date = July 23, 2010|work = [[Time Magazine|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 Farm Bill provided for additional farmers to have their claims heard, as 70,000 had filed late in the original program.&lt;ref name="Pickert"/&gt; In 2010 the federal government made another $1.2 billion settlement in what is called ''Pigford II'' for outstanding claims.&lt;ref name=CRS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RS20430.pdf |authors=Tadlock Cowan and Jody Feder |title=The Pigford Cases: USDA Settlement of Discrimination Suits by Black Farmers |publisher=Congressional Research Service |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following long-standing concerns, black farmers joined a [[class action]] discrimination suit against the USDA filed in federal court in 1997.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt; An attorney called it "the most organized, largest civil rights case in the history of the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/race_relations/jan-june99/farmers_3-2.html |title=PBS The News Hour (1999) |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1997, black farmers from at least five states held protests in front of the USDA headquarters in [[Washington, DC|Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7QOUqVlu5IC |title=Homecoming: The Story of African-American Farmers |authors=Charlene Gilbert, Quinn Eli |publisher=Beacon Press |date=2002 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests in front of the USDA were a strategy employed in later years as the black farmers sought to keep national attention focused on the plight of the black farmers. Representatives of the [[National Black Farmers Association]] met with President [[Bill Clinton]] and other administration officials at the [[White House]]. And NBFA's president testified before the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FywV4yVN5iIC |title=Treatment of minority and limited resource producers by the U.S. Department of Agriculture: ... |publisher=U.S. G.P.O. |date=Jan 1, 1997 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Pigford v. Glickman]]'', U.S. Federal District Court Judge [[Paul L. Friedman]] approved the settlement and consent decree on April 14, 1999.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt; The settlement recognized discrimination against 22,363 black farmers but the NBFA would later call the agreement incomplete because more than 70,000 were excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLKMFlLhCx0C |title=Where Rebels Roost... Mississippi Civil Rights Revisited |authors=M. Susan Orr Klopfer, Fred Klopfer, Barry Klopfer |publisher=Lulu Press |date=2005 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the settlement was deemed to be the largest-ever civil rights class action settlement in American history. Lawyers estimated the value of the settlement to be more than $2 billion.&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt; Some farmers would have their debts forgiven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1046266 |title=Black Farmers Lawsuit |publisher=NPR |date=March 2, 1999 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Friedman appointed a monitor to oversee the settlement.&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt; Farmers in Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Georgia were among those affected by the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_2_97/ai_58411585 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711212707/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_2_97/ai_58411585 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=Southern farmers among those affected by court case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBFA's president was invited to testify before congress on this matter numerous times following the settlement including before the [[United States Senate Committee on Agriculture]] on September 12, 2000, when he testified that many farmers had not yet received payments and others were left out of the settlement. NBFA asked Congress to pass legislation that would ensure a full resolution of the discrimination cases.{{cn|date=May 2017}} [[Environmental Working Group]] and NBFA issued a report in July 2004 accusing the USDA of withholding nearly three out of every four dollars in the multibillion-dollar settlement of discrimination cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/blackfarmers |title=Obstruction of Justice |website=Environmental Working Group |date=July 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022140301/http://www.ewg.org/reports/blackfarmers |archive-date=2006-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report says that the U.S. Department of Justice and the USDA pursued a path of "willful obstruction of justice" in blocking many of the cases. It was later revealed that one DoJ staff "general attorney" was unlicensed while she was handling black farmers' cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0205/021105lb.htm |title=Unlicensed Hire |author=Daniel Pulliam |website=GOVEXEC.com |date=February 11, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416092038/http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0205/021105lb.htm |archive-date=2005-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NBFA called for all those cases to be reheard.{{cn|date=May 2017}} The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported in 2004 that the result of such longstanding USDA discrimination was that black farmers had been forced out of business at a rate three times faster than white farmers. In 1920, 1 in 7 U.S. farmers was African-American, and by 2004 the number is 1 in 100. USDA spokesman Ed Loyd, when acknowledging that the USDA loan process was unfair to minority farmers, had claimed it was hard to determine the effect on such farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Andrew |last=Martin |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-08-08/news/0408080241_1_national-black-farmers-association-minority-farmers-white-farmers |title=USDA discrimination accused of withering black farmers |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2004-08-08 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) issued a report highly critical of the USDA in its handling of the black farmers cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5362406 |title=Black Farmers Follow Up on USDA Grievances|publisher=National Public Radio |date=25 Apr 2006 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBFA continued to lobby Congress to provide relief. NBFA's Boyd secured congressional support for legislation that would provide $100 million in funds to settle late-filer cases. In 2006 a bill was introduced into the House of Representatives and later the Senate by Senator [[George Felix Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/29/AR2006092900152.html |title=Allen Unveils Bill to Help Black Farmers |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Washington Post |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Boyd testified before the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] about this legislation.{{cn|date=May 2017}} As the organization was making headway by gathering Congressional supporters in 2007 it was revealed that some USDA Farm Services Agency employees were engaged in activities aimed at blocking Congressional legislation that would aid the black farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 8, 2007 |url=http://obama.senate.gov/press/070808-usda_improper_lobbying/ |title=Obama: USDA Should Not Undermine Legislation to Help Black Farmers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081111011207/http://obama.senate.gov/press/070808-usda_improper_lobbying/ |archive-date=2008-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]], then a U.S. Senator, lent his support to the black farmers' issues in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/as-champion-of-black-farmers-obama-could-win-southern-votes-2007-09-19.html |title=The Hill newspaper (2007) |publisher=Thehill.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bill cosponsored by Obama passed the Senate in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://obama.senate.gov/news/071217-senate_votes_to_1/ |title=Senate Votes to Reopen Black Farmers' Lawsuits |date=December 17, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |author=Ben Evans |accessdate=2013-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030221920/http://obama.senate.gov/news/071217-senate_votes_to_1/ |archivedate=2008-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early June 2008 hundreds of black farmers, denied a chance to have their cases heard in the ''Pigford'' settlement, filed a new lawsuit against USDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ben Evans |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jun04/0,4670,BlackFarmersLawsuit,00.html |title=Black farmers file new suit against USDA |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate and House versions of the black farmers bill, reopening black farmers discrimination cases, became law in June 2008.&lt;ref name=BenEvans1/&gt; Some news reports said that the new law could affect up to 74,000 black farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17722777 |title=Help Ahead for Black Farmers |publisher=NPR |date=December 31, 2007 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, the GAO issued a report criticizing the USDA's handling of discrimination complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Etter |first=Lauren |url=http://s.wsj.net/article/SB122472492972861173.html |title=USDA Faulted Over Minority Farmers |publisher=The Wall Street Journal  |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GAO recommended an oversight review board to examine civil rights complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/22/AR2008102203198.html |title=USDA Action On Bias Complaints Is Criticized |publisher=The Washington Post |date= 2008-10-23 |accessdate=2013-12-29 |first=Darryl |last=Fears}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After numerous public rallies and an intensive NBFA member lobbying effort, Congress approved and Obama signed into law in December 2010 legislation that set aside $1.15 billion to resolve the outstanding black farmers cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=CNN Wire Staff |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-08/politics/obama.black.farmers_1_national-black-farmers-association-minority-farmers-glickman-case?_s=PM:POLITICS |title=Obama signs measure funding black farmers settlement |publisher=CNN.com |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2013-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031123858/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-08/politics/obama.black.farmers_1_national-black-farmers-association-minority-farmers-glickman-case?_s=PM%3APOLITICS |archivedate=2012-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NBFA's John W.

It was reported that some had been found fraudulent, or transparently bogus.

Lack of documentation is an issue complicated by the USDA practice of discarding denied applications after three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Opens Spigot After Farmers Claim Discrimination |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/us/farm-loan-bias-claims-often-unsupported-cost-us-millions.html |accessdate=April 26, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 25, 2013 |author=Sharon LaFraniere |quote=...claimants were not required to present documentary evidence that they had been unfairly treated or had even tried to farm.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In 2016, [[Food &amp; Water Watch]] claimed that "when independent, government scientists produce research that threatens corporate agribusinesses, the USDA—according to at least 10 government scientists—censors the results, waters down the findings and punishes the researchers".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/news/usda-censoring-anti-monsanto-science-0|title=USDA Censoring Anti-Monsanto Science?|date=2016-03-09|work=Food &amp; Water Watch|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uusimaa''' is a [[Constituencies of Finland|Finnish constituency]] represented in [[Parliament of Finland|eduskunta]]. It covers the administrative region of [[Uusimaa]], excluding the capital city of [[Helsinki]], which forms [[Helsinki (constituency)|its own constituency]]. Uusimaa elects 35 members to eduskunta, which makes it the largest electoral district in the country.&lt;ref&gt;https://uusimaa.partio.fi/the-guide-and-scout-district-of-uusimaa/&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the city proper is not part of the constituency, much of the area falls under the [[Greater Helsinki]] metropolitan area. The suburban cities [[Espoo]] and [[Vantaa]] account for half of its population of 1 million. The largest party in the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2011|2011 election]] was the [[National Coalition Party]], with the [[Social Democratic Party (Finland)|Social Democratic Party]] second. The [[Green League]] and [[Swedish People's Party]] gained vote share in excess of their national average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uusimaa.fi/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volt Europa''' (frequently abbreviated '''Volt''') is a [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] political movement that serves as the pan-European structure of EU parties for the [[European Parliament election, 2019|European Parliament elections in May 2019]]. It was founded in 2017 by Andrea Venzon, supported by Colombe Cahen-Salvador and Damian Boeselager. The organisation follows a "pan-european approach" in many policy fields such as climate change, migration, economic inequality, international conflict, terrorism and the impact of the technological revolution on the labour market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.volteuropa.org/about|title=About us|work=Volt|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/910294/EU-youth-Volt-European-Parliament-election-United-States-of-Europe-pan-European-party|title=The future of the EU?

== History ==
Volt Europa was founded on March 29, 2017 by [[Andrea Venzon]], supported by [[Colombe Cahen-Salvador]] and [[Damian Boeselager]]. According to the founders, the foundation was a reaction to growing populism in the world and to [[Brexit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wiwo.de/politik/deutschland/zwoelf-sterne-bewegung-jugendpartei-volt-will-europa-umkrempeln/22665188.html|title=Volt: Jugendpartei will die Idee der Europäischen Union retten|website=Wirtschaftswoche|language=de|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/11/03/volt-wants-to-become-the-first-pan-eu-political-party|title=Volt wants to become the first pan-EU political party
|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, the first national subsidiary party was founded in [[Hamburg]], Germany. The subsidiary with the most members is Italy, the home country of Milanese Andrea Venzon, the first ideator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/politico-brussels-playbook-presented-by-the-barilla-foundation-europe-in-4-speeches-new-us-ambassador-a-different-brexit-story/|title=POLITICO Brussels Playbook, presented by the Barilla Foundation: Europe in 4 speeches — New US ambassador — A different Brexit story|last=|first=|date=2018-05-11|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volt is now active with a national movement in every EU member state. 

Volt Europa was incorporated as a non-profit association in Luxembourg under the name Volt Europa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.volteuropa.org/legal|title=Legal|work=Volt|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Vox Europe was the former name of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.corriere.it/esteri/18_febbraio_21/i-millennial-volt-vogliono-dare-scossa-ue-rilanceremo-l-europa-1f79e9fa-16eb-11e8-b630-41a05c9e9642.shtml|title=I millennial di Volt vogliono dare la scossa alla Ue: rilanceremo l’Europa|last=Disegni|first=Simone|work=Corriere della Sera|access-date=2018-06-13|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the movement has ca. 15.000 members in more than 30 European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wiwo.de/politik/deutschland/zwoelf-sterne-bewegung-jugendpartei-volt-will-europa-umkrempeln/22665188.html|title=Volt: Jugendpartei will die Idee der Europäischen Union retten|website=Wirtschaftswoche|language=de|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 70% of the current members are reported to not been politically active before joining Volt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2018/02/15/nous-voulons-creer-le-premier-parti-paneuropeen_1629888|title=«Nous voulons créer le premier parti paneuropéen»|work=Libération.fr|access-date=2018-06-13|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 27, 2018 till October 28, 2018 Volt Europa hosted its General Assembly meeting in [[Amsterdam]], presenting the Amsterdam Declaration programme for the [[European Parliament]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/174422/Nieuwe-partij-wil-van-Europa-een-krachtpatser-maken|title=Nieuwe partij wil van Europa een krachtpatser maken|work=RTV Rijnmond|access-date=2018-10-28|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political agenda ==
Volt Europa has been compared to [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s [[La République En Marche!|La Republique en Marche]] movement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europawahl-105.html|title=Europawahl 2019: Italiener will für die EU begeistern|last=tagesschau.de|website=Tagesschau|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Momentum (organisation)|Momentum]] group&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/910294/EU-youth-Volt-European-Parliament-election-United-States-of-Europe-pan-European-party|title=The future of the EU?

In media reporting, the organisation is described as aiming to foster democracy on the EU level and build European patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/politico-brussels-playbook-presented-by-the-barilla-foundation-europe-in-4-speeches-new-us-ambassador-a-different-brexit-story/|title=POLITICO Brussels Playbook, presented by the Barilla Foundation: Europe in 4 speeches — New US ambassador — A different Brexit story|date=2018-05-11|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stresses the importance of a united European voice that is heard in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europeancircus.blogautore.espresso.repubblica.it/2018/04/04/scende-in-campo-la-generazione-erasmus-una-conversazione-con-andrea-venzon-presidente-di-volt/|title=Scende in campo la generazione Erasmus. Una conversazione con Andrea Venzon, presidente di Volt|work=European Circus|access-date=2018-06-13|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it supports the idea of a federated Europe with a strong European Parliament in which the citizens become the very center of European democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dvořáková |first1=Věra |title=Volt wants to “energise Europe” – but how? |url=https://www.thenewfederalist.eu/volt-wants-to-energise-europe-but-how |website=The New Federalist|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/910294/EU-youth-Volt-European-Parliament-election-United-States-of-Europe-pan-European-party|title=The future of the EU?

Volt is distinct from other pro-European movements such as [[Pulse of Europe]] or the [[European Federalists]] as it aims to participate in European, local and national elections through its subsidiary organisations in EU member states. Its first major objective is the  [[European Parliament election, 2019|European Parliament elections in May 2019]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamburg1.de/nachrichten/34877/Volt_Eine_neue_Partei_fuer_Europa.html|title=Volt - Eine neue Partei für Europa|website=www.hamburg1.de|language=de|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Volt Europa is a transnational party (such as the [[Newropeans]] or the [[European Federalist Party]]) and could be described as supporting the notion of [[demoicracy]]. Volt Europa is supposed to serve as an umbrella organisation to the national subsidiaries. 

Volt Europa also stated that it is on neither the [[Left-wing politics|left]] political spectrum nor the [[Right-wing politics|right]] one, though the party is considered to be leaning more towards the left.{{citation needed|reason= Most Volters describe their party as centrist. I didn't find any data that support the claim that Volt is a left party.|date=November 2018}}

== Election results ==
Volt contested its first elections in the [[Belgian local elections, 2018|2018 local elections in Belgium]], fielding candidates in [[Antwerp]] and two municipalities ([[Ixelles]] and [[Etterbeek]]) in [[Brussels]]. In none of the municipalities seats were gained.
