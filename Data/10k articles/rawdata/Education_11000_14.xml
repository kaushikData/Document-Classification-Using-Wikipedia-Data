[[File:ABC trim ABC.jpg|thumb|180px|A French ABC-book printed in 1861]]

An '''alphabet book''' is a [[book]] primarily designed for young [[children]]. It presents letters of the [[alphabet]] with corresponding words and/or images. Some alphabet books feature [[Capital letter|capitals]] and [[Lowercase letters|lower case letter]] forms, keywords beginning with specific letters, or illustrations of keywords. Alphabet books may consist of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], [[paragraph]]s, or entire pages highlighting letters and corresponding keywords in a variety of creative and imaginative formats.

==Purposes==

Alphabet books introduce the sounds and letters of the ordered [[alphabet]].  These books provide a non-threatening [[genre]] in which children engage in a variety of both fiction and non-fiction texts. Alphabet books provide opportunities for:

#Developing conversations and proficiency in oral language
#Increasing [[phoneme|phonemic]] awareness
#Teaching [[phonics]]
#Making text connections (Activating prior knowledge)
#Predicting (Text talk)
#Building [[wikt:vocabulary|vocabulary]]
#Inferencing / drawing conclusions
#Sequencing
#Identifying elements of story structure
#Recognizing point of view
#Visualizing setting (Time, place and atmosphere)
#Performing Dialogue (Plays and Readers’ Theater)
#Rereading for fluency
#Retelling for comprehension checks
#Engaging [[Multiple Intelligences]] through writing, music, art, Dance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/linguaLinks/literacy/ReferenceMaterials/GlossaryOfLiteracyTerms/WhatIsAnAlphabetBook.htm What is an alphabet book at sil.org] accessed 9 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oldest alphabet book known is Thomas Petyt’s ''The BAC Bothe in Latyn and in Englysshe'' (1538). The first alphabet book to be accompanied by pictures is John Hart’s ''A Methode; or, Comfortable Beginning for All Unlearned'' (1570). &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195146561.001.0001/acref-9780195146561-e-0005|title=ABC Books or Alphabet Books|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195146561.001.0001/acref-9780195146561-e-0005|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hornbooks===

The [[hornbook]], a form of ABC book, was common by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s day. It consisted of a piece of [[parchment]] or paper pasted on a wooden board and protected by a leaf of horn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iupui.edu/~engwft/hornbook.html |title=Indiana University-hornbooks |access-date=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918184354/http://www.iupui.edu/~engwft/hornbook.html |archive-date=18 September 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornbooks displayed letters of the alphabet, a [[wikt:syllabary|syllabary]] and prayers for novice readers. [[Andrew White Tuer|Andrew Tuer]] &lt;ref name=tuer&gt;Tuer, A. W. (1896). A history of the horn-book, vols. 1 &amp; 2. London: Leadenhall Press.&lt;/ref&gt; described a typical hornbook with a line separating the lower case and capital letters from the syllabary. This syllabarium or syllabary, likely added to the hornbook in 1596,&lt;ref name=tuer/&gt; taught pronunciations of vowel and consonant combinations.
:ab eb ib ob ub       ba be bi bo bu
These syllables are possible ancestors to the modern instructional practice of new readers working with [[Syllable onset|onsets]] and [[syllable|rimes]] in word families. From the first hornbook, the alphabet format cemented the learning progression from syllables to words.

An example of the reliance on the alphabet for reading instruction is found in [[John Bunyan]]'s, ''A Book for Boys and Girls, or Country Rhymes for Children.''&lt;ref&gt;Bunyan, John ''A Book for Boys and Girls, or Country Rhymes for Children.'', 1686, London, Printed for N. P. [Nathaniel Ponder].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

:  To those who are in years but Babes I bow
:  My Pen to teach them what the Letters be,
:  And how they may improve their A. B. C.
:  Nor let my pretty Children them despise.
:  All needs must there begin, that would be wise,
:  Nor let them fall under Discouragement,
:  Who at their hornbook stick, and time hath spent,
:  Upon that A. B. C., while others do
:  Into their primer or their [[Psalter]] go.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As referenced in this verse, it was an expectation of the period that “babes” began as readers with knowledge of the alphabet. Armed with the letters of the alphabet from the hornbook, children encountered other early forms of reading materials.

The child’s alphabet book is considered one of the oldest literary genres of American literature.

===Battledores===
The battledore was an instrument like a small racket, used for playing badminton.  The term was applied to the wooden or cardboard tablets, which gradually replaced the hornbook as a device for teaching children to read.  The wording printed on them varied greatly, but usually featured an alphabet, and, unlike the hornbook, entertainment was provided as well as instruction in the form of illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupui.edu/~engwft/battledore.htm Indiana University-battledores]&lt;/ref&gt; They first appeared in the 1750s and were produced until the middle of the nineteenth century. The battledore was a more complex type of horn book printed on thick paper folded in three parts containing enlarged text with word to object illustrations for each of the capital letters bordering the four sides. The letter-word associations provide insight into eighteenth century religious and sociocultural priorities.

:A is represented by an image of an   Angel
:J                                    Judge
:K                                    King
:M                                    Mitre (religious Head wear)
:Q                                    Queen
:T                                    Turk
:X                                    Xerxes
:Z                                    Zeal (kneeling figure with open prayer book)

Tuer's ''Royal Battledore'' illustrated the lower case alphabet letters with a for Apple; j, k, q, and x for Judge, King, Queen and Xerxes; m for Mouse and z for Zany jester. In fact, some battledores' upper and lower borders contained this rhyme:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:  He that ne'er learns his ABC,
:  For ever will a Blockhead be.
:  But he that learns these Letters fair,
:  Shall have a Coach to take the Air.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There is evidence of a gradual shift to more secular topics for general reading instruction from predominantly religious material.

===Primers and spellers===
{{Main|Primer (textbook)}}
Experienced with both hornbooks and battledores, children graduated on to the modern concept of a small book, multiple paper pages covered with a thick, protective layer. Early reading booklets or religious primers contained both the alphabet and increasingly complicated lists of alphabetized syllables along with selected excerpts from the Bible. From tablet to booklet, the ABC format served as the most common framework for additional reading materials. The first church primers paralleled the introduction of school textbooks known as “the ABC”.&lt;ref name=smith7&gt;Smith, N. B. (2002). American reading instruction. Newark, DE: International Reading Association. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Both colonial primers and ABC spellers employed the alphabet as an organizational feature for literacy instruction and spiritual study.

Originally imported from England, children’s reading textbooks aligned with the educational emphasis on the alphabet. While students were first trained to recite the alphabet, moralistic readings were framed around the letters of the alphabet. During the American colonial period the more secular “ABC” spellers quickly fell out of favor in comparison with the more religious primers; nevertheless, the alphabet remained the most systematic means of ordering the written contents of schoolbooks.

====The New England Primer====
Dating back to 1683, the ''[[New England Primer]]'' contained rhyming couplets for each letter of the alphabet. These patterned rhymes were often supported by gloomy woodcut illustrations. The content of these paired lines varied from overwhelmingly religious to somewhat secular depending upon the particular version of the New England Primer.

The standard ''Primer'' beginning 'In [[Adam]]'s fall, we sinned all' remained consistent throughout the numerous published texts; however, rhymes were occasionally edited for religious or political purposes, as demonstrated by the 1729 edition of the New England Primer. The passage, ‘our KING the good, No man of blood’ illustrated the letter K&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, N. B. (2002). American reading instruction. Newark, DE: International Reading Association. p. 21-2&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the conflict with the English monarchy, The K couplet was altered and appeared in the revised 1777 edition as ‘Proud [[Korah]]'s troop, was swallowed up.’&lt;ref name=ed1777&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/nep/1777/index.htm New England Primer 1777 ed. online]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the same 1777 version, 'The dog will bite, a thief at night' was replaced by a Biblical reference. 'The deluge drowned the earth around’ was inserted for ‘the watchful dog’. Referring to [[mortal sin]], the original U for '[[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]]'s beauteous wife made David seek his life’ was censored by omitting U and skipping to V. The alphabet letters were used to teach the moral code aspired by society and religion.

In the ''New England Primer'', the couplets were followed by alphabetized Biblical sentences; the “Alphabet of Lessons for Youth” was designed for further reading practice and lifelong moral instruction.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Both the 1777 and 1843 editions of the Primer maintained the same sentence excerpts from the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/nep/1777/index.htm|title=The New England Primer, 1777 edition|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.johansens.us/sane/education/primer.htm|title=The New England Primer - Island of Sanity|website=www.johansens.us|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are a few examples highlighting letters A, D, K and U:

: A Wise son maketh a glad father, but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
: DO not the abominable thing which I hate saith the Lord.
: KEEP thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.
: UPON the wicked, God shall rain an horrible tempest.

Clearly, the immensely popular ''New England Primer'' continued to influence educational practice even beyond the revolutionary period. Of parallel longevity, the battledore continued to be published well into the 18th century. Believed to be the inventor of battledores in 1746, Benjamin Collins actually printed 100,000 copies between 1771 and 1780&lt;ref&gt;(Osborne Collection of Early Children's Books, 1566-1910: a Catalogue, Toronto, Toronto Public Library, 1975, p. 109)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versions of The Child’s New Plaything===

Exemplifying the move away from strictly religious texts to more moral works, an outstanding example of the next generation of readers was the 1742 version of ''The Child’s New Plaything''. Sensitive to a youthful audience, the anonymous author introduced the alphabet with a lettered story about an appetizing apple pie.
{{div col}}
:A	Apple-Pye.
:B	bit it.
:C	cut it.
:D	divided it.
:E	eat it.
:F	fought for it.
:G	got it.
:H	had it.
:I      it'd it.
:J	join’d for’t.
:K	kept it.
:L	long’d for’t.
:M 	mourn’d for’t.
:N	nodded at it.
:O	open’d it.
:P	peep’d in’t.
:Q	quarter’d it.
:R	run for’t.
:S	snatch’d it.
:T	turn’d it.
:U     use'd it.
:V	view’d it.
:W	what'd it.
:X     excite'd it.
:Y     you'd it.
:Z     zone it.
&amp;
I wish I had a Piece of it now in my Hand.&lt;ref name=monaghan&gt;Monaghan, E. J. (2005). Learning to read and write in colonial America. Amhurst, MA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]]. p. 315)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{div col end}}
Later versions of the rhyme, now known as the [[Apple Pie ABC]], became more elaborate and diversified.

In addition, ''The Child’s New Plaything'' contained the alphabet story, ''A was an Archer'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110725175317/http://library.sfsu.edu/about/collections/images/alphabetbook.JPG www.library.sfsu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; which was also to go through many later editions.

==Present==

Today there are many diverse kinds of alphabet books that captivate a reader’s interest through [[alliteration]], [[onomatopoeia]], creative [[narrative]]s, [[poetry]] of all kinds, clever three-dimensional [[illusion]]s, mysterious visual [[treasure hunt]]s, [[humor]], and curiosity. Electronic alphabet books are now on the market, with various animations and audio features. However, educators have criticised alphabet books for focusing on teaching the names of the letters, which often sound different from the sounds they produce, as interfering with the process of learning to read.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Ann Sheppard Mounsey''', or '''Ann Mounsey Bartholomew''' on marriage (1811–1891), was born on 17 April 1811 at 21 Old Compton Street, Soho, London, the eldest child of Thomas Mounsey, a licensed victualler, and his wife, Mary, née Briggs.  She was a pianist, [[organ (music)|organ]]ist and composer. She studied with [[Johann Bernhard Logier]]. After 1828 she became the organist at various London churches, serving at [[St Vedast Foster Lane]] for nearly fifty years. She also performed at concerts and as an accompanist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pandora guide to women composers: Britain and the United States|author=Fuller, Sophie|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845 she performed as accompanist at the premiere of ''[[Hear My Prayer]]'', the [[anthem]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn]] for soprano solo, chorus and organ, and in 1853 married its librettist, [[William Bartholomew (writer)|William Bartholomew]] (1793–1867). After her marriage she taught music in London and worked as a composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The American History and Encyclopedia of Music|author=Hubbard, W.L.|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbxEWUzk2VkC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Ann+Mounsey+(1811%E2%80%931891)&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4NEnTZ_pIYL48AbOpvyZAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ann%20Mounsey%20(1811%E2%80%931891)&amp;f=false|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartholomew composed a large number of songs, part-songs, hymns and works for piano and organ. Selected compositions include:
*''The Nativity'', [[oratorio]]
*''Supplication and Thanksgiving'', sacred [[cantata]]
*''Sacred Harmony'', collection of sacred works

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5557">'''Charles Franklin Montgomery''' (1910&amp;ndash;1978) was an American art connoisseur, teacher, and scholar.

==Professional life==
After graduating from [[Harvard University]] in 1932, Montgomery worked for the ''Herald Tribune'', owned an orchard, and began collecting antiquities. His work as a dealer and consultant grew into a significant scholarly career.&lt;ref&gt;Wendell D. Garrett, "Charles Franklin Montgomery," ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'' Vol. 8, Pt. 1, April 1978, http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44517602.pdf (accessed 15 January 2015), 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery had a particular interest in pewter, a subject on which he was an authority and "enthusiastic evangelist."&lt;ref&gt;John D. Davis, ''Pewter at Colonial Williamsburg'' (Williamsburg, Va.: The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, 2003), xi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=b9Jdvv77YY0C&amp;pg=PP17&amp;lpg=PP17&amp;dq=%22charles+f+montgomery%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KFQfs7WPLf&amp;sig=OAPwRlPG5Frs3LTccC1N1G6OlI8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VA7mVNnXFMXlsASPnIDgCg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBTgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22charles%20f%20montgomery%22&amp;f=false Google Books] (accessed 19 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; His well-illustrated 1973 book, ''A History of American Pewter'', serves as a concise introduction to the subject, but also touches upon broader themes in the study of decorative arts and social history.&lt;ref&gt;Dean A. Fales, Jr., Review of ''A History of American Pewter'', ''The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' Vol. 98, No. 3 (July 1974), 386-388, https://www.jstor.org/stable/20090876 (accessed 19 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Montgomery was appointed associate curator and executive secretary of the [[Henry Francis Du Pont]] [[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library|Winterthur Museum]]; in 1954, he was appointed director of the Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Franklin Montgomery Papers, 1947-1974, The Frick Collection, http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord2.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=7419 (accessed 3 December 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Schlereth, Introduction to Charles F. Montgomery, "The Connoisseurship of Artifacts," in ''Material Culture Studies in America'', ed. Thomas J. Schlereth (Nashville, Tenn.: The American Association for State and Local History, 1982), 143-145.&lt;/ref&gt; He began teaching courses in the Winterthur Program in Early American Culture in 1952 and during the early years of the program was responsible for raising funds for fellowship grants. He remained part of the program until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Montgomery's direction, the Winterthur's graduate program was the first to offer professional training for careers in historic administration and historic house museums.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick H. Butler III, "Past, Present, and Future: The Place of the House Museum in the Museum Community," in ''Interpreting Historic House Museums'', Jessica Foy Donnelly, ed., (Walnut Creek, Calif.: AltaMira Press, 2002), 31, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8jtVpiC4jEMC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=%22charles+f+montgomery%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lzsTWl4ZoU&amp;sig=cYR3fYo0-fprVz7v_Iq0M6jtsww&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hQ7mVO6JE6_LsASQjoHQCA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwADgy#v=onepage&amp;q=%22charles%20f%20montgomery%22&amp;f=false Google Books] (accessed 19 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery then served as curator and Professor of Art History at [[Yale University]], where his exhibitions included "American Art, 1750-1800: Towards Independence," a bicentennial exhibit that later traveled to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery was a member of the editorial board of the ''American Walpole Society Notebook''.&lt;ref&gt;Schlereth, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[Walpole Society]] (1955) and the [[American Antiquarian Society]] (1958).&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Decorative Arts Society offers an Award and Prize, named for Montgomery, that honor outstanding scholarly work on the decorative arts.&lt;ref&gt;"Awards," Decorative Arts Society website, http://www.decartssociety.org/awards_smith.1.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318060510/http://www.decartssociety.org/awards_smith.1.html# |date=2015-03-18 }} (accessed 19 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Yale's History of Art Department includes a decorative arts professorship named for Montgomery.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Cooke, Jr., faculty page, Yale University Department of the History of Art, http://arthistory.yale.edu/faculty/faculty/faculty_cooke.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228150223/http://arthistory.yale.edu/faculty/faculty/faculty_cooke.html# |date=2015-02-28 }} (accessed 19 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Montgomery and his first wife, Evelyn Reed, spent the better part of a decade in Connecticut, attempting with little success to run an orchard. Montgomery's second wife and professional collaborator, [[Florence M. Montgomery]], served as Winterthur's curator of textiles and a textile consultant for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Montgomery had a son from each marriage; he and his second wife also had a daughter who died as a child. Montgomery died shortly after collapsing in a Yale classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, 26-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==   Primary Certifications   ==

===Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCENT)===

{{main|Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician}}
Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician represents the lowest level of certification which covers basic networking knowledge. Until its introduction, CCNA represented the first level of the certification program. It has appropriate use for an entry-level network support position. CCENT certified staff can install, manage and troubleshoot a small enterprise network, including basic network security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=David |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/data-center/four-reasons-to-earn-ciscos-new-ccent-certification/ |title=Four Reasons to Earn ciscos new CCENT Certification |publisher=Blogs.techrepublic.com |date=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step towards a CCNA certification must start by having a CCENT.

In 2017, Cisco introduced new ICND1 and ICND2 exams (needed for the new CCNA Routing and Switching). ICND1: 100-105 (Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices Part 1 v3.0) became the new exam required for CCENT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dipali|first1=R|title=CCENT|url=http://www.certiology.com/cisco-certifications/ccent.html|accessdate=10 November 2015|agency=certiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this change, CCENT became a sufficient pre-requirement for CCNA Security, CCNA Voice and CCNA Wireless.

Exam Blueprints can be found here: https://learningcontent.cisco.com/cln_storage/text/cln/marketing/exam-topics/100-105-icnd1-v3.pdf

Valid for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/entry/ccent.html|title=CCENT|website=Cisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cisco Certified Technicians (CCT)===

Cisco Certified Technicians have the skills to diagnose, restore, repair, and replace critical Cisco networking and system devices at customer sites. Technicians work closely with the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to quickly and efficiently resolve support incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Worldwide |url=http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le41/CCT/data_center/learning_certification_type_home_extra_level.html |title=CCT Data Center Certification - CCT Data Center Certification - Cisco Systems |publisher=Cisco.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2017, there were 2 domains available for CCT certification:
* CCT Routing and Switching - valid for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/entry/technician-cct/routing-switching.html|title=CCT Routing &amp; Switching|website=Cisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CCT Data Center - valid for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/entry/technician-cct/data-center.html|title=CCT Data Center|website=Cisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associate Certifications===

====CCNA Routing and Switching====
{{main|CCNA}}
The [[CCNA Routing and Switching]] certification covers skills necessary to administer devices on small or medium-sized networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PC World (magazine)|PCWorld]] Business Center|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/209227/it_certifications_that_matter.html|title=IT Certifications That Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This certification requires the ICND1 100-105 and ICND2 200-105 exams. Examinees may take the exams separately or the composite 200-125 CCNA exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Worldwide |url=http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/certifications/associate/ccna/index.html |title=CCNA Routing and Switching |publisher=Cisco.com |date=2013-09-01 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exists generally as a prerequisite to more advanced certifications, such as the CCNP exams and Cisco Design certifications, e.g. CCNP, CCDA, CCDP, etc.

[[Pearson VUE]] test centers conduct these exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le11/learning_about_registering_for_exams.html|title=About Registering for Exams|publisher=Cisco Systems, Inc.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910123617/http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le11/learning_about_registering_for_exams.html|archivedate=2011-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All CCNA-certified individuals specialize by technology. Previously, specialized tracks required passing and maintaining a CCNA certification, but with the expiration of the 640 series tests this is no longer the case.  As of autumn 2015, all CCNA Certifications have no prerequisites.

Valid for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna-routing-switching.html|title=CCNA Routing and Switching|website=Cisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CCDA====
Cisco-Certified Design Associate (CCDA) certified engineers can design switched or routed networks of LANs, WANs and broadband services.

===Expert-level Certifications===
{{main|CCIE Certification}}
Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert represents Cisco's highest certification, comprising seven tracks at present, tracks are updated and retired frequently and are aligned to industry's latest technologies and trends. As of October 6, 2010, 25,810 people held active CCIE Certifications.&lt;ref name=ccie&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/ccie/certified_ccies/worldwide.html CCIE's Worldwide] - A breakdown of CCIE qualified engineers around the world&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://certification.about.com/od/ciscocertification/a/morris_intvw.htm |title=Cisco Certification - Worth of Cisco Certification |publisher=Certification.about.com |date=2012-05-03 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/ccie/employers Most respected certification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318023500/http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/ccie/employers/ |date=2007-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''CertMag'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.certmag.com/articles/templates/cmag_feature.asp?articleid=487 CertMag certification survey, 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625161343/http://www.certmag.com/articles/templates/cmag_feature.asp?articleid=487 |date=2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; voted it as the most technically advanced IT certification and statistics generally report it as the highest salaried certification in IT salary surveys.

CCIE began in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/1993/corp_092793.html Cisco 1993 Press Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030701105037/http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/1993/corp_092793.html |date=2003-07-01 }} Cisco press release announcing CCIE&lt;/ref&gt; originally with a two-day lab, later changing to a one-day format. Fewer than 3% of Cisco-certified individuals attain CCIE certification and, on average, spend thousands of dollars and 18 months studying before passing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/ccie/employers Cisco CCIE general facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318023500/http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/ccie/employers/ |date=2007-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many candidates build training labs at home using old equipment, then sell it to other candidates after passing. Alternatively, candidates may rent "rack time" online. The CCIE consists of a written exam and a "lab" exam (in each track). The written exam acts as a prerequisite of the lab exam and has a cost of $400 per attempt. The written exam consists of 100 questions that must be completed within 2 hours. Upon passing the written exam, the candidate has eighteen months to take the lab exam. The candidate has three years after passing the written exam to successfully complete the lab. The lab is an eight-hour, hands-on exam designed to demonstrate that the candidate knows Internetworking theory and demonstrates advanced hands-on mastery. Candidates that do not pass the CCIE lab in that interval must re-pass the written exam before again attempting the CCIE lab exam. The minimum waiting time between attempts is one month.

As of July 2014, the CCIE Lab costs $1600 per attempt and ten Cisco locations offer it worldwide. Some of these locations do not offer all CCIE tracks. According to a Cisco survey, $9050 represents the average cost to prepare for CCIE certification as of April 2006, which gets spent mostly on practice equipment and study material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/ccie/downloads/results_survey__2006.pdf Cisco 2006 CCIE Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123091548/http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/ccie/downloads/results_survey__2006.pdf |date=2007-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No formal prerequisites currently exist for the CCIE written exam, but Cisco recommends at least 3–5 years networking experience. CCIE exists as the first ''Cisco Certified'' qualification and no other Certifications have existed previously. The associate and professional Certifications recognized the fact that CCIE is overkill for many networking personnel. Cisco has chosen not to make lower level Certifications prerequisites for the CCIE certification.

One may have the knowledge to hold multiple CCIE Certifications. As of September 9, 2008, 1,729 individuals held multiple CCIE Certifications. Of those, 274 hold three or more CCIE Certifications.&lt;ref name=employerinfo&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/ccie/employers/index.html Employer Information:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104201928/http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/ccie/employers/index.html |date=2007-01-04 }} What CCIE certification stands for; Why you should hire a CCIE; Why you don't want to lose a CCIE from your staff.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam McCombs cited this qualification as "essentially a PhD in the internet" in Season 1 Episode 10 of Shark Tank.

Upon successful completion of the lab exam, Cisco awards a CCIE number to a new CCIE. The first CCIE number allocated (in 1993) started at 1,024 and increased thereafter. As of August 2011, the highest CCIE number allocated reached just over 30,000. The first number they allocated to the first CCIE lab location, rather than to an individual, and featured as a plaque at the entrance to the lab. They awarded Number 1025 to Stuart Biggs, who created the first written exam and first lab exam. The first person to pass both CCIE written and lab exams, known as Terry Slattery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netcraftsmen.net/about-us/bios/327-terry-slattery.html|title=Our Team - NetCraftsmen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consulted at Cisco when the lab began development. Slattery held the first CCIE who did not work for Cisco.&lt;ref name=FirstCCIEs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/taxonomy/term/26?page=2|title=VoIP news, trend analysis and opinion|website=Network World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CCIEHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105151745/http://connection.netcordia.com/blogs/terrys_blog/archive/2007/08/16/ccie-test-and-numbering.aspx|title=CCIE test and numbering - Terry's Blog|date=5 November 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each CCIE retains their number regardless of how many Certifications he or she receives. Every two years a CCIE has to take a written test to retain the certification. If not done, the certification becomes suspended. After one further year without passing, the certification becomes revoked. One can then only regain the certification by starting from scratch. Re-certification can occur up to 2 years before the expiration date. After certification/re-certification, a CCIE must wait 6 months before re-certifying.

CCIE Lab Exams are administered only at special CCIE Lab Test Centers around the world. However, all the tracks for testing may not be available at a lab location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Take Your Lab Exam|url=https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccie_routing_switching/lab_exam_v5?tab=take-your-lab-exam|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CCAr ====
The Cisco Certified Architect (CCAr) certification assesses the experience and competency of [[network planning and design|network designers]] who can support the increasingly complex networks of global organizations and effectively translate business strategies into technical strategies.&lt;ref name=cca&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=5001913|title=Cisco Raises the Bar with Highest-Level IT Networking Certification: Cisco Certified Architect|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cisco.hosted.jivesoftware.com/community/certifications/cisco_certified_architect/syllabus|title=Cisco Learning Network Mobile Architect syllabus|publisher=Cisco.hosted.jivesoftware.com|date=|accessdate=2012-07-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103213455/http://cisco.hosted.jivesoftware.com/community/certifications/cisco_certified_architect/syllabus|archivedate=2013-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cisco Certified Architect certification is administered as a board exam. Candidates propose and defend an architecture solution to a set of business requirements. Candidates are asked to modify their proposals "on the fly," based on additional requirements presented by the board. Prerequisites include a CCDE certification, approximately 10 years of industry experience, and acceptance into the program via an application process.

Responsibilities of the Cisco Certified Architect:
* Lead creation and evolution of enterprise architecture
* Analyze technology and industry market trends
* Establish governing principles for Enterprise networks
* Selection of technology and products
* Identification of organization resource needs
* Lead the development of communication and education plan for enterprise network architecture

====CCIE Routing and Switching====
Routing and Switching seem by far the most popular track, with 35,272 worldwide certified individuals as of May 18, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/ccie/certified_ccies/worldwide.html|title=Certifications - Training &amp; Certifications|website=Cisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification covers a variety of networking concepts and protocols.

====CCDE====
CCDE runs in parallel with the more established CCIE program, in some areas providing a higher skill-set than CCIE. Specifically, CCDE identifies network professionals who have expert network design skills. Network design translates business requirements into end-to-end network designs and a solutions approach to network expansion and integration.&lt;ref&gt;Designing a Better Career. Cisco CCDE Expert Level Certification. Datasheet DDM08CS1607 10/08&lt;/ref&gt; CCDE focuses on network architecture and does not cover implementation and operations. CCDE supplies a vendor-neutral curriculum, testing business requirements analysis, design, planning, and validation practices.&lt;ref&gt;(d-5333) CCDE Practical Exam Topics v2.0 26-Sep-2011&lt;/ref&gt; The course came about because employers needed a way to identify experienced network designers and architects who could address all aspects of existing and new networking technologies and trends.&lt;ref&gt;Cisco Certified Design Expert (CCDE) Certification FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). Version 2. CCDE FAQ v2.doc&lt;/ref&gt; While engineers (including many CCIEs) had fulfilled this role, certification had not advanced beyond the CCDP certification. CCDE numbering adopts a different format than CCIE and appears split into a year and number within that year. It uses the same CCIE tools to verify qualified status. CCDE certified individuals can use CCIE qualification exams to re-certify and vice versa. CCDE provides advanced network infrastructure design principles and fundamentals for large networks. A CCDE can demonstrate an ability to develop solutions which address planning, design, integration, optimization, operations, security, and ongoing support focused at the infrastructure level.

====CCIE Collaboration====
The Voice track covers advanced topics in subjects such as Quality of Service, [[Media Gateway Control Protocol|MGCP]], [[Call Manager]] (Cisco's [[VoIP]] [[Private branch exchange|PBX]]), [[Cisco Unity Connection]] (Cisco's [[Voice Messaging]] platform), Unity Express, Unified Contact Center Express, Cisco Unified Presence Server, Cisco's HWIC-4ESW, and the 3750-24PS. Only 802 CCIE Voice certified engineers hold current certificates as of September 9, 2008. Most candidates pass after three or four lab attempts, but some have required more than six. Many have reputed that the lab exam seems as much a test of time management and planning as of technical expertise. The widely dissimilar platforms used sets the Voice lab exam apart from other CCIE lab exams. One must make configurations on the [[Windows 2003 Server]] environment, a CallManager web-based GUI, and the IOS command line. As such, it involves a lot of back-and-forth fine tuning between the numerous platforms.

In May 2013, Cisco announced it will retire the CCIE Voice track and introduce the new CCIE Collaboration track, including new topics such as virtualization, Jabber instant messaging and video. After protest from current and aspirant CCIE Voice holders, whom argued that the differences remain too few to warrant retiring the track with no option to transition to the new track, Cisco offered a transition path for existing Voice holders. The Collaboration written exam may have availability starting from November 21, 2013. The lab exam will transition from Voice to Collaboration on February 14, 2014.

====CCIE Data Center====
Cisco has announced the September availability of a CCIE Data Center certification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learningnetwork.cisco.com/docs/DOC-13979 |title=Cisco Learning Network Mobile Document|publisher=Learningnetwork.cisco.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which certifies the expert-level skills required to plan, prepare, operate, monitor, and troubleshoot complex data center networks. The CCIE Data Center written exam will be available Sept. 3, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccie_data_center/written_exam |title=Cisco Learning Network Mobile Written Exam |publisher=Learningnetwork.cisco.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lab exam should have availability in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learningnetwork.cisco.com/docs/DOC-14003 |title=Cisco Learning Network Mobile Documents|publisher=Learningnetwork.cisco.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CCIE Security====
The Security track covers advanced topics in subjects such as [[Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances|ASA]], FirePower, [[Cisco IOS|IOS]] security, Wireless Security, Content Security, Antimalware Protection and many others.

====CCIE Service Provider====
The Cisco CCIE Service Provider (CCIE SP) certification validates expert level skills required of a Network Engineer to configure, build, troubleshoot, and optimize a complex highly available Service Provider IP NGN core infrastructure. Candidates preparing for CCIE SP certification possess thorough knowledge in IP core, aggregation/edge, and remote access technologies, Layer 2 and 3 VPNs, plus managed services traversing an IP core network.

====CCIE Wireless====
Candidates who pass the CCIE Wireless certification exams demonstrate broad theoretical knowledge of wireless networking and a solid understanding of wireless local area networking (WLAN) technologies from Cisco.

==Specialist Certifications==
In addition to the vast amount of Certifications above, Cisco also provides Specialist Certifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Specialist Certifications|url=http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/certifications/specialist/index.html|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The exams for these Certifications are often focused on some specific technology and generally targeted at members of the Cisco Partner Program, including those selling, designing, or supporting Cisco products and services. By combining various exams, a Cisco partner can gain specialty status and thus qualify for additional partner benefits.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert/ccie-program/emeritus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialisations can be held at Express, Advanced and Master levels, reflecting the depth of a partners skills across certain technologies and architectures, and can be held in both a Technology portfolio, or an architecture. Specialisations are:&lt;ref name=Certifications /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/digital-transformation-specialist/business/value-specialist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive deficit''' or '''cognitive impairment''' is an inclusive term to describe any characteristic that acts as a barrier to [[cognition|the cognition process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coren |first=Stanley |author2=Lawrence M. Ward |author3=James T. Enns  |title=Sensation and Perception |publisher=[[Harcourt Brace]] |year=1999 |page=9 |isbn= 0-470-00226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term may describe
* deficits in overall [[intelligence]] (as with [[intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]]),
* specific and restricted deficits in cognitive abilities (such as in [[learning disability|learning disorders]] like [[dyslexia]]),
* [[Neuropsychological assessment|neuropsychological deficits]] (such as in [[attention]], [[working memory]] or [[Executive functions|executive function]]),
* or it may describe drug-induced impairment in cognition and memory (such as that seen with [[alcohol]], [[glucocorticoids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11461709 | volume=35 | title=Corticosteroids and cognition. | journal=J Psychiatr Res | pages=127–45 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3956(01)00018-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[benzodiazepine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kalachnik | first1 = JE. | last2 = Hanzel | first2 = TE. | last3 = Sevenich | first3 = R. | last4 = Harder | first4 = SR. | title = Benzodiazepine behavioral side effects: review and implications for individuals with mental retardation | journal = Am J Ment Retard | volume = 107 | issue = 5 | pages = 376–410 |date=Sep 2002 | pmid = 12186578 | doi = 10.1352/0895-8017(2002)107&lt;0376:BBSERA&gt;2.0.CO;2| issn = 0895-8017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
It usually refers to a durable characteristic, as opposed to [[altered level of consciousness]], which may be acute and reversible. Cognitive deficits may be [[Congenital disorder|inborn]] or caused by environmental factors such as [[acquired brain injury|brain injuries]], [[neurological disorders]], or [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hockenbury, Don and Sandy | title=Discovering Psychology | publisher=Worth Publishers | year=2004 | isbn=0-7167-5704-4}}{{page needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Fried, Yehuda  |author2=Joseph Agassi, | title=Paranoia: A Study in Diagnosis| publisher=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, 50 | year=1976 | isbn=90-277-0704-9}}{{page needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Older people with cognitive impairment appear to improve somewhat with [[light therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiu|first1=HL|last2=Chan|first2=PT|last3=Chu|first3=H|last4=Hsiao|first4=SS|last5=Liu|first5=D|last6=Lin|first6=CH|last7=Chou|first7=KR|title=Effectiveness of Light Therapy in Cognitively Impaired Persons: A Metaanalysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=October 2017|volume=65|issue=10|pages=2227-2234|doi=10.1111/jgs.14990|pmid=28734045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case studies ==

{{Cleanup|section|reason=most of these examples are longitudinal studies with large samples, not case studies|date=December 2015}}

There is evidence to indicate that parallel age trends have been similar over a vast amount of time, as with Schaie’s Seattle Longitudinal Study, which contained fifty years worth of data  as well as seventy years in Wechsler tests. Studies such as these{{Example needed}} have demonstrated the different patterns in age trends have two specific patterns in cognition, a constant decrease in measures of processing abilities such as reasoning, and stability followed by a steady decline for knowledge previously acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gualtieri|first=C. Thomas|author2=Johnson, Lynda G.|title=Age-related cognitive decline in patients with mood disorders|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry|volume=32|issue=4|pages=962–967|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2007.12.030|pmid=18243461|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A twelve-year study published in 2012 researched the effects of lifestyle activities on cognitive deficit in the hopes that a long study such as this could, to some degree, help older adults to ward off cognitive decline. The study looked at verbal speed, episodic memory, and semantic memory to be influenced by physical, social, and cognitive activities. The results of the study concluded that maintenance of cognitive functions with normal aging can be maintained by keeping an active lifestyle. The results also seemed to conclude that the correlation between lifestyle activities and cognition is not a simple one, as not all cognitive abilities were related to changes in the daily activities. Therefore, further research of longitudinal design observing the matches between activities and cognitive abilities in cognitively impaired adults could be critical.&lt;ref name="Small 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=B|author2=Dixon R|author3=McArdle J|author4=Grimm K.|title=Do changes in lifestyle engagement moderate cognitive decline in normal aging? Evidence from the Victoria Longitudinal Study|journal=Neuropsychology|date=March 2012|volume=26|issue=2|pages=144–155|doi=10.1037/a0026579|pmid=22149165|pmc=3761970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies using brain imaging have been done in an attempt to note early signs of cognitive decline on healthy individuals before changes noticed clinically occur. In this way the study attempted to find more biomarkers for early onset of degenerative diseases.  The results from the study concluded that there are indeed patterns of brain abnormality that can be associated with brain decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=VH|author2=Resnick SM|author3=Doshi J|author4=Beason-Held LL|author5=Zhou Y|author6=Ferrucci L|author7=Wong DF|author8=Kraut MA|author9=Davatzikos C|title=Longitudinal imaging pattern analysis (SPARE-CD index) detects early structural and functional changes before cognitive decline in healthy older adults|journal=Neurobiology of Aging|volume=33|issue=12|pages=2733–45|doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.01.010|pmid=22365049|pmc=4023476|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-sectional study, researchers investigated patients with mood disorders in comparison with a control group to see if there was a difference on the effect of aging between the groups. These patients were tested with the Central Nervous System Vital Signs, a neurocognitive battery test. The study examined subjects from ages 18 to 90, noticing a sharp decline in the patients with mood disorder compared to the normal group when subjects were ages 65 and up. These declines were observed in the cognitive areas of attention, executive function, processing speed, and memory.&lt;ref name="Small 2012" /&gt;

== Other findings ==

Although one would expect cognitive decline to have major effects on [[job performance]], it seems that there is little to no correlation of health with job performance.  With the exception of cognitive-dependent jobs such as air-traffic controller, professional athlete, or other elite jobs, age does not seem to impact one’s job performance. This obviously conflicts with cognitive tests given, so the matter has been researched further.
One possible reason for this conclusion is the rare need for a person to perform at their maximum. There is a difference between typical functioning, that is&amp;nbsp;– the normal level of functioning for daily life, and maximal functioning, that is&amp;nbsp;– what cognitive tests observe as our maximum level of functioning. As the maximum cognitive ability that we are able to achieve decreases, it may not actually affect our daily lives, which only require the normal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salthouse|first=Timothy|title=Consequences of Age-Related Cognitive Declines|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=10 January 2012|volume=63|issue=1|pages=201–226|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100328|pmc=3632788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have indicated that childhood hunger might have a protective effect on cognitive decline. One possible explanation is that the onset of age-related changes in the body can be delayed by [[calorie restriction]]. Another possible explanation is the selective survival effect, as the study participants who had a childhood with hunger tend to be the healthiest of their era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barnes |first=L.

'''Connected learning''' is a type of learning that integrates personal interest, peer relationships, and achievement in academic, civic, or career-relevant areas.&lt;ref name="Itoetal"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dmlhub.net/sites/default/files/Connected_Learning_report.pdf|title=Connected learning: An agenda for research and design|last=Ito|first=M.|last2=Gutiérrez|first2=K.| last3=Livingstone

|first9=S.G.| date=2013|publisher=Digital Media and Learning Research Hub|location= Irvine, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, connected learning is an approach to educational reform keyed to the abundance of information and social connection brought about by networked and digital media. Advocates of connected learning posit that this approach leverages new media to broaden access to opportunity and meaningful learning experiences.&lt;ref name="Itoetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tcfir.org/whitepapers/Connected%20Learning%20Framework.pdf|title =Connected learning: A framework of observation, research and development to guide the reform of education|last=Cornwell|first=W. R. |last2=Cornwell|first2=J. R.|date=2006|publisher=The Center for Internet Research|location=Breckenridge, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connected learning model suggests that youth learn best when: they are interested in what they are learning; they have peers and mentors who share these interests; and their learning is directed toward opportunity and recognition.&lt;ref name="Itoetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell" /&gt; According to the proponents of connected learning, social support for interest-driven learning and connections to multiple sites of learning activity drive individual learning outcomes. These individual outcomes also lead to collective outcomes by building knowledge, capacity and expertise in diverse communities.&lt;ref name="Itoetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell" /&gt;  Environments that support connected learning are generally characterized as having a sense of shared purpose, a focus on production, and openly networked infrastructures.

== History ==
Connected learning has been a term used in research since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ajot.aotapress.net/content/45/11/1033|title=Clinical reasoning and new ideas on intelligence: Implications for teaching and learning|last=Schwartz|first=K. B.|work=American Journal of Occupational Therapy|date=1991|volume=45|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LundebergMoch"&gt;{{cite news|jstor=2943894|title=Influence of social interaction of cognition: Connected learning in Science|last=Lundeberg|first=M. A.|last2=Moch|first2=S. D.|work=The Journal of Higher Education|date=1995|volume=66|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original usages piggybacked on the concept of [[Women's development theory#Procedural Knowledge: Separate and connected knowing|connected knowing]],&lt;ref name=Belenkyetal&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Ways of Knowing|last=Belenky|first=M. F.|last2=Clinchy|first2=B. M.|last3=Goldberger|first3=N. R.|last4=Tarule|first4=J. M.|date=1986|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasized the importance of context in the development of knowledge for women. Many articles from this time used the term connected learning in reference to hands-on education like fieldwork&lt;ref name="LundebergMoch" /&gt; or internships which is tied to the concept of learning in context. The early research that used the term connected learning also shared the common theme of sociality being important to learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=Tinto&gt;{{cite news|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/review_of_higher_education/v021/21.2tinto.html|title=Colleges as communities: Taking research on student persistence seriously|last=Tinto|first=V.|work=The Review of Higher Education|date=1998|volume=21|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000, the term connected learning began to be used in research publications to refer variously to project-based, networked, social, and information-age learning.&lt;ref name="Vaz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ605181|title=Connected learning: Interdisciplinary projects in international settings|last=Vaz|first=R.

Cronwell and Cronwell created the first "framework and an organizing set of principles to guide educational research and development," (p.&amp;nbsp;17).&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell" /&gt; This research was supported by the Center for Internet Research. This connected learning framework is based on the following set of principles:
* The education process must become learner-centered.
* Assessment – diagnostic, formative, and summative – must be improved and deeply integrated into the learning and teaching process.
* National and state academic standards must be met or exceeded.
* Ethnic academic achievement "gaps" must be addressed and eliminated.
* Learning must become more active.
* The formation of lifelong learning behaviors must be facilitated.
* Education reform must be guided by empiricism.
* Well-designed, technology-enabled education reform will be self-improving, self-reforming and self-documenting.
* Teaching and learning content must be of the highest possible quality, current and relevant.
* Proven pedagogical methodologies and the best research from all field with a bearing on learning and teaching must be integrated into education.
* The needs of all stakeholders (students, teachers, parents, administration, government, business, etc.) must be served.
* Reform must also address the need to improve the formation and achievement of vocational goals by students.
* Where minimum standards exist, the goal must be near-universal mastery rather than a standard distribution of achievement. (pp.&amp;nbsp;19)&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell" /&gt;
This idea of connected learning is supposed to be an alternative to traditional in-school instruction. They label this connected learning framework as a work in progress that needs more research to support it. However, no further research has been completed on this framework.

== Examples ==
Examples of learning environments that integrate peer, interest, and academic pursuits including athletics programs that are tied to in-school recognition, certain arts and civic learning programs, and interest-driven academic programs such as math, chess, or robotics competitions. These connected learning environments embody values of equity, social belonging, and participation. Connected learning environments include a sense of shared purpose, a focus on production, and openly networked infrastructures.&lt;ref name="Itoetal" /&gt; Learning environments that embody principles of connected learning include:

== Reception ==
Connected learning since its recent ramp up has been well received from the global education community.&lt;ref name="YALSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalsa.ala.org/blog/2013/09/18/amplified-connected-learning-advocacy-the-2014-yalsa-presidents-program/|title= YALSA 2014 President’s Program on Connected Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Infographic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/search?q=connectedlearning.tv%2Finfographic&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime|title= Connectedlearning.tv/infographic twitter results}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whatisconnectedlearning"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/search?q=connectedlearning.tv%2Fwhat-is-connected-learning&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime |title= Connectedlearning.tv/what-is-connected-learning twitter results}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerstein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usergeneratededucation.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/connect-learning-a-new-research-driven-initiative/ |title= Connected learning: A new research-driven initiative|last=Gerstein|first=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachthought.com/culture/connected-learning-the-power-of-social-learning-models/|title= Connected learning: The power of social learning models | last=Heick|first=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EducatorsTechnology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educatorstechnology.com/2012/08/teachers-guide-to-21st-century-learning.html |title= Teachers guide to 21st century learning: Connected learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators and policymakers have raised concerns regarding the new model of learning laid out by research and practitioner groups, which included:
* Connected learning is "yet another buzz word for the corporatization of education."&lt;ref name="CollegeLevel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bedfordstmartins.com/bits/uncategorized/can-connected-learning-work-at-the-college-level/ |title=Can connected learning work at the college level?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Connected learning is devoid of critical thinking as it relies on "a formula for students getting what they already want to find . . . . . [rather than] broadening horizons to discover what is not already known."&lt;ref name="Threattoconnectedlearning"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalis.nwp.org/site-blog/threat-connected-learning/3698|title=The Threat to Connected Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The model gives no mention of key K-12 educators who have been pushing for similar types of networked/connected learning for the past decade.&lt;ref name="Whathavetheydone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2012/03/03/connected-learning-what-have-they-done-with-alec-will-vicki/
|title=Connected Learning: What have they done with Alec, Will, Vicki?
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased workload for those who support learners is also a concern&lt;ref name="7Things"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/7-things-you-should-know-about-connected-learning|title= 7 Things you should know about connected learning }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://clrn.dmlhub.net/ Connected Learning Research Network] chair [[Mizuko Ito|Mimi Ito]] responded to the criticism pointing out that, "the connected learning principles were developed with a very diverse range of practitioners in K-12 and other learning institutions like museums and libraries, as well as people working in popular culture/media, technology, and university researchers. So while the research network hopes to provide a research component to feed the broader connected learning effort, we are by no means the driving force behind it.”&lt;ref name="EducatorsTechnology" /&gt;

'''Course reserve''' is a term used in academic [[library|libraries]] to describe materials set aside for a specific academic course or other use.  Most often materials are put on course reserve by library staff at the request of the course's instructor. Materials on reserve typically have shorter loan periods than other library materials to allow access to a high volume of library patrons - for example, the students taking the course in question. Reserve materials usually return to normal circulation at the end of the term.

==E-Reserves==
Many academic libraries are installing [[software]] and supporting availability of course readings in digital formats through a service referred to as "E-reserves." The service provides controlled access to materials in a digital format but limited to students in a specific course. Such services are often connected to other classroom services for [[collaboration]] and [[course management]].

==Copyright==
Libraries often place excerpts from copyrighted works, in closed or electronic reserves, in accordance with the [[Fair Use]] guidelines, which govern formal classroom distribution of photocopied materials and extend to reserve readings as well.

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The system of education in Antigua &amp; Barbuda is based on the British educational system. The school year begins in September and ends in June of the following year. In order to ensure that all costs related to schooling are covered by the government, there is an education levy on all basic wages in Antigua and Barbuda, with the funds used toward such costs as supplies, transportation, and school infrastructure maintenance.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Primary education begins at the age of five years and normally lasts for seven years. Secondary education lasts for five years, with three years of lower secondary, followed by two years of upper secondary. In 2001, there were about 13,000 students enrolled at the primary schools and 5,000 students at the secondary schools. About 1,000 secondary school age students were enrolled in vocational programs. As of 2000 the primary pupil-teacher ratio was an estimated 19 to 1; the ratio for secondary school was about 13:1. The [[Government of Antigua and Barbuda|government]] administers the majority of the schools. In 2003, estimated spending on education was about 3.8% of the [[GDP]]. In 2000, about 38% of primary school students were enrolled in private schools.

On November 17, 2010, Longoria filed for divorce from Parker in Los Angeles, citing "irreconcilable differences".&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;Marikar, Sheila.[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/eva-longoria-files-divorce-tony-parker/story?id=12172329 "Eva Longoria Files for Divorce From Tony Parker"], ABCNews.com, November 17, 2010.

===Ancestry===
[[File:Eva Longoria Cannes 2.jpg|thumb|Longoria at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]]]]

According to research done in 2010 by [[Harvard]] professor and  ''[[Faces of America (PBS series)|Faces of America]]'' host [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], Longoria's oldest identifiable Spanish immigrant ancestor is her ninth great-grandfather, Lorenzo Suárez de Longoria (b. [[Oviedo]], 1592), who immigrated to the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (modern-day Mexico) in 1603. His family was based in a small village called Llongoria, [[Belmonte de Miranda|Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias]], Spain. [[Longoria]] is the Castellanized form of this Asturian-language surname.

In 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} of land along the [[Rio Grande]] in a land grant from King [[Charles III of Spain]]. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of the [[Mexican–American War]], the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the [[Mexican–American War]] and the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/eva-longoria/8/ "Faces of America: Eva Longoria"], PBS, ''[[Faces of America]]'' series, with Professor [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[DNA test]]ing, Longoria's overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27% Asian and [[Indigenous American|Indigenous]], and 3% [[Black people|African]].&lt;ref name="LM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/celebrity/faces-america-reveals-eva-longoria-parkers-surprising-roots|title="Faces of America" Reveals Eva Longoria Parker's Surprising Roots |last=Miller|first=Gerri|date=February 2, 2010|work=[[Latina (magazine)|Latina magazine]] |publisher= Latina Media Ventures LLC|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a computer compared the DNA results of Gates's dozen guests, tests showed that she is genetically related to cellist [[Yo-Yo Ma]], who is of Chinese heritage.&lt;ref name="LM"/&gt; Since women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Longoria did not inherit her father's [[Y-DNA]], but she did inherit her mother's [[mitochondrial DNA]] (genetic information passed from mother to child). Longoria's mtDNA belongs to the [[Haplogroup A (mtDNA)|Haplogroup A2]], making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, a [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] from the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Mayans on both sides of her family.&lt;ref name="Gate's book"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meYbj1E6Ki8C&amp;pg=PA245&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;dq=eva+longoria+is+mtdna+A2#v=onepage&amp;q=eva%20longoria%20is%20mtdna%20A2 |title=Faces of America: How 12 Extraordinary People Discovered their Pasts|pages=241–247 |last=Gates|first=Henry Louis Jr.|publisher=NYU Press|date= July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?ID=ENTEN20100137069&amp;keyword=hollywood&amp;subcatg=MOVIESWORLD |title=Eva Longoria shocked by DNA test |date=April 4, 2010 |work=NDTV Movies |publisher=NDTV Convergence Limited |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407224943/http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?ID=ENTEN20100137069&amp;keyword=hollywood&amp;subcatg=MOVIESWORLD |archivedate=April 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longoria identifies as a "Texican"—a Mexican-American Texan.&lt;ref name="Gate's book"/&gt;

'''FUNET''' is the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[NREN|University and Research Network]], a [[backbone network]] providing [[Internet]] connections for [[List_of_universities_in_Finland|Finnish universities]] and [[List of polytechnics in Finland|polytechnics]] as well as other research facilities. It is governed by the state-owned [[CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd]]. The FUNET project started in December 1983 and soon gained international connectivity via [[European Academic Research Network|EARN]] with [[DECnet]] as the dominant protocol. FUNET was connected to the greater Internet through [[NORDUnet]] in 1988. The FUNET [[FTP]] service went online in 1990, hosting the first versions of [[Linux]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csc.fi/english/institutions/funet/about/history Brief History of Funet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main backbone connections have gradually been upgraded to [[fiber-optic communication|optical fiber]] since 2008. First 100 Gbit/s connections were put on production in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/funet/History+of+Funet+in+brief History of Funet in brief]&lt;/ref&gt; FUNET is connected to other research networks through [[NORDUnet]], and to other Finnish [[Internet_Service_Provider|ISPs]] via three [[Finnish Communication and Internet Exchange|FICIX]] points.

The '''Fletcher Farm School''' is an arts and crafts school in [[Ludlow (town), Vermont|Ludlow, Vermont]], USA, operated by the non-profit Society of Vermont Artists and Craftsmen.
Courses are given on weekends in winter and spring, and during the summer. 
The school teaches a broad range of skills including fiber arts, woodworking, pottery, jewelry and photography.

==Location==

The school is on [[Vermont Route 103]] between Ludlow and [[Proctorsville, Vermont|Proctorsville]].{{sfn|Rogers|Rogers|2006|p=168}}
It lies in Vermont's beautiful [[Green Mountains]].{{sfn|Berman|2008|p=84}}
The property is at the east end of the village of Ludlow. It was settled in 1783 by Jesse Fletcher and Lucy Keyes. 
The first frame house they built is said to be the oldest in the town. In 1805 they built a larger addition. Both were still in use as of 2014. 
The property stayed in the family, and successive owners added buildings.{{sfn|History of the Fletcher Family...}}
These include barns and cabins where visitors can stay during summer courses.{{sfn|Rogers|Rogers|2006|p=168}}
At other times students can stay in Ludlow. The Society of Vermont Artists and Craftsmen runs a small arts-and-crafts store at the school in summer.{{sfn|Rogers|Rogers|2006|p=168}}

==School history==

[[Allen M. Fletcher]], a banker, was governor of Vermont in 1912–15. His widow and daughters gave the property to the [[YWCA]] in 1928 for use as a training school. The program did not succeed and in 1933 the YWCA returned the property to the Fletchers.
Later that year a non-profit educational foundation was formed named Fletcher Farm Inc.
It was given the property, including the buildings and about {{convert|400|acre}} of meadows and forest, on condition that the property should always by used for educational purposes. The original trustees included [[Dorothy Canfield Fisher]] and [[Robert Frost]].{{sfn|History of the Fletcher Family...}}

The school gave various adult education courses over the next fifteen years.{{sfn|History of the Fletcher Family...}}
For example, in the summer of 1934 [[Grace Coyle]] organized a two-week [[Social work with groups|group work]] institute for forty YWCA and settlement house workers at Fletcher Farm.{{sfn|Alissi|2008|p=16}}
In 1935 two theologians, [[Paul Tillich]] and [[Henry Nelson Wieman]], spent ten days at a religious retreat at Fletcher Farm. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] wrote his doctoral dissertion on the differences in the two men's views of God.{{sfn|Morrissey|1984|p=214}}

In 1948 the farmhouse, sugar house and barns were leased to the non-profit Society of Vermont Craftsmen.
They have operated the Fletcher Farm Craft School ever since.{{sfn|History of the Fletcher Family...}}
The noted weaver [[Berta Frey]] was an instructor at the Fletcher Farm School in the early years.{{sfn|Norris|1979|p=3}}
Irene Slater taught at the school in the 1950s, described as a "professional decorator, specializing in the reproduction of reverse painting of old clock and mirror glasses. Collector of original pieces."{{sfn|Clause|2012|p=185}}
Ronald Alfred Slayton taught summer courses at the school in the 1950s and 1960s, where he developed a naturalistic style of watercolor painting, rich in color.{{sfn|Duffy|Hand|Orth|2003|p=271}}
[[Joseph Skinger]] taught jewelry for several years at the school.{{sfn|Stead|2007}}

==Programs==

Students are generally mature adults.{{sfn|Berman|2008|p=84}}
Fees cover food and lodging, tuition and studio space.{{sfn|Rogers|Rogers|2006|p=168}}
The school offers the oldest and most respected crafts program in Vermont. Subjects have included off-loom weaving, wooden-spoon carving, quilting, pottery, bookbinding and gourd or birch-bark vessel design.{{sfn|Tree|Carter|2012|p=62}}
In 2014 the Winter/Spring classes included basketry, fiber arts, fine arts and photography, jewelry and lapidary.

== History ==
[[CEO]] [[Philip A. Cutler]] attended [[McGill University]]'s Faculty of Education from 2009-2013. During his time as a student he began an in-home tutoring service to supplement his income. Upon graduating, Cutler began his career as a sixth grade teacher.

During his time teaching, Cutler identified that many of his students were hiring private tutors to support their studies. The students who hired tutors were often the wealthiest ones, not the ones who needed the most assistance to succeed. This inequity led Cutler to leave the teaching profession and found GradeSlam with co-founder Roberto Cipriani, a [[neuroscientist]] from McGill University, in order to bridge the equity gap that was prevalent with students in his class.

In July 2016, GradeSlam announced that it raised $1.6 million from venture capitalists. The financing was led by Birchmere Ventures, with participation from [[Business Development Bank of Canada|BDC Capital]], Real Ventures and various angels, including Cutler himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GradeSlam raises $1.6 million seed round|url=http://www.montrealintechnology.com/gradeslam-raises-1-6-million/|website=Montrealintechnology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, GradeSlam announced the addition of former [[Google]] engineer Luis Serrano to their advisory board. Serrano is credited with building the [[Udacity]] NLP, AI and Data Science courses and is widely regarded as one of the top minds in [[Artificial Intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GradeSlam Adds Machine Learning Expert, Luis Serrano, to Advisory Board|url=https://blog.gradeslam.org/edtech-leader-gradeslam-adds-exgoogle-machine-learning-expert-luis-serrano-to-advisory-board/|website=GradeSlam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original foundation included a primary school, a teacher training college, a theological college, and a technical college to teach practical skills such as carpentry, bricklaying and printing. It also served as printer for the Blantyre Mission; producing religious texts, school textbooks, and government and other daily and weekly publications. Later, training in mechanical skills was added to the curriculum. In the late 1950s, a secondary school was opened.

HHI is said to have "played a most significant role in religious, educational, and political developments in Malawi".&lt;ref name=HDN /&gt;

The Institute now lies within the grounds of [[St Michael and All Angels Church, Blantyre]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40570">The history of '''[[Upper Canada College]]''' (UCC), located in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], began with its founding in 1829.

==Founding==
[[Image:1879uppercanadacollege.png|thumb|Drawing of former UCC campus at King and Simcoe Streets in downtown Toronto]]
Upper Canada College was founded in 1829 by then-[[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Upper Canada]], Major-General Sir [[John Colborne]] (later Lord Seaton), to serve as a feeder school to the newly established King's College (later the [[University of Toronto]]). It was modelled on the great public schools of Britain, most notably [[Eton College|Eton]].&lt;ref name="How"&gt;''Upper Canada College, 1829-1979: Colborne's Legacy''; Howard, Richard; Macmillan Company of Canada, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCCHist"&gt;[http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=7292 Upper Canada College: History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213084128/http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=7292 |date=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though now a private school, the college was created with public funds including an initial land grant of 6,000 acres of crown lands, later supplemented with an additional 60,000 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Centennial Story: The Board of Education for the City of Toronto 1850-1950|last=Hardy|first=Edwin Austin|publisher=Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons (Canada) Limited|year=1950|isbn=|editor-last=Cochrane|editor-first=Honora M.|location=Toronto, ON|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An announcement of the College's January opening appeared in the December 17, 1829, edition of the ''Canada Gazette'', and teaching at the College began on January 4, 1830, with 57 students; the first boy enrolled being [[Henry Scadding]].  By the end of the school's first semester, the enrolment had increased to 89.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;  By the end of the first year of operation, UCC had admitted 140 pupils and employed a principal and eight masters.&lt;ref name="UCCHist" /&gt;

Prior to 1829, the College was called the Royal Grammar School; its first permanent buildings stood on Russell Square, on land that is now bounded by [[King Street (Toronto)|King]], Simcoe, Adelaide and [[John Street (Toronto)|John]] Streets in downtown Toronto. Almost immediately after the College opened, plans were implemented for newer and more permanent buildings, and the 1831 school year began in new structures at the north-west corner of King and Simcoe Streets (now 212 King Street West).&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;
{{further|Architecture of Upper Canada College}}

The new school was praised by some; the Reverend Thomas Radcliffe stated in an 1833 letter: "Future generations will bless the memory of Sir John Colborne, who, to the many advantages derived from the equity and wisdom of his government, has added that of a magnificent foundation [in Upper Canada College] for the purposes of literary instruction. The lowest salary of any of the professors of this institution is £30 per annum, with the accommodation of a noble brick house and the privilege of taking boarders at £50 per annum."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldandsold.com/articles11/canada-education-3.shtml ''Education In Upper Canada From 1783 To 1844''; 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the costs of the new buildings, combined with the large staff and their high salaries, led to criticism of the College and its expenses.  In his publication ''Colonial Advocate'', [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] stated: "The College here at York in Upper Canada is most extravagantly endowed... thousands of pounds are realised at will by its self-constituted managers from the sale of school lots and school lands [in fact, not true]... splendid incomes given to masters... and dwellings furnished to the professors... by the sweat of the brow of the Canadian labourer."&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, William Lyon; ''Colonial Advocate'', May 19, 1831&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1837, UCC's student militia offered help to Sir [[Francis Bond Head]]'s [[Family Compact]] government in suppressing Mackenzie's pro-[[responsible government]] [[Upper Canada Rebellion]]. In 1852, Mackenzie's sons, William and George, were enrolled at UCC.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

==University control==
On March 4, 1837, the King's College charter was amended to take UCC in under the control of the university, with the principal to be appointed by the King, and the vice-principal and masters nominated by the Chancellor of King's College (the Lieutenant-Governor) at the approval of the King's College Council.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

In 1838, UCC was searching for a new principal and asked the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[William Howley]] for a suggestion. [[John McCaul]] was put forward. He accepted and took the post on 29 January 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mccaul_john_11E.html| last=Craig| first=G. M.| title=McCaul, John| journal=Dictionary of Canadian Biography| volume=11| date=1982| publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval| accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1842, [[Charles Dickens]] visited the College and said of it: "a sound education in every department of polite learning can be had, at a very moderate expense...  It has pretty good endowments in the way of land, and is a valuable and useful institution."&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, Charles; ''American Notes''.  Cited in ''The College Times'', Summer 1910, pg. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:UCC-hall.jpg|left|thumb|270px|Watercolour of UCC's dining hall by John Howard, in 1842]]

By 1887, despite an enrolment of 300 that was quickly outgrowing the 1831 buildings, UCC came close to closing its doors when a [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] provincial government, which supported university federation and saw the College's endowment and downtown campus as sources of funds for such an expensive venture, came to power.  That year a Notice of Motion was introduced to the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Legislature]] by a Liberal [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Member]] named Waters: "in the opinion of this House the time has come when Upper Canada College should be abolished... as the instruction given in the College can be obtained in any well conducted high school in the province,"&lt;ref&gt;John D. Robart's Research Library, University of Toronto,  ''Newspaper Hansard'', March 12, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; adding that the College's real estate should go to the province.  In reaction to this, a group of [[Old boy network|Old Boys]] met, along with letters of support from various alumni, including Lieutenant Governor [[John Beverley Robinson]], in an effort to stop the closing of the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/10/15/the-oldest-kids-on-the-block/| last=Barker| first=Paul| title=The oldest kids on the block| date=15 October 2013| newspaper=National Post| accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The meeting ended with a unanimous motion that the group's views be laid before the government.  The story was covered widely in the papers of the time, with the ''[[Toronto Telegram|Evening Telegram]]'' being most supportive, the ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe]]'' taking a more moderate stance, and the ''News'' criticizing the existence of the school.  In the end, after much negotiation, a decision was reached to detach the school from King's College after fifty years of affiliation, and to operate it under the guidance of five trustees appointed by the Minister of Education. The College was also to be relocated to an area outside of the city, though this provision was not included in the statute.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

==Move==
[[Image:UCC1.jpg|thumb|Upper Canada College buildings at Deer Park]]

On July 3, 1891, the bell at the Russell Square campus rang for the last time, and on August 29, a farewell cricket game was played. The Upper Canada College Old Boys' Association was created on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=112995 Upper Canada College association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208015817/http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=112995 |date=2010-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UCC then moved to its current site, the Deer Park campus ({{coord|43.6933|N|79.4042|W|}}), 200 Lonsdale Road at Avenue Road in [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], with the doors being officially opened on October 14, 1891.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

''U.C.C. march'' for piano composed by J. Bedford Campbell is the Upper Canada College march and two-step. The music was published in Toronto; New York; Chicago by W.F. Shaw Pub. Co., circa 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Upper Canada College march and two-step http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/c.php?id=5364138&amp;l=eng&amp;s=amicus&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, a separate Preparatory School was built at the south edge of the campus, creating two physically separate schools.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

==World Wars==
More than 400 graduates perished during both the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]], the first being Lt. C. Gordon Mackenzie of the Royal Scots Fusiliers, on October 24, 1914.  By the end of WWI, 176 Old Boys were dead.&lt;ref name="Howard2"&gt;Howard, Richard; ''Upper Canada College, 1829-1979: Colborne's Legacy''; Macmillan Company of Canada, 1979; Pg. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:UCC-ambulance.jpg|left|thumb|Ambulance purchased by the boys of UCC in 1916]]
One year later the Upper Canada College ambulance was presented to the forces, and was delivered to France at the beginning of 1916.  By May the next year the vehicle had travelled almost three thousand miles, and carried five thousand wounded men.&lt;ref name="Howard2" /&gt;

The outbreak of the Second World War saw the College lose a number of its best masters, although the majority were too old to join and remained behind at the school.  UCC welcomed a large number of war [[refugee]]s; by May 1941 there were ninety seven. The increasing number led to some concern amongst the Board of Governors, as these students were not paying tuition.&lt;ref name="Kill" /&gt;  A war chest was also started for the purpose of sending packages to Old Boys, and help support the children of Old Boys killed or wounded in battle.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Howard, Richard; ''Upper Canada College, 1829-1979: Colborne's Legacy''; Macmillan Company of Canada, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Jack Granatstein]], in his book ''The Generals'', demonstrated that UCC graduates accounted for more than 30% of Canadian generals during the Second World War, including General [[Harry Crerar]], General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the First Canadian Army, and Major-General [[Bruce Matthews (General)|Bruce Matthews]], General Officer Commanding the [[2nd Canadian Division]] and later Chairman of the College's Board of Governors.  In total, 26 Old Boys achieved [[brigadier]] rank or higher in WWII.&lt;ref&gt;Killbourn, William; ''Toronto Remembered''; Soddart Publishing, Toronto; 1984; Pg. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 ''The War Book of Upper Canada College'' was published, commemorating each Old Boy who served in the "Great War" of 1914-1918.  Those who gave their lives are contained in a separate section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivecdbooks.ca/index.cfm?fuseaction=store.viewProduct&amp;ID=1855&amp;type=title&amp;strKeywords=war%20book&amp;WCID=90D5039DA1AEF19B5F0C055D82B035B1: ''The War Book of Upper Canada College''; Toronto (1914-1919); Published 1923]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also two [[Gilding|gilt]] boards in the College's main foyer that commemorate the names of the dead, one for each World War.

==After the War: Vincent Massey's influence==
During the time of the Rev. Sowby's regime as principal, [[Vincent Massey]] rekindled his interest in the college, and, during the latter's time as [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], often discussed the College's circumstances with Sowby.  They worked together to bring in distinguished guests to address the students and/or inspect the College. Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]] laid a [[cornerstone]] for the College's Memorial Wing,&lt;ref name="TandN"&gt;[http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=7293 Upper Canada College: Then &amp; Now] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101318/http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=7293 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Viscount Montgomery]] inspected the cadets, declaring them "the best cadet corps he had encountered in his career."  It was also during this time that the [[medieval]] office of [[Visitor]] was revived at UCC, with Prince Philip being the first occupant.&lt;ref name="Kill"&gt;Killbourn, William; ''Toronto Remembered''; Soddart Publishing, Toronto; 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

UCC's chapel was built in the early 1950s, funded by Massey and dedicated to his wife, Alice Parkin, who was the daughter of UCC principal George Parkin.  Sowby had a piece of the altar cloth used at the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] donated for use in the chapel, and the dean of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] gave marble from the ruins of the parts of the structure destroyed by bombing during WWII.&lt;ref name="Kill" /&gt;

During one of Massey's visits to UCC, as Sowby was guiding the party through the main [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]], two ladies spotted the letters "F-U-C-K" chalked upside down on the bricks below one of the main tower windows.  Massey stated "it looks like [[Russian language|Russian]] to me," but after donning his glasses, realised what it said, and assured the principal that these things happened in the best of schools. The offending students, both 14-year-olds, owned up to the crime, and were ordered to write an apology to the Governor General.  Massey immediately responded to them.&lt;ref&gt;Killbourn, William; Toronto Remembered; Soddart Publishing, Toronto; 1984; Pg. 186-187&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building crisis==
The College faced a crisis at the end of the 1950s when it was discovered that the 1891 main building was decaying rapidly due to poor construction; cracks were appearing throughout, pipes split, and doors frames warped to the point where doors could no longer be opened or closed.  Due to fear that the tower would collapse the building was condemned and evacuated by March 12, 1958;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=204 Principal Jim Power, Founder's Day Assembly, Feb. 2, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911164746/http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=204 |date=2006-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; faculty offices were moved to the Prep building, the infirmary, and any other spare spaces, including the principal's residence, Grant House.  Classes were conducted in portables.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

That same year, a major fundraising campaign was launched as construction of a new building on the exact site of the old was started.  Prince Philip visited in 1959 to assist with the fundraising, and money to reconstruct the iconic tower over the main entrance was donated by the media magnate, [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Ted Rogers]].&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;  In the summer of 1959, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] Massey laid the cornerstone, however, the pleasure with progress was marred when tragedy struck that same year: an Italian construction worker fell from the tower to his death. None-the-less, [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field Marshal Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein]] dedicated the new front doors on April 28, 1960, and the new building was officially opened by Vincent Massey and Edward Peacock on September 28.  The $3,200,000 cost of the building was fully subscribed.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

==Late 20th century==
UCC welcomed the first woman to its Board of Governors in 1971 with the appointment of [[Pauline Mills McGibbon]],&lt;ref name="TandN" /&gt; although she resigned in 1974 upon her appointment to the post of [[Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario]]. Five years following her departure, UCC celebrated its 150th anniversary in the presence of the College's Official Visitor, Prince Philip, at the College's first Association Day,&lt;ref name="TandN" /&gt; and Sandi Ryder became the first woman elected to the College's Board of Governors.&lt;ref name="TandN" /&gt;
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:UCC-duke.jpg|left|thumb|HRH The Duke of Edinburgh speaks with UCC First Football team members at the College's 150th anniversary celebrations, 1979]] --&gt;

By 1980 boarding for Prep students ended,&lt;ref name="TandN" /&gt; with some of the dormitories being converted to computer labs where students learned the fostering technology.

In 1991, UCC was visited by the [[Heads of state of Hungary|Hungarian President]] [[Árpád Göncz]], who would soon after enrol his grandson at the school,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ucc.on.ca/current%20times/CurrentTimes-200209.pdf ''Current Times'': Association News and Notes; September 2002; Pg. 6] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104232919/http://www1.ucc.on.ca/current%20times/CurrentTimes-200209.pdf |date=November 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1993, Prince Philip again visited to officially open the [[Foster Hewitt]] Athletic Centre, the [[Eaton Family|Eaton]] Building, as well as the rebuilt College gates, the Mara Gates, at the foot of the main avenue.&lt;ref name="TandN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/fr-rf/visit-eng.cfm#a2 HRH Prince Philip's private and official visits to Canada since 1953]&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later the College decided to greatly alter its academic course and adopted the [[International Baccalaureate]] programme.

[[James FitzGerald (writer)|James FitzGerald]], a UCC Old Boy himself, published a book in 1994 titled ''Old Boys; the Powerful Legacy of Upper Canada College''.  It stirred up some controversy in Canadian media due to its candid portrayal of life at the College, derived from excerpts of interviews that FitzGerald had conducted with former students, ranging from [[Conrad Black]] and [[Michael Ignatieff]] to unknowns who managed gas stations or worked in retail.  Reactions varied; Charlotte Gray wrote in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'': "My reaction to this book is fascinated revulsion - mainly because the school seems to have taught successive generations of boys that girls are some alien species that is both terrifying and stupid,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamesfitzgerald.info/Charlotte.html James T. FitzGerald website: Charlotte Gray - Full Review]&lt;/ref&gt; while Jill Rigby said in the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'': "Yeah, so what if some UCC teachers were pedophiles? All that stuff has been going on in educational institutions since Socrates met Plato."&lt;ref name="Rev"&gt;[http://jamesfitzgerald.info/UCC.html James T. FitzGerald website: Reviews]&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of the book had an effect on the College, both in its internal structure, as well as its relationship with the broader community.  Peter Dalglish, the founder of [[Street Kids International]], criticised the school heavily in his interview for ''Old Boys'', where he said "A prime failing of UCC is that they have no sense of being a part of a community within the city or country. The school has to change; it is still very upper middle class."  Subsequently, he was hired by the College to change school culture.  Under his direction, along with Nanci Goldman, the former Toronto Board co-ordinator of inner city services, UCC students have since been partnered with inner city Toronto kids in the College's Horizon program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamesfitzgerald.info/Ted.html James T. Fitzgerald website: Ted Schmidt - Full Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eaton Building was extended in 1999 to accommodate the school's curricular expansion to include grades 1 and 2.  Senior kindergarten was introduced in 2003.&lt;ref name="TandN" /&gt;

==New millennium==
Early into the new millennium, UCC followed the trend in [[environmentalism]] when the Board of Governors voted to establish the Green School initiative in 2002, wherein environmental education would become "one of the four hallmarks of a UCC education."  This education would include ecological literacy, environmental ethics, and contributions to broader society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ucc.on.ca/current%20times/CurrentTimes-200209.pdf ''Current Times'': Governors Agree: UCC to be a Green School; September 2002; Pg. 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104232919/http://www1.ucc.on.ca/current%20times/CurrentTimes-200209.pdf |date=November 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would see not only upgrades of the school's physical plant to meet environmentally sustainable standards, but also an integration of these new initiatives into the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ucc.on.ca/current%20times/CurrentTimes-200212.pdf ''Current Times'': Executive Director of Green School sought; December 2002; Pg. 5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104233359/http://www.ucc.on.ca/current%20times/CurrentTimes-200212.pdf |date=November 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cadets==
[[Image:UCC-Cadets.jpg|thumb|Upper Canada College Cadets, 1893]]
There is no definite date for the formation of the Upper Canada College Cadets, though beginnings can be traced to a willingness of students to participate in the defence against the [[Rebellions of 1837|1837 rebellion]] in [[Upper Canada]].  Later in the 1800s, in schools throughout England, Canada and the United States, involvement in a military body was thought of to inspire patriotism in young men, as well as teaching discipline and obedience.  By 1863, UCC students were paraded weekly, in an amateur fashion, under Major Goodwin, but with the beginning of [[Fenian]] troubles in Upper Canada in 1865, UCC students requested that the Cadets form into a company of [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada]].  By 1866, the request was fulfilled, making UCC possibly the second school in Canada to have a proper Cadet Corps (the first being [[Bishop's College School]] in Lennoxville, Quebec).&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

When the Fenians did attack [[Fort Erie, Ontario]], on June 1, 1866 (see [[Fenian raids#Niagara raid (1866)|Fenian Raids]]), the UCC Cadets, along with the Bishop's College Cadets, were called to duty, but were instructed only to guard the armouries and official stores.  None-the-less, this was the only time in Canadian military history where student Cadet Corps were called to duty.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

By the 1890s, there was a lack of enthusiasm for the Cadets.  It was an extra expense for a student's family to cover the costs of uniform, weapons, and even their drill instructor.  As well, drill and practice time was beyond the commitment to scholastics and sport.  Enrolment fluctuated over the next few decades, at one point the school's administration turning its eyes to the school the College had been modelled on, [[Eton College|Eton]], as well as [[Harrow School|Harrow]], where Cadet participation was compulsory.  No real action was taken by UCC in regards to the Cadets; however, by 1910 the population of the company had increased to 63, and in 1912 a Sergeant Carpenter was approached to act as an instructor.  He was not to last long, as by 1914 he was in Europe as Sergeant-Major in the 9th Battalion of the 1st Canadian Overseas Contingent.  Numbers in the UCC Cadets still stayed high during the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

By around 1919, the UCC Cadets became compulsory, and principal Grant asked the army district headquarters if the Corps could be presented with [[Colours, standards and guidons#Australia and Canada|Colours]], both the King's Colour and College Colour.  The College Colour was given by Elanor Gooderham in 1921.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

During the war, the Cadets' association with the Queen's Own Rifles had lapsed, and by 1923 two regiments, the Toronto Regiment and Queen's Own Rifles were requesting that the Corps affiliate itself with them.  After some dispute between the three parties, the College settled on the Queen's Own again by 1927.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

For thirty following years, the Cadets remained a part of College life, and by the middle of the [[World War II|Second World War]] boys were practising not only drills, but also spent time on lectures, map reading, military law, and signalling.  The biggest ceremony of the school year was the Battalion Inspection Day, when the cadet corps would assemble in their dress uniforms, consisting of navy-blue uniforms and [[beret]]s, black leather boots and [[Spats (footwear)|spats]], white gloves; officers also wore a sword and [[Sam Browne belt|Sam Browne]], sergeants a red sash. The guns carried were [[Ross rifle|Ross .303s]].&lt;ref&gt;Killbourn, William; ''Toronto Remembered''; Soddart Publishing, Toronto; 1984; Pg. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s belief in the Cadets was faltering; religion and patriotism were not held in such high regard by youth, and rebellion was the more accepted behaviour for teenagers.  Minutes of the Board of Governors meeting in 1965 recorded, for the first time in sixty years, poor discipline at the battalion parade.  Principal Richard Sadlier disbanded the Cadet Battalion as a compulsory body in 1976, noting: "The Battalion has been left with little beyond its ceremonial drill which is a pretty irrelevant exercise to many people today and difficult to defend when it becomes the be-all and end-all of a program."&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;

In 1977, the voluntary [[Royal Canadian Army Cadets]] helped organize a course in military science at UCC, which also included battle drill, field craft, weapons training, and some parade-square drill.  But, by the mid-1980s, interest in this programme had fallen to a bare minimum, and today UCC provides no formal military training.&lt;ref name="Howard" /&gt;

==Ethnic and gender issues==
UCC began admitting [[Minority group#Racial or ethnic minorities|ethnic minority]] students early in its history.  The first black student enrolled in 1831 the first Jewish student in 1836 and the first aboriginal student in 1840; some graduates from the [[Ojibway]] peoples of [[Upper Canada]] having gone on to study at [[Dartmouth College]] and [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/law/LRI/Legal_education/borrows.htm Borrows, John; ''"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?" The Diversification of Canadian Law Schools''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529105231/http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/law/LRI/Legal_education/borrows.htm |date=May 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there have been ethnic minority students admitted to UCC, the school continued to maintain a reputation as a "bastion of [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] privilege" through the first 150 years of its history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8141&amp;Itemid=86 Kirshner, Sheldon; ''Canadian Jewish News'': Peter Newman looks back on a productive life]&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to this, diplomat [[James George (diplomat)|James George]], a student between 1926 and 1936, said upon reflection about his time with other UCC graduates in the [[Foreign Affairs Canada|Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs]]: "If UCC really was a womb matrix for a bunch of WASP patriots, why did it produce so many internationalists?"&lt;ref name="Fitz"&gt;[http://jamesfitzgerald.info/Excerpts.html James T. Fitzgerald website: Fitzgerald, James; ''Old Boys: The Powerful Legacy of Upper Canada College''; excerpts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other former students took a different view, some citing experiences of [[anti-Semitism]]. Graham Fraser,  ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'''s Washington Bureau Chief, who attended UCC between 1960 and 1964, recalled: "Anti-Semitism was generally an unspoken undercurrent at UCC, but a couple of times I witnessed overt anti-Semitism.... Before 1960, Toronto was a pretty narrow, close-minded, little Victorian town and Upper Canada College reflected that reality."&lt;ref name="Fitz" /&gt;  At the same time, [[Peter C. Newman]], who came to UCC from [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1940, and who is Jewish himself, said that anti-Semitism was "virtually non-existent" at the school.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Pg. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Ignatieff]], who was a student at the College from 1959 to 1965 stated: "The UCC culture in my time was basically Tory, Anglican and fantastically patrician...  The Canadian elite must be an open, permeable elite which is colour blind, religion blind and gender blind. There has to be an elite based not even on intelligence but character. They will mostly come from schools that bear no resemblance to Upper Canada College."&lt;ref name="Fitz" /&gt;

In the decades after the 1970s, some saw the ethnic composition of the school's enrollment as changing.  In 1979, former Prep School Headmaster Richard Howard said in his book ''Upper Canada College, 1929-1979: Colborne's Legacy'': "The growth of the enrolment has increased the number of boys from a wide variety of backgrounds and decreased the ratio of those from old Toronto families.  The address list now reflects Toronto's ethnic variety and resembles a small United Nations."&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Richard; ''Upper Canada College, 1829-1979: Colborne's Legacy''; Macmillan Company of Canada; 1979; pg. 264
&lt;/ref&gt;  William Kilbourn also said that the College had been accepting, for many years before the 1980s, a number of foreign students, notably from Latin America and Asia, and that UCC had made a concentrated effort to recruit [[Quebec]] [[francophone]]s into the student body.  By the 1980s the school was offering financial assistance to the less affluent, and was making serious attempts to encourage boys from visible minorities to enroll.  But, few applied, save for many [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]], East Indian, and [[Japanese Canadian]]s who were accepted into the Prep; in 1983 the numbers were 42 out of a total student population of 361.&lt;ref&gt;Killbourn, William; ''Toronto Remembered''; Soddart Publishing, Toronto; 1984; Pg. 190&lt;/ref&gt; However, even into the 1990s some, while acknowledging the shift to a more [[Multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] student body, claimed anti-Semitism continued in some form. In 1990, ''The College Times'' featured an editorial stating that while UCC was no longer "a white-bread, right-wing fortress: it has become much more multi-cultural and (dare I say it?) liberal.... In my years at UCC I have faced anti-Semitism, ugliness, stupidity and bureaucracy."&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Motek; ''College Times'': Editorial; 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1990s, the college was increasingly diverse, and in 1997 the daily recitation of the Lord's Prayer was replaced by the recitation of a prayer from different global faiths each day.  In 2002, student Adam Sheikh created the Diversity Council to celebrate the cultural diversity of the school's student population.  This council, a body of students independent from the school administration, organizes celebrations of [[China|Chinese]], [[Jewish]], and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] cultural events and traditions, as well as Canadian cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harmony.ca/scholarships/ Harmony Scholarship]&lt;/ref&gt;

UCC's website states that "the College's boarding program welcomes Upper School students from all faiths and cultural backgrounds. Each year, more than 100 students from Year 1 to IB2 come together in this cross-cultural hub, where students benefit from each other's unique experiences."

Students from about 16 countries attend UCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=112854 | title=College History | publisher=Upper Canada College | accessdate=February 11, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706193125/http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=112854 | archivedate=July 6, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The international students typically come from among the wealthiest families in the countries of their origin.

The 1990 College Times also addressed alleged sexism at the school in the article ''The School On The Hill'' by Greg Tessaro, winner of the College Times' Ponton Prize for Journalism. The article stated:
:"The school fosters sexist attitudes that impair the students.... There is undeniably sexism at the school. The '88 Times had a running joke in the Leaving Class section, "Why beer is better than women", with examples like "Fact #19: Beer doesn't demand equality" ...A careful look through past yearbooks reveals a sexist viewpoint that would not be tolerated at a co-ed school. The school itself is the direct cause of this sexism. ...The school teaches sexism by example. ...In addition, on a staff of over sixty full-time teachers, there are three women. However, in my time at the College, the French conversation teacher has always been a woman. The librarians are all women. The secretaries are all women."&lt;ref&gt;Tessaro, Greg; ''College Times'': The School On The Hill; 1990; Pg. 154-155&lt;/ref&gt;

UCC did, however, appoint the first woman to its Board of Governors in 1971; [[Pauline Mills McGibbon]]. The College also states:
:"We value diversity and are actively engaged in building a school that reflects the various backgrounds of our community members. We recognize that embracing a mix of cultures, talents, backgrounds, experiences and socioeconomic diversity will make the College a more rewarding place in which to learn and work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=7337 Upper Canada College: Career Opportunities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907180619/http://www.ucc.on.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=7337 |date=2006-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandals==

Upper Canada College has had a number of incidents in the decade following 1998 where staff were accused of [[statutory rape]] or of possessing [[child pornography]].  Only three ended in convictions. In early February 2007, the school mailed a letter to the entire UCC community apologizing for the sexual and physical abuse at the school and referring to the abuse of students as the most difficult issue the school has had to face in its 177-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/177488 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | title=UCC sends apology for abuse | first=Debra | last=Black | date=February 2, 2007 | accessdate=May 4, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206185826/http://www.thestar.com/News/article/177488|archivedate=December 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An appeal is currently in the works. A settlement was reached between the victims and the college.

The judge told the court that Cook touched his pupils inappropriately as a way to control and abuse the students without their consent, saying Cook has abused his "significant power in a way that violated the sexual integrity" of his pupils, and not for reasons of sexual gratification. In the November 2006 sentencing, he was spared jail time and instead sentenced to house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/59666/No_jail_for_teacher_in_sex_assault Pazzano, Sam; ''Toronto Sun'': No jail for teacher in sex assault; November 23, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''homework coach''' is a category of [[tutor]] whose mission is to help a student's overall academic success as opposed to providing remedial instruction in a specific subject. A parent might hire a homework coach when their child is struggling in school not because they have difficulties with the academic material but because of problems with study skills, organization, [[executive function]] skills and motivation. The goal of the coach is to teach the child to become a successful student by learning to plan assignments, organize materials, manage time effectively and, in the case of an ADHD student, learn ways to manage the symptoms of their attention deficit disorder. As such, the role of a homework coach is similar to [[ADHD coaching]] but is focused specifically on success in school. Some providers use the term "homework helper" as well as "homework coach."

==Applicability==
A homework coach is indicated for any student whose poor performance in school or college appears to be more related to organization and study skills rather than difficulty understanding the instructional material. Such students may show signs of ADHD or Executive Function disorder. Current statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control show that as many as 11% of school children 4–17 years in age had received an ADHD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/features/key-findings-adhd72013.html&lt;/ref&gt; Among ADHD students, about 33% will not graduate high school with their peers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395610002001 | doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.06.014 | volume=45 | title=Childhood and adolescent onset psychiatric disorders, substance use, and failure to graduate high school on time | journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research | pages=295–301| pmc=2962709 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is about twice the rate of the non-ADHD student population.  By hiring a homework coach, parents hope that the added support in building study skills, helping plan assign assignments, test-taking strategies and general homework monitoring will keep their children on track in school and increase their chances of graduating on time.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2010/12/01/homework-helpers-helicopter-parenting/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
The efficacy of homework coaching is in general measured by parents in terms of higher grades and less discord in the household over their student's homework habits. One study of 110 ADHD college students found that coaching was "highly effective in helping students improve executive functioning and related skills as measured by the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory." &lt;ref&gt;https://edgefoundation.org/blog/2010/11/12/edge-announces-study-results-11-12-10/&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many anecdotal news stories and case studies relating how a homework coach has helped students improve their grades and self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/nyregion/08homework.html&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity and tempo of homeworkes affect stress resistance and quite emmotsionalny state of the pupil. The correct approach to the implementation of tasks will allow to perform all tasks with maximum efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.assignmentexpert.com/blog/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5152">An '''honor student''' is a student recognized for achieving high [[grading (education)|grades]] or high marks in their coursework at school.

==United States==

In the US honors students may refer to:
# Students recognized for their academic achievement on lists published periodically throughout the school year, known as honors roll, varying from school to school, shows the student going above and beyond and from enlarged different levels of education.
# Students enrolled in designated honors courses or honors program.
# Students who are members of the [[National Honor Society]] or other [[honor society]].

Honors students are often recognized for their achievements. A student who has made numerous appearances on the honor roll may be awarded some form of [[Varsity letter|academic letter]], or any other form of notification.&lt;ref name="letterwinners" /&gt; A similar concept to honor rolls exists in colleges and universities in the United States, known as the [[Dean's List]].

==Elsewhere in the world==

In other countries, the meaning of honours can refer either to a specific type of [[academic degree]] or to the level of distinction with which an undergraduate degree was earned.

[[Honours degrees]] are usually four-year programs (sometimes also three-year programs, e.g., in England). A student who holds a ''de jure'' Honours degree is eligible for direct entry either to a Doctorate (Ph.D.) or to a two- to three years very-high-research Master's degree program.

'Honours' can also mean that students have achieved their degree with a high overall average [[GPA]] and typically have undertaken a small final project, paper or essay (also known in the UK as a dissertation). See [[British undergraduate degree classification]].

A third meaning is a postgraduate ''with Honours'' or ''cum honored'' degree, which is (part of) an academic degree itself, e.g. the one-year Bachelor with Honours degree in Australia, the one-year Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree in Canada or the four-year integrated Master with Honours degree in Scotland. Postgraduate Honours degree programs generally involve completion of master's level courses and the submission of a long high-research [[thesis]].

== Criticism ==
Some researchers have questioned the validity of the honor roll as an effective form of [[positive reinforcement]]. It is argued that the pursuit of extrinsic reward is not an accurate reflection of intrinsic interest in course material.&lt;ref name="fx" /&gt; There are also questions on the effectiveness of separating high-achieving students from their peers, in the form of [[magnet school]]s or honors courses.&lt;ref name="effectiveness" /&gt;

== Honors courses ==
An honors course is a class in which the most advanced students are placed. Most students placed in honors courses are highly motivated and dedicated to their educational experience.&lt;ref name="courses" /&gt; Honors classes also cover advanced material, permit more in-depth study than a standard course of study and may require independent research.

Motivation is the main quality that characterizes an honors student. In addition to being committed to academics, they are encouraged and many participate in volunteer work, organizations and clubs, cooperative education, research, study abroad and cultural activities.&lt;ref name="mission" /&gt;

[[Honors programs]] have specific entrance requirements and completion criteria in order to graduate with Honors, or [[cum laude]].

'''''Hoyle Casino Empire''''' is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] developed and published by [[Sierra Entertainment]] on Windows computers, in which the player must run a casino and try to make profit, attract customers and get good ratings.

==Gameplay==
The goal of ''Hoyle Casino Empire'' is to create a thriving casino. There are two modes in the game; Empire Mode and Sandbox Mode. Empire Mode sends the player to one of eight casinos starting with a small one and working up to the biggest casino. In each casino the player will have specific objectives to meet in a limited time in order turn the casino into a successful place. Not meeting the objectives in time will end the game. Sandbox mode allows the player to build whatever casino desired without any objectives to follow or limited time. In this mode, the player is limited to one kind of casino, but can unlock more upon winning them from the Empire Mode.

The player starts in a specific kind of building with a limited amount of starting money, certain areas of space to build, and starting at a First Level Status. A Level Status determines what kind of casino games and services can be built in the casino. Increasing a Level Status requires a sum of cash, a number of customers in the casino and a number of good ratings. The Level Status can go as high as four. The number of customers can be increased by introducing more games and services and the good ratings can be increased by introducing variety, room decor, building extensions, cash donations, deluxe services and satisfying customers' general requirements.

General requirements for customers include cash desks (and ATMs) to withdraw money for gambling, bathrooms, eating establishments, drinking establishments and hotel accommodations. If those general requirements are not met, customers may decide to leave the casino and give bad reviews. Cash donations can only keep dissatisfied customers happy temporarily. Customers come in different classes, ranging from Tourists who carry little cash to VIPs who have lots of money. When building games and services in the casino, maintenance is needed to keep the casino running. Service men are needed to maintain the slot machines, custodians keep the casino and bathrooms clean, waitresses serve drinks and security guards keep unwanted offenders out.

Earning money legally is done by establishing sufficient services to the number of customers and accepting commercial stunt deals with agreements met. However money can be earned illegitimately by increasing the House Edge to Cheating Mode, accepting crooked deals such as money laundering. Such illegalities can lead to financial losses and degrading of ratings if found out by city authorities. While attempting to earn profit, the player must keep in mind the maintenance and employee wage expenses that present in the gameplay. If money goes below zero, then the player is in debt and cannot spend on anymore services or building until sufficient cash is earned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1963">'''Intercalation''', in the context of [[university administration]], is a period when a [[student]] is allowed to officially take time away from studying for an [[academic degree]].

When a [[university]] or similar institution allows a student to intercalate, it is usually for one of the following reasons:

'''James William Loewen''' (born February 6, 1942) is an American sociologist, historian, and author, best known for his 1995 book, ''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me|Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong]]'', which was republished in 2008, and again in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lies-My-Teacher-Told-Everything/dp/1595583262/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382090981&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=james+loewen+lies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Loewen was born in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]], [[Illinois]], to Winifred and David F. Loewen, on February 6, 1942. His mother was a [[librarian]] and teacher, and his father was a [[medical director]] and doctor. Loewen grew up in Decatur. He was a [[National Merit Scholar]] as a graduate in 1960 from [[MacArthur High School (Illinois)|MacArthur High School]].&lt;ref name="sundown.tougaloo.edu"&gt;http://sundown.tougaloo.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Loewen attended [[Carleton College]]. In 1963, as a junior, he spent a semester in [[Mississippi]], an experience in a different culture that led to his questioning what he had been taught about [[United States history]]. He was intrigued by learning about the unique place of nineteenth-century Chinese immigrants and their descendants in Mississippi culture, commonly thought of as biracial. Loewen went on to earn a PhD in [[sociology]] from [[Harvard University]] based on his research on [[Chinese Americans]] in Mississippi.&lt;ref name="sundown.tougaloo.edu"/&gt;

==Career==
Loewen first taught in Mississippi at [[Tougaloo College]], a [[historically black college]]&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;Cheney, Matt. [http://sundown.tougaloo.edu/content.php?file=biography.html "Biography of James W. Loewen"]. University of Illinois. Retrieved 2010-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by the [[American Missionary Association]] after the [[American Civil War]]. For 20 years, Loewen taught about racism at the [[University of Vermont]], where he is now professor ''[[emeritus]]'' of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Loewen.

===First Amendment battle===
Loewen co-authored a United States history [[textbook]], ''Mississippi: Conflict and Change'' (1974), which won the [[Lillian Smith Book Award]] for Best Southern Nonfiction in 1975. However, the book was rejected for use in Mississippi's public schools by the Mississippi Textbook Purchasing Board on the grounds that it was too controversial and placed too much focus on racial matters.

Loewen challenged the Board's decision in a [[lawsuit]], ''Loewen v. Turnipseed'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.crin.org/en/library/legal-database/loewen-v-turnipseed | title=Loewen v. Turnipseed | publisher=[[Child Rights International Network]] (CRIN) | accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evergreen.edu/news/archive/2008/05/jamesloewen&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Orma R. Smith]] of the [[U.S. District Court]] ruled that the rejection of the textbook was not based on "justifiable grounds", and that the authors were denied their right to [[free speech]] and press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/oif/firstamendment/courtcases/courtcases.cfm "Notable First Amendment court cases"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210022833/http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/oif/firstamendment/courtcases/courtcases.cfm |date=2011-12-10 }}. [[American Library Association]]. Retrieved 2010-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Library Association]] considers ''Loewen v. Turnipseed'', [[case citation|488 F. Supp. 1138]] ([[United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi|N.D. Miss.]] 1980), a historic [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] case and one of the foundations of the "right to read freely."

===''Lies My Teacher Told Me''===
{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?63448-1/lies-teacher-told-me ''Booknotes'' interview with Louwen on ''Lies My Teacher Told Me'', March 26, 1995], [[C-SPAN]]}}
Loewen spent two years at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], where he studied and compared twelve [[American history]] textbooks then widely used throughout the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="sundown.tougaloo.edu"/&gt;  He published his findings in ''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me|Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong]]'' (1995). He concluded that textbook authors propagate factually false, [[Eurocentric]], and mythologized views of history. Loewen points out in the book that many of the distortions found in American history texts are "not even by the authors whose names grace the cover."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truth-out.org/speakout/item/18124-oh-what-a-web-textbooks-weave&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, the book's publisher, [[The New Press]], listed ''Lies My Teacher Told Me'' as their top all-time bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;"The New Press Index," March 2012, {{cite web |url=http://thenewpress.com/catalog_pdfs/thenewpress_fall2012catalog.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102034516/http://thenewpress.com/catalog_pdfs/thenewpress_fall2012catalog.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book reflects Loewen's belief that history should not be taught as straightforward facts and dates to memorize, but rather as analysis of the context and root causes of events.&lt;ref&gt;http://sundown.tougaloo.edu/liesmyteachertoldme.php&lt;/ref&gt; Loewen recommends that teachers use two or more textbooks, so that students may realize the contradictions and ask questions, such as, "Why do the authors present the material like this?"

===''Teaching What Really Happened''===
Loewen builds off of ''Lies My Teacher Told Me'' in ''Teaching What Really Happened: How to Avoid the Tyranny of Textbooks &amp; Get Students Excited About Doing History'' and lays out an argument for how history should be taught at the elementary and secondary levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://sundown.tougaloo.edu/ The Homepage of James Loewen.&lt;/ref&gt; The first four chapters get to the heart of Loewen’s argument on how history should be taught and chapters 5–10 are about specific issues in history and how to teach them effectively.  Chapter one makes the argument that history teachers need to free themselves from the history textbooks and go more in depth with specific issues in history.  In chapter two Loewen argues that teacher expectations play a role in student performance, and knowing this can help teachers to close achievement gaps among students. The third chapter lays out why historiography is and should be important to students. Chapter four gives teachers ways to help students “Do history, [and] not merely learn it”.

Chapters 5–10 treat special cases in history such as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[the South seceding from the United States]]. At the end of each chapter is a “Focused Bibliography" which lists additional readings that Loewen feels are important to the chapter. The book is focused at current and future teachers, who may be frustrated with the way that history is usually presented at the elementary and secondary levels and provides ideas on how it should be taught and how to get students engaged.&lt;ref&gt;http://store.tcpress.com/0807749915.shtml 'Teaching What Really Happened', Teachers College Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent writings===
{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?189492-2/sundown-towns-hidden-dimension-american-racism Presentation by Louwen on ''Sundown Towns'', October 23, 2005], [[C-SPAN]]}}
Continuing his interest in racism in the United States, Loewen wrote ''[[Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism]]'', which was released in 2005. The book documents the histories of [[sundown town]]s, which are towns where [[African American]]s, [[American Jews|Jews]], and other [[minority groups]] were forced (or strongly encouraged) to leave prior to sundown in order to avoid racist violence threatened and perpetrated by the towns' majority white populations.&lt;ref&gt;http://sundown.tougaloo.edu/sundowntowns.php&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the book, in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', noted that even though Loewen dedicated an entire chapter to research methodology, his claims regarding the number of communities which supported racial exclusion policies is both widely variable and vague. The review stated "This vagueness, along with Loewen's almost evangelical passion for his material, raises questions of credibility – or at least of potential overstatement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/20/AR2005102001715.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |title=Darkness on the Edge of Town |date=October 23, 2005 |first=Laura |last=Wexler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loewen has written about sundown towns repeatedly throughout his career, including in ''Lies Across America'', where he notably cited the affluent suburb of [[Darien, Connecticut]] as meeting his definition of a modern-day ''de facto'' sundown town.

''Sundown Towns'' garnered the illustrious Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award. It also gained excellent reviews in ''Publishers Weekly'' and ''Booklist''. The book inspired a nationwide online initiative to monitor and list sunset towns across the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenewpress.com/books/sundown-towns|title=Sundown Towns {{!}} The New Press|work=The New Press|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Loewen and Edward H. Sebesta co-authored the book, ''The Confederate and Neo-Confederate Reader: The Great Truth about the Lost Cause'', an anthology containing a wide array of [[Primary source|primary source documents]] pertaining to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] from the time of the [[American Civil War]].

At present, Loewen is researching a new book, ''Surprises on the Landscape: Unexpected Places That Get History Right''. The book is planned as follow-up to ''[[Lies Across America]]'', which noted historically inaccurate or misleading historical markers and sites across the [[United States]].  ''Surprises'' will call attention to historical sites that are accurate and provide honest representations of events.  His official website invites the public to comment on what towns and historical sites should be included in terms of presenting history right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sundown.tougaloo.edu/content.php?file=worksinprogress.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4016">The '''Little School of the 400''' is a program in [[Texas]] to teach [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking children 400 [[English language|English]] words before they entered [[kindergarten]] during the late 1950s.

==History==
Spanish-speaking children in Texas were being discriminated against due to their ignorance of English and their race.  They would then be labeled as ignorant and incapable of learning by the public school teachers, administrators, and systems across the state.  This led to high drop out rates of [[Mexican Americans]], many of whom did not further their education past the third grade.  [[Felix Tijerina]], then the national president of the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] (LULAC), along with Tony Campos, David Adame, and Jacob Rodriguez, devised this program to help children better transition into the English-language environment of public schooling, and ultimately integrating in a segregated Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez Ríos, Erasmo. ''The Little School of the 400: A Mexican-American Fight for Equal Access and its Impact on State Policy'' Master's Thesis, University of Nebraska, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  It was created in 1957 and piloted in [[Ganado, TX]].&lt;ref&gt;Kreneck, Thomas H. ''Mexican American Odyssey: Felix Tijerina'', Entrepreneur and Civic Leader (College Station, TX: Texas A&amp;M Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the program was to teach 400 basic English words to help Spanish-speaking children to manage instruction given in English in the regular public educational system and therefore help them achieve higher levels of schooling.&lt;ref name="ed"&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED158905&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED158905 ed.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

LULAC Council 60, of [[Houston, Texas]], was in charge of the program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lulac.org/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pedagogy]] of the "Little School" was used to model programs such as the [[Bilingual Education Act]], [[Head Start Program|Head Start]], [[Texas Child Migrant Program]], and Title I of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]].&lt;ref name="ed" /&gt;

A Texas Historical Marker now stands at Ganado Elementary School commemorating the program of the LS400.

25th president - elected at the 1956 convention, at the 1957 convention, at the 1958 convention, and, at the 1959 convention held in San Antonio, Texas. Served four terms.

Felix Tijerina, the son of a farm worker, found himself with the heavy responsibility of helping support his widowed mother and three sisters when he was barely nine years old. He toiled in the cotton fields and had no opportunity to attend school. As the hard years went by, he finally moved to Houston, got a job as a dishwasher, taught himself English, married, and established his own restaurant.

He was very successful and eventually became the owner of three restaurants. Wealth brought him invitations to join civic organizations, including LULAC. Tijerina was a member of Houston LULAC Council #60. He held many positions within the council. He was the director of the Rotary Club, of a bank and of numerous enterprises.

Never forgetting his own hardships as a boy who could speak English, Tijerina was the inspiration and financial backer of the Little School of the 400, the precursor of the Headstart Program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7438">'''Michael A. B. Deakin''' (1939–2014){{r|ams}} was an Australian mathematician and mathematics educator. He was known for his work as a writer and editor of ''Function'', a mathematics magazine aimed at high school students,{{r|smh}} and as a biographer of ancient Greek mathematician [[Hypatia]]. He won the B. H. Neumann award of the [[Australian Mathematics Trust]] in 2003 for his "rich and varied commitment to mathematics enrichment".{{r|neumann}}

==Education and career==
Deakin was born in August 1939.{{r|ams}} He grew up in [[Tasmania]], and moved to [[Melbourne]] late in his high school education, taking a second matriculation year studying [[Latin]] at [[St Patrick's College, East Melbourne]] before entering the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1957. He completed a bachelor's degree with second-class honours in mathematics at Melbourne in 1961. He went on to earn a master's degree there in 1963, with a thesis on [[integral equation]]s supervised by Russell Love.{{r|unimelb}}

Deakin moved to the [[University of Chicago]] in 1963 for graduate study, and completed his Ph.D. in 1966. He became a lecturer at [[Monash University]] in Melbourne in 1967, but then in 1970 moved to [[Papua New Guinea]] to become reader-in-charge in the mathematics department of the [[Papua New Guinea University of Technology|Institute of Higher Technical Education]]. He returned to Monash as a senior reader in 1973. He earned a master's degree in education in 1975 from the [[University of Exeter]], and remained at Monash for the rest of his career.{{r|neumann}}

He died on August 5, 2014.{{r|ams|smh}}

In 1976 a group of mathematicians at Monash University led by department chair [[Gordon Preston]] recognized the need for a journal focused "mathematics as mathematicians themselves would recognise it, but addressed to secondary students". A secondary but explicit goal was to encourage young women in mathematics, as at that time their under-representation was already recognized. Later, over beers with friends from other disciplines, Deakin found the name for the new journal, ''Function''.{{r|function}} The journal was published from 1977 to 2004, and Deakin became a founding member of its editorial board, its most frequent contributor, and, for much of its existence, its editor-in-chief.{{r|smh}}

==Hypatia==
Deakin published the first of his several articles on [[Hypatia]] in 1992 in ''Function''.{{r|smh}}
In 2007, he published the book ''Hypatia of Alexandria: Mathematician and Martyr'' (Prometheus Books).{{r|lewis|burns|additional}} Aimed at a popular audience, the book is "at least in part, a response to [[Maria Dzielska]]'s ''Hypatia of Alexandria''", which had focused on the historical and literary legacy of Hypatia at the expense of her mathematics, and which Deakin had previously reviewed for the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]''.{{r|rerighting}} In his book, Deakin organizes the work of other scholars on Hypatia's mathematics, particularly relying on the earlier work of [[Wilbur Knorr]], rather than formulating new theories on this aspect of Hypatia's work.{{r|lewis|burns}}
He argues that, unlike some other [[neoplatonism|neoplatonists]] of her time,
Hypatia was not opposed to Christianity, and that the Christian mob that killed her likely misunderstood her philosophical position.{{r|burns}}
However, his book has been criticized for treating Hypatia more as an idealized icon, or a caricature of a female mathematician, than as a realistic person of her times.{{r|rerighting}}

The '''Minister of Education and Research''' is the senior [[government minister|minister]] at the Ministry of Education and Research (''[[Estonian language|Estonian]]: Eesti Vabariigi Haridus- ja Teadusministeerium'') in the [[Estonian Government]]. The Minister is responsible for administration and development of Estonian educational system as well as for administration and funding of research and development activities on national level.

The Minister of Education and Research is chosen by the [[Prime Minister of Estonia|Prime Minister]] as a part of the government. The current Minister of Education and Research is [[Mailis Reps]], who took the position on 23 November 2016.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The Minister is assisted in his/her work by the Deputy Minister, Secretary General, Secretary for General and Vocational Education, Secretary for Higher Education and Research, and Secretary for Youth Affairs and Foreign Relations.

==History==
Post of the Minister of Education was created at the birth of independent Republic of Estonia on 24 February 1918. From 1928 to 1936 the official title was the Minister of Education and Social Affairs. The end of the Republic of Estonia on 21 June 1940 marked also the end of independent governance of education in Estonia. The Ministry of Education continued from 1940 to 1991 under orders received from Moscow and was merged with the Educational Committee in 1988.

The Ministry of Education was re-established in 1989 to replace the Educational Committee of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. With the restoration of independent Republic of Estonia on 20 August 1991 the Ministry regained its supreme authority on educational issues. In 1993 the ministries of culture and education were merged to form Ministry of Culture and Education. 1996 the old order was restored and a separate Ministry of Education re-established. 2001 the Ministry was relocated to [[Tartu]] due to several economic and regional political arguments, but also due to successful lobby by [[University of Tartu]]. 

On 1 January 2003 the Ministry of Education was renamed to Ministry of Education and Research in order to reflect better its focus and areas of administration. The title of the Minister has changed according to the changes in the name of the Ministry.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Nongkynrih was born in [[Meghalaya]], a north-eastern state of India to AH Scott Lyngdoh, a former state minister of Meghalaya and Elvirial Nongkynrih. He is staying in Pohkseh. He is the first professional musician of his family. Introduced to [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]] by his grand-aunt, Nongkynrih learnt most of his initial lessons from his sister Pauline Nongkynrih, a jazz musician. In 1988 Nongkynrih left for [[Great Britain]] as a young man to study music, against the wishes of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/bach-in-the-hills/505101 |title=Bach in the hills |publisher=[[The Indian Express]] |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music career===
Nongkynrih studied music at [[Trinity College of Music|Trinity College]] and [[Guildhall School of Music]] in [[London]]. He did numerous shows as a concert pianist in [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/beyond-the-chamber/article2702491.ece |title=Beyond the chamber |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=2011-12-10 |accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the concerts, Nongkynrih was also teaching music in [[Oxfordshire]]. One of his many successful pupils is [[Phillip Selway]], member of the popular [[United Kingdom|British]] band [[Radiohead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-school.org/our-community/alumni/alumni-achievers/465.html |title=Neil Nongkynrih |publisher=British-school.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714223027/http://www.british-school.org/our-community/alumni/alumni-achievers/465.html |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Nongkynrih returned to India and started teaching [[piano]] in Shillong. In the same year he founded the Shillong Chamber Choir.  His lead singers are Ibarisha Lyngdoh and William Basaiawmoit .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/all-together-now-and-with-feeling |title=All Together Now And With Feeling |publisher=[[Tehelka]] |date=2010-10-16 |accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nongkynrih is trying to revive the [[Khasi language]] with a Khasi opera.

Based in Shillong, Shillong Chamber Choir (SCC) is an Indian chamber choir founded in 2001 by Nongkynrih. The choir shot to fame after it won the reality talent show, India's Got Talent (Season 2) in October 2010, on [[Colors TV]], part of the [[Got Talent]] franchise, where it performed western chorals, as well as choral-style revamps of [[Hindi]] film ([[Bollywood]]) classics. The choir participated in the 6th [[World Choir Games]] held at [[Shaoxing]] [[China]] ([[Shanghai]]) in July 2010 and was awarded Gold in all three categories - Musica Sacra, Gospel and Popular. The SCC has performed extensively in India and toured [[Europe]], [[Canada]], [[North America]] and [[South East Asia]]. The choir also performed for [[US President]] [[Barack Obama]] when he visited India in 2010. SCC has been featured as a study chapter in the English Syllabus of the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]] (ICSE) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/shillong-choir-hits-high-note--wins-contest---and-many-hearts/692083 |title=Shillong Choir hits high note, wins contest – and many hearts |publisher=[[The Indian Express]] |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter G. Rivière''' (born 1934) is a [[social anthropology|British social anthropologist]], Emeritus Professor of [[Oxford University]] and, with [[Audrey Butt Colson]], a pioneer in the study and teaching of [[Amazonian Indian|Amazonian peoples]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/about-us/affiliates-emeriti-research-fellows/prof-peter-riviere/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957-8 he took part in the [[Oxford and Cambridge Expedition to South America]].&lt;ref name=SAME&gt;{{cite news|title= Professor Peter Rivière|url=http://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/about-us/affiliates-emeriti-research-fellows/prof-peter-riviere/ |accessdate=21 January 2014|work=Oxford University School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and career ==
He completed a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil in Social Anthropology]] at Oxford in 1965, and taught there from 1971 until his retirement, in 2001. He was part of young generation of anthropologists who set new, professional standards of ethnography in Amazonia.&lt;ref name="Rival, L &amp; N Whitehead 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rival, L &amp; N Whitehead|title=Beyond the visible and the material|year=2001|publisher=OUP|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conducted extensive fieldwork among the [[Tiriyo]] of Surinam&lt;ref&gt;Rivière, P. 1969. Marriage among the Trio: a principle of social organisation. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rivière, P. 1983-84. Aspects of Carib political economy. Antropológica 59-62: 349-358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rivière, P 1984"&gt;Rivière, P. 1984. Individual and society in Guiana: a comparative study of Amerindian social organization. Cambridge: University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and among cattle ranchers of the Brazilian frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Rivière, P. 2000. Indians and cowboys: two field experiences. In ''Anthropologists in a wider world,'' edited by Paul Dresch, Wendy James and David Parkin.&lt;/ref&gt;

His book, ''Individual and Society in Guiana'',&lt;ref name="Rivière, P 1984"/&gt; today considered a classic of modern Amerindian anthropology, was regarded as "the most elegant summary and review of the central findings and debates in the ethnography of the Amerindian peoples of Guiana over the last three decades."&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, N.L. 1986. Book Review. Bulletin of Latin American Research, 5(1): 154"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a group of his former students, today well established scholars in several major universities, edited a book celebrating his contributions to the field, where they underscored that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[His] commitment to and interest in the particularities of Amazonian social processes, is not an abstract interest in the 'particular', understood as a theoretical commitment in the manner of the [[Boasians]]. Rather, the particular is important as a means to connect theory, methodology, and context. Lowland South American groups are not bearers of distinctive traits to be inventoried and classified, but organized totalities responding to specific social rules, laws, and constraints. Interest in the particular, therefore, results from an appreciation of the necessity of accurate scholarship, no less than brave new worlds of theory, as Rivière's work on the dialectical relationship between cosmological schemas and forms of social organization demonstrates. &lt;ref name="Rival, L &amp; N Whitehead 2001"/&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In recent years, his work has turned more historical. He edited reprints of the Victorian classics by John McLennan and John Lubbock for the University of Chicago and a collection on the [http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=RiviereHistory history of Oxford anthropology] (2007, 2009). He also published a book on the frontier dispute between Great Britain and Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rivière|first=Peter|title=Absent-minded imperialism|year=1995|publisher=Tauris|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and edited two volumes of Robert Schomburgk’s Guiana travels in 1835-44 for the [[Hakluyt Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rivière (ed.), The Guiana Travels of [[Robert Schomburgk]] 1835-1844, 2 vols (Aldershot: Ashgate for the Hakluyt Society, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Pinot’s Palette customers are women.&lt;ref name=HBJ2014/&gt;

As of January 2018, Pinot’s Palette has over 140 stores in 31 states, plus one location in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinotspalette.com/locations|title=Find Paint &amp; Sip Studio Near Me - Wine and Painting Near Me|last=Palette|first=Pinot's|website=Pinot's Palette|language=en|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Pinot’s Palette was founded in 2009 by business partners Craig Ceccanti, Charles Willis, and Beth Willis. Ceccanti says he got the idea for starting the business after he attended a painting class in Louisiana with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zucker|first=Shaina|title=Face to Face with Pinot’s Palette CEO Craig Ceccanti|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/print-edition/2013/03/22/face-to-facw-with-craig-ceccanti-ceo.html|work=Houston Business Journal|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Pinot’s Palette studio opened in Houston’s [[Montrose, Houston|Montrose]] neighborhood in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=Kyrie|title=Paint. Drink wine.

After opening two additional locations in the Houston area, the company began franchising. The first franchised Pinot’s Palette studio opened in [[Katy, Texas]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=HBJ2014/&gt; Since then, the company has expanded nationwide.&lt;ref name=WSJ2014/&gt;

In June 2016, Pinot’s Palette launched a rebranding effort, which introduced a new logo, and updated studio décor.&lt;ref name=Mckinney&gt;McKinney, Jeffrey [http://www.franchisetimes.com/October-2016/What-to-do-when-your--brand-needs-a-facelift/ “What to do when your brand needs a facelift”] Franchise Times. 09-21-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations and Financials==
Pinot’s Palette offers two- or three-hour group painting classes accompanied by wine or cocktails.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pinot's Palette Masters the Art of Custom Technology Solutions|journal=Franchising USA|date=January 2013|issue=3|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on state liquor laws, customers can either bring their own wine or alcoholic beverages or purchase them on-site. The company also offers corporate events and private parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Daniel P.|title=LSU’s Fun-infused Culture Spurs Grads’ Entrepreneurial Concept|url=http://www.lsualumni.org/news/LSUs-Fun-infused-Culture-Spurs-Grads-Entrepreneurial-Concept|work=LSU Alumni Association|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Pinots Palette Class.JPG|thumb|A painting class at Pinot's Palette]]
Start-up cost for a Pinot’s Palette franchise is around $100,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The company does not require franchisees to have backgrounds in wine or art.&lt;ref name=HBJ2014/&gt;

'''''Pocket Planes''''' is a business [[simulation video game]] developed by [[NimbleBit]] for [[iOS]]. It was initially released on June 14, 2012. In October 2012, the game became available on the [[Mac App Store]]. An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version, [[porting|ported]] and published by [[Mobage]], was released on September 22, 2012. The game was removed on September 24, 2015 from the [[Google Play|Google Play Store]] but is still available on [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]]. The app has also been removed from the U.K. [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]] but is still available on the U.S App Store.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Pocket Planes Gameplay Screenshot.jpg|thumb|A screenshot depicting a plane that has landed at an airport.|alt=A screenshot depicting a plane that has landed at an airport.|275x275px]]
In ''Pocket Planes'', players assume the role of an [[airline]] CEO. Starting with a few airports and small planes, players transport small amounts of [[cargo]] and [[passenger]]s short distances. As they slowly gain profit from their flights, they then build more airports, buy better planes, and expand their airline internationally.&lt;ref name=wiredrigneynofly&gt;{{cite web|last=Rigney|first=Ryan|title=Review: Pocket Planes‘ Airy Gameplay Doesn’t Fly|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/06/review-pocket-planes-airy-gameplay-doesnt-fly/|work=Wired: Game{{!}}Life|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A formula determines how much profit will be earned from a flight, depending on the distance, speed and the weight of the plane used on the route. Filling a plane with items or people going to the same destination will net a 25% bonus on each item. Players can also complete events that involve flying special items and people to a designated destination. After completing these events, players are awarded Bux, which are used to buy planes and purchase other perks such as upgrades and the ability to speed up flights.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Shutdown for Android==
On September 24, 2015, the company that ported the game to Android, [[Mobage]], shut down their game servers for Pocket Planes and other NimbleBit games including [[Pocket Frogs]] and [[Tiny Tower]], and subsequently removed these downloads from the [[Google Play Store]]. There are no plans to bring it back, and the data from the Android game cannot be transferred to the iOS version. NimbleBit has announced that future sequels or a major update may see a re-release for the game to Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.nimblebit.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2103500-android-version-shutdown|title=Android Version Shutdown|publisher=NimbleBit Support Center|date=4 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505103256/http://support.nimblebit.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2103500-android-version-shutdown|archive-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.nimblebit.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2215443-where-did-pocket-planes-for-android-go-|title=Where Did Pocket Planes for Android Go?|publisher=NimbleBit Support Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was viewed favourably by reviewers.

However, Ryan Rigney of [[Wired (website)|''Wired'']] wrote that the player's success did not correlate with skill, and criticises it for a lack of compelling gameplay.&lt;ref name=wiredrigneynofly/&gt;

'''Qualified teacher status''' ('''QTS or QTLS''') is required in [[England]] and [[Wales]] to work as a [[teacher]] of children in [[public education|state schools]] under [[local authority]] control, and in [[special education]] schools. A similar status exists under a different name in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

==Gaining QTS==
An [[undergraduate degree]] and successful completion of a teacher training programme is compulsory for QTS recommendation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} One of the main routes to achieving QTS, for those already in possession of a degree, involves undertaking a postgraduate teacher training course, such as the [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE), or a School Direct programme. There are also some undergraduate degree qualifications leading to QTS, such as the [[Bachelor of Education]]. In [[England]] only, candidates must also pass [[QTS Skills Tests|professional skills tests]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://qtsskillstests.com/about/|title=About {{!}} QTS Skills Tests|work=QTS Skills Tests|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; All candidates must have [[GCSE]]s at grade C or above in English and mathematics, and prospective primary teachers must also be in possession of (usually) a grade C in a science subject before embarking on teacher training.

All training which leads to qualified teacher status requires trainees to train across at least two key consecutive pupil age ranges, as defined in the Secretary of State's Requirements for Initial Teacher Training.&lt;ref name="tda"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tda.gov.uk/partners/ittstandards/guidance_08/itt/R2_7.aspx|title=ITT requirements guidance|accessdate=2008-05-07|publisher=Training &amp; Development Agency for Schools|work=TDA website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age ranges are:

*Ages 3–5    (Early years foundation stage)
*Ages 5–7    (School years 1 and 2)	
*Ages 7–9    (School years 3 and 4)
*Ages 9–11   (School years 5 and 6)
*Ages 11–14  (School years 7 to 9)	
*Ages 14–16  (School years 10 and 11)
*Ages 16–19  (School years 12 and 13)
 
The [[Teaching Regulation Agency]] in England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/teaching-regulation-agency/about|website=Teaching Regulation Agency|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[General Teaching Council for Wales]] maintain all registrations, as well as issuing QTS certificates.

QTS is technically recognised only in the country it was awarded (England or Wales), but teachers can normally apply for QTS in other Home Countries relatively easily. QTS is also recognised by many other countries once the relevant paperwork has been completed, though many countries place a lot of importance on the route to QTS (such as requiring a PGCE, whilst not accepting the GTP). Teachers trained outside England and Wales must also apply to be awarded QTS if they wish to teach in these countries.

After having been awarded QTS teachers must normally still pass an [[Induction (teachers)|induction period]] (previously called 'probation') &amp;ndash; normally their first year of teaching. Teachers who have gained QTS but have not yet completed the Induction period are known as [[Newly Qualified Teacher|NQT]]s. NQTs who fail the induction still retain their QTS, but cannot teach in state-run schools. The induction period normally lasts a year (three school terms).

Not all [[European Union]] qualifications have been officially recognized yet, so one should confirm with one's education establishment as to whether one's qualifications are acceptable, or whether one needs to go through the recognition process.

===Routes to QTS===
Many different qualifications and courses lead to QTS:

====Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE)====
{{main|Postgraduate Certificate in Education}}
The PGCE is a one-year course for existing degree holders, and the most common postgraduate route into teaching. It is based at and coordinated by a [[university]] or other [[higher education]] institution, though students spend a large proportion of the course working in placement schools. The PGCE carries credits towards a [[master's degree]].

====School-Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT)====
{{main|School-Centred Initial Teacher Training}}
A SCITT programme enables graduates to undertake their training within a school environment, leading to QTS. Some SCITT programmes also award a PGCE qualification. It is available in England only.

====Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) ====
{{main|Graduate Teacher Programme}}
The GTP enables candidates to gain QTS while they are employed as an unqualified teacher in a school.

Both the graduate and registered teacher programmes (GTP and RTP) have been closed in England. The graduate teacher programme (GTP) has been replaced by the School Direct Training Programme (salaried).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://targetcourses.co.uk/study-areas/teaching/teacher-training-options}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Undergraduate QTS routes====
Students can take a three or four-year [[undergraduate degree]] course that includes QTS. This enables a candidate to gain their QTS while they study for their degree, with teaching practice being undertaken over the course of the whole programme. These are usually [[Bachelor of Education]] (BEd) degrees, though some are [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) and [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc) degrees.

==Scotland and Northern Ireland==
QTS as such does not exist in Scotland or Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=J Hobson|first1=Andrew|last2=Tracey|first2=Louise|last3=Malderez|first3=Angi|title=Navigating Initial Teacher Training: Becoming a Teacher|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317723929|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as is the case in England and Wales, all teachers in Scotland and Northern Ireland are required to register with either the [[General Teaching Council for Scotland]] or the [[General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland]]; the General Teaching Councils will consider only [[graduation|graduate]]s with [[teaching qualification]]s (such as a [[Bachelor of Education|BEd]], [[Professional Graduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] or [[Professional Graduate Diploma in Education|PGDE]]) for registration.

In Northern Ireland, a one-year Induction programme (equivalent to the NQT programme in England and Wales) must be completed.

In Scotland, a one-year probation period (equivalent to induction in England and Wales) must be completed.

Those holding English or Welsh QTS (or an equivalent from another country) must apply for registration with the relevant General Teaching Council. Each case is considered individually;  even those with English or Welsh QTS are not guaranteed to be allowed to teach in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

== Schools not requiring QTS for teachers ==

There is no formal requirement for teachers at [[independent schools]] to have QTS.

As of 27 July 2012, there is no longer any requirement for teaching staff in [[Academy (English school)|academies]] to have QTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22683">'''Reciprocal teaching''' is an instructional activity that takes the form of a dialogue between teachers and students regarding segments of text for the purpose of constructing the meaning of text. Reciprocal teaching is a reading technique which is thought to promote students' reading comprehension.  A reciprocal approach provides students with four specific reading strategies that are actively and consciously used to support comprehension: Questioning, Clarifying, Summarizing, and Predicting. Palincsar (1986) believes the purpose of reciprocal teaching is to facilitate a group effort between teacher and students as well as among students in the task of bringing meaning to the text.&lt;ref&gt;Palincsar, A.S. (1986). Reciprocal teaching. In Teaching reading as thinking. Oak Brook, IL: North Central Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Reciprocal teaching is best represented as a dialogue between teachers and students in which participants take turns assuming the role of teacher.&lt;ref&gt;DeVillar, R. A., &amp; Faltis, C. (1991). Organizing the classroom for communication and learning. ''Computers and cultural diversity: Restructuring for school success'' (p. 9). Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; -Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reciprocal teaching is most effective in the context of small-group collaborative investigation, which is maintained by the teacher or reading tutor.

== Conceptual underpinnings ==
The concept of reciprocal teaching was first developed by Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar and Ann L. Brown in 1986 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stricklin|first=Kelly|title=Hands-On Reciprocal Teaching: A Comprehension Technique|journal=The Reading Teacher|year=2011|volume=64|issue=8|doi=10.1598/RT.64.8.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As previously mentioned, reciprocal teaching was developed as a technique to help teachers bridge the gap for students who demonstrated a discrepancy between [[phonics|decoding]] skills and [[reading comprehension|comprehension]] skills (Palincsar, Ransom, &amp; Derber, 1989). That is, the process is aimed at aiding students who possess grade-level skills in letter-sound correspondence ("sounding out" words and "chunking"), but are unable to construct meaning from the texts they decode. Reciprocal teaching utilizes the strategy of prediction, whereby students predict before reading, and then use those predictions during reading to check if they are correct (Stricklin, 2011). 

Reciprocal teaching is made up of four components: predicting, clarifying, questioning, and comprehension. In 2005, [http://www.reading.org/General/Publications/Books/bk507.aspx Oczkus] coined the phrase the "fab four" to describe the processes involved with reciprocal teaching (Stricklin, 2011). Students then move on to clarifying things they do not understand by asking the instructor questions, or having the teacher ask questions during reading, in order to clarify difficult sections of text or point out areas where students should pay particular attention. After the text is read, questions are asked of a student or group of students to enhance retention and check how much was learned. Finally, comprehension is achieved by engaging the students in a summary of either a page or the entire text selection of what they just read (Stricklin, 2011). The teacher supports the students by rephrasing or elaborating on their answers, statements, and questions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenshine, B. &amp; Meister, C. (1994). Reciprocal Teaching: A review of the research. ''Review of Educational Research. 64''(4)479-530.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of reading strategies ==
Reciprocal teaching is an amalgamation of reading strategies that effective readers are thought to use. As stated by Pilonieta and Medina in their article  "Reciprocal Teaching for the Primary Grades: We Can Do It, Too!", previous research conducted by Kincade and Beach (1996) indicates that proficient readers use specific comprehension strategies in their reading tasks, while poor readers do not (Pilonieta &amp; Medina, 2009). Proficient readers have well-practiced decoding and comprehension skills which allow them to proceed through texts somewhat automatically until some sort of triggering event alerts them to a comprehension failure (Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984).

This trigger can be anything from an unacceptable accumulation of unknown concepts to an expectation that has not been fulfilled by the text. Whatever the trigger, proficient readers react to a comprehension breakdown by using a number of strategies in a planned, deliberate manner. These "fix-up" strategies range from simply slowing down the rate of reading or decoding, to re-reading, to consciously summarizing the material. Once the strategy (or strategies) has helped to restore meaning in the text, the successful reader can proceed again without conscious use of the strategy (Palincsar &amp; Brown).

All readers—no matter how skilled—occasionally reach cognitive failure when reading texts that are challenging, unfamiliar, or "inconsiderate"—i.e. structured or written in an unusual manner (Garner, 1992; Wade, 2001).  Poor readers, on the other hand, do not demonstrate the same reaction when comprehension failure occurs. Some simply do not recognize the triggers that signal comprehension breakdown. Others are conscious that they do not understand the text, but do not have or are unable to employ strategies that help. Some use maladaptive strategies (such as avoidance) that do not aid in comprehension (Garner, 1992).  Mayer notes in his paper on Learning Strategies that reciprocal teaching can help even novice learners become more adept at utilizing learning strategies and furthering their understanding of a subject (1996). Mayer also notes that the reciprocal teaching process gives the students the chance to learn more by having the teachers as role models, and that the reciprocal teaching process gives beginners in an academic field a chance to learn from the experts by taking turns leading the class (Mayer, 1996).

== Reciprocal teaching strategies ==
Approaching the problem from the perspective of Cognitive Strategy Instruction (Slater &amp; Horstman, 2002), reciprocal teaching attempts to train students in specific and discrete strategies to prevent cognitive failure during reading. Palincsar and Brown (1984) identified four basic strategies that may help students recognize and react to signs of comprehension breakdown: Questioning, Clarifying, Summarizing, and Predicting. These strategies serve dual purposes of being both comprehension-fostering and comprehension-monitoring; that is, they are thought to enhance comprehension while at the same time affording students the opportunity to check whether it is occurring. The leader follows these four steps in this specific order:

=== Predicting ===
The prediction phase involves readers in actively combining their own background knowledge with what they have gathered from the text. With a narrative text students imagine what might happen next. With an informational text, students predict what they might learn or read about in subsequent passages.

Predicting involves combining the reader’s prior knowledge, new knowledge from the text, and the text’s structure to create hypotheses related to the direction of the text and the author’s intent in writing. Predicting provides an overall rationale for reading – to confirm or disconfirm self-generated hypotheses (Doolittle et al., 2006).

The ''Predictor'' can offer predictions about what the author will tell the group next or, if it's a literary selection, the predictor might suggest what the next events in the story will be. As Williams points out, predictions don't necessarily need to be accurate, but they need to be clear (2011). 

The sequence of reading, questioning, clarifying, summarizing, and predicting is then repeated with subsequent sections of text.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, W. H., &amp; Horstman, F. R. (2002). Teaching reading and writing to struggling middle school and high school students: The case for reciprocal teaching. ''Preventing School Failure'', 46(4), 163.&lt;/ref&gt;
Different reading strategies have been incorporated into the reciprocal teaching format by other practitioners. Some other reading strategies include visualizing, making connections, inferencing, and questioning the author.

=== Questioning ===
When using the questioning strategy, readers monitor and assess their own understanding of the text by asking themselves questions. This self-awareness of one's own internal thought process is termed "[[metacognition]]."

Questioning involves the identification of information, themes, and ideas that are central and important enough to warrant further consideration. The central or important information, themes, or ideas are used to generate questions that are then used as self-tests for the reader. Questioning provides a context for exploring the text more deeply and assuring the construction of meaning (Doolittle, Hicks, Triplett, Nichols, &amp; Young, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Doolittle, P.E., Hicks,D., Triplett, C.F., Nichols,W.D., &amp; Young, C.A. (2006). Reciprocal teaching for reading comprehension in higher education: A strategy for fostering the deeper understanding of texts. International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education. 17(2), 106-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Questioner'' will pose questions about the selection:
* Unclear parts
* Puzzling information
* Connections to other concepts already learned

=== Clarifying ===
The clarification strategy focuses on training students in specific steps to help with decoding (letter-sound correspondence, "[[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]," spelling, etc.), as well as fix-up strategies to deal with difficult vocabulary and lapses in concentration.

Clarifying involves the identification and clarification of unclear, difficult, or unfamiliar aspects of a text. These aspects may include awkward sentence or passage structure, unfamiliar vocabulary, unclear references, or obscure concepts. Clarifying provides the motivation to remediate confusion through re-reading, the use of context in which the text was written and/or read, and the use of external resources (e.g., dictionary or thesaurus) (Doolittle et al., 2006).

The ''Clarifier'' will address confusing parts and attempt to answer the questions that were just posed.

=== Summarizing ===
Summarization requires the reader to perform the task of discriminating between important and less-important information in the text. It must then be organized into a coherent whole (Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984).

Summarizing is the process of identifying the important information, themes, and ideas within a text and integrating these into a clear and concise statement that communicates the essential meaning of the text. Summarizing may be based on a single paragraph, a section of text, or an entire passage. Summarizing provides the impetus to create a context for understanding the specifics of a text (Doolittle et al., 2006).

The ''Summarizer'' will use his/her own words to tell the main idea of the text. This can happen anywhere in the story, and it should happen often for those students who are at-risk. It can happen first at sentence level, then paragraphs, then to whole text.

== Instructional format ==
Reciprocal teaching follows a dialogic/dialectic process. Palincsar, Ransom, and Derber (1989) wrote that there were two reasons for choosing dialogue as the medium. First, it is a language format with which children are familiar (as opposed to writing, which may be too difficult for some struggling readers). Second, dialogue provides a useful vehicle for alternating control between teacher and students in a systematic and purposeful manner.

Reciprocal teaching illustrates a number of unique ideas for teaching and learning and is based on both developmental and cognitive theories.  The strategies embedded in reciprocal teaching represent those that successful learners engage in while interacting with text.  They are thought to encourage self-regulation and self-monitoring and promote intentional learning (Brown, 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A. L. (1980). Metacognitive development and reading. In R. S. Spiro, B. B. Bruce, &amp; W. L. Brewer (Eds.), Theoretical issues in reading comprehension. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocal teaching also follows a very scaffolded curve, beginning with high levels of teacher instruction, modeling, and input, which is gradually withdrawn to the point that students are able to use the strategies independently. Reciprocal teaching begins with the students and teacher reading a short piece of text together. In the beginning stages, the teacher models the "Fab Four" strategies required by reciprocal teaching, and teacher and students share in conversation to come to a mutual agreement about the text (Williams, 2011). The teacher then specifically and explicitly models his or her thinking processes out loud, using each of the four reading strategies. Students follow the teacher's model with their own strategies, also verbalizing their thought processes for the other students to hear.

Over time, the teacher models less and less frequently as students become more adept and confident with the strategies. Eventually, responsibility for leading the small-group discussions of the text and the strategies is handed over to the students. This gives the teacher or reading tutor the opportunity to diagnose strengths, weaknesses, misconceptions, and to provide follow-up as needed.

Reciprocal teaching encompasses several techniques involving the who, what, and where, of learning (Mayer, 475-476):&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E. (2008). Learning and instruction. (2 ed.) Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
* What is learned are cognitive strategies for reading comprehension rather than specific facts and procedures. The teaching focuses on how to learn rather than what to learn.
* Learning of the cognitive strategies occurs within real reading comprehension tasks rather than having each strategy taught in isolation. Learning takes place in an order, rather than learning everything separately.
* Students learn as apprentices within a cooperative learning group that is working together on a task. The students are learning through themselves, and through the others in their group.

== Current uses ==
The reciprocal teaching model has been in use for the past 20 years (Williams, 2011) and has been adopted by a number of school districts and reading intervention programs across the United States and Canada. It has also been used as the model for a number of commercially produced reading programs such as Soar to Success, Connectors, Into Connectors
. Unfortunately, according to Williams, most students and teachers in this country have "never even heard of it" (2011).  Available from Global Ed in New Zealand, written by Jill Eggleton is the Connectors and Into Connectors Series.  These two series have both non fiction and fiction text. (2015) Abrams Learning Trends publishers ''Key Links Peer Readers'' by Jill Eggleton (2016)

Reciprocal teaching is also being adopted and researched in countries other than the United States. For example, Yu-Fen Yang of Taiwan conducted a study to develop a reciprocal teaching/learning strategy in remedial English reading classes (2010). Yang's study concluded that 
"...students expressed that they observed and learned from the teacher’s or their peers’ externalization of strategy usage. Students’ reading progress in the remedial instruction incorporating the RT system was also identified by the pre- and post-tests. This study suggests that there may be benefits for teachers in encouraging students to interact with others in order to clarify and discuss comprehension questions and constantly monitor and regulate their own reading" (2010).

In a 2008 study presented effective implementation of reciprocal teaching to students diagnosed with mild to moderate forms of disability. Within this group, ten percent of students had difficulty in learning due to Down Syndrome. The average of the participants was around eighteen years of age. The researchers, Miriam Alfassi, Itzhak Weiss, and Hefziba Lifshitz, developed a study based on Palincsar and Brown's design of reciprocal teaching for students who were considered academically too low for the complex skills of reading comprehension. The study compared two styles of teaching, remediation/direct instruction to Palincsar/Brown reciprocal teaching. After twelve weeks of instruction and assessments, reciprocal teaching was found to produce a greater success rate in improving the literacy skills in the participants with mild to moderate learning disabilities. After the study was completed, researchers recommended reciprocal teaching so that students are taught in an interactive environment that includes meaningful and connected texts. This research for the European Journal of Special Needs Education, promotes reciprocal teaching for its structure in dialogues and how students learn to apply those dialogues based on the reading taking place in instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Alfassi,Miriam; Weiss,Itzhak; Lifshitz,Hefziba. (2008) The efficacy of reciprocal teaching in fostering the reading literacy of students with intellectual disabilities. Oxford: Routledge Taylor &amp; Frances Group&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in the United States research has also been conducted on the use of reciprocal teaching in primary grades. Pilonieta and Medina conducted a series of procedures to implement their version of reciprocal teaching in elementary school students (2009). The researchers adopted an age-appropriate model for reciprocal teaching and called it "Reciprocal Teaching for the Primary Grades," or RTPG (2009). Their research shows that even in younger children, reciprocal teaching apparently benefited the students and they showed retention of the RTPG when re-tested 6 months later (2009).

Reciprocal teaching has been heralded as effective in helping students improve their reading ability in pre-post trials or research studies (Pearson &amp; Doyle, 1987; Pressley et al., 1987)&lt;ref&gt;Carter, C. (1997). Why reciprocal teaching? ''Educational Leadership. 54''64.&lt;/ref&gt; Further trials employing Reciprocal Teaching have consistently indicated the technique promotes reading comprehension as measured on standardized reading tests (Carter, 1997).

== Vygotsky connection ==
In "Thought and Language" [[Lev Vygotsky]] limns the profound connection between (oral) language,cognition and learning. Refer to ''Learning by Teaching'' for additional evidence. The intensive oral language component in Reciprocal Teaching is Vygotskian.

Reciprocal Teaching is a contemporary application of Vygotsky's theories; it is used to improve students' ability to learn from text.  In this method, teacher and students collaborate in learning and practicing four key skills: summarizing, questioning, clarifying, and predicting.  The teacher's role in the process is reduced over time.  Also, reciprocal teaching is relevant to instructional concepts such as "scaffolding" and "apprenticeship", in which a teacher or more advanced peer helps to structure or arrange a task so that a novice can work on it successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Mcleod, S. A. (2007). Simply Psychology; Vygotsky. Retrieved 6 December 2011, from http://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of this instructional method was influenced primarily by the work of Vygotsky and his notion of a “zone of proximal development,” which he characterized as “the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers” (Vygotsky, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;86).&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky. L. S. (1978). Mind in society: The development of the higher psychological processes. Cambridge, MA: The Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The assistance provided the learner is a good example of scaffolding in that both temporary and adjusted support is provided, according to the needs of the participants.  The assistance is withdrawn when it is no longer needed.  The sequence of teacher modeling, coaching, and then fading also provides an excellent example of the structure of a cognitive apprenticeship as outlined by Collins, Brown, and Newman (1989).&lt;ref&gt;Collins, A., Brown, J. S., &amp; Newman, S. (1989). Cognitive apprenticeship: Teaching the craft of reading, writing, and mathematics. In L. Resnick (Ed.), Knowing, learning and instruction: Essays in honor of Robert Glaserm, 453-494.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undergraduate and post-doctoral level==
Although a research assistant is normally appointed at graduate level, undergraduates are also sometimes appointed to support research. 

Similarly, someone who has recently been awarded a doctoral degree may hold a temporary appointment as a ''[[Postdoctoral research|postdoctoral research assistant]]''.

==Clinical research assistant==
A '''clinical research assistant''' is employed by a hospital or medical research centre, who is involved in the administration of [[clinical trials]].  He or she  may assist a senior investigator with recruiting and enrolling research subjects, as well as with correspondence and grant applications.

'''School Captain''' or '''School Pupil Leader''' is a [[student]] appointed or [[election|elected]] to lead the student body of a school. 

It is similar to "[[Student Body President]]" in the [[United States]], it is the senior representative of a school's pupils, and the school, in the community.

School captains are mainly found in [[British Empire]] legacy school systems:  [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Zimbabwe]]. 

In the election the students perform a speech in front of the school and tell the audience about their involvement and personal qualities, the students (audience) are asked to vote who they think the position should go to, but in some cases the teachers have the final decision due to the student thinking it is a popularity contest so the school knows the student can represent the school with success and ultimate behaviour.

==Role and Responsibilities==
The school captain can act as a liaison between the students at large and the faculty staff, and between the school and the community. The captain may also represent the school in sporting events against other schools, this is more common with private schools.The responsibilities of a school captain are:
- serving as a good role model for the other students
- speaking at formal occasions and assemblies


Usually, School Captains are appointed with a badge, one that is evidence of their status.

== History ==
School Stream was founded by Melissa Bridson in 2013.&lt;ref name="Motherpedia"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.motherpedia.com.au/latest-columns/article/Melissa%20Bridson/6021|title = Melissa Bridson|accessdate = 2014-07-08|year = 2014|publisher = motherpedia.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app was officially launched in late 2013&lt;ref name="Motherpedia"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.motherpedia.com.au/article/blogs/67916/a-light-bulb-moment-that-could-help-all-parents|title = The lightbuld moment that could help all parents|accessdate = 2014-07-08|year = 2014|publisher = motherpedia.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly gained media attention throughout the first half of 2014.&lt;ref name="Herald Sun"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/technology/smartphones/school-stream-smartphone-app-makes-life-easier-for-parents-says-creator-melissa-bridson/story-fni0c1du-1226896042464?nk=33af714d2f0f21a674b3c1642888d938|title = School Stream smartphone app makes life easier for parents says creator|accessdate = 2014-07-08|year = 2014|publisher = Herald Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app has also been the subject of scrutiny by the Education Review at the parent-teacher app conference. As of June 2014, the app was being rolled out to more than 1200 Catholic primary school principals in a bid to help cut down the amount of administrative work involved in keeping members of the Australian Catholic Primary Principals Association up to date with school related information.&lt;ref name="Education Review"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://apnedmedia.uberflip.com/i/328356/43|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140907143239/http://apnedmedia.uberflip.com/i/328356/43|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2014-09-07|title = Parent Teacher app conference|accessdate = 2014-07-08|year = 2014|publisher = Education Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School Stream has been tested by a number of different schools since its launch in 2013, including [[Preshil]] independent school in Kew,&lt;ref name="Canberra Times"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://media.canberratimes.com.au/technology/tech-talk/how-school-stream-works-for-preshil-5391892.html|title = How school stream works for Preshil|accessdate = 2014-07-08|year = 2014|publisher = canberratimes.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thornbury Primary School&lt;ref&gt;http://thornburyps.vic.edu.au/&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Thornbury, Victoria]].

== Features ==
School Stream is aimed at schools and parents of school age children, allowing both parties to keep better track of school news and information that is usually passed on from a school to a parent, via the child. The app enables schools to notify parents about general information, events and excursions, share newsletters, and send out digital permission slips.

Schools purchase a licence for the app which gives them access to all of its features. Parents can sign up for the app and access the information from multiple schools without the need for different logins&lt;ref name="news.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/school-stream-smartphone-app-makes-life-easier-for-parents-says-creator-melissa-bridson/story-fngqim8m-1226896042464|title = school stream app makes life easier for parents says creator Melissa Bridson|accessdate = 2014-07-08|year = 2014|publisher = news.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Science History Institute'''  is an institution that preserves and promotes understanding of the [[history of science]]. Located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], it includes a [[library]], [[museum]], [[archive]], research center and [[conference center]]. 

It was founded in 1982 as a joint venture of the [[American Chemical Society]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]], as the '''Center for the History of Chemistry''' ('''CHOC'''). The [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE) became a co-founder in 1984. It was renamed the '''Chemical Heritage Foundation''' ('''CHF''') in 1992, and moved two years later to the institution's current location, 315 Chestnut Street in [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City]].&lt;ref name=HistoryCHF&gt;{{cite journal|title=The History of CHF|journal=Chemical Heritage: Newsmagazine of the Chemical Heritage Foundation|date=2000-02-01|volume=18|issue=1|pages=16–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On December 1, 2015, CHF merged with the [[Life Sciences Foundation]], creating an organization that covers "the history of the life sciences and biotechnology together with the history of the chemical sciences and engineering."&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/history|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=27 March 2018|date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merger"&gt;{{cite news|title=CHF and LSF Announce Merger|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chf-and-lsf-announce-merger-300159747.html|accessdate=19 November 2016|work=PR Newswire|date=Oct 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of February 1, 2018, the organization was renamed the Science History Institute, to reflect its wider range of historical interests, from chemical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and biotechnology.&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salisbury|first1=Stephan|title=Chemical Heritage Foundation is morphing into the Science History Institute|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/arts/chemical-heritage-foundation-science-history-institute-philadelphia-20180103.html|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute focuses not only on the [[history of chemistry]] but also on the [[history of science]], the [[history of technology]], trends in [[research and development]], the impact of [[science#Science and society|science on society]], and relationships between science and art, among other subjects. It supports a community of research scholars and an oral history program.  As of 2012, it was the largest US grantor of research fellowships for the history of science.&lt;ref name=FellowshipSupport&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gussman|first1=Neil|title=A philanthropic career: Arnold Beckman and chemical heritage|journal=Chemistry in Australia|date=2012|volume=October|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/News-and-Press/ChemistryInAustralia_Oct2012_Beckman.pdf|pages=32–33|accessdate=10 March 2015|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050805/http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/News-and-Press/ChemistryInAustralia_Oct2012_Beckman.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Othmers&gt;{{cite web|title=Honoring the Othmers: Generosity, Vision, and a Transformative Gift|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/about/history/chf-founders/2013-02-14-othmer-gift.aspx|website=Chemical Heritage Foundation|accessdate=11 March 2015|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712182322/http://www.chemheritage.org/about/history/chf-founders/2013-02-14-othmer-gift.aspx |archivedate=2016-07-12|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of creating "a library of reference and a chemical museum" in the United States can be found in the Proceedings of the first meeting of the [[American Chemical Society]] in 1876.&lt;ref name=ACS1876&gt;{{cite journal|title=The American Chemical Society: Proceedings of the first meeting for organization, New York, April 6, 1876|journal=The American Chemist|date=1876|volume=7|issue=11|pages=401–402|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpMMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA402|accessdate=19 March 2015|last1=Chandler|first1=Charles Frederick|last2=Chandler|first2=William Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impetus for the creation of the Science History Institute dates to 1976, when the [[United States Bicentennial|nation's bicentennial]] and the centennial of the American Chemical Society (ACS) stimulated interest in both history and chemistry. John H. Wotiz of the Division of the History of Chemistry of the ACS organized a session on the history of chemistry as part of the ACS centennial activities and was a strong proponent of a national center for historical chemistry.&lt;ref name=Centennial&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reese|first1=K.

===Center for the History of Chemistry===
In 1979, the ACS formed a task force chaired by [[Ned D. Heindel]] to investigate the possibility of creating a national center for the history of chemistry.&lt;ref name=HistoryCHF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHOC18-3/&gt; [[Arnold Thackray]], a professor in the Department of History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania, and curator of the [[Edgar Fahs Smith]] Memorial Collection on the history of chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, argued for the formation of such a center in Philadelphia. He was able to obtain promises of private support from chemist [[John C. Haas]], and institutional support from the [[Dow Chemical Company]] and [[DuPont]].&lt;ref name=CHF-origin/&gt; In December 1981 the ACS approved the establishment of the Center for the History of Chemistry, with support of $50,000 per year for five years, in cooperation with the University of Pennsylvania, which was to provide an equivalent in goods and services.&lt;ref name=Centennial/&gt; An agreement to create the Center for the History of Chemistry was signed by officers of the American Chemical Society and the University of Pennsylvania on January 22 and 26, 1982.&lt;ref name=CHOC1-1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Center for History of Chemistry Created|journal=CHOC News|date=1982|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–3, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A policy council was appointed by the sponsoring institutions to oversee routine operations of the center, and [[Arnold Thackray]] was appointed part-time director of the center on April 29, 1982.&lt;ref name=CHOC1-1/&gt; The official inauguration of the center was held on March 11, 1983.&lt;ref name=CHOC1-3&gt;{{cite journal|title=Center for History of Chemistry Inaugurated|journal=CHOC News|date=1983|volume=1|issue=3|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center's first home was in several vacant basement rooms on the [[University of Pennsylvania]] campus.&lt;ref name=CHF-origin&gt;{{cite web|last=Gussman|first=Neil|title=The Power of John C.

A National Advisory Board was also formed from a wide-ranging group of people in academia and industry.&lt;ref name=CHOC1-1/&gt; In 1982, its members included John C. Haas, historians [[Margaret W. Rossiter]] and [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] and at least three [[Nobel Prize]] winners, [[Christian B. Anfinsen]], [[Herbert C. Brown]], and [[Glenn T.

As early as 1983, the Center for the History of Chemistry expressed an interest in "The Conservation of Historic American Chemical Instruments", in discussions of a possible joint project with the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]].  However, the center did not yet have exhibition or collections space to allow for the acquisition of any but the most limited quantities of documents.&lt;ref name=CHOC1-3b&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Conservation of Historic American Chemical Instruments|journal=CHOC News|date=1983|volume=1|issue=3|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center did curate a number of traveling exhibitions by collaborating with other organizations, including "Joseph Priestley: Enlightened Chemist",&lt;ref name=Priestley&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Priestley, enlightened chemist an exhibit celebrating the 250th birthday of Joseph Priestley|url=http://ihm.nlm.nih.gov/luna/servlet/detail/NLMNLM~1~1~101437807~151872:Joseph-Priestley,-enlightened-chemi|place=Philadelphia|publisher=Center for History of Chemistry|date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Polymers and People",&lt;ref name=Polymers&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Eric|title=Polymers and People: An Informal History|date=1986|publisher=The Center for the History of Chemistry|location=Philadelphia|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Scaling Up",&lt;ref name=SmithReview&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=John K.|title="Scaling up: Science, Engineering, and the American Chemical Industry"-Center for History of Chemistry|journal=Technology and Culture|date=1986|volume=27|issue=4|pages=832–834|jstor=3105331|doi=10.2307/3105331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scaling&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heitmann|first1=John Alfred|last2=Rhees|first2=David J.|title=Scaling up: science, engineering, and the American chemical industry|date=1990|publisher=Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania|location=Philadelphia, PA, US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "Chemical Education in the United States".&lt;ref name=Lewenstein&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewenstein|first1=Bruce V.|title="To improve our knowledge in nature and arts": A history of chemical education in the United States|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=January 1989|volume=66|issue=1|pages=37|doi=10.1021/ed066p37|bibcode=1989JChEd..66...37L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry (BCHOC)====
During the 1980s, the center came to the attention of [[Arnold Orville Beckman]]. The [[Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation]] provided a $2 million challenge grant in 1986 to stimulate expansion of the center as a research institute, the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry (BCHOC).&lt;ref name=BeckmanCHF&gt;{{cite web|title=Arnold O.

Beckman challenged the center to define its mission more broadly, reaching out to academic, professional and trade organizations, and including biochemistry, materials science, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and instrumentation within its mandate.&lt;ref name="hundred"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-941901-23-9 |author1=Arnold Thackray  |author2=Minor Myers, Jr. ; foreword by James D.

==== Othmer Library of Chemical History ====
In 1989, the Center received a further challenge grant, this time from [[Donald F. Othmer]] and his wife, Mildred Topp Othmer.  Donald Othmer was a quiet chemical engineering professor from Polytechnic University in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite news |first=Karen E. |last=Quinones Miller |title=Chemistry Foundation Here Finds Element Of Surprise A Professor Left It Millions |url=http://articles.philly.com/1998-07-14/news/25737042_1_chemical-heritage-foundation-chemical-engineering-chemistry-prize |quote=In 1982, when the Chemical Heritage Foundation was a fledgling research organization starting out with only $50,000, it asked chemical engineers and experts around the country to serve as advisers on its council of friends.

Again, efforts to match the grant were supported by the National Foundation for History of Chemistry and the American Chemical Society's Campaign for Chemistry.   The new library was further supported by the donation of 8,500 monographs, textbooks and reference works from The Chemists' Club of New York.&lt;ref name=CHOC6-2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Charles C.|title=Making History: The Challenge Met - And the Challenge Ahead |journal=The Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry News|date=1989|volume=6|issue=2|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHOC6-2b&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Donald F. &amp; Mildred Topp Othmer Library of Chemical History |journal=The Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry News|date=1989|volume=6|issue=2|page=insert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical Heritage Foundation===
On July 1, 1992, the National Foundation for History of Chemistry changed its name to the Chemical Heritage Foundation, in recognition of the international nature of chemical history.&lt;ref name=HistoryCHF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHOC9-2&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Chemical Heritage Foundation |journal=The Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry News|date=1992|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1, 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, the [[First National Bank (Philadelphia)|First National Bank]] at 315 Chestnut Street was being discussed as a possible permanent home for the Beckman Center and Othmer Library.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHOC11-2&gt;{{cite journal|title=CHF Approaches Independence |journal=Chemical Heritage|date=1992|volume=11|issue=2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution was able to purchase the bank and nearby property in 1995 in part through a matching grant from Donald Othmer.  Soon afterward, its endowment was expanded by a bequest from Othmer's estate.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;  The Chemical Heritage Foundation moved to 315 Chestnut Street on February 1, 1996.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHOC13-2&gt;{{cite journal|title=CHF on the Move! |journal=Chemical Heritage|date=1996|volume=13|issue=2|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The buildings were renovated by Richard Conway Meyer occurred in two main phases over the next few years.&lt;ref name=ChemInt1998&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Chemical Heritage Foundation: A growing resource for the chemical community|journal=Chemistry International|date=1998|volume=20|issue=1|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/1998/january/heritage.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 1, providing temporary office space and book storage, was completed in 1998.

[[File:"Old Faithful" bakelite cooker.jpg|thumb|right| "Old Faithful" bakelite cooker model, in museum]]
Acquisition of a permanent building finally made it possible for the institution to develop "a public museum and display area".&lt;ref name=CH12-2&gt;{{cite journal|title=CHF Move to Independence Park Draws Near |journal= Chemical Heritage|date=1995|volume=12|issue=2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CH13-1&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Museum of Chemical Progress: A Future Option at CHF |journal= Chemical Heritage|date=1995|volume=13|issue=1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One possible focus was the history of instrumentation. As early as 1989, the Beckman Center had requested the loan or gift of [[Beckman Instruments]] such as the Beckman [[pH meter]] and the [[DU spectrophotometer]] for display at the Center.&lt;ref name=CHOC6-3&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wanted: Beckman Instruments |journal=The Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry News|date=1989|volume=6|issue=3|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those instruments were included in an instrumentation exhibition organized by W.

Edward Brame and other members of that committee connected with Arnold Thackray and formed the nucleus of the institution's Chemical Instrumentation Museum Group (CIMG) in 1994.&lt;ref name=CHOC15-1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://images.alfresco.advanstar.com/alfresco_images/pharma/2014/08/22/5a1317cb-fafc-4c50-b557-e198e0f0fd52/article-31339.pdf |title=History of the Chemical Heritage Scientific Instrumentation Museum|first1=John R. |last1=Ferraro|first2=Edward G. |last2=Brame Jr|date=2002|volume=17|number=34|journal=Spectroscopy|accessdate=2 May 2014|quote=Note: This article predates the opening of the 2008 museum by several years; the museum exhibit discussed here was a temporary instrumentation exhibit from 2002, not the permanent museum of 2008.

=====Alchemical collections=====
The Science History Institute is particularly interested in the origins of early science and chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Neil|last= Gussman |url=http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/media/periodic-tabloid/2010-10-15-alchemy-in-the-news.aspx |title=Alchemy is Front-Page News, Again in the Science Times |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2013-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814030245/http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/media/periodic-tabloid/2010-10-15-alchemy-in-the-news.aspx|archivedate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its varied holdings have considerable depth both in alchemical books and fine-art depictions of early modern alchemists.&lt;ref name=Recipes/&gt; The institution's collection of alchemy-related artwork, one of the largest in the world, builds upon two significant collections.&lt;ref name=Australia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gussman|first1=Neil|title=Chemical heritage in the US|journal=Chemistry in Australia|date=2012|pages=18–21|volume=October |url=http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/News-and-Press/ChemistryInAustralia_Oct2012_ChemHeritage.pdf |accessdate=10 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052911/http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/News-and-Press/ChemistryInAustralia_Oct2012_ChemHeritage.pdf|archivedate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chester Garfield Fisher, founder of [[Fisher Scientific]], started collecting alchemical art in the 1920s.

=====Instrument collections=====

The Chemical Heritage Foundation's collections include such pioneering and landmark instruments as a 1934 [[Beckman Coulter|Beckman]] Model G pH Meter, a [[DuPont]] 900 Differential Thermal Analyzer, an early custom Electro-spray Ionization Mass Spectrometer used by [[John B. Fenn]],&lt;ref name="Arnaud2008" /&gt; a 1947 [[Mettler Toledo|Mettler]] B5 Single-Pan Balance, a 1963 [[Perkin-Elmer]] Model 125 Infrared Grating Spectrophotometer, and a c. 1980's Automated Peptide Synthesizer created by [[Bruce Merrifield]].&lt;ref name="Arnaud2008" /&gt;

The foundation expanded its instrument collections slowly, mostly through donations of single instruments or small groups of instruments. In 2000, the CIMG was transformed into the Heritage Council Instruments and Artifacts Committee (HCIAC), which included staff and supporters and began meeting under founding chair W. Richard Howe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W. Richard Howe|url=http://www.as.pitt.edu/about/w-richard-howe|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the institution was given hundreds of [[Scientific instrument|instruments]] by Stephen P.

In 2004, a list of "50 Instruments That Changed the World" was identified as a basis for further expansion. In 2008, the institution released a list of its ten most wanted instruments.&lt;ref name="Wanted2008"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CHF's Most Wanted|journal=Chemical Heritage|date=2008|volume=26|issue=2|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The Arnold O. Beckman Permanent Exhibit and the Clifford C. Hach Gallery =====
As early as 1996, the Chemical Heritage Foundation had envisioned a broadly-based museum of chemical progress in which instruments would have "a major, but not exclusive role".&lt;ref name=CHOC13-2b&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Museum at CHF? |journal=Chemical Heritage|date=1996|volume=13|issue=2|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; That  vision was followed when Peter Saylor of [[Charles E.

Beckman Permanent Exhibit and the Clifford C. Hach Gallery for rotating exhibitions  opened in 2008.    The [[Arnold O. Beckman]] permanent exhibition, ''Making Modernity'', was designed by [[Ralph Appelbaum Associates]].&lt;ref name=CHM2008/&gt;  It has been described as an "art gallery for science", and showcases objects from the institution's widely varying collections. "The instruments are only a fraction of the objects on display.  The exhibition also includes books, documents, and artwork from CHF's collection, as well as an array of consumer products."&lt;ref name=Arnaud2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnaud|first1=Celia Henry|title=The Art of Science: Chemical Heritage Foundation takes a new approach to science museums|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=October 27, 2008|volume=86|issue=43|pages=34–36|url=http://cen.acs.org/magazine/86/8643.html|accessdate=17 March 2015|doi=10.1021/cen-v086n043.p034}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition is organized around thematic arcs illustrative of the history of science, particularly chemistry. Displays include the influence of alchemy in early chemistry, the development of the first plastics, the development of brilliantly colored synthetic dyes, scientific advocacy for public health in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the teaching of chemistry through books and chemistry sets.&lt;ref name=CHM2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greco|first1=JoAnn|title=Making Modernity: A Gallery Preview|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=2008|volume=26|issue=1|pages=21–25| url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/making-modernity-a-gallery-preview|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science History Institute===
On December 1, 2015, the Chemical Heritage Foundation merged with the [[Life Sciences Foundation]], also founded by Arnold Thackray.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Merger"/&gt;  Recognizing that the joint organization's interests extended beyond the field of chemistry, the organization began a two-year renaming process, whose outcome required the agreement of its founding partners, the [[American Chemical Society]] and the [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]].  On February 1, 2018, the organization was renamed the Science History Institute, to reflect its wider range of historical interests, extending from the chemical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and biotechnology.&lt;ref name="Salisbury"/&gt;

===Leaders===
[[Arnold Thackray]], the institution's first president, was awarded the 1983 [[Dexter Award]] for his contributions to the history of chemistry.&lt;ref name=DexterThackray&gt;{{cite web|title=Arnold Thackray 1939–)|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/Dexter%20Papers/ThackrayDexterBioJJB.pdf|publisher=Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society|accessdate=1 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baykoucheva&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baykoucheva|first1=Svetla|title=The Chemical Heritage Foundation: Past, Present, and Future Interview with Arnold Thackray|journal=Chemical Information Bulletin|date=2008|volume=60|issue=2|pages=10–13|url=http://www.acscinf.org/content/chemical-heritage-foundation-past-present-and-future|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thackray was succeeded by [[Thomas R.

* The Othmer Library: In 2004, the Othmer Library became the steward of the Roy G. Neville Historical Chemical Library, which represents one of the most comprehensive single deposits of books on the history of chemistry in the world. Roughly 6,000 titles in all, the Neville collection comprises materials that date from the late 15th century to the early 20th century and includes many of the most important works in the history of science and technology from this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/rare-books |title=Rare Books |website= Science History Institute|date=2016-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Center for Oral History: The Center for Oral History at the Science History Institute aims to create a collection of comprehensive, professionally edited interviews with leading figures in chemistry and related fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/ |title=Center for Oral History |website= Science History Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Archives: The Science History Institute collects, preserves, describes, and makes available the unique, unpublished materials that document the past 200 years of scientific history. The Institute actively collects archival materials from outstanding scientists, industries, and professional organizations. Spanning over 5,000 linear shelf feet, these collections are a major attraction for scholars of the history of chemical and molecular sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/archives |title=Archives |website = Science History Institute |date=2016-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Photographs: The Science History Institute's Image Archive contains an extensive collection of photographic prints, negatives, and slides reflecting the chemical history of the past century. The Institute currently holds more than 20,000 images of notable chemists, laboratories, industrial scenes, historic gatherings, and chemical artifacts. These images hold considerable interest for scholars, journalists, and publishers who are active in chemistry-related fields. Informal snapshots and personal photos capture notable scientists at work and at play, such as the polymer chemists [[Wallace Carothers]] and [[Carl Shipp Marvel]] on a fishing trip and chemical engineer [[Donald Othmer]] and his wife on their wedding day. Highlights include: 
** Williams Haynes Portrait Collection: nearly 1,000 formal portraits of important chemists from the early 1900s
** Travis Hignett Collection: images from the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory (1920–1950)
** Joseph Labovsky Collection: the history of nylon
** Dow Historical Collection: 20th-century industrial images   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/photographs |title=Photographs |website= Science History Institute |date=2016-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fine Art: Strengths of the Science History Institute's fine-art collection include the Fisher Scientific International Collection and the Roy Eddleman Collection, more than 90 paintings and 200 works on paper that unmask the world of the alchemists. In their pursuit of the elusive philosophers’ stone, alchemists created a body of knowledge about the material world through experiments and lab work, setting the stage for modern chemistry. Other highlights of the fine-art collection include oil paintings depicting such early modern chemical activities as distillation and metallurgy and watercolors showing the production process of the textile [[ramie]].&lt;ref name="FA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/fine-art |title=Fine Art|website= Science History Institute |date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Artifacts: The Science History Institute collects three-dimensional artifacts to create a representative group of material-culture objects that can be used as resources for both research and exhibition. The Institute holds a variety of historical artifacts related to chemistry and chemical education, including instrumentation. It has one of the best public collections of chemistry sets, with approximately 100 different sets from all over the world, including Australia and Germany.  Other special artifact collections include The Beauty of [[Bakelite]] and Chemistry and Fashion. Highlights include the Beckman IR-1 [[spectrophotometer]], [[John Fenn (chemist)|John Fenn]]’s electrospray mass spectrometer and [[Bruce Merrifield]]’s solid-phase peptide synthesizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/objects |title=Objects | website= Science History Institute |date=2016-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary education in Japan''' is split into [[junior high school]]s (中学校 ''chūgakkō''), which cover the seventh through ninth grade, and [[senior high school]]s (高等学校 ''kōtōgakkō'', abbreviated to 高校 ''kōkō''), which mostly cover grades ten through twelve.

==Junior high school==
[[Image:Japanese Middle School.jpg|thumb|right|The courtyard and classrooms wing of [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003457/http://www3.saga-ed.jp/school/oni-tyu/ Onizuka Junior High School] (鬼塚中学校) in [[Karatsu, Saga|Karatsu]], [[Japan]]]]
[[File:Japanese_classroom.jpg|alt=Picture of a typical Japanese classroom|left|thumb|335x335px|A typical Japanese classroom]]
Lower-secondary schools cover grades seven, eight, and nine. Ages are roughly 12-15 with increased focus on academic studies. Although it is possible to leave the formal education system after completing lower secondary school and find employment, fewer than 4% did so by the late 1980s.

Most junior high schools in the 1980s were government-funded public schools; 5% were private schools. At ¥552,592 ($3,989 USD) per pupil, private schools had a per-student cost that was four times higher than public schools, at ¥130,828 ($934 USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/957970329|title=Insights from emergent education systems in selected countries : with De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde School of Multidisciplinary Studies scenarios upon full implementation of the K-12 program by 2016.|last=A.|first=Fadul, Jose|date=2011|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=9781257995219|location=Morrisville, North Carolina|oclc=957970329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum number of school days in a year is 210 in Japan, compared to 180 in the United States. However, students will typically attend school for 240 to 250 days a year. A significant part of the school calendar is taken up by non-academic events such as sports days and school trips.&lt;ref name="Shields2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=James J.|last=Shields|title=Japanese Schooling: Patterns of Socialization, Equality, and Political Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ssHlZQvhOA4C&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=16 November 2012|date=31 May 2004|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-02340-3|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers often majored in the subjects they taught. Each class is assigned a homeroom teacher who doubles as [[school counselor|counselor]]. Unlike [[Elementary school|elementary]] students, junior high school students have different teachers for different subjects. The subject teachers usually move to a new room for each 50-minute period. Usually students' lunch is provided by the school itself.

===Instruction===
[[Image:Japanese-Teacher's-Room.jpg|left|thumbnail|250px|A teachers' room at Onizuka [[Junior High School]] in [[Karatsu, Saga|Karatsu]], [[Japan]] (classes usually stay in one place and teachers move each period)]]

Instruction tends to rely on the [[lecture]] method.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Teachers also use other media, such as [[television]] and [[radio]], and there is some [[laboratory]] work. By 1989 about 45% of all public lower-secondary schools had computers, including schools that used them only for administrative purposes. Classroom organization is still based on small work groups, although no longer for reasons of discipline. Students are expected to have mastered daily routines and acceptable behavior.

All course contents are specified in the [[curriculum|Course of Study for Lower-Secondary Schools]]. Some subjects, such as [[Japanese language]] and [[mathematics]], are coordinated with the elementary [[curriculum]]. The curriculum covers Japanese language, English, social studies, mathematics, science, music, fine arts, industrial arts, homemaking, health, and physical education. [[Morality|Moral]] education and special activities continue to receive attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/article/world/85463/japan-nuclear-power-regulation With a Mighty Hand], ''New Republic'', March 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extracurricular activities===

Many students participate in after-school clubs. Sports clubs, such as [[baseball in Japan|baseball]] are especially popular among boys,&lt;ref name="web-japan.org"&gt;http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/explore/schools/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="springer.com"&gt;[https://www.springer.com/education+%26+language/book/978-94-007-2177-7 Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools] by David G. Hebert (Springer press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; while wind bands are the most popular club for girls.&lt;ref name="springer.com"/&gt; Soccer (football) clubs are gaining popularity. [[Judo]] clubs attract boys and girls. They may be inspired by the many Japanese judo athletes who have won medals at the World Judo Championships and the Olympic Games. Other popular sports clubs include tennis, basketball, gymnastics, and volleyball. In every sport, many games are held between schools and at the regional level, so students have opportunities to compete.

For cultural clubs, one that has gained popularity is the [[Go (game)|go club]]. Go is a strategic board game played with black and white stones. After a manga about the game was published (''[[Hikaru no Go]]''), more schoolchildren started enjoying go. Other options for students include choir and art clubs. Brass band, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement clubs are popular.&lt;ref name="web-japan.org"/&gt;

Some junior high schools encourage students to take academic ability tests such as the [[STEP Eiken]] for English or the [[Kanji kentei]] for Japanese.

Students in the highest grades of elementary, junior high, and senior high schools also take trips lasting up to several days to culturally important cities such as Kyoto and Nara, ski resorts, or other places.&lt;ref name="web-japan.org"/&gt;

==Senior high school==
[[File:Kanagawa highschool class.jpg|thumb|A high school class in 1963]]

Even though [[upper secondary school|upper-secondary school]] is not compulsory in Japan, as of 2005 94% of all junior high school graduates entered high schools&lt;ref&gt;STATISTICAL ABSTRACT 2006 edition&lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617061845/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/index.htm |archivedate=2008-06-17 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and over 95% of students graduated successfully from them compared to 89% of Americans.&lt;ref name="unc.edu"&gt;http://www.unc.edu/world/2006_K12Symp/Post-Program/Middle_Lesson_Plan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To enter, students must take an [[entrance examination]] in Japanese, mathematics, science, social studies, and English,&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"&gt;Marcia, Johnson L. and Jeffrey R. Johnson. "[http://www.ericdigests.org/1997-4/daily.htm Daily Life in Japanese High Schools]." ''[[ERIC Digest]]''. October 1996. [[ERIC]] Identifier: ED406301.&lt;/ref&gt; whether it is standardized for all public high schools in the prefecture or a test created by a private high school for that school alone.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; All upper-secondary schools, public and private, are informally ranked based on their success in placing graduates in freshman classes of [[List of universities in Japan#By_ranking|internationally ranked]] and [[Imperial Universities]].&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Success or failure on an entrance examination can influence a student's entire future, since the prospect of finding a good job depends on the school attended.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Thus, students experience the pressure of this examination system at a relatively early age.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Because of the importance of these exams in entering high school — even more than the scholastic record and performance evaluations from lower-secondary school — students are closely counselled in lower-secondary school so that they will be relatively assured of a place in the schools to which they apply.

===Daily life===

Students walk, ride bicycles, or take public transportation to school.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; It is not uncommon for students to spend two or more hours each day on public transportation,&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; taking time to sleep, study or socialize. What they can do on the way to and from school — chewing gum, consuming snacks, reading books while walking — anything that might reflect badly on the reputation of the school&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; is heavily regulated to protect that reputation.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Some schools even require students to leave seats open on buses and trains for other passengers "to demonstrate consideration."&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Each school has a unique uniform that makes its students easily identifiable to the public.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt;

Every high school has a set of lockers for students to exchange their street shoes for a set of slippers, which in some schools are color-coded for gender.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt;

High schools typically begin at 8:30,&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; when teachers meet for a five-minute meeting, followed by homeroom.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"&gt;http://members.tripod.com/h_javora/jed8.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Students assemble in their homerooms of an average of between 40 and 45 students each,&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; with some schools having a weekly schoolwide assembly beforehand.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Homeroom teachers are in charge of morning and afternoon homeroom times, both about five minutes each,&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"/&gt; as well as a weekly one-hour long homeroom period.&lt;ref name="Century, Miki Y 2005, p. 101"&gt;Japanese Education in the 21st Century, Miki Y. Ishikida, June 2005, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter meeting "provides an opportunity for teachers to concentrate on student guidance. Typical activities include helping students develop greater awareness of themselves as high school students, encouraging them to reflect on their summer vacations, or perhaps asking them to contemplate the forthcoming advancement from one grade to another. These discussion topics are planned by teachers and scheduled in advance for the entire school year."&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"/&gt;

During the daily homerooms the students themselves conduct what they call "toban" — taking attendance, making announcements, etc. — that are shared on a rotating basis.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Two class leaders, one male and one female are elected every trimester, and many students are assigned to specific task committees in their homeroom class.&lt;ref name="Century, Miki Y 2005, p. 101"/&gt;

Regular classes begin at 8:45 AM and there are four classes of 50 minutes each before lunch.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"/&gt; Students go to different classrooms for physical education, laboratory classes, or other specialized courses; otherwise, teachers change classrooms instead of the students for the entire day.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Students typically attend between ten and fourteen courses a year;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mangatutorials.com/tut/jschool2.php&lt;/ref&gt; however, "you don't have all of your classes every day. The schedule rotates throughout the week, and in every classroom you enter you will find a schedule taped to the wall."&lt;ref name="Century, Miki Y 2005, p. 101"/&gt;

Most schools do not have their own cafeteria,&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; students eating in their homerooms instead,&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"/&gt; and unlike elementary and middle schools high schoolers do not have government-subsidized lunches.&lt;ref name="Century, Miki Y 2005, p. 101"/&gt; Because of this many students bring a box lunch  (bento) - from home with foods such as rice, fish, eggs, vegetables, and pickles.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Century, Miki Y 2005, p. 101"/&gt;

After lunch students have two more classes.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"/&gt; All students then participate in a fifteen-minute cleaning the school ("osoji").&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Century, Miki Y 2005, p. 101"/&gt; The students work in assigned groups of between four and six students, known as han, to clean their classrooms, corridors, and school grounds.&lt;ref name="Century, Miki Y 2005, p. 101"/&gt;

After osoji and the afternoon homeroom meeting, or at 3:30 PM, students are free to attend extracurricular activities.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"/&gt;

Saturday schooling, when offered, ends at 1 PM after four courses.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"/&gt; (As discussed below, Saturday courses were officially done away with in 2002 but many schools have either kept them or are trying to bring them back).

====Extracurriculars====

In most schools, there are two types of extracurricular clubs: 
* sports clubs, such as [[baseball]], [[football]], [[judo]], [[kendo]], [[track and field|track]], [[tennis]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[softball]], [[volleyball]], and [[rugby football|rugby]];  
* culture clubs, such as [[English language|English]], [[broadcasting]], [[calligraphy]], [[science]], [[mathematics]], and [[yearbook]].&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt;

New students usually choose a club after the school year begins and only rarely change for the rest of their high school careers.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Clubs meet for two hours after school every day, many times even during school vacations.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Although there is a teacher assigned to each club as a sponsor, they often have very little input in the club's daily activities.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; These clubs are an important chance for students to make friends and learn the social etiquette and relationships like the "senpai" (senior)/"kohai" (junior) dynamic that will be important in their adult lives.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt;

However, most college bound students withdraw from club activities during their senior year to devote more time to preparation for university entrance examinations.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Homeroom teachers work with students and their parents at this time to discuss their admission prospects or career plans.&lt;ref name="Century, Miki Y 2005, p. 101"/&gt;

====Free time====

Outside of school and [[cram schools]], research done in the late 1990s showed students doing approximately two hours of homework on weekdays and about three hours of it on Sundays.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Every day students spent an average of two hours watching [[television]], 30 minutes listening to the [[radio]], an hour reading for fun, and less than half an hour hanging out with peers.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Parents and teachers strongly discourage teenage dating, and most young people do not begin to do so until after high school.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; More recently, social media such as [[Line (software)|Line]] are popular.

===Curriculum===

As of the late 1990s Japanese students spent 240 days a year at school, 60 days more than their American counterparts&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; even with the amount of time spent preparing for school festivals and events.&lt;ref name="Shields2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Traditionally Japanese students attended class on Saturdays;&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; although education reforms from 2002 have made them no longer mandatory,&lt;ref name="unc.edu"/&gt; many schools have begun to bring them back to have more time to cover the rigorous material required by the Ministry of Education.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Schools have limited autonomy in developing their curriculum or choosing their textbooks. Instead, although the latter are written and produced in the private sector,&lt;ref name="unc.edu"/&gt; the Ministry of Education has the final say over any and all content and materials.&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; Typically students take three years each of [[mathematics]], [[social studies]], [[Japanese studies|Japanese]], [[science]], and [[English as a second or foreign language|English]], with additional courses including [[physical education]], [[music]], [[art]], and moral studies.&lt;ref name="unc.edu"/&gt; In particular [[social studies]] in Japan is broken down into [[civics]], [[geography]], Japanese history, world history, [[sociology]], and [[politics]]/[[economics]].&lt;ref name="unc.edu"/&gt;

Because the amount of mandatory courses, electives are few. All the students in one grade level study the same subjects,&lt;ref name="ericdigests.org"/&gt; although it is in upper-secondary school that differences in ability are first publicly acknowledged.

Most upper-secondary teachers are university graduates. Upper-secondary schools are organized into departments, and teachers specialize in their major fields although they teach a variety of courses within their disciplines. Teaching depends largely on the lecture system, with the main goal of covering the very demanding curriculum in the time allotted. Approach and subject coverage tends to be uniform, at least in the public schools.

===Types of schools===
{{Update|section|date=January 2014}}

====General program====

The most common type of upper-secondary schools has a full-time, general program that offered academic courses for students preparing for [[higher education in Japan|higher education]].

According to 2005 research, while almost 90% of Japanese students attend public schools from kindergarten through the ninth grade, over 29% of students go to private high schools.&lt;ref name="unc.edu"/&gt; A late-1980s study by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]] had found that families paid about [[Japanese yen|¥]]300,000 (US$2,142) a year for a public high school and about twice as much for a private high school; however, as the name suggests, the 2010 "Act on Free Tuition Fee at Public High Schools and High School Enrollment Support Fund" did away with all public high school tuition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mext.go.jp/english/elsec/1303524.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being free to attend, public schools are more popular because many students and experts have found the quality of education to be much better than that at private schools.&lt;ref name=Reedp119&gt;Reed, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cXplmWOycwEC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119 119].&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this entrance exams for public high schools are much more competitive among students than their private counterparts.

Japanese [[vocational education|vocational and technical]] programs include several hundred specialized courses, such as information processing, metal works, fish farming, business English, and automotive industry. Business and industrial courses in particular accounted for 72% of all students in full-time vocational programs in 1989.

The first-year programs for students in both academic and commercial courses are similar. They include basic academic courses, such as [[Japanese language]], [[English language|English]], [[mathematics]], and [[science]].

Training of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student's disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more students with disabilities.

====Nontraditional schools====

A small number of schools offer part-time classes, [[night school]], or [[correspondence education]].

==Education reforms==
{{TIMSSScores2007}}
{{See also|Curriculum guideline|Yutori education}}

The [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) recognizes a need to improve the teaching of all [[foreign language]]s, especially English. To improve instruction in spoken [[English language|English]], the [[Government of Japan|government]] invites many young native speakers of English to Japan to serve as assistants to school [[board of education|board]]s and [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] under its [[Jet Programme|Japan Exchange and Teaching Program]]. By 2005 participants numbered over 6,000. In the last few years, several school boards in Japan have relied on ALTs ([[Assistant Language Teacher]]) from private dispatch companies.

As part of the movement to develop an integrated curriculum and the education reform movement of the late 1980s, the entire Course of Study for Lower-Secondary Schools was revised in 1989 and took effect in the 1992–93 school year. A main aim of the reform is to equip students with the basic knowledge needed for [[citizenship]]. In some measure, this means increased emphasis on [[History of Japan|Japanese history]] and [[Culture of Japan|culture]], as well as understanding Japan as a nation and its relationships with other nations of the world. The course of study also increased elective hours, recommending that electives be chosen in light of individual student differences and with an eye toward diversification.

A further revision to the [[Fundamental Law of Education]] was carried out on 22 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/lawandplan/1303462.htm|title=MEXT : Basic Act on Education (Provisional translation)|publisher=The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|accessdate=April 19, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331133057/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/lawandplan/1303462.htm|archivedate=March 31, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised law leaves the structure of schooling basically the same but includes new emphases on respect for [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] (Article 2.5), school [[discipline]] (Article 6.2), and [[parent]]al [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] (Article 10).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090220064548/http://japanfocus.org/images/UserFiles/File/2468.lebowitzMcNeill.education/ed.law.file.pdf Comparison of old and current law] on Japan Focus an Asian Pacific e-journal] accessed at December 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junior high issues===

Two problems of great concern to educators and citizens began to appear at the lower-secondary level in the 1980s: [[bullying]], which remains a major problem, and the [[school refusal|school-refusal syndrome]] (toko kyohi; manifested by excessive [[truancy|absenteeism]]), which was on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E0DA133EF931A25752C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Free to Be] by Miki Tanikawa, ''[[The New York Times]]'' January 12, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, there were 42,754 incidents of problematic behavior in junior high schools, according to a government survey.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' 2/12/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts disagreed over the specific causes of these phenomena, but there is general agreement that the system offers little individualized or specialized assistance, thus contributing to disaffection among those who can not conform to its demands or who are otherwise experiencing difficulties. Another problem concerns Japanese children returning from abroad. These students, particularly if they have been overseas for extended periods, often need help in reading and writing — and in adjusting to rigid classroom demands. Even making the adjustment does not guarantee acceptance. Besides having acquired a foreign language, many of these students have also acquired foreign customs of speech, dress, and behavior that mark them as different.

===Senior high issues===

The upper-secondary curriculum underwent thorough revision in 1989. That year a new [[Course of Study for Upper-Secondary Schools]] was announced that was to be phased in beginning with the tenth grade in 1994, followed by the eleventh grade in 1995 and the twelfth grade in 1996. Among noteworthy changes is the requirement that male and female students take a course in [[Family and consumer science|home economics]]. The government is concerned with instilling in all students an awareness of the importance of [[Japanese family|family life]], the roles and responsibilities of family members, the concept of cooperation within the family, and the role of the family in society. The family continues to be an extremely important part of the social infrastructure, and the ministry clearly is interested in maintaining family stability within a changing society. Another change of note was the division of the old [[social studies]] course into ''[[history]]-and-[[geography]]'' and ''[[civics]]'' courses.

The '''Singapore Omni-Theatre''' is an observatory and large-format film theatre located in the [[Science Centre, Singapore]] in the city-state [[Singapore]], South-east Asia.  It opened in 1977.  The Science Centre houses more than 850 exhibits, mostly interactive; the largest collection devoted to science in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iexplore.com/cityguides/Singapore/Singapore+City/Where+to+Go Where to Go in Singapore City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106093749/http://www.iexplore.com/cityguides/Singapore/Singapore+City/Where+to+Go |date=2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
As part of the larger Science Centre, it specifically encompasses an [[observatory]], an omniplanetarium, and an domed projection system to show movies relating to [[science]], [[astronomy]], etc.  A simulation theatre, exhibition room, class room, restaurant, and gift shop are also located on the premises.

==The Observatory==
As one of the few observatories in the world located next to the [[Equator]], [[constellations]] in both the northern and southern celestial hemispheres can be observed and thus opens up more vistas in the sky for observers.

The main [[telescope]] of the Observatory is a 40-cm Cassegrain reflector of combined focal length 520-cm. The sub-telescope is a 15-cm apochromatic Kepler refractor of focal length 180-cm. The equatorial mount for the telescopes was designed for its location; the accompanying English yoke] provides the necessary stability for the drive and tracking mechanisms. The 5.5-metre stainless steel [[dome]] can be made to swivel in any direction and its shutter can be made to slide open for the telescope to be focused onto interesting objects in the sky.

The observatory is situated at geographical coordinates:
1o 20' 03" N latitude
103o 44' 14" E longitude
15.27 m Height (m.s.l)

==The theatre==
The theatre consists of a massive hemispheric screen, twenty-three metres in diameter. This screen is sixteen metres or about five storeys high, and is made up of 376 pieces of vinyl-coated [[aluminium]] panels, covering a surface of 625 m². The material achieves 30% reflectivity, ensuring immense clarity.

About 43 million perforations in the screen allow both sound and air-conditioning to pass through to the audience. Stretching 180 degrees horizontal from wall to wall and tilted at a 30-degree angle to the horizon, the screen "wraps" over the audience to cover 80% of a hemisphere so that the images far exceed a person's field of vision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/otmovie.jsp?type=8&amp;root=0&amp;parent=0&amp;cat=383 Singapore Science Centre: Omni-Theatre|IMAX Screen &amp; Technology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116074956/http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/otmovie.jsp?type=8&amp;root=0&amp;parent=0&amp;cat=383 |date=2007-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre seats 276 and was the first in Southeast Asia.

'''Slow science''' is part of the broader [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]]. It is based on the belief that [[science]] should be a slow, steady, methodical process, and that scientists should not be expected to provide "quick fixes" to society's problems. Slow science supports [[curiosity]]-driven [[Scholarly method|scientific research]] and opposes [[Performance measurement|performance targets]].

'''Southern Illinois University Carbondale''' ('''SIUC''') is a public research university in [[Carbondale, Illinois]], United States. Founded in 1869, SIUC has historically been the largest of the campuses of the [[Southern Illinois University]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icpn.museum.state.il.us/institution/morris-library-southern-illinois-university-carbondale|title=Morris Library at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university enrolls students from all 50 states as well as more than 100 countries. SIU Carbondale offers 3 associate's, 100 bachelor's, 73 master's, and 36 Ph.D programs in addition to professional degrees in architecture, law and medicine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irs.siu.edu/_common/documents/factbook17.pdf|title=Factbook 2016-2017|last=|first=|date=|website=irs.siu.edu|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.siu.edu/programs/index.php|title=Undergraduate Programs {{!}} 2017-2018 Academic Catalog {{!}} SIU|website=2017-2018 Academic Catalog|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gradschool.siu.edu/academics/|title=Degree Programs {{!}} Graduate School {{!}} SIU|website=Graduate School|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Pulliamclocktower.jpg|thumb|The Pulliam Hall clock tower has a carillon that is regularly played. This landmark tower has been incorporated into the logo of Southern Illinois University Carbondale.]]
[[File:Pulliam Hall (SIU).JPG|thumb|SIU Pulliam Hall during sunset]]

An Act of the Twenty-sixth General Assembly of Illinois, approved March 9, 1869, created '''Southern Illinois Normal College,''' the second state-supported [[normal school]] in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Howard, ''Illinois: A History of the Prairie State'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1972), 341.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbondale held the ceremony of cornerstone laying, May 17, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, Eli G. (1955). ''Seventy-Five Years in Retrospect'', Carbondale, IL.: Southern Illinois University. pp. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt; The first historic session of Southern Illinois Normal University was a summer institute, with a first faculty of eight members and an enrollment of 53 students.&lt;ref&gt;"Southern Illinois University: the First Seventy-Five Years." ( Jan 1949). [http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=ua_docs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university continued primarily as a teacher's college until [[Delyte W. Morris]] took office as president of the university in 1948. Morris was SIU's longest-serving president (1948–1970).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19991010060656/http://www.dailyegyptian.com/fall98/delytemorris/]&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Morris transformed SIU, adding Colleges of Law, Medicine and Dentistry. Since World War II, higher education has been emphasized as a goal for more students. Southern Illinois University grew rapidly in size from 3,500 to over 24,800 students between 1950 and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History3.htm/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328072315/http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History3.htm/|date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, a second campus of SIU was established at Edwardsville.  This school, now known as [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]], is an independent university within the SIU system.

== Leadership ==
[[Randy Dunn]] was the eighth president of the Southern Illinois University System. Dr. Dunn served as president at two other state institutions and was the state superintendent of education, appointed to that role by the Illinois State Board of Education. His career in education includes classroom teaching, serving as principal at two school districts, serving as superintendent for two Illinois school systems, and holding the rank of professor at two universities including SIUC.

{{main|Southern Illinois Salukis}}
The '''Southern Illinois Salukis''' are the athletic teams representing Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The university first sponsored athletic teams during the 1913–14 school year, when they were known as the "Maroons." Students and faculty began lobbying for a new mascot during the late 1940s. On March 19, 1951, the student body voted to change the official nickname to the Salukis. The [[saluki]], the royal dog of ancient Egypt, was chosen as the mascot due to its reputation as a fast and tenacious hunter and because the southern Illinois region is known as "[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siusalukis.cstv.com/ot/saluki-mascot.html |title=Southern Illinois Official Athletic Site – Athletics |publisher=Siusalukis.cstv.com |date=March 19, 1951 |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708212123/http://siusalukis.cstv.com/ot/saluki-mascot.html |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salukis sponsor 16 varsity teams. Most compete in the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] (MVC), specifically in men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's golf, softball, women's swimming, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's track and field, and volleyball. The football program competes in the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]] (MVFC). Men's swimming is part of the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC).

=== Cardboard Boat Regatta ===
[[File:Siucampus lake.JPG|thumb|Sunset over Southern Illinois University's Campus Lake.]]
The Cardboard Boat Regatta is an event held every spring semester at Campus Lake. Participants include university students and community members both young and old. The goal is to complete three trips around a 200-yard course on the lake using makeshift cardboard boats. There are three different categories for entries: canoes or kayaks, experimental boats and instant boats (boats created on-site the day of the event).

The idea for a Cardboard Regatta first originated in 1974 at Southern Illinois University. Richard Archer, a professor of Art and Design, dreamed up a final examination for students in his freshman design class. [[Buckminster Fuller]], then a Distinguished Professor at SIU, had espoused the principle of "doing the most with the least," and faculty members found it intriguing to apply these principles in their classes. Archer felt it would be a real test of students' creativity and three-dimensional design skills to build human-sized boats made only of cardboard, and more than 40 years later, it is still happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcbr.com/faqs.html|title=The Great Cardboard Boat Regatta FAQs|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160211185621/http://www.gcbr.com/faqs.html|archivedate=2016-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many communities, organizations and other universities around the country have joined in on the fun and now organize their own Cardboard Boat Regattas.

=== The Stigma Paradigm of Giftedness ===

[[Erving Goffman]]'s (1963) [[social stigma]] theory describes stigmatizing conditions as those attributes which do not conform to the expectations of society and result in social disapproval.  Coleman and Cross identified giftedness as a stigmatizing condition, based on research with gifted students and, in part, on a book that was written and edited by 20 teenage, gifted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=The American Association of Gifted Children|year=1978|title=On Being Gifted|publisher=Walker and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists had already known that [[adolescence]] is a time of identity development in which children struggle with the desire to have a unique identity yet still conform to the expectations of society.  The fact that children viewed their own giftedness as a stigmatizing condition was a new perspective.  Being gifted sets students apart from their peers and this differentness interferes with full social acceptance.  Different social expectations that exist in the various social contexts that children must navigate and the value judgements that may be assigned to the child result in the child's use of social [[coping (psychology)|coping]] strategies to manage his or her identity. Unlike other stigmatizing conditions, giftedness is a unique type of differentness because it can lead to praise or ridicule depending on the audience and circumstances.  Gifted children learn when it is safe for them to display their giftedness and when they should hide their giftedness to better fit in with a group.

=== The Information Management Model (IMM) ===

The Information Management Model (IMM) is a model of the process by which children decide to employ coping strategies to manage their identities.&lt;ref name="Coleman, L. J. &amp; Cross, T. L. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNfGQMT9TkAC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=information+management+model+gifted&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JzKTgwCldl&amp;sig=R_N6zQ9-Eb6sZiYME42X6dpcRuM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9tK4T-KQA8iygwfJ0uXiCg&amp;ved=0CG8Q6AEwAQ|title=Information Management Model in Google Books Version of Being Gifted in School}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is based on [[Bandura]]'s (1986) social-cognitive framework&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bandura|first=Albert|year=1986|title=Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory|publisher=Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Goffman's work on the management of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=Stigma: Notes on the management of spoiled identity|year=1986|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-0-671-62244-2|edition=1st Touchstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; In situations where the child feels different, she or he may decide to manage the information that others know about him or her.  Strategies include: disidentification with giftedness, trying to maintain a very low visibility (invisibility), or creating a high-visibility identity (playing a stereotypical role associated with giftedness). This range of strategies is called the ''Continuum of Visibility''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cross|first=Tracy L.|title=On the social and emotional lives of gifted children :Issues and factors in their psychological development|year=2004|publisher=Prufrock Press|location=Waco, TX|isbn=978-1593630027|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tuition freeze''' is a government policy restricting the ability of administrators of post-secondary educational facilities (i.e. [[college]]s and [[university|universities]]) to increase [[tuition|tuition fees]] for students. Although governments have various reasons for implementing such a policy, the main reason cited is improving accessibility for [[working-class|working-]] and [[middle-class]] students. A tuition fee freeze is a common political goal of the Canadian student movement, especially the [[Canadian Federation of Students]].

A tuition freeze is best known as a [[Canada|Canadian]] political construct, and can accurately be applied only to other countries that offer post-secondary education at a cost. However, the practice of regulating the rates paid by consumers, a formal regulatory process known as [[utility ratemaking]], is carried out in many countries, including the [[United States]], where many industries are classified as [[public utilities]]. Although the classification of public utilities has changed over time, typically such businesses must constitute a ''de facto'' [[monopoly]] (or "[[natural monopoly]]") for the services they provide within a particular jurisdiction. Since a monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity, it can be argued that colleges are an enterprise, or group of businesses that have sole access to a market of higher education, as they are the only supplier of a college degree, and are thus comparable to the monopoly of a group electric companies, who are the sole supplier of electricity.

In Canada, where government regulation of college tuition is practiced, it is applied (currently) at the provincial level, as education (including post-secondary education) is a provincial responsibility under the [[Canadian federalism|division of powers]] between provincial and federal governments. Currently, the provinces of [[Manitoba]], [[Quebec]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] have tuition fee freezes in place. The provinces of [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]] have previously had tuition fee freezes.

In the US, the New Jersey government approved bill A2807 that prohibits most public and private colleges from raising tuition for 9 Semester after they enroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A2807|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A3000/2807_I1.HTM|publisher=STATE OF NEW JERSEY|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wendel Dietterlin.png|150px|right]]
'''Wendel Dietterlin''' (c.1550&amp;ndash;1599), sometimes '''Wendel Dietterlin the Elder''', to distinguish him from his son, was a German [[Northern Mannerism|mannerist]] painter, [[printmaker]] and [[architectural theory|architectural theoretician]]. Most of his paintings are now lost, and he is best known&lt;ref&gt;Heck.&lt;/ref&gt; for his treatise on architectural ornament, ''Architectura'', published in its final edition in Nuremberg in 1598.

==Life==
Dietterlin was born at [[Pfullendorf]] in [[Württemberg]]; his original name was Grapp and he may have been a member of a family of artists in [[Swabia]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 703. According to Martin, he was the son of a Pfullendorf painter named Balthus Grapp or Krapf. Michèle-Caroline Heck, in her biography of Dietterlin in ''Grove'', claims that he "was the son of a Protestant pastor and spent his childhood in Lissenheim before moving to Strasbourg with his widowed mother."&lt;/ref&gt; spent most of his life in [[Strasbourg]] (then Strassburg), where he married Catharina Sprewer on 12 November 1570, and where he is known to have painted frescos for the ''Bruderhof'', the Bishop's residence, in 1575, but he is later recorded in [[Hagenau]] in 1583 and in [[Oberkirch (Baden)|Oberkirch]] in 1589. He also worked on large projects in Stuttgart for some time (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 703; Heck.&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in [[Strasbourg]].

==Paintings==
In Strasbourg, Dietterlin worked on the decoration of the ''Neuer Bau'' (currently the building of the [[Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie, Strasbourg|Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie]]) in 1589. Between 1590 and 1592 he was employed in [[Stuttgart]] with the execution of a large (57 metres long and 20 metres wide) ceiling painting in the upper hall of the ''[[Neues Lusthaus]]'', a building constructed by [[Duke of Württemberg|Duke Ludwig of Württemberg]] for entertainment purposes. In addition to the ceiling, Dietterlin painted the walls of the hall. The Renaissance ''Lusthaus'' having later been rebuilt several times and almost entirely replaced in 1845 by the new ''Hoftheater'' (which was destroyed in a fire in 1902, when some of the remains of the original building came to light),&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; nothing is now preserved of the paintings from the hall, but they are depicted in a 1619 etching by the Strasbourg-based painter and engraver [[Friedrich Brentel]] showing the interior of the large room.&lt;ref&gt;Heck; Borries.&lt;/ref&gt; Other of his paintings are known from engravings by Matthäus Greuter and by his own grandson Bartholomäus Dietterlin. The style, with "exaggerated foreshortenings", appears influenced by North Italian models, such as [[Giulio Romano]]'s frescos in Mantua, through German intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 703; Heck.&lt;/ref&gt;

His only extant painting is a ''Resurrection of Lazarus'' (in the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe]]), signed and dated 1582 or 1587.

==The ''Architectura''==
[[File:Dietterlin, Architectura, Composita, plate 178.jpg|thumb|Columns of the Composite order in Wendel Dietterlin's version. From ''Architectura'', plate 178.]]
Dietterlin's architectural treatise ''Architectvra: Von Außtheilung, Symmetria vnd Proportion der Fünff Seulen'' was first published in separate parts in 1593 and 1594, and finally in a combined and expanded edition in 1598. The book described the [[classical order]]s and their character and proper use, as was traditional in such books. Dietterlin, however, showed less interest in the proportions of the order than in their ornamentation. According to the architectural historian Torbjörn Fulton, Dietterlin treats the orders "more as a basis or excuse for the development of a bizarre ornamental fantasy than as didactic examples of classical architectural ornamentation".&lt;ref&gt;"Även om gravyrserien följer den gängse grupperingen toscana – dorica – ionica – corintia – composita utgör dessa klassiska ordningar till synes mera en utgångspunkt eller förevändning för utvecklandet av en bisarr ornamental fantasi än didaktiska skådeexempel på klassisk arkitekturdekoration." Fulton, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other theoreticians, he ascribed masculine and feminine qualities to the orders. In giving them an appropriate ornamentation that would agree with these qualities, he borrowed from older forms of ornament, including [[Gothic tracery]]. Dietterlin was dependent on many older models, and like other representatives of the Northern Renaissance (such as [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]]) he filled his surfaces with [[scrollwork]], [[strapwork]], gemshapes and [[grotesque]]s. Dietterlin had Northern European contemporaries who likewise integrated Gothic elements in their designs, but he was unusual in the degree of blending of elements of different origin. While others kept Gothic elements clearly separate from Renaissance forms, Dietterlin would cover Renaissance elements in Gothic tracery or allow one to morph midway into the other.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, p. 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt;
