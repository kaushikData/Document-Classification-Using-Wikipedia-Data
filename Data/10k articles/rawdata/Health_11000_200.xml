In December 2016, 78 people died in a mass [[Methanol toxicity|methanol poisoning]] in [[Irkutsk]], one of the largest cities in [[Siberia]], Russia. Precipitated by drinking counterfeit [[surrogate alcohol]], the death toll led the [[Associated Press]] news agency to call it "unprecedented in its scale".&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

While Russia is one of the [[List of countries by alcohol consumption per capita|highest consumers of alcohol per capita in the world]], the use of non-traditional surrogate alcohols rapidly rose in the 2010s due to ongoing economic difficulties in Russia. With a price far below that of government-regulated [[vodka]], surrogates reached an estimated height of twenty percent of the country's alcohol consumption by 2016. These products were often nearly pure alcohol that could be diluted to a rough approximation of vodka, and were frequently available at all hours via strategically placed vending machines. In the Irkutsk incident, the victims drank scented bath lotion that was mislabeled as containing drinkable [[ethanol]].

In the aftermath of the poisoning, regulations on products being used as surrogate alcohols were tightened around the country. Politicians announced a temporary ban on non-food items with more than 25 percent alcohol, which was extended several times.
== Causes and event ==

In the 2010s, Russia's economy [[Economic crisis|suffered]] from a [[Russian financial crisis (2014–present)|financial crisis]], depressed [[oil price]]s, and [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|international sanctions put into place during the Ukrainian crisis]].&lt;ref name="NYT follow-up"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/world/europe/russia-tainted-booze-putin.html|title=Where the Booze Can Kill, and Putin Is Deemed a 'Good Czar'|newspaper=The New York Times|last=MacFarquhar|first=Neil|date=2017-02-18|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/c0c419587e7d44ec8a6c6ac2685b8f2a/Alcohol-poisoning-death-toll-in-Russian-city-rises-to-48|title=Alcohol poisoning death toll in Russian city rises to 49|last=Isachenkov|first=Vladimir|date=2016-12-19|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegie.ru/2017/02/02/decline-not-collapse-bleak-prospects-for-russia-s-economy-pub-67865|title=Decline, Not Collapse: The Bleak Prospects for Russia’s Economy|last=Movchan|first=Andrey|date=2017-02-02|publisher=[[Carnegie Moscow Center]]|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;!--linked to from NYT follow-up article--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With less disposable income to spend, citizens were forced to take drastic measures. In 2017, for instance, approximately half of the country's population was growing fruits and vegetables to supplement their diet, caused in part by a doubling in food prices in the preceding two years.&lt;ref name="NYT follow-up"/&gt;

For alcohol, these citizens—already one of the [[List of countries by alcohol consumption per capita|highest consumers per capita in the world]]—turned to [[surrogate alcohol|surrogates]], a cheaper but unregulated segment of the alcohol market.&lt;ref name="NYT follow-up"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health, 2014|publisher=World Heath Organization|year=2014|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/en/|pages=289–298|chapter=Appendix I|chapter-url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msb_gsr_2014_3.pdf|accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's deputy prime minister remarked that such non-traditional alcohol made up twenty percent of the total consumed in the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia bath lotion kills 48 drinkers in Irkutsk|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38363441|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2016-12-19|accessdate=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure backed up by independent reporting from the ''[[Moscow Times]]'', which noted that the total was still growing.&lt;ref name="Moscow Times pharmacy-alcohol"/&gt; Such a large consumption of unregulated alcohol led to a "regular occurrence" of alcohol poisonings, but the death toll in this single incident was far higher than the norm.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

The [[common hawthorn|hawthorn]]-scented bath lotion, or ''boyaryshnik'', that caused the mass methanol poisoning was purchased as a drink because of its low price amid poor economic conditions—such liquids were not subject to the alcohol [[excise tax]], which had been increased as part of an anti-alcohol effort in 2009, or other restrictions placed in recent years to help curb alcohol consumption in the country.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/world/after-72-die-putin-tightens-limits-on-consumer-products-high-in-alcohol.html|title=After 72 Die, Putin Tightens Limits on Consumer Products High in Alcohol|first=Ivan|last=Nechepurenko|authorlink=Ivan Nechepurenko|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2016-12-22|accessdate=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russian-alcohol-consumption-dives-33-since-2009-56904|title=Russian Alcohol Consumption Dives 33% From 2009|newspaper=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=2017-01-24|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bottles are typically half the size of traditional vodka, their alcohol content is such that they can be diluted into a strength similar to vodka. Moreover, they were often available from vending machines at any time of the night, while government-regulated liquor could only be sold within legally defined hours.&lt;ref name="NYT follow-up"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The machines were often deliberately placed near poorer areas of Russian cities, where the product would be appealing to those seeking a cheaper alternative to regular alcohol.&lt;ref name="Moscow Times pharmacy-alcohol"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/report-russias-illegal-pharmacy-alcohol-industry-growing-56313|title=Reports Show Russia's Illegal ‘Pharmacy-Alcohol’ Industry Is Booming|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=2016-11-25|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Everybody knew that it was not bath oil," one individual told ''The New York Times'' after the poisoning. "That label was just meant to fend off the inspectors."&lt;ref name="NYT follow-up"/&gt;

The fatal batch of lotion involved in this mass poisoning was made with [[methanol]] (methyl alcohol, wood alcohol, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH), which is [[Methanol poisoning|poisonous]] to the central nervous system and other parts of the body. Methanol is cheaper than ethanol (ethyl alcohol, grain alcohol, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH), the alcohol found in vodka and other alcoholic drinks. The two alcohols are similar in many respects and cannot readily be distinguished.

According to early reports, a total of 57 people were hospitalized, with 49 dying.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The victims were described as being poor residents of the Novo-Lenino neighborhood in Irkutsk, all between the ages of 35 and 50.&lt;ref name="CBS News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTpoison"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dozens Dead in Siberia from Counterfeit Alcohol Poisoning|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/26-dead-in-irkutsk-from-alcohol-poisoning-56573|accessdate=2016-12-21|work=Moscow Times|date=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent reports increased the number affected: first to 55 deaths (with a total of 94 affected),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/death-toll-from-alcohol-poisoning-in-irkutsk-rises-56590|title=Death Toll From Siberian Alcohol Poisoning Rises to 55|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=2016-12-20|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; then 62 (with 107 affected),&lt;ref name="Guardian clampdown"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/21/vladimir-putin-clampdown-surrogate-alcohol-deaths-fake-bath-tincture-irkutsk |title=Vladimir Putin orders clampdown on 'surrogate' alcohol as deaths rise |author= Shaun Walker |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2016-12-21 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38395013 |title=Russia bath lotion poisoning: Putin orders crackdown as death toll rises |publisher=BBC News |date=2016-12-21 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 77 (number of affected not given),&lt;ref name="Reuters follow-up"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-alcohol-poisoning-idUKKBN14G119|title=Russia opens criminal case into official after 77 die of alcohol poisoning|publisher=Reuters|first=Peter|last=Hobson|date=2016-12-27|accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally down to 74.

==Aftermath==
Twenty-three people involved in the production of the lotion were arrested by Russian authorities, many of which were local vendors who sold the product, with one senior regional government official for the greater Siberian region being charged with negligence.&lt;ref name="Reuters follow-up"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/suspected-surrogate-alcohol-supplier-arrested-in-irkutsk-56627|title=Suspected Surrogate Alcohol Supplier Arrested in Irkutsk|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=2016-12-23|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; About {{convert|500|l|gal}} of remaining counterfeit lotion were seized from the underground facility where it had been produced,&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; and a few days later {{convert|13500|l|gal}} of methanol-containing liquid was seized from a warehouse in Irkutsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/13500-liters-of-washer-fluid-containing-methanol-found-in-siberian-city-of-irkutsk-56654|title=Russia Uncovers Illegal Cache of Methanol in Irkutsk|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=2016-12-27|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further five people were arrested in January 2017, charged with selling and publicizing surrogate alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/counterfeit-alcohol-makers-arrested-in-siberia-56986|title=Counterfeit Alcohol Producers Arrested in Siberia|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=2017-01-31|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the incident, a spokesperson for [[Russian president]] [[Vladimir Putin]] called it a "terrible tragedy",&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; blaming it on a failing of "supervisory bodies":&lt;ref name="NYT follow-up"/&gt; "What happened in Irkutsk was a tremendous tragedy.

On 22 December, Putin announced that regulations on products with more than 25 percent alcohol would be tightened, and punishments would be increased for those who break manufacturing and distribution laws related to them.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian clampdown"/&gt; In addition, deputy prime minister [[Alexander Khloponin]] publicly supported tightening access to "medications" like ''boyaryshnik'' through requiring pharmaceutical [[Medical prescription|prescription]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/alcohol-based-medicines-to-need-prescriptions-after-siberian-poisoning-tragedy-56619|title=Alcohol-Based Medicines to Need Prescriptions After Siberian Poisoning Tragedy|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=2016-12-22|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following day, Medvedev ordered Russia's government agency devoted to consumer protection, [[Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare|Rospotrebnadzor]], to ban all sales of non-food items with more than 25 percent alcohol. Their 30-day order came into effect on 26 December and was scheduled to run for one month before being extended for a further 60 days in January, March, and July; the restrictions did not cover perfumes and glass-cleaning products.&lt;ref name="International Journal of Drug Policy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/sales-of-non-food-products-containing-alcohol-suspended-56643|title=Russia Suspends Sale of Non-Food Products Containing Alcohol|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=2016-12-26|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russia-extends-alcohol-product-restrictions-by-2-months-56917|title=Russia Extends Restrictions on Sale of Alcohol Products After Mass Poisoning|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=2017-01-25|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further restrictions were considered, with one top health official announcing that a [[state monopoly]] may be imposed on Russia's perfume and pharmaceutical industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russian-government-mulls-alcohol-monopoly-on-perfume-and-pharmaceuticals-57133|title=Russian Government Mulls Alcohol Monopoly on Perfume and Pharmaceuticals|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=2017-02-13|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Russia amended its legal code to strengthen punishments for illegally producing and selling alcohol, banning the kind of alcoholic vending machines through which the Irkutsk bath lotion was sold, and prohibiting online advertisements of alcoholic retailers. The latter's legalization had been mooted prior to the poisoning.&lt;ref name="International Journal of Drug Policy"/&gt;

Individuals interviewed by a ''New York Times'' reporter in February 2017 were skeptical that any measures would be successful in significantly impacting illegal alcohol sales, given that it was such a high percentage of the total market for alcohol.&lt;ref name="NYT follow-up"/&gt; Still, Rospotrebnadzor announced at the end of January that the country had seen its first decline in monthly alcohol poisoning deaths in five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russia-sees-sharp-decline-in-alcohol-poisoning-in-january-56977|title=Russia Sees Sharp Decline in Alcohol Poisoning in January|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=2017-01-30|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Adverse]] Childhood [[Experiences]] (ACEs) Movement''' is a set of [[grassroots]] initiatives developing [[interventions]] and "tests of change" to reduce the incidence and societal effects of [[Adverse Childhood Experiences Study|Adverse Childhood Experiences]] and to promote healing from these experiences.

The ACEs Movement arose out of the need for a [[bidirectional effort]] to create a public health change, with both [[individuals]] and institutions/ government systems. The individual is essential, because change is on the individual level is [[self-directed]]. The [[Non-governmental organization|institutions]] and government systems engagement is essential, because without the structure surrounding individuals changing, the very systems that are intended to help, can perpetuate the cycle of trauma.

Dr. Sandra Bloom's book "[[Destroying Sanctuary]]" states in its introduction that 17th century philosophers like [[René Descartes|Descartes]] took apart the person and "turned over the body to physicians and the mind to philosophers and clergy," and in the ACEs movement society is now trying to bring them back together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofzdFRgzxpUC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;q=descartes|title=Destroying Sanctuary: The Crisis in Human Service Delivery Systems|last=Bloom|first=Sandra L.|last2=Farragher|first2=Brian|date=2010-10-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199830848|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Amateur Sports Act of 1978''', signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]], established the [[United States Olympic Committee]] and provides for national governing bodies for each [[Olympic sports|Olympic sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=30133 |title= Jimmy Carter: "Amateur Sports Act of 1978 Statement on Signing S. 2727 Into Law. ," November 8, 1978 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act provides important legal protection for individual athletes.&lt;ref&gt;36 [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] § 220501&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Prior to the adoption of the Act in 1978, the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) represented the United States on international competition matters and regulated amateur sports generally. The AAU had adopted arbitrary rules which prohibited women from participating in running events and prohibited any runner who had raced in the same event as a runner with a shoe-company sponsorship. Congress adopted the Act in response to criticisms of the AAU, effectively removing that organization from any governance role.

The AAU now continues as a voluntary organization largely promoting youth sports. While it still has a major role in promoting track, it is now best known for sponsoring youth basketball competitions.

==Overview==
The Act charters the U.S. Olympic Committee, which in turn can charter a national governing body (NGB) for each sport, such as [[USA Swimming]], the [[United States Fencing Association]], the [[United States Ski Team]], [[USA Track &amp; Field]], [[USA Shooting]], or the [[U.S. Figure Skating]]. Each NGB in turn establishes the rules for selecting the United States Olympic Team and promotes amateur competition in that sport.

The Act requires that active athletes (defined as amateur athletes who have represented the United States in international amateur competition within the last ten years) must hold 20 percent of the voting power of any board or committee in an NGB. The Act also provides athletes with due process and appeal rights concerning eligibility disputes. 

The Act gives exclusive rights of usage of the words ''Olympic'' and ''[[Olympiad]]'' to the Olympic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/36/220506-|title=36 U.S. Code § 220506 - Exclusive right to name, seals, emblems, and badges|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee used this act to sue other organizations which used this term "Olympics", such as the [[Gay Olympics]].&lt;ref name="mpbn.net"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mpbn.net/Home/tabid/36/ctl/ViewItem/mid/3478/ItemId/17541/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927082357/http://www.mpbn.net/Home/tabid/36/ctl/ViewItem/mid/3478/ItemId/17541/Default.aspx |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1998 Revision ==
The '''Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act''' is a [[United States]] law (codified at 36 U.S.C. Sec. 220501 et seq. of the [[United States Code]]) that charters and grants monopoly status to the [[United States Olympic Committee]], and specifies requirements for its member national [[sport governing body|governing bodies]] for individual [[sport]]s.  

The current version of the Act was sponsored by [[Ted Stevens]], then–[[United States Senator|Senator]] from [[Alaska]], and adopted in 1998.  It is a revision of the previous Amateur Sports Act of 1978 that reflects changes such as the fact that [[amateurism]] is no longer a requirement for competing in most international sports, expansion of the USOC's role to include the [[Paralympic Games]], increased athlete representation, and protection of the USOC against lawsuits involving athletes' right to participate in the [[Olympic Games]].

The United States Olympic Committee has used the law to force the "Gay Olympics" to change their name to the [[Gay Games]].&lt;ref name="mpbn.net"/&gt; The organization has threatened to use the law against the "Redneck Olympics," though it has given special dispensation to the [[Special Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/oxford-hills/story/1071387|title=Redneck Olympics faces lawsuit over name - Lewiston Sun Journal|date=9 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/oxford-hills/story/1071616|title=Redneck Olympics faces lawsuit over name - Lewiston Sun Journal|date=9 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audrey Elizabeth Callaghan, Baroness Callaghan of Cardiff''' (''{{nee}}'' '''Moulton'''; 28 July 1915 &amp;ndash; 15 March 2005) was the wife of [[James Callaghan]], who served in each of the [[Great Offices of State]] including that of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. She once served as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] councillor and later became a campaigner and fundraiser for children's health and welfare.

==Early life==
She was born in [[Maidstone, Kent]], where her father was a director of the Lead Wool Company, a tool company.  She would chair the Maidstone [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Fabian Society]]. She joined the Labour Party while in her teens and met her future husband in the early 1930s at the [[Baptist]] church [[Sunday school]] where they both worked,&lt;ref name="Guardian obit" /&gt; then at the Labour Party, but they did not marry until 28 July 1938. They honeymooned in [[Paris]] and [[Chamonix]] and then returned to rent a house in [[West Norwood|Norwood]].

Callaghan was educated at [[Maidstone Grammar School for Girls]], then studied cookery at [[Battersea]] College of Domestic Science. She worked as a [[dietician]] at an [[antenatal]] clinic in [[Greenwich]] during the Second World War, a young mother herself. At the same time, she studied economics at a [[University of London]] extension course in [[Eltham, London|Eltham]], with future Labour Party leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] as tutor. She made a special study of malnutrition in children and its remedies.

==Career==
Her husband James had been elected a [[Cardiff (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for Cardiff]] in 1945 and she was at his side throughout his career. She was somewhat derided, described as "the Yorkshire Pudding", ostensibly for her skill in cooking, but also as a reference to her perceived poor dress sense and mildly disorganised appearance. She was ridiculed for her hobby of keeping pigs. She remained very private and shunned the limelight. However, she was engaged with her husband's jobs and was said to be instrumental in dissuading him from resignation after the 1967 [[devaluation]] of the pound.&lt;ref name="Guardian obit" /&gt;

In 1959, Audrey was elected as the Labour member for [[Lewisham]] for the [[London County Council]]. She took a special interest in children's homes and the Children's Committee. She was an [[alderman]] of the [[Greater London Council]] from 1964 and became chairman of Lewisham Council's children's committee, where she was also an alderman, when the GLC was abolished.

In 1969 Callaghan became the chair of the board of governors of [[Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children]].  She continued raising funds for the hospital for the next thirty years, most notably securing an extension of copyright on ''[[Peter Pan]]'' for the hospital by a Lords amendment moved by her husband.&lt;ref name="Guardian obit" /&gt;

In 1987, when James was created Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, she became Lady Callaghan. She herself refused a [[dame]]hood from Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. They retired to a farm in [[Ringmer]], [[East Sussex]], where she kept pigs and he kept cows and sheep, and grew barley. Along with her husband she supported causes relating to the [[University College of Swansea]], of which James Callaghan was president.

During her eighties, Callaghan developed [[Alzheimer's disease]]. In July 2001, when her condition had deteriorated, she entered a care home run by [[Catholic nun]]s, where her husband visited her every day until her death in March 2005,&lt;ref name="Guardian obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Langdon|first=Julia|title=Obituary: Audrey Callaghan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/17/guardianobituaries.health|accessdate=10 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which time they had been married for 66 years and together for well over 70. He died just eleven days after her death just a day shy of his 93rd birthday.

==Personal life==
She had three children: [[Margaret Jay, Baroness Jay of Paddington]]; Julia and Michael.

'''Axillary lymphadenopathy''' is [[lymphadenopathy]] of the [[axillary lymph nodes]].

==Causes ==
*[[Cat scratch fever]]
*[[Brucellosis]]
*[[Lymphoma]]
*[[Rheumatoid arthritis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|956340|Lymphadenopathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
To diagnose this condition, scans or other imaging tests are used. Enlarged nodes in the vicinity of cancer areas could potentially contain cancer.
Probable patients are observed for few weeks until the cause of lymphadenopathy becomes obvious and they are instructed to return to the doctor if there is increase in node size. Biopsy should be performed in case tests suggest malignancy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/lymph-nodes-and-cancer{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His treatise on venereal disease was the first to suggest that syphilis and gonorrhea were different diseases, a hypothesis which was not accepted by mainstream medicine until many decades later. Bell's main contribution to surgical practice was his adage 'save skin', which led to improved rates of wound healing in operations like mastectomy and limb amputation. He was also an early advocate of routine pain relief in surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre I.M.C.

==Early life==
Benjamin Bell was born in [[Dumfries]] on 6 September 1749, the eldest surviving child in a family of 15 children. His father George Bell (1722–1813) farmed at Woodhouselees, a mile south of the village of Canonbie in Dumfriesshire. In addition to farming, George Bell was involved in a series of business ventures which met with mixed success. This background of modest wealth was to prove important for Benjamin in later life, allowing him to visit surgeons in London and Paris and enabling him to take time away from his surgical practice to write a major textbook. The family tradition in agriculture was to re-emerge towards the end of his life. They owned Blackett House in Middlebie Parish (Dumfriesshire), which was later sold to fund the education of the family. Benjamin's early education was at Dumfries Grammar school.

==Surgical training==

He became an apprentice to [[James Hill (surgeon)'|James Hill (1703-1776)]], a surgeon in Dumfries, before moving to [[Edinburgh]] in 1766 to study medicine at Edinburgh University under the tutelage of some of the most inspiring medical teachers of the day, including [[Alexander Monro (secundus)|Alexander Monro]] (Secundus; 1733–1817) the anatomist, [[Joseph Black]] (1728–99) the chemist and [[John Hope (botanist)|John Hope]] (1725–86) the botanist. In November 1767 he was appointed dresser in the surgical wards of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and surgeons' clerk 2 years later. He visited London and Paris, writing to his father that had he been planning a career as a physician he would have been happy to stay in Edinburgh, "but for a surgeon I assure you Edinburgh comes greatly short of either Paris or London and for that reason Dr. Monro and any others that I have spoken to here upon the subject approve of the scheme [the Paris visit] very much".&lt;ref name="Bell B 1868"&gt;Bell B. The life, character &amp; writings of Benjamin Bell, F.R.C.S.E., F.R.S.E. Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas; 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1770 after passing the necessary examinations, he was elected a freeman surgeon-apothecary of the Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh later the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Royal College of Surgeons]] of Edinburgh. 
In 1772 Bell was in London from where he wrote to [[William Cullen|Dr. Cullen]] thanking him for his letter of introduction to [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] (1728–1793) whom he described as "the most agreeable and at the same time the most useful acquaintance I ever met with."&lt;ref name="Bell B 1868"/&gt; He also visited and observed the London surgeon [[Percivall Pott]] (1714–1788) to whom he would later dedicate his treatise on ulcers. Bell's interest in science is evident from his description of a lecture which he attended at the Royal Society given by [[Joseph Priestley]]. Priestley's suggestion that atmospheric air contained fixed air (carbon dioxide) and dephlogisticated air (oxygen) clearly made an impression on Bell who noted from the lecture that "air can be spoiled by one or more animals breathing it in a confined space and become unfit for purposes of life"&lt;ref name="Bell B 1868"/&gt;

==Practice==
On return to Edinburgh he set up in surgical practice and within a year, at the age of 24, was elected one of four attendant surgeons to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Surgeons attended in rotation and Bell managed to remain a surgeon to the Infirmary for eighteen years, an unusually long period. This may have been because of his lifelong friendship with [[James Gregory (physician)|James Gregory]], the Professor of Physic, and the most influential member of the Infirmary Board of Management. In 1800 there was pressure from younger members of the College of Surgeons to change the system of appointment of surgeons to the Infirmary, making shorter appointments so that more junior surgeons might gain Infirmary experience. At that time, now well established in practice, Bell was content to step down, but he wrote to the College setting out the case for 'permanent appointments' to the Infirmary rotation, a view which had been also promoted by Gregory. Of the 23 members of the College of Surgeons asked to vote on the matter, not one supported Bell's proposal. [[John Bell (surgeon)|John Bell]] (1763–1820), a successful teacher of anatomy in his own extramural school and an accomplished Edinburgh surgeon (but not related to Benjamin Bell), failed to gain appointment to the Infirmary rota, and began to campaign against what he saw as the injustice of the rota system. As part of this he wrote criticising Gregory's views 9, and this brought the Bells, Benjamin and John into conflict. This feud was at the heart of much of the criticism to which Benjamin Bell was subjected by his namesake.

In 1775 Bell fell from horseback and sustained injuries that were to force him to take an rest from surgical practice for some two years. This rest was to prove fortuitous, for it allowed him time to reflect and to write, and his relatively wealthy background enabled him to do this without financial concerns. To further develop his interest in farming during this period of recuperation, he took the lease of Liberton Farm situated some two miles south of the centre of Edinburgh.

Returning to what was to prove a highly successful career as a surgeon in Edinburgh, Bell went into practice with James Gibson (died 1815) who was to become president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1778–79. Later he formed another surgical partnership with James Russell (1754–1836) and Andrew Wardrop (died 1823). Bell, Wardop and Russell became the leading surgical practice in Scotland with a wide referral base. Wardrop reckoned Bell "… was a successful operator and during many years was more employed than any surgeon in Scotland". He went so far as to boast of his partner that "…no one could die contented without having consulted Benjamin Bell."&lt;ref name="Bell B 1868"/&gt;

On 17 November 1783 Benjamin Bell was one of the founding Fellows of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

He died at Newington House in south [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried with other family members, including his wife Grizzel Hamilton, in the south-east corner of [[Canongate Churchyard]] in [[Edinburgh]].

==Bell's contributions to surgery==
Benjamin Bell is considered by many to have been the first Scottish scientific surgeon. This reputation was based largely on his influential textbook ''A System of Surgery''.&lt;ref&gt;Bell B. A system of surgery. 1st ed. Edinburgh: Bell &amp; Bradfute; 1796.https://archive.org/details/asystemsurgery04bellgoog&lt;/ref&gt; He can be regarded as a 'scientific' surgeon because of his rational thought processes which are apparenent in his treatises, particularly his Treatise on Gonorrhoea virulenta and Lues venerea (1793).&lt;ref&gt;Bell B. A treatise on gonorrhoea virulenta, and lues venerea. Edinburgh: James Watson and Co. [etc.]; 1793.&lt;/ref&gt; Another treatise, [https://archive.org/details/atreatiseontheo00bellgoog The Theory and Management of Ulcers], was first published in 1778 and is still considered one of the classics of 18th-century physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Bell B. A treatise on the theory and management of ulcers: with a dissertation on white swellings of the joints. A new edition. ed. Edinburgh: printed for Charles Elliot; and for C. Elliot and T. Kay...London; 1789; An edition was published in [[Boston]] in 1797 [http://www.marshall.edu/library/speccoll/virtual_museum/hoffman/bell_benjamin.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''A System of Surgery''==
[https://archive.org/details/asystemsurgery04bellgoog The ''System''] appeared in six volumes between 1783 and 1788. By 1801 no fewer than seven editions had been published, and it went on to Italian, French, Spanish, German and three American editions. It was popular was because it was comprehensive; made use of up-to-date published material from all over Europe, and because of Bell's reputation as a surgeon. Bell was an advocate of the routine use of [[opium]] to relieve post-operative pain, stating "to be able to alleviate the misery of those who are obliged to submit to dangerous operations must afford the biggest gratification to every practitioner." Bell also credited his fellow [[Scot]], James Moore, with developing a clamp to produce nerve compression in the arm or leg to provide analgesia for [[amputation]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080620022300/http://www.rcsed.ac.uk/journal/svol3_2/3020008.html]

==Farming==

Bell's family background was in farming, and, during his two-year break from surgery after his accident in 1775, he rented Liberton farm two miles from central Edinburgh, and his interest in the subject was revived. He frequently wrote to his father for agricultural advice.

==Property dealings==

Bell bought the lands of [[Newington, Edinburgh|Newington]] in South Edinburgh in 1803 and was responsible for the development of the area. He built Newington House for himself just before his death. Although this house was demolished in 1966, the streets around where it lay include Blacket Avenue and Middleby Street named after the Dumfriesshire localities of Bell's youth. His son, George, commissioned architect [[James Gillespie Graham]] (1776–1855) to prepare plans for housing and the subdivision of the land into plots.

==Family==
Prior to marriage he lived as Gosford Close on the [[Royal Mile]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1773&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell married Grizel Hamilton, daughter of the [[Very Rev Prof Robert Hamilton]] [[FRSE]] (1707–1787), in 1774. After marriage he moved to a handsome house on Old Assembly Close.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office directory 1775&lt;/ref&gt; They had several sons who rose to prominence in Edinburgh society: George Bell [[FRSE]] (1777–1832), Robert Bell [[FRSE]] (1782–1861), William Bell [[FRSE]] (1783–1849)

==Dynasty==
Bell was the progenitor of one of the great Edinburgh surgical dynasties. His son Joseph, grandson Benjamin and great-grandson Joseph (1837–1911) were all surgeons in Edinburgh, and all became presidents of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. His great-grandson [[Joseph Bell]] (1837–1911), was known for his diagnostic abilities, which depended on his ability to observe minute details. This inspired a young Edinburgh medical student [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] (1859–1930) to base the fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] on Joseph Bell.

'''''Birth Story: Ina May Gaskin and the Farm Midwives''''' is a 2012 documentary film about [[Ina May Gaskin]] directed by [[Sara Lamm]] and [[Mary Wigmore]].

==Plot==
The documentary shows Gaskin and others practicing [[home birth]] at a commune. Today as nearly one third of all US babies are born via [[C-section]]; the struggle is to protect their [[midwifery]] knowledge and to promote respectful, safe maternity practices. 

From the backs of school buses, these birth activists rescue American midwifery from extinction and change the way a generation approaches pregnancy. With unprecedented access to the midwives' archival video collection, as well as modern footage of life at the alternative community where they live, this documentary shows childbirth the way most people have never seen it.

'''Cerebral vasculitis''' or '''central nervous system vasculitis''' (sometimes the word '''angiitis''' is used instead of "vasculitis") is [[vasculitis]] (inflammation of the [[blood vessel]] wall) involving the [[brain]] and occasionally the [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref name="PrimeHealth"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.primehealthchannel.com/cerebral-vasculitis.html|title=Cerebral Vasculitis|date=19 December 2012|newspaper=Prime Health Channel|access-date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affects all of the vessels: very small blood vessels ([[capillaries]]), medium-size blood vessels ([[arteriole]]s and [[venule]]s), or large blood vessels ([[arteries]] and [[veins]]). If blood flow in a vessel with vasculitis is reduced or stopped, the parts of the body that receive blood from that vessel begins to die. It may produce a wide range of [[neurology|neurological]] symptoms, such as [[headache]], skin rashes, [[Fatigue (medical)|feeling very tired]], [[arthralgia|joint pains]], difficulty moving or coordinating part of the body, changes in sensation, and alterations in perception, thought or behavior, as well as the phenomena of a [[tumor|mass lesion]] in the brain leading to [[coma]] and [[brain herniation|herniation]]. Some of its signs and symptoms may resemble [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scolding NJ, Jayne DR, Zajicek JP, Meyer PA, Wraight EP, Lockwood CM |title=Cerebral vasculitis--recognition, diagnosis and management |journal=QJM |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=61–73 |date=January 1997 |pmid=9093590 |doi= 10.1093/qjmed/90.1.61}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10% have associated [[cerebral hemorrhage|bleeding in the brain]].&lt;ref name="Rehman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rehman HU |title=Primary angiitis of the central nervous system |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=93 |issue=11 |pages=586–8 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11198690 |pmc=1298150 |doi= |url=http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/93/11/586 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
'''"Primary" or angiitis/vasculitis of the central nervous system''' (PACNS) is said to be present if there is no underlying cause. The exact mechanism of the primary disease is unknown, but the fundamental mechanism of all vasculitides is [[autoimmunity]]. Other possible secondary causes of cerebral vasculitis are [[infection]]s, systemic auto-immune diseases such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE) and [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[medication]]s and [[Recreational drug use|drugs]] ([[amphetamine]], [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]]), some forms of [[cancer]] ([[lymphoma]]s, [[leukemia]] and [[lung cancer]]) and other forms of systemic vasculitis such as [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], [[polyarteritis nodosa]] or [[Behçet's disease]]. It may imitate, and is in turn imitated by, a number of other diseases that affect the blood vessels of the brain diffusely such as [[fibromuscular dysplasia]] and [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]].&lt;ref name="Rehman" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[Cerebral angiography]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], family medical history, symptoms, a complete physical examination, and ultimately [[biopsy]] of the brain, are often required for the diagnosis. Also, many lab tests must be done for the diagnosis; tests may reveal [[anemia]] (a shortage of red blood cells), a [[leukocytosis|high white blood cell count]], a [[thrombocytosis|high platelet count]], allergic reactions, immune complexes, antibodies (tools the body uses to fight off threats) and elevation of inflammatory markers.&lt;ref name="ClevelandClinic"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases_conditions/hic_central_nervous_system_vasculitis|title=Central Nervous System Vasculitis (CNS Vasculitis)|website=Cleveland Clinic|access-date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another crucial part in the diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis is the use of imaging techniques. Techniques such as conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) are used to find and monitor cerebral involvement.

==Treatment==
Treatment is first with many different high-dose steroids, namely [[glucocorticoid]]s. Then, if symptoms do not improve additional [[immunosuppression]] such as [[cyclophosphamide]] are added to decrease the immune system's attack on the body's own tissues.&lt;ref name="Rehman" /&gt; Cerebral vasculitis is a very rare condition that is difficult to diagnose, and as a result there are significant variations in the way it is diagnosed and treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scolding NJ, Wilson H, Hohlfeld R, Polman C, Leite I, Gilhus N |title=The recognition, diagnosis and management of cerebral vasculitis: a European survey |journal=Eur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1235">'''Cross education''' is a [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] phenomenon where an increase in [[physical strength|strength]] is witnessed within an untrained limb following unilateral strength training in the opposite, contralateral limb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 17190532 | year = 2007 | last1 = Lee | first1 = M. | last2 = Carroll | title = Cross education: possible mechanisms for the contralateral effects of unilateral resistance training | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | issn = 0112-1642 | journal = Sports Medicine | doi = 10.2165/00007256-200737010-00001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross education can also be seen in the transfer of skills from one limb to the other.

==Examples==
A resistance trainer witnesses strength gains in her left and right [[biceps]] after participating in a strength training program for only her right biceps.  This phenomenon is due to factors both at the [[muscular]], [[vertebral column|spinal]] and [[neural]] levels.

A basketball player learns to dribble a basketball with his right hand and then successfully performs the task with his left hand even though he had undergone no previous training with his left side.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8533">'''Dietary Reference Values''' (DRV) is the name of the nutritional requirements systems used by the [[United Kingdom]] [[Department of Health]] and the [[European Union]]'s [[European Food Safety Authority]].

In 1991, the [[United Kingdom]] [[Department of Health]] published the '''''Dietary Reference Values for Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom'''''. This records Dietary Reference Values which recommended nutritional intakes for the UK population. The DRVs can be divided into three types:&lt;ref&gt;Dietary Reference Values of Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom (Report on Health &amp; Social Subjects)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A comparison of dietary reference values for energy of different countries|last1=Hauber |first1=U |last2=Bruce |first2=A |last3=Neuhäuser-Berthold |first3=M |pmid=9467239|volume=36|journal=Z Ernahrungswiss|pages=394-402 |date=1997 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*RNI - Reference Nutrient Intake (95% of the population's requirement is met)
*EAR - Estimated Average Requirement (50% of the population's requirement is met)
*LRNI - Lower Recommended Nutritional Intake (5% of the population's requirement is met)

RNI is not the same as [[Dietary Reference Intake|RDA]] (Recommended Daily Allowance) or [[Guideline Daily Amount|GDA]], although they are often similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/nutritionscience/foodfacts/food-labelling-and-health-claims?start=2 |title=Food labelling and health claims |accessdate=31 January 2011 |publisher=British Nutrition Foundation }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current recommendations==

General advice is given for healthy people using the table. The government recommends that healthy people should eat a diet which contains plenty of starch (rice, bread, pasta and potatoes). It also recommends that a person should eat at least 5 fruit or vegetable portions each day. Meat, fish, eggs and other protein-rich foods should be eaten in moderation. Dairy products should also be moderately consumed. Finally, salt, saturated fat and sugar should be eaten least of all.

This advice is summarized in the '''[[eatwell guide]]'''&lt;ref name=eatwell&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide | title=The Eatwell Guide | accessdate=30 July 2018 | publisher=Public Health England (part of UK government)}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Note that exceptions to these rules include pregnant women and young children. Additionally, those who have little exposure to sunlight may need to take vitamin D supplementation.

===Sources of energy===
The Dietary Reference Values below are specified mainly for adults. They define the proportion of a person's total energy intake which should come from different components of food. These include fat and fatty acids, fibre, starch and sugars. Note that these values do not apply to children, and children younger than five with small appetites should not have such restrictions imposed.&lt;ref name="nutguide"&gt;http://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/nutrientinstitution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Nutrient !! Population average % of food energy&lt;ref name="nutguide" /&gt;
|-
| Saturated Fatty Acid || Not more than 11%
|-
| Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid || 6.5%
|-
| Monounsaturated Fatty Acid || 13%
|-
| Trans fats || Not more than 2%
|-
| Total Fat || Not more than 35%
|-
| Non-milk extrinsic sugars || Not more than 11%
|-
| Intrinsic milk sugars and starch || 39%
|-
| Total Carbohydrate || 50%
|-
| Fibre as non-starch polysaccharide || 18% [not applicable to children under 5]
|-
|}

===Salt===

The guideline salt intake for adults is about 6 grams of salt (approximately one teaspoon). The Food Standards Agency estimate the average salt intake is about 8.6 grams/day &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2008/jul/sodiumrep08|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] Food Standards Agency - UK salt intake levels heading in the right direction|author=Food Standards Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2008). A high salt diet is likely to increase the risk of high blood pressure, which is associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Age !! Target salt intake (grams per day)&lt;ref name="nutguide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eatwell" /&gt;
|-
| 0–6 months || Less than 1g
|-
| 7–12 months || 1g
|-
| 1–3 years || 2g
|-
| 4–6 years || 3g
|-
| 7–10 years || 5g
|-
| 11 years+ || 6g
|-
|}

===Protein, vitamins and minerals===

Recommendations for protein, vitamins and minerals vary by age. Where different intakes for males and females are recommended, the higher value is identified in the table below to ensure that the greatest daily needs of the group is met: 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Nutrient !! 1-3yrs !! 4-6yrs !! 7-10yrs !! 11-14yrs !! 15-18yrs !! Adults 19-50 yrs !! Adults 50+ 
|-
| Protein || 15g || 20g || 28g || 42g || 55g || 55g || 53g 
|-
| Iron || 7mg || 6mg || 9mg || 14.8mg || 14.8mg || 14.8mg || 9mg
|-
| Zinc || 5mg || 6.5mg || 7mg || 9mg || 9.5mg || 9.5mg || 9.5mg
|-
| Vitamin A (retinol equivalents) || 400mcg || 400mcg || 500mcg || 600mcg || 700mcg || 700mcg || 700mcg 
|-
| Folate || 70mcg || 100mcg || 150mcg || 200mcg || 200mcg || 200mcg || 200mcg 
|-
| Vitamin C || 30mg || 30mg || 30mg || 35mg || 40mg || 40mg || 40mg
|-
|}

==Extension to EU level==
{{update|date=July 2013}}
In recent times,{{When|date=June 2012}} '''Dietary Reference Values''' are under the interest of the [[European Food Safety Authority]] too, which intend to extend them at the EU level. EFSA is the equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA, and acts as watchdog inside the European market in order to establish a common ground on food safety requirements and nutrition as well.

EFSA met in September 2009 with representative of the Member States in order to gain their views on fats, carbohydrates, fibres and water as well as Food-Based Dietary Guidelines.
Furthermore EFSA is searching for comments (Open Consultation) by 15 October, in order to validate its assumptions on the need to have:

* carbohydrates comprising 45%–60% of the overall daily caloric intake
* fats being comprised among 20%–35% of the overall caloric intake
* fibre needs: complying with 25 grams/day

EFSA considers that there are not sufficient data to set DRVs for sugars, and not systematic scientific substantiation linking diseases such as stroke or diabetes (DMT1 or DMT2) to an increased intake of sugars (glycemic load/glycemic index).
In any case, there is much literature referring to this link, on journals with very high impact factor and statistically robust design and results

Many problems seem nowadays to derive from having integrated EU level DRV:
* the presence of a previous EFSA opinion on Food Based Dietary Guidelines, aimed at stressing the need of having only country-based guidelines, against the WHO hypothesis. This is due to very different food patterns, for EFSA, inside Europe.
* the presence of private scheme such as GDA (Guidelines on Daily Amounts), referring on the same subject (calories from nutrient groups) but casting shadow on the effectiveness of DRVs as public authorities' scheme.

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
A '''dietary supplement''' is a manufactured product intended to supplement the diet when taken by mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid.&lt;ref name="ods-nih"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Supplements: Background Information|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/DietarySupplements-HealthProfessional/|publisher=Office of Dietary Supplements, US National Institutes of Health|accessdate=2 February 2018|date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A supplement can provide [[nutrient]]s either extracted from food sources or synthetic, individually or in combination, in order to increase the quantity of their consumption. The class of nutrient compounds includes [[vitamin]]s, [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], [[Dietary fiber|fiber]], [[fatty acid]]s and [[amino acid]]s. Dietary supplements can also contain substances that have not been confirmed as being essential to life, but are marketed as having a beneficial biological effect, such as plant [[pigment]]s or [[polyphenol]]s. Animals can also be a source of supplement ingredients, as for example [[collagen]] from chickens or fish. These are also sold individually and in combination, and may be combined with nutrient ingredients. In the United States and Canada, dietary supplements are considered a subset of foods, and are regulated accordingly. The [[European Commission]] has also established harmonized rules to help insure that food supplements are safe and properly labeled.&lt;ref name="efsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/food-supplements|title=Food Supplements|publisher=European Food Safety Authority, European Commission|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other countries, the definition of dietary supplements may vary as [[drug]]s or other classes of ingredients used in supplement products.

&lt;!-- Industry --&gt;

&lt;!-- Regulation --&gt;
In the United States, it is against federal regulations for supplement manufacturers to [[health claim|claim]] that these products prevent or treat any disease. Companies are allowed to use what is referred to as "Structure/Function" wording if there is substantiation of scientific evidence for a supplement providing a potential health effect.&lt;ref name="s-f"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/ucm2006881.htm|title= Structure/Function Claims|publisher=Office of Dietary Supplement Programs, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be "_____ helps maintain healthy joints", but the label must bear a disclaimer that the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) "has not evaluated the claim and that the dietary supplement product is not intended to "diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease," because only a drug can legally make such a claim.&lt;ref name=s-f/&gt; The FDA enforces these regulations, and also prohibits the sale of supplements and supplement ingredients that are dangerous, or supplements not made according to standardized [[good manufacturing practice]]s (GMPs).

==Definition==
In the United States, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 provides this description: "The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) defines the term “dietary supplement” to mean a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, an amino acid, a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the aforementioned ingredients. Furthermore, a dietary supplement must be labeled as a dietary supplement and be intended for ingestion and must not be represented for use as conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or of the diet. In addition, a dietary supplement cannot be approved or authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biologic, unless it was marketed as a food or a dietary supplement before such approval or authorization. Under DSHEA, dietary supplements are deemed to be food, except for purposes of the drug definition."&lt;ref name=DietSupplLabels&gt;[https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-01-00120.pdf Dietary Supplement Labels: Key Elements] Office of Inspector General, Depart of Health and Human Services (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Per DSHEA, dietary supplements are consumed orally, and are mainly defined by what they are not: conventional foods (including meal replacements), [[medical food]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/UCM500094.pdf Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (May 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; [[preservative]]s or [[pharmaceutical drugs]]. Products intended for use as a nasal spray, or topically, as a lotion applied to the skin, do not qualify. FDA-approved drugs cannot be ingredients in dietary supplements.

==Types==

===Vitamins===
[[File:VitaminSupplementPills.jpg|thumb|right|Pharmacies and supermarkets in the U.S. sell a large variety of vitamin dietary supplements]]
{{main|Vitamin}}
A vitamin is an [[organic compound]] required by an [[organism]] as a vital [[nutrient]] in limited amounts.&lt;ref name="Lieberman"&gt;Lieberman, S and Bruning, N (1990). The Real Vitamin &amp; Mineral Book. NY: Avery Group, 3, {{ISBN|0-89529-769-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a vitamin when it cannot be [[biosynthesis|synthesized]] in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be obtained from the diet. The term is conditional both on the circumstances and on the particular organism. For example, [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C) is a vitamin for anthropoid primates, humans, guinea pigs and bats, but not for other mammals. Vitamin D is not an essential nutrient for people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, as then they synthesize vitamin D in skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Drouin G, Godin JR, Pagé B |title=The genetics of vitamin C loss in vertebrates |journal=Curr. Genomics |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=371–378 |year=2011 |pmid=22294879 |pmc=3145266 |doi=10.2174/138920211796429736 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules, "vitamers", (e.g. vitamin E includes tocopherols and tocotrienols, vitamin K includes vitamin K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The list: vitamins A, C, D, E, K, Thiamine (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), Pantothenic Acid (B5), Vitamin B6, Biotin (B7), Folate (B9) and Vitamin B12. Vitamin intake below recommended amounts can result in signs and symptoms associated with vitamin deficiency. There is little evidence of benefit when consumed as a dietary supplement by those who are healthy and consuming a nutritionally adequate diet.&lt;ref name=Fort2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fortmann|first=SP|author2=Burda, BU |author3=Senger, CA |author4=Lin, JS |author5= Whitlock, EP |title=Vitamin and Mineral Supplements in the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=Nov 12, 2013|pmid=24217421|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-159-12-201312170-00729|volume=159|issue=12|pages=824–834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Institute of Medicine sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for some of the vitamins. This does not prevent dietary supplement companies from selling products with content per serving higher than the ULs. For example, the UL for vitamin D is 100&amp;nbsp;µg (4,000 IU),&lt;ref name=IOM&gt;{{citation| title = Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs): Recommended Intakes for Individuals| publisher = Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academies| year = 2004| url = https://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-tables-and-application-reports| accessdate = 2009-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but products are available without prescription at 10,000 IU.

===Dietary minerals===
{{main|Mineral (nutrient)}}
Minerals are the [[exogenous]] [[chemical element]]s indispensable for life. Four minerals: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life but are so ubiquitous in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but for humans, not identified as having a recommended intake per se. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine. There are dietary supplements which provide sulfur, such as [[taurine]] and [[methylsulfonylmethane]].

The essential nutrient minerals for humans, listed in order by weight needed to be at the [[Dietary Reference Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] or [[Adequate Intake]] are [[potassium]], [[chlorine]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as [[boron]] and [[silicon]]. Essential and purportedly essential minerals are marketed as dietary supplements, individually and in combination with vitamins and other minerals.

Although as a general rule, dietary supplement labeling and marketing are not allowed to make disease prevention or treatment claims, the U.S. FDA has for some foods and dietary supplements reviewed the science, concluded that there is significant scientific agreement, and published specifically worded allowed health claims. An initial ruling allowing a health claim for calcium dietary supplements and osteoporosis was later amended to include calcium supplements with or without vitamin D, effective January 1, 2010. Examples of allowed wording are shown below. In order to qualify for the calcium health claim, a dietary supplement much contain at least 20% of the Reference Dietary Intake, which for calcium means at least 260&amp;nbsp;mg/serving.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2004-P-0205-0006 Food Labeling: Health Claims; Calcium and Osteoporosis, and Calcium, Vitamin D, and Osteoporosis] U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis."
*"Adequate calcium as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life."
*"Adequate calcium and vitamin D throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis."
*"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life."
In the same year, the European Food Safety Authority also approved a dietary supplement health claim for calcium and vitamin D and the reduction of the risk of osteoporotic fractures by reducing bone loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1609/epdf EFSA Journal 2010; 8(5):1609] EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA).&lt;/ref&gt;
The U.S. FDA also approved Qualified Health Claims (QHCs) for various health conditions for calcium, selenium and chromium picolinate.&lt;ref name=FDA-QHC&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm072756.htm Qualified Health Claims: Letters of Enforcement Discretion] U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; QHCs are supported by scientific evidence, but do not meet the more rigorous “significant scientific agreement” standard required for an authorized health claim. If dietary supplement companies choose to make such a claim then the FDA stipulates the exact wording of the QHC to be used on labels and in marketing materials. The wording can be onerous: "One study suggests that selenium intake may reduce the risk of bladder cancer in women. However, one smaller study showed no reduction in risk. Based on these studies, FDA concludes that it is highly uncertain that selenium supplements reduce the risk of bladder cancer in women."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20171114183712/https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm168527.htm Selenium and a Reduced Risk of Site-specific Cancers, FDA-2008-Q-0323] U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proteins and amino acids===
{{main|Protein (nutrient)|Amino acid}}

The same protein ingredients marketed as dietary supplements can be incorporated into [[meal replacement]] and [[medical food]] products, but those are regulated and labeled differently from supplements. In the United States, "meal replacement" products are foods and are labeled as such. These typically contain protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals. There may be content claims such as "good source of protein", "low fat" or "lactose free."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2004/53.html|title=Regulatory Issues: Meal Replacements – Convenience or Compromise?|publisher=Food Processing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical foods, also nutritionally complete, are designed to be used while a person is under the care of a physician or other licensed healthcare professional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/default.htm  Medical Foods Guidance Documents &amp; Regulatory Information] U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/ucm054048.htm Medical Foods - Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition] U.s.

Proteins are chains of [[amino acid]]s. Nine of these proteinogenic amino acids are considered essential for humans because they cannot be produced from other compounds by the human body and so must be taken in as food. Recommended intakes, expressed as milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day, have been established.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt"/&gt; Other amino acids may be conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions. Amino acids, individually and in combinations, are sold as dietary supplements.

===Essential fatty acids===
{{main|Essential fatty acids}}
Fish oil is a commonly used fatty acid supplement because it is a source of [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s.&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/|publisher=US National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements|title=Omega−3 Fatty Acids and Health: Fact Sheet for Health Professionals|date=2 November 2016|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatty acids are strings of carbon atoms, having a range of lengths. If links are all single (C-C), then the fatty acid is called ''[[saturated fat|saturated]]''; with one double bond (C=C), it is called ''[[monounsaturated fat|monounsaturated]]''; if there are two or more double bonds (C=C=C), it is called ''[[polyunsaturated fat|polyunsaturated]]''. Only two fatty acids, both polyunsaturated, are considered essential to be obtained from the diet, as the others are synthesized in the body. The "essential" fatty acids are [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, and [[linoleic acid]] (LA), an [[omega-6 fatty acid]].&lt;ref name=NIH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitney Ellie |author2=Rolfes SR | title = Understanding Nutrition | edition = 11th | location = California | publisher = Thomson Wadsworth | year = 2008 | pages = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALA can be elongated in the body to create other omega-3 fatty acids: [[eicosapentaenoic acid|eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]].

===Probiotics===
{{Main|Probiotic}}
In humans, the large intestine is host to more than 1,000 species of microorganisms, mostly bacteria, numbering in the tens of trillions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thursby E, Juge N |title=Introduction to the human gut microbiota |journal=Biochem. J. |volume=474 |issue=11 |pages=1823–1836 |year=2017 |pmid=28512250 |pmc=5433529 |doi=10.1042/BCJ20160510 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Probiotic]]" in the context of dietary supplements is the theory that by orally consuming specific live bacteria (or yeast) species, it is possible to influence the large intestine [[microbiota]], with consequent health benefits. Although there are numerous claimed benefits of using probiotic supplements, such as maintaining [[gastrointestinal]] health, in part by lowering risk of and severity of [[constipation]] or [[diarrhea]], and improving [[immune system|immune health]], including lower risk of and severity of acute upper respiratory tract infections, i.e., the [[common cold]], such claims are not all supported by sufficient clinical evidence.&lt;ref name="pro-ire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Probiotic Health Claims|url=https://www.fsai.ie/faq/probiotic_health_claims.html|publisher=Food Safety Authority of Ireland|accessdate=4 February 2018|date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bridging&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rijkers GT, de Vos WM, Brummer RJ, Morelli L, Corthier G, Marteau P | title = Health benefits and health claims of probiotics: Bridging science and marketing | journal = British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 106 | issue = 9 | pages = 1291–1296 | year = 2011 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/health-benefits-and-health-claims-of-probiotics-bridging-science-and-marketing/3C143B002B0289188B006FACA906E3BE/core-reader| pmid = 21861940 | doi = 10.1017/S000711451100287X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slashinski2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slashinski MJ, McCurdy SA, Achenbaum LS, Whitney SN, McGuire AL | title = "Snake-oil," "quack medicine," and "industrially cultured organisms:" biovalue and the commercialization of human microbiome research | journal = BMC Medical Ethics | volume = 13 | page = 28 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23110633 | pmc = 3512494 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6939-13-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review based on interviews with dozens of experts in microbiome research expressed concern about "...how biomedical research is co-opted by commercial entities that place profit over health."&lt;ref name=Slashinski2012/&gt; The concern is timely, as through 2021, probiotic supplements are expected to be the fastest growing segment of the dietary supplement market worldwide, while at the same time, the global health benefits market for probiotic-containing yogurt (a food, not a dietary supplement) is declining.&lt;ref name=crane/&gt;&lt;ref name="grebow"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grebow|first1=Jennifer|title=Probiotic Supplements Will Be the #1 Fastest-Growing Supplement in North America through 2021, Says Euromonitor at SupplySide West|url=http://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/digestive-health/probiotic-supplements-will-be-1-fastest-growing-supplement-north-america-through-2021-says|publisher=Nutritional Outlook|accessdate=4 February 2018|date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all dietary supplements, in the United States inappropriate label health claims such as preventing or treating disease are opposed by the FDA and deceptive advertisements by the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. Probiotic foods and dietary supplements are allowed to make claims using Structure:Function vocabulary as long as human trial evidence is adequate. In 2005, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to UAS Laboratories for disease treatment claims (colds, flu, ulcers, elevated blood cholesterol, colon cancer...). The company revised label and website content and continued to sell the product.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170112203014/http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2005/ucm075407.htm UAS Warning Letter, May 13, 2005] US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the company was found to have resumed the label and website claims, and the FDA seized product and stopped production.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170111235610/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm258155.htm FDA News Release, June 7, 2011] US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a FTC action was brought against a probiotic food company for exaggerated health claims, resulting in a multimillion-dollar fine and revisions to future advertising.&lt;ref name="ftc2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dannon Agrees to Drop Exaggerated Health Claims for Activia Yogurt and DanActive Dairy Drink FTC Charges that Evidence Supporting Benefits of Probiotics Falls Short|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2010/12/dannon-agrees-drop-exaggerated-health-claims-activia-yogurt|publisher=Federal Trade Commission, US Government|accessdate=9 May 2017|date=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Union a more restrictive approach has been taken by the [[European Food Safety Authority|EFSA]]. All proposed health claims were rejected on the grounds that the science was not sufficient, and no health claims are permitted. Foods with live microorganisms (yogurt, kefir) can be sold, but without claims.&lt;ref name=pro-ire/&gt;&lt;ref name="crane"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crane|first1=Michael|title=Crackdown on Probiotic Health Claims Costs Billions for EU Yogurt Industry|url=http://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/trends-business/crackdown-probiotic-health-claims-costs-billions-eu-yogurt-industry|publisher=Nutritional Outlook|accessdate=1 February 2018|date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probiotic supplements are generally regarded as safe. The greatest concern, evidenced by reviews reporting on case studies, is that for people with compromised gut wall integrity there may be a risk of systemic infection. For this reason, probiotic research is expected to exclude bacteria species that are antibiotic resistant.&lt;ref name=DoronSnydman2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Doron S, Snydman DR | title=Risk and safety of probiotics. | journal=Clin Infect Dis | year= 2015 | volume= 60 Suppl 2 | issue=  | pages= S129–S134 | pmid=25922398 | doi=10.1093/cid/civ085 | pmc=4490230 | url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/suppl_2/S129.long | type= Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DurchscheinPetritsch2016&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Durchschein F, Petritsch W, Hammer HF | title=Diet therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: The established and the new. | journal=World J Gastroenterol | year= 2016 | volume= 22 | issue= 7 | pages= 2179–2194 | pmid=26900283 | doi=10.3748/wjg.v22.i7.2179 | pmc=4734995 | url=http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/full/v22/i7/2179.htm | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==
In 2015, the American market for dietary supplements was valued at $37 billion,&lt;ref name=brodwin/&gt; with the [[Economic impact analysis|economic impact]] in the United States for 2016 estimated at $122 billion, including employment wages and taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supplement Industry Contributes $122 Billion To U.S. Economy|url=https://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/contents/view_online-exclusives/2016-06-10/supplement-industry-contributes-122-billion-to-us-economy|publisher=Nutraceuticals World|accessdate=1 February 2018|date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One 2016 analysis estimated the total market for dietary supplements could reach $278 billion worldwide by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report Forecasts Supplement Market to Reach $278 Billion by 2024|url=https://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/issues/2016-09/view_breaking-news/report-forecasts-supplement-market-to-reach-278-billion-by-2024/|publisher=Nutraceuticals World|accessdate=1 February 2018|date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
===Adulteration===
Over the period 2008 to 2011, the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) of the United States received 6,307 reports of health problems (identified as [[adverse event]]s) from use of dietary supplements containing a combination of ingredients in manufactured vitamins, minerals or other supplement products,&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Supplements: FDA May Have Opportunities to Expand Its Use of Reported Health Problems to Oversee Products|url=https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-244|publisher=Government Accountability Office, US Government|accessdate=2 February 2018|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 92% of tested herbal supplements containing [[lead]] and 80% containing other chemical contaminants.&lt;ref name="harmon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harmon|first1=Katherine|title=Herbal Supplement Sellers Dispense Dangerous Advice, False Claims|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/herbal-supplement-dangers/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=2 February 2018|date=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[undercover operation|undercover]] staff, the GAO also found that supplement retailers intentionally engaged in "unequivocal deception" to sell products advertised with baseless health claims, particularly to elderly consumers.&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt; [[Consumer Reports]] also reported unsafe levels of [[arsenic]], [[cadmium]], lead and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in several protein powder products.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Theglobeandmail.com_December_11_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/conditions/are-protein-shakes-the-weight-loss-magic-bullet/article596648/ |title=Are protein shakes the weight-loss magic bullet?|author=McGinn, Dave|publisher=The Globe and Mail (Toronto)|date= 26 March 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) reported that protein spiking, i.e., the addition of amino acids to manipulate protein content analysis, was common.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/marketplace-protein-powders-1.3313084 |title=Marketplace: Some protein powders fail fitness test|publisher= [[CBC News]] |first=Megan |last= Griffith-Greene |date= November 13, 2015 |accessdate= December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the companies involved challenged CBC's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/blog/supplements-company-statements |title=Supplements: Company statements|publisher= [[CBC News]] |date= November 13, 2015  |accessdate= December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study on herbal supplements found that many products were of low quality, one third did not contain the active ingredient(s) claimed, and one third contained unlisted substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1186/1741-7015-11-222|title=DNA barcoding detects contamination and substitution in North American herbal products|year=2013|last1=Newmaster|first1=Steven G|last2=Grguric|first2=Meghan|last3=Shanmughanandhan|first3=Dhivya|last4=Ramalingam|first4=Sathishkumar|last5=Ragupathy|first5=Subramanyam|journal=BMC Medicine|volume=11|pages=222|pmid=24120035|pmc=3851815}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Genetics|genetic]] analysis of herbal supplements, 78% of samples contained animal [[DNA]] that was not identified as an ingredient on the product labels.&lt;ref name=zhang/&gt; In some botanical products, undeclared ingredients were used to increase the bulk of the product and reduce its cost of manufacturing, while potentially violating certain religious and/or cultural limitations on consuming animal ingredients, such as cow, buffalo or deer.&lt;ref name=zhang/&gt; In 2015, the [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Attorney General]] identified four major retailers with dietary supplement products that contained fraudulent and potentially dangerous ingredients, requiring the companies to remove the products from retail stores.&lt;ref name="oconnor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connor|first1=Anahad|title=New York Attorney General Targets Supplements at Major Retailers|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/new-york-attorney-general-targets-supplements-at-major-retailers/|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=1 February 2018|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of dietary supplements sold between 2007 and 2016 identified 776 that contained unlisted [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, many of which could interact with other medications and lead to [[hospital]]ization.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web |title=Nearly 800 dietary supplements contained unapproved drug ingredients |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/health/tainted-dietary-supplements-fda-study/index.html|author=Susan Scutti|date=12 October 2018 |website=CNN |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 86% of the adulterated supplements were marketed for weight loss and sexual performance, with many containing prescription [[erectile dysfunction]] medication. [[Bodybuilding|Muscle building]] supplements were contaminated with [[anabolic steroid]]s, and multiple products contained [[antidepressant]]s and [[antihistamine]]s. Despite these findings, fewer than half of the adulterated supplements were recalled.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

===Litigation against false health claims===
The United States Food and Drug Administration, Office of Inspections, Compliance, Enforcement, and Criminal Investigations, monitors supplement products for accuracy in advertising and labeling, and when finding violations, [[FDA warning letter|warns]] manufacturers of impending enforcement action, including [[search and seizure]], [[injunction]], and/or financial penalties, such as for a [[Maine]] supplement company in 2017.&lt;ref name="mnh"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pace|first1=RM|title=Warning letter: Maine Natural Health, Inc.|url=https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2017/ucm590003.htm|publisher=Inspections, Compliance, Enforcement, and Criminal Investigations, US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=3 February 2018|date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Federal Trade Commission]], which litigates against deceptive advertising,&lt;ref name=ftc2010/&gt; established a consumer center to assist reports of false health claims in product advertising for dietary supplements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary supplement concerns?

==Adverse effects==
In the United States, manufacturers of dietary supplements are required to demonstrate safety of their products before approval is granted for commerce.&lt;ref name="ndi"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Dietary Ingredients in Dietary Supplements - Background for Industry|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/ucm109764.htm|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2 February 2018|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this caution, numerous adverse effects have been reported,&lt;ref name=gao/&gt; including muscle cramps, hair loss, joint pain, [[liver disease]], and [[allergy|allergic reactions]], with 29% of the adverse effects resulting in hospitalization, and 20% in serious injuries or illnesses.&lt;ref name=gao/&gt; By more than five-fold, the highest incidence of health problems derived from "combination products", whereas supplements for vitamins and minerals, lipid products, and herbal products were less likely to cause adverse effects.&lt;ref name=gao/&gt;

Among general reasons for the possible harmful effects of dietary supplements are: a) absorption in a short time, b) manufacturing quality and contamination, and c) enhancing both positive and negative effects at the same time.&lt;ref name=coghlan/&gt; The incidence of [[hepatotoxicity|liver injury]] from herbal and dietary supplements is about 16&amp;ndash;20% of all supplement products causing injury, with the occurrence growing globally over the early 21st century.&lt;ref name=navarro/&gt; The most common liver injuries from weight loss and bodybuilding supplements involve [[Hepatocyte|hepatocellular]] damage with resulting [[jaundice]], and the most common supplement ingredients attributed to these injuries are green tea [[catechin]]s, [[anabolic steroid]]s, and the herbal [[extract]], [[Aegle marmelos|aegeline]].&lt;ref name=navarro/&gt; Weight loss supplements have also had adverse [[psychiatry|psychiatric effects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4589574|year=2015|author1=Bersani|first1=F.

==Society and culture==

===Public health===
Work done by scientists in the early 20th century on identifying individual nutrients in food and developing ways to manufacture them raised hopes that optimal health could be achieved and diseases prevented by adding them to food and providing people with dietary supplements; while there were successes in preventing [[vitamin deficiencies]], and preventing conditions like [[neural tube defects]] by supplementation and [[food fortification]] with [[folic acid]], no targeted supplementation or fortification strategies to prevent major diseases like cancer or cardiovascular diseases have proved successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1001/jama.294.3.351|title=Essential Nutrients: Food or Supplements?|year=2005|last1=Lichtenstein|first1=Alice H.|authorlink1=Alice H.

For example, while increased consumption of fruits and vegetables are related to decreases in mortality, cardiovascular diseases and cancers, supplementation with key factors found in fruits and vegetable, like [[antioxidants]], vitamins, or minerals, do not help and some have been found to be harmful in some cases.&lt;ref name="GOVe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamine.asp |title=Vitamin E — Health Professional Fact Sheet |publisher=dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bjelakovic&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bjelakovic|first1=G|last2=Nikolova|first2=D|last3=Gluud|first3=LL|last4=Simonetti|first4=RG|last5=Gluud|first5=C|title=Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=14 March 2012|volume=3|issue=3|pages=CD007176|pmid=22419320|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007176.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general as of 2016, robust clinical data is lacking, that shows that any kind of dietary supplementation does more good than harm for people who are healthy and eating a reasonable diet but there is clear data showing that dietary pattern and lifestyle choices are associated with health outcomes.&lt;ref name=enough&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guallar E, Stranges S, Mulrow C, Appel LJ, Miller ER |title=Enough is enough: Stop wasting money on vitamin and mineral supplements |journal=Ann.

As a result of the lack of good data for supplementation and the strong data for dietary pattern, public health recommendations for [[healthy eating]] urge people to eat a [[plant-based diet]] of whole foods, minimizing processed food, salt and sugar and to get exercise daily, and to abandon [[Western pattern diet]]s and a sedentary lifestyle.&lt;ref name=katz&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katz DL, Meller S |title=Can we say what diet is best for health? |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=35 |pages=83–103 |year=2014 |pmid=24641555 |doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182351 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fitz"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fitzgerald M |title=Diet Cults: The Surprising Fallacy at the Core of Nutrition Fads and a Guide to Healthy Eating for the Rest of US |year=2014 |publisher=Pegasus Books |isbn=978-1-60598-560-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Legal regulation===

====United States====
{{Main|Regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}
The regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is governed by various statutes enacted by the [[United States Congress]] and interpreted by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] ("FDA"). Pursuant to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] ("the Act")  and accompanying legislation, the FDA has authority to oversee the quality of substances sold as [[food]] in the [[United States]], and to monitor claims made in the [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]] about both the composition and the [[health]] benefits of foods.

Substances which the FDA regulates as food are subdivided into various categories, including foods, [[food additive]]s, added substances (man-made substances which are not intentionally introduced into food, but nevertheless end up in it), and dietary supplements. The specific standards which the FDA exercises differ from one category to the next. Furthermore, the FDA has been granted a variety of means by which it can address violations of the standards for a given category of substances.

Dietary supplement manufacture is required to comply with the good manufacturing practices established in 2007. The FDA can visit manufacturing facilities, send [[FDA warning letter|Warning Letters]]&lt;ref name=mnh/&gt; if not in compliance with GMPs, stop production, and if there is a health risk, require that the company conduct a recall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/CGMP/ucm079496.htm Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) for Dietary Supplements] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Union====
The [[European Union]]'s (EU) Food Supplements Directive of 2002 requires that supplements be demonstrated to be safe, both in dosages and in purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0046:EN:HTML |title=Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only those supplements that have been proven to be safe may be sold in the EU without prescription. As a category of food, food supplements cannot be labeled with drug claims but can bear [[health claim]]s and nutrition claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/index_en.htm |title=European Commission website: Food Safety – Labelling &amp; Nutrition – Health &amp; Nutrition Claims |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dietary supplements industry in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), one of the 28 countries in the bloc, strongly opposed the Directive. In addition, a large number of consumers throughout Europe, including over one million in the UK, and various doctors and scientists, had signed petitions by 2005 against what are viewed by the petitioners as unjustified restrictions of consumer choice.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2598585.ece|first=Sam |last=Knight |title=Controversial EU vitamins ban to go ahead|publisher= [[The Times Online]] |date=2005-07-12 |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, along with two British trade associations, the [[Alliance for Natural Health]] (ANH) had a legal challenge to the Food Supplements Directive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/supplements/index_en.htm|title=Food supplements - Food Safety - European Commission|website=Food Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to the [[European Court of Justice]] by the High Court in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3445503.stm |title='Court victory for vitamin firms' |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-01-30 |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the European Court of Justice's Advocate General subsequently said that the bloc's plan to tighten rules on the sale of [[vitamins]] and food supplements should be scrapped,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4411929.stm |title='EU health foods crackdown 'wrong'&amp;#39; |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-04-05 |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was eventually overruled by the European Court, which decided that the measures in question were necessary and appropriate for the purpose of protecting [[public health]]. ANH, however, interpreted the ban as applying only to synthetically produced supplements, and not to vitamins and minerals normally found in or consumed as part of the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4670971.stm |title='Vitamin controls backed by Europe' |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-07-12 |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the European judges acknowledged the Advocate General's concerns, stating that there must be clear procedures to allow substances to be added to the permitted list based on scientific evidence. They also said that any refusal to add the product to the list must be open to challenge in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1526892,00.html |title='EU court backs health supplements ban' |publisher=Guardian |date=2005-07-12 |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Examples of ongoing government research organizations to better understand the potential health properties and safety of dietary supplements are the [[European Food Safety Authority]],&lt;ref name=efsa/&gt; the Office of Dietary Supplements of the United States [[National Institutes of Health]],&lt;ref name=odsfaqs/&gt;&lt;ref name="dwyer"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=29300341|year=2018|author1=Dwyer|first1=J.

===Databases===
As continual research on the properties of supplements accumulates, databases or fact sheets for various supplements are updated regularly, including the Dietary Supplement Label Database,&lt;ref name=odsdata/&gt; Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database,&lt;ref name="dsid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database|url=https://dietarysupplementdatabase.usda.nih.gov/|publisher=Office of Dietary Supplements, US National Institutes of Health and US Department of Agriculture, National Nutrient Database|accessdate=3 February 2018|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dietary Supplement Facts Sheets of the United States.&lt;ref name="ods-facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheets|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-all/|publisher=Office of Dietary Supplements, US National Institutes of Health|date=2018|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada where a license is issued when a supplement product has been proven by the manufacturer and government to be safe, effective and of sufficient quality for its recommended use, an eight-digit Natural Product Number is assigned and recorded in a Licensed Natural Health Products Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licensed Natural Health Products Database|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/natural-non-prescription/applications-submissions/product-licensing/licensed-natural-health-products-database.html|publisher=Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate, Government of Canada|accessdate=3 February 2018|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] maintains a [[compendium]] of botanical ingredients used in manufacturing of dietary supplements.&lt;ref name=efsa-comp/&gt;

In 2015, the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published the results of a review of herbal supplements to determine if any were suitable for coverage by [[health insurance]].&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government – Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S.

===Quality and safety===
To assure supplements have sufficient quality, standardization, and safety for public consumption, research efforts have focused on development of reference materials for supplement manufacturing and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measurements and Standards for Botanical Dietary Supplements|url=https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/measurements-and-standards-botanical-dietary-supplements|publisher=US National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=3 February 2018|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="efsa-comp"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=European Food Safety Authority|title=Compendium of botanicals reported to contain naturally occuring &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; substances of possible concern for human health when used in food and food supplements|journal=EFSA Journal|year=2012|volume=10|issue=5|page=2663|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2663|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2663/epdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-dose products have received research attention,&lt;ref name=dwyer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4288271|year=2015|author1=Dwyer|first1=J.

===Population monitoring===
In the United States, the [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES) has investigated habits of using dietary supplements in context of total nutrient intakes from the diet in adults and children.&lt;ref name=dwyer/&gt; Over the period of 1999 to 2012, use of multivitamins decreased, and there was wide variability in the use of individual supplements among subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=5540241|year=2016|author1=Kantor|first1=E.

===Clinical studies===
Research initiatives to improve knowledge of the possible health benefits of supplementing with essential nutrients to lower disease risk have been extensive. As examples, just in 2017 were reviews on
*[[vitamin D]], providing evidence for protection against acute [[respiratory tract infection]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=5310969|year=2017|author1=Martineau|first1=A.

===Absence of benefit===
The potential benefit of using essential nutrient dietary supplements to lower the risk of diseases has been refuted by findings of no effect or weak evidence in numerous clinical reviews, such as for cardiovascular diseases,&lt;ref name=an2017/&gt; cancer,&lt;ref name=an2017/&gt; [[HIV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=5458097|year=2017|author1=Visser|first1=M.

===Reporting bias===
A review of clinical trials registered at [[clinicaltrials.gov]], which would include both drugs and supplements, reported that nearly half of completed trials were sponsored wholly or partially by industry.&lt;ref name=Dunn2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dunn AG, Coiera E |title=Should comparative effectiveness research ignore industry-funded data? |journal=J Comp Eff Res |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=317–320 |year=2014 |pmid=25275226 |doi=10.2217/cer.14.31 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not automatically imply bias, but there is evidence that because of selective non-reporting, results in support of a potential drug or supplement ingredient are more likely to be published than results that do not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit.&lt;ref name=Dunn2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Knottnerus JA, Tugwell P |title=The potential impact of unpublished results |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=66 |issue=10 |pages=1061–1063 |year=2013 |pmid=23993310 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.08.001 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One review reported that fewer than half of the registered clinical trials resulted in publication in peer-reviewed journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zarin DA, Tse T, Sheehan J |title=The proposed rule for U.S. clinical trial registration and results submission |journal=N.

===Future===
Improving public information about use of dietary supplements involves investments in professional training programs, further studies of population and nutrient needs, expanding the database information, enhancing collaborations between governments and universities, and translating dietary supplement research into useful information for consumers, [[health professional]]s, scientists, and policymakers.&lt;ref name="ods-strat"&gt;{{cite web|title=ODS Strategic Plan 2017-2021|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/About/StrategicPlan2017-2021.aspx|publisher=Office of Dietary Supplements, US National Institutes of Health|accessdate=3 February 2018|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future demonstration of efficacy from use of dietary supplements requires high-quality [[clinical research]] using rigorously-qualified products and compliance with established guidelines for reporting of clinical trial results (e.g., [[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials|CONSORT guidelines]]).&lt;ref name=dwyer/&gt;

'''Economic Instruments''' for [[water policies]] are tools based on incentives ad disincentives; they change conditions to enable economic transactions or reduce risk, aiming at increasing [[environmental quality]].

In a world of ever increasing [[water demand]] and decline in [[water resources|water availability]] and/or reliability, where water-related hazards are on rise, where [[climate change]] threatens to undo decades of development efforts, the only way to sustainability is a right mix of mutually strengthening policy instruments. In this policy mix, '''Economic Policy Instruments''' (EPIs) are best suited to foster an efficient allocation and use of water, reduce harmful exposure and impacts on the communities and environment, and protect [[natural capital]].
EPIs are regulations that encourage behaviour through market signals rather than through explicit directives”.&lt;ref&gt;Stavins, R. N. “Experience with market-based environmental policy instruments.” In: Handbook of Environmental Economics, edited by Karl-Göran Mäler and Jeffrey Vincent, 1:355–435. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; They are a means of correcting market signals in order to convey the costs of externalities to economic actors (individuals as well as firms) which have generated them. Regarding water policies, economic instruments comprise regulations like those creating virtual market conditions (tradable permits), charges for public services, payments for [[ecosystem services]], and transfer payments such as incentives based on taxation, levies, fees and royalties and subsidies. They represent an alternative to more traditional command and control instruments. Whereas already introduced into climate policies, air quality and energy policies, their application to water policies represents some specific challenges.

In [[Environmental Policy]], economic instruments have received increasing attention over the last decades, and have been implemented to achieve environmental policy objectives such as climate policy under the form of [[Emission Trading]]. However, although EPIs have been proved to perform better than alternative instruments (command and control instruments or voluntary agreements) in other domains of environmental policies, their application to tackle water management issues ([[drought]]/[[water scarcity]], [[flood]]s, and [[water quality]]) are beset by many difficulties both of practical and ethical character: Despite the Dublin statement on sustainable water management adopted by the UN in 1992 which stating, in its fourth principle, that "Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an economic good"&lt;ref&gt;THE DUBLIN STATEMENT
ON WATER AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/hwrp/documents/english/icwedece.html&lt;/ref&gt; the conception of water as an economic (and tradable) good is not accepted unanimously; especially Human rights groups see this principle in contradiction to the [[Right to water]].

== Categories of instruments ==

=== Water tariffs ===
Charges for the use of water are among the best known economic instruments for water policies. They can contribute to the transmission of  market signals which are coherent with policy aims, if their design is transparent and revenues are earmarked to uses connected to the service or to the mitigation of impacts from water uses. Charges for water uses potentially aim at different objectives: (a) redistribution the costs water service operators bear for water related services among the users,  cover costs for service provision; (b) distribute social costs of resource uses, for instance environmental costs, among users, (c) attribute water uses to the economically most efficient type of uses according to their ability to pay for water uses.

== Environmental taxes ==
Taxes on the use of water as an environmental good, for instance on the use of ground water, can help internalizing negative environmental impacts and/or collect fincnacial resources for the public budget. The earmarking of environmental taxes (making the use of the resources collected transparent and coherent to the environmental function of the tax) is a central issue for the acceptance of the tool.

Like environmental taxes, charges can transmit signals for internalizing negative environmental impacts and influence behaviour, and to collect financial resources that are allocated to support environmental friendly practices and projects.

=== Tradable permits ===
As water normally is not a traded good, the establishment of specific rights or tradeable permits are a means for using market mechanisms for the allocation of limited water resources. Creating  virtual markets tradeable permits for water uses can improve the allocation (increase the efficiency) of resources to the economically most efficient uses. Virtual markets can be created either with regards to quantities of water to be used/abstracted or levels of pollution conceded to potential polluters.

=== Subsidies on products or practices ===
Direct or indirect subsidies of water uses aim mostly at increasing the attractiveness of "green" products, production factors that have limited negative environmental impacts on water resources or produce positive environmental externalities.

== Compensation mechanisms ==
Payments and charges on the deterioration of environmental goods can be substituted by mechanisms where environmental degradation leads to financial payment that is allocated to alternative actions to compensate for the degradation. Compensation can also be provided by third parties, for instance insurances.

=== Payment for ecosystem services ===
Water bodies provide [[ecosystem services]] consisting of [[flood protection]], [[biodiversity]] support and remediation. These functions are generally not considered as economic benefits, although they are used as inputs for social activities. [[Payment for ecosystem services|Introduction of payment schemes]] can potentially support the maintenance of natural functions of water bodies.

== Evaluating Economic Policy Instruments for Water Policies ==

The [http://www.feem-project.net/epiwater/index.html EPI-WATER] research project funded by the founded by [[European Commission]] under the 7th [[Framework Programme]], sets to assess the effectiveness and the efficiency of Economic Policy Instruments in achieving water policy goals, and to identify the preconditions under which they complement or perform better than alternative (e.g. regulatory or voluntary) policy instruments. Using a common multi-dimensional assessment framework, the project will compare the performance of single economic instruments or their apposite combinations with the performance otherwise achievable with regulatory (command &amp; control) interventions (such as water restriction/rationing, licensing or permitting), persuasive instruments or voluntary commitments. Furthermore the project will identify remaining research and methodological issues that need to be addressed, in particular with regards to the further development and use of national accounting, for supporting the design, implementation and evaluation of EPI in the field of water management.

The assessment is based on the analysis of case studies on experiences for the implementation of economic policy instruments for water policies throughout European Member states and beyond and on ex post simulation of impacts and environmental outcomes of the application of selected instruments to water policy issues in EU member states. 
The project is coordinated by [http://www.feem.it Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei].

==Early years==
She was born in [[Cape Coast]], [[Ghana]], where she attended [[Wesley Girls' High School]].&lt;ref name=Hussein /&gt; She moved to London at the age of 19 to study nursing, and eventually earned a master's degree at the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine]] and a research fellowship at [[City University London]].&lt;ref name=Kramer&gt;Jane Kramer, [http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/postscript-efua-dorkenoo-1949-2014 "Postscript: Efua Dorkenoo, 1949-2014"], ''The New Yorker'', 23 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a staff nurse at various hospitals, including the [[Royal Free Hospital|Royal Free]],&lt;ref name=Hussein /&gt; and it was while training as a midwife that she became aware of the impact of FGM on women's lives.&lt;ref name=Times /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Batha, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/20/us-foundation-britain-fgm-dorkenoo-idUSKCN0I91HV20141020 "Anti-FGM campaigners mourn death of pioneer Efua Dorkenoo"], Reuters, 20 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigning work==
She joined the [[Minority Rights Group]] and travelled to various parts of Africa to gather information for what was one of the earliest reports published on FGM in 1980.&lt;ref name=Times /&gt; In 1983 she founded the [[Foundation for Women's Health, Research and Development]] (FORWARD), a British NGO that supports women who have experienced FGM and tries to eliminate the practice.&lt;ref name=Forward&gt;[http://www.forwarduk.org.uk/about "About Us"], FORWARD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Equality&gt;[http://www.equalitynow.org/people/efua_dorkenoo "Efua Dorkenoo"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304151830/http://www.equalitynow.org/people/efua_dorkenoo |date=2015-03-04 }}, Equality Now.&lt;/ref&gt; She began working with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 1995 and was the acting director for women’s health there until 2001.&lt;ref name=Kramer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Martin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/health/efua-dorkenoo-dies-at-65-key-foe-of-genital-cutting.html?_r=0 "Efua Dorkenoo, Who Campaigned Against Genital Cutting, Dies at 65"], ''The New York Times'', 27 october 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ella Alexander, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/efua-dorkenoo-dead-influential-fgm-womens-rights-campaigner-dies-aged-65-9806894.html "Efua Dorkenoo dead: Influential FGM women’s rights campaigner dies, aged 65"], ''The Independent'', 20 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She was Advocacy Director and, subsequently, Senior FGM Advisor for [[Equality Now]] (an international human rights organization).&lt;ref name=Kramer /&gt; She was close friends with [[Alice Walker]], advising on and featured in the documentary film ''Warrior Marks'' (1993) made by Walker and [[Pratibha Parmar]]&lt;ref&gt;Tobe Levin, [http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/2009/04/founder-of-forward-efua-dorkenoo/ "Founder of FORWARD: Efua Dorkenoo"], Our Bodies Ourselves.&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Gloria Steinem]], who wrote an introduction to Dorkenoo's 1994 book ''Cutting the Rose: Female Genital Mutilation''.&lt;ref name=Kramer /&gt;

==Honours and recognition==

The '''Federal Biomedical Agency'''  or '''FMBA''' ('''Федеральное медико-биологическое агентство, ФМБА России''') is the national public health institute of the [[Russian Federation]]. The agency is a [[Government agency|federal agency]] under the [[Ministry of Health]] and is headquartered in Volokolamsk Highway, in [[Moscow]].

The FMBA was known previously as Federal Directorate for biomedical and Extremal problems until October 11, 2004 when it was renamed into the current name. During the Soviet regime, since 1947, the Third Main Directorate of the Health Care ministry was responsible for such duties; While during the Czarist regime, especially since 1802, the Epidemic Police and the Medical Department of [[MVD]] were responsible for such functions.

Today, Its main goal is to protect [[public health]] and safety through the control and prevention of disease, injury, and disability. The Agency (FMBA) focuses national attention on developing and applying disease control and prevention. It especially focuses its attention on [[infectious disease]], [[Foodborne illness|food borne pathogens]], [[environmental health]], [[occupational safety and health]], [[health promotion]], [[injury prevention]] and educational activities designed to improve the health of [[Russian citizens]]. In addition, the FMBA researches and provides information on [[non-infectious diseases]]. The Agency is also responsible for the Russian [[blood bank]].

== Structure ==

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2007">'''Fixation disparity''' exists when there is a small misalignment  of the eyes when viewing with [[binocular vision]]. The misaligment may be vertical, horizontal or both. The misalignment (a few [[minute of arc|minutes of arc]]) is much smaller than that of [[strabismus]], which prevents binocular vision, although it may reduce a patient's level of [[stereopsis]]. A patient may or may not have fixation disparity and a patient may have a different fixation disparity at distance than near.

==Measurement of fixation disparity==
There are several methods to quantify fixation disparity. The Mallett card, the Bernell lantern slide, the Wesson Card and the Disparometer may be used. A patient's [[associated phoria]] is the amount of prism needed to reduce their fixation disparity to zero minutes of arc.

The Mallett Fixation Disparity Unit

Instrument used to measure the associated heterophoria (or compensating prism). It consists of a small central fixation letter X surrounded by two letters O, one on each side of X, the three letters being seen binocularly, and two coloured polarized vertical bars in line with the centre of the X which are seen by each eye separately. The instrument can be swung through 90° to measure any vertical fixation disparity. The associated phoria is indicated by the misalignment of the two polarized bars when the subject fixates the X through cross-polarized filters in front of the eyes. The amount of associated phoria is given by the value of the base-in or base-out prism power necessary to produce alignment and the eye. The unit can also be used to detect suppression. See Disparometer; associated heterophoria; uncompensated heterophoria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4983">The '''Freedom to Breathe Act''' of 2007 is a piece of [[Minnesota]] legislation that restricts the act of smoking [[tobacco]] products in public places. It amends sections of [[Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act]] (MCIAA) of 1975.
[[Image:no smoking 2007.jpg|thumb]]

==Contents of Act &amp; Controversy==
On May 16, 2007, the [[United States of America|U.S.]] state of Minnesota passed the '''Freedom to Breathe Act'''. This act protects the public from hazardous secondhand smoke by banning smoking in public places. The ban took effect October 1, 2007. Minnesota is the 17th state to enforce a statewide smoking ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Put 'Em Out: Minnesota Smoking Ban Kicks In Monday | publisher = WCCO | url = http://wcco.com/health/local_story_272145441.html | date = 29 September 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227004710/http://wcco.com/health/local_story_272145441.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original and major supporters of the 1975 regulations are very pleased to see the new doctrine pass through legislation and sign into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Smoking ban takes effect | publisher = The Minnesota Daily| url = http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2007/10/02/72163623. | date = 2 October 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071130001432/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2007/10/02/72163623 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an inForum online article, Don Davis quoted several House Republicans against the bill. Representative Bud Heidgerken, ([[Republican Party of Minnesota|R]]-[[Freeport, Minnesota|Freeport]]), says that the ban will hurt small enterprises and presented a kink in the State's plan. He stated, "You are going to vote them out of business tonight."  Likewise, Dennis Ozment, ([[Republican Party of Minnesota|R]]-[[Rosemount, Minnesota|Rosemount]]), stated that the passage of the bill is "tyranny, oppressive governmental power... This piece of legislation turned out to be just plain mean," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Minnesota Freedom to Breathe Act  | publisher = www.mnBlueCrossTobacco.com | url = http://www.mnbluecrosstobacco.com/freedom-to-breathe-act/ | date = October 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precedence==
The 2007 anti-smoking act was not the first in the state to pass into law. The Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act (MCIAA) took in effect 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act  | publisher = Minnesota Department of Health | url = http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/mciaa/ftb/index.html | year = 1975 | accessdate = 2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this act was to enforce the "protection of the public health." It prohibited smoking in areas where children, ill or injured are present. This first Minnesota act also limited smoking indoor at public places and private meetings.

==Exemptions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act  | publisher = Elisabeth Klarqvist | url = http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/ss/ssmciaa.pdf | date = August 2017 | accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Smoking is permitted in the following places:
* Specified rooms in residential health care facilities
* Separated, well-ventilated areas of locked psychiatric units
* Specified areas for use in peer-reviewed scientific studies related to smoking
* Private homes and residences when they are not in use as a place of employment
* Hotel and motel guest rooms
* Tobacco products shops for the purpose of sampling products
* Heavy commercial vehicles
* Farm vehicles and construction equipment
* Buildings on family farms
* Disabled veterans' rest camp
* Smoking is also permitted by Native Americans as part of a traditional Native American spiritual or cultural ceremony and by actors as part of a theatrical performance.
* Smoking outside, unless it is limited or prohibited by local government.

==Definition of 'Indoors'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act  | publisher = Elisabeth Klarqvist | url = http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/ss/ssmciaa.pdf | date = August 2017 | accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
An indoor area is defined as the space between a floor and a ceiling that is bounded by walls covering more than 50 percent of the perimeter of the area. Temporary physical barriers are considered walls, but certain window screens are not.

"'''Hair of the dog'''", short for "'''Hair of the dog that bit you'''", is a [[colloquialism|colloquial]] expression in the English language  predominantly used to refer to [[alcohol]] that is consumed with the aim of lessening the effects of a [[hangover]].

==Etymology==
The expression originally referred to a method of treatment of a [[rabies|rabid]] dog bite by placing hair from the dog in the bite wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26229 |title=Hair of the dog definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ebenezer Cobham Brewer]] writes in the ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' (1898): "In [[Scotland]] it is a popular belief that a few hairs of the dog that bit you applied to the wound will prevent evil consequences. Applied to drinks, it means, if overnight you have indulged too freely, take a glass of the same wine within 24 hours to soothe the nerves. 'If this dog do you bite, soon as out of your bed, take a hair of the tail the next day.'"  He also cites two [[apocrypha]]l poems containing the phrase, one of which is attributed to  [[Aristophanes]]. It is possible that the phrase was used to justify an existing practice, as the idea of  "like cures like" ({{lang-la|[[similia similibus curantur]]}}) dates back at least to the time of [[Hippocrates]]. It exists today as the basic postulate of [[homeopathy|classical homeopathy]]. In the 1930s cocktails known as [[Corpse Reviver]]s were served in hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallscreennetwork.com/video/434 |title=Corpse Reviver #2 Cocktail - The Cocktail Spirit with Robert Hess - Small Screen™ Cocktail Recipes, Bartending and Mixology and Cooking Videos |publisher=Smallscreennetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known reference to the phrase "hair of the dog" in connection with drunkenness is found in a text from ancient [[Ugarit]] dating from the mid to late second millennium BC,  in which the god ʾIlu becomes hungover after a drinking binge. The text includes a recipe for a salve to be applied to the god's forehead, which consists of "hairs of a dog" and parts of an unknown plant mixed with olive oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pardee|first1=Dennis|title=ʾIlu On A Toot (Context of Scripture 1.97)|date=1997|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9004106189|pages=304–5|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/context-of-scripture/ilu-on-a-toot-1-97-aCOSB_1_97|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of modern usage (''poil de ce chien'') can be found in [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]]' 16th century pentology [[Gargantua and Pantagruel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabelais|first=|title=La Vie de Gargantua et Pantagruel Book 5|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=PRxnAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA529&amp;dq=La+vie+de+Gargantua+et+de+Pantagruel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSj_Cp8ZfPAhUqD8AKHdZgDN0Q6AEISzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=poils%20du%20chien&amp;f=false|page=Chapter XLVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally translated by [[Peter Anthony Motteux|Motteux]] in the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabelais|first=|title=[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]] Book 5|date=1694|page=Chapter XLVI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other languages==
The phrase also exists in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], where the literal translation to English is "(You may cure) the dog's bite with its fur", but has evolved into a short phrase ("kutyaharapást szőrével") that is used frequently in other contexts when one is trying to express that the solution to a problem is more of the problem. Among the [[Irish people|Irish]] and Mexicans, the phrase 'The Cure' ("curarse la cruda", in Spanish) is often used instead of 'hair of the dog'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevenroyedwards.com/drunkinirish.html |title=How to talk about alcohol in the Republic of Ireland |publisher=Stevenroyedwards.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used, often sarcastically, in the question "Going for a Cure?"  In Costa Rica (Central America), the same expression is used but it refers to a pig as in: hair of the same pig ("pelos de la misma chancha" in Central America) referring to the same method to cure the hangover.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In some Slavic languages (Polish, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian and Russian), hair of the dog is called "a wedge" (''klin''), mirroring the concept of dislodging a stuck wedge with another one; hence the popular Polish phrase "[to dislodge] a wedge [with] a wedge"  &amp;ndash; ''[wybijać] klin klinem'' &amp;ndash; which is used figuratively both with regard to alcohol and in other contexts. In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the phrase is "Клин клин избива". The proper Russian term is [[:wikt:ru:опохмелка|опохмелка]] (opohmelka, "after being drunk"), which indicates a process of drinking to decrease effects of drinking the day before.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In German, drinking alcohol the next morning to relieve the symptoms is sometimes described as "having a counter-beer" (ein Konterbier trinken), whereas in Austria people talk about having a repair-beer (Reparatur-Seidl). In Portuguese, people speak of "a hit" (uma rebatida), meaning to strike away (the hangover with more alcohol).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A similar usage is encountered in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], in the phrase "Cui pe cui se scoate" (''A nail (fastener) pulls out a nail''); in  [[Italian language|Italian]], in the phrase "Chiodo schiaccia chiodo"; in  [[Spanish language|Spanish]], in the phrase "Un clavo saca otro clavo" (''A nail pulls out another nail''); and in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], in the phrase "Çivi çiviyi söker". In all five cases, the English translation is "a nail dislodges a nail", though these phrases are not exclusively used to refer to the hangover cure.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In Swedish, drinking alcohol to relieve a hangover is called having an "''återställare''", which translates roughly to "restorer". In Norwegian, it is usually called "repareringspils", meaning a "beer to repair". In Finnish, it is called "tasoittava" (smoothening) or "korjaussarja" (repair kit) and in Czech "vyprošťovák" (extricator). In Tanzania, the equivalent Swahili phrase used is "kuzimua" which means 'assist to wake up after a coma'.

In Danish, a beer the day after drinking, is called a "reparationsbajer", which translates to "repair beer". There is also a saying: "One must rise at the tree where one fell".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In Korea, alcohol (typically soju) drunk in the morning to relieve hangovers is called "haejangsul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dic.daum.net/word/view.do?wordid=kew000082425&amp;q=%ED%95%B4%EC%9E%A5%EC%88%A0 |language=Korean |title=해장술 |publisher=Kumsung Publishing Co. |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, alcohol drunk to relieve hangover is called "回魂酒", literally translates to "the drink that brings back your soul".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=回魂酒有用嗎？醫：僅限於酒精成癮者|url=http://www.healthnews.com.tw/readnews.php?id=11947|website=健康醫療網|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;The phrase also exists in (Cheng) Swahili Slang: In Kenya taking alcohol to relieve a hangover is called " Kutoa Lock" Translated into "removing the Lock"

==Scientific background==
There are at least two hypotheses as to how "hair of the dog" works:

In the first, hangovers are described as the first stage of alcohol withdrawal, which is then alleviated by further alcohol intake. Although  "...Low [ethanol] doses may effectively prevent alcohol withdrawal syndrome in surgical patients",&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|819502|Withdrawal Syndromes|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt; this idea is questionable as the signs and symptoms of hangover and alcohol withdrawal are very different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wiese |first1=Jeffrey G. |last2=Shlipak |first2=Michael G. |last3=Browner |first3=Warren S. |title=The Alcohol Hangover |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=132 |issue=11 |pages=897–902 |year=2000 |pmid=10836917 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-132-11-200006060-00008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second, hangovers are attributed to [[methanol]] metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=A. W. |title=Elimination Half-life of Methanol During Hangover |journal=Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=217–20 |year=1987 |pmid=3588516 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0773.1987.tb01737.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Calder |first1=Ian |title=Hangovers: Not the ethanol—perhaps the methanol |journal=BMJ |volume=314 |issue=7073 |pages=2–3 |year=1997 |pmid=9001463 |pmc=2125562 |doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7073.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of methanol, present as a [[Congener (alcohol)|congener]] in alcohol, have been correlated with severity of hangover&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chapman |first1=Loring F. |title=Experimental induction of hangover |journal=Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol |volume=5 |issue=Suppl 5 |pages=67–86 |year=1970 |pmid=5450666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pawan |first1=GL |title=Alcoholic drinks and hangover effects |journal=The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=15A |year=1973 |pmid=4760771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and methanol metabolism to the highly toxic formate via formaldehyde&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marx |first1=Christopher J. |last2=Van Dien |first2=Stephen J. |last3=Lidstrom |first3=Mary E. |title=Flux Analysis Uncovers Key Role of Functional Redundancy in Formaldehyde Metabolism |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=e16 |year=2005 |pmid=15660163 |pmc=539335 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; coincides with the rate of appearance of hangover symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Ylikahri RH, Huttunen M, Eriksson CJ, Nikkila EA. Metabolic studies on the pathogenesis of hangover. ''Eur J Clin Invest'' 1974;4:93–100&lt;/ref&gt; As both ethanol and methanol are metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase – and ethanol is a much better substrate for this enzyme – drinking more of the former then effectively prevents (or delays) the metabolism of the latter. As pure ethanol consumption has also been found to increase endogenous levels of methanol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bendtsen |first1=Preben |last2=Jones |first2=A. Wayne |last3=Helander |first3=Anders |title=Urinary excretion of methanol and 5-hydroxytryptophol as biochemical markers of recent drinking in the hangover state |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=431–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9719404 |url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9719404 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.alcalc.a008415}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably for this reason, this suggests that if "hair of the dog" works in this way it effects a temporary hiatus rather than a cure.{{clarify|date=March 2012}}

'''Health physics''' is the [[applied physics]] of [[radiation protection]] for [[health]] and [[health care]] purposes. It is the science concerned with the recognition, evaluation, and control of health hazards to permit the safe use and application of [[ionizing radiation]]. Health physics professionals promote excellence in the science and practice of radiation protection and safety.  Health physicists principally work at facilities where [[radionuclide]]s or other sources of ionizing radiation (such as [[X-ray generator]]s) are used or produced; these include hospitals, government laboratories, academic and research institutions, nuclear power plants, regulatory agencies, and manufacturing plants.

==Scope==
There are many sub-specialties in the field of health physics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hps.org/publicinformation/hpcareers.html Careers in Health Physics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; including

* [[Ionising radiation]] instrumentation and measurement

* [[Radioactive waste]] management
* [[Radioactive contamination]], decontamination and decommissioning
* Radiological [[engineering]] (shielding, holdup, etc.)
* Environmental assessment, radiation monitoring and radon evaluation
* Operational [[radiation protection]]/health physics

=== Operational health physics ===
The subfield of operational health physics, also called applied health physics in older sources, focuses on field work and the practical application of health physics knowledge to real-world situations, rather than basic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Kenneth L.|date=July 2005|title=Operational Health Physics|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7850780_Operational_health_physics|journal=Health Physics|volume=88|issue=6|pages=638–652|doi=10.1097/01.hp.0000138021.37701.30|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical physics===
The field of Health Physics is related to the field of [[medical physics]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aapm.org/medical_physicist/fields.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and they are similar to each other in that practitioners rely on much of the same fundamental science (i.e., radiation physics, biology, etc.) in both fields. Health physicists, however, focus on the evaluation and protection of human health from radiation, whereas medical health physicists and medical physicists support the use of radiation and other physics-based technologies by medical practitioners for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapm.org/medical_physicist/default.asp AAPM - The Medical Physicist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiation protection instruments==
Practical ionising radiation measurement is essential for health physics. It enables the evaluation of protection measures, and the assessment of the radiation dose likely, or actually received by individuals. The provision of such instruments is normally controlled by law.  In the UK it is the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999.

The measuring instruments for radiation protection are both "installed" (in a fixed position) and portable (hand-held or transportable).

===Installed instruments===
Installed instruments are fixed in positions which are known to be important in assessing the general radiation hazard in an area. Examples are installed "area" radiation monitors, Gamma interlock monitors, personnel exit monitors, and airborne contamination monitors.

The area monitor will measure the ambient radiation, usually X-Ray, Gamma or neutrons; these are radiations which can have significant radiation levels over a range in excess of tens of metres from their source, and thereby cover a wide area.

Interlock monitors are used in applications to prevent inadvertent exposure of workers to an excess dose by preventing personnel access to an area when a high radiation level is present.

Airborne contamination monitors measure the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere to guard against radioactive particles being deposited in the lungs of personnel.
    
Personnel exit monitors are used to monitor workers who are exiting a "contamination controlled" or potentially contaminated area. These can be in the form of hand monitors, clothing frisk probes, or whole body monitors. These monitor the surface of the workers body and clothing to check if any [[radioactive contamination]] has been deposited. These generally measure alpha or beta or gamma, or combinations of these.

The UK [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] has published a good practice guide through its Ionising Radiation Metrology Forum concerning the provision of such equipment and the methodology of calculating the alarm levels to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Operational Monitoring Good Practice Guide "The Selection of Alarm Levels for Personnel Exit Monitors" Dec 2009 - National Physical Laboratory, Teddington UK [http://www.npl.co.uk/upload/pdf/alarm_levels_personnel_exit_monitors.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portable instruments===
Portable instruments are hand-held or transportable.
The hand-held instrument is generally used as a [[survey meter]] to check an object or person in detail, or assess an area where no installed instrumentation exists. They can also be used for personnel exit monitoring or personnel contamination checks in the field. These generally measure alpha, beta or gamma, or combinations of these.

Transportable instruments are generally instruments that would have been permanently installed, but are temporarily placed in an area to provide continuous monitoring where it is likely there will be a hazard. Such instruments are often installed on trolleys to allow easy deployment, and are associated with temporary operational situations.

===Instrument types===
A number of commonly used detection instruments are listed below.

*[[ionization chamber]]s
*[[proportional counter]]s
*[[Geiger counter]]s
*[[Semiconductor detector]]s
*[[Scintillation counter|Scintillation detectors]]

The links should be followed for a fuller description of each.

===Guidance on use===
In the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] has issued a user guidance note on selecting the correct radiation measurement instrument for the application concerned [http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/irp7.pdf]. This covers all ionising radiation instrument technologies, and is a useful comparative guide.

===Radiation dosimeters===
[[Dosimeter]]s are devices worn by the user which measure the [[equivalent dose|radiation dose]] that the user is receiving.
Common types of wearable dosimeters for ionizing radiation include:
* [[Quartz fiber dosimeter]]
* [[Film badge dosimeter]]
* [[Thermoluminescent dosimeter]]
* Solid state ([[MOSFET]] or silicon diode) dosimeter

==Units of measure==
[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External dose quantities used in radiation protection and dosimetry]]
[[File:SI Radiation dose units.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationship of SI radiation dose units]]

===Absorbed dose===

The fundamental units do not take into account the amount of damage done to matter (especially living tissue) by ionizing radiation. This is more closely related to the amount of [[energy]] deposited rather than the charge. This is called the [[absorbed dose]].
*The [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy), with units J/kg, is the [[Systeme International|SI]] unit of absorbed dose, which represents the amount of radiation required to deposit 1 [[joule]] of energy in 1 kilogram of any kind of matter.
*The [[rad (unit)|rad]] (radiation absorbed dose), is the corresponding traditional unit, which is 0.01&amp;nbsp;J deposited per kg.  100 rad = 1 Gy.

===Equivalent dose===

Equal doses of different types or energies of radiation cause different amounts of damage to living tissue. For example, 1&amp;nbsp;Gy of [[alpha radiation]] causes about 20 times as much damage as 1&amp;nbsp;Gy of [[X-ray]]s. Therefore, the [[equivalent dose]] was defined to give an approximate measure of the biological effect of radiation. It is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose by a weighting factor W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, which is different for each type of radiation (see table at [[Relative biological effectiveness#Standardization]]). This weighting factor is also called the Q (quality factor), or RBE ([[relative biological effectiveness]] of the radiation).
*The [[sievert]] (Sv) is the SI unit of equivalent dose. Although it has the same units as the gray, J/kg, it measures something different. For a given type and dose of radiation(s) applied to a certain body part(s) of a certain organism, it measures the magnitude of an X-rays or [[gamma radiation]] dose applied to the whole body of the organism, such that the probabilities of the two scenarios to induce cancer is the same according to current statistics.
*The [[Röntgen equivalent man|rem]] (Roentgen equivalent man) is the traditional unit of equivalent dose. 1 sievert = 100 rem. Because the rem is a relatively large unit, typical equivalent dose is measured in millirem (mrem), 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; rem, or in microsievert (μSv), 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Sv. 1 mrem = 10 μSv.
*A unit sometimes used for low-level doses of radiation is the BRET ([[Background Radiation Equivalent Time]]). This is the number of days of an average person's [[background radiation]] exposure the dose is equivalent to. This unit is not standardized, and depends on the value used for the average background radiation dose. Using the 2000 [[UNSCEAR]] value (below), one BRET unit is equal to about 6.6&amp;nbsp;μSv.

For comparison, the average 'background' dose of natural radiation received by a person per day, based on 2000 UNSCEAR estimate, makes BRET 6.6 μSv (660 μrem). However local exposures vary, with the yearly average in the US being around 3.6 mSv (360 mrem),&lt;ref&gt;Radioactivity in Nature &lt;http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/natural.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and in a small area in India as high as 30&amp;nbsp;mSv (3 rem).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/rp/factsheets/factsheets-htm/fs10bkvsman.htm "Background Radiation: Natural versus Man-Made"] Washington Stet Department of Health&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/seta/2009/01/01/stories/2009010150131600.htm "Monazite sand does not cause excess cancer incidence "], ''The Hindu''&lt;/ref&gt;  The lethal full-body dose of radiation for a human is around 4–5&amp;nbsp;Sv (400–500 rem).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/lethal-dose-ld.html "Lethal dose"], NRC Glossary (August 2, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1898, The Röntgen Society (Currently the [[British Institute of Radiology]]) established a committee on X-ray injuries, thus initiating the discipline of radiation protection.&lt;ref&gt;Mould R. ''A Century of X-rays and Radioactivity in Medicine''. Bristol: IOP Publishing, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The term "health physics" ===
According to Paul Frame:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q2561.html Origin of "health physics"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023503/http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q2561.html |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The term Health Physics is believed to have originated in the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1942, but the exact origin is unknown. The term was possibly coined by [[Robert Spencer Stone|Robert Stone]] or [[Arthur Compton]], since Stone was the head of the Health Division and Arthur Compton was the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory.  The first task of the Health Physics Section was to design shielding for [[atomic reactor|reactor]] [[Chicago Pile-1|CP-1]] that [[Enrico Fermi]] was constructing, so the original HPs were mostly [[physicists]] trying to solve health-related problems. The explanation given by Robert Stone was that '...the term Health Physics has been used on the Plutonium Project to define that field in which physical methods are used to determine the existence of hazards to the health of personnel.'

A variation was given by Raymond Finkle, a Health Division employee during this time frame. 'The coinage at first merely denoted the physics section of the Health Division... the name also served security: '[[radiation protection]]' might arouse unwelcome interest; 'health physics' conveyed nothing.'"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Dietary habits in Hindu scriptures ==
===Vedas===
The earliest Hindu scriptures belong or refer to the [[Vedic period]] which lasted until about 500 BCE according to the chronological division by modern historians. In the [[historical Vedic religion]] of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/2001/08/14/stories/13140833.htm |title=Beef eating: strangulating history  |website=thehindu.com |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later texts===

Several highly authoritative scriptures also bar violence against domestic animals except in the case of ritual sacrifice. This view is clearly expressed in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (3.199.11-12;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199 is 3.207 according to another count.&lt;/ref&gt; 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17), the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (11.5.13-14), and the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (8.15.1). For instance, many Hindus point to the ''[[Mahabharata]]''{{'}}s maxim that "Nonviolence is the highest duty and the highest teaching,"&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.116.37-41&lt;/ref&gt; as advocating a vegetarian diet. It is also reflected in the ''[[Manu Smriti]]'' (5.27-44), a particularly renowned traditional Hindu law book ([[Dharmaśāstra]]). These texts strongly condemn the slaughter of animals and meat eating.

===Sutas===
[[Baudhayana]]

==Early Brahmins of South India==
Some of the south Indian Brahmins during the ''sutra'' period, like those of North India were not meat eaters.&lt;ref name="tamil"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Tamils: from the earliest times to 600 A.D.|last=Iyengar|first=P. T.

==Buddhism and Jainism==
Starting from the last few centuries B.C., [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] contributed much to the belief that [[nonviolence]] is supremely valued which stimulated growing hostility to the slaughter of live animals.

== Practitioners' views on Brahmin vegetarianism ==
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://myvoice.opindia.com/2017/05/food-never-offended-anyone-correcting-the-discourse-on-brahmin-vegetarianism/|title=Food never offended anyone – Correcting the discourse on Brahmin vegetarianism|date=2017-05-05|work=My Voice on OpIndia|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/samulasrimadandh015268mbp|title=Samula Srimadandhra Rigveda Samhita Vol : 1 Parts 1&amp;2|last=Venkata Narasimha Sastry|first=N.|last2=UDL T. T.D.Tirupati|date=1981-01-01|publisher=T.T.D., Tirupati.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Pages 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===The non-influence===

As opposed to the popular views propagated by non-practicing Western and Indian sociologists and [[Indology|Indologists]], the notion of Brahmin vegetarianism is not directly due to the influence of Buddhism or Jainism. Buddhism could not itself influence its followers to adhere to the idea of total [[ahimsa]] as most Buddhists from the times of the Buddha until today are meat eaters. [[Theravada]] Buddhist tradition interprets the last meal of Buddha offered by [[Cunda (Buddhism)|Cunda]] to be pork, to which they attach no stigma or see no violation of the ahimsa principle. [[Buddhist vegetarianism]] is a rare concept even in Buddhist countries like [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]]. Even Buddhism's most famous patron, [[Emperor Ashoka]], did not ban killing of animals and birds in entirety. Rather, [[Ashoka#Animal welfare|Ashoka's animal welfare]] policies only restricted the species of animals that can be killed for food in addition to banning ritual sacrifices of animals on the premise that it is wasteful. Vegetarianism never was a principle to be strictly adhered to in Buddhism and no social stigma was attached to Buddhists who ate meat even in India, the land of its origin. This is reasonably clear from the fact that the austerities of Jainism which includes the strictest form of vegetarianism long pre-dated Buddha's birth and did not apparently influence Buddha's eating habits after his enlightenment. Buddha and Buddhists continued to eat meat so long they were assured that the animal was not killed specifically for the feeding the bhikshus

Vegetarianism is generally true for the [[Pancha-Dravida|pancha-dravida]] brahmins like Iyers, Iyengars, Namboothiris, Telugu Brahmins of all sub-sects, Kannada Brahmins, Maharashtra, Gujarati and Rajasthani Brahmins. It is not as generally true for the [[Pancha-Gauda|pancha-gauda]] brahmins of North and East India. It is well known that the Bengali and Oriya Brahmins are meat eaters. While the Brahmins of the Ganga, Yamuna belt west of Bengal are generally vegetarians, we do see exceptions. Kashmiri Brahmins are said to be meat eaters.

===The greatest influence===

The greatest influence on Brahmin diet has, by far, been the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|yoga sutras]] of [[Patanjali]], which expounded the theory and practice of [[Rāja yoga|Raja Yoga]]. While there have been other schools of yoga, Raja yoga gained greatest prominence as it is suitable for a practitioner to remain a householder and yet transcend the eight stages of yoga ([[Ashtanga vinyasa yoga|ashthanga]] yoga). Although ahimsa, among others, is mentioned as a part of ''yama,'' the first step of ashthanga yoga paddhati, it is generally viewed as an abstinence of mental animosity towards any living creature as one of the means to achieve stillness of mind. The concept of ahimsa has never been taken as an end in itself and certainly not to the level of the moral strictures of the Jains. Killing pests, dangerous animals and enemies of the nation are seen as virtuous acts as opposed to the hands-off philosophy of the Jains. General masses adopt the philosophies of Buddhism, Jainism and Vedanta interchangeably in a culture that integrated the Jain religion and deified Buddha in to the Hindu pantheon.

===Food having gunas (qualities)===

The proliferation of Raja yoga also brought with it the notions of spiritual purity of various kinds of food and their importance in practitioners' life. Various foods are categorized along the lines of the gunas that impact the spiritual progress of the practitioner. Accordingly, food is classified as Sattva, Rajas and Tamas based on the observed impact they have on spiritual progress. '''[[Sattvic diet]]''' is a diet based on foods in [[Ayurveda]] and [[Yoga]] literature that contain [[sattva]] quality ([[guna]]). In this system of dietary classification, foods that harm the mind or body are considered ''Tamasic'', while those that are neither positive or negative are considered ''Rajasic''. Sattvic diet is meant to include food and eating habit that is "pure, essential, natural, vital, energy-containing, clean, conscious, true, honest, wise". Sattvic diet is a regimen that places emphasis on seasonal foods, fruits, dairy products, nuts, seeds, oils, ripe vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and non-meat based proteins. Some Sattvic diet suggestions, such as its relative emphasis on dairy products, is controversial. Sattvic diet is sometimes referred to as yogic diet in modern literature. In ancient and medieval era Yoga literature, the concept discussed is [[Mitahara]], which literally means "moderation in eating".

Since the Brahmins are ordained to follow a lifestyle that ensures the spiritual progress of themselves and that of the society, they have adopted Sattvic diet. [[Kshatriya]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and others who need to be physically and mentally engaged in the worldly affairs are allowed non-Sattvic diet, although they can choose to be vegetarians. For example, [[Vishvamitra|Vishwamitra]], a meat eating Kshatriya, took to austerities as he aspired to become a Brahmarshi, whereas [[Parashurama|Parasurama]], a brahmana, remained actively engaged in his war against the Kshatriyas. 


===Recent research indicating pre-Śramaṇa origins===

While the yogasutras of Patanjali are dated somewhere between 500 B.C. to 400 C.E., Patanjali was not the founder of the yogic school of philosophy. Rather, Patanjali drew upon the vedantic literature Like the [[Upanishads]] and [[Samkhya]] philosophy both of which have Vedic roots. The influence of Samkhya on yogasutras is so great that some scholars preferred not to distinguish yoga as separate from Samkhya, rather presented it as another form of Samkhya. More recent scholarship establishes the origins of Samkhya in the vicinity of 1500 B.C. noting its influence on Buddhist and Yoga schools of Indian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/827703796|title=A course in Indian philosophy|last=Kennedy.|first=Warder, Anthony|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=9788120812444|oclc=827703796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/821012735|title=Classical Sāmkhya and Yoga : an Indian metaphysics of experience|last=Mikel.|first=Burley,|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415648875|oclc=821012735}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/sankhya/|title=Sankhya {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Hoople''' is a hoop-shaped mobility aid used by some [[blindness|blind]] and [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] people, and was designed to help them navigate their way over rough terrain or in a rural environment. It performs a similar role to a [[white cane]], but is designed for use in conditions where using a white cane can be difficult, for example, in snow or on sand. It can also be used by young children as a pre-cane aid or by people with arthritis and other medical conditions which would make the use of a traditional cane difficult. The Hoople is designed to detect obstructions, much like cat's whiskers, through both tactile and audio feedback. Because the Hoople is moved along the ground rather than being moved from side to side like a cane the user can also detect drops two paces ahead, narrow gaps or similar potential obstructions on either side of the path ahead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rnc.ac.uk/products-services/hoople-mobility-aid&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoople was invented in the early 1990s by Clive Ellis and [[Tony Larkin]], two lecturers at the [[Royal National College for the Blind]] in [[Hereford]], [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= New Beacon, September 1991|first= Ann|last= Lee|publisher= RNIB publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hoople is made to order with 5 different sizes available.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rnc.ac.uk/products-services/hoople-mobility-aid&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''immune-mediated inflammatory disease''' ('''IMID''') is any of a group of conditions or diseases that lack a definitive [[etiology]], but which are characterized by common inflammatory pathways leading to [[inflammation]], and which may result from, or be triggered by, a [[dysregulation]] of the normal [[immune response]].  All IMIDs can cause [[end organ damage]], and are associated with increased [[morbidity]] and/or [[death|mortality]].

Inflammation is an important and growing area of [[biomedical]] research and [[health care]] because inflammation mediates and is the primary driver of many medical disorders and [[autoimmune diseases]], including [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[psoriasis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[Behcet's disease]], [[arthritis]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (IBD), and [[allergy]], as well as many [[cardiovascular]], [[neuromuscular]], and [[infectious disease]]s.  Some current research even suggests that [[aging]] is a consequence, in part, of inflammatory processes.

==Characterization==

IMID is characterized by [[immune disregulation]], and one underlying manifestation of this immune disregulation is the inappropriate activation of inflammatory [[cytokines]], such as [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] or [[TNF alpha]], whose actions lead to [[pathological]] consequences.

'''Inspiration porn''' is the portrayal of people who experience disability as inspirational solely or in part on the basis of their disability.&lt;ref name="ted"&gt;{{cite web|first=Stella |last=Young |authorlink=Stella Young |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/stella_young_i_m_not_your_inspiration_thank_you_very_much?language=en |title=Stella Young: I’m not your inspiration, thank you very much &amp;#124; TED Talk |publisher=TED.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2015/02/02/inspiration_porn_is_not_okay_disability_activists_are_not_impressed_with_feel_good_super_bowl_ads/ | title="Inspiration porn is not okay": Disability activists are not impressed with feel-good Super Bowl ads | website=Salon.com | date=2 February 2015 | accessdate=19 August 2015 | author=Heideman, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in 2012 by [[disability rights]] activist [[Stella Young]] in an editorial in [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[Online magazine|webzine]] ''Ramp Up''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Stella |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-03/young-inspiration-porn/4107006 |title=We're not here for your inspiration - The Drum (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further explored in her TEDx Talk.&lt;ref name="ted"/&gt;  She rejected the idea that disabled people's otherwise ordinary activities should be considered extraordinary solely because of disability.

Criticisms of inspiration porn include that it [[Other_(philosophy)|'others']] people who experience disability, that it portrays disability as a burden (as opposed to focusing on the [[Social model of disability|societal obstacles]] that people who experience disability face), and that reducing people who experience disability to inspirations dehumanizes them. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|last1=Rakowitz|first1=Rebecca|title=Inspiration porn: A look at the objectification of the disabled community {{!}} The Crimson White|url=http://www.cw.ua.edu/article/2016/12/inspiration-porn-a-look-at-the-objectification-of-the-disabled-community|website=The Crimson White|publisher=University of Alabama|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Kate|title=On Inspiration Porn|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/on-inspiration-porn_us_596cedd0e4b05561da5a595e|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 TV show ''[[Speechless (TV series)|Speechless]]'' explored the concept in an episode where it explains inspiration porn as "[the] portrayal of people with disabilities as one dimensional; saying to only exist to warm the hearts and open the minds of able-bodied people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/speechless-disability-porn_us_5877ddf6e4b0e58057fdc342 |title=‘Speechless’ Just Schooled Everyone On Disability 'Inspiration Porn' |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=2017-01-16 |accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julio José Frenk Mora''' (born December 20, 1953) is a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[physician]] and former [[secretary of Health of Mexico]]. Frenk is currently the president of the [[University of Miami]].  He is the University of Miami's first Hispanic and native Spanish-speaking president. Frenk formerly served as [[Dean (education)|dean of the faculty]] and T &amp; G Angelopoulos professor of public health and international development at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], from 2009-2015, where he had been the university's first Hispanic and native Spanish-speaking dean.

==Early life and education==
Frenk was born in [[Mexico City, Mexico]], on December 20, 1953. His father and grandfather, a Jew who fled to Mexico from Nazi Germany, were both physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julio Frenk and the University of Miami: Family History|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXR2vhuB1_0|website=YouTube|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HM&gt;{{cite web|title=A Global Health View|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2009/03/global-health-view|publisher=Harvard Magazine|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his medical degree, in 1979, from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] ([[UNAM]]) and went on to obtain three additional advanced degrees: a [[Master of Public Health]] (1981), a [[Master of Arts]] in [[sociology]] (1982), and a joint [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in medical care organization and in sociology (1983), from the [[University of Michigan]].

==Career==
[[File:Frenk Fox Tamez.jpg|thumbnail|left|Secretary Frenk with President Vicente Fox and [[Reyes Tamez]], Secretary of Education, in [[Los Pinos]] during the initialing ceremony of the [[Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica|National Institute of Genomic Medicine]].]]
His professional career began in 1984, when Frenk assumed the position of founding director of the Centre of Public Health Research, Ministry of Health of Mexico, a role he held until 1987. Following that appointment, he went on to serve as the founding director-general of the National Institute of Public Health of Mexico, from 1987 to 1992. From 1995 to 1998, he served as the executive vice president of the Mexican Health Foundation, a private non-profit organization, and the director of its Centre for Health and the Economy. In 1998, he was designated executive director of evidence and information for policy at the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in [[Geneva, Switzerland]].

Following the election of [[Vicente Fox]] in Mexico's 2000 presidential election, Frenk was appointed minister of health of Mexico, a position he held until December 2006.

Following his service as minister of health, Frenk was tapped to serve as senior fellow in the global health program of the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] where he counseled the foundation on global health issues and strategies.

In addition to his many executive positions, Frenk has served in several academic roles including, senior researcher at the National Institute of Public Health and adjunct professor at the faculty of medicine of the National University of Mexico. He was also awarded the position of national researcher. In 1992–1993, he was visiting professor at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies.

He is the author of 28 books and monographs and many articles in academic journals, as well as in cultural magazines and newspapers. He is also a member of the editorial boards of ten international journals and a member of twelve scientific and professional associations, including the [[Mexican Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Medicine of Mexico]] and the [[United States]] [[Institute of Medicine]]. 

In 2003, while serving as minister of health of Mexico, Frenk introduced Seguro Popular, a program of comprehensive national health insurance which expanded access to health care for tens of millions of previously uninsured Mexicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelancetglobalhealthnetwork.com/archives/112 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914043151/http://www.thelancetglobalhealthnetwork.com/archives/112 |archivedate=2008-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One test of any national healthcare delivery program is its durability after the key architects of the plan are no longer in power; Seguro Popular is still operating in late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seguropopular.org/ Seguro Popular website, accessed 11/30/2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Frenk was criticized by tobacco control advocates for cutting an unusual deal with tobacco companies. [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] and British America Tobacco agreed to donate $400 million for health programs in Mexico over 2½ years, but reserved the right to cancel the donation if cigarette taxes were raised&lt;ref&gt;[http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB116164895471701497.html%3Fmod%3Dtodays_us_page_one].&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2005, Frenk met the opposition of [[Interior Secretary]] [[Carlos Abascal]], a conservative [[Catholic]], because of the decision of the Ministry of Health to distribute the [[morning-after pill]] at government health clinics.

Shortly after [[Norberto Rivera Carrera]], the [[archbishop]] of [[Mexico City]], declared that the introduction of the pill should not be made without public debate, Abascal announced debates would be held. However, Frenk denied the existence of any planned reversal of the distribution of the pill. [[Women's rights]] groups applauded the decision, while [[anti-abortion]] activists and the [[Catholic Church]] strongly denounced the pill, as [[abortion|abortive]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In September 2006, the Mexican government put Frenk's name forward as a candidate for the vacant position of director-general of the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juliofrenk2006who.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725040926/http://juliofrenk2006who.org/ |archivedate=2013-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British medical journal [[The Lancet]] published an editorial&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606694968/fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsing Frenk as the best candidate, while [[The Wall Street Journal]] reported that the controversial tobacco deal could hurt his chances for election.&lt;ref&gt;http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB116164895471701497.html%3Fmod%3Dtodays_us_page_one&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO position was awarded to [[Margaret Chan|Dr. Margaret Chan]], in November 2006.

After failing to win the WHO post, Frenk assumed the position of head of the Carso Health Institute, a private, nonprofit center aimed at helping Latin America's poor. {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In July 2010, Frenk joined the board of the Commonwealth Fund.&lt;ref&gt;The Commonwealth Fund (2010). "Dr. Julio Frenk to Join Commonwealth Fund Board of Directors" (http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/News/News-Releases/2010/Jul/Dr-Julio-Frenk.aspx). Commonwealthfund.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julius Fromm''' (4 March 1883 – 12 May 1945) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Germany|German]] entrepreneur, chemist and inventor of a process for making [[condom]]s from liquefied rubber.

==Biography==
Fromm was born  in [[Konin, Poland]], to a [[Jewish]] family, which was part of the [[Russian Empire]] at the time. When he was ten years old his family left for [[Berlin]] in search of a better life there. There, the family made a living by rolling [[cigarette]]s as many Eastern European Jews of Berlin did at the time. Julius's parents died young, so he was forced to take care of himself and his six siblings from the age of fifteen. As mechanization gradually replaced manual production, Fromm started attending evening classes in [[chemistry]].

With [[World War I]], Germany experienced a rapid liberalization of sexual values and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s spread rapidly. During this time, the majority of condoms were still made of "skin": chemically treated intestine or bladder.&lt;ref name="collier134"&gt;{{cite book | first=Aine | last=Collier | year=2007 | title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | publisher=Prometheus Books | location=Amherst, NY | pages=134–135, 157, 219 | isbn=978-1-59102-556-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rubber condoms were also available; they were made by wrapping raw [[rubber]] sheets around molds, then dipping them in a solution to [[Vulcanization|vulcanize]] the rubber.&lt;ref&gt;Collier, p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Fromm invented the ''cement dipping'' method, which made a thinner, seamless condom.&lt;ref name=billy&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubbers haven't always been made of rubber |work=Billy Boy: The excitingly different condom |url=http://www.billy-boy.com/english/info/ |accessdate=2006-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721104435/http://www.billy-boy.com/english/info/ |archivedate=2006-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of working with rubber as a solid material, it was mixed with [[gasoline]] or [[benzene]]. This made it a liquid in which molds could be dipped.&lt;ref name="collier200"&gt;Collier, p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fromm patented his invention in 1916. Mass production started in 1922 and was a great success—''Fromms Act'', as they were called, becoming the first brand-name condoms—which allowed the entrepreneur soon to open up branches in [[Denmark]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Poland]], and the [[Netherlands]]. ''Fromms'' became a synonym for ''condom'' in Germany. In 1920 Fromm was naturalized a German citizen.&lt;ref name=Bbooks&gt;[http://berlinbooks.org/brb/2011/01/the-great-rubber-robbery-how-julius-fromm%E2%80%99s-condom-empire-fell-to-the-nazis/ The Great Rubber Robbery: How Julius Fromm’s Condom Empire Fell to the Nazis]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, the first [[condom machine|condom vending machine]]s were installed by Fromm's company, but the interior ministry only allowed it to advertise the [[hygiene|hygienic]] advantages of condoms, not the condom's use as a [[contraceptive]], because it feared a further decrease of the [[birth rate]].

In 1938, however, under [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]], the government forced Fromm to sell his factories for 116,000 [[Reichsmark]], a fraction of their real value, to Baroness [[Elisabeth von Epenstein]], [[Hermann Göring]]'s godmother. In return Epenstein gave two castles, [[Veldenstein]] and [[Mauterndorf]], to Göring. A year later he emigrated to London, where he died on 12 May 1945. Fromm's estate, which was worth the equivalent of approximately 30 million [[Euro]]s, had already been auctioned off on 17 May 1943 for 2,255 Reichsmark, though many items including a [[grand piano]], plates, and his library had already been bought or stolen before.

Fromms' factory in [[Köpenick]] was almost completely destroyed by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Allied Air raids]], the remaining machinery was shipped to the Soviet Union, as it lay in the [[East Berlin|Soviet sector of Berlin]]. The [[Friedrichshagen]] factory continued to produce condoms, especially for the Red Army. 
The factories would have been returned to Fromm's family according to the [[Potsdam Agreement]], however the company was nationalized by the Communist government, as Julius Fromm was regarded a “Jewish proprietor, capitalist exploiter, anti-social, anti-labour and pro-Nazi”.&lt;ref name=Bbooks/&gt;

In East Germany Fromms condoms were produced by the [[Volkseigener Betrieb]] "Plastina", the brand was renamed to "Mondos".&lt;ref name=Bbooks/&gt;

in West Germany, Julius Fromm's son [[Herbert Fromm]] was forced to pay 174,000 Marks to Otto Metz-Randa for the rights to the name ''Fromm''. Metz-Randa, Elisabeth von Epenstein's lover, had acquired these rights after the death of Göring's godfather, and managed to transform himself from a profiteer of "[[Entjudung]]" (de-jewification) to a victim of the National Socialist regime.&lt;ref name=Bbooks/&gt; Herbert Fromm licensed a [[Bremen]] company to produce ''Fromms'' condoms, which—now called [[Mapa (company)|Mapa]]—produces them to the present day.

'''Lauren B. Alloy''' is a [[professor]] of [[psychology]] at [[Temple University]] and is recognized in the area of [[mood disorder]]s. Her research focuses on cognitive, interpersonal, and biopsychosocial processes in the onset and maintenance of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/007242298x/information_center_view0/about_the_authors.html Abnormal Psychology: About the Authors].&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, Alloy and her longtime collaborator [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson]] demonstrated that depressed individuals held a more accurate view than their non-depressed counterparts in a test which measured [[illusion of control]]. This finding held true even when the depression was manipulated experimentally&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,1015922,00.html Time/CNN: How Full Is That Glass, Really?.]&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[depressive realism]]).

The '''Lazzaretto of Ancona''', also called the '''Mole Vanvitelliana''', is an 18th-century building constructed on an artificial island for the purpose of serving as quarantine station and [[Leprosarium]] for the port town of [[Ancona]], [[Italy]].

The pentagonal building rises on an artificial island in the port which is now connected to the mainland by three bridges. It was a project commissioned by Pope [[Clement XII]], designed by the architect [[Luigi Vanvitelli]], and built (1733−1743). It has originally had no land link to the mainland. A well was located in the central [[Neoclassical Architecture|Neoclassical]] tempietto dedicated to [[Saint Roch]], patron of lepers, in the center of the courtyard. It was built to house possibly infected travellers and goods arriving in the port, as well as lepers.

While the term [[lazaretto]] has been interpreted by some as merely a ''quarantine station for maritime travellers'', for centuries it was the term used to refer to lazar house (Leprosarium or [[Leper colony]]), referring to the one of the two New Testament persons named ''Lazarus'' ({{bibleverse|Luke|16:19-31|NRSV}}).

Over the years, the site has taken different functions, mainly as a military citadel since the 19th century. During World War I, there was a failed attempt to sabotage the Italian naval resources by 60 infiltrating Habsburg sailors. Now it is used as a site of the museum ''Tattile Omero'', as well as home for various exhibitions.

It is not clear why a pentagonal shape was chosen for the building. However, the rationalistic and functional ensemble is common to many works of late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] architecture. The simple but elegant style somehow seeks to redeem the intended, but somewhat sordid purpose; and in this case, enlightened architecture for a less enlightened aim of segregating the elements of the populace that could be viewed as pestilent. The efforts of this work can be compared to the contemporary architecture of institutions meant to provide geometrically compelling structures to house services for the poor in Naples by [[Fernando Fuga]], such as the massive [[Ospedale L'Albergo Reale dei Poveri, Naples|Royal Hospice and Hospital for the Poor]] and the mathematical [[Cemetery of the 366 Fossae, Naples|Cemetery of the 366 Fossae]].

The '''Metastasis Research Society''' (MRS) is an international [[Professional association|professional society]] dedicated to [[metastasis]] research and treatment. Headquartered in [[Tampa, Florida]], the MRS was formed in 1974 as the E.O.R.T.C. Metastasis Club by Bavarian clinical pharmacologist [[Kurt Hellmann]] and Director of the [[Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research]] [[Silvio Garattini]]. It took its current name in the mid-1980s, with its first international meeting as a formal society in 1984 in London.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March-April 2018|title=Kurt Hellman - a rare breed of medical and scientific humanitarian|url=https://www.oncologynews.biz/copy-of-jan-feb-2018|journal=Oncology News|volume=Volume 13, Issue 2|pages=12-14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MRS publishes several journals, including ''Clinical &amp; Experimental Metastasis'', ''Angiogenesis'', and ''Cancer and Metastasis Reviews''. ''Cancer and Metastasis Reviews'', which has an [[impact factor]] of 6.081 in 2018, launched in 1982 to critically review and discuss challenges around cancer studies and therapeutic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/journal/10555|title=Cancer and Metastasis Reviews - Springer|website=link.springer.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Clinical &amp; Experimental Metastasis'' was launched 1983 and has an impact factor of 3.455 as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/journal/10585|title=Clinical &amp; Experimental Metastasis - Springer|website=link.springer.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal covers metastasis research in multiple disciplines that focus on preventing and treating metastasis formation. ''Angiogenesis'' was launched in 1997 as a multidisciplinary rapid disseminator of information about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which angiogenesis is controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/journal/10456|title=Angiogenesis - Springer|website=link.springer.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, it has an impact factor of 4.351. 

The society sponsors a biennial International Metastasis Research Congress where it presents its highest award, the Paget-Ewing Award for excellent research in cancer metastasis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851768151|title=Cancer Metastasis : Molecular and Cellular Biology, Host Immune Responses and Perspective for Treatment|last=Volker.|first=Schirrmacher,|date=1989|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|others=Schwartz-Albiez, R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1643">'''National Matching Services''' ('''NMS''') specializes in the development and administration of Matching Programs. NMS was founded in 1985, after developing sophisticated matching algorithms and software for the placement of [[physician]]s into residencies in the US. Since then, NMS has implemented Matching Programs in a number of industries and professions, including [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]], [[psychology]], [[dentistry]], [[pharmacy]], and [[optometry]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://natmatch.com/ NMS Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; NMS is headquartered in Toronto.

Matching Programs place applicants into positions based on lists of preferred choices submitted by applicants and recruiters. A Matching Program eliminates premature decisions based on incomplete information by allowing all offers, acceptances or rejections to occur at the same time. Therefore many common adverse situations are eliminated from the recruitment process, such as applicants hoarding multiple offers, applicants reneging on a prior acceptance in order to accept a more preferred subsequent offer, and recruiters overfilling the number of positions available. Applicants and recruiters benefit from having full choice of all potential placements. The best strategy for both applicants and recruiters is to submit preference lists that reflect their true preferences.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''NoFap''' is a website and community forum that serves as a [[support group]] for those who wish to avoid [[pornography]] and [[masturbation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cowell|first1=Tom|title=No fapping, please, it's making us ill|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10288240/No-fapping-please-its-making-us-ill.html|accessdate=22 May 2015|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=17 September 2013|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMahon|first1=Tamsin|title=Will quitting porn improve your life?: A growing 'NoFap' movement of young men are saying no to porn and masturbation|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/can-swearing-off-porn-improve-your-life/|accessdate=22 May 2015|work=Maclean's|publisher=Rogers Media|date=20 January 2014|location=Toronto, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name comes from the slang term ''[[wikt:fap#Etymology 2|fap]]'', referring to [[male masturbation]].

==Founding==
NoFap was founded in June 2011 by Alexander Rhodes after a thread on Reddit about a 2003 Chinese study{{#tag:ref | The thread ({{cite web|title=TIL when men don't masturbate for 7 days their testosterone levels increase by 145.7%. • /r/todayilearned|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/i514e/til_when_men_dont_masturbate_for_7_days_their/|website=reddit}}) discussed {{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang M, Xin J, Zou Q, Shen JW | title = A research on the relationship between ejaculation and serum testosterone level in men | journal = J. Zhejiang Univ. Sci. | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 236–240 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12659241 | doi=10.1631/jzus.2003.0236}} | group = "note"}} that found that men who refrain from masturbation for seven days experience a 145.7% spike in [[testosterone]] levels on the seventh day. This hit the front page of a popular forum on Reddit.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jalsevac|first1=John|title=130,000+ Reddit users flock to forum founded by atheist to quit pornography, masturbation|url=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/65000-reddit-users-flock-to-forum-founded-by-atheist-to-quit-pornography-ma|publisher=Life Site|accessdate=10 June 2015 |quote=Rhodes took the initiative and did so, 'in the 23rd hour of June 20, 2011'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aussie" /&gt; Alexander Rhodes appears in the documentary written and directed by Nicholas Tana called ''[[Sticky: A (Self) Love Story]]'', in which he discusses his findings and his opinions about masturbation.&lt;ref name="Fandango"&gt;http://www.fandango.com/movie-trailer/sticky:aselflovestory-trailer/189754&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Rhodes created NoFap as a "subreddit" forum community on Reddit.&lt;ref name="life" /&gt; At first, NoFap ran weekly and monthly challenges for a small group of people on the forum, and then the NoFap administrators created a day counter system. Now forum members set their own challenges based upon their own personal goals.&lt;ref name="life" /&gt; The endeavour is sometimes referred to as ''fapstinence''.&lt;ref&gt;http://gawker.com/5994669/in-defense-of-masturbation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/masturbation-giving-up-effects-life-changes-reddit-nofap-men-say-it-gave-them-superpowers-a7345466.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailypublic.com/articles/05242017/grumpy-ghey-fap-flap&lt;/ref&gt;

===NoFap.com===
Users on NoFap's subreddit more than tripled in number in two years, leading Rhodes to build an off-Reddit forum at NoFap.com and begin other plans to better serve the website's fast-growing factions in Brazil, Germany, and China.&lt;ref name="Eck"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eck|first1=Ian|title=The Men Who Would Not Wank|url=http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-men-who-would-not-wank|publisher=SanFrancisco Magazine|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NoFap.com is a forum-style website where individuals who have committed to abstain from pornography and masturbation for a period of time can talk about their experiences and engage in challenges to help them recover. NoFap.com is the sister website of the Reddit-hosted NoFap community.&lt;ref name="Deseret"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Israelsen-Hartley|first1=Sara|title=Adolescent addiction: When pornography strikes early|url=http://national.deseretnews.com/article/802/Adolescent-addiction-When-pornography-strikes-early.html#dSAGkxAvOUUqlXqB.99|publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After abstaining from porn and masturbation for a period of time, some of NoFap's users claim to experience "dramatic increases in social [[confidence]], [[energy levels|energy]], [[concentration]], mental acuity, motivation, [[self-esteem]], emotional stability, [[happiness]], sexual prowess, and attractiveness to the opposite sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidesify.com/blog/2018/08/25/nofap-quit-fapping/|title=NoFap - Singapore Master Guide to Stop/Quit Fapping Once and For All!|website=www.guidesify.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="life" /&gt; Some NoFap users say their brains were warped by porn, at the expense of real relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=K.|author2=Jackson, S.|date=2018|title=‘I want that power back’: Discourses of masculinity within an online pornography abstinence forum|url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1363460717740248|journal= Sexualities|volume=Vol 21|issue=4|pages=621-639|doi=10.1177/1363460717740248|accessdate=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weisman|first1=Carrie|title=Has Porn Overwhelmed Our Brains?

"We don't have a unified goal. Some people want to masturbate some people don't want to masturbate - it hosts a wide variety of people with different viewpoints.}}&lt;/ref&gt; NoFap techniques are sometimes cited as an improvement method by members of the [[manosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilton Jr, Donald L.

The [[Reddit]]-based PornFree group is similar to NoFap, focusing on giving up porn rather than masturbation and mainly on overcoming addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/porn-free-men-community-give-up-sex-videos-masturbation-reddit-pornfree-a7713841.html |title=Inside the community of men who have given up porn |last=Hosie |first=Rachel |date=2017-05-03 |website=The Independent |access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical profession ===

The medical consensus is that there is no harm from normal masturbation practices.&lt;ref name="Coon2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coon|first1=Dennis|authorlink1=|last2=Mitterer|first2=John O.|authorlink2=|title=Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior|edition=14|chapter=11.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. "Self-abuse," as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth &amp; Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as "bad" or "wrong." In an age when people are urged to practice "[[safer sex]]," masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sigel2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065–1066|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

The implications were clear: if most people masturbated and did not experience insanity, debility, and early death, then masturbation could not be held accountable to the etiology that had been assigned it.

'''Stiftelsen Norsk Luftambulanse''' ("Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation", '''NLA''') is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[humanitarian organisation]], organised as a non-profit [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]]. It primarily promotes and operates helicopter [[air ambulance]] services. {{As of|2014}}, they operate seven [[Eurocopter EC135]] and one [[Eurocopter EC145|EC145]] helicopters out of seven bases in Norway, based on contracts with the state through the [[Norwegian Air Ambulance]]. In Denmark, they operate three EC135 out of three bases.

The foundation carries out charitable work, including providing additional funding for all helicopter ambulances in Norway to increase their medical equipment. It also funds research within [[emergency medicine]] and operates a service to fly its members home in case of illness. With 706,000, it is the organization in Norway with the most members. Operations are carried out through the subsidiary '''Norsk Luftambulanse AS'''.

Established in 1977 by [[Jens Moe]], operations out of [[Lørenskog Heliport, Ahus|Lørenskog Heliport, Central Hospital]] started the following year. The services [[Stavanger Heliport, University Hospital|out of Stavanger]] commenced in 1981. The state funding started in 1988, after which NLA established the bases at [[Bergen Heliport, Nygårdstangen|Bergen]] and [[Trondheim Heliport, Rosten|Trondheim]]. NLS later won contracts to operate out of [[Arendal Heliport, Hospital|Arendal]], [[Ål Heliport, Medical Center|Ål]], [[Dombås Heliport, Brunshaugen|Dombås]], and [[Førde Heliport, Central Hospital|Førde]].

==History==

===Establishment===
A government commission which published its results in 1977 considered the possibility for a helicopter-based air ambulance service.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 10&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that although there could be benefits with a service, the cost would have to weighed up with other health activities. The commission also commented on that the helicopters would lay hold on a large number of physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel with this work the Drøbak-based Jens Moe started working with plans to establish a helicopter ambulance service. He was inspired by the systems applied in West Germany and Switzerland, run by [[ADAC]] and [[Rega (air rescue)|Rega]]. This model involved manning the helicopter with an [[anesthesiologist]], a [[rescue swimmer]] and a pilot. Since the late 1960s he had been working for an improved ambulance service, which he wanted manned with anesthesiologists or anesthesia nurses.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Norsk Luftambulanse AS was incorporated on 6 November 1977, originally with Moe, Fred Øistein Andersen and Ingvar Vilfladt as shareholders. However, they were in need of funding and decided to establish a foundation which would own the operating company and fund it through charitable donations. They decided to follow the example of the German [[Björn-Steiger-Stiftung]] and name the foundation after a patient who probably would have lived with quicker response times. They identified the nine-year-old Bård Østgaard who drowned in Groruddammen in Oslo in August 1975. The parents were sceptical, but hesitantly agreed to the naming scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 22&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few weeks Moe had organized a 700,000 [[Norwegian krone]] loan from [[Storebrand]]. On 26 November 1977, Bård Østgaards Stiftelse was incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the foundation started fund-raising to run a one-year trial with a helicopter based near Oslo. Moe and Andersen held a meeting with [[Minister of Social Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Social Affairs]] [[Ruth Ryste]]. Although she saw the advantages of the case, she could not support it. A major concern was that the service would be provided in [[Eastern Norway]], the most densely populated part of the country. She stated if such a service was adapted, it should be provided equally throughout the country and the [[Western Norway]] or [[Northern Norway]] would be more natural areas to start, with longer distances and poor infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Andersen: 30"&gt;Andersen: 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead Moe turned to the [[Norwegian Automobile Federation]] (NAF), which in 1975 had attempted to start a similar project in [[Moss]] in cooperation with the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]]' medical services. They cooperated in 1977 and brought an ADAC helicopter to various sites in Eastern Norway. By indicated that each location was a possible candidate for a base, they were able to garnish support from the various local newspapers. However, NAF did not have funds to follow through on the project and pulled out.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 34&lt;/ref&gt; Instead Moe approached LHL, which supported their plans. They bought shares in the operating company and issued a guarantee, in exchange for a seat on the board.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation sent out 850,000 brochures to recruit members. Costing half a million krone, it brought in 3000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 38&lt;/ref&gt; They chartered a Rega helicopter which they toured Eastern Norway. On 11 March{{When|date=January 2015}} they were had a demonstration at [[Holmenkollbakken]], when a group of youth were hit by an avalanche at [[Norefjell]]. The helicopter was immediately dispatched and participated in the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 39&lt;/ref&gt; Erik Berge was hired as managing director and his main task was to recruit members. By the end of 1978, the organization had 13,700 members.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 43&lt;/ref&gt;

To make membership more attractive, NLA cooperated with Rega to provide free flights home for its members under given conditions, using Rega's aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 209&lt;/ref&gt; An operations center was established in Drøbak. It gradually developed more as an advisory call center, focusing on giving members advise either before travel or after incidents had occurred. The base was later moved to Lørenskog and the division was named Global Medical Services (GMS).&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lørenskog and Stavanger===
Norsk Luftambulanse started discussions with [[Akershus County Municipality]], who were positive to the service.
This resulted in Akershus Central Hospital (SiA, today Ahus) being selected as the initial base.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 31&lt;/ref&gt; NLA's first helicopter was a [[MBB Bo 105|Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Bo 105]] which was leased from the manufacturer and named ''Bård 1''.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 29&lt;/ref&gt; To aid funding, it received advertisements.&lt;ref name="Andersen: 30"/&gt; The service was inaugurated on 7 June 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 14&lt;/ref&gt; Although SiA received a heliport, no helipads were built at [[Rikshospitalet]] in [[Oslo]]. Therefore, NLA often had to land at [[Bislett Stadion]] and transfer patients to an ambulance there.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 17&lt;/ref&gt;

NLA did not have an [[air operator's certificate]] to begin with and subcontracted operations to [[Mørefly]].&lt;ref name=a16&gt;Andersen: 16&lt;/ref&gt; They received NOK&amp;nbsp;180,000 per month, In addition came the costs for medical personnel, the base and medical equipment. LHL retracted their support in February 1979, citing poor administration. They subsequently sold their shares in the operating company to the foundation. Also Endre Bolsø, Østgaards' stepfather and chairman of the board, criticized the lack of financial control.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 47&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 May 1979 they therefore switched operator to [[Partnair]]. They proposed moving the base to [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu]] to cut costs, but this was rejected.&lt;ref name=a49&gt;Andersen: 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Social Affairs evaluated the helicopter ambulance service after a year. They carried out 216 missions, of which the commission found that five instances where the air ambulance had been decisive to rescue the person's life and avoid permanent injury. They concluded that the helicopter was profitable for society, but did not find it to be optimal use of limited resources in the health sector. It concluded that a service would only be efficient if located on-site at a hospital with quick scrambling of anesthesiologist, where it was well-coordinated with ground ambulance services and emergency communications, and in densely populated areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 13&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 1980 Bolsø and Østegaard's mother were sufficiently fed up with the situation that they asked that the foundation remove Østgaard's name from its name.&lt;ref name=a49 /&gt; This was followed up and on 17 June 1980 the foundation took its current name.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 50&lt;/ref&gt; The same year NLA received its own air operator's certificate.&lt;ref name=a16 /&gt;

The section initiative to build a base took place at [[Stavanger University Hospital|Rogaland Central Hospital]] in [[Stavanger]].&lt;ref name=a131&gt;Andersen: 131&lt;/ref&gt; As in Akershus there were mixed reactions towards the service. Twenty-three municipalities in three counties gave financial support, as did a series of companies. [[Rogaland County Municipality]] approved the plans, but did not provide funding. The main area of dispute was whether helicopters were cost-efficient, and whether the money would not instead be better utilized in other pre-hospital tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 133&lt;/ref&gt; The project did not receive the support of the Directorate of Health.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 134&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stavanger Heliport, University Hospital|Stavanger Heliport, Central Hospital]] opened on 4 June 1981.&lt;ref name=a131 /&gt;

===State funding===
A government commission looked into the air ambulance organization in 1982. It recommended that the [[county municipality (Norway)|county municipalities]] take responsibility for the services in the same way the funded and operated the conventional ambulance services. However, the [[counties of Norway|counties]] were not necessarily a natural border, so it would require inter-county cooperation. The Ministry of Social Affairs concluded that the counties were not large enough to support such a service and therefore proposed a national organization, where the counties paid part of the cost. The national coordination was placed with the [[National Insurance Service]].&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 15&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Easter]] NLA assigned special preparedness for mountainous areas. This resulted in a series of "Easter bases" equipped for the week. The first was in [[Beitostølen]] in 1982. The following years this base was situated at [[Rjukan]]; [[Dombås]]; [[Fagernes Airport, Leirin]]; and [[Geilo Airport, Dagali]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 139&lt;/ref&gt;

A new government commission investigated the issue in 1986. The background was doubling of both costs and use of fixed-wing and rotor-craft air ambulance use between 1982 and 1985. A major contributor was the lack of physicians in [[Finnmark]]. The commission recommended that eight bases be established. In addition to Lørenskog and Stavanger, new bases would be established in [[Tromsø]], [[Brønnøysund]], [[Trondheim]], [[Ålesund]], [[Bergen]] and [[Dombås]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 16&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was carried through and the new bases became operative as of 1988. Funding was secured by the state, while the county municipalities were responsible for the respective medial personnel. The aviation operations were subcontracted to commercial airlines. The new system was named the State's Air Ambulance.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifteen companies bid to operate the various helicopter contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=15 selskaper vil flyambulanse |last=Helskog |first=Svenn R. |work=[[Aftenposten]] |language=Norwegian |date=6 May 1987 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to keeping its operations in Lørenskog and Stavanger, NLA was awarded the contract for Trondheim, Bergen and Dombås.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 88&lt;/ref&gt; Trondheim was well covered by the 330 Squadron from [[Ørland Main Air Station]], and therefore there been a debate if another helicopter would be cost-efficient. Initial plans called for a base at [[St. Olav's Hospital|Trondheim Regional Hospital]], but instead [[Trondheim Heliport, Rosten]] was placed near [[Tiller, Norway|Tiller]].&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cessna 550 Citation II, Norsk Luftambulanse JP212845.jpg|thumb|left|The foundation's [[Cessna Citation II]]]]
NLA station a helicopter in [[Lesja]] for the National Shooting Competition in 1985. The local communities in northern [[Gudbrandsdalen]] therefore started working to receive their own base. The quickly opted for Dombås, as it was the center of the district.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 135&lt;/ref&gt; With local funding, the state gave permission to open a base from 1 January 1988. A facility was built at the municipal medical center, with Dovre Municipality and Lesja Municipality paying for the construction. However, a more suitable base was needed and a new heliport opened on 8 March 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 137&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bergen it was not possible to establish a helipad at the hospital. Instead [[Bergen Heliport, Nygårdstangen]] was built, close to the city center. From there patients were transported by ambulance to [[Haukeland University Hospital|Haukeland Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 143&lt;/ref&gt; The helicopters would on occasion land on a lot at the hospital, although the physician had to claim [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]] as the site lacked certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ny helikopterbase i det blå |last=Egeland |first=Åsmund |date=29 May 2002 |page=3 |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1986 NLA stationed its reserve helicopter in [[Arendal]]. This proved popular and they continued to have a temporary base their each summer.&lt;ref name="Andersen: 151"&gt;Andersen: 151&lt;/ref&gt; The commission stated that [[Agder]] and [[Telemark]] were well within the catchment areas of Stavanger and Lørenskog. When the national commission decided not to establish a base in Agder, several local agencies started working to establish a permanent base anyway.&lt;ref name="Andersen: 151"/&gt; This also resulted in a local location struggle. [[Vest-Agder County Municipality]] argued that the base should be situated at [[Kristiansand Hospital|Vest-Agder Central Hospital]] in [[Kristiansand]], while [[Aust-Agder County Municipality]] wanted it at [[Arendal Hospital|Aust-Agder Central Hospital]] in [[Arendal]].&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]] approved the [[Arendal Heliport, Hospital]], allowing it to start operations in 1991.&lt;ref name=a153&gt;Andersen: 153&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Norway there had since the 1930s been operated fixed-wing seaplane ambulances.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These were often flowing in a combination of ambulance and charter services.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 169&lt;/ref&gt; In the public procurement process, NLA allied themselves with [[Widerøe]] and Air Express. The latter two would operate the aircraft, while NLA would man them with medical personnel. The consortium won the contracts for [[Tromsø Airport]], [[Alta Airport]] and [[Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen]]. NLA established a Northern Norway operations central at Widerøe's offices at [[Bodø Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 171&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisitions===
Due to a strenuous cooperation with Air Express, NLA decided to establish a fixed-wing division in 1989. This included taking over the two aircraft at Kirkenes and the jet used for international flights at Oslo Airport, Fornebu.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 172&lt;/ref&gt; For this work NLA bought a [[Cessna Citation II]], when they operated between 1989 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Hagby: 237&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LN-OOA 11.jpg|thumb|left|Norsk Luftambulanse operates [[Eurocopter EC 135]] helicopters]]
[[Førde Heliport, Central Hospital]] was established in 1992 and the contract was issued to [[Airlift (airline)|Airlift]]. In 1993 there was a new contract tender, and Airlift won the operations out of Førde, Bergen and Dombås. Within NLA there was a debate as to whether to treat Airlift as a competitor or to cooperate with them.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 178&lt;/ref&gt; A deal was struck and NLA bought 34 percent of the company. Later it bought a further 32 percent, but later sold the shares again.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 179&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 NLA lost the contract to operate fixed-wing aircraft in Kirkenes to Mørefly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mørefly får operatøransvar for luftambulansen |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=29 April 1993 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Easter bases spurred interest amongst locals in the interior valleys of [[Buskerud]], [[Oppdal]] and Telemark to receive a permanent helicopter ambulance service. Political work started in 1992, but the Ministry of Social Affairs did not prioritize it in its 1994 budget.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 166&lt;/ref&gt; However, this resulted in a series of political initiatives from the area and when Parliament voted over the budget, grants had been allocated for [[Ål Heliport]].&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 167&lt;/ref&gt; Operations commenced on 1 September 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 168&lt;/ref&gt; The same year NLA stationed a helicopter in [[Lillehammer]] for the duration of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 174&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Svensk flygambulans97.jpg|thumb|A [[Beechcraft Super King Air]] of [[Svensk Flygambulans]]]]
The tender for operations after 2001 resulted in NLA losing the operating rights for Arendal, Ål and Dombås, while it won back the operations in Bergen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Over én milliard til luftambulanser |last=Bø |first=Trond |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=25 September 2000 |page=5 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the hospital reform which took effect 1 January 2002, the coordinating responsibility for hospitals was allocated to the five [[regional health authority (Norway)|regional health authorities]]. They created the [[Norwegian Air Ambulance|National Air Ambulance Service]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luftambulanse.no/about-national-air-ambulance-services-norway |title=About the National Air Ambulance Services of Norway |publisher=[[Norwegian Air Ambulance]] |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; GMS was moved to [[Ullevål University Hospital]] in [[Oslo]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 212&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006 NLA the results of a new tender were announced. NLA kept its existing bases and was also awarded the contract for Arendal, Ål an Dombås from 2008 to 2014 or 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 122&lt;/ref&gt;

NLA bought the Swedish air ambulance operator SOS Flygambulans from [[SOS Alarm]] in May 2004 and renamed it [[Svensk Flygambulans]].&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 219&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidiary was based at [[Gothenburg City Airport]] and operated three fixed-wing aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 220&lt;/ref&gt; NLA saw it as a strategic move to expand its operations both geographically, as well as making them able to enter the fixed-wing market.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 221&lt;/ref&gt; NLA sold Svensk Flygambulans to [[Scandinavian Air Ambulance]] in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scandinavian Air Ambulance AB köper Svensk Flygambulans |work=Pointlex |language=Swedish |date=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Central Hålogaland]] was the most densely populated district of Norway lacking a helicopter ambulance service. The National Air Ambulance Service therefore issued a tender in 2014 to establish a base at [[Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes]]. The tender was won by NLA, who started operations in May 2015. The base was manned with an EC145.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=– Stort løft for anestesiologi|work=Dagens Medisin |language=Norwegian |date=23 October 2014 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denmark introduced a trial with helicopter ambulances in 2011. After the trial period, they announced in October 2013 that NLA had won a six-year contract to operate the new national air ambulance service, with an option to expand the contract to nine years. If executed, the contract is worth one billion [[Danish krone]]. The contract was made with [[Regions Denmark]], a cooperation between the five [[regions of Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dagensmedisin.no/nyheter/skal-levere-redningstjenester-i-danmark-for-en-milliard-/ |title=Skal levere redningstjenester i Danmark for én milliard |work=[[Dagens Medisin]] |last=Storvik |first=Anne Grete |date=31 October 2013 |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.beredskabsinfo.dk/indland/nye-akutlaegehelikoptere-bliver-indviet-paa-tirsdag/ |title=Nye akutlægehelikoptere bliver indviet på tirsdag |publisher=Beredskapsinfo |language=Danish |date=24 September 2014 |last=Toft |first=Frank |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
[[File:LN-OOM2.jpg|thumb|NLA's [[Eurocopter EC145]] at [[Tønsberg Hospital]]]]
Stiftelsen Norsk Luftambulanse is a non-profit foundation based in Drøbak. It has 706,000 members, making it the largest organization in Norway by number of members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norskluftambulanse.no/om-nla/kort-fortal/stiftelsen/ |title=Stiftelsen Norsk Luftambulanse|publisher=Norsk Luftambulanse |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation provides funding for all heliports, independent of operator, to be equipped with a [[ambulance emergency response vehicle]] with similar equipment to that which is installed in the helicopters. The vehicles are used when the anesthesiologists are needed at accidents near the heliport, in which road transport is faster or more convenient than the helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 112&lt;/ref&gt; Donations are used to support research within emergency medicine. NLA has at any time twenty people working on [[doctoral dissertation]]s in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norskluftambulanse.no/forskning/ |title=Størst i Europa på akuttmedisinsk forskning |publisher=Norsk Luftambulanse |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the foundation are entitled advise from NLA's Global Medical Services, situated at Ullevål University Hospital. The center can be used both for advice before travel and after sickness or accidents have occurred. Granted that the member has valid [[travel insurance]], NLA may under given circumstances dispatch a nurse to aid the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norskluftambulanse.no/medlemsfordeler/ |title=Medlemsfordeler |publisher=Norsk Luftambulanse |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NLA provides free [[first-aid]] courses for its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norskluftambulanse.no/kursene/forstehjelpskurs-2/ |title=Førstehjelpskurs |publisher=Norsk Luftambulanse |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also publishes a quarterly membership magazine, ''Magasin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norskluftambulanse.no/magasin/ |title=Magasin |publisher=Norsk Luftambulanse |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norsk Luftambulanse AS is a limited company wholly owned by the foundation that operate ambulance helicopters for the National Air Ambulance Service. It operates ten helicopters, consisting of eleven [[Eurocopter EC135|Eurocopter EC135P2+]] and two [[Eurocopter EC145|Eurocopter EC145 T2]]. These operate out of eight bases in Norway and three in Denmark. The company had a revenue of NOK&amp;nbsp;216 million in 2009 and had 100 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norskluftambulanse.no/om-nla/kort-fortal/nla-as/ |title=Norsk Luftambulanse AS|publisher=Norsk Luftambulanse |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pathfinder network''' is a [[psychometric]] scaling method based on [[graph theory]] and used in the study of expertise, [[knowledge acquisition]], [[knowledge engineering]], scientific [[citation]] patterns, [[information retrieval]], and [[data visualization]]. Pathfinder networks are potentially applicable to any problem addressed by [[network theory]].

==Overview==
Several psychometric scaling methods start from proximity data and yield structures revealing the underlying organization of the data. [[Data clustering]] and [[multidimensional scaling]] are two such methods. Network scaling represents another method based on [[graph theory]]. Pathfinder networks are derived from proximities for pairs of entities.

Proximities can be obtained from similarities, correlations, distances, conditional probabilities, or any other measure of the relationships among entities. The entities are often concepts of some sort, but they can be anything with a pattern of relationships.

In the pathfinder network, the entities correspond to the nodes of the generated network, and the links in the network are determined by the patterns of proximities. For example, if the proximities are similarities, links will generally connect nodes of high similarity. The links in the network will be undirected if the proximities are symmetrical for every pair of entities. Symmetrical proximities mean that the order of the entities is not important, so the proximity of ''i'' and ''j'' is the same as the proximity of ''j'' and ''i'' for all pairs ''i,j''. If the proximities are not symmetrical for every pair, the links will be directed.

==Example==
Here is an example of an undirected pathfinder network derived from average similarity ratings of a group of biology graduate students. The students rated the relatedness of all pairs of the terms shown, and the mean rating for each pair was computed. The network shown is the PFnet(2,&amp;nbsp;∞).

[[Image:Bio q2.jpg]]

==Algorithm==
The pathfinder algorithm uses two parameters.
#The ''q'' parameter constrains the number of indirect proximities examined in generating the network. The ''q'' parameter is an integer value between 2 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, inclusive where ''n'' is the number of nodes or items.
#The ''r'' parameter defines the metric used for computing the distance of paths (cf. the [[Minkowski distance]]). The ''r'' parameter is a real number between 1 and ''infinity'', inclusive.

A network generated with particular values of ''q'' and ''r'' is called a PFnet(''q'',&amp;nbsp;''r''). Both of the parameters have the effect of decreasing the number of links in the network as their values are increased. The network with the minimum number of links is obtained when ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 and ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞, i.e., PFnet(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;∞).

With ordinal-scale data (see [[level of measurement]]), the r-parameter should be infinity because the same PFnet would result from any positive [[monotonic transformation]] of the proximity data. Other values of ''r'' require data measured on a ratio scale. The ''q'' parameter can be varied to yield the desired number of links in the network.

Essentially, pathfinder networks preserve the shortest possible paths given the data so links are eliminated when they are not on shortest paths. The PFnet(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;∞) will be the [[minimum spanning tree]] for the links defined by the proximity data if a unique minimum spanning tree exists. In general, the PFnet(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;∞) includes all of the links in any minimum spanning tree.

The term '''plasticulture''' refers to the practice of using [[plastic]] materials in [[agriculture|agricultural]] applications.  

The plastic materials themselves are often and broadly referred to as "ag plastics."  Plasticulture ag plastics include soil [[fumigation]] film, irrigation [[drip tape]]/tubing, nursery pots and [[silage]] bags, but the term is most often used to describe all kinds of plastic plant/soil coverings. Such coverings range from [[plastic mulch]] film, row coverings, high and low tunnels ([[polytunnel]]s), to plastic [[greenhouse]]s.

[[Polyethylene]] (PE) is the plastic film used by the majority of growers because of its affordability, flexibility and easy manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Allingham"&gt;Allingham Yael (1992). [Plastic Sheets for use in Agriculture]. ''United States Patent''.&lt;/ref&gt; It comes in a variety of thicknesses, such as a low density form (LDPE) as well as a linear low density form (LLDPE). These can be modified by addition of certain elements to the plastic that give it properties beneficial to plant growth such as reduced water loss, UV stabilization to cool soil and prevent insects, elimination of [[photosynthetically active radiation]] to prevent weed growth, IR opacity, antidrip/antifog, and fluorescence.&lt;ref name="Allingham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Espí" /&gt;

==Greenhouses and walk-in tunnel covers==
A [[Greenhouse]] is a large structure in which it is possible to stand and work with automated ventilation. [[High tunnel]]s are [[hoop house]]s, manually ventilated by rolling up the sides. Greenhouse and high tunnel films are usually within the parameters of 80-220μm thick and 20m wide, and have a life span between 6–45 months dependant on several factors.&lt;ref name="Espí" /&gt; Monolayer polyethylene films are better suited for less extreme environmental conditions, while multilayer covers made of three layers, one EVA19 layer inserted between two low-density polyethylene layers has been shown to have a better performance under harsh conditions.&lt;ref name="Adam"&gt;Adam A, Kouider S.A., Hamou A, Saiter J.A. (2005). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142941805001054 Studies of polyethylene multi layer films used as greenhouse covers under Saharan climatic conditions] ''Polymer Testing'', 24(7):e834–838.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Small tunnel covers==
Small tunnel covers are about 1m wide and 1m high, and have a thinner polyethylene film than the large tunnel covers, usually below 80μm. Their lifetime is also shorter than that of the larger versions; they usually have a usable life span of 6–8 months. Use of small tunnels is less popular than both the more expensive but durable greenhouses/walk-in tunnels and the cheaper [[plastic mulch]].&lt;ref name="Espí" /&gt;

==Plastic mulch==
[[File:Plastic mulch, nr Merstone, IW, UK.jpg|thumb|Plastic mulch in a field near Merstone, Isle of Wight, UK]]
Mulching is when a thin plastic film is placed over the ground, poking holes at regular intervals for seeds to be planted in, or placing it directly over plants in the beginning stages of growth. The films remain in place for the duration of the [[horticulture|cultivation]] (usually 2–4 months) and usually have a thickness of 12-80μm. The main functions of [[plastic mulch]] are to insulate and maintain a consistent temperature and [[humidity]] of the soil, preventing evaporation of moisture from the soil, minimization of seedtime and harvest, prevent weed growth, and to prevent erosion. Pigmented or colourless films can be used, each with specific advantages and disadvantages over the other.&lt;ref name="Espí" /&gt; 

Black films prevent weed growth, but do not transmit light to heat up the soil; clear films transmit light and heat the soil, but promote weed growth. [[Photosensitive]] films have been developed that are pigmented to prevent weed growth, but still transmit light to heat the soil. These photosensitive films are more costly than either the clear or black polyethylene sheeting.&lt;ref name="Allingham" /&gt; Black plastic mulch controls evaporation from the soil, improves soil water retention. Plastic mulching proved to reduce irrigation requirements in pepper by 14-29% because of elimination of soil evaporation.&lt;ref name="Abu-Awaad"&gt;Abu-Awwad A.M. (1998). [Effect of mulch and irrigation water amounts on soil evaporation and transpiration] ''J. Agron. Crop Sci.'', 18:e55–59.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Flowering time was also reduced in okra when black plastic mulch was used; the plants reached 50% flowering 3–6 days earlier than un-mulched plots. Plant height in okra was significantly increased with black plastic mulch use compared to those grown in bare soil. Evaporation from soil accounts for 25-50% of water used in [[irrigation]], using plastic mulch prevents much of this evaporation and thus reduces the amount of water needed to grow the crop.&lt;ref name="Ramakrishna"&gt;Ramakrishna A. et al (2006). [Effect of mulch on soil temperature, moisture, weed infestation and yield of groundnut in northern Vietnam] ''Field Crops Res.'', 95:e115–125.&lt;/ref&gt; This conservation of water makes plastic mulch favourable for farmers in dry and arid climates where water is a limited resource. As the second most used ag plastic in the world, the volume of plastic mulch used every year is estimated at 700,000t.&lt;ref name="Espí" /&gt;

==Origins and development around the world==
The first use of plastic film in agriculture was to in an effort to make a cheaper version of a glasshouse. In 1948 Professor E.M. Emmert built the first plastic greenhouse, a wooden structure covered with [[cellulose acetate film]]. He later switched this to a more effective polyethylene film. After this introduction of plastic film to agriculture it began being used at a larger scale around the world by the early 1950s to replace paper for mulching vegetables.&lt;ref name="Espí"&gt;Espí E, Salmerón A, Fontecha A, García Y, and Real A.I. (2006). [http://jpf.sagepub.com/content/22/2/85 Plastic Films for Agricultural Applications] ''Journal of Plastic Filming and Sheeting'', 22(85):e85-102.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1999 almost 30 million acres worldwide were covered in plastic mulch. Only a small percentage of this was in the [[United States]] (185 000 acres), the majority of this plastic growth was happening in economically poor areas of the world and previously unproductive desert regions, such as [[Almeria]] in southern Spain.&lt;ref name="Miles"&gt;Miles C, Kolker K, Reed J, Becker J. [http://agsyst.wsu.edu/AlternativeMulchReport05.pdf ''Alternatives to Plastic Mulch for Organic Vegetable Production'']. Washington State University, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The largest concentrations of greenhouses around the world are mainly found in two areas, with 80% throughout the Far East (China, Japan, Korea), and 15% in the [[Mediterranean basin]]. The area of greenhouse cover is still increasing at a fast rate, during the last decade it is estimated that it has been growing by 20% every year. Areas such as the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]] are growing in their use of plastic greenhouses by 15-20% per year, compared to the weak growth in more developed and economically stable areas such as [[Europe]]. [[China]] leads the world’s growth at 30% per year, translating into a volume of plastic film reaching 1,000,000 t/year. In 2006 80% of the area covered by plastic mulch is found in China where it has a growth rate of 25% per year; this is the highest in the world.&lt;ref name="Espí" /&gt;

Since its introduction in the 1950s, plastic film has been designed and developed to increase produce yield, increase produce size and shorten growth time. Developments in plastic film include durability, optical (ultraviolet, visible, near infrared, and middle infrared) properties, and the antidrip or antifog effect. Recent developments in this area include UV-blocking, NIR-blocking, fluorescent, and ultrathermic films.&lt;ref name="Espí" /&gt;

===Large-scale usage in southern Spain===
[[File:NASA photo of plasticulture, Campo de Dalías, Spain.jpg|thumb|300px|The "sea of plastic" covering 20,000&amp;nbsp;ha of the [[Poniente Almeriense|Campo de Dalías]] around [[El Ejido]] and [[Roquetas de Mar]] in southern Spain.]]
The use of plasticulture in agriculture is growing rapidly, perhaps nowhere more visibly than around [[Almería]] in southern [[Spain]]. The eastern approaches to Almería, north of the airport, are densely covered, as is a large area further northeast, surrounding the towns of Campohermoso, Los Pipaces and Los Grillos (close to [[Níjar]]). 

The densest concentration lies about 20&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Almería, where almost the entire [[Poniente Almeriense|Campo de Dalías]], a low-lying [[Cape (geography)|cape]], is now under plastic (an estimated area of 20,000 hectares). Further west, a similar, but smaller, coastal plain around Carchuna, southeast of [[Motril]], is similarly enveloped. The technique is not restricted to the plains; it is also applied to wide terraces on the sides of shallow valleys, as the valley north of Castell de Ferro shows. 

Elsewhere along the [[Costa Tropical]] and the [[Costa del Sol]], particularly between Almería and [[Málaga]], fruit trees growing on terraces in steeper valleys may be covered with vast tents of plastic netting.

===Recycling===
One significant component of plasticulture is the [[waste disposal|disposal]] of used ag plastics.  Technologies exist which allow for many ag plastics to be [[plastic recycling|recycled]] into viable plastic resins for reuse in the plastics manufacturing industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rkoindustries.com/id26.html Plastic mulch film recycling process] Agricultural plastics recycling website, accessed 07.09.08&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[restorative dentistry]], '''precision attachments''' are the functional mechanical parts of the [[removable partial denture]] made of [[plastic]], [[metal]] or a combination of both. They consist of two parts referred as the 'male' part that is fixed to a [[crown (dentistry)|crown]] inside the patient's mouth and a 'female' part which holds the partial denture. 

The patient can insert and remove the partial dentures and the aim of the precision attachment is to give the patient maximum comfort and ease while wearing, inserting or removing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">'''Siphiwe Hlophe''' is the co-founder of [[Swaziland for Positive Living]], an [[NGO]] that provides counselling and education, and seeks to improve the living conditions of people who are affected by or infected with [[HIV]] in the rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.dk/books?id=cAUCzSgaX0oC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=swapol+aids&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xLCAH4xhd-&amp;sig=cfi6N5ZuCfvi7YqHdAk0opEUIGs&amp;hl=da&amp;ei=qi6sTNKUNI7rOc3A_fYG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=swapol%20aids&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation has been described as "[[Swaziland]]'s most innovative and motivated [[HIV/AIDS]] mitigation programme".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportID=71155&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the President of [[Positive Women]],&lt;ref&gt;http://positivewomen.org&lt;/ref&gt; a UK-based charity founded by Kathryn Llewellyn and Stephen Brown

In 1999 Siphiwe Hlophe was working as a manager in a hotel chain when she won a scholarship to study agricultural economics at [[Bradford University]].  A condition of the scholarship was that she took an [[HIV test]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/30/swaziland-international-aid-and-development&lt;/ref&gt; the result of which showed her to be [[HIV-positive]], after which her husband left her,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportID=71155&lt;/ref&gt; and she lost her scholarship. This showed the [[social stigma|stigma]] that is attached to HIV in Swaziland,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/30/swaziland-international-aid-and-development&lt;/ref&gt; and spurred Siphiwe Hlophe on to co-found SWAPOL to help others in similar situations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstatesman.com/200208190005&lt;/ref&gt; Siphiwe was one of the first women to publicly declare her positive HIV status.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportID=79249&lt;/ref&gt; "It [SWAPOL]was forged from the suffering our the founding members. That may be why people respond to what we are doing, and we are getting so many requests to help communities where HIV is rampant. We are not an NGO that works out of a plush office. We are people who know what it means to face discrimination and rejection, but who have the will to live", says Siphiwe Hlophe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportID=71155&lt;/ref&gt;

Siphiwe Hlophe has four children, the eldest 30 years old and the youngest 19.

'''Structural competency''' is a term used in American [[health professional education]] to describe the ability of health care providers and trainees to appreciate how [[symptoms]], clinical problems, [[diseases]] and attitudes toward patients, populations and health systems are influenced by 'upstream' [[social determinants of health]].

The creators of this term Jonathan Metzl and Helena Hansen proposed a 5-point model [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953613003778].
* Recognition of "structures that shape clinical interactions"
* Development of "an extraclinical language of structure"
* Rearticulation of "'cultural' presentations in structural terms"
* Observation and imagination of "structural intervention"
* Development of "structural humility"

The concept of structural competency is framed in the language of [[competency based medical education]] and is proposed as a new iteration of [[Cultural competence in healthcare|cultural competency]] which is a defined competency in American medical, nursing and public health education.

The '''Swedish Work Environment Authority''' ('''SWEA''') ({{lang-sv|Arbetsmiljöverket}}, abbreviated ''AV'') is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Government agencies in Sweden|administrative authority]] sorting under the [[Ministry of Employment (Sweden)|Ministry of Employment]], responsible for issues relating to the working environment and [[Occupational injury|work injury]] statistics. The agency is tasked by the [[Government of Sweden|Government]] with issuing regulations, should spread information and furnish advice on [[occupational safety and health]] (OSH), and the relating labour laws, in particular the [http://www.av.se/inenglish/lawandjustice/workact/ Work Environment Act] ([https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Arbetsmiljolag-19771160_sfs-1977-1160/ AML]). This is primarily done with the [http://www.av.se/inenglish/lawandjustice/provisions/ Work Environment Authority's Statute Book] (AFS), which contains provisions and general recommendations specifying the requirements to be met by the work environment. The agency also publishes other books, brochures, reports and should promote collaboration between parties on the labour market, on issues relating to OSH. Furthermore, the agency has a supervisory role for the compliance of the occupational health legislation, the Working Hours Act ([http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Arbetstidslag-1982673_sfs-1982-673/ SFS 1982:673]) and, in certain aspects, the Tobacco Act ([http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Tobakslag-1993581_sfs-1993-581/?bet=1993:581 SFS 1993:581]) and the Environmental Code ([http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Miljobalk-1998808_sfs-1998-808/ SFS 1998:808]).

'''The MINDS Foundation''', a [[nonprofit]] located in [[India]], uses a [[grassroots]] approach to eliminate [[Social stigma|stigma]] and provide educational, medical, and moral support for patients with [[mental illness]] in rural India. (1) The organization conducts ongoing research and develops curriculum to expand education about mental health and increase the number of trained staff who can support patients suffering from mental illness. MINDS works with a broad team of directors, advisors, field workers and assistants and receives support through a variety of foundations, grants and [[NGO]]s. Since its creation in 2010, MINDS has increased the level of education and treatment with regards to mental illness, overcoming many of the challenges of rural health work in [[India]].

== Approach ==
MINDS uses a three-phase approach for education, treatment and reintegration.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MINDS Foundation systematic change model.png|thumb|three phase system]] --&gt;

'''Phase 1''' focuses on community-wide education held in each village by social workers, MINDS staff and Community Mental Health Workers. After a short 45-minute film explaining the basics of mental illness and the effectiveness of treatment, there are facilitated discussions and Q&amp;A sessions which focus on de-stigmatization of mental illness. Research suggests that lack of health education in rural India contributes to serious misunderstandings, stigma and denial about the existence and causes of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Magnier|first1=Mark|title=India Battles Misconceptions on Mental Illness|journal=Movement for Global Mental Health (Originally published in the LA Times)|date=7/5/2013|url=http://www.globalmentalhealth.org/india-battles-misconceptions-mental-illness}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to current studies, psychologists believe education programs about [[mental illness]] are one of the most effective ways to reduce this [[Social stigma|stigma]] and encourage patients to receive the treatment they need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mann|first1=Caroline|last2=Himelein|first2=Melissa|title=Putting the person back into psychopathology: an intervention to reduce mental illness stigma in the classroom|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-008-0324-2|doi=10.1007/s00127-008-0324-2|volume=43|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|pages=545–551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phase 2''' focuses on effective, free treatment for any mentally ill person who wishes to receive help. MINDS is committed to working in relation with communities and hospitals across [[Gujarat]] and, therefore, provides free daily transport to local hospitals, free consultation with local doctors and free medication. Furthermore, to ease the treatment process, families of patients are welcome to accompany the patients to the hospitals and doctors appointments. According to the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]], 70-90% of all global mentally ill patients who receive treatment partially or completely recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Alliance on Mental Illness|url=http://www.nami.org/template.cfm?section=about_mental_illness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phase 3''' focuses on each patient's [[:wikt:reintegration|reintegration]] into the local community after treatment. With the help of Community Mental Health Workers, patients receive continued medical support and education. Families of patients also benefit from support and education during this transition. The Phase 1 education and de-stigmatization pave the way for this third phase of MINDS work.

== Programs and Research ==
In addition to the three-phase program running in villages across [[Gujarat]], [[India]], MINDS continually develops programs and conducts research to expand programing. Below is a summary of current, developing programing.

'''Community Mental Health Worker (CMHW) Training'''
Community Mental Health Workers (CMHWs) work as [[advisors]] and [[mentors]] in each village where MINDS programming is run. The CMHWs go through extensive training that focuses on identifying [[mental illness]], connecting patients to hospital care, advising and educating families of mentally ill, supporting the phase 3 [[:wikt:reintegration|reintegration]] process and facilitating phase 1 education workshops. The training for CMHWs was developed in partnership with the Nossal Institute for Global Health, adapted from ''An Introduction to Mental Health: Facilitator’s Manual for Training Community Health Workers in India by the Nossal Institute for Global Health &amp; BasicNeeds''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=The Nossal Institute for Global Health &amp; Basic Needs'|title=An Introduction to Mental Health: Facilitator’s Manual for Training Community Health Workers in India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teacher Training'''
Currently MINDS is developing a training program, based on the [[WHO]] advocation of Task-Shifting, which trains teachers at local schools to identify and support mentally ill youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=World Health Organization|title=Task Shifting: Global Recommendations and Guidelines|date=2008|url=http://www.who.int/workforcealliance/knowledge/resources/taskshifting_guidelines/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program follows a four-step model focused on understanding why mental illness is a problem, identifying possible signs of mental illness in students, supporting students through active listening and de-stigmatization of classrooms and referring students to CMHWs for further consolation and screening.

'''Gender Workshops'''
Additionally, MINDS is considering how discussions and education about gender-specific concerns surrounding mental illness and well-being could further deepen the Phase 1 programming.&lt;ref name="Amanda Walker"&gt;{{cite news|title=gender education research intern|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Published Research'''
''Knowledge of and Attitudes Toward Clinical Depression Among Health Providers in Gujarat, India.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai|title=Knowledge of and Attitudes Toward Clinical Depression Among Health Providers in Gujarat, India.|pmid=24976545 | doi=10.1016/j.aogh.2014.04.001|volume=80|year=2014|journal=Ann Glob Health|pages=89–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Perceptions of Traditional Healing for Mental Illness in Rural Gujarat.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai|title= Perceptions of traditional healing for mental illness in rural Gujarat|pmid=24976546|doi=10.1016/j.aogh.2014.04.013|volume=80|year=2014|journal=Ann Glob Health|pages=96–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization and Administration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Team|url=http://www.mindsfoundation.org/our-team/|website=The MINDS Foundation|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
In order to manage field work, project development and research, MINDS has a multi-level organizational system that combines full-time employees with professional volunteers and advisors around the world. The core team, associates and field team manage the non-profit, monitor the three-phase education treatment &amp; reintegration program and organize ongoing research. The Global and Indian [[Board of Directors]], consisting of notable professors and professionals, monitor the progress of MINDS and support the key values of the NGO. Lastly, the Advisors offer professional advice for program development and research.

In addition to the year-round team, board and advisors, MINDS runs a Leadership Development Development Program where interns from across the US partner with members of the core team to receive training and hands-on experience in marketing, publicity, research and program development. The program aims to develop future leaders in the non-profit arena.

For students and professionals looking for [[field research|field experience]], the MINDS Fellowship Program allows volunteers to work in [[Gujarat]] on research and programing projects.

== History ==
The MINDS Foundation was founded as  [[nonprofit]] in August 2010 and is registered in [[Massachusetts]] as an [[NGO]]; additionally it partners with an NGO of the same name located in India, and thus is run through global offices.&lt;ref name="voices.halabol.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M|first1=Anu|title=The MINDS Foundation: Fighting the Mental Illness|journal=Halabol Voices|date=2013-10-10|url=http://voices.halabol.com/2013/10/09/minds-foundation-fighting-mental-illness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently MINDS runs programs in 19 villages in [[Gujarat]] and will expand to other villages in the near future.

In India, there is no official mental health policy and resources are extremely limited, with only 0.3 psychiatrists/100,000 people and just 0.06% of the national health budget going towards mental illness education and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seervai|first1=Shanoor|title=India's Mental Health Challenge|journal=The Wall Street Journal|date=2013-10-21|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/10/21/indias-mental-health-challenge/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, rural areas in India tend to be some of the most neglected: out of 626 districts in India, only 125 have any sort of mental health program in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Christie|title=Reimagining Psychiatry in Rural India|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/09/reimagining-psychiatry-in-rural-india/262214/|website=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the lack of national resources and funding, "mental illness constitutes nearly one sixth of all health-related disorders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Anat|title=Mental Health Services in Rural India: Challenges and Prospects|date=11/10/2011|url=https://www.academia.edu/1191870/Mental_health_services_in_rural_India_challenges_and_prospects}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[Health in India|health resources in India]] are usually funded, provided and accessed through the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ministry of Health and Family Welfare: Government of India|title=National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3): India|journal=NFHS-3|date=2005–2006|volume=1|page=436|url=http://hetv.org/india/nfhs/nfhs3/NFHS-3-IN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners and Sponsors ==
The MINDS Foundation partners with [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] for program advice and review.

'''Unnecessary health care''' ('''overutilization''', '''overuse''', or '''overtreatment''') is [[healthcare]] provided with a higher volume or cost than is appropriate.&lt;ref name="Perfect Storm"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Ezekiel J.

Factors that drive overuse include paying [[healthcare provider]]s more to do more ([[fee-for-service]]), [[defensive medicine]] to protect against [[wikt:litigiousness#Noun|litigiousness]], and insulation from [[price sensitivity]] in instances where the [[consumer]] is not the [[wikt:payer#Noun|payer]]—the [[patient]] receives goods and services but insurance pays for them (whether public insurance, private, or both).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Ezekiel J. Emanuel]] &amp; [[Victor R. Fuchs]]|title=Health Care Overutilization in the United States—Reply|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association| volume=300|issue=19|page=2251|doi=10.1001/jama.2008.605|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such factors leave many actors in the system (doctors, patients, pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers) with inadequate [[incentive]] to restrain [[health care prices]] or overuse.&lt;ref name="Perfect Storm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waste"/&gt; This drives payers, such as [[national health insurance]] systems or the U.S. [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], to focus on [[medical necessity]] as a condition for payment. However, the threshold between necessity and lack thereof can often be [[subjectivity|subjective]].

''Overtreatment'', in the strict sense, may refer to unnecessary medical interventions, including treatment of a self-limited condition (''[[overdiagnosis]]'') or to extensive treatment for a condition that requires only limited treatment.

==Definition==

A forerunner of the term was what [[Jack Wennberg]] called ''[[unwarranted variation]]'',&lt;ref name="MoreIsLess"&gt;{{cite news |title=More is Less |author=Alix Spiegel |newspaper=[[This American Life]] |date=November 10, 2009 |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/391/more-is-less |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105005053/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/391/more-is-less |archivedate=November 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; different rates of treatments based upon where people lived, not clinical rationale. He had discovered that in studies that began in 1967 and were published in the 1970s and the 1980s: "The basic premise - that medicine was driven by science and by physicians capable of making clinical decisions based on well-established fact and theory - was simply incompatible with the data we saw. It was immediately apparent that suppliers were more important in driving demand than had been previously realized."&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. McCue [http://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/mhe/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=46508 Clamping down on variation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218052952/http://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/mhe/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=46508 |date=December 18, 2007 }} - Managed Healthcare Executive, February 01, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, US bioethicist [[Ezekiel J. Emanuel]] and health economist [[Victor R. Fuchs]] defined unnecessary health care as "overutilization," healthcare provided with a higher volume or cost than is appropriate.&lt;ref name="Perfect Storm"/&gt; Recently, economists have sought to understand unnecessary health care in terms of misconsumption rather than [[overconsumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hensher|first=Martin|last2=Tisdell|first2=John|last3=Zimitat|first3=Craig|date=2017-03-01|title="Too much medicine": Insights and explanations from economic theory and research|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617300278|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=176|pages=77–84|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.01.020|pmid=28131024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 two US physicians wrote in an editorial, that unnecessary care was "defined as services which show no demonstrable benefit to patients" and might represent 30% of U.S. medical care.&lt;ref name="MuchAdo"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Reilly BM, Evans AT | title=Much ado about (doing) nothing| journal=[[Ann Intern Med]] | year= 2009 | volume= 150 | issue= 4 | pages= 270–1 | pmc= | pmid=19221379 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-150-4-200902170-00008| citeseerx=10.1.1.688.1277}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; They referred to a 2003 study on regional variations in Medicare spending, which found, "Medicare enrollees in higher-spending regions receive more care than those in lower-spending regions, but do not have better health outcomes or satisfaction with care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12585826 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-138-4-200302180-00007 | volume=138 | issue=4 | title=The implications of regional variations in Medicare spending.

Med. | pages=288–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the American College of Physicians Ethics, Professionalism, and Human Rights Committee suggested that overtreatment can also be understood in contrast to 'parsimonious care', defined as "care that utilizes the most efficient means to effectively diagnose a condition and treat a patient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Snyder L | year = 2012 | title = American College of Physicians Ethics Manual: sixth edition | url = | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 156 | issue = 1 Pt 2| pages = 73–104 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-156-1-201201031-00001 | pmid = 22213573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Berwick, from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and Andrew Hackbarth from the [[RAND Corporation]] defined overtreatment as "subjecting patients to care that, according to sound science and the patients' own preferences, cannot possibly help them — care rooted in outmoded habits, supply-driven behaviors, and ignoring science." They wrote that trying to do something (treatment or testing) for all patients who might need it inevitably entails doing that same thing for some patients who might not need it." In uncertain situations, "some non-beneficial care was the necessary byproduct of optimal clinical decision making."&lt;ref&gt;Berwick DM, Hackbarth AD.

In October 2015, two pediatricians said that considering "overtreatment as an ethical violation" could help see the conflicting incentives of healthcare workers for treatment or nontreatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ralston Shawn L., Schroeder Alan R. | year = 2015 | title = Doing More vs Doing Good: Aligning Our Ethical Principles From the Personal to the Societal | url = http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=2449668 | journal = JAMA Pediatrics | volume = 169 | issue =  12| pages = 1085–6 | doi = 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.2702 | pmid = 26502277 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160420230628/http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2449668 | archivedate = April 20, 2016 | df = mdy-all }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==
In the US, the country which spends the most on healthcare per person globally, overuse is the most important contributor to the high cost.&lt;ref name="Perfect Storm"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported "chronic overuse of medical care" exists in the United States.&lt;ref name="MayDoLittle"&gt;{{cite news |title=Law May Do Little to Help Curb Unnecessary Care |author=Gina Colata |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 29, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/health/30use.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716030707/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/health/30use.html |archivedate=July 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] estimated in 2005 that "between $.30 and $.40 of every dollar spent on healthcare is spent on the costs of poor quality," amounting to" slightly more than a half-trillion dollars a year... wasted on overuse, underuse, misuse, duplication, system failures, unnecessary repetition, poor communication, and inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Building a Better Delivery System: A New Engineering/Health Care Partnership – Bridging the Quality Chasm |last=Lawrence |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-65406-7 |page=99 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11378.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709002402/http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11378.html |archivedate=July 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Physicians' decisions are the [[proximate cause]] of unnecessary care, though the potential incentives and penalties they face can influence their choices.

===Third-party payers and fee-for-service===
{{See also|Fee-for-service}}

When public or private insurance cover expenses and doctors are paid under a [[fee-for-service]] (FFS) model, neither has an [[incentive]] to consider the cost of treatment, a combination that contributes to waste.&lt;ref name="Waste"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=[[Victor R. Fuchs]] | title = Eliminating 'waste' in health care | journal=[[JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association]] | volume = 302 | issue = 22 | pages = 2481–2482 |date=December 2009 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.1821 | pmid = 19996406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fee-for-service is a large incentive for overuse because health care providers (such as doctors and hospitals) receive revenue from the overtreatment.&lt;ref name="Perfect Storm"/&gt;

[[Atul Gawande]] investigated Medicare FFS reimbursements in [[McAllen, Texas]], for a 2009 article in the ''New Yorker''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Texas town's healthcare puzzle |author=Katty Kay |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 7, 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8137085.stm |accessdate=June 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216214634/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8137085.stm |archivedate=February 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=[[Bryant Furlow]] | title = US reimbursement systems encourage fraud and overutilisation | journal=[[The Lancet Oncology]] | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 937–938 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19810157 | doi = 10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70297-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the town of McAllen was the second-most expensive Medicare market, behind [[Miami]].

===Medical malpractice laws and defensive medicine===
{{See also|Medical malpractice}}
To protect themselves from legal prosecution U.S. physicians have an incentive to order clinically unnecessary tests or tests of little potential value.&lt;ref name="Perfect Storm"/&gt; While [[defensive medicine]] is a favored explanation for high medical costs by physicians, Gawande estimated in 2010 it only contributed to 2.4% of the total $2.3&amp;nbsp;trillion of U.S. health care spending in 2008.&lt;ref name="Reflections"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Michelle M.

===Direct-to-consumer advertising===

[[Direct-to-consumer advertising]] can encourage patients to ask for drugs, devices, diagnostics, or procedures.  Sometimes service providers will simply give these treatments or services rather than attempting the potentially more unpleasant task of convincing the patient what they have requested is not needed, or is likely to cause more harm than good.&lt;ref name="Perfect Storm"/&gt;

===Physician predispositions ===

Dartmouth Medical School professor Gilbert Welch argued 2016 that certain predispositions by physicians and the general public may lead to unnecessary health care, including:&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Welch [https://www.acponline.org/sites/default/files/documents/about_acp/chapters/ut/16mtg/welch.pdf Assumptions That Drive Too Much Medical Care] American College of Physicians, n.d., retrieved 9 May 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Less Medicine, More Health |author=Gilbert Welch |year=2016 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0807077580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of a 2018 review evidence of overtreatment overmedicalization, and overdiagnosis in Pediatrics have been use of commercial rehydration solution, antidepressants, and parenteral nutrition; overmedicalization with planned early deliveries, immobilization of ankle injuries, use of hydrolyzed infant formula; and overdiagnosis of hypoxemia among children recovering from bronchiolitis. &lt;ref&gt;2017 Update on Pediatric Medical Overuse.

==Reduction efforts==
[[Utilization management]] (utilization review) has evolved over decades among both public and private payers in an attempt to reduce overuse. In this effort, insurers employ physicians to review the actions of other physicians and detect overuse. Utilization review has a poor reputation among most clinicians as a corrupted system in which utilization reviewers have their own [[perverse incentive]]s (i.e., find ways to deny coverage no matter what) and in some cases are not practicing physicians, lacking real-world clinical insight or wisdom.

The 2010 U.S. health care reform, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], did not contain serious strategies to reduce overuse; "the public has made it clear that it does not want to be told what medical care it can and cannot have."&lt;ref name="MayDoLittle"/&gt; [[Uwe Reinhardt]], a health economist at Princeton, said "the minute you attack overutilization, you will be called a Nazi before the day is out".&lt;ref name="MayDoLittle"/&gt;

Professional societies and other groups have begun to push for policy changes that would encourage clinicians to avoid providing unnecessary care. Most physicians accept that laboratory tests are overused, but "it remains difficult to persuade them to consider the possibility that they, too, might be overutilizing laboratory tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=[[Jamie A. Weydert]], [[Newell D. Nobbs]], [[Ronald Feld]] &amp; [[John D.

In November 2011, the [[ABIM Foundation|American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation]] began the [[Choosing Wisely]] campaign, which aims to raise awareness of overtreatment and change physician behavior by publicizing lists of tests and treatments that are often overused, and which doctors and patients should try to avoid.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Melchert-Dinkel was originally convicted of two counts of [[assisted suicide|assisting suicide]] for encouraging the July 27, 2005 suicide of 36-year-old Mark Drybrough,&lt;ref&gt;[https://billiongraves.com/grave/MARK-SCOTT-DRYBROUGH/9373685 Mark Drybrough page at BillionGraves]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[British people|British]] [[Information technology|IT]] technician, and the April 20, 2008 suicide of 20-year-old Nadia Kajouji, a student at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/rss/more+light+shed+suspect+kajouji+death/1336185/story.html More light shed on suspect in Kajouji death]&lt;/ref&gt; via [[Internet]] [[chat room]]s.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Those convictions were later overturned by the [[Minnesota]] [[Minnesota Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] when it found that part of the state law used to convict him was unconstitutional. On [[Remand (detention)|remand]], Melchert-Dinkel was convicted on one count of assisting suicide, and one count of attempted assisting suicide.

He served 178 days in jail and will be on [[probation]] for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/william-melchert-dinkel-ex-nurse-who-encouraged-suicides-out-of-jail-1.2962770 William Melchert-Dinkel, ex-nurse who encouraged suicides, out of jail]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
William Francis Melchert-Dinkel allegedly met his victims in internet suicide [[chat room]]s, where he posed as a depressed woman in her 20s using aliases such as "Cami D" or "falcongirl". According to his affidavit, Melchert-Dinkel spoke to dozens of people over the course of four or five years, encouraging them to kill themselves (typically by hanging). He said he was successful in at least five instances.&lt;ref name="thestar3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail3"&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/man-tells-police-he-coached-5-people-to-kill-themselves/article4316086/ |title=Man tells police he coached 5 people to kill themselves |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=May 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |location=Toronto |first=Josh |last=Wingrove}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==

In November 2006, Celia Blay, a retired British schoolteacher living in [[Maiden Bradley]], [[Wiltshire]], received word from a teenaged friend in [[South America]] that she had entered a suicide pact with a young nurse. Blay investigated Melchert-Dinkel's "Li Do" identity and discovered that he had previously agreed to earlier suicide pacts. She convinced the girl to break the pact four hours before the planned suicide, saving her life. Throughout the following year, Blay posted warnings about "Li Do" on other chat websites. She also discovered Melchert-Dinkel's "Falcongirl" and "Cami D" identities, and talked to users who entered other pacts in which he arranged to have attempted victims die in front of their webcams. After months of collecting evidence about the then-unidentified Melchert-Dinkel's activities, Blay approached the local police. They opted not to investigate.

In January 2008—around the time Melchert-Dinkel was corresponding with Kajouji—Blay and a friend, Kat Lowe, set up a [[sting operation|sting]] to catch "Cami D" in the act of attempting a suicide pact. It was during this correspondence that Melchert-Dinkel described seeing a man from [[Birmingham]], thought to be Drybrough, hang himself on his webcam. Lowe and Blay gained Melchert-Dinkel's trust and found information that traced him back to his [[IP address]] and residence in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. In a stroke of luck, they also saw Melchert-Dinkel through a webcam feed, posing as "Cami D". Blay submitted an [[affidavit]] on the matter to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], but received no response. However, the [[Saint Paul Police Department]] and the Minnesota Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force agreed to take the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7069144.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 Village sleuth unmasks US internet predator behind suicide ‘pacts’], ''The Times'' of London, 20 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]'' -- "[http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2009-2010/death_online/]", Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 9 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges==
[[File:RiceCountyCourthouse.JPG|right|thumb|Rice County Courthouse]]
Melchert-Dinkel was convicted on March 15, 2011, in a criminal complaint filed in [[Rice County, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="timesonline1"/&gt;  He was charged with advising, encouraging, or assisting Kajouji and Drybrough in taking their own lives using internet correspondence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36739748/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ |title=Nurse charged with aiding suicides via Internet  |publisher=MSNBC |date=April 23, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2010/04/25/2003471413 |title=US man charged with aiding suicides via the Web|publisher=[[Taipei Times]] |date=April 25, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was ordered to not use the Internet while the case was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/us/26brfs-NOINTERNETFO_BRF.html |title=No Internet for Man Charged in Suicides |publisher= The New York Times |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While counseling to commit suicide is illegal, laws in North America and Britain had not previously been successfully used to prosecute anyone for [[promoting suicide]] over the internet.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt;  He was found guilty of aiding a suicide under Minnesota law, which provides penalties for anyone who "intentionally advises, encourages, or assists another in taking the other's own life", punishment can be up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $30,000.&lt;ref name="thestar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ottawacitizen1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2009/02/28/8566841-sun.html |title=More online suicide chat cases sought  |publisher=Cnews |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced on May 4, 2011, to 360 days in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2011/05/04/aiding-suicides-sentence.html |title=Man who aided Ont. teen's suicide gets year in jail |publisher=CBC |accessdate=May 4, 2011 |date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On  July 27, 2012, the Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.  The Minnesota Supreme Court subsequently agreed to review the case.  On March 19, 2014, the supreme court reversed the conviction and remanded.&lt;ref&gt;http://richardclem.com/casesummaries/MelchertDinkel.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The high court held that the Minnesota statute under which Melchert-Dinkel had been convicted was unconstitutional in part.  The court held that merely advising or encouraging suicide was speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and that those prohibitions were unconstitutional.  It went on to hold, however, that speech which actually assisted a suicide was not protected.

Since the trial court made factual findings only with respect to encouraging and advising, the supreme court reversed the conviction.  It remanded, the case, however, for the lower court to determine whether Melchert-Dinkel had actually assisted the suicides within the meaning of the statute.

===Retrial and second conviction===
On October 15, 2014, Rice County District Judge Thomas Neuville sentenced William Melchert-Dinkel to 3 years in prison, but suspended that sentence if Melchert-Dinkel serves 360 days in jail and abides by the terms of his probation for 10 years after his release. A month prior to the sentencing, Judge Neuville found that Melchert-Dinkel "intentionally advised and encouraged" Drybrough and Kajouji to commit suicide, after the case had been remanded by the Minnesota Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/10/15/william-melchert-dinkel_n_5989372.html |title=William Melchert-Dinkel Sentencing: Former Nurse Tried To Assist Canadian's Suicide |publisher=Huffington Post |date= Dec 15, 2014 |accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melchert-Dinkel was convicted of assisting the suicide of Mark Drybough and attempting to assist the suicide of Nadia Kajouji, because she ultimately took her own life by jumping off a bridge into a frozen river, rather than by hanging, as Melchert-Dinkel had allegedly suggested to her online. During his second sentencing hearing, Melchert-Dinkel stated, "I am sorry... for my actions and what I have done. I have repented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/09/09/assisted-suicide-ex-nurse |title=Judge convicts ex-nurse of assisting suicide |publisher=The Associated Press |date= Sep 9, 2014 |accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Melchert-Dinkel reported to jail on October 24, 2014. Even after his release from prison in February 2015, his lawyer has continued to appeal the conviction.&lt;ref name="attorney to continue arguing"&gt;{{cite news |last= Phenow |first= Brad |date= October 8, 2015 |title= Melchert-Dinkel's attorney to continue arguing until his client sees acquittal |url= http://www.southernminn.com/faribault_daily_news/article_b653aa20-4337-5b1a-8107-29b101d48cce.html |newspaper= Faribault Daily News |location= Faribault, Minnesota |access-date= December 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727201857/http://www.southernminn.com/faribault_daily_news/article_b653aa20-4337-5b1a-8107-29b101d48cce.html|archivedate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
