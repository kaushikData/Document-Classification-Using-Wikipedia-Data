'''Adipati Soero Adinegoro''' (1752 – 1833), also spelt '''Adipati Suroadinegoro''', born '''Han Sam Kong''' ({{zh|韓三江}}), and sometimes known as '''Baba Sam''', was a Chinese-Javanese [[Priyayi|nobleman]] and government official, famous during his lifetime for the good governance of his territories.&lt;ref name="Salmon (1991)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=Claudine|title=The Han Family of East Java.

==Family background==

He was born in 1752 to [[Soero Pernollo|Ngabehi Soero Pernollo]] (1720 – 1776), founder of the Muslim branch of the [[Han family of Lasem]], and was as such a grandson of the Chinese-born [[Han Siong Kong]] (1672 – 1743).&lt;ref name="Salmon (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=Claudine|title=La communauté chinoise de Surabaya. Essai d'histoire, des origines à la crise de 1930|journal=Archipel|date=1997|volume=53|issue=1|pages=121–206|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/arch_0044-8613_1997_num_53_1_3396|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Ngabehi Soero Pernollo, served the [[Dutch East India Company]] in various capacities before being appointed ''politiehoofd'', or police head, of [[Besuki]] and [[Situbondo Regency|Panarukan]] in 1764.&lt;ref name="Salmon (1997)" /&gt; One of his sisters married [[Pakunataningrat I]], [[Sultan]] of [[Sumenep Regency|Sumenep]] (reigned 1812 - 1854).&lt;ref name="Salmon (1991)" /&gt; Other prominent members of his family include his younger brother, Raden Soero Adiwikromo; his uncle, [[Han Bwee Kong|Han Bwee Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen]] (1727 – 1778); and his cousins, [[Han Chan Piet|Han Chan Piet, Majoor der Chinezen]] (1759 – 1827), and [[Han Kik Ko|Han Kik Ko, Majoor der Chinezen]] (1766 – 1813).&lt;ref name="Lombard &amp; Salmon (1994)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Han (2001)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon (1997)" /&gt; His family played an important role in the consolidation of Dutch rule and subsequent administration of [[East Java]].&lt;ref name="Salmon (1997)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Margana (2007)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Margana|first1=Sri|title=Java's last frontier : the struggle for hegemony of Blambangan, c. 1763-1813|date=2007|publisher=TANAP|location=Leiden|pages=210–236|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/12547|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government career==

Baba Sam's career in the colonial administration began with his appointment by the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1772 as ''[[Ronggo]]'', or district head, of [[Besuki]] under the [[Javanese names|Javanese name]] of '''Soemodiwirjo'''.&lt;ref name="Lombard &amp; Salmon (1994)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Margana (2007)" /&gt; He obtained this post thanks to the intercession of his powerful uncle, Han Bwee Kong, [[Kapitan Cina|Kapitein der Chinezen]] of [[Surabaya]] and ''pachter'', or leaseholder, of the district of Besuki.&lt;ref name="Lombard &amp; Salmon (1994)" /&gt; In 1776, Baba Sam was promoted to the higher position of [[Temenggong|''Tumanggung'']] of [[Bangil]] with the successive [[Priyayi|noble titles]] of '''Ngabehi Soero Widjojo''' (1776 – 1788) and '''Tumanggung Soero Adinegoro''' (1788 – 1808).&lt;ref name="Han (2001)" /&gt; According to Jacques Julien de Labillardière and Ch. F. Tombe, French travellers during the [[French and British interludes in the Dutch East Indies|Interregnum in Java]] (1806 – 1815), the Tumanggung not only spoke good [[Dutch language|Dutch]], but was also a keen admirer of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and the latter's administrative policies in Europe.&lt;ref name="Salmon (1991)" /&gt;

[[Herman Willem Daendels]], [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] (1808 – 1811) during the Interregnum, paid a visit to the Tumanggung's district of Bangil in 1808.&lt;ref name="Salmon (1991)" /&gt; Impressed by the good governance of the district, Daendels later that same year made the Tumanggung a ''Ridder'', or [[Knighthood|Knight]], in the [[Order of the Union|Order of Holland]], recently founded in 1807 by [[Louis Bonaparte]], [[King of Holland]].&lt;ref name="Han (2001)" /&gt;

A year later, in 1809, Daendels conferred upon the Tumanggung the dignity of ''Adipati'', the highest title in the ''[[priyayi]]'', or Javanese aristocracy.&lt;ref name="Salmon (1997)" /&gt; Adipati Soero Adinegoro was also elevated to the post of [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|Regent]] of [[Malang Regency|Malang]].&lt;ref name="Salmon (1997)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhuang (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhuang|first1=Wubin|title=Chinese Muslims in Indonesia|date=2011|publisher=Select Publishing|location=Singapore|isbn=9814022683|url=https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Muslims-Indonesia-Zhuang-Wubin/dp/9814022683|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the regencies of [[Gresik Regency|Sidayu]] and [[Tuban Regency|Tuban]] were added to his now considerable jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="Salmon (1997)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhuang (2011)" /&gt; Many of his sons also held government appointments in the colonial administration.&lt;ref name="Salmon (1991)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon (1997)" /&gt;

In 1818, however, the Adipati and his sons were suddenly relieved of their government positions.&lt;ref name="Salmon (1991)" /&gt; It was thought that the Dutch government felt threatened by the organised power of the Han family of Lasem, and wanted to reassert control over the [[Eastern Salient of Java]].&lt;ref name="Salmon (1991)" /&gt;

Adipati Soero Adinegoro died in 1833.&lt;ref name="Salmon (1991)" /&gt;

==Descendants==
The Adipati had a total of twenty-six children.&lt;ref name="Salmon (1997)" /&gt; He gave up one of them, [[Priyayi|''Raden'']] Panderman (born in 1778), in adoption to his childless successor and younger brother, Raden Soero Adiwikromo, who was Ronggo of Besuki (1776), Tumanggung of Puger and Bondowoso (1796), and finally Regent of Tegal.&lt;ref name="Han (2001)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon (1997)" /&gt; Raden Panderman eventually succeeded his adoptive father and uncle, with the patronage of [[Han Chan Piet|Majoor Han Chan Piet]], the landlord of Besuki, as Ronggo of Besuki in 1794, Tumanggung of Puger and Besuki in 1804, then as Regent of Puger in 1813, but was demoted along with his other brothers in the purge of 1818.&lt;ref name="Han (2001)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon (1997)" /&gt;

Raden Panderman's issue, however, managed to retain their position in the colonial administration, and continued their family's tradition of public service in East Java.&lt;ref name="Salmon (1991)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Han (2001)" /&gt; The most prominent line descending from Raden Panderman is that of his son, Raden Karaman, later known as ''Kyai Tumanggung'' Soero Adhi Negoro, who was appointed Tumanggung of [[Kendal Regency|Kendal]], then Regent of [[Probolinggo Regency|Probolinggo]] in 1856.&lt;ref name="Han (2001)" /&gt; The latter was succeeded in Kendal by his son, ''Pangeran Ario'' Noto Amiprodjo; grandson, ''Raden Mas Adipati Ario'' Notonegoro; and great-grandson, ''Raden Mas Adipati Ario'' Notohamidjojo, who all served successively as Regents of Kendal.&lt;ref name="Han (2001)" /&gt;

'''Adrienne Asch''' (September 17, 1946 – November 19, 2013) was a [[bioethics]] scholar and the founding director of the [[Center for Ethics at Yeshiva University]] in New York City. She was also the Edward and Robin Milstein Professor of Bioethics at the [[Wurzweiler School of Social Work]] and Professor of Epidemiology and Population Health at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], which are both graduate professional schools at Yeshiva University.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;[[Margalit Fox|Fox, Margalit]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/nyregion/adrienne-asch-bioethicist-and-pioneer-in-disability-studies-dies-at-67.html "Adrienne Asch, Bioethicist and Pioneer in Disability Studies, Dies at 67"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 23, 2013. Accessed February 13, 2014. "When she was a girl, her family moved to New Jersey, then one of the few states that let blind children attend school with their sighted peers. She attended public schools in Ramsey, in Bergen County."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Asch was born in New York City, and became blind at a few weeks old from [[retinopathy of prematurity]]. Asch grew up in [[Ramsey, New Jersey]], where she attended school in the [[Ramsey Public School District]].&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v504/n7480/full/504377a.html Dorothy Roberts, "Adrienne Asch, 1946–2013," ''Nature'' 504(377)(19 December 2013).]&lt;/ref&gt;

She received a bachelor's degree in philosophy from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1969 and a master's degree in social work from [[Columbia University]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialwork.columbia.edu/news-events/mourning-loss-alumna-adrienne-asch-distinguished-disabilities-scholar "Mourning the Loss of Adrienne Asch, Distinguished Disabilities Scholar," ''Columbia University School of Social Work'' (27 November 2013).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223140000/http://socialwork.columbia.edu/news-events/mourning-loss-alumna-adrienne-asch-distinguished-disabilities-scholar |date=February 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before studying for her Ph.D. in [[Social psychology|social psychology]] in Columbia University, which she received in 1992, she worked in the [[New York State Division of Human Rights]] as an investigator of employment discrimination cases.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;  Asch also trained as a family therapist, and earned a certificate from the Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy in 1981.&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;

== Career ==
Before becoming the Director of the Center for Ethics at Yeshiva University, Asch was professor of women’s studies and the Henry R. Luce Professor in biology, ethics and the politics of human reproduction at the [[Boston University]] School of Social Work and [[Wellesley College]] in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Yeshiva University. (2013). Center for Ethics Directors and Staff. [Web page]. http://yu.edu/ethics/directors-staff/&lt;/ref&gt;  Although she supported a woman's right to choose [[abortion]], Asch took a [[disability justice]] approach in her opposition to [[prenatal testing]] and abortion that would stop pregnancies carrying disabled fetuses. She wrote and lectured extensively on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.yu.edu/news/2013/11/19/in-memoriam-adrienne-asch/ "In Memoriam, Adrienne Asch," ''Yeshiva University News'' (19 November 2013).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422134418/http://blogs.yu.edu/news/2013/11/19/in-memoriam-adrienne-asch/ |date=April 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in ''The American Journal of Public Health'' in 1999, Asch discussed the topic of prenatal testing for disabilities:

: "If public health espouses goals of social justice and equality for people with disabilities — as it has worked to improve the status of women, gays and lesbians, and members of racial and ethnic minorities — it should reconsider whether it wishes to continue the technology of prenatal diagnosis. My moral opposition to prenatal testing and selective abortion flows from the conviction that life with disability is worthwhile and the belief that a just society must appreciate and nurture the lives of all people, whatever the endowments they receive in the natural lottery.”&lt;ref&gt;Asch, A. (1999). "Prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion: A challenge to practice and policy," ''American Journal of Public Health'' 89(11), 1649–1657.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asch helped to develop guidelines for [[end-of-life care]] with the [[Hastings Center]], and was a strong voice for the inclusion of people with disabilities in conversations about bioethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehastingscenter.org/News/Detail.aspx?id=6641 "Adrienne Asch Remembered," ''The Hastings Center News''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222065256/http://www.thehastingscenter.org/News/Detail.aspx?id=6641 |date=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asch also worked with [[assistive technology]] designers, advising on how to make devices more suited for academic needs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm14/bm1401/bm140102.htm Marc Maurer, "Adrienne Asch Dies," ''Braille Monitor'' (January 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Asch died at her [[Manhattan]] home in 2013, age 67, from cancer.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

On 2 August 2010 he was appointed as President of the [[Hellenic Statistical Authority]] (ELSTAT).&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110804214843/http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/ESYE/BUCKET/General/Dr_Andreas_Georgiou_CVEN_0.pdf Bio of Georgiou from the Hellenic Statistical Authority site, archived 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2015, he surprisingly resigned from office with immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;sueddeutsche.de 3.

In July 2016, the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Greek Supreme Court]] upheld charges against Georgiou for having harmed the "national interest",&lt;ref&gt;1331/2016 ([http://www.balkaneu.com/supreme-court-refers-andreas-georgiou-felony-charges/ Supreme Court refers Andreas Georgiou with felony charges] (2nd August 2016))&lt;/ref&gt; with a possible sentence of up to 10 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;ft.com: [https://next.ft.com/content/f949ca70-58cd-11e6-9f70-badea1b336d4 Greece to press ahead with criminal trial for ex-statistics chief]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[FAZ.net]] 3 August 2016: [http://www.faz.net/-gqe-8jzn8 Defizit zu hoch? Statistiker verklagen!] (translated: ''deficit too high ? Bring the statistician to trial!'')&lt;/ref&gt;

These charges have been widely criticized as spurious by numerous international statistical bodies and experts who have backed the accuracy and ethics of his work.  As the Financial Times reported,

"The case has sparked outrage from economists and statisticians worldwide who believe Mr. Georgiou has become a scapegoat for Greece's political class." [https://www.ft.com/content/31995e48-6073-11e6-b38c-7b39cbb1138a]

Mr. Georgiou's prosecution has been denounced as a violation of scientific freedom and human rights by the American Statistical Association's Committee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.amstat.org/blogs/steve-pierson/2017/03/29/asa-writes-to-greek-prime-minister-regarding-charges-against-its-former-chief-statistician-dr-andreas-georgiou]&lt;/ref&gt;, the editorial board of The Economist&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21706276-disturbing-prosecution-greeces-chief-statistician-called-account ''Called to account''] (3rd September 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;, and others. 

In June 2018, the [[Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece]] ('Aeropagus') sentenced him to two years on probation.&lt;ref&gt;www.ekathimerini.com: [http://www.ekathimerini.com/229460/article/ekathimerini/news/top-court-upholds-suspended-prison-sentence-for-former-statistician ''Top court upholds suspended prison sentence for former statistician'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaos-isi.org/index.php/latestnews/221-80-former-chief-statisticians-condemn-prosecution-of-andreas-georgiou ''80 Former Chief Statisticians Condemn Prosecution of Andreas Georgiou'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apollo''' ([[Attic Greek|Attic]], [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], and [[Homeric Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}}, ''Apollōn'' ({{small|[[Genitive|GEN]]}} {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλωνος}}) is one of the most important and complex of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian deities]] in [[Ancient Greek religion|classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman religion]] and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress [[Artemis]]. Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the ''[[kouros]]'' (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all gods. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced [[Etruscan mythology]] as ''Apulu''.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, I. 2006. "The Grave and Beyond." ''The Religion of the Etruscans.'' edited by N. de Grummond and E. Simon. Austin: University of Texas Press. p. vii, p. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the patron of [[Delphi]] (''Pythian Apollo''), Apollo was an [[oracular]] god—the prophetic [[deity]] of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]].

Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son [[Asclepius]], yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]].

As an archer who never missed, Apollo carried a golden bow (silver bow, sometimes) and a quiver of golden arrows. As the inventor of archery and taught the same to the people. His arrows could inflict harm by causing sudden deaths or deadly plague.

As the leader of the [[Muse]]s (''Apollon Musegetes'') and director of their choir, Apollo functions as the patron god of music and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music. The [[Cithara]] and the [[lyre]] are also his inventions. The lyre is a common [[Apollo#Attributes and symbols|attribute of Apollo]]. Hymns sung to Apollo were called [[paean]]s.

Apollo favors and delights in the foundation of towns and the establishment of civil constitution. Hence is associated with dominion over [[Colonies in antiquity|colonists]]. Additionally, he is the god of foreigners, the protector of fugitives and refugees.

Apollo is the giver and interpreter of laws. He presides over the divine law and custom along with [[Zeus]], [[Demeter]] and [[Themis]].

As the protector of young, Apollo (''kourotrophos'') is concerned with the health of children. He presides over their education and brings them out of their adolescence. Due to this belief, boys in Ancient Greece, upon reaching their adulthood, cut their hair and dedicated it to Apollo.

He is the patron of herdsmen and protector of herds and flocks. He is believed to cause abundance in the milk produced by cattle, and is also connected with their fertility.

Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil.  He delivered men from the epidemics. Various epithets call him the "averter of evil".

As an agricultural deity, Apollo protects the crops from diseases, especially the rust in corns and grains. He is also the controller and destroyer of pests that infect plants and plant harvests.

In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as ''Apollo Helios'' he became identified among Greeks with [[Helios]], [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[solar deity|god of the sun]].&lt;ref&gt;For the iconography of the Alexander–Helios type, see H. Hoffmann, 1963. "Helios", in ''Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt'' '''2''', pp. 117–23; cf. Yalouris 1980, no. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin texts, however, there was no [[conflation]] of Apollo with [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] among the classical Latin poets until 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fontenrose, "Apollo and Sol in the Latin poets of the first century BC", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''30''' (1939), pp 439–55; "Apollo and the Sun-God in Ovid", ''American Journal of Philology'' '''61''' (1940) pp 429–44; and "Apollo and Sol in the Oaths of Aeneas and Latinus" ''Classical Philology'' '''38'''.2 (April 1943), pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century CE.

Apollo ([[Attic Greek|Attic]], [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], and [[Homeric Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}}, ''Apollōn'' ({{small|[[Genitive|GEN]]}} {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλωνος}}); [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}, ''Apellōn''; [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπείλων}}, ''Apeilōn''; [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἄπλουν}}, ''Aploun''; {{lang-la|Apollō}})

The name ''Apollo''—unlike the related [[List of Mycenaean deities|older name]] ''Paean''—is generally not found in the [[Linear B]] ([[Mycenean Greek]]) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]] form '']pe-rjo-['' (Linear B: ]{{lang|gmy|𐀟𐁊}}-[) on the [[Knossos|KN]] E 842 tablet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S.

The [[etymology]] of the name is uncertain. The spelling {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}} ({{IPA-el|a.pól.lɔːn|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the [[common era]], but the [[Dorians|Doric]] form, ''Apellon'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}), is more archaic, as it is derived from an earlier {{lang|grc|*Ἀπέλjων}}. It probably is a cognate to the Doric month ''Apellaios'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπελλαῖος}}),&lt;ref name="DDD"&gt;{{cite book |last1=van der Toorn |first1=Karel |last2=Becking |first2=Bob |last3=van der Horst |first3=Pieter Willem |title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PHgUAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |year=1999 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-11119-6 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the offerings [[apellaia]] ({{lang|grc|ἀπελλαῖα}}) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival [[apellai]] ({{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}}).&lt;ref&gt;"The young men became grown-up [[kouros|kouroi]], and Apollon was the "megistos kouros" (The Great Kouros) : Jane Ellen Harrison (2010): ''Themis: A study to the Social origins of Greek Religion'' Cambridge University Press. pp. 439–441, {{ISBN|1108009492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Visible Religion. Volume IV–V. Approaches to Iconology.'' Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1985 p. 143 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UesUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=apellaia#v=onepage&amp;q=apellaia]&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to some scholars, the words are derived from the Doric word ''apella'' ({{lang|grc|ἀπέλλα}}), which originally meant "wall," "fence for animals" and later "assembly within the limits of the square."&lt;ref name=Nilsson556&gt;The word usually appears in plural: [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]: {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}} (''apellai''), {{lang|grc|σηκοί}} ("folds"), {{lang|grc|ἐκκλησίαι}} ("assemblies"), {{lang|grc|ἀρχαιρεσίαι}} ("elections"): Nilsson, Vol. I, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doric Greek verb: {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλάζειν}} ("to assemble"), and the festival {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}} (''apellai''), which surely belonged to Apollo. Nilsson, Vol I, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apella]] ({{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλα}}) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta,&lt;ref name=Nilsson556/&gt; corresponding to the ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἐκκλησία}}). [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun ''apellai'' and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] proto-form *''Apal&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;un''.&lt;ref&gt;Beekes, 2009, pp. 115 and 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several instances of [[popular etymology]] are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb {{lang|grc|ἀπόλλυμι}} (''apollymi''), "to destroy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Campbell |url=http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=apollo |title=Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Apollo |publisher=Behind the Name |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus]]'' connects the name with {{lang|grc|ἀπόλυσις}} (''apolysis''), "redemption", with {{lang|grc|ἀπόλουσις}} (''apolousis''), "purification", and with {{lang|grc|ἁπλοῦν}} (''[h]aploun''), "simple",&lt;ref&gt;The {{lang|grc|ἁπλοῦν}} suggestion is repeated by [[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' in the sense of "[[1 (number)|unity]]".&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, {{lang|grc|Ἄπλουν}}, and finally with {{lang|grc|Ἀειβάλλων}} (''aeiballon''), "ever-shooting". [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] connects the name Apollo with the Doric {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλα}} (''apella''), which means "assembly", so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation {{lang|grc|σηκός}} (''sekos''), "fold", in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=184}} In the [[ancient Macedonian language]] {{lang|grc|πέλλα}} (''pella'') means "stone,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1168.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[toponyms]] may be derived from this word: {{lang|grc|Πέλλα}} ([[Pella]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pe/lla|πέλλα|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the capital of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonia]]) and {{lang|grc|Πελλήνη}} (''Pellēnē''/''[[Pallini|Pallene]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson Vol I, p.558&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'', vol. I (C. H. Beck), 1955:555–564.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] form ''[[Apaliunas]]'' (''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''{{lang|hit-Latn|x-ap-pa-li-u-na-aš}}) is attested in the [[Manapa-Tarhunta letter]],&lt;ref&gt;The reading of ''Apaliunas'' and the possible identification with Apollo is due to [[Emil Forrer]] (1931). It was doubted by [[Paul Kretschmer|Kretschmer]], ''Glotta'' XXIV, p. 250. Martin Nilsson (1967), Vol I, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps related to [[Hurrian]] (and certainly the [[List of Etruscan mythological figures|Etruscan]]) ''[[Aplu (deity)|Aplu]]'', a god of plague, in turn likely from [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''Aplu Enlil'' meaning simply "the son of [[Enlil]]", a title that was given to the god [[Nergal]], who was linked to [[Shamash]], Babylonian god of the sun.&lt;ref name="Grummond"&gt;de Grummond, Nancy Thomson (2006) ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend''. (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology); Mackenzie, Donald A. (2005) ''Myths of Babylonia and Assyria'' (Gutenberg)&lt;/ref&gt;
The role of Apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of [[Apollo Smintheus]] ("mouse Apollo") by Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, with the purpose of sending a plague against the Greeks (the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is [[apotropaic]], meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague).

The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] testimony reflects an early form ''{{lang|grc-Latn|*Apeljōn}}'', which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot {{lang|grc|Ἀπείλων}} with Doric {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Angel |first1=John L. |last2=Mellink |first2=Machteld Johanna | title = Troy and the Trojan War: A Symposium Held at Bryn Mawr College, October 1984| year = 1986| publisher = Bryn Mawr Commentaries| isbn = 978-0-929524-59-7| page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the Lydian god ''Qλdãns'' /kʷʎðãns/ may reflect an earlier /kʷalyán-/ before palatalization, syncope, and the pre-Lydian sound change *y ''&gt;'' d.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgQowuFZeLUC&amp;pg=PA338|title=Anatolian Historical Phonology|last=Melchert|first=Harold Craig|date=1994|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=905183697X|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note the labiovelar in place of the labial /p/ found in pre-Doric ''Ἀπέλjων'' and Hittite ''Apaliunas''.

A [[Luwian language|Luwian]] etymology suggested for ''Apaliunas'' makes Apollo "The One of Entrapment", perhaps in the sense of "Hunter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Immerwahr |first1=Sara Anderson |last2=Chapin |first2=Anne Proctor | title = Charis: Essays in Honor of Sara A.

===Greco-Roman epithets===
Apollo's chief [[epithet]] was '''Phoebus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|b|ə|s}} {{respell|FEE|bəs}}; {{lang|grc|Φοῖβος}}, ''Phoibos'' {{IPA-el|pʰó͜i.bos}}), literally "bright".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1582.&lt;/ref&gt; It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollo's role as the god of light. Like other Greek deities, he had a number of others applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in [[Latin literature]].

====Sun====
*'''Aegletes''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|ɡ|l|iː|t|iː|z}} {{respell|ə|GLEE|teez}}; Αἰγλήτης, ''Aiglētēs''), from {{lang|grc|αἴγλη}}, "light of the sun"&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], iv. 1730;'' Pseudo-Apollodorus, [[Bibliotheke|Biblioteca]]'', i. 9. § 26&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Helius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|iː|l|i|ə|s}} {{respell|HEE|lee|əs}}; {{lang|grc|Ἥλιος}}, ''[[Helios]]''), literally "sun"&lt;ref name="simbolismo"&gt;{{cite book| last = Álvaro Jr., Santos| first = Allan| title = Simbolismo divino| url = https://books.google.com/?id=uAiConL3xyYC| publisher = Allan Álvaro, Jr., Santos }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Apollo Lyceus|Lyceus]]''' ({{IPAc-en|l|aɪ|ˈ|s|iː|ə|s}} {{respell|ly|SEE|əs}}; {{lang|grc|Λύκειος}}, ''Lykeios'', from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] *{{lang|grc|λύκη}}) "light". The meaning of the epithet "Lyceus" later became associated with Apollo's mother [[Leto]], who was the patron goddess of [[Lycia]] ({{lang|grc|Λυκία}}) and who was identified with the wolf ({{lang|grc|λύκος}}).&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''On the Nature of Animals'' 4. 4 (A.F. Scholfield, tr.)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Phanaeus''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|n|iː|ə|s}} {{respell|fə|NEE|əs}}; {{lang|grc|Φαναῖος}}, ''Phanaios''), literally "giving or bringing light"
*'''Phoebus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|b|ə|s}} {{respell|FEE|bəs}}; {{lang|grc|Φοῖβος}}, ''Phoibos''), literally "bright", his most commonly used epithet by both the Greeks and Romans
*'''[[Sol (mythology)|Sol]]''' (Roman) ({{IPAc-en|s|ɒ|l}}), "sun" in Latin

====Wolf====
*'''Lycegenes''' ({{IPAc-en|l|aɪ|ˈ|s|ɛ|dʒ|ən|iː|z}} {{respell|ly|SEJ|ən|eez}}; {{lang|grc|Λυκηγενής}}, ''Lukēgenēs''), literally "born of a wolf" or "born of Lycia"
*'''Lycoctonus''' ({{IPAc-en|l|aɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|t|ə|n|ə|s}} {{respell|ly|KOK|tə|nəs}}; {{lang|grc|Λυκοκτόνος}}, ''Lykoktonos''), from {{lang|grc|λύκος}}, "wolf", and {{lang|grc|κτείνειν}}, "to kill"

====Origin and birth====
Apollo's birthplace was [[Cynthus|Mount Cynthus]] on the island of [[Delos]].

==Origins==
[[File:Omphalos museum.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Omphalos]] in the Museum of [[Delphi]]]]
The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, [[Delphi]] and [[Delos]], date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to [[Artemis]], Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of [[Pytho]]. For the Greeks, Apollo was all the Gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods. In [[archaic period in Greece|archaic Greece]] he was the [[prophet]], the oracular god who in older times was connected with "healing". In [[classical period in Greece|classical Greece]] he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967)".Die Geschicte der Giechischen Religion.Vol I".C.F.Beck Verlag.Munchen. p 529&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Burkert]]&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, Walter. ''Greek Religion'', 1985:144.&lt;/ref&gt; discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed "a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component."

From his eastern origin Apollo brought the art of inspection of "symbols and [[omen|omina]]" (σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα : ''sēmeia kai terata''), and of the observation of the [[omen]]s of the days. The inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from [[Anatolia]]. The [[ritual]]ism belonged to Apollo from the beginning. The Greeks created the [[Legalism (Western philosophy)|legalism]], the supervision of the orders of the gods, and the demand for moderation and harmony. Apollo became the god of shining youth, ideal beauty, fine arts, philosophy, moderation, spiritual-life, the protector of music, divine law and perceptible order. The improvement of the old [[Anatolia]]n god, and his elevation to an intellectual sphere, may be considered an achievement of the [[Greek people]].&lt;ref name="Nilsson563"&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|Martin Nilsson]]. ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion Vol I'', pp. 563–564&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healer and god-protector from evil===
The function of Apollo as a "healer" is connected with [[Paean (god)|Paean]] ({{lang|grc|Παιών-Παιήων}}), the physician of the Gods in the ''[[Iliad]]'', who seems to come from a more primitive religion.&lt;ref&gt;Paieon ({{lang|grc|Παιήων}}) puts pain-relieving medicines on the wounds of Pluton and Ares ( [[Ilias]] E401). This art is related with Egypt: ([[Odyssey]] D232): M. Nilsson Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; Paeοn is probably connected with the [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean]] ''pa-ja-wo-ne'' (Linear B: {{lang|gmy|𐀞𐀊𐀺𐀚}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mycenaeans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXwzT1048Z4C&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage|page=160|first=Louise|last=Schofield|year=2007|publisher=The British Museum Press|isbn=978-0-89236-867-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/linear-b-transliterations/knossos/kn-v/kn-v/#toc-kn-v-52|title=KN V 52+|website=Deaditerranean: Minoan Linear A &amp; Mycenaean Linear B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chawick&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=John|author-link=John Chadwick|title=The Mycenaean World|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1976|isbn=0-521-29037-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMj7M_tGaNMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage|page=89}} At Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not certain. He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease. Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song "paean" ({{lang|grc|παιάν}}). The magicians were also called "seer-doctors" ({{lang|grc|ἰατρομάντεις}}), and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Ἐπὶ καταπαύσει λοιμῶν καὶ νόσων ᾄδόμενος}}. ''Which is sung to stop the plagues and the diseases''. Proklos: Chrestom from Photios Bibl. code. 239, p. 321: Martin Nilsson. Die Geschicthe der Griechischen religion. Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Iliad'', Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the [[Vedic]] god of disease [[Rudra]].&lt;ref name="Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 541"&gt;"The conception that the diseases come from invisible shots sent by magicians or supernatural beings is common in primitive people and also in European folklore. In North-Europe they speak of the "[[Elf-shot]]s". In Sweden where the Lapps were called magicians, they speak of the "Lappen-shots". Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; He sends a plague ({{lang|grc|λοιμός}}) to the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]. The god who sends a disease can also prevent it; therefore, when it stops, they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a [[hecatomb]] to ward off evil. When the oath of his priest appeases, they pray and with a song they call their own god, the ''Paean''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilias]] A 314. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common epithets of Apollo as a healer are "paion" ({{lang|grc|παιών}} literally "healer" or "helper")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0062:entry=paean-harpers]: Harper's Dictionary of classical antiquity&lt;/ref&gt; "epikourios" ({{lang|grc|ἐπικούριος}}, "succouring"), "oulios" ({{lang|grc|οὔλιος}}, "healer, baleful")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ou)/lios|οὔλιος|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and "loimios" ({{lang|grc|λοίμιος}}, "of the plague"). In classical times, his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and was therefore called "apotropaios" ({{lang|grc|ἀποτρόπαιος}}, "averting evil") and "alexikakos" ({{lang|grc|ἀλεξίκακος}} "keeping off ill"; from [[verb|v.]] {{lang|grc|ἀλέξω}} + [[noun|n.]] {{lang|grc|κακόν}}).&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias VIII 41, 8-IV 34, 7-Sittig. Nom P. 48. f-Aristoph. Vesp. V. 61-Paus. I 3, 4. Martin Nilsson (1967) Vol I, p. 540, 544&lt;/ref&gt; In later writers, the word, usually spelled "Paean", becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of [[healing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Graf| first = Fritz| title = Apollo| url = https://books.google.com/?id=it9n9_I-UOkC&amp;pg=PA66| year = 2008| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| isbn = 978-0-203-58171-1| page = 66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer illustrated Paeon the god, and the song both of [[apotropaic]] thanksgiving or triumph.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods: to [[Dionysus]], to Apollo [[Helios]], to Apollo's son [[Asclepius]] the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognised as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the [[Python (mythology)|Python]] led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.

===Dorian origin===
[[File:Apollo-WaltersArt.jpg|left|thumb|''Apollo Victorious over the Python'' by the Florentine [[Pietro Francavilla]] (dated 1591) depicting Apollo's first triumph, when he slew with his bow and arrows the serpent Python, which lies dead at his feet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[The Walters Art Museum]]

The connection with the Dorians and their initiation festival ''[[apellai]]'' is reinforced by the month ''Apellaios'' in northwest Greek calendars.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, ''Apollo'', pp. 104–113; Burkert also notes in this context [[Archilochus]] ''Fr.'' 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo ([[Dorians|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert (1985) ''Greek Religion''.

The "[[Homeric hymn]]" represents Apollo as a Northern intruder. His arrival must have occurred during the "[[Greek Dark Ages|Dark Ages]]" that followed the destruction of the [[Mycenaean civilization]], and his conflict with [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Mother Earth) was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent [[Python (mythology)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Park (1956). ''The delphic oracle''. Vol.I, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth deity had power over the ghostly world, and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Farnel(1909)''The cult of the city states. Clarendon Press. VIII. pp. 8–10''&lt;/ref&gt; The older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated. A female dragon named [[Delphyne]] ({{lang|grc|Δελφύνη}}; cf. {{lang|grc|δελφύς}}, "womb"),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|delfu/s|δελφύς|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a male serpent [[Typhon]] ({{lang|grc|Τυφῶν}}; from {{lang|grc|τύφειν}}, "to smoke"), the adversary of [[Zeus]] in the [[Titanomachy]], who the narrators confused with [[Python (mythology)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;"Many pictures show the serpent Python living in amity with Apollo and guarding the Omphalos.

Also in Greek religion, "snake of the house" ({{lang|grc|οἰκουρὸς ὄφις}}) in the temple of [[Athena]] at Acropolis, etc., and in Greek folklore.

Apollo and his sister [[Artemis]] can bring death with their arrows. The conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings, or magicians is common in [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] and [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref name="Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 541"/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]] Artemis was the leader ({{lang|grc|ἡγεμών}}, "hegemon") of the [[nymphs]], who had similar functions with the [[Norse mythology|Nordic]] [[Elf|Elves]].&lt;ref name="Nilsson499"&gt;. Martin Nilsson (1967), Vol I, pp. 499–500&lt;/ref&gt; The "elf-shot" originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves, but it was later attested denoting stone [[arrow (weapon)|arrow]]-heads which were used by witches to harm people, and also for healing rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Alaric. 2005. 'Getting Shot of Elves: Healing, Witchcraft and Fairies in the Scottish Witchcraft Trials', [http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/5597/], 116 (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;19–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedic]] Rudra has some similar functions with Apollo. The terrible god is called "The Archer", and the bow is also an attribute of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;For {{IAST|Śarva}} as a name of Shiva see: Apte, p.&amp;nbsp;910.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them, and his alternative Shiba is a healer physician god.&lt;ref&gt;For association between Rudra and disease, with Rigvedic references, see: Bhandarkar, p.&amp;nbsp;146.&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.

===Minoan origin===
[[File:AMI - Goldene Doppelaxt.jpg|thumb|250px|Ornamented golden [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[labrys]]]]
It seems an oracular cult existed in Delphi from the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] age.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 8.80&lt;/ref&gt; In historical times, the priests of Delphi were called [[labrys|Lab(r)yadai]], "the double-axe men", which indicates [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] origin. The double-axe, [[labrys]], was the holy symbol of the [[Crete|Cretan]] [[labyrinth]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1975). ''Cretan Paewones. Roman and Byzantine studies'', pp.&amp;nbsp;129–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.G.Wunderlich. ''The secret of Creta'' Souvenir Press Ltd. London p.&amp;nbsp;319&lt;/ref&gt; The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. ''Apollo Delphinios'' or ''Delphidios'' was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol&amp;nbsp;I, p.&amp;nbsp;554 A4&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's sister [[Artemis]], who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with [[Britomartis]] ([[Diktynna]]), the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] "Mistress of the animals". In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the "Mister of the animals", a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute. His original name is unknown, but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular Apollo, who stood by the virgin "Mistress of the Animals", becoming her brother.&lt;ref name=Nilsson499/&gt;

The old oracles in Delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood, and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the temple. This led some scholars to the conclusion that Pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries, according to the local tradition. In that regard, the mythical seeress [[Sibyl]] of [[Anatolia]]n origin, with her ecstatic art, looks unrelated to the oracle itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Bowden (2005). ''Classical Athens and the Delphic oracle'', pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves, which seem to be confirmed by recent studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = William J. Broad| title = The oracle: the lost secrets and hidden message of ancient Delphi| year = 2006| publisher = Penguin Group USA| isbn = 1-59420-081-5| page = 32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] describes the priestesses of Delphi and [[Dodona]] as frenzied women, obsessed by "[[mania]]" ({{lang|grc|μανία}}, "frenzy"), a Greek word he connected with ''mantis'' ({{lang|grc|μάντις}}, "prophet").&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ma/ntis|μάντις|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Frenzied women like Sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the [[Near East]] as [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in the second millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert (1985).''The Greek religion''. p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Although Crete had contacts with Mari from 2000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;F.Schachermeyer (1964). p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the Minoan and Mycenean ages. It is more probable that this art was introduced later from [[Anatolia]] and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to Delphi and dormant in several areas of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, pp. 543–545&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatolian origin===
[[File:Coin of Apollo Agyieus.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of a coin of Apollo Agyieus from [[Ambracia]]]]
A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.&lt;ref name="DDD"/&gt; The name of Apollo's mother [[Leto]] has [[Lydia]]n origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of [[Asia Minor]]. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from [[Anatolia]], which is the origin of [[Sibyl]], and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old [[Assyria|Assyro]]-[[Babylon]]ian texts, and these rituals were spread into the empire of the [[Hittites]]. In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain "purification".&lt;ref name=Nilsson563/&gt;

A similar story is mentioned by [[Plutarch]]. He writes that the [[Creta]]n [[prophet|seer]] [[Epimenides]] purified [[Athens]] after the pollution brought by the [[Alcmeonidae]], and that the seer's expertise in [[sacrifice]]s and reform of funeral practices were of great help to [[Solon]] in his reform of the Athenian state.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Solon'', 12; [[Aristotle]], ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Ath. Pol]]''. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The story indicates that Epimenides was probably heir to the [[Shamanism#Asia|shamanic religions of Asia]], and proves, together with the [[Homeric]] hymn, that Crete had a resisting religion up to historical times. It seems that these rituals were dormant in Greece, and they were reinforced when the Greeks migrated to [[Anatolia]].

[[Homer]] pictures Apollo on the side of the [[Troy|Trojans]], fighting against the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], during the [[Trojan War]]. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to ''Appaliunas'', a tutelary god of [[Wilusa]] ([[Troy]]) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kretschmer]] (1936). Glotta XXIV p. 250. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; The stones found in front of the gates of [[Homer]]ic Troy were the symbols of Apollo. A western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of ''Artimus'' ([[Artemis]]) and ''Qλdãns'', whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms, in surviving [[Lydian language|Lydian]] texts''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ediana.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/corpus.php|title=EDIANA - Corpus|website=www.ediana.gwi.uni-muenchen.de|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of ''Qλdãns'' with Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sardisexpedition.org/en/essays/latw-greenewalt-gods-of-lydia|title=The Archaeological Exploration of Sardis|website=sardisexpedition.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks gave to him the name {{lang|grc|ἀγυιεύς}} ''[[agyieus]]'' as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil, and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion.'' vol. I (C. H. Beck), 1955:563f.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the [[full moon]], all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (''sibutu'') indicates a [[Babylonia]]n origin.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Late Bronze Age]] (from 1700 to 1200 BCE) [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] ''Aplu'' was a god of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], invoked during plague years. Here we have an [[apotrope|apotropaic]] situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it. Aplu, meaning ''the son of'', was a title given to the god [[Nergal]], who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun [[Shamash]].&lt;ref name=Grummond /&gt; Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god ({{lang|grc|δεινὸς θεός}}) who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I. pp. 559–560.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Iliad]]'', his priest prays to ''Apollo Smintheus'',&lt;ref&gt;"You Apollo Smintheus, let my tears become your arrows against the Danaans, for revenge". [[Iliad]] 1.33 (A 33).&lt;/ref&gt; the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats.&lt;ref name=LSJsmintheus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An ancient aetiological myth connects ''sminthos'' with mouse and suggests Cretan origin. Apollo is the mouse-god (Strabo 13.1.48).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sminthia" in several areas of Greece. In [[Rhodes]] (Lindos) they belong to Apollo and Dionysos who have destroyed the rats that were swallowing the grapes". Martin Nilsson (1967). pp. 534–535.&lt;/ref&gt; All these functions, including the function of the healer-god [[Paean (god)|Paean]], who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo.

==Oracular cult==
[[File:Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.jpeg|thumb|250px|Columns of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi, Greece]]
Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: [[Delos]] and [[Delphi]]. In cult practice, [[Delos|Delian Apollo]] and [[Pythian Apollo]] (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985:143.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's [[Cult (religion)|cult]] was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]], and the frequency of [[theophoric names]] such as ''Apollodorus'' or ''Apollonios'' and cities named ''Apollonia'' testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at [[Didyma]] and [[Clarus]] pronounced the so-called "theological oracles", in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an [[Monism#Monism, pantheism, and panentheism|all-encompassing, highest deity]]. "In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. [[Julian the Apostate]] (359–361) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed."&lt;ref name="DDD"/&gt;

===Oracular shrines===
[[File:Delos lions.jpg|thumb|250px|Delos lions]]
Apollo had a famous [[oracle]] in Delphi, and other notable ones in [[Clarus]] and [[Branchidae]]. His oracular shrine in [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]], where he bore the [[toponym]]ic epithet ''[[Abaeus]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων Ἀβαῖος}}, ''Apollon Abaios''), was important enough to be consulted by [[Croesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], 1.46.&lt;/ref&gt;
His oracular shrines include:
* [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]].
* [[Bassae]] in the [[Peloponnese]].
* At [[Clarus]], on the west coast of [[Asia Minor]]; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a ''pneuma'', from which the priests drank.
* In [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of [[Tenea]], from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War.
* At [[Khyrse]], in [[Troad]], the temple was built for Apollo Smintheus.
* In [[Delos]], there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer. The Hieron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was said to have been born.
* In [[Delphi]], the [[Pythia]] became filled with the ''[[pneuma]]'' of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the [[Adyton]].
* In [[Didyma]], an oracle on the coast of [[Anatolia]], south west of [[Lydia]]n ([[Luwian]]) [[Sardis]], in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple. Was believed to have been founded by [[Branchus]], son or lover of Apollo.
* In [[Manbij|Hierapolis Bambyce]], Syria (modern Manbij), according to the treatise ''[[De Dea Syria]]'', the sanctuary of the [[Atargatis|Syrian Goddess]] contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo. Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian]] (attrib.), ''[[De Dea Syria]]'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/tsg/tsg07.htm#35 35–37].&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Patara (Lycia)|Patara]], in [[Lycia]], there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos. As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.
* In [[Segesta]] in Sicily.

Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.
* In [[Oropus]], north of [[Athens]], the oracle [[Amphiaraus]], was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.
* in Labadea, {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Delphi, [[Trophonius]], another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.

==Temples of Apollo==
{{Main|Ancient Greek temple|Roman temple}}

Many temples were dedicated to Apollo in Greece and the Greek colonies. They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in [[Crete]], do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered [[divine]], and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of [[Doric order]]. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection.&lt;ref&gt;To know what a thing is, we must know the look of it": Rhys Carpenter: ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of [[Pythagoras]], who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.&lt;ref name="C. M. Bowra 1957 p. 166"&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Doric order]] dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn't be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the [[Ionic order]], but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the [[Corinthian order]] gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome.

The most important temples are:

===Greek temples===
*[[Thebes, Greece]]: The oldest temple probably dedicated to ''Apollo Ismenius'' was built in the 9th century B.C. It seems that it was a curvilinear building. The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built in the early 7th century B.C., but only some small parts have been found &lt;ref&gt;William Dinsmoor (1950),''The architecture of Ancient Greece'', p. 218, {{ISBN|0-8196-0283-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival called [[Daphnephoria]] was celebrated every ninth year in honour of Apollo Ismenius (or Galaxius). The people held laurel branches (daphnai), and at the head of the procession walked a youth (chosen priest of Apollo), who was called "daphnephoros".&lt;ref name="William Smith 1875. p. 384"&gt;William Smith.'' A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', John Murray, London, 1875. p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eretria]]: According to the Homeric hymn to Apollo, the god arrived to the plain, seeking for a location to establish its oracle. The first temple of ''Apollo Daphnephoros'', "Apollo, laurel-bearer", or "carrying off Daphne", is dated to 800 B.C. The temple was curvilinear ''hecatombedon'' (a hundred feet). In a smaller building were kept the bases of the laurel branches which were used for the first building. Another temple probably peripteral was built in the 7th century B.C., with an inner row of wooden columns over its Geometric predecessor. It was rebuilt peripteral around 510 B.C., with the [[stylobate]] measuring 21,00 x 43,00 m. The number of [[pteron]] column was 6 x 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1689 Hellenic Ministry of culture, Temple of Apollo Daphnephoros] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912212901/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1689 |date=12 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rufus B. Richardson, "A Temple in Eretria" ''The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts'', '''10'''.3 (July – September 1895:326–337)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Dreros]] ([[Crete]]). The temple of ''Apollo Delphinios'' dates from the 7th century B.C., or probably from the middle of the 8th century B.C. According to the legend, Apollo appeared as a dolphin, and carried Cretan priests to the port of [[Delphi]].&lt;ref name="Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 529"&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol&amp;nbsp;I, p.&amp;nbsp;529&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensions of the plan are 10,70 x 24,00 m and the building was not peripteral. It contains column-bases of the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] type, which may be considered as the predecessors of the [[Doric order|Doric]] columns.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson pp. 56 and 323&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gortyn]] ([[Crete]]). A temple of ''Pythian Apollo'', was built in the 7th century B.C. The plan measured 19,00 x 16,70 m and it was not peripteral. The walls were solid, made from limestone, and there was single door on the east side.
*[[Thermon]] ([[West Greece]]): The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple of ''Apollo Thermios'', was built in the middle of the 7th century B.C. It was built on an older curvilinear building dating perhaps from the 10th century B.C., on which a [[peristyle]] was added. The temple was narrow, and the number of pteron columns (probably wooden) was 5 x 15. There was a single row of inner columns. It measures 12.13 x 38.23 m at the stylobate, which was made from stones.&lt;ref name="Spivey, p. 112"&gt;Spivey, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Apollotempel.gif|thumb|left|200px| Floor plan of the temple of Apollo, Corinth]] 
*[[Corinth]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built in the 6th century B.C. The temple's [[stylobate]] measures 21.36 x 53.30 m, and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 15. There was a double row of inner columns. The style is similar with the Temple of Alcmeonidae at [[Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The Corinthians were considered to be the inventors of the [[Doric order]].&lt;ref name="Spivey, p. 112"/&gt; 
*Napes ([[Lesbos]]): An [[Aeolic order|Aeolic]] temple probably of ''Apollo Napaios'' was built in the 7th century B.C. Some special capitals with floral ornament have been found, which are called [[Aeolic order|Aeolic]], and it seems that they were borrowed from the East.&lt;ref name=Robertson324&gt;D.S Robertson(1945):''A handbook of Greek and Roman architecture'', Cambridge University Press pp. 324-329&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Cyrene, Libya]]: The oldest [[Doric order|Doric]] temple of Apollo was built in c. 600 B.C. The number of pteron columns was 6 x 11, and it measures 16.75 x 30.05 m at the stylobate. There was a double row of sixteen inner columns on stylobates. The capitals were made from stone.&lt;ref name=Robertson324/&gt; 
*[[Naukratis]]: An [[Ionic order|Ionic]] temple was built in the early 6th century B.C. Only some fragments have been found and the earlier, made from limestone, are identified among the oldest of the [[Ionic order]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siracusa-Temple-of-Apoll-Plan-bjs.png|thumb|right|200px|Floor plan of the temple of Apollo, Syracuse]]
*[[Syracuse, Sicily]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built at the beginning of the 6th century B.C. The temple's [[stylobate]] measures 21.47 x 55.36 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. It was the first temple in Greek west built completely out of stone. A second row of columns were added, obtaining the effect of an inner porch.&lt;ref&gt;Mertens 2006, pp. 104–109.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Selinus]] ([[Sicily]]):The [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Temple C (Selinus)|Temple C]] dates from 550 B.C., and it was probably dedicated to Apollo. The temple's stylobate measures 10.48 x 41.63 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. There was portico with a second row of columns, which is also attested for the temple at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Inscriptiones Graecorum|IG]] XIV 269&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Delphi]]: The first temple dedicated to Apollo, was built in the 7th century B.C. According to the legend, it was wooden made of laurel branches. The "Temple of Alcmeonidae" was built in c. 513 B.C. and it is the oldest Doric temple with significant marble elements. The temple's stylobate measures 21.65 x 58.00 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-temple-of-apollo.html Temple of Apollo at Delphi], Ancient-Greece.org&lt;/ref&gt; A fest similar with Apollo's fest at [[Thebes, Greece]] was celebrated every nine years. A boy was sent to the temple, who walked on the sacred road and returned carrying a laurel branch (''dopnephoros''). The maidens participated with joyful songs.&lt;ref name="William Smith 1875. p. 384"/&gt; 
*[[Chios]]: An [[Ionic order|Ionic]] temple of ''Apollo Phanaios'' was built at the end of the 6th century B.C. Only some small parts have been found and the capitals had floral ornament.&lt;ref name=Robertson324/&gt; 
*[[Abae]] ([[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]]). The temple was destroyed by the [[Persia]]ns in the invasion of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] in 480 B.C., and later by the [[Boeotia]]ns.

*[[Bassae]] ([[Peloponnesus]]):A temple dedicated to ''Apollo Epikourios'' ("Apollo the helper"), was built in 430 B.C. and it was designed by [[Iktinos]].It combined [[Doric order|Doric]] and [[Ionic order|Ionic]] elements, and the earliest use of column with a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capital in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=6664 Hellenic Ministry of Culture: The Temple of Epicurean Apollo].&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is of a relatively modest size, with the [[stylobate]] measuring 14.5 x 38.3 metres&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;[http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/apolloepicurius.html Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae], World Heritage Site.&lt;/ref&gt; containing a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[peristyle]] of 6 x 15 columns. The roof left a central space open to admit light and air.
*[[Delos]]: A temple probably dedicated to Apollo and not peripteral, was built in the late 7th century B.C., with a plan measuring 10,00 x 15,60 m. The [[Doric order|Doric]] Great temple of Apollo, was built in c. 475 B.C. The temple's stylobate measures 13.72 x 29.78 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 13. Marble was extensively used.&lt;ref name=Robertson324/&gt;
*[[Ambracia]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] peripteral temple dedicated to ''Apollo Pythios Sotir'' was built in 500 B.C., and It is lying at the centre of the Greek city [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. Only some parts have been found, and it seems that the temple was built on earlier sanctuaries dedicated to Apollo. The temple measures 20,75 x 44,00 m at the [[stylobate]].

*[[Didyma]] (near [[Miletus]]): The gigantic [[Ionic order|Ionic]] temple of ''Apollo Didymaios'' started around 540 B.C. The construction ceased and then it was restarted in 330 B.C. The temple is dipteral, with an outer row of 10 x 21 columns, and it measures 28.90 x 80.75 m at the stylobate.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schneider: ''Neue Funde vom archaischen Apollontempel in Didyma''.

*[[Hamaxitus]] ([[Troad]]): In [[Iliad]], [[Chryses]] the priest of Apollo, addresses the god with the epithet Smintheus (Lord of Mice), related with the god's ancient role as bringer of the disease (plague). Recent excavations indicate that the Hellenistic temple of ''Apollo Smintheus'' was constructed at 150–125 B.C., but the symbol of the mouse god was used on coinage probably from the 4th century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Bresson (2007) 154-5, citing the excavations reports of Özgünel (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The temple measures 40,00 x 23,00 m at the [[stylobate]], and the number of pteron columns was 8 x 14.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p.333&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etruscan and Roman temples===
*[[Veii]] ([[Etruria]]): The temple of Apollo was built in the late 6th century B.C. and it indicates the spread of Apollo's culture (Aplu) in Etruria. There was a prostyle porch, which is called [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], and a triple cella 18,50 m wide.&lt;ref name="Robertson pp. 200-201"&gt;Robertson pp. 200-201&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Falerii Veteres]] ([[Etruria]]): A temple of Apollo was built probably in the 4th-3rd century B.C. Parts of a teraccotta capital, and a teraccotta base have been found. It seems that the Etruscan columns were derived from the archaic Doric.&lt;ref name="Robertson pp. 200-201"/&gt; A cult of [[Soranus (mythology)|Apollo Soranus]] is attested by one inscription found near Falerii.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=falerii-veteres Perseus tufts: Falerii Veteres]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Pompeii]] (Italy): The cult of Apollo was widespread in the region of Campania since the 6th century B.C. The temple was built in 120 B.V, but its beginnings lie in the 6th century B.C. It was reconstructed after an earthquake in A.D. 63. It demonstrates a mixing of styles which formed the basis of Roman architecture. The columns in front of the cella formed a [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] prostyle porch, and the cella is situated unusually far back. The peripteral colonnade of 48 [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns was placed in such a way that the emphasis was given to the front side.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson CSA :[http://sites.davidson.edu/csa/the-temple-of-apollo-at-pompeii-a-mishmash-of-architecture/ Temple of Apollo, Pompeii] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106221543/http://sites.davidson.edu/csa/the-temple-of-apollo-at-pompeii-a-mishmash-of-architecture/ |date=6 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rome: The [[temple of Apollo Sosianus]] and the ''temple of Apollo Medicus''. The first temple building dates to 431 B.C., and was dedicated to Apollo Medicus (the doctor), after a plague of 433 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/livy/liv.4.shtml#25 Livy 4.25]&lt;/ref&gt; It was rebuilt by [[Gaius Sosius]], probably in 34 B.C. Only three columns with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals exist today. It seems that the cult of Apollo had existed in this area since at least to the mid-5th century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/livy/liv.34.shtml#43 Livy 34.43]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rome:The [[temple of Apollo Palatinus]] was located on the Palatine hill within the sacred boundary of the city. It was dedicated by [[Augustus]] on 28 B.C. The façade of the original temple was [[Ionic order|Ionic]] and it was constructed from solid blocks of marble. Many famous statues by Greek masters were on display in and around the temple, including a marble statue of the god at the entrance and a statue of Apollo in the cella.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Aedes_Apollinis_Palatini.html A topographical dictionary of Ancient Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
{{Main|Greek mythology}}
Apollo appears often in the myths, plays and hymns. As Zeus' favorite son, Apollo had direct access to the mind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans. A divinity beyond human comprehension, he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god.

===Birth===
[[File:Metropolitan Richart Latona.jpg|thumb|Leto with her children, by William Henry Rinehart]]
When Zeus' wife [[Hera]] discovered that [[Leto]] was impregnanted by Zeus, she banned Leto from giving birth on ''[[Solid Earth|terra firma]]''. In her wanderings, Leto sought shelter on many lands, only to be rejected by them. Finally, Apollo, still in Leto's womb, spoke to his mother and told her about the newly created floating island of [[Delos]], which was neither mainland nor a real island.&lt;ref name="Callimachus, Hymn to Delos"&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Delos''&lt;/ref&gt; Leto, when welcomed by Delos, gave birth there, clinging to a palm tree.

It is also stated that Hera kidnapped [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards or 8.2 meters long.

[[File:Latona with Her Children Apollo and Diana LACMA M.78.86.jpg|thumb|Leto holding Apollo, by Lazar Widmann]]
When Apollo was born clutching a golden sword,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Works and Days|last=Hesiod|date=2007|doi=10.4159/dlcl.hesiod-works_days.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the swans circled Delos seven times and the nymphs sang in delight.&lt;ref name="Callimachus, Hymn to Delos"/&gt; Soon after he was born, he was washed clean by the goddesses and was covered in white garment, with golden bands fastened around him. Since Leto was unable to feed the new born, [[Themis]], the goddess of divine law, fed him the nectar, or [[ambrosia]]. Upon tasting the divine food, Apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared  that he would be the master of [[lyre]] and archery, and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind.&lt;ref&gt;Homeric hymn to Apollo&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Latona with the infants Apollo and Artemis, by Francesco Pozzi, 1824, marble - Sculpture Gallery, Chatsworth House - Derbyshire, England - DSC03504.jpg|thumb|Leto with Apollo and Artemis, by Francesco Pozzi]]
Apollo was a precocious child. Even before he was born, in anger he had foretold the fate of [[Niobe]] and the death of [[Python (mythology)|Python]] during Leto's wanderings.&lt;ref name="Callimachus, Hymn to Delos"/&gt; Leto was accepted by the people of Delos and she promised them that her son would be always favorable towards the city. Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=184}} This island later became sacred to Apollo.

Apollo was born on the seventh day ({{lang|grc|ἑβδομαγενής}}, ''hebdomagenes'')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e(bdomagenh/s|ἑβδομαγενής|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the month [[Attic calendar#Festival calendar|Thargelion]] —according to Delian tradition—or of the month [[Hellenic calendars#Delphic|Bysios]]—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=184}} Mythographers agree that [[Artemis]] was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo, or that Artemis was born on the island of [[Ortygia]] and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo.

===Childhood and Youth===

As a child, Apollo is said to have built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted. Since he learnt the art of building when young, he later became ''[[Archegetes]]'', the founder of towns and god who guided men to build new cities.&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Flaxman - To Phoebus at His Birth, From Aeschylus, Furies - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]] gifts the oracular tripod to Apollo, by John Flaxman]]

In his young years when Zeus had ignored him, Apollo spent his time herding cows. There, he was reared by [[Thriae]], the bee nymphs, who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills.&lt;ref&gt;Homeric Hymn 4 to Hermes 550&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Apollo also invented the lyre, and along with Artemis, the art of archery. He then taught to the humans the art of healing and archery.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, ''Library of history'' 5.74.5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], his grandmother, gave the oracular shrine of [[Delphi]] to Apollo as a birthday gift. Themis inspired him to be the oracular voice of Delphi thereon.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus, ''Eumenides'' 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orphic Hymn 79 to Themis&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Leto (Latona). - Engravings on Wood.jpg|thumb|Python pursuing Leto and her children, engravings on wood]]
Later, with his bow and arrows that he had received from [[Hephaestus]], Apollo went in search of the [[chthonic]] dragon [[Python (mythology)|Python]], which lived in [[Delphi]] beside the [[Castalian Spring]], and was a terror to the people. Hera had sent this serpent to hunt the pregnant Leto to her death across the world. To avenge the trouble given to his mother, Apollo killed Python in the sacred cave at Delphi with his arrows.&lt;ref&gt;''Children of the Gods'' by Kenneth McLeish, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he had freed the people from a great bane, Python was a child of [[Gaia]]. Zeus, not wanting to incur her anger, decided to punished Apollo.

[[File:Apollo Killing the Python LACMA 54.70.1i.jpg|thumb|Apollo killing the Python, by Hendrik Goltzius]]

Zeus banned Apollo from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], and told him to purify himself. Exiled, Apollo had to serve as a slave for nine years.&lt;ref&gt;John Lemprière, ''Bibliotheca Classica''&lt;/ref&gt; He also travelled to [[Crete]], where [[Carmanor (deity)|Carmanor]] performed purification rites on him. Further, Zeus ordered him to go to the [[Vale of Tempe]] and bath in waters of [[Pineios (Thessaly)|Peneus]].&lt;ref&gt;The Uses of Greek Mythology
By Ken Dowden&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo later established the [[Pythian games]] to appropriate Gaia. Only after this, he was given his place on Olympus. Henceforth, Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder and, made men aware of their guilt and purified them.&lt;ref&gt;Apollo, Fritz Graf&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeus, for his son's integrity, gave Apollo the seat next to him on his right side. He also gifted to Apollo a golden tripod, bow and arrows, a golden chariot drawn by swans and the land of Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Acosta-Hughes, Luigi Lehnus, Susan Stephens - ''Brill's Companion to Callimachus''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:7003.Apollo mit dem getöteten Python(1752)-François Gaspard Adam-Große Fontäne-Sanssouci Steffen Heilfort.JPG|thumb|Apollo victorious over the Python, by François Gaspard Adam]]

Soon after his return, Apollo needed to recruit people to Delphi. So, when he spotted a ship sailing from Crete, he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin. The crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to Delphi. There Apollo revealed himself as a god. Initiating them to his service, he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts. The [[Pythia]] was Apollo's high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies. Pythia is arguably the constant favorite of Apollo among the mortals. 
 
[[File:Apollo Tityos Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2689.jpg|thumb|Apollo slaying [[Tityos]], Attic red-figure kylix, 460–450 BC]]

Hera once again sent another giant, [[Tityos]] to rape Leto. This time Apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword. According to variations, Artemis aided in protecting their mother by attacking with her arrows. After the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to [[Tartarus]]. There, he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of {{convert|9|acre|m2}}, where a pair of [[vulture]]s feasted daily on his liver.

===Exile in Troy===

Once Apollo, along with [[Athena]] and [[Poseidon]], participated in Hera's scheme to hold Zeus captive and demand a better rule from him. This was unsuccessful and Zeus, feeling beatryed, sent Apollo and Poseidon to serve as slaves under the Trojan king [[Laomedon]]. According to varied version, both gods went to test Laomedon. Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of mount Ida, while Poseidon built the walls of Troy. There, Apollo had a lover named Ourea, and sired a son Ileus by her.

[[File:Sandrart (attributed), Troppa (attr.) - Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo - 17th c.jpg|thumb|Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo, by [[Joachim von Sandrart]]]]

Later, Apollo was also compelled by Laomedon to build the walls. Apollo obeyed, and by playing on his lyre, he built the walls of Troy. However, the king refused to give them the wages he had promised. Angered, Apollo sent a pestilence to the city. To deliver the city from it, Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter [[Hesione]] (who would later be saved by [[Heracles]]).

===Trojan War===

Apollo sided with the Trojans during the [[Trojan war]], a war waged by the Greeks against the Trojans.

During the war, [[Agamemnon]], a Greek hero captured [[Chryseis]], the daughter of Apollo's priest [[Chryses]]. Angered, Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment. He demanded to return the girl, and the Achaeans (Greeks) complied, indirectly causing the ''[[Achilles and Patroclus#In the Iliad|anger of Achilles]]'', which is the theme of the ''[[Iliad]]''.
 
[[File:John Flaxman - Apollo Preceding Hector with His Aegis, and Dispersing the Greeks, Fuseli's Lectures - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Apollo preceding [[Hector]] with his [[Aegis]], and dispersing the Greeks, by John Flaxman]]

Receiving the [[aegis]] from Zeus, Apollo entered the battlefield, causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry, pushing them back and destroying many of them. He is described as "the rouser of armies", because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart.

[[File:(28) Flaxman Ilias 1793, gestochen 1795, 192 x 343 mm.jpg|thumb|The gods taking sides. Apollo (naked with a bow and arrow) sides with the Trojans, by John Flaxman]]

When Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war, Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel. However, Apollo declined to fight him, saying that he wouldn't fight his uncle for the sake of mortals.

[[File:Diomedes prevented by Apollo from pursuing Aeneas (?) MET 80355.jpg|thumb|Apollo prevents [[Diomedes]] from pursuing [[Aeneas]]]]

When [[Diomedes]], the greek hero, injured [[Aeneas]], a Trojan ally, [[Aphrodite]] tried to rescue him but Diomedes injured her as well. Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him. He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain himself from attacking a god. Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos, a sacred spot in [[Troy]], where he was healed.

After the death of [[Sarpedon]], a son of Zeus, Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father's wish and cleaned it. He then gave it to Sleep ([[Hypnos]]) and Death ([[Thanatos]]). Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day, so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while.

[[File:Hector's body dragged at the Chariot of Achilles.jpg|thumb|Apollo protecting Hector's body, by John Flaxman]]

The Trojan hero [[Hector]] was favored by Apollo, who, according to some, was the god's own son by [[Hecuba]].&lt;ref&gt;Teztez on Lycophron, 266&lt;/ref&gt; When he got injured, Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up the arms. During a duel with Achilles, when Hector was about to lose, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him. At last, after Hector's fated death, Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles' attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse.

The Greek warrior [[Patroclus]] tried to get into the fort of Troy and was stopped by Apollo. Encouraging Hector to attack Patroclus, Apollo stripped the armour of Patroclus and broke his weapons. Patroclus was eventually killed by Hector.

[[File:Achilles slaying Troilus.PNG|thumb|[[Achilles]] slaying [[Troilus]]]]

Apollo held anger towards Achilles throughout the war. The reason for this was the murder of his son [[Tenes]] before the war began, and brutal assassination of his another son [[Troilus]] in his own temple, both by Achilles. Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles, he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates. He foiled Achilles' attempt to mutilate Hector's dead body.

[[File:Paris armour Pomarici Santomasi.jpg|thumb|Paris (on the left) putting on his armour as Apollo (on the right) watches him. Attic red-figure kantharos, 425 - 420 BC]]
Finally, Apollo caused Achilles' death by guiding an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] into [[Achilles]]' heel. In some versions, Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris.

Apollo helped many Trojan warriors, including [[Agenor]], [[Polydamas (mythology)|Polydamas]], [[Glaucus]] in the battlefield. Though he greatly favored the Trojans, Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war.

===Admetus===
[[File:Drawing, Apollo Guards the Herds (or Flocks) of King Admetus, 1780–1800 (CH 18122047).jpg|thumb|Apollo Guards the Herds (or Flocks) of King [[Admetus]], by Felice Gianni]]

When Zeus struck down Apollo's son [[Asclepius]] with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead, Apollo in revenge killed the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliothke]]'' iii. 10.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo would have been banished to [[Tartarus]] forever for this, but his mother [[Leto]] intervened, and reminding Zeus of their old love, pleaded him not to kill their son. Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of [[Penal labour|hard labor]].

During this time he served as herdsman for [[Admetus|King Admetus]] of [[Pherae]] in [[Thessaly]]. His mere presence is said to have made the cows give birth to twins. Apollo shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay.&lt;ref name="Callimachus hymn to Apollo"&gt;Callimachus hymn to Apollo&lt;/ref&gt;
Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus. Out of love and gratitude, Apollo helped Admetus win [[Alcestis]], the daughter of [[Pelias|King Pelias]] and later convinced, or tricked the [[Moirai|Fates]] to let Admetus live past his time.

The love between Apollo and Admetus was a favorite topic of Roman poets like [[Ovid]] and [[Servius]].

===Niobe===
[[File:Pierre-Charles Jombert - Les enfants de Niobé tués par Apollon et Diane.JPG|thumb|250px|''Niobe's children are killed by Apollo and Diana'' by [[Pierre-Charles Jombert]]]]

The fate of [[Niobe]] was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto's womb.&lt;ref name="Callimachus hymn to Apollo"/&gt; Niobe was the queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]]. She displayed [[hubris]] when she boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. She further mocked Apollo's effeminate appearance and Artemis' manly appearance. Leto, insulted by this, told her children to punish Niobe. Accordingly, Apollo killed Niobe's sons, and Artemis her daughters. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, among the Niobids, Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.

A devastated Niobe fled to [[Spil Mount|Mount Sipylos]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river [[Achelous]]. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.

Zeus, moved by Apollo's words and the tears of Artemis and Leto, sent Heracles to free Prometheus.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica 4. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicolas-Guy Brenet - Apollo Crowning the Arts, 1771.jpg|thumb|Apollo crowning the arts, by [[Nicolas-Guy Brenet]]]]
 
[[Chiron]], the abandoned [[centaur]] was fostered by Apollo who instructed him in medicine, prophecy, archery and more. Chiron's calm nature and wisdom, in contrast to rest of the centaurs, is attributed to the education Apollo gave him.

Apollo adopted [[Carnus]], the abandoned son of Zeus and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]]. He fostered him with the help of his mother Leto and later educated the child. 
 
Apollo personally readied his son [[Aristaeus]] for the Indian war by providing him with bow, arrows and a shield.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, Dionysiaca 13. 253 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, he also rescued Aristaeus from drowning in a river during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, Dionysiaca 24. 77 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anius]], Apollo's son by [[Rhoeo]], was abandoned by his mother. Apollo brought him up and educated him. Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos. In a similar fashion, he had educated his sons [[Idmon]] and [[Iamus]] (by taking him to Olympia).

Upon the death of his son [[Idmon]], Apollo commanded the Megarians and Boetians to build a town around the tomb of the hero, and to honor him for his bravery and sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius. Argonautica ii, 846 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo saved a shepherd (name unknown) from death in a large deep cave, by the means of vultures. To thank him, the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius.&lt;ref&gt;The Cyclopedia, Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature, Volume 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo guided Aphrodite to his sanctuary when she was grief-stricken with [[Adonis]]' death. He helped her free herself from the heartbreak.
 
Apollo divides months into summer and winter.&lt;ref&gt;Orphic hymn to Apollo&lt;/ref&gt; He rides on the back of a swan to the land of the [[Hyperborea]]ns during the winter months,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and the absence of warmth in winters is due to his departure. During his absence, Delphi was under the care of [[Dionysus]], and no prophecies were given during winters.

===Apollo, the god of music===

Apollo's music is soulful and enchanting. His music would deliver people from their pain, and hence, like Dionysus, he is also called the liberator.&lt;ref name="Callimachus hymn to Apollo"/&gt;

Apollo is often seen as the companion of the [[Muses]] and as ''[[Musagetes]]'', he leads them into dance while he sang. He is found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the [[lyre]].&lt;ref&gt;Iliad (i. 603)&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo and the Muses are often seen on [[Parnassus]], which is one of their favorite spots.

[[File:Parnassus, Andrea Appiani (1811).jpg|thumb|Apollo and the Muses on Parnassus, by [[Andrea Appiani]]]]

Apollo was always invited to play music on weddings of the gods, like the marriage of [[Eros]] and [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]].

====Apollo's lyre====
[[File:Apollon Raon Versailles MV5921.jpg|thumb|Apollon Raon, [[Versailles]]]]

The invention of lyre is attributed either to Hermes or to Apollo himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeric Hymn to Hermes (IV, 1-506)|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0138%3ahymn%3d4|website=Perseus|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell, where as the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus&lt;/ref&gt;

Myths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo's cows and took them to a cave in the woods near [[Pylos]], covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a [[tortoise]] and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made his [[lyre]].

[[File:Noël Coypel - Story of Apollo-Apollo and Mercury, 1688.jpg|thumb|The friendship of Apollo and Hermes, by [[Noël Coypel]]]]

Upon discovering the theft, Apollo confronted Hermes and asked him to return his cattle. When Hermes acted innocent, Apollo took the matter to Zeus. Zeus, having seen the events, sided with Apollo, and ordered Hermes to return the cattle. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became a master of the lyre.

[[File:Detail of the statue of Apollo holding the kithara, from the Temple of Venus (Casino Fede) at Hadrian's Villa, Ny Carlsberg Glyptoteket (12233881783).jpg|thumb|Detail of Apollo's lyre]]

According to other versions, Apollo had invented the lyre himself, whose strings he tore in repent to the excess punishment he had given to [[Marsyas]]. Hermes' lyre, therefore, is rather a reinvention.&lt;ref&gt;Norman O. Brown, ''Hermes the thief''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Musical contests====

Apollo participated in musical contests when challenged by others. He was the victor in all the contests, but usually punished his opponents severely for their [[hubris]].

====Pan====
[[File:Laurits Regner Tuxen The-Musical-Dual-Of-Pan-And-Apollo.jpg|thumb|The musical dual of Pan and Apollo, by [[Laurits Tuxen]]]]
Once [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge Apollo, the god of music. The mountain-god [[Tmolus]] was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[Midas]], who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and everyone were pleased with the judgement. Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]].

====Marsyas====
[[Marsyas]] was a [[satyr]] who was punished by Apollo for his [[hubris]].

[[File:Athena Marsyas.jpg|thumb|[[Athena]] and [[Marsyas]]]]

He had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[Athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument, that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished. When Marsyas played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the [[Muse]]s. The contestants agreed to the rule that the victor can do anything with the loser.

[[File:05apol1.jpg|thumb|The contest between Apollo and [[Marsyas]] by [[Palma il Giovane]]]]

After they each performed, both were deemed equal until Apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time. Marsyas argued against this, saying that Apollo would have an advantage. But Apollo presented the counterpoint that since Marsyas played the flute, which needed air blown from the throat, it was same as singing. The judges agreed with Apollo. Apollo played his lyre and sang at the same time, mesmerising the audience. Marsyas could not do this, as he only knew how to use the flute and not singing. Apollo was declared the winner because of this.

According to some, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack.&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus the Younger, Imagines 2 (trans. Fairbanks)&lt;/ref&gt;
Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the [[flute]]), and so Apollo hung him from a tree to flay him alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Man Myth and Magic'' by Richard Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo - Charles André van Loo (1735).jpg|thumb|Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo, by	[[Charles-André van Loo]]]]

Apollo [[flaying|flayed]] Marsyas alive in a cave near [[Celaenae]] in [[Phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. He then nailed Marsyas' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree. Marsyas' blood turned into the river Marsyas. But, as an act of repent and purification for killing Marsyas, he tore the strings of his lyre. Staying away from music for a long time, he isolated himself and wandered with [[Cybele]] till he reached [[Hyperborea]], his mother's native.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 75. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apostle Arne Horn, ''The Book of Eusebius'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cinyras====

Cinyras was a ruler of [[Cyprus]], who was a friend of [[Agamemnon]]. Cinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan war, but did not keep his promise. Agamemnon cursed Cinyras. He invoked Apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise. Apollo then had a [[lyre]]-playing contest with [[Cinyras]], and defeated him. Either Cinyras committed suicide when he lost, or was killed by Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Iliad, 11. 20-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on Iliad; cf. also scholia on the same passage&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollon citharède et Victoire Louvre Ma965.jpg|thumb|Apollo being served by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] (victory), Louvre]]

===Female lovers===

Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;"The love-stories themselves were not told until later." [[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Gods of the Greeks'' 1951:140.&lt;/ref&gt; Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.

{{Main|Apollo and Daphne}}

[[File:Apollo and Daphne (Bernini).jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Apollo and Daphne]]'' by [[Bernini]] in the [[Galleria Borghese]]]]
[[Daphne]] was a [[nymph]] whose parentage varies. She scorned Apollo's adavnces and ran away from him. When Apollo chased her in order to persuade her, she changed herself into a laurel tree. According to other versions, she cried for help during the chase, and [[Gaea]] helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheDaphne.html]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roman poet [[Ovid]], the chase was brought about by [[Cupid]], who hit Apollo with golden arrow of love and Daphne with leaden arrow of hatred. The myth explains the origin of the [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] and connection of Apollo with the laurel and it's leaves, which his priestess employed at [[Delphi]]. The leaves  became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the [[Pythian games]].

[[File:Robert Sanderson - Apollo and the Muses.jpg|thumb|Apollo and the Muses, by Robert Sanderson]]
Apollo is said to have been the lover of all nine [[Muses]], and not being able to choose one of them, decided to remain unwed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ApollonLoves.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He fathered the [[Corybantes]] by the Muse [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]],&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html ''Bibliotheca'', 1.3.4].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orpheus]] by [[Calliope]], [[Linus (Thracian)|Linus of Thrace]] by Calliope or [[Urania]] and [[Hymenaios]](Hymen) by either [[Terpsichore]] or [[Clio]] or Calliope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/ErosHymenaios.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cyrene and Cattle - Edward Calvert.jpg|thumb|Cyrene and Cattle, by [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]]]]
[[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]], was a Thessalian princess whom Apollo loved. In her honor, he built the city Cyrene and made her its ruler. She was later granted longevity by Apollo who turned her into a nymph. The couple had two sons, [[Aristaeus]], and [[Idmon]].

[[Evadne]] was a nymph daughter of Poseidon and a lover of Apollo. She bore him a son, [[Iamos]]. During the time of the childbirth, Apollo sent [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth to assist her.

[[Rhoeo]], a princess of the island of Naxos was loved by Apollo. Out of affection for her, Apollo turned her sisters into goddesses. On the island Delos she bore Apollo a son named [[Anius]]. Not wanting to have the child, she entrusted the infant to Apollo and left. Apollo raised and educated the child on his own.

Ourea, a daughter of [[Poseidon]], fell in love with Apollo when he and Poseidon were serving the Trojan king [[Laomedon]]. They both united on the day the walls of [[Troy]] were built. She bore to Apollo a son, whom Apollo named Ileus, after the city of his birth, Ilion ([[Troy]]). Ileus was very dear to Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Catalogues of Women Fragment'' 83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thero (mythology)|Thero]], daughter of [[Phylas]], a maiden as beautiful as the moonbeams, was loved by the radiant Apollo, and she loved him in return. By their union, she became mother of Chaeron, who was famed as "the tamer of horses". He later built the city [[Chaeronea]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyrie or Thyrie was the mother of [[Cycnus (son of Apollo)|Cycnus]]. Apollo turned both the mother and son into swans when they jumped into a lake and tried to kill themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Heros/KyknosThyrios.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hecuba]] was the wife of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]], and Apollo had a son with her named [[Troilus]]. An [[oracle]] prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was ambushed and killed by [[Achilleus]], and Apollo avenged his death by killing Achilles.

[[Coronis (Greek mythology)|Coronis]], was daughter of [[Phlegyas]], King of the [[Lapiths]]. While pregnant with [[Asclepius]], Coronis fell in love with [[Ischys]], son of [[Elatus]] and slept with him. When Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers, he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. Apollo rescued the baby by cutting open Koronis' belly and gave it to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] to raise.

In [[Euripides]]' play ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'', Apollo fathered [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] by [[Creusa (daughter of Erechtheus)|Creusa]], wife of [[Xuthus]]. He used his powers to conceal her pregnancy from her father. Later, when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, Apollo asked [[Hermes]] to save the child and bring him to the oracle at [[Delphi]], where he was raised by a priestess.

===Male lovers===

[[File:Cesio, Carlo 1626 - 1686) - Apollo e Giacinto, inc. da Annibale Carracci, -1675-.jpg|thumb|''Apollo and Hyacinthus'', by Carlo Cesio]]
[[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]] or Hyacinthus was Apollo's favorite lover. He was a [[Sparta]]n prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair was practicing throwing the [[Discus throw|discus]] when the discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous [[Zephyrus]] and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief: out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a [[hyacinth (plant)|flower]] named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection {{lang|grc|αἰαῖ}}, meaning ''alas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ai)ai{{=}}|αἰαῖ}}, {{LSJ|ai)/2|αἴ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was later resurrected and taken to heaven. The festival [[Hyacinthia]] was a national celebration of Sparta, which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus.
[[File:Kiselev Death of Hyacinth.jpg|thumb|Death of Hyacinth, by [[Alexander Kiselyov (painter)|Alexander Kiselyov]]]]

Another male lover was [[Cyparissus]], a descendant of [[Heracles]]. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a [[Pilum|javelin]] as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus was so saddened by it's death that he asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the [[Cupressaceae|Cypress]] named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.

[[File:Granger-Apollo.jpg|thumb|Apollo and Cyparissus, by Jean-Pierre Granger (1779–1840)]]

[[Admetus]], the king of Pherae, was Apollo's another dear lover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Callimachus]], Hymn to Apollo, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Numa"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'', 4. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; During his exile, which lasted either for one year or nine years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KEAVENEY|first=ARTHUR|date=1984-01-01|title=A NOTE ON SERVIUS, AD AENEID 7, 637|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1524/phil.1984.128.12.138|journal=Philologus|volume=128|issue=1-2|doi=10.1524/phil.1984.128.12.138|issn=2196-7008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman. Developing a passion for the king there, he herded and fed the cattle, and caused the cows to give birth to twin calves. He would make cheese and serve it to Admetus and was often seen being domestic, causing embarrassment to his family. 
[[File:Nicolas-Antoine Taunay - Apollo visiting Admetus, cropped.jpeg|thumb|Apollo (playing the flute) and Admetus, by [[Nicolas-Antoine Taunay]]]]
{{quote| Oh how often his sister (Diana) blushed at meeting her brother as he carried a young calf through the fields!....often Latona lamented when she saw her son's disheveled locks which were admired even by Juno, his step-mother...&lt;ref&gt;Tibullus, ''Elegies'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When Admetus wanted to marry princess [[Alcestis]], Apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed. This satisfied Alcestis' father and he let  Admetus marry his daughter. Further, Apollo saved the king from Artemis' wrath and also convinced the [[Moirai]] to postpone Admetus' death once.

[[Branchus]], a shepherd, one day came across Apollo in the woods. Captivated by the god's beauty, he kissed Apollo. Apollo requited his affections and wanting to reward him, bestowed prophetic skills on him. His descendants, the Branchides, were an influential clan of prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Pepin, Ronald E. (2008). The Vatican Mythographers. Fordham Univ Press. {{ISBN|9780823228928}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other male lovers of Apollo include:

*[[Adonis]], who is said to have been the lover of both Apollo and Aphrodite.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ptolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 4 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Atymnius]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', 11. 258; 19. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known as a beloved of [[Sarpedon]]
* Hippolytus of [[Sicyon]] (not the same as [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus, the son of Theseus]])&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Numa" /&gt;
*[[Hymenaios]], god of marriage hymns (here, the son of [[Magnes (son of Argos)|Magnes]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Iapis]]
*[[Phorbas]], the dragon slayer (probably the son of Triopas)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'', 4. 5, cf. also [[Hyginus]], ''Poetical Astronomy'', 2. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===

Apollo sired many children, from mortal women, nymphs as well as the goddesses. His children grew up to be physicians, musicians, poets, seers or archers. Many of his sons founded new cities and became kings. They were all usually very beautiful.

[[File:1590. Apollo Entrusting Chiron with the Education of Aescalapius - etching - Washington DC, NGA.jpg|thumb|Apollo Entrusting [[Chiron]] with the Education of Aescalapius]]

[[Asclepius]] is the most famous son of Apollo. Apollo brought the child into the world by performing [[cesarean]]. His skills as a physician surpassed that of Apollo's. Zeus killed him for bringing back the dead, but later upon Apollo's request, he was resurrected as a god.

[[Aristaeus]], the son of Apollo and [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]], was placed under the care of Chiron after his birth. He became the god of beekeeping, cheese making, animal husbandry and more. He was ultimately given immortality for the benefits he bestowed upon the humanity.

The [[Corybantes]] were spear-clashing, dancing demigods. They were seven sons of Apollo and the nymph Rhetia or the Muse [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]].

Apollo's children who became musicians and bards include [[Orpheus]], [[Linus (mythology)|Linus]], [[Ialemus]], [[Hymen (god)|Hymen]]aeus, [[Philammon]], and [[Eleuther]].

[[Apis (mythology)|Apis]], [[Idmon]], [[Iamus]], [[Tenerus (son of Apollo)|Tenerus]], [[Mopsus]] and others were gifted seers. [[Anius]], Pythaeus and [[Ismenus]] lived as high priests. Most of them were trained by Apollo himself.

[[Delphos (mythology)|Delphos]], Dryops, [[Miletos]], [[Tenes]], [[Epidaurus]], [[Ceos]], [[Lycorus|Lycoras]], [[Syrus]], Pisus, [[Marathus]], [[Acraepheus]], Cicon, Chaeron and many other sons of Apollo, under the guidance of his words, founded eponymous cities.

Apollo fathered 3 daughters, Nete, Mese, Hypate, who formed a minor group of Muses, the "Musa Apollonides". They were worshipped at Apollo's shrine in Delphi and  are named after the highest, middle and lowest strings of his lyre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/MousaiApollonides.html]&lt;/ref&gt; His other daughters are [[Phemonoe]] (the poetess and seer), [[Eriopis]] (known for her lovely hair), [[Pamphile]] (silk weaver), Phoebe and Hilyra (the wives of [[Dioscuri]]), Parthenos (turned into a constellation upon her death) and by some accounts, [[Scylla]].

Additionally, Apollo fostered and educated [[Chiron]], the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods, including Apollo's sons. Apollo also fostered [[Carnus]], the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]].

===Failed love attempts===

[[Marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[Idas]] but was loved by Apollo as well. [[Zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.

[[Sinope (mythology)|Sinope]], a nymph, was approached by the amorous Apollo. She made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for, and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin. Apollo kept his promise and went back.

[[Bolina]] was admired by Apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea. To avoid her death, Apollo turned her into a nymph and let her go.

[[Castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the [[castalian Spring|spring]] at Delphi, at the base of [[Mt. Parnassos]], which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.

[[Cassandra]], was a daughter of Hecuba and Priam. Apollo wished to court her. Cassandra promised to return his love on one condition - he should give her the power to see the future. Apollo fulfilled her wish, but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after. Angered that she broke her promise, Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies.

[[Hestia]], the goddess of the hearth, rejected both Apollo's and Poseidon's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried.

===Female counterparts===

====Artemis====

[[File:Apollo Artemis Brygos Louvre G151.jpg|thumb|250px|Apollo (left) and [[Artemis]]. [[Brygos]] (potter signed), tondo of an Attic red-figure cup c. 470 BC, [[Musée du Louvre]].]]

Artemis as the sister of Apollo, is ''thea apollousa'', that is, she as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity. In the pre-hellenic period, their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo. However, this relationship was never sexual but spiritual,&lt;ref&gt;Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1197&lt;/ref&gt; which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the [[Hellenic period]].&lt;ref name="theoi.com"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Artemis.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gavin Hamilton - Apollo and Artemis, 1770.jpg|thumb|Apollo and Artemis, by Gavin Hamilton]]

Artemis, like her brother, is armed with a bow and arrows. She is the cause of sudden deaths of women. She also is the protector of the young, especially girls. Though she has nothing to do with oracles, music or poetry, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"/&gt; The laurel was  sacred to both. ''Artemis Daphnaia'' had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi.&lt;ref&gt;G. Shipley, "The Extent of Spartan Territory in the Late Classical and Hellenistic Periods", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or Helios, Artemis was naturally regarded as Selene or the moon. 
The Laurel was sacred to both. ''Apollo Daphnephoros'' had a temple in [[Eretria]], a "place where the citizens are to take the oaths.&lt;ref&gt;Rufus B. Richardson, "A Temple in Eretria" ''The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts'', '''10'''.3 (July - September 1895:326–337); Paul Auberson, ''Eretria. Fouilles et Recherches I, Temple d'Apollon Daphnéphoros, Architecture'' (Bern, 1968). See also [[Plutarch]], ''Pythian Oracle'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hecate====

[[Hecate]], the goddess of witchcraft and magic, is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo. They both are cousins, since their mothers - [[Leto]] and [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]] - are sisters. One of Apollo's epithets, ''Hecatos'', is the masculine form of Hecate, and both the names mean "working from afar". While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven, Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanKoios.html]&lt;/ref&gt; If Hecate is the "gate-keeper", Apollo ''Agyieus'' is the "door-keeper". Hecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo is the god and protector of streets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Carol M. Mooney, B.A., ''Hekate : 
Her Role And Character 
In Greek Literature 
From Before The Fifth Century B.C.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jusepe de Ribera - Hecate, Procession to a Witches' Sabbath.jpg|thumb|Hecate's procession by the witches, by [[Jusepe de Ribera]]]]

[[File:Guido Reni 008.jpg|thumb|Apollo accompanied by the [[Horae]] (hours) and [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], by [[Guido Reni]]]]

The oldest evidence found for Hecate's worship is at Apollo's temple in Miletos. There, Hecate was taken to be Apollo's sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Hecate's lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrats and complements, at the same time, Apollo's solar nature.

====Athena====

As a deity of knowledge and great power, Apollo was seen being the male counterpart of [[Athena]]. Being Zeus' favorite children, they were given more powers and duties. Apollo and Athena often took up the role as protectors of cities, and were patrons of some of the important cities. Athena was the principle goddess of [[Athens]], Apollo was the principle god of [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://publicism.info/culture/apollo/7.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Houbraken, Arnold - Pallas Athene Visiting Apollo on the Parnassus - 1703.jpeg|thumb|Pallas Athene Visiting Apollo on the Parnassus, by [[Arnold Houbraken]]]]

As patrons of arts, Apollo and Athena were companions of the [[Muses]], the former a much more frequent companion than the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dawkins, ''The Shakespeare Enigma''&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo was somtimes called the son of Athena and Hephaestus due to his wise and artistic nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Athena.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Trojan war, as Zeus' executive, Apollo is seen holding the [[aegis]] like Athena usually does.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Iliad 15.308&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena, and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;1.Homer, ''Iliad'', Euripides, ''Ion'', Aeschylus, ''Oresteia''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apollo in the ''Oresteia''===
In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy, [[Clytemnestra]] kills her husband, King [[Agamemnon]] because he had sacrificed their daughter [[Iphigenia]] to proceed forward with the Trojan war. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, [[Orestes]], is to kill Clytemnestra and [[Aegisthus]], her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the [[Erinyes]] or Furies (female personifications of [[revenge|vengeance]]).

Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the [[matricide]] was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he drives them away. He says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's [[Supplication|supplicant]]. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo.

===Roman Apollo===

The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}} As a quintessentially [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god]], Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as '''Phoebus'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Koronis.html |title=Koronis |publisher=Theoi |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the [[Roman Kingdom|kings of Rome]] during the reign of [[Tarquinius Superbus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Liv.+1.56 1.56].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's [[Temple of Apollo Sosianus|first temple]] at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the "Apollinare".&lt;ref&gt;Livy [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=3:chapter=63 3.63.7], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0145:book=4:chapter=25 4.25.3].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Punic War]] in 212 BCE, the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'' ("Apollonian Games") were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0147:book=25:chapter=12 25.12].&lt;/ref&gt; In the time of [[Augustus]], who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. H. W. G. Liebeschuetz |title=Continuity and Change in Roman Religion |year=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-814822-4 |pages=82–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}}

After the [[battle of Actium]], which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted [[quinquennial]] games in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars#Life of Augustus|Augustus]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#18.2 18.2]; [[Cassius Dio]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#1 51.1.1–3].&lt;/ref&gt; He also erected [[Temple of Apollo (Palatine)|a new temple]] to the god on the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#1.3 53.1.3].&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] formed the culmination of the [[Secular Games]], held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 5050, translated by {{cite book |last1=Beard |first1=Mary |authorlink=Mary Beard (classicist) |last2=North |first2=John |last3=Price |first3=Simon |title=Religions of Rome: Volume 2: A Sourcebook |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-45015-2|page=5.7b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
The chief Apollonian festival was the [[Pythian Games]] held every four years at Delphi and was one of the four great [[Panhellenic Games]]. Also of major importance was the  [[Delia (festival)|Delia]] held every four years on Delos.
Athenian annual festivals included the [[Boedromia]], [[Metageitnia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=William |title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1890),MACELLUM, MATRA'LIA, METAGEI'TNIA |date=1890 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DM%3Aentry+group%3D2%3Aentry%3Dmetageitnia-cn |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyanepsia]], and [[Thargelia]].
Spartan annual festivals were the  [[Carneia]] and the  [[Hyacinthia]].
[[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] every nine years held the [[Daphnephoria]].

==Attributes and symbols==

Apollo's most common attributes were the bow and [[arrow]]. Other attributes of his included the [[kithara]] (an advanced version of the common [[lyre]]), the [[plectrum]] and the sword. Another common emblem was the [[sacrificial tripod]], representing his prophetic powers. The [[Pythian Games]] were held in Apollo's honor every four years at [[Delphi]]. The [[bay laurel]] plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the [[laurel wreath|crown of victory]] at these games.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}}

The [[palm tree]] was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in [[Delos]]. Animals sacred to Apollo included [[wolf|wolves]], dolphins, [[roe deer]], [[swan]]s, [[cicada]]s (symbolizing music and song), [[hawk]]s, [[raven]]s, [[Corvus (genus)|crow]]s, snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice and [[griffin]]s, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}}

[[File:Apolocitaredo8.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Apollo Citharoedus]]'' ("Apollo with a kithara"), [[Musei Capitolini]], Rome]]
As god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750–550 BCE. According to Greek tradition, he helped [[Crete|Cretan]] or [[Arcadia]]n colonists found the city of [[Troy]]. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts mention a Minor Asian god called ''Appaliunas'' or ''Apalunas'' in connection with the city of [[Wilusa]] attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek [[Troy|Ilion]] by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of ''Lykegenes'' can simply be read as "born in Lycia", which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a [[folk etymology]]).

In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of [[Dionysus]], god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for [[Hyperborea]], he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the [[Borghese Vase]].

Apollo is often associated with the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|Golden Mean]]. This is the Greek [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of [[moderation]] and a [[virtue]] that opposes [[gluttony]].

==Apollo in the arts==
[[File:Apollo Saurocton Louvre.jpg|thumb|180px|The Louvre ''Apollo Sauroctonos'', Roman copy after [[Praxiteles]] (360 BC)]]
Apollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the [[Renaissance]]. The earliest Greek word for a statue is "delight" ({{lang|grc|ἄγαλμα}}, ''agalma''), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. Greek art puts into Apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.

The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity. The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment. The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.

The evolution of the Greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal [[Kouros]] type in [[Archaic period in Greece|early archaic period]], to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in [[Archaic period in Greece|late archaic period]]. In [[classical Greece]] the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms, but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole, a method created by [[Polykleitos]]. Finally [[Praxiteles]] seems to be released from any art and religious conformities, and his masterpieces are a mixture of [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]] with stylization.

===Art and Greek philosophy===
The evolution of the Greek art seems to go parallel with the Greek philosophical conceptions, which changed from the natural-philosophy of [[Thales]] to the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory of [[Pythagoras]]. Thales searched for a simple material-form directly perceptible by the senses, behind the appearances of things, and his theory is also related to the older [[animism]]. This was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life, through unnaturally simplified forms.&lt;ref name="Homann63"&gt;E. Homann-Wedeking. Transl. J.R. Foster (1968). ''Art of the world. Archaic Greece'', Methuen &amp; Co Ltd. London, pp. 63–65, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation.&lt;ref name="C. M. Bowra 1957 p. 166"/&gt; The forms on earth, are imperfect imitations ({{lang|grc|εἰκόνες}}, ''eikones'', "images") of the celestial world of numbers. His ideas had a great influence on post-Archaic art. The Greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation, that would lead to the esthetic perfection.&lt;ref name="Carpenter55"&gt;R. Carpenter (1975). ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. pp. 55–58.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Aesthetic canon|canon]]).

In classical Greece, [[Anaxagoras]] asserted that a divine reason (mind) gave order to the seeds of the universe, and [[Plato]] extended the Greek belief of ''ideal forms'' to his metaphysical theory of ''forms'' (''ideai'', "ideas"). The forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas. The Greek words ''oida'' ({{lang|grc|οἶδα}}, "(I) know") and ''eidos'' ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}}, "species"), a thing seen, have the same root as the word ''idea'' ({{lang|grc|ἰδέα}}), a thing ἰδείν to see.&lt;ref&gt;"The same root of looking or seeing" . R. Carpenter (1975). ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. p.107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|idea}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses, to the principles beyond the senses. The artists in Plato's time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization. The Greek sculptors considered the senses more important, and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual.

===Archaic sculpture===
[[File:KAMA Kouros Porte Sacrée.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Sacred Gate Kouros, marble (610–600 BC), [[Kerameikos|Kerameikos Archaeological Museum in Athens]]]]

[[Kouros]] (''male youth'') is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the [[archaic period in Greece]]. This type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of ''Apollo''.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Leonardos(1895). ''Archaelogiki Ephimeris'', Col 75, n 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lechat (1904). ''La sculpture Attic avant Phidias'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The first statues are certainly still and formal. The formality of their stance seems to be related with the [[Egypt]]ian precedent, but it was accepted for a good reason. The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness. When they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods.&lt;ref name="Bowra144"&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience'', pp. 144–152.&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time, is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions, and also due to the general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in ''ideal forms'' that can be imagined and represented.&lt;ref name=Carpenter55/&gt; These forms expressed immortality. Apollo was the immortal god of ''ideal balance and order''. His shrine in [[Delphi]], that he shared in winter with Dionysius had the inscriptions: {{lang|grc|γνῶθι σεαυτόν}} (gnōthi seautón="know thyself") and {{lang|grc|μηδὲν ἄγαν}} (''mēdén ágan'', "nothing in excess"), and {{lang|grc|ἐγγύα πάρα δ'ἄτη}} (eggýa pára d'atē, "make a pledge and mischief is nigh").&lt;ref&gt;See {{LSJ|a)/th|ἄτη|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WLA metmuseum Marble statue of a kouros youth 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|New York Kouros, Met. Mus. 32.11.1, marble (620–610 BC), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
In the first large-scale depictions during the early archaic period (640–580 BC), the artists tried to draw one's attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses, but as being full of life. The Greeks maintained, until late in their civilization, an almost [[animism|animistic]] idea that the statues are in some sense alive. This embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Bowra. ''The Greek experience'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; A fine example is the statue of the ''[[Sacred Gate]] Kouros'' which was found at the cemetery of [[Dipylon]] in Athens ([[Dipylon Kouros]]). The statue is the "thing in itself", and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity. According to the Greek tradition the [[Dipylon|Dipylon master]] was named [[Daedalus]], and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body, giving the impression that the statues could move. It is considered that he created also the ''New York kouros'', which is the oldest fully preserved statue of ''Kouros'' type, and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.&lt;ref name=Homann63/&gt;

[[File:7262 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - The Piraeus Apollo - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Piraeus Apollo]], archaic-style bronze, [[Archaeological Museum of Piraeus]]]]
The animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality, is sanctified in the [[Homeric]] poems and in Greek myths, in stories of the god [[Hephaestus]] ([[Phaistos]]) and the mythic [[Daedalus]] (the builder of the [[labyrinth]]) that made images which moved of their own accord. This kind of art goes back to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period, when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment.&lt;ref name="Schachermeyer242"&gt;F. Schachermeyer (1964). ''Die Minoische Kultur des alten Creta'', Kohlhammer Stuttgart, pp. 242–244.&lt;/ref&gt; These free-standing statues were usually marble, but also the form rendered in limestone, bronze, ivory and terracotta.

The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo, may be two figures from the [[Ionians|Ionic]] sanctuary on the island of [[Delos]]. Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of ''Apollo Ptoios'', [[Boeotia]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ducat (1971). ''Les Kouroi des Ptoion''.&lt;/ref&gt; The last stage in the development of the ''Kouros type'' is the late archaic period (520–485 BC), in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole. Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze [[Piraeus Apollo]]. It was found in [[Piraeus]], the harbour of Athens. The statue originally held the bow in its left hand, and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand. It probably comes from north-eastern [[Peloponnesus]]. The emphasis is given in anatomy, and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion, and beauty relative to proportions, which appear mostly in post-Archaic art. The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which, with an independently developed harder, simpler and heavier style, restricts [[Ionia]]n influence in Athens. Finally, this is the germ from which the art of [[Polykleitos]] was to grow two or three generations later.&lt;ref name="Homann144"&gt;Homann-Wedeking (1966). ''Art of the World. Archaic Greece'', pp. 144–150.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else, consisted of symmetry and proportions. The artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment ([[Myron]]), which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] element.&lt;ref name=Schachermeyer242/&gt; Anatomy and geometry are fused in one, and each does something to the other. The Greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions, just as they sought some reality behind appearances. [[Polykleitos]] in his ''Canon'' wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements (materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. It seems that he was influenced by the theories of [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;"Each part (finger, palm, arm, etc.) transmitted its individual existence to the next, and then to the whole" : ''Canon of [[Polykleitos]]'', also [[Plotinus]], ''Ennead'' I vi. i: Nigel Spivey (1997). ''Greek art'', Phaidon Press Ltd. London. pp. 290–294.&lt;/ref&gt;
The famous ''Apollo of Mantua'' and its variants are early forms of the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] statue type, in which the god holds the [[cithara]] in his left arm. The type is represented by [[neo-Attic]] Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of [[Polykleitos]] but more archaic. The Apollo held the ''cythara'' against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example, a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps.

Though the proportions were always important in Greek art, the appeal of the Greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone. The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period, and in the beliefs of the first [[Greek language|Greek]] speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age. Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art. Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form. Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same. Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self.&lt;ref name=Homann63/&gt; Things as we see them, and as they really are, are one, that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.

===Pediments and friezes===

[[File:Apollo west pediment Olympia copy MFA Munich.jpg|thumb|upright|Apollo, West Pediment Olympia. Munich, copy from original, 460 BCE at the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]], [[Olympia, Greece]].]]

In the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples, the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base.

The [[Siphnian Treasury]] in [[Delphi]] was one of the first Greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle, and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling. The pediment shows the story of [[Heracles]] stealing Apollo's tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration. Their two figures hold the centre. In the pediment of the temple of [[Zeus]] in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the single figure of Apollo is dominating the scene.&lt;ref name=Bowra144/&gt;

[[File:Belvedere Apollo Pio-Clementino Inv1015 n3.jpg|175px|thumb|Head of the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'']]

These representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake. They care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space, but only as parts in a larger whole. While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs. In these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals, to suggest a passage to and from a busy battlefield. The artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order, and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy.&lt;ref name=Bowra144/&gt;

===Hellenistic Greece-Rome===
Apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a [[kithara]] (as [[Apollo Citharoedus]]) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the [[Apollo Lykeios]] and [[Apollo Sauroctonos]] types). The [[Apollo Belvedere]] is a [[marble]] sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of [[Classical Antiquity]] for Europeans, from the [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century. The marble is a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor [[Leochares]], made between 350 and 325 BCE.

The life-size so-called "[[Adonis]]" found in 1780 on the site of a ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' near the [[Via Labicana]] in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars. In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from [[El Djem]], Roman ''Thysdrus'', he is identifiable as [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] by his effulgent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], though now even a god's divine [[nudity|nakedness]] is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later [[Roman Empire|Empire]].

Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=Mosaics in Tunisia: Apollo and the Muses |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=30 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708143541/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |archivedate=8 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Bieber 1964, Yalouris 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.

==Modern reception==
Apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature. [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] composed a "Hymn of Apollo" (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Apollon musagète]]'' (1927–1928). In 1978, the Canadian band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] released [[Hemispheres (Rush album)|an album]] with songs [[Cygnus X-1 Book II|"Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom"/"Dionysus: Bringer of Love"]].

In discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable. [[Carl Jung]]'s [[Apollo archetype]] represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance.

[[Charles Handy]], in ''Gods of Management'' (1978) uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of [[organizational culture|organisational culture]]. Apollo represents a 'role' culture where order, reason, and [[bureaucracy]] prevail.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Library]]: Management and Business Studies Portal, [https://mbsportal.bl.uk/taster/subjareas/busmanhist/mgmtthinkers/handy.aspx Charles Handy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112144123/https://mbsportal.bl.uk/taster/subjareas/busmanhist/mgmtthinkers/handy.aspx |date=12 November 2016 }}, accessed 12 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In spaceflight, the [[NASA]] program for landing astronauts on the Moon was named [[Apollo program|Apollo]].

The '''Architect of the Capitol''' ('''AOC''') is the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[Government agency|agency]] responsible for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the [[United States Capitol Complex]], and also the head of that agency.  The Architect of the Capitol is in the [[Legislature|legislative branch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoc.gov/doing-business-aoc/overview |title=Overview of Doing Business with AOC |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is accountable to the [[United States Congress]] and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The current Architect of the Capitol is [[Stephen T. Ayers]].  Ayers served as acting Architect of the Capitol since February 2007, and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on May 12, 2010, becoming the 11th Architect of the Capitol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoc.gov/aoc/press-room/Stephen-Ayers-confirmed-by-Senate.cfm |title=Stephen T.

==Overview==
The Architect of the Capitol sits on the [[Capitol Police Board]], which has jurisdiction over the United States Capitol Police, and on the [[United States Capitol Guide Board]], which has jurisdiction over the [[United States Capitol Guide Service]].

Until 1989, the position of Architect of the Capitol was filled by appointment from the [[President of the United States]] for an indefinite term. Legislation enacted in 1989 provides that the Architect is to be appointed for a term of ten years by the President, with the [[advice and consent]] of the Senate, from a list of three candidates recommended by a congressional commission. Upon confirmation by the Senate, the Architect becomes an official of the legislative branch as an officer and agent of Congress;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} he is eligible for reappointment after completion of his term.

'''Beverle Lorence''' "'''Bebe'''" '''Buell''' (born July 14, 1953) is an [[Americans|American]] singer and former fashion model, and ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's November 1974 [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Month]]. Buell moved to New York in 1971 after signing a modeling contract with [[Eileen Ford]], and garnered notoriety after her publicized relationship with musician [[Todd Rundgren]] from 1972 until 1979, as well as her liaisons with several [[rock music]]ians over the following four decades. She is the mother of actress [[Liv Tyler]], whose father is [[Aerosmith]] frontman [[Steven Tyler]]. Buell was involved with Rundgren when she had a fling with Tyler and gave birth to Liv in 1977; she then resumed her relationship with Rundgren.

In 2001, Buell wrote an autobiography (with [[Victor Bockris]]) titled ''Rebel Heart: An American Rock and Roll Journey''. The book was a ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller. The paperback was issued in 2002.

==Early life==
Buell was born in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]], the daughter of Dorothea (Brown) Johnson, who founded the Protocol School of Washington, and Harold Lloyd Buell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/21/fashion/21AGE.html | title = Manners in the Time of Flu | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = November 21, 2004 | first = Bob | last = Morris | accessdate = January 13, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130710220004/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/21/fashion/21AGE.html# | archive-date = 2013-07-10 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kz8hAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Dorothea+Johnson+grew+up+Dorothea+Brown+on+a+small+tobacco%22&amp;dq=%22Dorothea+Johnson+grew+up+Dorothea+Brown+on+a+small+tobacco%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4Bb5U8brN9ehyAT3_oIo&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA]&lt;/ref&gt; As her father was not at home at the time of Buell's birth, her mother waited until he got back before naming her daughter. The nurses in the hospital took to calling her "Baby Buell," which is where her nickname of "Bebe" originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buell|first1=Bebe|title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock and Roll Journey|date=2001|publisher=St. Martin's Press|pages=349|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is of [[German American|German]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://juicemagazine.com/home/bebe-buell/ Juice Magazine: "Bebe Buell - INTERVIEW BY STEVE OLSON"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142922/http://juicemagazine.com/home/bebe-buell/# |date=2018-06-12 }} September 2009 | ''Are you an American?

==Career==
===Modeling===
Buell was discovered by modeling agency executive [[Eileen Ford]] after high school graduation at age 17,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bebebuell.org/bios/about-bebe-buell/ |title=About |publisher=Bebe Buell |date= |accessdate=May 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234559/http://www.bebebuell.org/bios/about-bebe-buell/# |archive-date=2014-04-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and relocated to [[New York City]] at age 18.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt; She was ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Month]] for the November 1974 issue; her [[centerfold]] was photographed by [[Richard Fegley]]. In describing her early years and modeling career, Buell stated: "[I wanted] to be a professional singer [which was why] I came to New York— yes, I was a pretty young girl, so I fell into the modeling thing, and [then] I did ''Playboy'', so then the rock stars came-a-hunting, as I like to say."&lt;ref name="indie"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxoz1JgqEDk|work=YouTube|title=Indie Power TV: Interview with Bebe Buell|date=2014-09-03|accessdate=2015-09-18|location=Los Angeles, California|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316171941/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxoz1JgqEDk#|archive-date=2016-03-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
In 1981, Buell recorded a four-song EP on [[Rhino Records]], produced by [[Rick Derringer]] and [[Ric Ocasek]], with [[the Cars]] serving as her band on two tracks.&lt;ref name="Rebel"/&gt; The rock band [[The Power Station (band)|the Power Station]] began in 1984 when her then-boyfriend [[John Taylor (bass guitarist)|John Taylor]] (of [[Duran Duran]] fame) pulled some famous friends together to provide backing for another of Buell's musical efforts. She also formed the band the B-Sides in 1980 but they disbanded in 1985.

She founded another band called [[the Gargoyles]] in 1985, and released a couple of singles. A few large record companies were showing interest, but they disbanded when the paternity of her daughter Liv became publicly known in 1991. She withdrew from performing for six years in the 1990s. Buell managed her daughter Liv, helping to launch her career as a successful international model and actress. She also represented actress [[Charis Michelsen]].

After Buell's daughter left home in 1997, Buell returned to music to record a solo effort with producer [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]], released in 2000.  She also performed around New York with the Bebe Buell Band and, later, with Boston musicians [[the Rudds]] and [[the Neighborhoods]]' drummer Johnny Lynch to form a new band for a few shows which also included husband Jim Wallerstein.

She released her first recording in ten years with a single "Air Kisses for the Masses" in May 2009 and completed recording of a full-length 12-song album, set for late Fall 2009. It can be downloaded on iTunes or Amazon MP3.  Buell is playing a series of live shows in the [[New York City area]] to promote the single.

In September 2011, Buell released ''Hard Love'', an aggressive rock album influenced by [[grunge]] and [[glam rock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hard-love-mw0002210789|work=Allmusic|title=Hard Love - Bebe Buell|accessdate=2015-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318215545/http://www.allmusic.com/album/hard-love-mw0002210789#|archive-date=2016-03-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was produced by Bebe's husband [[James Wallerstein]] of the critically acclaimed proto-grunge band [[Das Damen]], and Stephen DeAcutis.  The 11-track record features original songs alongside covers of [[Gang of Four]]'s "I Love a Man in Uniform" and "Baby Baby" by the English punk rock band [[the Vibrators]].

==Personal life==
Buell has dated many musicians, beginning with Paul Cowsill of [[the Cowsills]] when she was 16.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gORJt0vP6z0C&amp;pg=PP1 p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; She has dated [[Mick Jagger]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[David Bowie]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Jimmy Page]], and [[Steven Tyler]], but she rejects the label "[[groupie]]".&lt;ref name=NYMAG152&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/bebe-buell-2011-10/ ''New York Magazine'': "152 Minutes With Bebe Buell - On a rock-and-roll photo tour with the legendary groupie, who prefers “rock girlfriend,” or now just “rocker.”" By Jada Yuan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117042607/http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/bebe-buell-2011-10/# |date=2013-11-17 }} September 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyTelegraph&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23789004-5009160,00.html |title=Tyler Liv's life to the full |last=Reinhart |first=Ernst |author2=Gillian Cumming |date=June 1, 2008 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]] |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130110100109/http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/insider/tyler-livs-life-to-the-full/story-e6frewt9-1111116499956# |archive-date=2013-01-10 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1972 to 1979, Bebe Buell had a longterm, on and off, relationship with [[Todd Rundgren]]. In 1976, Buell became unexpectedly pregnant from her brief relationship with [[Steven Tyler]]. On July 1, 1977, Buell gave birth to future actress/model [[Liv Tyler]], but Buell initially named her child ''Liv Rundgren'' and claimed that Todd Rundgren was the biological father to protect the child from Tyler's drug addiction. Rundgren and Buell ended their romantic relationship shortly after Liv's birth, but Rundgren put his heart and soul into the "white lie". At age nine, Liv found out that she was [[Steven Tyler]]'s biological daughter.&lt;ref name="People - Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/liv_tyler/biography|title=Liv Tyler Biography|accessdate=June 23, 2008|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530034516/http://www.people.com/people/liv_tyler/biography#|archive-date=2012-05-30|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hello - Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/livtyler/?|title=Hello Magazine Profile&amp;nbsp;— Liv Tyler|accessdate=June 23, 2008|publisher=Hello!

In 1992, Buell married for the first time. She wed sometime-musician and actor [[Coyote Shivers]].&lt;ref name=Rebel /&gt; They divorced in 1999 after a year-long separation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,216205,00.html Fox News: "'NCIS' Actress Pauley Perrette's Endless Nightmare Divorce" By Roger Friedman] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522072559/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,216205,00.html# |date=2013-05-22 }} September 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she married musician Jim Wallerstein&lt;ref name=NYMAG152 /&gt; (aka Jim Walters) of [[Das Damen]] and Vacationland fame.

For his film ''[[Almost Famous]]'', music journalist and filmmaker [[Cameron Crowe]] developed the groupie character Penny Lane as a composite of a handful of girls he saw backstage in the late 1960s and early 1970s at concerts calling themselves the "Flying Garter Girls". One girl who went by the nickname Pennie Lane is real-life [[Pennie Lane Trumbull]], born in [[Portland, Oregon]], in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://oregonmusicnews.com/2012/09/07/will-the-real-penny-lane-please-stand-up/ |title=Will the real Penny Lane please stand up? |date=September 7, 2012 |last=Ammann |first=Ana |work=Oregon Music News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907213033/http://oregonmusicnews.com/2012/09/07/will-the-real-penny-lane-please-stand-up/ |archivedate=September 7, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they were not in the Flying Garter Girls group, various other women have been described as Crowe's inspiration, for instance [[Pamela Des Barres]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2010/12/15/zooey-deschanel-to-play-original-60s-groupie-pamela-im-with-the-band-des-barres-in-hbo-series-nsfw |title=Zooey Deschanel to Play Original '60s Groupie Pamela "I'm With the Band" Des Barres in HBO Series (NSFW) |last=Lecaro |first=Lina |date=December 15, 2010 |work=LA Weekly |access-date=2015-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105113512/http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2010/12/15/zooey-deschanel-to-play-original-60s-groupie-pamela-im-with-the-band-des-barres-in-hbo-series-nsfw# |archive-date=2015-01-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Buell. Buell partially inspired Crowe; he named a lead singer character Jeff Bebe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Talk |title=Wild Things: Cameron Crowe and Bebe Buell |date=March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buell lived in New York and [[New Jersey]]&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; before relocating to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nashvillearts.com/2014/10/31/bebe-buell/|work=Nashville Arts|title=Q&amp;A: Bebe Buell|author= Polycarpou, Paul|accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox Korean name|hangul=부여태|hanja=扶餘泰|rr=Buyeo Tae|mr=Puyŏ Tae}}

'''Buyeo Tae''' (扶餘泰, ? – ?) was a prince of [[Baekje]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. He was the second son of the last king, [[Uija of Baekje]]. When [[Sabi (Korea)|Sabi]], the capital fell to the [[Silla-Tang alliance]] in 660 he fled to [[Ungjin]] with his mother the queen. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Samguk Sagi | language = Korean | url = http://www.koreandb.net/sam/bon/samkuk/04_280_2001521.htm | quote = 王子扶餘豊 嘗質於倭國者 立之爲王 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000151/http://www.koreandb.net/sam/bon/samkuk/04_280_2001521.htm | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They went to Busosanseong (Busosan Fortress) where they held out for a short time but there were many that knew that could not withstand the forces of the Silla-Tang alliance and a certain soldier opened up the gate and surrendered to fortress. After this he was taken to [[Luoyang]] in China where he disappears from history.

His younger brother, Zenkō (善光 or 禅広), settled in Japan and was given the family name [[Kudara no Konikishi]] (百濟王; king of Baekje) by the emperor of Japan.

== History with DEF CON ==
At DEF CON 17 Hadnagy was approached to help start a Social Engineering contest for the [[DEF CON|popular hacking conference]], [[DEF CON]].
[[File:SECTF-GenAlexanderandChrisHadnagy.png|thumb|General Keith Alexander offers Chris Hadnagy the NSA Director’s Challenge Coin at DEF CON 20.]]

Hadnagy founded the Social Engineering Capture the Flag (SECTF&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.social-engineer.org/category/ctf/|title=CTF Archives - Security Through Education|website=Security Through Education|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) competition. Ethical conduct is strictly enforced and personal/financial information is not allowed to be targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social-Engineer.Org CTF Update – Awareness Abounds|url=http://www.social-engineer.org/social-engineering/social-engineer-org-ctf-update-awareness-abounds/|website=Security through Education|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Businesses and government agencies initially raised concern regarding the type of information that would be gathered and the methods that would be employed to collect it, however, after four years this has diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jackson Higgins, K.|title=Defcon To Host 'Capture The Flag' Social Engineering Contest No unethical activities or 'damage' to targeted companies or people allowed|url=http://www.darkreading.com/risk/defcon-to-host-capture-the-flag-social-engineering-contest/d/d-id/1133739?|website=InformationWeek: DARKreading|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contest is broken down into two sections: first, information gathering and planning attack vectors in the month before DEF CON and second, a public execution of a [[vishing]] attack in the SEVillage at DEF CON.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Social Engineering CTF – How Strong is Your Schmooze |url=http://www.social-engineer.org/social-engineering/the-social-engineering-ctf-how-strong-is-your-schmooze/#sthash.iNdpW2hC.dpuf|website=Security through Education|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A competition report is released each year which many businesses utilize to help improve their security awareness programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.social-engineer.org/?s=SECTF+Report|title=You searched for SECTF Report - Security Through Education|website=Security Through Education|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SECTF has also researched and reported on the topics of gender in the SE field,  which industries are most susceptible to SE attacks, and improvements that have been seen in companies successfully targeted in previous years.

At DEF CON 18 Hadnagy and crew launched the first SECTF and became the first contest to receive a black badge its first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.social-engineer.org/social-engineering/social-engineer-breaks-a-defcon-record/|title=Social-Engineer Breaks a Defcon Record - Security Through Education|date=2010-08-04|newspaper=Security Through Education|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year the contest has grown in popularity and size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Mrs.|title=Social engineer tag teams to capture the flags at Def Con 22 contest|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2226683/microsoft-subnet/social-engineer-tag-teams-to-capture-the-flags-at-def-con-22-contest.html|website=NetworkWorld|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hadnagy developed SECTF4Kids for DEF CON 19 with the stated intention of teaching younger generations social engineering skills &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What the SECTF4Kids is All About|url=http://www.social-engineer.org/general-blog/sectf4kids/|website=Security through Education|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the SECTF4Kids was made an official DEF CON event rather than one of the kids' events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kids To Hack Corporate Crime Caper Case At DEF CON|url=http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/kids-to-hack-corporate-crime-caper-case-at-def-con/d/d-id/1269662|website=InformationWeekly: DARKreading|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clifford Albert Lincoln''' (born September 1, 1928) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician who served as a member of the [[Quebec National Assembly]], a provincial [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] minister and a member of  the [[House of Commons of Canada]].

Lincoln was born in [[Mauritius]] to Francis Lincoln, a British colonial civil servant, and Régina De Baize.  He studied [[insurance]] in Mauritius and in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].  He emigrated to [[Canada]] in 1958, settling first in [[Vancouver]] and then in [[Montreal]], where he became an insurance company executive.

He was first elected to the [[Quebec National Assembly]] in [[Quebec general election, 1981|1981]] as a member of the [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal Party]].  When the Liberals formed government in [[Quebec general election, 1985|1985]], Lincoln was appointed Minister of the Environment by Premier [[Robert Bourassa]].

Lincoln and two other [[English-speaking Quebecker|anglophone]] ministers resigned from cabinet in 1989, to protest the Bourassa government's language policy and its adoption of Bill 178,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/docs/bill178/10-33.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119132110/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/docs/bill178/10-33.htm |archivedate=2005-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which invoked the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] of the [[Canadian Constitution]]  to require French to be the dominant language on commercial signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/docs/bill178/1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119094915/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/docs/bill178/1.htm |archivedate=2005-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He campaigned for the leadership of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1990|1990]].  At the same time, he contested a by-election in the federal electoral district of [[Chambly (electoral district)|Chambly]].  He lost the by-election to [[Phil Edmonston]] of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] and then withdrew from the Liberal leadership contest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/HFER/hfer.asp?Language=E&amp;Search=Det&amp;Include=Y&amp;rid=128&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to Parliament in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]] in the district of [[Lachine—Lac-Saint-Louis]] and was re-elected in [[Lac-Saint-Louis (electoral district)|Lac-Saint-Louis]] in [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997]] and [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000]].  He served as [[parliamentary secretary]] to the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] and the [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]] from 1993 until 1996.  He also served as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage from 1997 until 2004.  As such he wrote a report on Canadian broadcasting, ''Our Cultural Sovereignty: The Second Century of Canadian Broadcasting''; its recommendations were largely ignored by the government.

Lincoln retired from politics at the [[Canadian general election, 2004|2004 federal election]] and was appointed Chairman of the Panel on Access to Third-language Public Television Services&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p2/2004/2004-08-25/pdf/g2-13817.pdf Canada Gazette Part II, Vol. 138, No. 17] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306221529/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p2/2004/2004-08-25/pdf/g2-13817.pdf |date=2012-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the federal government.

As of 2007, Lincoln is President of the Board of Directors of the [[English Speaking Catholic Council]] of [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=d75dd549-6b6d-4f18-915f-c162ebf4ed05 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103131344/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=d75dd549-6b6d-4f18-915f-c162ebf4ed05 |archivedate=2012-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2012, he released ''[http://shorelinepress.ca/?portfolio=toward-new-horizons Toward New Horizons]'', a memoir of his life in politics.

'''Colard Mansion''' (or '''Colart''', before 1440 &amp;ndash; after May 1484) was a 15th-century [[Flanders|Flemish]] scribe and printer who worked together with [[William Caxton]]. He is known as the first printer of a book with copper [[engraving]]s, and as the printer of the first books in English and French.

==Biography==
Colard Mansion was a central figure in the early printing industry in [[Bruges]]. He was active as early as 1454 as a bookseller, and was also active as a [[scribe]], translator and contractor for [[manuscript]]s, which meant entering into contracts with the clients, and organizing and sub-contracting the elements such as scribing, decorating and binding.&lt;ref&gt;Such a contract is described on p. 59 of T Kren &amp; S McKendrick (eds), ''Illuminating the Renaissance: The Triumph of Flemish Manuscript Painting in Europe'', Getty Museum/Royal Academy of Arts, 2003, {{ISBN|1-903973-28-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1474 until 1476 he worked together with the early English printer [[William Caxton]], and he continued the company on his own afterwards. Caxton probably learned the art of printing from Mansion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22176 British History Online]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was from Mansion's press that the first books printed in English (''[[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye]]'') and French came.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutbookbinding.com/story/29.html The Story of Books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816234843/http://www.aboutbookbinding.com/story/29.html |date=2007-08-16 }} by Gertrude Burford Rawlings, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to the Burg, the commercial heart of Bruges at the time, in 1478. Mansion suffered heavily under the economic crisis in Bruges in the 1480s, and only one work was printed after the death of [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1482. Nothing is known with certainty about his life after 1484, although he may have moved to [[Picardy]].

==Work==
Mansion sold [[illuminated manuscript]]s to the aristocracy, and luxurious [[incunabulum|incunabula]] to the [[bourgeoisie]], but he was one of the first to also publish smaller and cheaper books of only twenty to thirty pages, mainly in French. Nowadays, 25 editions of incunabula by Mansion alone are known, making him the most prolific of Bruges' early printers. Only two of these are in Latin, all others are in French, many of them first editions. Customers of Mansion include [[Charles de Croÿ, prince of Chimay]], and Marie, the widow of [[Louis de Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol]]. Mansion has been called the first printer of luxury books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?articleID=g3kb55g8 Drukkunst bezorgde Brugge internationale faam] [[Het Nieuwsblad]], 2004-12-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

He collaborated with major manuscript illuminators, such as the [[Master of the Dresden Prayer Book]], who were fast losing work to printing, or copyists of their work.  In fact only two of his books are illustrated, the influential ''Ovide Moralisé'' with [[woodcut]]s, and a French translation of [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'', the first book to be illustrated with [[engraving]]s, some of which have been claimed to be the work of the Dresden Prayer Book Master and other identified illuminators in the circle of the [[Master of Anthony of Burgundy]].  As [[Intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]] prints, the nine engravings had to be printed separately from the relief text and then pasted in, and only three copies are known with the engravings.  More copies are known without the engravings, several of which contain illuminations instead.  It has been suggested that this was Mansion's original intention (other incunabula left spaces for manual illustration), but that this hybrid product did not attract the wealthy buyers of illuminations, so the engravings were an afterthought, aimed at a less exclusive market.&lt;ref&gt;Copies with engravings are in Amiens, Boston MFA &amp; Getty private Collection, England.  T Kren &amp; S McKendrick (eds), ''Illuminating the Renaissance: The Triumph of Flemish Manuscript Painting in Europe'', pp. 271-4, Getty Museum/Royal Academy of Arts, 2003, {{ISBN|1-903973-28-7}}, see also ''An Introduction to a History of Woodcut'', Arthur M. Hind, p. 592, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mansion is also known as the translator of at least five texts from Latin to French, including ''Le dialogue des créatures'', printed by Dutch [[Gerard Leeu]] in 1482.

This book was reprinted as the ''Bible des poëtes'' (Poets' Bible) at least four times in Paris between 1493 and 1531. Afterwards, a purer version (with all allegorical additions by Mansion removed, but keeping his translations) under the title ''Grand Olympe des histoires poëtiques du Prince de poësie Ovide Naso en sa Metamorphose''  was published repeatedly between 1532 and 1570.

'''Deng Thiak Adut''' is a [[defence lawyer]] and refugee advocate in [[Western Sydney]], [[Australia]], and a former [[Military use of children|child soldier]] from [[South Sudan]]. His story is told in a popular short video by [[Western Sydney University]], where he earned his law degree. He was named the 2017 New South Wales Australian of the Year.

== Early life ==
A member of the [[Dinka people]], Adut was born near Malek, a small fishing village in South Sudan near [[White Nile River]].&lt;ref name=Songs/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name=SMHT/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeadofNight/&gt; One of eight children,&lt;ref name=SMHT/&gt; he had a happy early childhood spent with his family at their banana farm.&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt;

In 1987 at the age of 6 or 7 years,{{refn|group=note|6 according to various news sources&lt;ref name=SMHT/&gt;&lt;ref name=UWS/&gt; or 7 according to Adut's autobiography&lt;ref name=Songs/&gt;{{rp|12}}}} Adut was taken from his mother and marched for 33 days to [[Ethiopia]] along with 30 other child conscripts.&lt;ref name=DeadofNight/&gt; During the march, some boys died of starvation or thirst, others were shot by bandits, and others attacked by wild animals.&lt;ref name=DeadofNight/&gt; The boys were forced to fight for the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] in the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]].&lt;ref name=SMHT/&gt;&lt;ref name=UWS/&gt;  They were [[Mind control|brainwashed]] and given daily doses of [[khat]], a herbal [[stimulant]] drug popular in East Africa.&lt;ref name=DeadofNight/&gt; Adut was taught to use an [[AK-47]] assault rifle and other weapons.  He witnessed many atrocities, including people dying from dehydration and a [[grenade]] explosion and children committing suicide.&lt;ref name=Sales/&gt;&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMHT/&gt; At 12 years of age he was shot in the testicles and back and almost bled to death.&lt;ref name=Sales/&gt;&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeadofNight/&gt;

In 1995, Adut's older half-brother, John Mac, smuggled Adut out of Sudan at night in a truck under sacks of corn.&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Austn/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeadofNight/&gt;  Adut spent 18 months in a refugee camp in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name=Austn/&gt; The United Nations granted both brothers [[refugee]] status,&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt; and in 1998 when Adut was 14, Australia granted both boys a [[Travel visa|visa]].&lt;ref name=Austn/&gt;

== In Australia ==
Adut reached Australia in 1998 at age 14 due to sponsorship by Christian aid workers Bob and Christine Harrison.&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeadofNight/&gt; He was part of the third family to come to Australia as Sudanese refugees.&lt;ref name=Neptune/&gt; He had little education and did not know English,&lt;ref name=Teleg/&gt; and initially felt isolated as a member of the only black family in [[Blacktown]], [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt;  At 15 Adut taught himself English, in part by using ''[[The Wiggles]]'' children's television program and the Bible as examples, though Adut is an avowed atheist.&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Neptune/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeadofNight/&gt; He worked myriad part-time jobs including making concrete, carpet, windows and doors, catching chickens, working in a meat factory, working in a petrol station, and mowing lawns.&lt;ref name=Sales/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMHT/&gt; He became an Australian citizen in 2001.&lt;ref name=DeadofNight/&gt;

In 2001, Adut completed a [[TAFE]] course equivalent to a high school certificate.&lt;ref name=Songs/&gt;{{rp|74}} Subsequently he completed an Advanced Diploma in Accounting at TAFE.&lt;ref name=UWS/&gt; He rejected an offer to study at [[Macquarie University]] following [[Drew Fraser#Non-white immigration and multiculturalism|racist remarks]] by Macquarie law professor [[Drew Fraser]],&lt;ref name=Songs/&gt;{{rp|82}} instead accepting admission to [[Western Sydney University]] on a scholarship. The first in his family to earn a university degree, Adut graduated with a [[Bachelor of Laws]],&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt;  and worked for Grace Legal and then LN Legal.&lt;ref name=Songs/&gt;{{rp|87,91}}  Along with solicitor Joseph Correy, Adut co-founded AC Law Group and is still a partner,&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt;&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt; supporting youths of Western Sydney's Sudanese community as a [[defence lawyer]].&lt;ref name=Teleg/&gt;&lt;ref name=AusDay/&gt; He performs much of his work ''[[pro bono]]''.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Songs/&gt;{{rp|89}}&lt;ref name=DeadofNight/&gt;

Adut founded the John Mac Foundation in honour of his half-brother, John Mac Acuek, who helped Adut escape South Sudan and died in 2014 while leading an effort to rescue South Sudanese civilians from ongoing conflict.&lt;ref name=JohnMac/&gt;  The Foundation provides higher education scholarships to students from refugee backgrounds.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt;  Adut sponsors "Savannah Pride", a Blacktown basketball team.&lt;ref name=Austn/&gt;

In 2017 Adut condemned the [[Executive Order 13769|ban on immigration to the United States]] ordered by US President Donald Trump.  He said, "The culture of punishing the innocent and weak countries has got to stop. It's not stopping wars; it's creating them. It's creating economic deprivation for the local people; the victims are the poor, the ones that have no skills, the refugees."&lt;ref name=9News/&gt;

Adut completed a [[Master of Laws]] in Criminal Prosecution at [[Wollongong University]]&lt;ref name=Songs/&gt;{{rp|137}} and has a scholarship to return to Western Sydney University for a second Master of Laws in International Governance.&lt;ref name=DeadofNight/&gt; He ultimately aims to return to South Sudan to prosecute those responsible for the conscription of child soldiers.&lt;ref name=LawSoc/&gt;

== Recognition ==

In 2015 Western Sydney University produced a short video about Adut's life up to his 2012 reunion with his mother, who was still living in Adut's childhood home in South Sudan.&lt;ref name=UWS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sales/&gt;  Viewed over 2 million times on YouTube,&lt;ref name=Songs/&gt;{{rp|140}} Adut says it "has helped others understand the horrors that see people seek asylum in safer countries", and helped him promote the importance of education.&lt;ref name=Songs/&gt;{{rp|140}}

On 27 October 2016 Adut was awarded the 2016 [[NSW Law Society|Law Society of New South Wales]] President's Medal. Society president Gary Ulman said the award is "testament to [Adut's] personal and professional achievements over a number of years, and to his outstanding contribution to the community of Western Sydney."&lt;ref name=LawSoc/&gt;

Also in 2016 Adut was named New South Wales Australian of the Year for 2017.  The announcement was made by the state Premier [[Mike Baird]], who said Adut "has channelled his success into helping hundreds of people in the state's Sudanese community navigate their way through the Australian legal system."&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt;

An acrylic and oil on linen portrait of Adut titled ''Deng'' by artist Nick Stathopoulos won the People's Choice Award in the 2016 Archibald Prize at the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=Archibald/&gt;

}}

'''Cheryl Grimmer''' (born 1966) was a three-year-old toddler who went missing on 12 January 1970 from a [[Wollongong]] beach, in [[Illawarra]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. She had been in the shower block at the beach when witnesses claim a man took her and ran off.

Grimmer's disappearance has been without explanation for over 45 years. A suspect was arrested and charged in March 2017.&lt;ref name="breakthrough" /&gt;

==Life==
The family emigrated from [[Knowle, Bristol|Knowle]], a suburb of [[Bristol]], England to Australia in 1969&lt;ref name=":BP:"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grimshaw|first1=Emma|title=Killer of three-year-old Bristol girl snatched from an Australian beach could soon be discovered|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/murderer-of-three-year-old-bristol-girl-snatched-from-an-australian-beach-could-soon-be-discovered/story-29966436-detail/story.html|accessdate=12 December 2016|work=Bristol Post|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Cheryl was two years old and they were living in a hostel near to the beach where she disappeared.&lt;ref name=":TDT:"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morri|first1=Mark|title=Cheryl Grimmer disappearance: Cops close in on little girl’s killer 47 years later|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/cheryl-grimmer-disapearance-cops-close-in-on-little-girls-killer-47-years-later/news-story/79060c709bd34593d7c1f0fdd4473459|accessdate=12 December 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was mother Carole (26), father John (24) and sons Ricki (7), Stephen (5) and Paul (4). Cheryl was the Grimmers' only daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The disappearance of Cheryl Grimmer|url=https://forgottenillawarra.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/the-disappearance-of-cheryl-grimmer/|website=forgottenillawarra.wordpress.com|publisher=forgotten illawarra|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On the morning of 12 January 1970, the Grimmer family went to the beach at Fairy Meadow in Illawarra except for John Grimmer who was away working as a sapper for the Australian Army.&lt;ref name=":IM1:"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mardon|first1=Cydonee|title=Heartache endures for lost little girl Cheryl Grimmer|url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/2442566/heartache-endures-for-lost-little-girl-cheryl-grimmer-photos-video/|accessdate=12 December 2016|work=Illawarra Mercury|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the weather turned at 1:30&amp;nbsp;pm, Carole Grimmer decided it was time to go home.&lt;ref name=":TDT:" /&gt; The children all went to the shower block together whilst Carole Grimmer packed up their belongings. Ricki went back to Carole Grimmer ten minutes later saying that Cheryl was refusing to come out of the shower block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buckingham-Jones|first1=Sam|title=Cheryl Grimmer: breakthrough in cold case abduction|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/cheryl-grimmer-breakthrough-in-cold-case-abduction/news-story/dc25ad0c6291ed89bae150bbd8d6be9e|accessdate=8 December 2016|work=The Australian|date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She followed Ricki back to the shower block moments later only to find that Cheryl had disappeared. There has been no trace of her since.&lt;ref name=":TDT:" /&gt;

==Theories==
At the time, witnesses claimed that a man was seen holding Cheryl up to drink from a water fountain and then ran off with her wrapped up in a towel. She was also spotted being driven off in a white car.&lt;ref name=":TDT:" /&gt;

New South Wales Police Minister Michael Gallagher said that it is entirely possible that both Cheryl and her kidnapper were dead but that someone may know the truth. He also alluded to the possibility of someone being alive today suspecting that they may be Cheryl.&lt;ref name=":TA:" /&gt; One reason for this is that Cheryl had a medical condition that made her belly button protrude outwards by {{convert|10|mm}} and this would be easily identifiable if that person were alive today or if they had surgery to correct this.&lt;ref name=":IM2:" /&gt; In 2012 a woman thought that she might be Cheryl. She submitted a DNA swab taken from her inside cheek, but this proved to not be a match for Cheryl Grimmer's DNA.&lt;ref name=":JF:" /&gt;

==Investigation==
Her disappearance sparked a massive manhunt and three days later, police received a note demanding $10,000 and saying that the child was unharmed. The police staged a drop for the money in [[Bulli, New South Wales|Bulli]],&lt;ref name=":IM1:" /&gt; but the kidnapper never showed despite police earnestly believing the note was credible. The police disguised themselves as council workers for the ransom drop,&lt;ref name=":BP:" /&gt; but they fear this led to the kidnapper being spooked and that the large police operation may have also deterred the kidnapper from coming forward to claim their ransom.&lt;ref name=":TA:"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reward for clues in 1970 child kidnap|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/reward-for-clues-in-1970-child-kidnap/news-story/656c99171ddd6367164cf8bb64e3a41b|accessdate=12 December 2016|work=The Australian|date=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case became famous in Australia and the family relocated back to England for ten years afterwards to escape the notoriety.&lt;ref name=":IM2:"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoctor|first1=Michelle|title=41 years on, family hunts for clues on Cheryl Grimmer disappearance|url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/635704/41-years-on-family-hunts-for-clues-on-cheryl-grimmer-disappearance/|accessdate=12 December 2016|work=Illawarra Mercury|date=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A local man confessed to killing Cheryl, but police investigations revealed that his confession was false.&lt;ref name=":JF:"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=Stacey|title=The day my baby sister disappeared|url=http://justineford.net/wp-content/uploads/SNATCHED.pdf|website=justineford.net|accessdate=12 December 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

In May 2011, a coroner ruled that Cheryl had died sometime after going missing due to an undetermined cause, but Carole Grimmer stated that she believed her daughter was still alive. Both Carole and John Grimmer have since died without knowing what happened to Cheryl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Breakthrough in 46-year mystery of missing toddler|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38219550|accessdate=12 December 2016|work=BBC News|date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the coroner's ruling, police posted a $100,000 reward for information regarding Cheryl's disappearance.&lt;ref name=":TA:" /&gt; In 2016, a review of the evidence was carried out and all of the evidence and witness statements were computerised for the first time. The review threw up many leads and information that was not pursued thoroughly enough in 1970. Wollongong detectives and the Homicide Squad's Unsolved Homicide Team combined efforts into a new task force called 'Strike Force Wessell'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Angela|title=Illawarra toddler Cheryl Grimmer's kidnapper and suspected killer still alive: police|url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/4334478/cold-case-breakthrough-cheryls-killer-still-alive-police-say/|accessdate=12 December 2016|work=Illawarra Mercury|date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police announced in December 2016 that they had a credible lead on a man who was seen carrying a fair-haired child at the time of Cheryl's disappearance from the beach. Police said that he was a teenager at the time, so would be in his 60s now, and appealed for him to come forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheryl Grimmer case: police reportedly identify suspect 50 years after toddler's abduction|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/05/cheryl-grimmer-case-police-reportedly-identify-suspect-50-years-after-toddlers-abduction|accessdate=8 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2017, it was announced that a man had been arrested and charged with Grimmer's abduction and murder. Police stated that it is unlikely that Cheryl's body will ever be found as there has been substantial development of the once-rural area in the 47 years since the abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2016/s4641198.htm|title=Man arrested 47 years after disappearance of 3-year-old Cheryl Grimmer|work=ABC News Sydney|date=23 March 2017|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="breakthrough"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchell|first1=Georgina|title=Breakthrough in toddler Cheryl Grimmer 1970 cold case murder as man arrested|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/cheryl-grimmer-man-arrested-over-1970-cold-case-murder-of-illawarra-toddler-20170322-gv4aij.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=23 March 2017|date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, NSW police stated that they were trying to trace a family who gave a witness statement on the day of the abduction. The family moved soon after to [[Papua New Guinea]] and then back to their native [[Nottinghamshire]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheryl Grimmer: UK family sought over 1970 toddler death|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-39586512|accessdate=13 April 2017|work=BBC News|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpol helped to trace the witness, now 80-years old, whose testimony is expected to be crucial in the upcoming court case.&lt;ref name=":TT27:"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lagan|first1=Bernard|title=British man key to solving 47-year-old Australian abduction|work=The Times|issue=72234|date=27 May 2017|page=23|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, it was revealed that the suspect who was arrested in March 2017 had confessed to Cheryl's abduction and murder back in 1970. However, police at the time did not believe him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheryl Grimmer: Accused man gave evidence in 1971, court hears|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-40024825|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=BBC News|date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accused is a 63-year-old man who was born in Britain and has been in Australia since the late 1960s. He has not been named, as he was 16-years-old at the time of the alleged offence and therefore a minor.&lt;ref name=":TT26:"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lagan|first1=Bernard|title=Toddler's 'killer' confessed to police five decades ago|work=The Times|issue=72233|date=26 May 2017|page=15|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Édgar Chamorro Coronel''' (born 23 July 1931) is an ousted leader of the [[Nicaragua]]n rebel [[Contras]] who later became a critic of the rebels and their [[Central Intelligence Agency]] sponsors, even cooperating with the Sandinista government in their World Court case, ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]''. He is a member of the prominent [[Chamorro (family)|Chamorro family]] that provided five of Nicaragua's past presidents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/470&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Edgar Chamorro is the son of Julio Chamorro Benard and wife Dolores "Lola" Coronel Urtecho, paternal grandson of Filadelfo Chamorro Bolaños and wife Bertha Benard Vivas and great-grandson of [[Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Alfaro|Pedro Joaquín Chamorro y Alfaro]], 39th President of Nicaragua, and wife María de la Luz Bolaños Bendaña. He has six brothers and four sisters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Fallece doña Lola Coronel de Chamorro |url=http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2006/06/17/nacionales/22030 |format= |work= |publisher=[[El Nuevo Diario]] |location=Managua, Nicaragua |id= |page= |date=17 June 2006 |accessdate=25 May 2008 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728230924/http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2006/06/17/nacionales/22030 |archivedate=28 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the nephew of intellectual [[José Coronel Urtecho]]. In 1950, 19-year-old Chamorro began studying for the [[Jesuit]] priesthood, earning degrees from Ecuador's [[Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador|Catholic University]], [[Saint Louis University]], and [[Marquette University]]. Chamorro joined the faculty of the Jesuit-run [[University of Central America (Managua)|University of Central America]], before leaving the priesthood in 1969. He got another degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1972 and founded a public relations and marketing firm, Creative Publicity, in [[Managua]]. In 1977, [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] appointed him to a figurehead post as a special ambassador to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] for a year.

==Activities during Nicaraguan civil war==
During the [[Sandinista]] Revolution, Chamorro sympathized with the rebels, at one point hiding [[Sergio Ramírez]] from the [[National Guard (Nicaragua)|National Guard]]. But as the civil war's climax brought fierce fighting to the capital itself, fears for his family's safety led him to leave for [[Miami, Florida]] on June 17, 1979. Somoza fell a month later, but after visiting Nicaragua in September, Chamorro decided to remain in Miami.

By late 1979, Chamorro had become involved in the anti-Sandinista activities of the Miami exile community. He joined the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Union]] (UDN), formed the next year by [[José Francisco Cardenal]], which merged into the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (FDN) in August 1981. He served on the FDN's political executive committee, which decided to replace Cardenal with a new political directorate. Chamorro was tapped to be a member of the directorate, unveiled at a December 8, 1982 press conference. With his public relations experience, he took on a spokesman role for the FDN, and based himself in [[Tegucigalpa]], Honduras to liaison with journalists covering the war. Chamorro claimed that the [[CIA]] prepped him before press conferences and told him to deny that the group had received any funding from the US government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Gary|year=1999|pp=74|title=[[Dark Alliance]]|publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|isbn=978-1-888363-93-7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chamorro was miffed when the FDN directorate, at the CIA's prompting, appointed [[Adolfo Calero]] as its president in October 1983. His not-so-private grumblings that his Chamorro lineage was more illustrious than Calero's did not help their deteriorating relations.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Garvin, ''Everybody Had His Own Gringo: The CIA and the Contras'', Brassey's (US), 1992, p. 132, {{ISBN|0-08-040562-2}}; Cruz, Arturo Jr., ''Memoirs of a Counter-Revolutionary: Life With the Contras, the Sandinistas, and the CIA'', Doubleday, 1989, p. 176, {{ISBN|0-385-24879-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chamorro was forced out in November 1984, in the fallout from the furor over the CIA's ''[[Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare]]'', labeled by the press a "murder manual." He turned against the rebel movement, even submitting an affidavit for the Sandinista government before the [[International Court of Justice]] in ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">'''Francita Alavez''' (c. 1816 &amp;ndash; c. 1906) was known as the "Angel of Goliad," for saving the lives of Texas prisoners of war in the "Goliad Massacre" and at Copano and Victoria, Texas, by interceding on their behalf and persuading the help of Mexican officials.

==Early life==
Francita's definite date and town of birth are not known. Even her real name has been referred to differently at times, such as '''Panchita''', '''Francisca''', '''Pancheta''', or '''Francita''', and her surname as '''Alevesco''', '''Alvárez''', or '''Alavez'''.

==Texas revolution==
During the [[Texas Revolution]], she did travel to Texas in 1836, as a companion of Captain Telesforo Alavez, who had sailed to Texas from [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], Mexico to El Cópano port at Copano Bay, Texas.

==An Angel of mercy==
{{further|Goliad Campaign}}
At [[Copano, Texas|El Cópano]], she combined her compassion for humanity with her strong willed personality to influence important Mexican officials  to treat the Texian prisoners humanely. When 80 soldiers of Major William Parsons Miller and the Nashville Battalion were captured by Urrea's soldiers, she influenced the Mexican soldiers to untie the men's hands and to give them something to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=George O. |last=Coalson |title=Alavez, Francita |work=Handbook of Texas Online |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal53 |accessdate=June 19, 2011 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In La Bahia [[Goliad, Texas|(Goliad)]], due to the intervention of this [[Angel of Goliad]] and the courageous effort of Colonel Francisco Garay, 20 more men were held and spared as doctors, interpreters, or workers.&lt;ref name=hardin237&gt;Hardin (1994), pg. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Francita entered the presidio the night before the massacre, bringing several men out with her and hiding them until after the [[Goliad Massacre]]. She also made sure the 80 men from Miller's Natchez group were not executed.

In [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]], where her husband was left in charge, she saw to it that the 26 [[Texian]] boat builders and workers there would be released and not executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig H. |last=Roell |title=Georgia Battalion |work=Handbook of Texas Online |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qjg01 |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the defeat of Santa Anna, Francita returned with Captain Alavez to [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]]. At the prison in Matamoros, she continued to support the Texians imprisoned there. When Captain Alavez left for Mexico City, Francita went with him. But their relationship soon ended. She then left Mexico City and returned to Matamoros. While broke and down on her luck, she was befriended by Texians who knew of her humanitarian acts. The 1936 memoirs of Elena O'Shea, a King Ranch schoolteacher, claim that Francita Alavez traveled back to Texas with her new friends, where she was employed to work on the ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=TAMU |title=Goliad Angel |url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/goliadangel.htm |work=Sons of DeWitt Colony Texas |first=Wallace L. |last=McKeehan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis "Frank" Potenza''' (November 11, 1933 – August 23, 2011) was an American [[police officer]] for the [[New York City Police Department]] and [[security guard]]. He later became a [[television actor]] for the [[Late-night talk show|late night show]], ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. He appeared as [[Jimmy Kimmel]]'s "Uncle Frank" on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show as a regular from 2003 until his death in 2011.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Passings: Frank Potenza, John Howard Davies, Jack Layton|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/24/local/la-me-passings-20110824 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2011-08-24|accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nydailynews&gt;{{cite news|first=Nancy|last=Dillon|title=Frank Potenza, 'Uncle Frank' on nephew Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show, dead at 77|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-08-23/entertainment/29939634_1_abc-s-jimmy-kimmel-live-frank-sinatra-nephew|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=2011-08-23|accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Carter|title=Frank Potenza, Foil for Kimmel, Is Dead at 77|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/arts/television/frank-potenza-foil-for-nephew-jimmy-kimmel-dies-at-77.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=2011-08-26|accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Francis Potenza was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York in 1933.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He served in the [[United States army]] during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Potenza joined the [[New York Police Department]] (NYPD) following the war, serving as a [[Beat (police)|beat cop]] in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn]] in the 62nd Precinct for 20 years.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nydailynews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/6697716/NYPD-62nd-Precinct|title=NYPD 62nd Precinct - New York City, New York|work=wikimapia.org|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly made just six arrests during his two decades in the NYPD, believing that a lecture by the police delivered more benefits than a prison sentence.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

He became a [[security guard]] and moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, upon his retirement from the NYPD.&lt;ref name=nydailynews/&gt; He served inside [[Frank Sinatra]]'s personal [[security detail]] and as bodyguard when Sinatra performed at [[Caesars Palace]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He returned to New York City to take a security position at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (New York)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=nydailynews/&gt;

==Role on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!''==
Potenza had worked in security for more than ten years in New York City and Las Vegas when his nephew, [[comedian]] [[Jimmy Kimmel]], asked him to join his late-night show, ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', as a regular in 2003.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Potenza, who was still working security at St. Patrick's Cathedral at the time,&lt;ref name=nydailynews/&gt; accepted Kimmel's offer and moved to [[southern California]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He was introduced to audiences as Kimmel's "Uncle Frank," serving as a comic foil to the late night host.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Potenza appeared on the show for nine years from 2003 to 2011. Uncle Frank quickly developed his own fan following, with Kimmel noting in 2007, "People can tell that Uncle Frank is the genuine article... That's why they like him."&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

In one ongoing comic piece, Potenza was teamed with his former wife (and Kimmel's aunt), Concetta ("Chippy"), for a series of tasks ranging from [[self defense]] lessons to [[dairy farming]]. Potenza was also paired with [[Guillermo Díaz (Jimmy Kimmel Live!)|Guillermo Rodriguez]], the show's parking lot security guard, and [[Veatrice Rice]], the show's security guard, for comedic effect. Rice died of cancer on January 21, 2009.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

==Death and tributes==
Potenza died from cancer in Los Angeles on August 23, 2011, aged 77.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He was survived by his ex-wife, three daughters, and a granddaughter.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He was married to Chippy, for more than 28 years before their divorce. His memorial service was held in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; In a [[Twitter]] message, Kimmel thanked Potenza's fans, tweeting, "Thank you for your kind words about a very kind man" and "RIP Uncle Frank, his [[comic timing]] took a lifetime to earn. Today I eat cake for him."&lt;ref name=nydailynews/&gt; 

The show was on summer hiatus at the time of Potenza's death and was scheduled to return on September 6, 2011.&lt;ref name=ktla&gt;{{cite news|title=Jimmy Kimmel's Uncle Frank, Staple on 'Kimmel Show' Dies at 77|url=http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-kimmel-uncle-frank-dead,0,2611468.story|work=[[KTLA-TV]]|date=2011-08-23|accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, Kimmel aired a special tribute episode to Uncle Frank, with an interview with Frank's favorite guest, [[Don Rickles]]. A caricature of Uncle Frank appears in tribute on the back cover of [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]' album ''[[The Magic of Youth]]'', released on December 16, 2011 (the Bosstones' lead singer, [[Dicky Barrett]], is the announcer for ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4014">[[File:Wallace Spirit Photograph.png|thumb|right|Spirit photograph taken by Hudson of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and his mother.]]

'''Frederick Augustus Hudson''' (B. CA. 1812) was a British [[Spirit photography|spirit photographer]] who was active in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Chéroux, Clément (2004). ''The Perfect Medium: Photography and the Occult''. [[Yale University Press]]. pp. 29-44. {{ISBN|0-300-11136-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Raymond (2005). ''The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication''. [[Visible Ink Press]]. pp. 187-188. {{ISBN|1-57859-172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==

Hudson established his own studio in [[London]], and worked with the medium [[Georgiana Houghton]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Annette (2011). ''Paranormal Media: Audiences, Spirits and Magic in Popular Culture''. [[Routledge]]. p. 34. {{ISBN|0-415-54463-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Bill (1991). ''Cyanide &amp; Spirits: An Inside-Out View of Early Photography''. Nazraeli Press. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited as being the first spirit photographer in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Willburn, Sarah A (2006). ''Possessed Victorians: Extra Spheres in Nineteenth-century Mystical Writings''. [[Ashgate]]. p. 58. {{ISBN|0-7546-5540-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Joseph McCabe]], Hudson's photographs were exposed as fraudulent in 1872 by a fellow spiritualist, William Henry Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Joseph (1920). ''Spiritualism: A Popular History from 1847''. [[Dodd, Mead and Company]]. p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson was also exposed by another investigator. The psychical researcher [[Simeon Edmunds]] wrote that "John Beattie, a professional photographer of note, demonstrated conclusively that his spirits were faked by a simple process of double exposure."&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, Simeon (1966). ''Spiritualism: A Critical Survey''. [[Aquarian Press]]. p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] visited Hudson and a photograph of him with his deceased mother was produced. Wallace declared the photograph genuine, declaring "I see no escape from the conclusion that some spiritual being, acquainted with my mother's various aspects during life, produced these recognisable impressions on the plate."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Alfred Russel (1875). [https://archive.org/stream/onmiraclesmodern00wall#page/190/mode/2up ''On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism'']. London: James Burns. pp. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trickery==

Magic Historian [[Milbourne Christopher]] has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hudson introduced spirit photography to Britain in 1872. He varied his methods through the years. Though frequently caught practicing deception, he was never arrested. Hudson at one time used a trick camera, made by a craftsman who sold conjuring apparatus. [[Harry Price]] described how the camera worked in his book, ''Confessions of a Ghost-Hunter'', published in London in 1936. When the plate slide was inserted, this action brought the paper positive of the "ghost" up against the sensitive plate. When the shutter bulb was pressed, this image and the picture of the sitter were captured on the plate. Thus a single exposure on this plate carried both images.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, Milbourne (1975). ''Mediums, Mystics &amp; the Occult''. [[Thomas Y. Crowell Co.]] pp. 115-116. {{ISBN|0-690-00476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hudson was known to dress up as spirits or use [[double exposure]] to produce his spirit photography. Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] noted that Hudson's photographs were fraudulent. In many cases the sitter in the photographs was positioned low to the allow  space for the "spirits" already pre-positioned by Hudson.&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe (2012). ''The Science of Ghosts: Searching for Spirits of the Dead''. [[Prometheus Books]]. pp. 301-302. {{ISBN|978-1-61614-585-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaëtan Dugas''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡaetɑ̃ dyɡa|lang}}; February 20, 1953&amp;nbsp;– March 30, 1984), a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[flight attendant]], was a relatively early [[HIV]] patient who once was widely regarded as "[[index case|patient zero]]" or the primary case for AIDS in the United States; his case was later found to have been only one of many that began in the 1970s, according to a September 2016 study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC-October-26-2106"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-37767179 |title=HIV Patient Zero cleared by science |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=26 October 2016 |accessdate=26 October 2016 |first=James |last=Gallagher }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2016-10-27"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/health/hiv-patient-zero-genetic-analysis.html |title=H.I.V.

In March 1984, a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) study tracked the sexual liaisons and practices of [[gay]] and [[bisexual]] men, especially in California and New York. Dugas was code-named as "patient O" (pronounced "oh", and standing for "Out-of-California"); misconstruing of the letter "O" as 0 (zero) led to the origin of the term "patient zero."&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lrb"/&gt; The extent to which HIV/AIDS was known about in the early 1980s, how it was spread, or when Dugas was diagnosed are disputed.&lt;ref name=gtpmi&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKay|first=Richard A.|date=2014|title="Patient Zero":|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|pages=161–194|doi=10.1353/bhm.2014.0005|issn=0007-5140|pmc=4046389|pmid=24769806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Patient Zero" hypothesis==
[[File:AIDS index case graph.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|A 1984 paper&lt;ref name="Auerbach1984"/&gt; linked 40 AIDS patients by sexual contact. Of those patients, Dugas was the first to experience an onset of symptoms of AIDS.  In the above graph, Dugas is represented by the number 0. Because Dugas was very forthcoming in helping researchers, Michael Worobey concludes there may be [[sampling bias|ascertainment bias]] in the study.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/10/26/498876985/mystery-solved-how-hiv-came-to-the-u-s |title=Researchers Clear 'Patient Zero' From AIDS Origin Story |last=Doucleff |first=Michaeleen|date=October 26, 2016 |publisher=[[NPR]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A study published in ''[[The American Journal of Medicine]]'' in 1984 traced many early [[HIV]] infections to an unnamed infected gay male flight attendant.&lt;ref name="Auerbach1984"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Auerbach |first1=D.M. |author2=W.W. Darrow |author3=H.W. Jaffe |author4=J.W. Curran |title=Cluster of cases of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Patients linked by sexual contact |journal=[[The American Journal of Medicine]] |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=487–92 |year=1984 |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(84)90668-5 |pmid=6608269 |deadurl=no }}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 3, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, however, the CDC researcher, who was studying cases in Los Angeles, California, referred to Dugas not as "patient zero", but as "patient O", the letter "O" standing for "outside California".&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

Dugas is featured prominently in [[Randy Shilts]]'s book ''[[And the Band Played On]]: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic'' (1987), which documents the outbreak of the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|AIDS epidemic in the United States]]. Shilts portrays Dugas as having almost sociopathic behavior by allegedly intentionally infecting, or at least recklessly endangering, others with the virus. Dugas is described as being a charming, handsome sexual athlete who, according to his own estimation, averaged hundreds of sex partners per year. He claimed to have had over 2,500 sexual partners across North America since becoming sexually active in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |authorlink=Malcolm Gladwell |title=[[The Tipping Point]] |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |year=2000 |pages=21 |isbn=0-316-34662-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[David France (writer)|David France]]'s 2016 book ''[[How to Survive a Plague]]'', Shilts's editor expressed his regret for having "made a conscious decision to vilify Dugas in the book and publicity campaign in order to spur sales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I31ODAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT97&amp;dq=gaëtan%20dugas&amp;pg=PT79#v=onepage&amp;q=dugas&amp;f=false |title=How to Survive a Plague: The Story of How Activists and Scientists Tamed AIDS |first=David |last=France |authorlink=David France (writer) |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Pan Macmillan]] |date=December 1, 2016 |isbn=978-1-5098-3941-4 |page=PT79 |accessdate=December 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic analysis historically provided some support for the [[Index case|Patient Zero]] theory, in which Dugas was believed to be part of a cluster of homosexual men who traveled frequently, were extremely sexually active, and died of AIDS at a very early stage in the epidemic.&lt;ref name="Kuiken et al 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuiken |first1=C |last2=Thakallapalli |first2=R |last3=Esklid |first3=A |last4=de Ronde |first4=A |title=Genetic analysis reveals epidemiologic patterns in the spread of human immunodeficiency virus |journal=[[American Journal of Epidemiology]] |volume=152 |issue=9 |pages=814–22 |date=November 1, 2000 |doi=10.1093/aje/152.9.814 |doi-access=free |pmid=11085392 |deadurl=no }}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 3, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-examination of "Patient Zero" hypothesis==
{{see also|History of HIV/AIDS}}
A number of authorities have since voiced reservations about the implications of the CDC's Patient Zero study and characterizations of Dugas as being responsible for bringing HIV to cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. In the Patient Zero study, the average length of time between sexual contact and the onset of symptoms was {{fraction|10|1|2}} months.&lt;ref name="Auerbach1984" /&gt; While Shilts's book does not make such an allegation, the rumor that Dugas was the principal disseminator of the virus became widespread.&lt;ref name="lrb"/&gt; In 1988, Andrew R. Moss published an opposing view in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moss |first=Andrew R. |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4227 |title=AIDS Without End |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=December 8, 1988 |accessdate=December 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a group of researchers led by [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] Dr. Michael Worobey conducted a genetic study that looked at blood samples taken from gay and bisexual men in 1978 and 1979 as part of a [[hepatitis B]] study, and based on the results of the data, concluded that Dugas was not the source of the virus in the U.S. "On the family tree of the virus, Dugas fell in the middle, not at the beginning."&lt;ref name="Straube 2016-05-16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.poz.com/article/mapping-early-aids-us |title=Mapping Out Early AIDS in the U.S. |first=Trenton |last=Straube |date=May 16, 2016 |work=[[POZ (magazine)|POZ]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Beliefs about Patient Zero," Worobey concludes, "are unsupported by scientific data."&lt;ref name="Straube 2016-05-16"/&gt; Worobey's paper, published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in October 2016, finds "neither biological nor historical evidence that he was the primary case in the US or for [[subtypes of HIV|subtype]] B as a whole."&lt;ref name="BBC-October-26-2106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2016-10-27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woroby, Watts et al 2016"/&gt;

A study by historian Richard McKay of Cambridge and others identified several causes for the Patient Zero myth.  During early CDC analysis of cases in California, patient 057 (Dugas) was nicknamed patient "O" for "outside the area", but this was interpreted by others as Patient Zero.  Dugas was particularly helpful in tracing his network of partners, providing names and addresses for many of them, which was further expanded because others remembered his distinctive name.&lt;ref name="lrb"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crewe |first1=Tom |title=Here was a plague |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n18/tom-crewe/here-was-a-plague |accessdate=29 September 2018 |publisher=London Review of Books |date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of the patients analyzed reported in excess of 1000 sexual partners, most remembered "only a handful" of names, making their contacts to other cases more difficult to trace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-10/uoc-nr102416.php |title=New research reveals accidental making of 'Patient Zero' myth during 1980s AIDS crisis |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |date=October 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woroby, Watts et al 2016"/&gt;

Dr. Robert M. Grant, an AIDS researcher at the [[University of California]], has stated: "No one wants to be the Patient Zero of their village.  But this may be helpful because it says, ‘Just because you are the first to be diagnosed doesn’t mean you started the epidemic.’&amp;thinsp;"&lt;ref name="NYT 2016-10-27"/&gt;

In his last year in office, Dupré, by then an elderly deaf man, spoke out against the Long intra-party challenger, [[Dudley LeBlanc]] of [[Abbeville, Louisiana|Abbeville]] through the Long newspaper, the ''[[Louisiana Progress]]''.&lt;ref name=hpl/&gt;

==Biography==
Dupré was born into an established [[French people|French]]-American family, the son of Lucius Jacques Dupré (1822–1869) and the former Caroline Victoire Vanhille (1826–1896). His great-grandfather, [[Jacques Dupré]], was a pioneer of St. Landry Parish who served as a [[National Republican Party|National Republican]] [[governor of Louisiana]] from 1830 to 1831 and in the [[Louisiana State Senate]] during the 1830s and 1840s. Gilbert was only ten when his father, Lucius, who was a law graduate of the [[University of Virginia]] and a member of the former [[Confederate Congress]], died. There was no money for Gilbert's education; so he was self-educated in the law while he worked first in the office of the St. Landry Parish clerk of court. He was admitted to the bar in 1880 and established his law office in Opelousas. In 1887, Dupré was a member of the Louisiana state militia and was on active duty at the time of a riot in [[Morgan City, Louisiana|Morgan City]] in [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]]. He was a member of the [[Masonic lodge]], the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]], and the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=bio2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/132676391|title=Gilbert Louis Dupré|publisher=''St. Landry Trade Review''|date=December 1896|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1888 to 1992 and again from 1913, to fill the seat vacated by A. H. Garland, who left the state, until 1932, Dupré was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the Louisiana House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=house&gt;{{cite web|url=http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembership_History_CURRENT.pdf |title=Membership in the Louisiana House of Representatives, 1812- Current: St. Landry Parish |publisher=house.louisiana.gov |accessdate=March 6, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006105414/http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembership_History_CURRENT.pdf |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a state district court judge by election from 1896 to 1900 and by appointment in 1914. He was elected judge in 1916, 1920, and 1924, while he also served in the part-time legislative post. Such dual office-holding is no longer permitted. Judge Dupré, as he was long known, was a member of the Louisiana Constitutional Convention of 1921.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In his second stint in the legislature, his successors included his son-in-law, [[Felix Octave Pavy]], a prominent St. Landry Parish physician and an uncle by marriage of Dr. [[Carl Weiss]], the [[Assassination|assassin]] of [[U.S. Senator]] [[Huey Long|Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=house/&gt;

The editor of the former ''New Orleans Item'' referred to Representative Dupré's steadfast opposition to tax increases:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There was a statesman in [[Tennessee]] who attributed his popularity to the fact that he had never voted for a tax or against an appropriation. We might almost say of Judge Dupré that we do not recall his ever having voted for a tax increase, salary increase, or for an increased appropriation.
The position of the twelfth man in opposition to eleven stubborn jurors is one which the judge is not afraid to take in a world which loves to have unanimous action and where kickers are generally made uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Henry E. Chambers]], ''A History of Louisiana'', (vol. 2) ([[Chicago]] and [[New York City]]: The American Historical Society, Inc., 1925), pp. 378-379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1881, Dupré married Julia B. Estilette (1860–1944) of Opelousas, the daughter of his law partner, [[E. D. Estilette]]. She was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], where her father was attending [[Yale University]]. E. D. Estilette was a judge and in 1876 the [[Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives]]. The couple had four children, including twin daughters, a son, and a third daughter. He was a member of the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]]. Dupré outlived his wife by two years. They are interred along with other family members at the Myrtle Grove Cemetery in Opelousas.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

To retaliate against Dupré, Long had a hole drilled in the roof directly above Dupre's office in the [[Old Louisiana State Capitol]] to punish Dupré for the lawmaker's opposition to a new capitol building. When he demanded that Governor Huey Long repair the problem at once, Long said that he would do so only if Dupré would vote for the planned new [[Louisiana State Capitol]] building, to be built in [[skyscraper]] format.  When Dupré refused to commit his vote, Long told him, "Die, damn you, in the faith!"&lt;ref name=hpl&gt;[[Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]], ''Every Man a King: The Autobiography of Huey P. Long'' ([[New Orleans]]: National Book Club, Inc., 1933), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;
Long then noted that Dupré "was much amused and almost came over."&lt;ref name=hpl/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4742">'''Henri Louis La Fayette Villaume Ducoudray Holstein''' (born Heinrich Ludwig Villaume, on 23 September 1772 in [[Schwedt/Oder]], [[Uckermark]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Prussia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myerichsen.net/p124.html#i3716&lt;/ref&gt; – died on 23 April 1839 in Albany, New York) was a soldier in [[France]] and [[Venezuela]], and an author in the [[United States]].

==Biography==
Decoudray Holstein was an officer in the French Army under [[Napoleon]] and was taken prisoner in Cádiz, Spain. In 1813 Ducoudray Holstein departed for Philadelphia but was denied entry in the U.S. Army. In 1814 he arrived at [[Cartagena de Indias]], where he joined [[Simón Bolívar]] and was appointed officer in the army. With the grade of colonel he was an eye witness of the crucial revolutionary years 1814-1816.

In Cartagena he was first in the Corsairs of French privateer [[Louis Aury]], with whom he maintained a friendship, and later at militia corps of General Manuel Castillo y Rada, who just fought the royalists of Santa Marta during the liberation wars on the Río Magdalena. As in January 1815 entered a government crisis due to several coups in a short time with continued coups, he starred opposite Castillo y Rada, which ended the political instability militarily. Here he married the neogrnadine María del Carmen.

While general [[Pablo Morillo]] siege of Cartagena from late August to early December 1815, he served as General defending the fortress Boca Chica on the island of Tierra Bomba in the harbor entrance. The day before the surrender  fled to Haiti with the Venezuelan officers of Bolivar on the ship of his friend, the naval commander of Cartagena, Louis Aury. He met the Liberator Simón Bolívar in January 1816 in [[Port Au Prince]] and joined him. Holstein took part in [[Les Cayes Expedition]] to liberate Venezuela from Spanish rule. Landing at Margarita island  in May 1816 support the local establishment Bolivar as commander in chief. Despite the surprising taking of Carúpano by the vanguard of Bolivar, he saw clearly ahead of the forthcoming retreat of Ocumare de la Costa and left on June 23, the army of Bolivar. He embarked again to Haiti where disappointed with the cowardice, the womanizing and totalitarian behavior of Simón Bolívar,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} who has repeatedly fled during engagements against the Spanish enemy, Ducoudray Holstein resigned in 1816, left Bolívar army and moved to [[Aux Cayes]], Haiti in order to get by there as a bookseller and music teacher.

His experience with Bolívar and with the independence wars in Venezuela are described in {{cite book|isbn=1456545116| title=Memoirs of Simón Bolívar|ref=harv}}

He later moved to the United States, settling in [[Albany, New York]], where he became a language teacher and editor of ''The Zodiac''.

==Family==
He married Maria del Carmen (c. 1800 [[Colombia]] - 1 May 1855 [[Albany, New York]]); they had son Lafayette Ducoudray Holstein (1 August 1826 New York - 7 April 1864).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fpaludanb.dk/lisbeth/noter/ni895.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Neil Schulman''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ʃ|uː|l|m|ə|n}}; born April 16, 1953)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?665|title=Summary Bibliography: J. Neil Schulman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] novelist who wrote ''[[Alongside Night]]'' (published 1979) and ''[[The Rainbow Cadenza]]'' (published 1983) which both received the [[Prometheus Award]], a [[libertarian science fiction]] award. His third novel, ''Escape from Heaven'', was also a finalist for the 2002 Prometheus Award.

==Biography==
Schulman was born in [[Forest Hills, Queens]].  He is the author of nine other books currently in print, including a short story collection, ''Nasty, Brutish, and Short Stories'', ''Stopping Power: Why 70 Million Americans Own Guns'', and ''The Robert Heinlein Interview and Other Heinleiniana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulpless.com/jneil/books.html|title=Books by J. Neil Schulman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is writer of the ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Profile in Silver]]", first broadcast on CBS March 7, 1986.

From "About J. Neil Schulman" in ''The Fractal Man'':

J. Neil Schulman is an award-winning writer, filmmaker, journalist, and entrepreneur whom the Wall Street Journal called a pioneer of electronic publishing in 1989.

His 1979 Prometheus-Hall-of-Fame novel Alongside Night—endorsed by Milton Friedman, Anthony Burgess, and Ron Paul—projected the economic meltdown and was Freedom Book of the Month for May, 2009.

Alongside Night was his second feature film as writer/producer/director/actor, and starred Kevin Sorbo, Jake Busey, Gary Graham, Tim Russ, Garrett Wang, Mara Marini, and Said Faraj. After a red-carpet Beverly Hills premiere it released in a limited theatrical run in 2014, and is now available on Amazon Video &amp; Prime along with his award-winning 2008 comic thriller, Lady Magdalene's, starring Nichelle Nichols.

His latest novel is the science-fiction alternate-timeline romp, The Fractal Man, released by Steve Heller Publishing in May 2018 as a $0.99 Amazon Kindle.

Schulman is currently at work on his fifth novel, The Metronome Misnomer. The title comes from a fractal version of the author in The Fractal Man, who wrote a book of that title in an alternate timeline.

His 1983 novel, The Rainbow Cadenza, won the Prometheus Award, was adapted into a Laserium show, and Robert A. Heinlein told the 1983 L-5 Society, "Every libertarian should read it!" His 2002 novel Escape from Heaven has been compared to Mark Twain.

His short story “Day of Atonement” appeared in the Prometheus-award-winning Tor book Free Space, and his short story “The Repossessed” led off Carol Serling's anthology Adventures in the Twilight Zone. Both are reprinted in his short-story collection, Nasty, Brutish, and Short Stories.

Schulman scripted the CBS revived Twilight Zone episode, "Profile in Silver," about a future historian who creates a disastrous alternate timeline when he time travels back to November 22, 1963 and prevents JFK's assassination.

He taught a graduate course on electronic publishing for The New School, has written for popular magazines and newspapers including New Libertarian, Mondo Cult, National Review, Reason, the Los Angeles Times, and Reader's Digest, and monographs ranging from animal rights, informational property rights, and medicalization of criminology have been widely anthologized by academic presses.

His other books include Stopping Power: Why 70 Million Americans Own Guns, endorsed by Charlton Heston and Dennis Prager, Self Control Not Gun Control endorsed by Walter Williams, and The Robert Heinlein Interview and Other Heinleiniana, which Virginia Heinlein said "should be on the shelves of everyone interested in science fiction."

His latest printed book is The Heartmost Desire which includes two other of his books available as Amazon Kindles: Unchaining the Human Heart – A Revolutionary Manifesto (his answer to Mao's “Little Red Book”) and I Met God – God Without Religion, Scripture or Faith (his answer both to atheists like he used to be and to dogmatic religious zealots).

His Kindle book J. Neil Schulman's The Book of Words collects much of his humorous and controversial writings.

He's recipient of the James Madison Award from the Second Amendment Foundation, the Samuel Edward Konkin III Memorial Chauntecleer by the Karl Hess Club, and the Sovereign Award from the Libertopia convention.

== Literary Status ==

On ''[[Alongside Night]]''

"I received Alongside Night at noon today. It is now eight in the evening and I just finished it. I think I am entitled to some dinner now as I had no lunch. The unputdownability of the book ensured that. It is a remarkable and original story, and the picture it presents of an inflation- crippled America on the verge of revolution is all too acceptable. I wish, and so will many novelists, that I, or they, had thought of the idea first. A thrilling novel, crisply written, that fires the imagination as effectively as it stimulates the feelings." -- [[Anthony Burgess]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Alongside-Night-J-Neil-Schulman/dp/1584451203&lt;/ref&gt;

"An absorbing novel--science fiction, yet also a cautionary tale with a disturbing resemblance to past history and future possibilities."
--[[Milton Friedman]]

On ''[[The Rainbow Cadenza]]''

"I found it absolutely fascinating ... A splendid book." --[[Colin Wilson]]

"An original and thoughtful book which raises questions that have not appeared in fiction before." --[[Gregory Benford]]

"Every libertarian should read it. It should win the Prometheus Award."
--[[Robert A. Heinlein]], at the 1983 L-5 Society Conference, to Libertarian Futurist Society Chairman Michael Grossberg

On ''Escape from Heaven''

"Wild, irreverent, a hoot. Any other civilization would have burned Schulman at the stake. Did they know something we don't?" -- [[David Brin]]

On ''Self Control Not Gun Control''

"Schulman interestingly and insightfully raises a number of liberty-related issues that we ignore at the nation's peril. His ideas are precisely those that helped make our country the destination of those seeking liberty. The book's title says it all: personal responsibility, not laws and prohibitions, is the mark of a civil society." --[[Walter E. Williams]]

== Filmmaking ==

Schulman was the writer, director, executive producer (along with [[Nichelle Nichols]]) of the movie, ''[[Lady Magdalene's]]''&lt;ref name=IMDb_LM&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0783538|Lady Magdalene's}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was produced by Schulman's own company Jesulu Productions. The movie won three film-festival awards: "Best Cutting Edge Film" at the 2008 San Diego Black Film Festival,&lt;ref name=IMDb_LM/&gt; "Audience Choice – Feature-Length Narrative Film" at the 2008 Cinema City International Film Festival held on the Universal Hollywood Citywalk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasplash.com/publish/Film_106/Cinema_City_International_Film_Festival_Review_printer.php|title=Cinema City International Film Festival Review - A Savior of Short Films - Splash Magazines - Los Angeles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Special Jury Prize for Libertarian Ideals" at the 2011 Anthem Film Festival/FreedomFest held at Bally's Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthemfilmfestival.com|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Schulman completed production on a feature-film of ''Alongside Night'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{IMDb  title|tt1667061|Alongside Night (2014)}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Kevin Sorbo]], [[Jake Busey]], [[Tim Russ]], [[Garrett Wang]], [[Mara Marini]], and [[Gary Graham]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dujpepperman.com/jesulu/alongsidenight/AN_Credits.html&lt;/ref&gt; The movie premiered in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laemmle.com/films/38254|title=Alongside Night - Laemmle.com|website=www.laemmle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a limited theatrical release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alongside Night|url=https://www.tugg.com/titles/Alongside-Night|website=www.tugg.com|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released for streaming on [[iTunes]], [[Amazon Video]] and [[Amazon Prime]] and as a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Alongside-Night-Blu-ray-Combo-Pack/dp/B0113NVV1Y&lt;/ref&gt; The film is rated 2.7 out of 5 on Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Alongside-Night-Kevin-Sorbo/dp/B0163BSRWW/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professor John Edward Mack''' M.D. (October 4, 1929&amp;nbsp;– September 27, 2004) was an American [[psychiatrist]], writer, and professor and department head at [[Harvard Medical School]]. In 1976, Mack won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his book ''A Prince of Our Disorder'' on [[T.E. Lawrence]].  

Mack's clinical expertise at Harvard was in [[child psychology]], [[adolescent psychology]], and the [[psychology of religion]]. He was also known as a leading researcher on the psychology of [[teenage suicide]] and [[drug addiction]], and he later became a researcher in the psychology of [[alien abduction]] experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Feeney |first=Mark |title=Pulitzer Winner is Killed in Accident |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=September 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Early life, Education and Military Service==
Mack was born in [[New York City]], to an academic, [[German Jewish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1472937/John-E-Mack.html John E Mack] Telegraph Obituary, 30 Sep 2004&lt;/ref&gt; His father, the historian Edward Clarence Mack (1904-1973), was a professor at [[City College of New York|CUNY]], while his mother Eleanor Liebmann Mack (1905-1930) died while John was an infant. After his mother died, his father remarried the economist Ruth P. Mack, through which he had a half-sister, Mary Lee Ingbar, a pioneer of computer analysis who became a professor at [[Dartmouth College]] and [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/10/mary-lee-ingbar-dies-at-83 Mary Lee Ingbar, pioneer in field of health economics, dies at 83]The Harvard Gazette, October 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up, his father would read the Bible to John and his sister, but as a work of culture or literature. Mack graduated from the [[Horace Mann School|Horace Mann-Lincoln School]] in 1947 and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from [[Oberlin College|Oberlin]] in 1951, and received his medical doctorate degree ''cum laude'' from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1955. Mack subsequently interned at the Massachusetts General Hospital and trained as a psychiatrist at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. 

In 1959, Mack joined the [[US Air Force]], serving as a [[medic]] in [[Japan]], where he rose to the rank of captain. In 1961 he returned from military service in Japan, continuing at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center and Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute receiving certification in child and adult [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychotherapy]]. From 1964 Mack returned to Harvard Medical School, becoming a full professor at Harvard in 1972, and then becoming Head of the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, where he continued to work until his death. 

Mack published over 150 scientific articles and eleven books in his career. As department head at Harvard Medical School, he worked primarily in the field of child and adolescent psychology. He worked on treating suicidal patients, and published research on [[heroin addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;''Heroin Use as an Attempt To Cope: Clinical Observations'', EDWARD J. KHANTZIAN , JOHN E. MACK , and ALAN F. SCHATZBERG, The American Journal of Psychiatry, Volume 131
Issue 2&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant theme of his life's work at Harvard had been the exploration of how one's perceptions of the world affect one's relationships. He addressed this issue of "[[world view]]" on the individual level in his early clinical explorations of dreams, nightmares and teen suicide, and in ''A Prince of Our Disorder'', his biographical study of the life of British officer [[T. E. Lawrence]], for which he received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize for Biography]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Mack 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism during the Cold War ==
In the 1980s, Mack interviewed many international political figures as part of his research into the root causes of the [[Cold War]], including former United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] and the "father of the [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]]", [[Edward Teller]]. 

Mack, together with luminaries such as [[Carl Sagan]] and other [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]] (the United States affiliate of [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]]) promoted the elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the simmering conflict between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]. Emboldened by the organization's receipt of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1985, Mack, Sagan, and 700 other academics walked upon the grounds of the [[Nevada Test Site]] in the summer of 1986, setting a civil disobedience record for that nuclear weapons testing facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cevoli |first=Cathy |title=Putting It On The Line In Nevada |url=http://johnemackinstitute.org/1986/07/putting-it-on-the-line-in-nevada/ | journal=Nuclear Times |date=July–August 1986 |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The psychology of alien abduction phenomenon==
In the early 1990s, Mack commenced a decade-plus psychological study of 200 men and women who reported recurrent [[alien abduction|alien encounter]] experiences. Such encounters had seen some limited attention from academic figures, [[R. Leo Sprinkle]] perhaps being the earliest, in the 1960s. Mack, however, remains probably the most esteemed academic to have studied the subject.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

He initially suspected that such persons were suffering from [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], but when no obvious pathologies were present in the persons he interviewed, his interest was piqued. Following encouragement from longtime friend [[Thomas Kuhn]], who predicted that the subject might be controversial, but urged Mack to collect data and ignore prevailing materialist, dualist and "either/or" analysis, Mack began concerted study and interviews. Many of those he interviewed reported that their encounters had affected the way they regarded the world, including producing a heightened sense of [[spirituality]] and environmental concern.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Mack was somewhat more guarded in his investigations and interpretations of the abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that "On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go."&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 1998, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 interview,  Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed "inclined to take these [abduction] reports at face value". Mack replied by saying "Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't have a way to account for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Human Encounters with Aliens - Part 1: Abductions and the Western Paradigm |url=http://www.intuition.org/txt/mack1.htm |work=Intuition Network |date= |access-date=September 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926222933/http://www.intuition.org/txt/mack1.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, "I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [But] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is but it seems to me that it invites a deeper, further inquiry."&lt;ref name ="Hind 2005"/&gt;

Mack noted that there was a worldwide history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-[[industrialisation|industrial]] societies. One example is the [[vision quest]] common to some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures. Only fairly recently in [[Western culture]], notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts might best be considered as part of this larger tradition of visionary encounters.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

His interest in the spiritual or transformational aspects of people's alien encounters, and his suggestion that the experience of alien contact itself may be more transcendent than physical in nature&amp;nbsp;— yet nonetheless real&amp;nbsp;— set him apart from many of his contemporaries, such as [[Budd Hopkins]], who advocated the physical reality of aliens.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

His later research broadened into the general consideration of the merits of an expanded notion of reality, one which allows for experiences that may not fit the Western materialist paradigm, yet deeply affect people's lives. His second (and final) book on the alien encounter experience, ''Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters'' (1999), was as much a philosophical treatise connecting the themes of spirituality and modern world-views as it was the culmination of his work with the "experiencers" of alien encounters, to whom the book is dedicated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Investigation by Harvard for his work on "alien abduction" cases==

His humanity, compassion and solid science made themselves felt in that classroom... Because of the nature of his work, he made enemies in his profession, and in academia. But by his behaviour during the Harvard debacle, he proved himself to be tougher, more rigorous academically, and more the gentleman than political elements of that body of learning had themselves evinced. He won; they did not."
| source = —[[Stephen Geller]], 2004&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/05/guardianobituaries.obituaries1 John Mack]The Guardian, John James, Tue 5 Oct 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
In May 1994, the Dean of Harvard Medical School, Daniel C. Tosteson, appointed a committee of peers to confidentially review Mack's clinical care and clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien encounters with him (some of their cases were written of in Mack's 1994 book ''Abduction''). Angela Hind wrote, "It was the first time in Harvard's history that a tenured professor was subjected to such an investigation."&lt;ref name ="Hind 2005"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hind |first1=Angela |title=Alien thinking |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4071124.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=November 20, 2018 |date=June 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee chairman was [[Arnold S. Relman|Arnold "Budd" Relman, M.D.]], a Professor of Medicine and of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School who served as editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]''. According to [[Daniel Sheehan (attorney)|Daniel P. Sheehan]], one of Mack's attorneys, the committee's draft report suggested that "To communicate, in any way whatsoever, to a person who has reported a ‘close encounter’ with an extraterrestrial life form that this experience might well have been real&amp;nbsp;... is professionally irresponsible.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/klass_files_volume_32/&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the public revelation of the existence of the committee (inadvertently revealed during the solicitation of witnesses for Mack's defense, ten months into the process), questions arose from the academic community (including Harvard Professor of Law [[Alan Dershowitz]]) regarding the validity of an investigation of a tenured professor who was not suspected of ethics violations or professional misconduct. Concluding the fourteen-month investigation, Harvard then issued a statement stating that the Dean had "reaffirmed Dr. Mack's academic freedom to study what he wishes and to state his opinions without impediment," concluding "Dr. Mack remains a member in good standing of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine." (Mack was [[censure]]d in the committee's report for what they believed were methodological errors, but Dean Tosteson took no action based on the committee's assessment.) He had received legal help from Roderick MacLeish and Daniel Sheehan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://danielpsheehan.com danielpsheehan.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (of the [[New York Times Co. v. United States|Pentagon Papers]] case)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daniel P Sheehan, Legal Strategist and Constitutional Attorney |url=http://www.danielpsheehan.com |work=www.danielpsheehan.net |access-date=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the support of [[Laurance Rockefeller]], who also funded Mack's non-profit organization for four consecutive years at $250,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Paul B. |title=The Rockefeller UFO Report, or, How a Millionaire and a Socialite New Ager are Trying to Influence World Leaders about UFOs |url=http://www.parascope.com/nb/rockyufo.htm |year=1996 |work=www.parascope.com |publisher=ParaScope, Inc. |access-date=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On Monday, September 27, 2004 while in London to lecture at a T. E. Lawrence Society-sponsored conference, Mack was killed by a drunken driver heading west on [[Totteridge|Totteridge Lane]].&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"/&gt; He was walking home alone, after a dinner with friends, when he was struck at 11:25&amp;nbsp;p.m. near the junction of Totteridge Lane and Longland Drive. He lost consciousness at the scene of the accident and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. The driver, Raymond Czechowski, an IT manager, was arrested at the scene, and later entered a plea of guilty by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol. Mack's family requested leniency for the suspect Czechowski in a letter to the [[Wood Green]] Crown Court. "Although this was a tragic event for our family," the letter reads, "we feel [the accused's] behavior was neither malicious nor intentional, and we have no ill will toward him since we learned of the circumstances of the collision." The driver, Ray Czechowski served 6 months and was disqualified from driving for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bueche |first=Will |title=Driver In Dr John Mack Accident Sentenced |url=http://ufoupdateslist.com/2005/oct/m08-012.shtml |work=UFO Updates |date= October 7, 2005 |access-date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''manticore''' ([[Middle Persian|Early Middle Persian]] ''Merthykhuwar'') modern persian ("Mardykhor") is a Persian [[legendary creature]] similar to the Egyptian [[sphinx]] that proliferated in western European medieval art as well. It has the head of a human, body of a [[lion]] and a tail of venomous spines similar to [[porcupine]] quills, while other depictions have it with the tail of a [[scorpion]]. There are some accounts that the spines can be shot like arrows, thus making the manticore a lethal predator. It eats its victims whole, using its triple rows of teeth, and leaves no bones behind.

The '''mantyger''' is a creature of medieval invention, having the body of a [[Tyger (heraldry)|heraldic tiger]] with mane, and the head of an old man, the tusks of a boar and with long spiral horns.{{CN|date=June 2018}} Some heraldic authorities make the horns more like those of an ox, and the hands and feet like a monkey's.

==Origin==
The Manticore myth was of Persian origin, where its name was "man-eater" (from [[Persian language|early Middle Persian]] مارتیا ''mardya'' "man" (as in human) and خوار ''khowr-'' "to eat"). The English term "manticore" was borrowed from Latin ''mantichora'', itself derived from the Greek rendering of the Persian name, {{lang|grc|μαρτιχώρα}}, ''martichora''. It passed into European folklore first through a remark by [[Ctesias]], a Greek physician at the Persian court of King [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] in the fourth century BC, in his book [[Indica (Ctesias)|''Indica'']] ("India"), which circulated among Greek writers on natural history but has survived only in fragments, or references by those other writers. The Romanised Greek [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], in his ''[[Description of Greece]]'', recalled strange animals he had seen at Rome and commented,

{{quote|The beast described by Ctesias in his Indian history, which he says is called '''martichoras''' by the Indians and "man-eater" [''androphagos''] by the Greeks, I am inclined to think is the [[tiger]]. But that it has three rows of teeth along each jaw and spikes at the tip of its tail with which it defends itself at close quarters, while it hurls them like an archer's arrows at more distant enemies; all this is, I think, a false story that the Indians pass on from one to another owing to their excessive dread of the beast. (''Description'', 9.21.4)}}

[[Pliny the Elder]] did not share Pausanias' skepticism. He followed [[Aristotle]]'s natural history by including the ''martichoras'' – mistranscribed as ''manticorus'' in his copy of Aristotle – among his descriptions of animals in ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' 8:30, c. 77 AD.

Later, in ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' Greek writer [[Flavius Philostratus]] (c. 170–247) wrote:

{{quote|And inasmuch as the following conversation also has been recorded by Damis as having been held upon this occasion with regard to the mythological animals and fountains and men met with in India, I must not leave it out, for there is much to be gained by neither believing nor yet disbelieving everything. Accordingly Apollonius asked the question, whether there was there an animal called the man-eater (''martichoras''); and Iarchas replied: "And what have you heard about the make of this animal? For it is probable that there is some account given of its shape." "There are," replied Apollonius, "tall stories current which I cannot believe; for they say that the creature has four feet, and that his head resembles that of a man, but that in size it is comparable to a lion; while the tail of this animal puts out hairs a cubit long and sharp as thorns, which it shoots like arrows at those who hunt it."&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Philostratus, ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', translated by F. C. Conybeare, volume I, book III. Chapter XLV, pp. 327–329.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings.jpeg|thumb|right|Manticore or mantyger badge of [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|William, Lord Hastings]], c.1470. This version has tusks.]]

==Medieval and post-medieval appearances==
Pliny's book was widely enjoyed and uncritically believed through the European Middle Ages, during which the manticore was sometimes described or illustrated in [[Bestiary|bestiaries]]. Through [[false etymology]], it was sometimes assumed that the name was an amalgamation of ''man'' and ''[[tiger]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|manticore}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources regarded the ''mantyger'' as a different creature entirely (the mantyger having monkey-like feet, being apparently inspired by the [[baboon]]; and also sometimes being represented with either tusks or short horns).&lt;ref&gt;Dennys 1975, pp. 114–7&lt;/ref&gt; There was further confusion as to whether the manticore should be identified with or distinguished from the ''satyral'' and the [[lampago]].&lt;ref name="Dennys 1975, p. 114"&gt;Dennys 1975, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri]], in his ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', depicted the mythical creature [[Geryon]] as a manticore, following Pliny's description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/divina-commedia-di-dante-alighieri/oclc/1026178|title=La Divina commedia di Dante Alighieri,|last=Dante Alighieri|last2=Grandgent|first2=C. H|date=1933|publisher=D.C. Heath and Co.|location=Boston; New York|language=Italian|quote=Dante's image was profoundly modified, however, by Pliny's description---followed by Solinus---of a strange beast called Mantichora (''Historia Naturalis'', VIII, 30) which has the face of a man, the body of a lion, and a tail ending in a sting like a scorpion's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manticore or mantyger first appeared in English heraldry in c.1470, as a badge of [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings]]; and in the 16th century it was used as a badge by [[Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex]], and by Sir [[Anthony Babyngton]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennys 1975, pp. 115–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Randle Holme#Randle Holme III (1627–1700)|Randle Holme]] in 1688 described the manticore (which he regarded as distinct from the mantyger) as having
:the face of a man, the mouth open to the ears with a treble row of teeth beneath and above; long neck, whose greatness, roughness, body and feet are like a Lyon: of a red colour, his tail like the tail of a Scorpion of the Earth, the end armed with a sting, casting forth sharp pointed quills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Randle |last=Holme |authorlink=Randle Holme#Randle Holme III (1627–1700) |title=The Academy of Armorie and Blazon |place=Chester |year=1688 |page=212 }}; quoted in Dennys 1975, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The heraldic manticore influenced some [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] representations of the sin of Fraud, conceived as a monstrous [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]] with a beautiful woman's face – for example, in [[Bronzino]]'s allegory, "[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]" ([[National Gallery]], London),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John F. |last=Moffitt |title=An Exemplary Humanist Hybrid: Vasari's "Fraude" with Reference to Bronzino's "Sphinx" |journal=Renaissance Quarterly |volume=49 |issue=2 |year=1996 |pages=303–333 |doi=10.2307/2863160}} traces the chimeric image of Fraud backwards from Bronzino.&lt;/ref&gt; and more commonly in the decorative schemes called "[[Grotesque|grotteschi]]". From here it passed by way of [[Cesare Ripa]]'s ''Iconologia'' into the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French conception of a [[sphinx]].

[[Gerald Brenan]] linked the manticore to the ''[[mantequero]]'', a monster feeding on [[human fat]] in [[Andalusian folklore]].&lt;ref name="Brenan"&gt;''Al Sur de Granada'', pages 190-193, [[Gerald Brenan]], 1997, Fábula - Tusquets Editores. Originally ''[[South from Granada (book)|South from Granada]]'', 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Main|Manticore (disambiguation)}}
The manticore has been mentioned in ''Harry Potter'' novels and in the book ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''. However, it was introduced as a Greek monster by mistake.

In Emerson Lake and Palmer's 18 minute album, Tarkus, the 5th piece, Manticore, tells a tell of an armadillo who wants to conquer Earth and go through many trials, and in this piece, it is battling a Manticore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14625">[[File:Tristan Quilt, V&amp;A 03.jpg|thumb|14th century depiction of Mark of Cornwall from the [[Tristan Quilt]]]]

'''Mark of Cornwall''' ([[Latin]] '''''Marcus''''', [[Cornish language|Cornish]] '''''Margh''''', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] '''''March''''', [[Breton language|Breton]] '''''Marc'h''''') was a king of [[Kingdom of Cornwall|Kernow]] ([[Cornwall]]) in the early 6th century. He is most famous for his appearance in [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legend as the uncle of [[Tristan]] and husband of [[Iseult]], who engage in a secret affair.

==In Arthurian legend==
[[Image:King Mark of Cornwall 11400.jpg|thumb|"King Mark of Cornwall", illustrated by [[Howard Pyle]] (1905)|alt=|left]]

Mark sent [[Tristan]] as his proxy to fetch his young bride, the Princess [[Iseult]], from [[Gaelic Ireland|Ireland]]. [[Tristan and Iseult]] fall in love, and, with the help of a magic potion, proceed to have one of the stormiest love affairs in [[medieval literature]]. Mark suspects the affair and eventually his suspicions are confirmed. In some versions, he sends for Tristan to be hanged, and banishes Iseult to a [[leper colony]]. Tristan escapes the hanging and rescues Mark's bride from her confinement, later to be discovered by Mark. Mark eventually forgives them, with Iseult returning to Mark and Tristan leaving the country.

The story is cyclical with Mark suspecting Tristan and Iseult of adultery and then believing they were innocent. This happened again and again in the story. In the Beroul version, Tristan and Iseult are never in grave danger due to the narrator's declaration that he himself and God were on their side. King Mark, in the role of husband, is not portrayed as idealistic as other kings in Arthurian literature who were only portrayed in the role of king and not the personal role of husband.

In the ''[[Prose Tristan]]'', Mark's character deteriorates from a sympathetic [[cuckold]] to a downright villain. He rapes his niece and then murders her when she produces his son, Meraugis.  He murders his brother Baldwin as well. In earlier versions of the story, Tristan dies in [[Brittany]], far away from Mark; but in the ''Prose Tristan'', Mark stabs Tristan while he plays the harp under a tree for Iseult. Though this version of Mark's character was popular in other medieval works, including the ''[[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Romance of Palamedes]]'' and Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', modern versions of the Tristan and Iseult legend tend to take their inspiration from the older poetic material, and Mark becomes a [[sympathetic character]] once again. In these legends, Mark is usually seen as ruling Cornwall from [[Tintagel Castle]].

[[Marie de France]]'s [[Breton lai]] ''[[Chevrefoil]]'' (titled sometimes as ''The Lay of the Honeysuckle'') tells a partial story from the Tristan and Iseult tale. The lai begins with an explanation that Mark was enraged with Tristan's affair with his wife, and thus banished him from Cornwall. Tristan spends a year in his own land of South Wales, pining away for Isoude. Eventually, his sorrow grew so great that he went against Mark's order and hid in the woods of Cornwall, taking shelter with villagers only at night. Eventually Tristan comes to hear that Mark plans to hold a feast for [[Pentecost]], and that Isoude would be riding through the forest to attend. He finds the path the queen is most likely to take, and lays on it a hazel stick he stripped the bark off of and carved his name into. Isoude recognizes the sign and stops her party to rest, sneaking away with her maid [[Brangaine|Brangwaine]] to see Tristan. During this illicit meeting, Isoude helps Tristan to construct a plan to win back the favor of King Mark, which Tristan resolves to do as soon as the two part. Marie de France ends the poem by telling the reader that the lai Tristan composed was called "Goatleaf" in English or "Chèvrefeuille" in French, and that the very lai he composed was the one the reader just finished.&lt;ref name="chevrefoil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11417 |title=French Mediaeval Romances from the Lays of Marie de France |website=Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horse's ears==
Mark has become associated with a Celtic variant of the story of [[Midas]] and his donkey ears from [[Greek mythology]], due to a pun on ''marc'' which is a Celtic word for "horse".&lt;ref name=sargent-baur/&gt; The episode already occurs in ''Tristan'' by the 12th century French poet [[Béroul]], where the dwarf divulges the secret that "Mark has horse's ears" addressing a [[Common hawthorn|hawthorn]] tree, in the presence of three lords.&lt;ref name=sargent-baur/&gt;

There is a Breton legend which appeared in print in 1794, in which March was initially the king of [[Cornouaille]], France, seated at Ploumarch (Portzmarch).{{efn|He is only known as the "king of Portzmarch", not as Mark, in Cambry's version of 1794.}}&lt;ref name=cambry-1794/&gt; The king kills every barber who knows the secret about his ears, except one, who speaks the secret into the sand.&lt;ref name=cambry-1794/&gt; (or wind&lt;ref name=wood/&gt;). [[reed (plant)|Reeds]] subsequently grow from that spot, and the plants are harvested to make into [[Reed (mouthpiece)|reed]]s for the [[oboe]] (or simply make pipes&lt;ref name=wood/&gt;).

==The Drustanus Stone==
[[File:Plaque detailing the history of the Tristan Stone - geograph.org.uk - 800076.jpg|right|thumb|Plaque detailing the history of the Tristan Stone]]

Known as ''The Tristan Stone'', or ''The Longstone'' ({{lang-kw|Menhir}}, meaning ''long stone''), is a 2.7 m tall granite pillar near [[Fowey]], [[Cornwall]], originally situated at [[Castle Dore]]. The stone has a mid-6th-century two line inscription which has been interpreted as reading DRVSTANVS HIC IACIT CVNOWORI FILIV'S ("Drustan lies here, of Cunomorus the son"). A now missing third line was described by the 16th century antiquarian John Leland as reading CVM DOMINA OUSILLA ("with the lady Ousilla"). Ousilla is a Latinisation of the Cornish female name Eselt, otherwise known as Isolde. The disappearance of this third line may be as a result of the stone being moved several times.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Weatherhill, Cornovia: Ancient sites of Cornwall and Scilly 4000 BC – 1000 AD.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wrmonoc of Landévennec's ''Life of St. [[Paul Aurelian|Pol de Leon]]'', he refers to a "King Marc whose other name is Quonomorus." Also rendered Cunomorus, this name means literally the 'Hound-of-the-sea'.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas, Charles (1986) ''Celtic Britain''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson {{ISBN|0-500-02107-4}}; p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription on a 6th-century gravestone near the Cornish town of [[Fowey]] memorializes (in [[Latin]]) a certain "Drustanus son of Cunomorus" and it has been conjectured that this is the "Tristan son of Mark (alias 'Quonomorus')" of legend.&lt;ref name="longstone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=8342 |title=Tristan Stone [Longstone] Early Christian Sculptured Stone |website=The Megalithic Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a monument believed by some to refer to [[Tristan]] ("Drustanus") at {{gbmapping|SX112521}}.

However, in most versions of the story, Mark is Tristan's uncle. His sister is Tristan's mother, [[Blancheflor]] alias Elizabeth/Isabelle, or, in some later versions, he is related to Tristan's father, [[Meliadus]]. Some identify King Mark with King [[Conomor]] of [[Dumnonia]]. However, it is also thought that Wrmonoc may have made a mistake with his recorded alias. In [[Old Welsh]] records, Mark is recorded as "March son of [[Meirchion]]" and is variously associated with North [[Wales]], [[South Wales]] or South-West [[Scotland]]. The stone led to Mark's association with [[Castle Dore]].

==Modern interpretations==
King Mark takes on a much more gruesome role in [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson's]] poetry cycle ''[[Idylls of the King]]''. While Arthur and many of his knights are away taking on the court of the [[Red Knight]], [[Lancelot]] is called upon to judge "The Tournament of the Dead Innocence." The tournament quickly becomes a mockery, full of insults and broken rules. Tristram (that is, Tristan) is the winner of the tournament, winning all of the rubies from the necklace. Tristram then breaks tradition in presenting the rubies to a woman present, saying instead "This day my Queen of Beauty is not here." This enrages the crowd, with many saying that "All courtesy is dead," and "The glory of our Round Table is no more." Tristram, who in this piece married [[Iseult#Iseult of Brittany|Isolt of the White Hands]], carries his winnings instead to Mark's wife [[Iseult#Iseult of Ireland|Queen Isolt]], who is upset that Tristram married another woman. The two mock each other for a brief period before Tristram at last puts the necklace about Isolt's neck, and leans down to kiss her. Just as his lips touch her, in an uncharacteristically violent gesture, Mark makes his appearance, rising up behind Tristram and cleaving him through the brain.&lt;ref name="tennyson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennyson |first=Alfred |author-link=Alfred, Lord Tennyson |year=1983 |chapter=The Last Tournament |editor-last=Gray |editor-first=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8325">'''Marlene Garcia-Esperat''' (August 29, 1959 – March 24, 2005 in [[Tacurong City]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Philippines]]) was a [[Filipino people|Filipina]] [[whistleblower]] and [[investigative journalist]] who wrote a weekly anti-[[political corruption#Graft|graft]] column for local newspapers. As a result of her anti-corruption work, she was [[murder]]ed in her own home.&lt;ref name="Asia Cases 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/cases05/asia_cases05/phil.html|title=Asia Cases 2005|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography== 
Garcia-Esperat's career in journalism began accidentally: in the early 1990s, she was an [[analytical chemistry|analytical chemist]] for the Department of Agriculture, when she discovered that her laboratory was not receiving the funding it had been allocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcij.org/stories/2005/marlene.html|title=Farewell, Erin Brockovich|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the example of her first husband, '''Severino Arcones''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/gen/2005/04/05/news/marlene.garcia.esperat.madame.witness.html Sun.Star General Santos - Marlene Garcia Esperat: Madame Witness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013212/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/gen/2005/04/05/news/marlene.garcia.esperat.madame.witness.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a journalist who was murdered in 1989, Garcia-Esperat began her public activities. She also spent two years in the [[witness protection program]] due to her ombudsman discoveries.&lt;ref name="Asia Cases 2005"/&gt;

Her case is significant, as it is the first of the 56 murders of Filipino journalists since 1986 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcij.org/stories/2006/marlene-esperat.html|title=One Year after her Murder, No Justice for 'Erin Brockovich'|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which the people ultimately responsible were identified, in addition to the people directly involved. Esperat, as former employee of the Department of Agriculture in [[Central Mindanao]] (DA-12) and Midland Review, [[Tacurong City]] columnist, exposed the alleged [[Fertilizer Fund scam|Jocelyn "Jocjoc" Bolante fertilizer funds scam]], in which President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] was implicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2008/10/23/court.hands.arrest.warrants.to.journalist.s.slay.suspects.(1.05.p.m.).html sunstar.com.ph,  Court hands arrest warrants to journalist's slay suspects]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024063952/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2008/10/23/court.hands.arrest.warrants.to.journalist.s.slay.suspects.%281.05.p.m.%29.html |date=October 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks after the killing, '''Randy Grecia''' (one of the [[lookout]]s) surrendered to police, and subsequently pleaded guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/gen/2006/05/29/news/lawyer.in.esperat.murder.case.upbeat.html Sun.Star General Santos - Lawyer in Esperat murder case upbeat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030537/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/gen/2006/05/29/news/lawyer.in.esperat.murder.case.upbeat.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grecia and his three accomplices ('''Estanislao Bismanos''' and '''Gerry Cabayag''', who likewise pleaded guilty, and '''Rowie Barua''', who has become a State Witness) have testified that they were hired by two officials in the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Philippines Department of Agriculture]] of [[Central Mindanao]]. Murder charges were filed, but later dismissed.

The Esperat family lawyer, Nena Santos, told the Manila Standard that the dismissal of charges was "highly questionable and suspicious," and that it was a "miscarriage of justice."&lt;ref name="Asia Cases 2005"/&gt;
The case was re-filed.
The Cebu court convicted and meted out life imprisonment to Randy Garcia, Gerry Cabayag and Estanislao Bismanos who admitted they were hired for P120,000 to kill Esperat.&lt;ref name="February 12, 2008"&gt;[http://www.news.ops.gov.ph/archives2008/feb12.htm February 12 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203155308/http://www.news.ops.gov.ph/archives2008/feb12.htm |date=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the Department of Justice (DOJ) ordered the reopening of the investigation against alleged masterminds Montaner and Sabay, respectively, of the Department of Agriculture (DA) who were earlier excluded from the killing of Esperat by the Regional Trial Court in Tacurong City.&lt;ref name="February 12, 2008"/&gt;

Esperat's sister, Valmie Garcia Mariveles, who re-filed the charges against Montañer and Sabay, gathered more evidence. Accordingly, on September 28, 2008, [[Cebu City]] RTC Branch 7 Judge Simeon Dumdum approved the withdrawal of charges at the Cebu City Court for filing of murder case, instead against the alleged 2 masterminds before the Tacurong City RTC. Also, on October 20, 2008, the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)]] refiled the [[murder]] charges, in Tacurong City against Osmeña Montañer and Estrella Sabay, DA-12 finance officer and accountant, respectively, as masterminds. Meanwhile, the [[New York City|New York]] [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] welcomed  the issuance of [[arrest warrant]]s by [[Tacurong City]], [[Sultan Kudarat]] Regional Trial Court Judge Melanio S. Guerrero of Branch 20 against the 2 accused, amid the case hearing on October 27, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/128857/CPJ-welcomes-arrest-warrants-in-Esperat-case|title=CPJ welcomes arrest warrants in Esperat case|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tacurong RTC Judge Melanio Guerrero ordered the 2 accused to file a response within 10 days.

'''Miecław''' (also ''Masław'', ''Mojsław'' and ''Miesław'', ?-1047), in the [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] of chronicler [[Gallus Anonymus]] ''Meczzlavus'', was a ''pincera'' ([[cześnik|cup-bearer]]) of Duke [[Mieszko II of Poland]], and a rebel who tried to detach himself and [[Masovia]] from the Polish state by creating his own [[Miecław's State|country]]

Little is known about his early life. Initially he was a cup-bearer of Mieszko II and the governor of Masovia. However, an internal crisis and a [[Pagan reaction in Poland|pagan reaction]] led to the exile of Mieszko and rule of [[Bezprym]]. This weakened the Piast overlordship over Masovia. Initially, Mieszko's successor, [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]], did not have enough power to reunite the country and the region succumbed into chaos. The [[paganism|pagan]] reaction in Masovia was particularly strong and it is assumed that Miecław, having achieved delegated authority in Masovia under Mieszko, simply took advantage of the difficult situation to increase his rights or become independent.
 
However, Casimir I in 1039 was supported by [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]] against the [[Bohemia]]ns and soon afterwards he also concluded an alliance with [[Kievan Rus]]. This allowed him to gather enough forces to subdue Miecław. In 1047 he was attacked by the joint forces of Casimir I and [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] and was probably killed in a battle on the banks of [[Vistula]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7748">{{For|the populated place in Iowa|Moingona, Iowa}}
The historic Miami-Illinois people who are today referred to as the '''Moingona''' or Moingwena were close allies of or perhaps part of the [[Peoria (tribe)|Peoria]]. They were assimilated by that tribe and lost their separate identity about 1700. The name "Moingona" was probably the basis for the name of the [[Des Moines, Iowa|City of Des Moines]], the [[Des Moines River]], and [[Des Moines County, Iowa]].&lt;ref name="vogel"&gt;Vogel, Virgil (1983) ''Iowa Place Names of Indian Origin'' University of Iowa Press, Iowa City.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Iowa 1718.jpg|thumb|250px|1718 French map showing a river named Moingona -the present day Des-Moines river. Highlighted area is present state of Iowa.]]
[[File:Marquette and jolliet map 1681.jpg|thumb|left|Ca. 1681 map of [[Jacques Marquette|Marquette]] and [[Louis Jolliet|Jolliet]]'s 1673 expedition showing a Moingona village along what is now the [[Des Moines River]].]]

[[Jacques Marquette]] documented in 1672 that the ''Peolualen'' (the modern [[Peoria (tribe)|Peoria]]). and the ''mengakonkia'' (Moingona) were among the ''Ilinoue'' ([[Illinois tribe|Illinois]]) tribes who all "speak the same language."&lt;ref&gt;Thwaites, R. G, ed. (1899). [http://www.canadiana.org/view/07592/0045 ''The Jesuit relations, 1672-73''], p. 40, 42 (French), p. 41, 43 (English).&lt;/ref&gt;
Other names for them mentioned in 1672-73 records were "Mengakoukia," and "Mangekekis."&lt;ref&gt;Perrot, N. (1864). [https://books.google.com/books?id=2wby1-Aij2kC&amp;pg=PA222 ''Mémoire sur les moeurs, coustumes et relligion des sauvages de l'Amerique Septentrionale''] 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1673 Marquette and [[Louis Jolliet]] left their canoes and followed a beaten path away from the river out onto the prairie to three Illinois villages within about a mile and a half of each other. Marquette identified only one of the villages at the time, the  ''peouarea,'' but a later map apparently by him identified another as the ''Moingwena.''&lt;ref&gt;Thwaites, R.G., ed. (1900).

Father [[Jacques Gravier]] reports helping the close allies "Peouaroua and Mouingoueña" deal with a common adversary in 1700.&lt;ref&gt;Thwaites, R. G, ed. (1900). [http://www.canadiana.org/view/07599/106 ''The Jesuit relations, 1610-1791''], 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix]], a missionary who explored the region in 1721, recorded that "le ''Moingona''" was "an immense and magnificent Prairie, all covered with Beef and other Hoofed Animals." He italicized the term to indicate it was a geographical term and noted that "one of the tribes bears that name."&lt;ref&gt;deCharlevoix, P-F-X. (1744). [http://www.canadiana.org/view/33222/0148 ''Histoire et description générale de la Nouvelle France avec le journal historique d'un voyage fait par ordre du roi dans l'Amérique septentrionale''], 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Charlevoix was a professor or belles lettres, and his spelling has come to be a preferred spelling in general and scholarly discussions.

==Meaning of "Moingona"==

The meaning of  "Moingona" has been debated; historians have espoused conflicting definitions of the term, ranging from "People by the Portage" to "Clan of the Loon" and, more controversially, "Excrement-Faced".

===Moingona as "People by the Portage"===
Historic accounts suggest that Moingona was a term referring to people who lived by, or were encountered near, the portage around the [[Des Moines Rapids]]. The noted cartographer  [[Joseph Nicollet]] supported this interpretation, as did the Algonquian linguist [[Henry Schoolcraft]]. Schoolcraft and Nicollet's report says that "Moingona"

{{cquote|is a corruption of the Algonkin word ''Mikonang'', signifying ''at the road;''…alluding, in this instance, to the well-known road in this section of country, which they used to follow as a communication between the head of the lower rapids and their settlement on the river that empties itself into the Mississippi, so as to avoid the rapids; and this is still the practice of the present inhabitants of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Nicollet, J.N. (1845). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QmAUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA22 Report intended to illustrate a map of the hydrographical basin of the upper Mississippi River''], 22.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Moingona as "Loon Clan"===
An alternative interpretation is that Moingona is derived from the Algonquian clan name "Loon"; the Miami Indian term for loon is ''maankwa'', and many Algonquian villages took their names from tribal clans.
&lt;ref name="vogel"/&gt;

===Moingona as "Excrement-Faced"===
A controversial theory is that the root of the expression means "filth" or "excrement," and the expression means "excrement face."&lt;ref&gt;Challender, M. (2003, September 14).
[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030914/ENT/70323017 Is `Des Moines' just some dirty joke?] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120723212014/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030914/ENT/70323017 |date=2012-07-23 }} ''Des Moines Register''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In this theory, the name "Moingona", or, especially in its older French spelling, "Moinguena", is from Illinois ''mooyiinkweena'' "one who has shit on his face". This etymology is supported by Gravier's word "m8ing8eta", which he translates as "visage plein d'ordure, metaphor sale, vilain. injure". This verb, phonetically ''mooyiinkweeta'', morphologically consists of ''mooy''- "shit", -''iinkwee''- "face", and the third person singular intransitive suffix -''ta'', for a meaning "he who has shit on his face". The form "Moinguena", phonetically ''mooyiinkweena'', is the same verb but with the independent indefinite subject ending -''na'', for a more precise meaning "one who has shit on his face". The spelling "Moinguena" is exactly how the French spelling of the time would render the Illinois verb ''mooyiinkweena''. Perhaps this name arose as an insult given to the Moinguena by some neighboring tribe, as thus it is not known what the Moinguena called themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, David J. 2000. Miami-Illinois Tribe Names. In John Nichols, ed., Papers of the Thirty-first Algonquian Conference 30-53. Winnipeg: University of Manitoba.&lt;/ref&gt;
This scenario is rejected by the historian Jim Fay:&lt;ref name="fay"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fay|first=Jim|year=2010|title=Des Moines is Not an Insult: Thoughts on the Moingona Tribe|journal=Newsletter of the [[Iowa Archeological Society]]|location=Iowa City|volume=60|issue=1|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"There is no historical record that "shit-faced" was ever expressed or implied in the vernacular usage of the term. There is very substantial evidence to the contrary by probably the most knowledgeable Algonquian linguists who ever lived. Missionaries who understood the language repeatedly used the term, not as a dirty metaphor or ugly insult, but as a very respectful name used in very cordial interactions with the people to whom it referred."

In [[espionage]], agents under '''non-official cover''' ('''NOC''') are operatives who assume [[Covert operation|covert]] roles in organizations without official ties to the government for which they work. 

This is in contrast to an agent with [[official cover]], where they assume a position in their government, such as the [[diplomat|diplomatic service]], which provides them with [[diplomatic immunity]] if their espionage activities are discovered. Agents under non-official cover do not have this "safety net", and if captured and [[Espionage#Law|charged as spies]] are subject to severe criminal punishments, up to and including [[execution]]. Agents under non-official cover are also usually trained to deny any connection with their government, thus preserving [[plausible deniability]], but also denying them any hope of diplomatic legal assistance - or official acknowledgment of their service. Such agents or operatives may be referred to as a ''NOC'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|n|ɒ|k}} {{respell|NOK}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Sometimes, entire [[front companies]] or [[Strawperson|strawman]] entities are established in order to provide false identities for agents.

==History==
An agent sent to spy on a foreign country might, for instance, work as a businessperson, a worker for a non-profit organization (such as a humanitarian group), or an academic. For example, the [[CIA]]'s [[Ishmael Jones]] spent nearly two decades as a NOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/sep/07/baring-bureaucratic-hurdles-at-cia/ |title= Tripping Over CIA's Bureaucratic Hurdles |author=John Weisman |work=Washington Times |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the agents memorialized without names or dates of service on the [[CIA Memorial Wall]] are assumed to have been killed or executed in a foreign country while serving as NOC agents. In nations with established and well-developed spy agencies, the majority of captured non-native NOC agents have, however, historically been repatriated through [[prisoner exchange]]s for other captured NOCs as a form of [[gentlemen's agreement]].

Some countries have regulations regarding the use of non-official cover: the CIA, for example, has at times been prohibited from disguising agents as members of certain aid organizations, or as members of the [[clergy]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The degree of sophistication put into non-official cover stories varies considerably. Sometimes, an agent will simply be appointed to a position in a well-established company which can provide the appropriate opportunities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Other times, entire [[front organisation|front companies]] can be established in order to provide false identities for agents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Examples include [[Air America (airline)|Air America]], used by the CIA during the Vietnam War, and [[Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates]], used by the CIA in [[Weapons of mass destruction|WMD]] investigations and made public as a result of the [[Plame affair]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The journalist [[Udo Ulfkotte]] made a statement, referring to his past career at the German newspaper ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', that he worked as a NOC for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp-Wh77wt1o  |title=Dr Udo Ulfkotte, journalist and author, on RT |date=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Former MI6 officer "Nicholas Anderson" wrote an account of his service in a fictionalized autobiography (as per British law) entitled ''NOC: Non-Official Cover: British Secret Operations'', and two sequels: ''NOC Twice: More UK Non-Official Cover Operations'' and ''NOC Three Times: Knock-On Effect (Last of the Trilogy)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Kind of Traitor: an interview with former MI6 intelligence officer Nicholas Anderson|url=http://www.historyextra.com/period/modern/our-kind-of-traitor-an-interview-with-former-mi6-intelligence-officer-nicholas-anderson/|website=historyextra.com|publisher=Immediate Media Company|accessdate=February 21, 2018|date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Ross (Mossad officer)|Michael Ross]], a former [[Mossad]] officer, operated as a Mossad NOC or "combatant" as described in his memoir, ''The Volunteer: The Incredible True Story of an Israeli Spy on the Trail of International Terrorists'' (Skyhorse Publishing, September 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-60239-132-1}}).

Fictional examples include [[Chuck Barris]] who made a satirical claim to have been a NOC with 33 kills in his book and movie ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]''. Other examples are featured in the books ''[[Debt of Honor]]'', [[Ted Bell]]'s ''Pirate'', and ''[[The Eleventh Commandment (novel)|The Eleventh Commandment]]''; in the movies ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[Spy Game]]'', ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'', ''[[Safe House (2012 film)|Safe House]]'', and ''[[The Recruit]]''; and the TV shows ''[[The Americans (2013 TV series)|The Americans]]'', ''[[Burn Notice]]'', ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'', ''[[Covert Affairs]]'' and ''[[Patriot_(TV_series)|Patriot]]''.

'''Pashayi''' or '''Pashai''' (Persian: مردم پشه‌ای) are a [[Dard people|Dardic]] ethno-linguistic group living primarily in eastern [[Afghanistan]]. Their total population is estimated to be 500,000.&lt;ref name="sil.org"&gt;http://www.sil.org/asia/ldc/parallel_papers/ju-hong_yun.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patrick Burns''' (born 1968) is an [[United States|American]] [[paranormal investigator]], best known as star of the [[TruTV]] (formerly [[Court TV]]) series ''[[Haunting Evidence]]''. He is the founder of the popular website Ghost Hounds, which in 2001 was featured in an [[Emmy award]]-winning Turner documentary "Interact Atlanta - 'Ghost Hounds'&amp;nbsp;".  Burns is also the organizer and director of [[Ghostock]], paranormal enthusiast events held at various locations across the United States of America, and is a professional photographer through Patrick Burns Photography.

==Biography==
Burns was born September 29, 1968, the youngest of four boys in [[Highland Park, Illinois]], and grew up in [[Trout Valley, Illinois]], where he graduated [[Cary-Grove High School]] in 1987.

After graduating high school, Burns enrolled in [[Columbia School of Broadcasting]] radio announcing curriculum.  After completing the course of study, he worked in radio for a number of years.

Burns says that he had an uneventful childhood, with no exposure to paranormal activities, aside from what he read in books, until he was 18, at which time he began observing unusual phenomena.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  Several years later, while living in northern [[Wisconsin]], he heard from some friends speak about the ''Paulding [[Spook Light]]'' that appears nightly on a desolate road near the town of [[Watersmeet, Michigan]], in the [[upper peninsula]] region. Burns states that he briefly investigated, and quickly determined that it was being caused by distant car headlights and tail lights - the highway wrapped around and was exposed through the trees where it crossed a hill about 5 miles away, however the encounter was inspiration to pursue a career as a paranormal investigator.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Burns is a frequent speaker at [[Dragon*Con]], and goes by the handle '''Ghostgeek''' in the paranormal community.  He lectures extensively across the United States of America at various paranormal conferences throughout the year, and at universities and colleges during the month of October.

In 2008, he appeared in a bonus material excerpt on the 25th anniversary DVD of [[Poltergeist (1982 film)|''Poltergeist'']]

In October 2010, his first book was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt entitled, The Other Side:  A Teen's Guide To Ghost Hunting And The Paranormal, co-authored with his wife - young adult author, Marley Gibson, and Dave Schrader from Darkness Radio and the Travel Channel's Paranormal Challenge.

In 2011, he appeared as a recurring guest judge on two episodes of the ''[[Travel Channel]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s ''[[Paranormal Challenge]]''.

He is a professional photographer and shoots exclusively in [[infrared]] light.&lt;ref&gt;http://patrick-burns.net online gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns is married to author Marley Gibson.  The two of them currently travel the United States of America full-time in their RV motor home as an event speakers.  He is the father of two sons.

'''Paul IV''', known as '''Paul the New''' (Παύλος; ? – December 784) was [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 780 to 784.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Hussey (1986). ''The Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire''. Clarendon Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; He had once opposed the veneration of [[icons]] but urged the calling of an [[ecumenical council]] to address the [[iconoclasm|iconoclast controversy]]. Later, he resigned and retired to a [[monastery]] due to old age and illness. He was succeeded by [[Tarasios]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14451b.htm St. Tarasius]. "''In 784 when Paul IV Patriarch of Constantinople died Tarasius was an imperial secretary, and a champion of the veneration of images''.”&lt;/ref&gt; who was a lay administrator at the time.

Paul the New is venerated as a [[saint]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and his [[feast day]] is celebrated on August 30.

[[File:SelinaDolaro.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Selina Dolaro]]
'''Selina Dolaro''' (20 August 1849 – 23 January 1889) was an English singer, actress, [[Actor-manager|theatre manager]] and writer.  During a career in operetta and other forms of musical theatre, she managed several of her own opera companies and raised four children as a single mother.  She is best remembered as a producer of the original production of ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].

==Life and career==
Dolaro was born in London.  Her father was the violinist and conductor Benjamin Simmonds, and her mother was Julia (née Lewis).  Dolaro received early music lessons from her father's colleagues, and she attended the [[Paris Conservatory]] as a teenager to continue her musical studies.  In 1865, at the age of sixteen, she married Isaac Dolaro Belasco, an Italian Jew of Spanish descent, in Upper Kennington, England.  By 1870, she had adopted Dolaro as her stage name.&lt;ref name=Siegel&gt;Siegel, Michele. [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/dolaro-selina "Selina Dolaro"], ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia'', 1 March 2009, Jewish Women's Archive, accessed 12 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trial by Jury cover.jpg|left|thumb|Programme cover of April 1875 for ''[[La Périchole]]'' and ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', with caricatures of [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]] as cherubs framing a portrait of Dolaro]]
Dolaro made her stage debut at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], in the role of the Spanish princess, Galsuinda, in [[Hervé (composer)|Hervé]]'s [[operetta]] ''[[Chilpéric (operetta)|Chilpéric]]'' in 1870 and soon played there in [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] operettas.&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt; Successes at various London theatres followed: After a season at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], Dolaro starred in an English-language Offenbach adaptation called ''Breaking the Spell'', on tour with [[Fred Sullivan]]'s Operetta Company in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 5 September 1871, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 Dolaro was a leading performer in [[H. B. Farnie]]'s English-language adaptation of Offenbach's ''[[Geneviève de Brabant]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1872, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; in Hervé's ''[[Doctor Faust]]''&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 June 1872, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and in a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of [[Ferdinand Hérold]]'s ''[[Zampa]]'' ("Charmingly sung by Miss Dolaro in imitation of Mdlle Chaumont", said ''[[The Times]]'')&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 October 1872, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in the title role of [[George Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' in the first English-language production, with the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]], opposite [[Durward Lely]] as Don José.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, Dolaro divorced her husband on the grounds of his adultery and desertion; she brought up her two sons and two daughters on her own income.&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt;

By January 1875, Dolaro was director of the [[Royalty Theatre]], where her father served as musical director.  She starred as the title character in Offenbach's ''[[La Périchole]]'', uniting "vivacity as an actress" with "taste and skill as a singer".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 February 1875, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; As a replacement afterpiece to ''La Périchole'', her new theatre manager, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], commissioned ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' from [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]].&lt;ref&gt;In late January 1875, ''[[The Times]]'' ran advertisements for the Royalty Theatre: "In preparation, a new comic opera composed expressly for this theatre by Mr. [[Arthur Sullivan]], in which Madame Dolaro and [[Nelly Bromley]] will appear" (Allen, p. 28), and commentators took this as an advertisement for ''Trial by Jury''.  However, ''Trial'' has no place for two principal ladies. McElroy and others conclude that Sullivan was writing a two-act opera for the Royalty that was abandoned, and the music was soon re-used in Sullivan's ''[[The Zoo]]'', which has roles for two women. ''The Zoo'' played at another London theatre later in 1875 and at the Royalty in 1879 (McElroy, pp. 39–54). In any event, Bromley played the sole female principal role in ''Trial'', not Dolaro.&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan conducted the opening night performance of ''Trial'' on 25 March, but Dolaro's father generally conducted the orchestra thereafter until the end of its initial run on 12 June 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, pp. 7–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolaro took her Madame Selina Dolaro's Comic Opera Co. on tour between 13 June and 10 October 1875, as the theatre was closed during the hot summer months. On their return, [[Charles Morton (impresario)|Charles Morton]] became manager of the theatre.  Dolaro returned to the position in January 1876 when, again working with Carte, she played Malvina in ''The Duke's Daughter''. Dolaro continued to perform both in London and on tour, appearing at the [[Alhambra Theatre]] in 1877.  In 1879 she worked at the [[Folly Theatre]], which she also managed for the time.

Dolaro travelled to the United States that autumn, appearing in October at the [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]] in New York City in the title role of ''Carmen'', but reviews were mixed, with one critic commenting that she seemed "much more at home" performing in burlesque and [[comic opera]].&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt; She then joined a touring [[comic opera]] troupe before returning to London.  In 1880 she appeared again at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] as Cerisette in [[Henry Brougham Farnie|Farnie]] &amp; Genee's ''The Naval Cadets''.  Soon thereafter she moved to New York, where she spent the next few seasons performing in comic opera.  There, she worked under Carte's agency while appearing as Girola in Bucalossi's ''Les Manteaux Noirs'' and Katrina in [[Robert Planquette]]'s ''[[Rip van Winkle (operetta)|Rip van Winkle]]'' and as the Fairy Queen in Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[Iolanthe]]'', both in 1882 at the [[Manhattan Theatre|Standard Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Arthur | authorlink=Arthur Jacobs |year=1984|title=Arthur Sullivan: A Victorian Musician|publisher=Oxford University Press |page=176 |isbn=0-19-315443-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, an opinion piece in the ''New York Herald'' by a Reverend Philip Germond denounced "play-acting as a godless life."  Dolaro responded with a spirited defence of her profession: "Had I not been ‘launched’ on this ‘godless life,’ I should probably have been a burden to some parish or perhaps launched on what I regard as indeed a godless life. ... Is it not enough that we must slave as we do to earn the means to educate and train our children so as to enable them to become useful members of society without being assailed even from the pulpit with such outrageous slander?”&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt;

Dolaro's last part was Minnie Marden in an adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''Agnes'' in 1886.  Her health soon began to decline, as she began to struggle with [[tuberculosis]].  Her last appearance was in New York as a supernumerary in a benefit production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' for [[Lester Wallack]], played at Daly's Theatre in May 1888.

Dolaro died of a stroke in New York City in January 1889 at the age of 39.

==Publications==
Dolaro's play, ''In the Fashion'' (later known only as ''Fashion''), ran in New York between 1887 and 1888.  Her ''Mes amours: Poems, Passionate and Playful'', based on love letters that she had received, was published in 1888.  She also wrote a play called ''Justine''.

Dolaro also wrote novels, including: 
*''The Princess Daphne'', Belford, Clarke &amp; Co. (US), 1888 ([[Edward Heron-Allen]] with Selina Dolaro – a tale of psychic vampirism, involving mesmerism, doppelgangers and metapsychosis)
*''Bella Demonia'', Belford, Clarke &amp; Co. (US), [c.1889] (ghost written for Dolaro by Heron-Allen – an historical novel concerning the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78), published shortly after her death by ''[[Lippincott's Magazine]]'' 
*''The Vengeance of Maurice Denalguez'', Belford, Clarke &amp; Co. (US), [c.1889] (ghost written for Dolaro by Heron-Allen)

'''Slim Amamou''' ({{Audio|Slim_amamou.ogg|listen}} ({{lang-aeb|سليم عمامو}} {{transl|aeb|''Slīm ‘Amāmū''}}) (born 1977) is a [[Tunisian people|Tunisian]] blogger and a former Secretary of State for Sport and Youth in the [[Second cabinet of Mohamed Ghannouchi|transitional Tunisian government]] of early 2011. He resigned from the role in the week of 25 May 2011 in protest of the transitional government's censorship of several websites.&lt;ref name="guardian resign"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/25/tunisian-dissident-blogger-minister-quits | title =Tunisian dissident blogger quits ministerial post | author = Angelique Chrisafis| date =2011-05-25 | work = The Guardian | publisher = | accessdate = 27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Amamou studied at the [[University of Sousse]].&lt;ref name="linkedin"&gt;[http://tn.linkedin.com/in/slimamamou Slim Amamou's profile at LinkedIn] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716230145/http://tn.linkedin.com/in/slimamamou |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an influential [[blogger]] and author of [[ReadWriteWeb]] France.

==Political career==
He protested against [[censorship in Tunisia]] and organized a demonstration on 22 May 2010.&lt;ref name="leMonde"&gt;Isabelle Mandraud, « Au gouvernement, Slim Amamou, 33 ans, conserve ses réflexes de blogueur », ''Le Monde'', cahier spécial ''Tunisie : le sursaut d'une nation'', 21 janvier 2011, p. V&lt;/ref&gt;

He was arrested on 6 January 2011 during the protests that led to the [[Tunisian Revolution]], alongside others including [[Azyz Amami]]. The [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous hacktivist group]] had led attacks on the Tunisian government's websites, and Amamou was held for five days by the state security forces under the suspicion of having collaborated with the hackers.&lt;ref name=hish&gt;{{cite news|last1=Almiraat|first1=Hashim|title=Tunisia: Slim Amamou Speaks About Tunisia, Egypt and the Arab World|url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/11/tunisia-slim-amamou-speaks-about-tunisia-egypt-and-the-arab-world/|accessdate=9 June 2015|work=GlobalVoices|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a mass internet campaign and protest, Amamou and other bloggers were released from government custody.&lt;ref name=hish /&gt;

Amamou was later released, and, following the flight of [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]], a [[Second cabinet of Mohamed Ghannouchi|national unity government]] was formed. Amamou was invited to become Secretary of State for Sport and Youth ({{lang-ar|كاتب دولة للشباب والرياضة}}, {{lang-fr|Secrétaire d'État à la Jeunesse et aux Sports}}) in that government on 17 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://twitter.com/slim404/status/30747114560557056 | title =Twitter Post | author = | date =2011-01-29 | work = | publisher = | accessdate = 30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/9363808.stm

In his role as Secretary of State for Youth and Sports, he was subordinate to the Minister for Youth and Sports, [[Mohamed Aloulou]]. On 29 March 2011, he was expelled from the [[Tunisian Pirate Party]] for joining the transitional national unity government. He later joined a rival party, the [[Pirate Party of Tunisia]], instead.

On the week of May 25, he resigned from his post in protest of the transitional government's censorship of several websites at the request of the [[Tunisian Army]].&lt;ref name="guardian resign"/&gt;

==Political positions==
He supports the [[legalisation of cannabis]] in Tunisia. He is an advocate for [[network neutrality]] and opposes [[internet censorship]].&lt;ref name="guardian resign"/&gt;

'''Theophilos Kairis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Θεόφιλος Καΐρης; baptismal name Θωμᾶς ''Thomas''; 19 October 1784 &amp;ndash; 13 January 1853) was a Greek priest, philosopher and revolutionary. He was born in [[Andros]], [[Cyclades]], [[Ottoman Greece]], as a son of a distinguished family.

==Education==

Kairis studied in the theological school of [[Smyrna]] and was ordained a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] priest. He spoke many languages ranging from [[Ancient Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[English language|English]], that would allow him to participate in organizing the [[Greek War of Independence]] and to one day build the "Orphanotropheio" (Ὀρφανοτροφεῖο; Greek for "[[Orphanage]]"), a progressive school that embraced the modern [[university]] system. Kairis studied with Benjamin of Lesbos at the school of Kydonies, [[Asia Minor]], and was introduced to contemporary science and Greek interpretations of [[natural science]]. 

Kairis studied in [[Pisa]] and [[Paris]], and shared to the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He studied [[mathematics]], natural sciences and [[philosophy]]. Kairis also had an interest in [[archaeology]], making some major findings upon his native island of Andros. He also had an interest in [[botany]] and cataloged many of the plants of his local area, as well as documenting pharmacologic properties of various plants.

==Revolutionary activities==

Starting from 1811 he led Greek language high schools in Asia Minor. Eventually, he took an active part (1819–1826) in the Greek War of Independence and is now considered as an important figure in the [[History of Modern Greece]].

On May 10, 1821, Theophilos Kairis, one of the leading intellectuals of the Greek Revolution, declared the War of Independence by raising the Greek flag at the picturesque cliffside church of St George on the island of [[Andros]]: at this time, a  famous heartfelt speech, or "rhetoras", inspired shipowners and merchants to contribute funds and contribute ships to build a Greek Navy to combat the [[Ottoman Empire]]. 

There are many factors that influence the beginning of the Greek War of Independence. Furthermore, philosophy and science from [[Western Europe]] began to penetrate the [[culture of Greece]] at the same time of the establishment of the [[Philiki Etairia]], which was composed of intellectuals and merchants.

The views of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in European countries are in general well researched, while the attempts to introduce the Enlightenment to countries in the periphery of Europe, such as Greece, is not documented to the same degree. Many unanswered questions remain from this historical period, and surround the philosophic work of Theophilos Kairis. How did the scientific revolution migrate to the Greek-speaking regions occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire]]? How did the Greeks accept the truly revolutionary ideas of the [[French Revolution]] and liberalism? What were the reactions of the conservative [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and who sacrificed their lives in the cause of their ideas? 

Many of the orphans from the Greek War of Independence, especially from the massacre from the island of [[Psara]] would form the body of the Orphanotropheio, in which Kairis taught many of the ideas learned from [[Philhellenism|Philhellenes]] from all over [[Europe]]. Hence, this was the first true European university of Greece. 

Though he was an ordained priest, Kairis fought in the War of Independence and was severely wounded in one battle. Towards the end of the war, he was selected to draft the verbiage for Greece's Constitution. But when the European [[Great power]]s of the time installed [[Otto of Greece|Otto von Wittelsbach]] as a kind of Viceroy of the Powers he was not ready to integrate himself into the new system. King Otto offered him the position of Director of the University of Athens and awarded him the Gold Cross (equivalent to the Medal of Honor) for his contribution to the war, but Kairis turned both of these down. Instead, he continued to teach radical ideas of the Enlightenment which brought him into conflict with the King and with the Eastern Orthodox Church. Kairis became a victim of the Eastern Orthodox Church's equivalent of the [[Holy Inquisition]]. Kairis suffered a tragic end reserved by fate for those who, being pioneers, tried to introduce to Greece the liberal ideas of Western Europe and the Enlightenment.  The philosopher priest, Theophilos Kairis, following his conviction by the [[Holy Synod]] in 1839, was confined to the monastery in political exile on the island of [[Skiathos]].  He had been located to [[Syros]] for trial and execution but died in 1853, 10 days before his judicial hearing, of natural causes.

== Orphanotropheio of Theophilos Kairis ==

Theophilos Kairis, founded with a few disciples, a pietistic revivalist movement, known as [[Theosebism]], inspired by the French revolutionary cults, radical Protestantism and deism.  This movement was [[anathema]]tised by the Synod of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].

Beginning with 1826,  Kairis dedicated himself to an institute for orphans of the Greek revolution on Andros.  The "Orphantropheio", or orphan school, presented Kairis with the opportunity to introduce to the Greek education system a wide range of subjects ranging from [[comparative religion]], [[astronomy]], ship [[navigation]], [[agriculture]], [[applied mathematics]], [[accounting]], [[natural science]], advanced mathematics, and Theosebism.

Members of the Orphanotripheio represented children from all sides of the Balkan conflict, with individuals from [[Bulgaria]], [[Muslim]] [[Turkish people|Turks]] displaced by the Revolution, and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] who had inhabited the Greek island since the [[Middle Ages]].

In fact, Kairis had a very different vision for an independent Greece, one that was based upon the concept of [[separation of church and state]] as proposed by [[Thomas Jefferson]].  Kairis advocated for a pan-[[Balkans|Balkan]] state similar to the [[United States]], that preserved the cosmopolitan nature of the post-[[Byzantine Empire]] era, where all creeds were equally free of tyranny from the oppressive "Ottomans".

This was the prelude of the so-called [[Eastern Question]], the gradual dismemberment of the decaying [[Ottoman Empire]] by the Great powers.

== The Kairis Library ==

The library is housed in a wonderful neoclassical building, in Hora (or Andros Town) and contains about 3,000 tomes from the collection of Theophilos Kairis.  In the library are also exposed a large number of rare publications, manuscripts, historical records, works of art and a small archaeological collection. Within the records, extensive letters demonstrating a network of intellectuals would update Kairis about the trends in European science and philosophy.

[[File:Monument, Theofilos Kairis (Kairés), Andros town, 090596.jpg|thumb|200px|Bust in [[Andros]]]]

Also the mathematical treatises of Kairis are present, representing a very active and original intellect, who had written on complex themes, including on mathematical extensions of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]'s Celestial Mechanics.  Artifacts that demonstrate Kairis philosophic approach to understanding the energies (energiki ousia phiseos) of nature remain in the library, and highlight Kairis knowledge of [[Joseph Fourier]]'s work on [[energy]].  Through various letters and correspondence, Kairis's approach to communicating with the various philhellenes demonstrates a network of intellectuals that were involved with the [[French revolution]].  Kairis has been referred to as the "new Socrates" and was very active in didactic education.  The island of Andros has a series of water fountains, and horizontal [[windmill]]s constructed at the time the students from the orphanotropio were active on the Island, and represent applications from the Kairiki lessons. 

One can find books by Professor Mavromatis in the library, who edited Kairis's mathematical work, focusing on how Kairis use the Newtonian [[Binomial theorem|binomial]] to find the roots of [[cardinal numbers]].{{dubious|date=October 2012}}

Kairis was in constant communication with western intellectuals from Andros, and had communicated with [[Auguste Comte]], and wrote on his treatises on [[sociology]], then a newly emerging subject. Kairis has also incorporated these ideas into the curriculum of the orphanotropheio. Comte's ideas were tremendously influential on Kairis in the later years of the orphanotropheio, especially the idea that social ills can be solved as advocated by [[Jeremy Bentham]].

Kairis spoke many languages and was interested in teaching philosophy from the ancient Greeks, translating the great poetry and theatre from antiquity, as well as the philosophic treatises of Aristotle and Plato. Furthermore, lessons on the progressive subject of [[comparative religion]] was to be invaluable for the would-be ship captains and merchants embarked on international trade. Kairis would teach theosphitism, but in the context of world religions, ranging from Buddhism, many describing the philosophical thought of Kairis similar in vein as with the [[Transcendentalism]] of [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. 

Kiaris emphasised poetry as part of the curriculum and taught [[Lord Byron]]'s work, [[Robert Browning]] as well as poetry from the French and German speaking west. This was to create a naturalist and metaphysical aptitude balanced with the natural sciences and [[mathematics]].

Unfortunately, the school was disbanded after Kairis was declared a heretic, but many of the orphanotropio would go on into the shipping professions, and were also versed in accounting and probability. Of notable family names who can trace back ancestors who were schooled by Kairis were the [[Goulandris]] and [[Emberikos]] families. Other students hid in the surrounding mountains, taking with them the banned books from the school, and continued to live with the inhabitants of the island working and building some of the most interesting windmills in Greece.

Indeed, Kairis had also taught his students the early field of Archeology, and conducted field trips on the island to the place he had discovered the ruins of a temple dedicated to Aphrodite prior to the Greek revolution.

To this day, every summer, art exhibitions are organized in the new exhibition area of the library.

'''Nii Addo Quaynor''' (born 19 January 1982), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Tinny''', is a Ghanaian Rapper. He was born in Osu, Ghana to Mr. Ricky Tetteh Quaynor and Naa Badu Quaynor. He is the last-born of their six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicinghana.com/tinny/ |title=Tinny |work=Music in Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the early age of eight, by singing and rapping at parties and [[funfair]]s, he got into the music industry. In 1994 he started performing at [[Fun-World]], an entertainment programme which was organized every Sunday at the [[National Theatre (Accra)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanabase.com/tinny/ |title=Tinny - Music Artist |publisher=Ghana Base Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has released five studio albums since his debut.

==Early life==
Tinny was born Tinny Nii Addo Quaynor and grew up in the neighborhood of Osu and La both in Accra, [[Ghana]]. Young Tinny had his primary education at the Osu Home School and then went to Hepter International School at Akim Oda. He then went on to Osu Salem JSS and then proceeded to Okuapeman Secondary School for his secondary education. He was the [[entertainment]] prefect while he was at Okuapeman Secondary School and he organised shows for the students, as well as performed for them. He is the best friend of an artist known as RAP TWO.

==Music career==
===1994-1998: From Black Nature to Nature and Agony===
In his early years, Tinny took up his first [[stage name]] Black Nature. He performed at various entertainment shows with that name. While he was in Osu Salem JSS, he joined forces with two of his friends, Salam and Buke, who called themselves "Black Agony" as a duo, and formed a whole new a group called "Nature and Agony". This group was managed by Tinny's father, Mr. Ricky Tetteh Quaynor. They performed at by then very popular [[teenage]] [[music]] shows such as Kiddafest and [[Fun-World]]. However, Agony did not like the idea of Tinny's father managing them thus, they left the group. Tinny then went solo to perform at ‘Ecstasy Promotions’ where he chalked the 1st position. When he got to Okuapeman Secondary School, his dad booked sessions for him with [[Hammer of The Last Two]] which landed him into being part of the Last 2 family as a '[[foot soldier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanamusic.com/news/ghana-music-fact-file/ghana-music-fact-file-tinny/index.html |title=Ghana Music Fact File: Tinny' |publisher=Ghana Music.com |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;'.

===Road To Debut - Makola Kwakwe===
It was quite difficult for Tinny to come out since most [[hiplife]] artistes at the time sang and rapped in [[twi]] and Tinny on the other hand, was a native [[Ga language|Ga]] speaker and was therefore fixed on rapping in his [[ga language]]. His dream of making it to the top of the [[hiplife]] ladder came true when [[Hammer of The Last Two]] secured a deal for him with Abraham Ohene Djan ([[CEO]] of OM Studios). Abraham was carried away by his impressive lyrical flow after listening to his [[album]], he agreed to produce him. With a beat maker like Hammer at the [[Steering|helm]] of things, Nii Addo decided to use the name Tinny as his [[stage name]] because it was his real name and blasted onto the [[Ghanaian]] [[music]] scene in 2003 with ‘Makola Kwakwe’. He quickly became a sensation, gracing events and dominating [[radio]] and TV in his category. Tinny’s fame increased when he featured on the remix of ‘Oye Ohene’. His went on with his career and featured atrtises like Dogo, [[Obrafour]], K.K. Fosu, Etuoaboba, Bandana, FBS and Okra. He goes on to bless Obrafour’s Execution Diary with his voice on a track called I Believe I Can Fly (Heko Ejorko). Tinny won several awards following his debut like the New Artiste of the year at both Ghana Music Awards 2004 and Ghana Music Awards UK 2004 and a Youth Excellence award for being the ‘Youth Musician of the year 2003’. He was also awarded for being the Best Guest Entertainment Musical Artiste by Great Lamptey Mills.

In 2007, Tinny was picked by [[MTV]] to have his video for 'Incomplete' shot by world-renowned director Rachel Watanabe-Batton. This track was taken from his Aletse Ogboo album. In 2008, Tinny had the chance to record a single with [[Ja Rule]] when Ja Rule was in Ghana to perform during the 2008 Ghana Music Awards.

Since his debut he has maintained his position as an A-list artiste in Ghana, and as kept his name on top of the music charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigxgh.com/charts-top-ghana-music-downloads-for-1st-week-of-april/ |title=Charts: Top Ghana Music Downloads |publisher=GHflicks.com |date=2012-04-07 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
His knack at making Ga (a local dialect he usually sings and raps in) proverbs sound more appealing and the distinct style with which he flows (mostly rhyming) has not only endeared him to the youth across Africa but won him the respect of native Ga speaking people .
“Ricky, Naa Badu, Nakutso Bi” a popular line in most of his songs confirms the immeasurable support he receives from his parents Mr. Ricky Tetteh Quaynor and Christie –Lee Naa Badu Quaynor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news1.ghananation.com/entertainment/250850-tinny-blasts-charter-house-over-vodafone-music-awards.html |title=Tinny Blasts Charter House Over Vodafone Music Awards |publisher=News 1 |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==
===Cadbury Fairtrade Campaign &amp; Zingolo===
[[Cadbury]] launched a campaign using [[Ghana|Ghanaian traditional culture]] to raise additional funds for [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] growing communities. The campaign was a promotion for Tinny's track [[Zingolo]], as well as the Ghana-based dance troupe High Spirits. The [[Zingolo]] single is available on iTunes, with proceeds going to CARE, which funds education in [[Ghana|Ghana's]] [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] growing communities. The move follows the recent certification of [[Cadbury]] Dairy Milk across the UK and Ireland and builds on the work of the [[Cadbury|Cadbury Cocoa Partnership]], a 10-year initiative launched in 2008.

The [[Zingolo]] campaign was developed at [[Fallon, California|Fallon]], [[London]], by executive creative director Richard Flintham, creative directors Chris Bovill, [[John Allison (comics)|John Allison]], creatives Filip Tyden, Dan Watts, Chris Bovill, [[John Allison (comics)|John Allison]], account director Nathalie Clarke, agency producer [[Tom Goodwin]], executive producer [[Nicky Barnes]] and agency producer Gemma Knight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.myjoyonline.com/pages/news/200910/36514.php |title=Cadbury launches campaign to promote Fairtrade Cocoa |publisher=Joy Online |date=2011-09-14 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song, "Zingolo", was released on the newly established [[record label]] [[Cadbury's Dairy Milk|Glass and a Half Full Records]], established by [[Cadbury's Dairy Milk]] following their move to [[Fairtrade]] [[chocolate]].&lt;ref name="theinspirationroom"&gt;http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2009/cadbury-zingolo-from-ghana/&lt;/ref&gt;
The song, and the record label, were also set up to celebrate "all things Ghana, its people, its rappers, its dancers, it's cultural figures and, of course, its cocoa beans"&lt;ref name="theinspirationroom" /&gt;

The advertisement was broadcast on [[television]] and [[film|cinema]]. Featuring a 1-minute edit of the song, it is a short music video showing Ghana and a "cocoa head". It is their fourth advertisement in the ''Glass and a Half Full Productions'' campaign, which begun in 2007 with the award-winning [[Gorilla (advertisement)|Gorilla]] advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/939646/Cadbury-Dairy-Milk-launches-music-video-ad---watch/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mytinny – Contribution Campaign===
On 2 January 2007 he organized and performed two songs at his grand New Year’s party for 300 [[HIV/AIDS]] orphaned children at Manya-krobo in the eastern region of Ghana to mark the beginning of his “Mytinny – Contribution Campaign” which he says would be his Annual Social Responsibility Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mytinny.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=MyTinny  |date=2007-02-24 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2012 Tinny, as a former student of Okuapeman, visited the school to celebrate his birthday with the blind students with the aim of putting smiles on their faces.
Among the items donated included food and drinks, talking calculators, 51 packets of braille sheets among others.
The birthday party was organized by Hear Our Say Ghana, an Accra-based [[NGO|Non-Governmental Organzsation]] with support from Akua Pokua and Arisa, volunteers from Belgium and Japan respectively. Richard Berko, Tinny's [[Talent manager|Manager]] told BEATWAVES that students always looked up to them as their source of encouragement. 'I think most of us are in a position to help them and that is exactly what Tinny has done'.Speaking to the children, Tinny encouraged them to learn extra hard to become influential people in society, despite the poor conditions they found themselves in now. According to Tinny, he was concerned about the children's wellbeing, hence his visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/music/17120/3/tinny-donates-gh-3000-to-okuapeman-school.html |title=Tinny Donates GH¢ 3000 To Okuapeman School |publisher=Modern Ghana |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wade Omer Martin Jr.''' (April 18, 1911 &amp;ndash; August 6, 1990) was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Secretary of State of Louisiana]] under five [[governor]]s, having served from 1944 to 1976. Though originally part of the Long faction, Martin quarreled with Governor [[Earl Kemp Long]] during Long's third term in office, and Long relieved Martin of nearly all of his powers as secretary of state.

After having considered a [[Governor of Louisiana|gubernatorial]] bid on several occasions, Martin finally ran for governor in 1975, when, at sixty-six, he was overshadowed by the popular [[incumbent]], Democrat [[Edwin Washington Edwards]], who easily secured a second term. In retirement, the conservative Martin, thereafter firmly anti-Long, switched his party affiliation in 1979 to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to support [[David C. Treen]] for governor and [[Ronald W. Reagan]] for president.

==Early years and education==
Martin was born in [[Arnaudville, Louisiana|Arnaudville]] in [[St. Landry Parish]] to [[Wade O. Martin Sr.]] and the former Alice Mills. His grandfathers were Dr. G.W. Martin and Patrick Mills; his grandmothers were Ida Guilbeau Martin and Justine Fanguy Mills.

Martin received his bachelor's degree from what is now the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] (then Southwestern Louisiana Institute) in 1932. In 1935, he received his law degree from the [[Louisiana State University Law Center]] in [[Baton Rouge]]. Martin was also an LSU alumnus. On October 25, 1938, Martin married the former Juliette Bonnette (July 28, 1916—August 24, 1999).

Martin was an intimate of Governor and Senator [[Huey Long|Huey Pierce Long Jr]]. In 1932, Martin was elected to the then District 2 seat on the [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]. He served for twenty-four years until his death in August 1956. After the assassination of Huey Long, Martin had tried to run for governor in 1935 but was unable to mount a serious campaign.

Martin Jr. was an assistant Attorney General of Louisiana from 1935-1940. He set up a law practice in Baton Rouge from 1940-1944. He ran for Secretary of State against incumbent James Gremillion, an appointee of anti-Long Governor [[Sam Houston Jones]].

==The Louisiana election of 1944==

Martin Sr. and Jr. coaxed Gremillion to withdraw from the race, in which Gremillion had run second to Wade Jr.  Gremillion's exit hence made Wade Jr. the official Democratic nominee, equivalent at the time to election in overwhelmingly Democratic Louisiana. [[Bill Dodd|William J. "Bill" Dodd]], a state legislator at the time of the 1944 election, wrote in his memoirs, ''Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics'', "That a deal was made seemed evident -- when Gremillion wound up with a big job in Wade Jr.'s office."

The possibility had existed that there would have been no runoffs at all in 1944 if the Long candidate for governor, [[Lewis L. Morgan|Lewis Lovering Morgan]] of [[Covington, Louisiana|Covington]] in [[St. Tammany Parish]], had decided not to pursue a second primary against [[Jimmie Davis]]. Louisiana law then allowed runoffs for the lesser constitutional office only if there was also a runoff for governor. Somehow, the Martins convinced Gremillion that he would lose a runoff and that he should bow out and continue to work in the secretary of state's office, but under Wade Jr.

Earl Long later learned that his presumed allies, the Martins, along with Register of State Lands [[Lucille May Grace|Lucille May Grace Dent]], and others, had coaxed Morgan, whom Dodd called an "aged and somewhat senile attorney," to remain in the running for governor. At first, Morgan said that he would not challenge Davis in a runoff. The Martins and Miss Grace did not expect Morgan to defeat Davis. What they were attempting, according to Dodd, was the defeat of Earl Long, who was a candidate for [[lieutenant governor]] in a looming runoff against [[J. Emile Verret]] of [[Iberia Parish]]. Earl Long had led in the primary and would have become the Democratic nominee for the second spot had Morgan chosen not to continue the challenge to Davis. And while Davis defeated Morgan in the runoff, the results were closer than many had expected.

==Earl Long moves against Martin==

After his 1956 inauguration, Long convinced the legislature, the majority of the members being Long allies at the time, to move against Martin, who was himself considered a "Longite" by unofficial affiliation. Martin's office was stripped of four essential duties:

(1) a separate commissioner of insurance (Martin was insurance commissioner AND secretary of state from 1944-1956.) would be established, with [[Rufus D. Hayes]], taking the new position until 1964

(2) a separate position of "custodian of voting machines," later called "elections commissioner," would be established, and the secretary of state would no longer sit on the board that handled the purchase of voting machines,

(3) the secretary of state would no longer handle voter registration, and

(4) the secretary could no longer contract for and purchase printing services.

What duties did Martin retain? There were few, and all of an administrative nature. According to Bill Dodd, "Wade Jr. howled and screamed and accused Earl of being vindictive. But seasoned politicians and those who knew the facts of the 1944 campaign felt that little Wade got what politicians usually get when they do what Wade had done."

Martin was the author of the legislation providing for the numbering of candidates on election ballots to speed voting and to provide secrecy of the ballot for illiterates. He was a past president of the National Association of Secretaries of State and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

Over time, the secretary of state's office gradually regained its previous level of duties. The office was modernized and improved considerably during the long tenure of a Martin successor, [[W. Fox McKeithen]], a Republican who served from 1988 (when he was a Democrat) to his death in 2005. However, there still remains a separate insurance commissioner's office. Martin had appointed only one Assistant Secretary of State his entire tenure of office from 1944–1975, that being Joseph Riley Nelson of Baton Rouge.

In 1964, Martin joined a group of more conservative Louisiana Democrats  who endorsed Republican [[Barry M. Goldwater]] for president in the contest against [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Others who supported Goldwater were [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]] [[Sheriff]] [[J. Howell Flournoy]] of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], former Governors Sam Jones and [[Robert F. Kennon]], Lieutenant Governor [[Taddy Aycock|C. C. "Taddy" Aycock]], and [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] Mayor [[W. L. "Jack" Howard]].

Toward the end of his tenure, Martin hired [[Sandra Thompson (politician)|Sandra Thompson]], who was later the  director of the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya Basin Project]]. She ran unsuccessfully for secretary of state in 1979.

==Martin for governor?==

Martin considered a gubernatorial run in 1948, but he then pulled back to seek reelection, when he realized that Earl Long was a strong contender that year.

In 1969, Martin was appointed chairman of the state [[Radio Free Europe]] Fund. Earlier, he had been the first Louisiana resident to have been president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, when that office had been within the umbrella of the secretary of state.&lt;ref&gt;"Martin Appointed Chairman of State Radio Free Europe Fund", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', February 17, 1969, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Republican leader David Treen tried to persuade Martin, who was considered a conservative within the Democratic Party, to switch parties and run as the GOP candidate for governor in 1972. Martin again declined to run for governor and instead won an eighth consecutive term as secretary of state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Grover Rees, III]], ''Dave Treen of Louisiana'' (Baton Rouge: Moran Publishing Company, 1979), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Treen in fact made the first of his three gubernatorial races that year. The names "Wade O. Martin Jr." and "Louisiana secretary of state" had become synonyms in the Bayou State, or at the least there was a strong 32-year connection.

Martin finally ran for governor in 1975, after which time he had decided to retire as secretary of state. Edwin Edwards faced two Democrats that year, Martin and State Senator [[Robert G. "Bob" Jones]] of [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]], son of former Governor Sam Jones. Edwards prevailed with ease:  750,107 votes (62.3 percent). Bob Jones ran second with 292,220 votes (24.3 percent). Martin ran a weak third with 146,363 ballots (12.2 percent). Both Jones and Martin got some unofficial Republican backing in the gubernatorial election, and Jones was considered a possible candidate for 1979. Thereafter, both Jones and Martin became Republicans, but neither sought office again. Two Democrats, [[P.J. Mills]], a banker and a former state representative from [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], and State Senator [[Paul J. Hardy]] of [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]], contested Martin's seat in the 1975 general election. Hardy prevailed by some twenty thousand votes over another Democrat, [[P. J. Mills]].

Martin was thirty and married when the United States entered [[World War II]], but he did not enlist. Dodd, a World War II veteran, said he believed that Martin's failure to serve may have been a reason that he did not attempt to run earlier for governor. Of course, non-military service did not necessarily hurt Earl Long, whom Dodd flatly claimed in his memoir "was a draft dodger" in [[World War I]].

==Martin's obituary and legacy==
Martin was a [[Roman Catholic]] and, like his father, a member of the [[Knights of Columbus]], a Catholic men's organization. He was also active in the [[Woodmen of the World]] and was a member of [[Kappa Sigma]] fraternity and the [[Kiwanis International]]. He was on the board of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana, or CODOFIL. He was a fundraiser for the [[American Heart Association]], the [[American Cancer Society]], and [[United Cerebral Palsy]].

In retirement, Martin spent much time on his St. Martin Parish farm, where he raised [[sugar cane]] and other crops, including [[crawfish]]. He pioneered in the raising of fresh water [[shrimp]] in Louisiana. He also wrote books about government, practiced law, and was a consultant to the Louisiana Elections Integrity Commission.

Martin died in his Baton Rouge home. Services were held in St. Martin De Tours Catholic Church in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]]. Burial was in St. Francis Regis Cemetery in Arnaudville. Survivors included four sons, Wade O. Martin III (born 1944), of Baton Rouge, David Mills Martin (born 1950) of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]], Wallace T. Martin (born 1955) of [[Ridgecrest, California|Ridgecrest]], [[California]] ([[Kern County]]), and Gregory Bonnette Martin of Baton Rouge; two daughters, Mrs. Merle M. Dooley of [[Covington, Louisiana|Covington]] and Mrs. Marcelle M. Sherrill of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]], [[Kentucky]]; a brother, Dr. Murphy Martin (born 1913); two sisters, Leona M. Guirard (1908–2000) and Jeanne M. Svendson (1915–2002), fifteen grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Martin was divorced from his wife Juliette. She was living for a time in Ridgecrest to be near son Wallace Martin but had returned to Baton Rouge shortly before the time of her death. Grandson of Dr. Murphy Martin, Murphy "Tracy" Martin III, a grandson of Dr. Murphy Martin, is a physician, currently rotating at theEarl K. Long Medical Center in the field of internal medicine.

The auditorium of the Louisiana State Archives building, a part of the secretary of state's office, is named in Martin's honor. Martin is also remembered for his trademark [[bow tie]]. Martin was posthumously inducted in 2002 into the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Winnfield, Louisiana|Winnfield]].
