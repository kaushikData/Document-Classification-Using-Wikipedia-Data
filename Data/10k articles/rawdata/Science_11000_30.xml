'''''A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive''''' is an 1843 book by [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] [[John Stuart Mill]]. In this work, he formulated the five principles of [[inductive reasoning]] that are known as [[Mill's Methods]]. This work is important in the philosophy of science, and more generally, insofar as it outlines the empirical principles Mill would use to justify his moral and political philosophies.
An article in "Philosophy of Recent Times" has described this book as an "attempt to expound a psychological system of logic within empiricist principles.”

This work was important to the history of science, being a strong influence on scientists such as [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]].&lt;ref name=FarmeloDirac&gt;{{cite book| last=Farmelo | first=Graham | authorlink=Graham Farmelo | title=The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Quantum Genius | isbn=9780571222780| publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MillInfluenceDirac&gt;{{cite journal| journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | last=Cassidy | first=David C.| title=Graham Farmelo.

L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill revised the original work several times over the course of thirty years in response to critiques and commentary by Whewell, Bain, and others.

The '''American Educational Research Association''', or '''AERA''' ("A-E-R-A"), is a professional organization representing education researchers in the [[United States]] and around the [[world]].&lt;ref name="About-AERA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aera.net/About-AERA/Who-We-Are|title=Who are we|website=www.aera.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nonprofit serving the education research field, AERA strives to advance knowledge about education and promote the use of research in practice.&lt;ref name="About-AERA"/&gt;

== Organization and membership ==
AERA is led by Executive Director Felice J. Levine and 2018 - 2019 President Amy Stuart Wells (Teachers College, Columbia University).&lt;ref name="About-AERA_Leadership"/&gt; AERA's governance structure includes the Council, Executive Board, standing committees, and award committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aera.net/About-AERA/Organizational-Structure-and-Governance|title=Organizational Structure and Governance|website=www.aera.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary committees, task forces, and working groups are initiated for other specific needs.

AERA claims 25,000 members, including scientists, [[teacher]]s, students, [[Administration (business)|administrators]], [[State education agency|state]] and local agencies, [[School counselor|counselors]], and [[evaluator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aera.net/About-AERA/Who-We-Are/AERA-By-The-Numbers |title=AERA By The Numbers |website=www.aera.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad range of disciplines represented by the membership includes education, psychology, statistics, sociology, history, economics, philosophy, anthropology, and political science . There are 12 divisions covering different research areas in education.

== Early history ==
AERA (known originally as National Association of Directors of Educational Research) was founded in 1916 as an interest group within the [[National Education Association]] Department of Superintendence. The association’s eight founders - Burdette R. Buckingham, Albert Shiels, Leonard P. Ayres, Frank W. Ballou, Stuart A. Courtis, Edwin Hebden, George Melcher, and Joseph P. O’Hern – were all directors of education research in various parts of the United States. They met at the 1915 NEA Department of Superintendence annual meeting and came to the idea of starting an organization to advance education research. Their constitution was approved the following year, committing the association to improving public education.

Early topics of interest for early AERA included research bureau operations, measurement techniques, and particular school situations. Active membership in the early association was reserved for research bureau directors and their assistants. The association’s early years revolved around the annual convention. Between meetings, the association published an internal quarterly newsletter, the Educational Research Bulletin.

By the end of the [[World War I]] in 1918, the association had 36 active members and four honorary members and was affecting public policy, visible in the school districts that started to change student coursework and education practices as a result of standardized tests. Mental testing developments, primarily [[psychometrics]] as a result of the First World War, new subfields of education, and the growth of education research at the post-secondary level challenged the association to widen its mission. The association opened its membership to include anyone who could demonstrate their competence as a researcher indicated by their published or unpublished work. In 1922, members voted to adopt a name that represented their goal of representing the interests of all American education researchers – Educational Research Association of America. Over the years that followed, membership saw a dramatic increase, particularly among university personal, which grew from 48% to 69% between 1923 and 1927.

The association’s original publication, the Journal of Educational Research, began in 1919.

The ability of education research to provide guidance for education practitioners was a struggle throughout the association’s beginnings, with only ambiguous known relationships between testing and learning outcomes. The association recognized the need to establish theoretical foundations for the field of education research. In 1928, the association changed its name to the American Educational Research Association, as it is currently known.

During the Great Depression, the association’s public school affiliates struggled with tight finances and uncertain employment, but during the same time, university education researchers dominated the field and emerged as a unique social entity. Also during this time, AERA officials grew their relationships with like-minded associations, and a new journal, the [[Review of Educational Research]], began as a reference work, summarizing recent studies. While early topics in [[Review of Educational Research]] focused primarily on education psychology and administration, the publication broadened its coverage in the mid-1930s in response to diversification in the field.

The role of education research in the Progressive Education Movement was a source of contention between education researchers, some of whom felt that it should play an active role in policy issues, and others who felt that it should be used primarily for professional discourse. As the field continued to advance, much of the knowledge did not translate into practice, an issue that is still widely debated today. These divisions in the field made it difficult for education researchers to speak with one voice. Just prior to World War II, [[Review of Educational Research]] made the case that because science could not speak to goals and choices, education research should contribute as one source of many to shaping American education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aera.net/Portals/38/docs/About_AERA/AERA%20Early%20History.pdf|title=Education, Science, and the Politics of Knowledge: The American Educational Research Association, 1915–1940|last=Mershon|first=Sherie|last2=Schlossman|first2=Steven|date=|website=www.aera.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

== Events ==
AERA’s Annual Meeting held every spring is the largest gathering of scholars in the education research field with approximately 14,000 participants. The five-day conference is a showcase of research studies across education disciplines at all levels.

AERA also hosts the annual ''Brown'' Lecture in Education Research, which highlights the role of research in advancing equality in education. The first ''Brown'' Lecture was held in 2004 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' decision. 

== Education research and policy ==
AERA is expanding the availability of their resources by participating in the [[open access]] movement. AERA currently offers [[Educational Researcher (journal)]] [[open access]], as well as an Online Paper Repository containing presentations from the 2010 Annual Meeting forward. An [[open access]], peer-reviewed journal – AERA Open – is scheduled to launch in 2014.

On the policy front, AERA is actively involved in revisions to the [[common rule]]. Executive Director Felice J. Levine served on the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] committee charged with reviewing proposed regulations. The committee published its report in early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Proposed Revisions to the Common Rule for the Protection of Human Subjects in the Behavioral and Social Sciences {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18614|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AERA helps lead an ongoing initiative as part of the social science research community to increase federal funding for education research, particularly research in the social and behavioral sciences.

In addition, AERA is active in the reauthorization of the [[Institute of Education Sciences]] bill – Strengthening Education through Research Act – which was advanced by the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce]] in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = House Committee Advances IES Reauthorization Bill|url = http://www.aera.net/Newsroom/AERAHighlightsE-newsletter/AERAHighlightsApril2014/HouseCommitteeAdvancesIESReauthorizationBill/tabid/15478/Default.aspx|website = www.aera.net|accessdate = 2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education research initiatives ==
AERA is involved in several education research initiatives, ranging from specific advocacy topics to supporting projects that serve the larger community. AERA supports the Education Research Conferences Program, which awards grants for conferences on ground-breaking topics. AERA’s Education Research Service Projects is designed to encourage researchers to offer their expertise to organizations and groups who may have a need but not the funds to engage their assistance.

One topic area that AERA has been immensely involved is affirmative action. In 2013, AERA presented an amicus brief on the importance of science in a major affirmative action case – ''Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fisher v.

'''Animal repellents''' are products designed to keep certain animals away from objects, areas, people, plants, or other animals.

==Overview==
Repellents generally work by taking advantage of an animal's natural aversion to something, and often the thing chosen is something that the animal has learned to avoid (or instinctively avoids) in its natural environment.

For example, some animals will avoid anything that has the odor of the urine of predators.  [[Tiger urine]] is thus very effective at keeping away animals. [[Coyote urine]] has gained currency as a [[deer]] repellent. [[Fox urine]] is used to repel [[rabbits]], [[groundhogs]], [[woodchuck]]s, [[squirrels]] and [[chipmunks]]. [[Bobcat urine]] repels [[mole (animal)|moles]], [[mice]], [[voles]] and other rodents. [[Wolf urine]] is used to repel [[moose]]. Used cat litter is also effective, but needs repeated application.

Chemical repellents mimic natural substances that repel or deter animals, or they are designed to be so irritating to a specific animal or type of animal that the targeted animal will avoid the protected object or area. Some chemical repellents combine both principles. There are many homemade deer repellent recipes&lt;ref&gt;

For example, the lawn fertilizer [[Milorganite]] is claimed to be an effective repellent due to its smell.  Repellents fall into two main categories, odor and taste.  Odor repellents work better in the warm seasons and taste repellents work better in the cold months.    Taste repellents only work after the deer or other animal has taken a bite out of the plant.  If you have a plant you don't want nibbled on at all, use an odor repellent or a combination of both.

The scientists from University of Florida [http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw371 explain] that “Most of these deterrents operate through one of several mechanisms: odor aversion, taste aversion, or fear inducement”. Pepper, peppermint, tarragon, garlic, various essential oils, castor oil, diatomaceous earth, and putrescent egg solids are considered to be the so-called contact plant origin repellents operate through the first and the second mechanisms. The third type of repellents contains the ingredients of animal origin, such animals' enemies urine (such as coyotes or foxes), dried blood and hair induce pests animals' panic and make them flee, as confirmed by the University of Massachusetts Amherst specialists.

Other types of non-chemical repellents are sometimes used.  A simple electrified or [[barbed wire]] fence can mechanically repel livestock or predator animals.  Some electrical repellent systems have been tested against sharks.  High-frequency whistles have been used on vehicles to drive deer away from highways, and similar devices have been used to deter and repel certain types of insects or rodents.  Repellents for domestic [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s can also be found; these include [[ultrasonic device]]s which emit a high frequency noise that does not affect humans. These types of non-chemical repellents are quite controversial because their effectiveness varies from person to person. Furthermore, there have been few scientific studies conducted to prove that they do work. They are, however, a safe and humane way of disposing pests.

There are also few alternative ways to repel Cats and Dogs which are effective, such as repellent chemical Spray, [[Pet fence|electronic pet barrier]], motion activated sprinkler etc. In Addition, vinegar can be used as organic pet repellent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidentpet.com/how-to-keep-dogs-out-of-your-yard-flower-bed-garden/|title=Keep Your Dogs our of Your Yard|last=|first=|date=|website=www.presidentpet.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal repellent is completely specific for the target animal; that is, it drives away the animal that one wishes to repel ''without'' affecting or harming any other animals or people. One type of animal repellent may be effective for [[raccoon]]s, while another animal repellent may be more effective for [[skunks]]. It can be difficult to design a repellent method that drives away only undesirable animals while having no effect on people or other creatures.

'''Asset price inflation''' is a
[[economy|economic]] phenomenon denoting a rise in [[price]] of [[asset]]s, as opposed to ordinary [[goods and services]].
{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  Typical assets are [[financial instrument]]s such as [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], [[Share (finance)|shares]], and their [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], as well as [[real estate]] and other [[capital goods]]. Although the values of such assets are often casually said to "inflate," this should not be confused with [[inflation]] as a defined term. A more accurate description for an increase in the value of a capital asset is [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Asset+Appreciation appreciation].
{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Price inflation and assets inflation==
As [[inflation]] is generally understood and perceived as the rise in price of 'ordinary' goods and services, and official and [[central bank]] policies in most of today’s world have been expressly directed at minimizing 'price inflation', assets inflation has not been the object of much attention or concern. An example of this is the housing market, which concerns almost every individual household, where house prices have over the past decade{{when?|date=May 2018}} consistently risen by or at least near a two digit percentage, far above that of the [[Consumer Price Index]].{{where?|date=May 2018}}

==Possible causes==
Some [[political economist]]s believe that assets inflation has been, either by default or by design, the outcome of purposive policies pursued by central banks and political decision-makers to combat and reduce the much more visible price inflation. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} This could be for a variety of reasons, some overt, but others more concealed or even disreputable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Some think that it is the consequence of a natural reaction of investors to the danger of shrinking value of practically all important currencies, which, as in 2012 e.g., seems to them highly probable due to the tremendous worldwide growth of the mass of money. Their preference for real goods pushes their price up without any purposive policies from decision-makers.

==Possible results==
Asset price inflation has often been followed by an asset price crash, a sudden and usually unexpected fall in the price of a particular [[asset class]]. Examples of asset price crashes include [[Tulip mania|Dutch tulips]] in the 17th century, [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese metropolitan real estate and stocks]] in the early 1990s, and internet stocks in 2001. It was also a contributory factor in the [[2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}However, if the money supply has the potential to induce heavy general inflation (all major currencies in 2011/2012) none of these crashes may happen{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.

In a foundational controversy in [[history of mathematics|twentieth-century mathematics]], [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], a supporter of [[intuitionism]], opposed [[David Hilbert]], the founder of [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]].

== Background ==
The background for the controversy was set with [[David Hilbert]]'s axiomatization of geometry in the late 1890s. In his biography of [[Kurt Gödel]], [[John W. Dawson, Jr]] summarizes the result as follows: "At issue in the sometimes bitter disputes was the relation of mathematics to logic, as well as fundamental questions of methodology, such as how quantifiers were to be construed, to what extent, if at all, nonconstructive methods were justified, and whether there were important connections to be made between syntactic and semantic notions."&lt;ref name="Dawson1997-48"&gt;Dawson 1997:48&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawson observes that "partisans of three principal philosophical positions took part in the debate"&lt;ref name="Dawson1997-48"/&gt; – the logicists ([[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]), the formalists ([[David Hilbert]] and his "school" of collaborators), and the constructivists ([[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Hermann Weyl]]); within this constructivist school was the radical self-named "intuitionist" [[L.E.J. Brouwer]].

=== Brief history of Brouwer and Intuitionism ===
Brouwer in effect founded the mathematical philosophy of [[intuitionism]] as a challenge to the then-prevailing [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] of David Hilbert and his collaborators [[Paul Bernays]], [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], [[John von Neumann]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Kleene (1952), pp.&amp;nbsp;46–59&lt;/ref&gt; As a variety of [[constructive mathematics]], intuitionism is essentially a philosophy of the [[foundations of mathematics]].  It is sometimes and rather simplistically characterized by saying that its adherents refuse to use the [[law of excluded middle]] in mathematical reasoning.

In 1908: "... Brouwer, in a paper entitled "The untrustworthiness of the principles of logic", challenged the belief that the rules of the classical logic, which have come down to us essentially from Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) have an absolute validity, independent of the subject matter to which they are applied".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene (1952), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

"After completing his dissertation (1907: see Van Dalen), Brouwer made a conscious decision temporarily to keep his contentious ideas under wraps and to concentrate on demonstrating his mathematical prowess" (Davis (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;95); by 1910 he had published a number of important papers, in particular the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem|Fixed Point Theorem]]. Hilbert – the formalist with whom the intuitionist Brouwer would ultimately spend years in conflict – admired the young man and helped him receive a regular academic appointment (1912) at the University of Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=D96&gt;Davis, p.&amp;nbsp;96&lt;/ref&gt; It was then that "Brouwer felt free to return to his revolutionary project which he was now calling ''intuitionism''".&lt;ref name=D96/&gt;

In the later 1920s, Brouwer became involved in a public and demeaning controversy with Hilbert over editorial policy at ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'', at that time a leading [[learned journal]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{harvtxt|van Dalen|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He became relatively isolated; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student [[Arend Heyting]].

===Origins of disagreement===
The nature of Hilbert's proof of the [[Hilbert basis theorem]] (dating from 1888) turned out to be more controversial than Hilbert could have imagined at the time. Although Kronecker had conceded, Hilbert would later respond to others' similar criticisms that "many different constructions are subsumed under one fundamental idea" — in other words (to quote Reid): "Through a proof of existence, Hilbert had been able to obtain a construction"; "the proof" (i.e. the symbols on the page) was "the object".&lt;ref&gt;Reid 1996, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all were convinced. While [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] would die soon after, his [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] banner would be carried forward by sharp criticism from Poincaré, and later in full cry by the young [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] and his developing [[intuitionist]] "school"—Weyl in particular, much to Hilbert's torment in his later years (Reid 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;148–149).  Indeed, Hilbert lost his "gifted pupil" Weyl to intuitionism: "Hilbert was disturbed by his former student's fascination with the ideas of Brouwer, which aroused in Hilbert the memory of Kronecker."&lt;ref&gt;Reid 1996, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Brouwer the intuitionist in particular objected to the use of the Law of Excluded Middle over infinite sets (as Hilbert had indeed used it). Hilbert would respond: "'Taking the Principle of the Excluded Middle from the mathematician ... is the same as ... prohibiting the boxer the use of his fists.'&lt;ref name="SoMquote"&gt;This quote appears in numerous sources. A translation of the original can be found in van Heijenoort: Hilbert (1927) p. 476 and reads as follows: "Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists. To prohibit existence statements and the principle of excluded middle is tantamount to relinquishing the science of mathematics altogether."&lt;/ref&gt; "The possible loss did not seem to bother Weyl."&lt;ref&gt;Reid 1996, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity of the law of excluded middle===
In the same paper – the text of an address delivered in 1927&lt;ref&gt;cf. van Heijenoort: Hilbert (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; – Hilbert clearly expresses himself. At first he attempts to defend his axiomatic system as having "important general philosophical significance".&lt;ref name=:0&gt;van Heijenoort: Hilbert 1927 p.&amp;nbsp;475&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the statement of "definite rules" expresses "the technique of our thinking". Nothing is hidden, no [[tacit assumption]]s are admitted: "after all, it is part of the task of science to liberate us from arbitrariness, sentiment and habit, and to protect us from the subjectivism that ... finds its culmination in intuitionism".&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;

But then Hilbert gets to the nub of it – the proscription of the [[law of excluded middle]] (LoEM): :"Intuitionism's sharpest and most passionate challenge is the one it flings at the validity of the principle of excluded middle ...&amp;nbsp;."&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;

To doubt the LoEM—when extended over the completed infinite—was to doubt Hilbert's axiomatic system, in particular his "logical ε-axiom".&lt;ref&gt;He presents the ε-axiom in his 1927 address/paper. This "existence"-axiom asserts the existence of an object of discourse: "A(a) → A(ε(A)). Here ε(A) stands for an object of which the proposition A(a) certainly holds if it holds of any object at all ...&amp;nbsp;."(van Heijenoort p. 466). Immediately he goes on to demonstrate how the notions "for all" (the modern [[Universal quantification|universal quantifier]] "∀") and "there exists" (the modern [[Existential quantification|existential quantifier]] "∃") derive from this axiom.&lt;/ref&gt; To take away the LoEM was to destroy the "science of mathematics".&lt;ref name="SoMquote"/&gt; Finally, Hilbert singles out one man—by inference, not by name—for the cause of his present tribulation: "... I am astonished that a mathematician should doubt that the principle of excluded middle is strictly valid as a mode of inference. I am even more astonished that, as it seems, a whole community of mathematicians who do the same has so constituted itself. I am most astonished by the fact that even in mathematical circles the power of suggestion of a single man, however full of temperament and inventiveness, is capable of having the most improbable and eccentric effects."&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort: Hilbert 1927 p.&amp;nbsp;476&lt;/ref&gt;

Brouwer answers pique with pique: "... formalism has received nothing but benefactions from intuitionism and may expect further benefactions. The formalistic school should therefore accord some recognition to intuitionism, instead of polemicizing against it in sneering tones, while not even observing proper mention of authorship."&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort: Brouwer 1927b published in 1928, p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deeper philosophic differences ==

=== A philosophical defeat in the quest for "truth" in the choice of axioms ===
{{Synthesis|date=May 2010}}
However "truth" is ultimately defined, for a few mathematicians Hilbert's formalism seemed to eschew the notion. And at least with respect to his choice of axioms the case can be made that indeed he ''does'' eschew the notion. The fundamental issue is just ''how'' does one choose "the axioms"? Until Hilbert proposed his formalism, the axioms were chosen on an "intuitive" (experiential) basis. Aristotelian logic is a good example – based on one's life-experiences it just seems "logical" that an object of discourse either has a stated property (e.g. "This truck is yellow") or it does not have that property ("This truck is not yellow") but not both simultaneously (the Aristotelian Law of Non-Contradiction). The primitive form of the induction axiom is another – if a predicate P(n) is true for n = 0 and if for all natural numbers n, if P(n) being true implies that P(n+1) is true, then P(n) is true for all natural numbers n.

Hilbert's axiomatic system – his formalism – is different. At the outset it declares its axioms.&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert's writing is clean and accessible: for a list of his axioms and his "construction" see the first pages of van Heijenoort: Hilbert (1927).&lt;/ref&gt; But he doesn't require the selection of these axioms to be based upon either "common sense", [[a priori knowledge]] (intuitively derived understanding or awareness, innate knowledge seen as "truth without requiring any proof from experience"&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell 1912: 74&lt;/ref&gt; ), or observational experience (empirical data). Rather, the mathematician in the same manner as the theoretical physicist&lt;ref&gt;One of Hilbert's problems for the twentieth century was to "axiomatize physics" presumably in the same way he was attempting to "axiomatize" mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weyl in his 1927 comments on Hilbert's address discusses theoretical physics as a science with "individual assumptions and laws [that] have no meaning that can immediately be realized in intuition...](van Heijenoort p. 484)&lt;/ref&gt; is free to adopt any (arbitrary, abstract) collection of axioms that they so choose. Indeed, Weyl asserts that Hilbert had "formaliz[ed] it [classical mathematics], thus transforming it in principle from a system of intuitive results into a game with formulas that proceeds according to fixed rules".&lt;ref name=:1&gt;van Heijenoort p.&amp;nbsp;483&lt;/ref&gt; So, Weyl asks, what might guide the choice of these rules? "What impels us to take as a basis precisely the particular axiom system developed by Hilbert?".&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; Weyl offers up "consistency is indeed a necessary but not sufficient condition" but he cannot answer more completely except to note that Hilbert's "construction" is "arbitrary and bold".&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; Finally he notes, in italics, that the ''philosophical result'' of Hilbert's "construction" will be the following: "If Hilbert's view prevails over intuitionism, as appears to be the case, ''then I see in this a decisive defeat of the philosophical attitude of pure phenomenology'', which thus proves to be insufficient for the understanding of creative science even in the area of cognition that is most primal and most readily open to evidence – mathematics."&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

In other words: the role of innate feelings and tendencies (intuition) and observational experience (empiricism) in the choice of axioms will be removed except in the global sense – the "construction" had better work when put to the test: "only the theoretical system as a whole ... can be confronted with experience".&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

=== The Law of Excluded Middle extended to the infinite ===
Cantor (1897) extended the intuitive notion of "the infinite" – one foot placed after the other in a never-ending march toward the horizon – to the notion of "a completed infinite" – the arrival "all the way, way out there" in one fell swoop, and he symbolized this notion with a single sign ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (aleph-null). Hilbert's adoption of the notion wholesale was "thoughtless", Brouwer believed. Brouwer in his (1927a) "Intuitionistic reflections on formalism" states: "SECOND INSIGHT The rejection of the thoughtless use of the logical principle of the excluded middle, as well as the recognition, first, of the fact that the investigation of the question why the principle mentioned is justified and to what extent it is valid constitutes an essential object of research in the foundations of mathematics, and, second, of the fact that in intuitive (contentual) mathematics this principle is valid only for finite systems. THIRD INSIGHT. The identification of the principle of excluded middle with the principle of the solvability of every mathematical problem".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt;

This Third Insight is referring to [[Hilbert's second problem]] and Hilbert's ongoing attempt to axiomatize all of arithmetic, and with this system, to discover a "consistency proof" for all of mathematics – see more below. So into this fray (started by Poincaré) Brouwer plunged head-long, with Weyl as back-up.

Their first complaint (Brouwer's Second Insight, above) arose from Hilbert's extension of Aristotle's "Law of Excluded Middle" (and "double negation") – hitherto restricted to finite domains of Aristotelian discourse – to ''infinite'' domains of discourse&lt;ref&gt;See the lead paragraphs of van Heijenoort: Brouwer (1923b) p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;". In the late 1890s Hilbert successfully axiomatized geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Breger states that "Modern mathematics starts with Hilbert's ''Grundlagen der Geometrie''" (p. 226).&lt;/ref&gt; Then he went on to successfully (or so Hilbert thought) use the Cantorian-inspired notion of the [[completed infinity]] to produce elegant, radically abbreviated proofs in analysis (1896 and afterwards).&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer baldly itemizes the many other places where he thinks Hilbert has gone wrong, ''cf.'' van Heijenoort p. 491–492.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words of defense Hilbert believed himself quite justified in what he had done (in the following he calls this type of proof an [[existence proof]]): "...I stated a general theorem (1896) on algebraic forms that is a pure existence statement and by its very nature cannot be transformed into a statement involving constructibility. Purely by use of this existence theorem I avoided the lengthy and unclear argumentation of Weierstrass and the highly complicated calculations of Dedekind, and in addition, I believe, only my proof uncovers the inner reason for the validity of the assertions adumbrated by Gauss&lt;ref&gt;This is a sly poke at the finitists: "Empiricist philosophers, such as Hobbes, Locke, and Hume, had convinced some mathematicians, such as Gauss, that there is no infinite in mathematics" (Anglin p. 213).&lt;/ref&gt; and formulated by Weierstrass and Dedekind."&lt;ref&gt;Anglin, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; "The value of pure existence proofs consists precisely in that the individual construction is eliminated by them and that many different constructions are subsumed under one fundamental idea, so that only what is essential to the proof stands out clearly; brevity and economy of thought are the ''raison d'être'' of existence proofs."&lt;ref&gt;Anglin, p. 475&lt;/ref&gt;

What Hilbert had to give up was "constructibility" – his proofs would not produce "objects" (except for the proofs themselves – i.e. symbol strings), but rather they would produce contradictions of the premises and have to proceed by [[reductio ad absurdum]] extended over the infinite.

=== Hilbert's quest for a generalized proof of consistency of the axioms of arithmetic ===
Brouwer viewed this loss of constructibility as bad, but worse when applied to a generalized "proof of consistency" for all of mathematics.  In his 1900 address Hilbert had specified, as the second of his 23 problems for the twentieth century, the quest for a generalized proof of (procedure for determining) the consistency of the axioms of arithmetic.  Hilbert, unlike Brouwer, believed that the formalized notion of mathematical induction could be applied in the search for the ''generalized'' consistency proof.

A consequence of this marvelous proof/procedure P would be the following: Given any arbitrary mathematical theorem T (formula, procedure, proof) put to P (thus P(T)) ''including P itself'' (thus P(P)), P would determine conclusively whether or not the theorem T (and P) was ''provable'' – i.e. derivable from its premises, the axioms of arithmetic. Thus for all T, T would be ''provable'' by P or not ''provable'' by P and ''under all conditions'' (i.e. for any assignment of numerical values to T's variables). This is a perfect illustration of the use of the Law of Excluded Middle extended over the infinite, in fact extended ''twice'' – first over all theorems (formulas, procedures, proofs) and secondly for a given theorem, for all assignment of its variables. This point, missed by Hilbert, was first pointed out to him by Poincaré and later by Weyl in his 1927 comments on Hilbert's lecture: "For after all Hilbert, too, is not merely concerned with, say 0' or 0' ', but with any 0'&lt;sup&gt; ...&lt;/sup&gt; ', with an ''arbitrarily concretely given'' numeral. One may here stress the "concretely given"; on the other hand, it is just as essential that the contentual arguments in proof theory be carried out ''in hypothetical generality'', on ''any'' proof, on ''any'' numeral. ... It seems to me that Hilbert's proof theory shows Poincaré to have been completely right on this point."&lt;ref&gt;Weyl 1927, van Heijenoort p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

In his discussion preceding Weyl's 1927 comments van Heijenoort explains that Hilbert insisted that he had addressed the issue of "whether a formula, taken as an axiom, leads to a contradiction, the question is whether a proof that leads to a contradiction can be presented to me".&lt;ref name=:3&gt;Weyl 1927, van Heijenoort p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;
: "But [writes van Heijenoort] in a consistency proof the argument does not deal with one single specific formula; it has to be extended to all formulas. This is the point that Weyl has in mind ...&amp;nbsp;."&lt;ref name=:3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nagel and Newman note: "In the various attempts to solve the problem of consistency there is one persistent source of difficulty. It lies in the fact that the axioms are interpreted by models composed of an infinite number of elements. This makes it impossible to encompass the models in a finite number of observations . . . the conclusion that the argument seeks to establish involves an extrapolation from a finite to an infinite set of data. How can we justify this jump? ... Unfortunately, most of the postulate systems that constitute the foundations of important branches of mathematics cannot be mirrored in finite models." Nagel and Newman go on to give the example of the successor function ' (Gödel used f, the old-English symbol for s) – given starting-point 0, thereafter 0', 0{{'}}{{'}}, etc creates the infinity of integers. (p. 21–22) In response to this, Hilbert attempted an absolute proof of consistency – it would not presume the consistency of another system outside the one of interest, but rather, the system would begin with a [finite] collection of strings of discrete symbols (the axioms) and formation rules to manipulate those symbols. (cf p. 26ff)"&lt;/ref&gt;

If successful the quest would result in a remarkable outcome: Given such a generalized proof, all mathematics could be replaced by an automaton consisting of two parts: (i) a formula-generator to create formulas one after the other, followed by (ii) the generalized consistency proof, which would yield "Yes – valid (i.e. provable)" or "No – not valid (not provable)" for each formula submitted to it (and every possible assignment of numbers to its variables). In other words: mathematics would cease as a creative enterprise and become a machine.&lt;ref&gt;Breger notes: "Poincaré was not the only one to compare mathematics to a machine without an operator ... Frege claimed that he could not find out by Hilbert's axioms [of geometry] whether his watch fob was a point or not." (p. 227)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The problem of the Law of Excluded Middle with respect to induction ===
In van Heijenoort's commentary preceding Weyl's (1927) "Comments on Hilbert's second lecture on the foundations of mathematics" Poincaré points out to Hilbert (1905) that there are two types of "induction" (1) the intuitive animal-logic foot-following-foot version that gives us a sense that there's always another footstep after the last footstep, and (2) the formal version – e.g. Peano's version: a string of symbols.&lt;ref&gt;cf Russell 1912's chapter VI Induction p.60–69, where he discusses animal logic and the problem of knowing a truth and formulating natural laws.&lt;/ref&gt; The gang of three – Poincaré, Weyl and Brouwer – claimed that Hilbert tacitly, and unjustifiably, adopted as one of his premises formal induction (the symbol string). Poincaré (1905) asserted that, by doing this, Hilbert's reasoning became circular.&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' van Heijenoort's commentary on Weyl (1927).&lt;/ref&gt; Weyl's (1927) agreement and Brouwer's polemics ultimately forced Hilbert and his disciples Herbrand, Bernays and Ackermann to reexamine their notion of "induction" – to eschew the assumption of a "totality of all the objects x of an infinite collection" and (intuitionistically) assume that the general argument proceeds one x after another, ad infinitum (van Heijenoort p.&amp;nbsp;481, footnote a). This is in fact the so-called "induction schema" used in the notion of "recursion" that was still in development at this time (''cf.'' van Heijenoort p.&amp;nbsp;493)&lt;ref&gt;"Recursion" had been around at least since Peano provided his definition of the addition of numbers (''cf.'' van Heijenoort p. 95, Definition 18).&lt;/ref&gt; – this schema was acceptable to the intuitionists because it had been derived from "the intuition".

To carry this distinction further, Kleene 1952/1977 distinguishes between '''three''' types of mathematical induction – (1) the formal '''Induction Rule''' (Peano's axiom, see the next section for an example), (2) the '''inductive definition''' (examples: counting, "Proof by induction"), and (3) the '''definition by induction''' (recursive definition of "number-theoretic functions or predicates). With regards to (3), Kleene considers [[primitive recursive function]]s:

{{quote|"an intuitive theory about a certain class of number theoretic functions and predicates ... In this theory, as in metamathematics, we shall use only finitary methods.

The series of the natural numbers 0, 0', 0{{'}}{{'}}, 0{{'}}{{'}}{{'}}, ..., or 0, 1, 2, 3, ... we described as the class of the objects generated from one primitive object 0 by means of one primitive operation ' or +1. This constitutes an inductive definition of the class of the natural numbers.

Proof by induction ... corresponds immediately to this mode of generating the numbers. Definition by induction (not to be confused with 'inductive definition' ...) is the analogous method of defining a number-theoretic function φ(y) or predicate P(y). [A number-theoretic function or predicate takes as its variables only a selection from the natural numbers and produces only a single natural number in turn]. First φ(0) or P(0) (the value of the function or predicate for 0 as argument) is given. Then, for any natural number y, φ(y') or P(y') (the next value after that for y) is expressed in terms of y and φ(y) or P(y) (the value of y). ... The two parts of the definition enable us, as we generate any natural number y, at the same time to determine the value φ(y) or P(y)." (p.&amp;nbsp;217)}}

=== Echoes of the controversy ===
Brouwer's insistence on "constructibility" in the search for a "consistency proof for arithmetic" resulted in sensitivity to the issue as reflected by the work of [[Paul Finsler|Finsler]] and Gödel.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson notes that "Brouwer's role in stimulating Gödel's thought seems beyond doubt, [but] how Gödel became aware of Brouwer's work remains uncertain" (Dawson 1997:55).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately Gödel would "numeralize" his formulae; Gödel then used primitive recursion (and its instantiation of the intuitive, constructive form of induction – i.e. counting and step-by-step evaluation) rather than a string of symbols that represent formal induction. Gödel was so sensitive to this issue that he took great pains in his 1931 to point out that his Theorem VI (the so-called "First incompleteness theorem") "is constructive;&lt;sup&gt;45a&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, the following has been proved in an intuitionistically unobjectionable manner ...&amp;nbsp;." He then demonstrates what he believes to be the constructive nature of his "generalization formula" 17 Gen r. Footnote 45a reinforces his point.

Gödel's 1931 does include the formalist's symbol-version of the Peano Induction Axiom; it looks like this, where "." is the logical AND, f is the successor-sign, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a function, x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a variable, x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Π designates "for all values of variable x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;":
: (x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0).x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Π(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)⊃x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(fx&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;))⊃x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Π(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;))
But he does not appear to use this in the formalist's sense.

Note that there is contention around this point. Gödel specifies this symbol string in his I.3.,&lt;ref&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;600 in van Heijenoort&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the formalized inductive axiom appears as shown above – yet even this string can be "numeralized" using Gödel's method. On the other hand, he doesn't appear to use this axiom. Rather, his recursion steps through integers assigned to variable k (cf his (2) on page 602). His skeleton-proof of Theorem V, however, "use(s) induction on the degree of φ", and uses "the induction hypothesis". Without a full proof of this, we are left to assume that his use of the "induction hypothesis" is the intuitive version, not the symbolic axiom. His recursion simply steps up the degree of the functions, an intuitive act, ad infinitum. But Nagel and Newman note that Gödel's proofs are infinitary in nature,&lt;ref&gt;cf Nagel and Newman p.&amp;nbsp;98&lt;/ref&gt; not finitary as Hilbert requested (see [[Hilbert's second problem]]) while Gödel insisted that they are intuitionistically satisfactory. These are not incompatible truths, as long as the LoEM over the infinite isn't invoked anywhere in the proofs.

Despite the last-half-twentieth century's continued abstraction of mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Anglin says it this way: "In the twentieth century, there was a great deal of concrete, practical mathematics. ... On the other hand, much twentieth century mathematics was characterized by a degree of abstraction never seen before. It was not the Euclidean plane that was studied, but the vector spaces and topological spaces which are abstractions of it. It was not particular groups that were studied so much as the whole 'category' of groups." (Anglin 1994:217)&lt;/ref&gt; the issue has not entirely gone away. Here are two examples. First, the premises of an argument – even ones considered beyond questioning – are always fair game. A hard look at the premises of Turing's 1936–7 led Robin Gandy (1980) to propose his "principles for mechanisms" that throw in the speed of light as a constraint. Secondly, Breger (2000) in his "Tacit Knowledge and Mathematical Progress" delves deeply into the matter of "semantics versus syntax" – in his paper Hilbert, Poincaré, Frege, and Weyl duly make their appearances. He examines a core problem: in axiomatic proofs the tacit assumption of an experienced, thinking mind: to be successful it must come to the argument equipped with prior knowledge of the symbols and their use (the semantics behind the mindless syntax): "Mathematics as a purely formal system of symbols without a human being possessing the know-how for dealing with the symbols is impossible [according to the chemist Polanyi (1969, 195), the ideal of a form of knowledge that is strictly explicit is contradictory because without tacit knowledge all formulas, words, and illustrations would become meaningless]" (brackets in the original, Breger 2000:229).

==Kleene on Brouwer–Hilbert==

A serious study of this foundational controversy can be found in Stephen Kleene's ''Introduction to Metamathematics'', particularly in Chapter III: A critique of mathematical reasoning. He discusses §11. ''The paradoxes'', §12. ''First inferences from the paradoxes'' [impredicative definitions, Logicism etc.], §13. ''Intuitionism'', §14. ''Formalism'', §15. ''Formalization of a theory''.  Kleene takes the debate seriously, and throughout his book he actually builds the two "formal systems", e.g. on page 119 he shows those logical laws such as double negation that are disallowed in the intuitionist system.

'''CANpie''' (CAN Programming Interface Environment) is an [[open source]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} project and pursues the objective of creating and establishing an open and standardized software API for access to the [[CAN bus]].

[[Image:CANpieFD_Logo.png|right|thumb|300px|CANpie FD logo]]
The project was established in 2001&lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/projects/canpie/files/?source=navbar&lt;/ref&gt; by MicroControl and is licensed under [[Apache License|Apache License Version 2.0]]. The current version of the CANpie API&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microcontrol.net/download/canpie/canpie_user_v3r00.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; covers both classical CAN frames as well as [[CAN FD|ISO CAN FD]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.can-cia.org/fileadmin/resources/documents/proceedings/2012_hartwich.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; frames. The API is designed for embedded control applications as well as for PC interface boards: embedded [[microcontroller]]s are programmed in C, a C++ API is provided for OS independent access to interface boards. The API provides ISO/OSI Layer-2 (Data Link Layer) functionality. It is not the intention of CANpie to incorporate higher layer functionality (e.g. [[CANopen]], [[SAE J1939]]).

==Driver Principle==
The CANpie API supports the concept of hardware message buffers (mailboxes) with a total limit of 255 buffers. A message buffer has a unique direction (receive or transmit).  As an option it is possible to connect a [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] with arbitrary size to a message buffer for both transfer directions. The total number of CAN channels is limited to 255, the API provides a method to gather information about the features of each CAN hardware channel. This is especially important for an application designer who wants to write the code only once. The CAN frame time-stamping (specified by [[CAN in Automation|CiA]] 603, CAN Frame time-stamping – Requirements for network time management&lt;ref&gt;https://www.can-cia.org/standardization/specifications/&lt;/ref&gt;) is supported with a resolution of 1 nano-second.

==Usage==
[[Image:canpie_structure.png|right|thumb|300px|CANpie Structure]]
The following code snippet shows the initialisation of a microcontroller.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c" style="margin-right: 320px;"&gt;

#include "cp_core.h"  // CANpie core functions

void MyCanInit(void)
{
   CpPort_ts  tsCanPortT;   // logical CAN port
   //---------------------------------------------------
   // setup the CAN controller / open a physical CAN
   // port
   //
   memset(&amp;tsCanPortT, 0, sizeof(CpPort_ts));
   CpCoreDriverInit(eCP_CHANNEL_1, &amp;tsCanPortT, 0);
   //---------------------------------------------------
   // setup 500 kBit/s
   //
   CpCoreBitrate(&amp;tsCanPortT,
                 eCP_BITRATE_500K,
                 eCP_BITRATE_NONE);
   //---------------------------------------------------
   // start CAN operation
   //
   CpCoreCanMode(&amp;tsCanPortT, eCP_MODE_OPERATION);
   //.. now we are operational
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Similar projects==
For the [[Linux]] operating system the projects [[can4linux]] and [[SocketCAN]] provide support for Classical CAN and ISO CAN FD. The commercial [[Autosar|AUTOSAR]] specification supports CAN FD since version 4.3 and is available only for AUTOSAR partners. The CMSIS-Driver (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) specification is a software API that describes peripheral driver interfaces for middleware stacks and user applications on [[ARM architecture|ARM]] Cortex-M processors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-microcontroller-software-interface-standard.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Certified Forensic Computer Examiner''' (CFCE) credential was the first [[certification]] demonstrating competency in [[computer forensics]] in relation to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] based [[computers]]. The CFCE training and certification is conducted by the International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS), a non-profit, all-volunteer organization of digital forensic professionals.

==History==
IACIS was formed and commenced training in 1990.  The predecessor to the CFCE was the [[DOS]] Processing Certificate (DPC).  The CFCE was introduced in 1998 when the training was expanded to include examination of Windows-based computers.  The course materials also covers the MAC OS operating system and it's associated [[file systems]], however, the certificate only states proficiency in Windows.

==Eligibility==
In order to become a member of IACIS and undertake the CFCE previously a person must generally be a full-time member - sworn or unsworn - of a law enforcement agency, however this is no longer a requirement.  In some of those cases, a contract employee of a law enforcement agency or retired law enforcement officer may be eligible.  All IACIS members must sign agreement with the IACIS Code of Ethics.

==Certification process==
The certification process may be taken internally or externally and is conducted in two phases: Peer Review and Certification.

An internal certification candidate attends a 2-week training course given by IACIS.  Two courses are conducted annually. The US based course is conducted in the first half of the calendar year whilst the European-based course is conducted in the second half of the year. Upon successful completion of the course, the member is assigned a (volunteer) coach.  The coach guides the student through the Peer Review phase, often by suggesting reading materials or experiments for the student, which is intended to assist the student in fully understanding issues with which the student may be having difficulty. Upon successful completion of the Peer Review phase the candidate is eligible to enter the Certification phase which consists of a practical exam based on a hard drive examination and a final exam.

An external certification candidate does not attend the training, however they have to have the equivalent 72 hours of training that is comparable to the IACIS training.

==Recertification==
In order for certification to remain current, a member must undertake a proficiency test once per 3-year period after certification as well as complete 40 hours of continuing training in computer forensics or a related field. Additionally, the member must conduct as a minimum an average of 1 forensic examination per year, for a minimum of 3 examinations over the 3-year period. The member must also pay dues ($75 per year) and remain a member in good standing of IACIS.

==Recognition==
CFCE is one of the most widely recognized non-tool certifications in computer forensics for current and former law enforcement personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Ed |last= Tittel |date= Oct 1, 2015 |url= http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/computer-forensics-certifications,2-650-4.html |title= 4&amp;mdash;CFCE: Certified Forensic Computer Examiner |series= Best Computer Forensics Certifications For 2016 |work= Tom's IT Pro |publisher= Purch &lt;!-- hmm, [http://www.purch.com Purch], same people who bring you [[Tom's Hardware]] --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations such as the Computer Forensics Laboratory at Miami-Dade Police require their members to complete and maintain this certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/MDPD/fcls.asp |title=Digital Forensics |publisher=Miami-Dade |work=Police Department |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121214643/http://www.miamidade.gov/MDPD/fcls.asp |archivedate=January 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''core-excited shape resonance''' is a shape resonance in a system with more than one [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] where, after fragmentation, one of the fragments is in an excited state. It is sometimes very difficult to distinguish a core-excited shape resonance from a [[Feshbach resonance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6631">In botany, the '''correct name''' according to the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) is the one and only [[botanical name]] that is to be used for a particular [[taxon]], when that taxon has a particular [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]], position and [[Taxonomic rank|rank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; Determining whether a name is correct is a complex procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turland, N. |year=2013 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile Volume 155 |title=The Code Decoded: A user's guide to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants |publisher=Koeltz Scientific Books  |isbn=978-3-87429-433-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name must be '''validly published''', a process which is defined in no less than 16 Articles of the ICN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Article 6.2&lt;/ref&gt; It must also be "legitimate", which imposes some further requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Articles 6.3 and 6.4&lt;/ref&gt; If there are two or more legitimate names for the same taxon (with the same circumscription, position and rank), then the correct name is the one which has [[Priority (nomenclature)|priority]], i.e. it was published earliest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Principle III&lt;/ref&gt; although names may be [[Conserved name|conserved]] if they have been very widely used. Validly published names other than the correct name are called [[synonym (botany)|synonym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Article 7.2&lt;/ref&gt; Since taxonomists may disagree as to the circumscription, position or rank of a taxon, there can be more than one correct name for a particular plant. These may also be called synonyms.

The correct name has only one correct spelling, which will generally be the original spelling (although certain limited corrections are allowed). Other spellings are called [[orthographical variant (botany)|orthographical variants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Articles 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological]] equivalent of "correct name" is "[[valid name (zoology)|valid name]]".

==Example==
[[Image:Starr 070215-4478 Falcataria moluccana.jpg|thumb|Linnaeus' ''Adenanthera falcataria'' has many other names]]
Different taxonomic placements may well lead to different correct names. For example, the earliest name for the fastest growing tree in the world is ''[[Adenanthera falcataria]]'' [[Linnaeus|L.]] The "L." stands for "Linnaeus" who first validly published the name. ''Adenanthera falcataria'' is thus one of the correct names for this plant. There are other correct names, based on different taxonomic treatments.
* It can be placed in the genus ''[[Albizia]]'', as Fosberg first did. When placed in this genus, the first choice of correct name is the new genus name followed by the earlier species epithet, giving ''Albizia falcataria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Article 11.4&lt;/ref&gt; This name cannot be used if there is already a species  in the genus with this epithet, so that an illegitimate duplicate would be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Article 53&lt;/ref&gt; As this is not the case, the correct name for the plant in this genus is ''Albizia falcataria'' (L.) Fosberg. "Fosberg" is the authority for the transfer to the new genus; "L(innaeus)" the authority for the 'base name' ([[basionym]]) from which the new name is derived.
* It can also be placed in the genus ''[[Paraserianthes]]''. Its correct name in that position is ''Paraserianthes falcataria'' (L.) I.C.Nielsen. 
* Within the genus ''Paraserianthes'', it is placed in section ''Falcataria''. If the section is raised in rank to become the genus ''Falcataria'', the correct name cannot be ''Falcataria falcataria'', as might be expected, since under the botanical code (but not the zoological code) names with the same word as both the genus and the specific epithet ([[tautonym]]s) are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Article 23.4&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative basionym must be sought or a new name created. The correct name is ''[[Falcataria moluccana]]'' (Miq.) Barneby and J.W.Grimes.

The four names ''Adenanthera falcataria'', ''Albizia falcataria'', ''Paraserianthes falcataria'' and ''Falcataria moluccana'' are each correct, given that the plant is placed in these four genera. Which is the 'right' genus is a problem for taxonomy, not nomenclature. Thus this tree species will have a different correct botanical name for different people.

Cosmological horizons set the size and scale of the [[observable universe]]. This article explains a number of these horizons.

==Particle horizon==
{{main|Particle horizon}}
The '''particle horizon''' (also called the cosmological horizon, the comoving horizon, or the cosmic light horizon) is the maximum distance from which particles could have traveled to the observer in the age of the universe. It represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the universe, so its distance at the present epoch defines the size of the observable universe. Due to the expansion of the universe it is not simply the age of the universe times the speed of light, as in the Hubble horizon, but rather the speed of light multiplied by the conformal time. The existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular cosmological model.

In terms of comoving distance, the particle horizon is equal to the '''conformal time''' that has passed since the Big Bang, times the speed of light. In general, the conformal time at a certain time is given in terms of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; by,

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(t) = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{dt'}{a(t')}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\eta(a) = \int_{0}^{a} \frac{1}{a' H(a')} \frac{da'}{a'}&lt;/math&gt;.

The particle horizon is the boundary between two regions at a point at a given time: one region defined by events that have already been observed by an observer, and the other by events which cannot be observed ''at that time''. It represents the furthest distance from which we can retrieve information from the past, and so defines the observable universe.&lt;ref name="Berta" /&gt;

==Hubble horizon==

{{Main article|Hubble volume}}Hubble radius, Hubble sphere, Hubble volume, or Hubble horizon is a conceptual horizon defining the boundary between particles that are moving slower and faster than the speed of light relative to an observer at one given time. Note that this does not mean the particle is unobservable, the light from the past is reaching and will continue to reach the observer for a while. Also, more importantly, in the current expansion model e.g., light emitted from the Hubble radius will reach us in a finite amount of time. It is a common misconception that light from the Hubble radius can never reach us. It is true that particles on the Hubble radius recede from us with the speed of light, but the Hubble radius gets larger over time (because the Hubble parameter H gets smaller over time), so light emitted towards us from a particle on the Hubble radius will be inside the Hubble radius some time later. Only light emitted from the cosmic event horizon or further will never reach us in a finite amount of time.

The Hubble velocity of an object is given by Hubble's law,

:&lt;math&gt;v=x H&lt;/math&gt;.

Replacing &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with speed of light &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and solving for proper distance &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we obtain the radius of Hubble sphere as

:&lt;math&gt;r_{HS}(t)=\frac{c}{H(t)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In an ever-accelerating universe, if two particles are separated by a distance greater than the Hubble radius, they cannot talk to each other from now on (as they are now, not as they have been in the past), However, if they are outside of each other's particle horizon, they could have never communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Cosmology|last = Dodelson|first = Scott|publisher = [[Academic Press]]|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the form of expansion of the universe, they may be able to exchange information in the future. Today,

:&lt;math&gt;r_{HS}(t_0) = \frac{c}{H_0}&lt;/math&gt;,

yielding a Hubble horizon of some 4.1 Gpc. This horizon is not really a physical size, but it is often used as useful length scale as most physical sizes in cosmology can be written in terms of those factors.

One can also define comoving Hubble horizon by simply dividing Hubble radius by the scale factor

:&lt;math&gt;r_{HS, comoving}(t)=\frac{c}{a(t) H(t)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Event horizon==
{{main|Event horizon}}
The particle horizon differs from the cosmic [[event horizon]], in that the particle horizon represents the largest [[comoving distance]] from which light could have reached the observer by a specific time, while the event horizon is the largest comoving distance from which light emitted now can ''ever'' reach the observer in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Bergström and Ariel Goobar: "Cosmology and Particle Physics", ''WILEY'' (1999), page 65.{{ISBN|0-471-97041-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current distance to our cosmic event horizon is about 5 Gpc (16 billion light years), well within our observable range given by the particle horizon.&lt;ref name=ly93&gt;{{cite web|last = Lineweaver|first = Charles|author2=Tamara M. Davis|year = 2005|url = http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~charley/papers/LineweaverDavisSciAm.pdf|title = Misconceptions about the Big Bang|publisher = [[Scientific American]]|accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the proper distance to the event horizon at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref name="Giovannini"&gt;{{cite book|author=Massimo Giovannini|title=A primer on the physics of the cosmic microwave background|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ziIOYR1qZQC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=1 May 2011|year=2008|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-981-279-142-9|pages=70–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d_e(t) = a(t) \int_{t}^{t_{max}} \frac{cdt'}{a(t')}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is the time-coordinate of the end of the universe, which would be infinite in the case of a universe that expands forever.

For our case, assuming that [[dark energy]] is due to a [[cosmological constant]], &lt;math&gt;d_e(t_0) &lt; \infin&lt;/math&gt;.

==Future horizon==
In an [[accelerating universe]], there are events which will be unobservable as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infin&lt;/math&gt; as signals from future events become [[redshift]]ed to arbitrarily long wavelengths in the exponentially expanding [[de Sitter space]]. This sets a limit on the farthest distance that we can possibly see as measured in units of proper distance today. Or, more precisely, there are events that are [[spacelike|spatially separated]] for a certain frame of reference happening [[simultaneity|simultaneously]] with the event occurring right now for which no signal will ever reach us, even though we can observe events that occurred [[timelike|at the same location in space that happened in the distant past]]. While we will continue to receive signals from this location in space, even if we wait an infinite amount of time, a signal that left from that location today will never reach us. Additionally, the signals coming from that location will have less and less energy and be less and less frequent until the location, for all practical purposes, becomes unobservable. In a universe that is dominated by [[dark energy]] which is undergoing an exponential expansion of the [[cosmic scale factor|scale factor]], all objects that are [[Virial theorem#In astrophysics|gravitationally unbound]] with respect to the Milky Way will become unobservable, in a futuristic version of [[Jacobus Kapteyn|Kapteyn's universe]].&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0221&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical horizons==
While not technically "horizons" in the sense of an impossibility for observations due to relativity or cosmological solutions, there are practical horizons which include the optical horizon, set at the [[surface of last scattering]]. This is the farthest distance that any photon can freely stream. Similarly, there is a "neutrino horizon" set for the [[cosmic neutrino background|farthest distance a neutrino can freely stream]] and a gravitational wave horizon at the farthest distance that [[gravitational wave background|gravitational waves can freely stream]]. The latter is predicted to be a direct probe of the end of [[cosmic inflation]].

In a [[cave system]], the '''epiphreatic zone''' or the '''floodwater zone''' is the zone between [[vadose zone]] above it and [[phreatic zone]] beneath it. It is regularly flooded and has a significant [[porosity]]. It has a great potential for [[cave formation]].&lt;ref name="Prelovsek"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ung.si/~library/doktorati/krasoslovje/3Prelovsek.pdf |title=Present-Day Speleogenetic Processes, Factors and Features in the Epiphreatic Zone: Dissertation |first=Mitja |last=Prelovšek |year=2009 |publisher=University of Nova Gorica |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faculty of Sport and Tourism''' ({{lang-sr|Факултет за Спорт и Туризам, Fakultet za sport i turizam, TIMS}}) is a state-accredited private institution of high education located in [[Novi Sad]], [[Serbia]]. The Faculty was founded in 2004 and consists of three departments - Sport, Tourism and Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;http://prijemni.infostud.com/fakultet/Fakultet_za_sport_i_turizam-TIMS/189 TIMS article on Serbia's largest students' portal (in Serbian), retrieved on 11.5.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpn.gov.rs/ustanove/visoke.php#spisak Registry of institutions of higher education by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia (Private Institutions/Univerziteti/Univerzitet Metropolitan) retrieved on 11.5.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding, the Faculty has educated 209 [[Bachelor degree|bachelor]]s, 36 [[Magister (degree)|magisters]] and [[Master degree|masters]], as well as 10 [[Doctorate degree|doctors]].&lt;ref&gt;http://tims.edu.rs/en/timsworld/faculty&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
TIMS started off as an independent College for Sport Trainers and Managers ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Виша школа за тренере и менаџере у спорту / Viša škola za trenere i menadžere u sportu) in 2001, to grow into the Faculty of Sport and Tourism - TIMS, as it is known today, in 2004. That year also saw the addition of another department - Tourism, rendering TIMS the only faculty dedicated to sport and tourism in Serbia and the countries of former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mingl.org/karijera/obrazovanje/privatni_fakulteti.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301112335/http://www.mingl.org/karijera/obrazovanje/privatni_fakulteti.php |archivedate=2011-03-01 |df= }} Index of private faculties in Serbia on a high-school students' portal retrieved 11.5.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mingl.org/karijera/obrazovanje/drzavni_fakulteti.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308170618/http://www.mingl.org/karijera/obrazovanje/drzavni_fakulteti.php |archivedate=2011-03-08 |df= }} Index of state faculties in Serbia on a high-school students' portal retrieved 11.5.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yumreza.info/yumreza-2003/Obrazovanje....htm#Fakulteti_i_vise_skole,_univerziteti Directory of websites from the countries of former Yugoslavia, retrieved on 11.5.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cat fall 150x300 6fps.gif|thumb|upright|right|250px|A falling cat modeled as two independently rotating parts turns around while maintaining zero net angular momentum]]

The '''falling cat problem''' is a problem that consists of explaining the underlying [[physics]] behind the observation of the [[cat righting reflex]]: that is, how a free-falling body ([[cat]]) can change its orientation such that it is able to right itself as it falls to land on its feet, irrespective of its initial orientation, and without violating the law of [[conservation of angular momentum]].

Although amusing and trivial to pose, the solution of the problem is not as straightforward as its statement would suggest. The apparent contradiction with the law of conservation of angular momentum is resolved because the cat is not a [[rigid body]], but instead is permitted to change its shape during the fall owing to the cat's flexible [[vertebral column|backbone]] and non-functional [[collar-bone]]. The behavior of the cat is thus typical of the mechanics of [[deformable bodies]].

==History==
The falling cat problem has elicited interest from famous scientists including [[George Gabriel Stokes]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]. In a letter to his wife, Katherine Mary Clerk Maxwell, Maxwell wrote, "There is a tradition in Trinity that when I was here I discovered a method of throwing a cat so as not to light on its feet, and that I used to throw cats out of windows. I had to explain that the proper object of research was to find how quick the cat would turn round, and that the proper method was to let the cat drop on a table or bed from about two inches, and that even then the cat lights on her feet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Lewis|last2=Garnett|first2=William|title=The Life of James Clerk Maxwell|publisher=Macmillan and Company|isbn=978-1402161377|page=499|date=1999-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's and other scientists interest with so-called "cat turning" was reputed to have caused the death of many cats after being dropped from windows of multi-storied buildings.{{Citation needed|date = September 2015}} Maxwell in particular was interested in discovering the precise height that a cat needed to be dropped from so that the cat would be incapable of using [[cat righting reflex|its righting reflex]] to land on its feet, an endeavor in which he eventually succeeded.

Whereas the cat-falling problem was regarded as a mere curiosity by Maxwell, Stokes, and others, a more rigorous study of the problem was conducted by [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] who applied [[chronophotography]] to capture the cat's descent on film using a chronophotographic gun. The gun, capable of capturing 12 frames per second, produced images from which Marey deduced that, as the cat had no [[rotational motion]] at the start of its descent, the cat was not "cheating" by using the cat handler's hand as a [[Lever|fulcrum]]. This in itself posed a problem as it implied that it was possible for a body in free fall to acquire angular momentum. Marey also showed that [[air resistance]] played no role in facilitating the righting of the cat's body.

[[File:Falling cat 1894.jpg|thumb|310px|left|''[[Falling Cat]]'' – images which appeared in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1894, captured by a chronophotographic gun, a device of [[Étienne-Jules Marey|Marey's]] own invention. The editor of ''Nature'' wrote, "The expression of offended dignity shown by the cat at the end of the first series indicates a want of interest in scientific investigation."]]

His investigations were subsequently published in ''[[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|Comptes Rendus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marey|first1=É.J|title=Des mouvements que certains animaux exécutent pour retomber sur leurs pieds, lorsqu'ils sont précipités d'un lieu élevé|date=1894|volume=119|pages=714–717|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a summary of his findings were published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Photographs of a tumbling cat|journal=Nature|date=1894|volume=51|issue=1308|pages=80–81|bibcode = 1894Natur..51...80. |doi = 10.1038/051080a0 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 June 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The article's summary in ''Nature'' appeared thus:

{{Quotation| M. Marey thinks that it is the inertia of its own mass that the cat uses to right itself. The torsion couple which produces the action of the muscles of the vertebra acts at first on the forelegs which have a very small motion of inertia on account of the front feet being foreshortened and pressed against the neck. The hind legs, however, being stretched out and almost perpendicular to the axis of the body, possesses a moment of inertia which opposes motion in the opposite direction to that which the torsion couple tends to produce. In the second phase of the action, the attitude of the feet is reversed, and it is the inertia of the forepart that furnishes a fulcrum for the rotation of the rear.}}

Despite the publication of the images, many physicists at the time maintained that the cat was still "cheating" by using the handler's hand from its starting position to right itself, as the cat's motion would otherwise seem to imply a [[rigid body]] acquiring angular momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Donald|title=How does a cat fall on its feet?|agency=The New Scientist|date=30 June 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solution==
The solution of the problem, originally due to {{Harvp|Kane|Scher|1969}}, models the cat as a pair of cylinders (the front and back halves of the cat) capable of changing their relative orientations. {{harvtxt|Montgomery|1993}} later described the Kane&amp;ndash;Scher model in terms of a [[connection (principal bundle)|connection]] in the configuration space that encapsulates the relative motions of the two parts of the cat permitted by the physics.  Framed in this way, the dynamics of the falling cat problem is a prototypical example of a [[nonholonomic system]] {{harv|Batterman|2003}}, the study of which is among the central preoccupations of [[control theory]].  A solution of the falling cat problem is a curve in the configuration space that is ''horizontal'' with respect to the connection (that is, it is admissible by the physics) with prescribed initial and final configurations.  Finding an optimal solution is an example of optimal [[motion planning]] ({{harvnb|Arbyan|Tsai|1998}}; {{harvnb|Ge|Chen|2007}}).

In the language of physics, Montgomery's connection is a certain [[Yang-Mills field]] on the configuration space, and is a special case of a more general approach to the dynamics of deformable bodies as represented by [[gauge field]]s ({{harvnb|Montgomery|1993}}; {{harvnb|Batterman|2003}}), following the work of {{Harvp|Shapere|Wilczek|1987}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3366">'''Flatness''' in [[systems theory]] is a system property that extends the notion of [[controllability]] from [[LTI system theory|linear systems]] to [[Nonlinearity|nonlinear]] [[dynamical system]]s. A system that has the flatness property is called a ''flat system''. Flat systems have a (fictitious) ''flat output'', which can be used to explicitly express all states and inputs in terms of the flat output and a finite number of its derivatives.

== Definition ==
A nonlinear system

&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}(t),\mathbf{u}(t)), \quad \mathbf{x}(0) = \mathbf{x}_0, \quad \mathbf{u}(t) \in R^m, \quad \mathbf{x}(t) \in R^n, \text{Rank} \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})}{\partial\mathbf{u}} = m&lt;/math&gt;

is flat, if there exists an output

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = (y_1(t),...,y_m(t))&lt;/math&gt;

that satisfies the following conditions:

* The signals &lt;math&gt;y_i,i=1,...,m&lt;/math&gt; are representable as functions of the states &lt;math&gt;x_i,i=1,...,n&lt;/math&gt; and inputs &lt;math&gt;u_i,i=1,...,m&lt;/math&gt; and a finite number of derivatives with respect to time &lt;math&gt;u_i^{(k)}, k=1,...,\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} = \Phi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\dot{\mathbf{u}},...,\mathbf{u}^{(\alpha)})&lt;/math&gt;.
* The states &lt;math&gt;x_i,i=1,...,n&lt;/math&gt; and inputs &lt;math&gt;u_i,i=1,...,m&lt;/math&gt; are representable as functions of the outputs &lt;math&gt;y_i,i=1,...,m&lt;/math&gt; and of its derivatives with respect to time &lt;math&gt;y_i^{(k)}, i=1,...,m&lt;/math&gt;.
* The components of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; are differentially independent, that is, they satisfy no differential equation of the form &lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf{y},\dot{\mathbf{y}},\mathbf{y}^{(\gamma)}) = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

If these conditions are satisfied at least locally, then the (possibly fictitious) output is called ''flat output'', and the system is ''flat''.

== Relation to controllability of linear systems ==

A [[LTI system theory|linear system]] 
&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{B}\mathbf{u}(t), \quad \mathbf{x}(0) = \mathbf{x}_0&lt;/math&gt;
with the same signal dimensions for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; as the nonlinear system is flat, if and only if it is [[Controllability|controllable]]. For [[LTI system theory|linear systems]] both properties are equivalent, hence exchangeable.

== Significance ==
The flatness property is useful for both the analysis of and controller synthesis for nonlinear dynamical systems. It is particularly advantageous for solving trajectory planning problems and asymptotical setpoint following control.

'''Generalizability theory''', or '''G theory''', is a statistical framework for conceptualizing, investigating, and designing reliable [[observation]]s. It is used to determine the [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] (i.e., reproducibility) of measurements under specific conditions.  It is particularly useful for assessing the reliability of performance assessments. It was originally introduced in [[Lee Cronbach|Cronbach, L.J.]], Nageswari, R., &amp; Gleser, G.C. (1963).  

==Overview==
In G theory, sources of variation are referred to as ''facets''. Facets are similar to the "factors" used in [[analysis of variance]], and may include persons, raters, items/forms, time, and settings among other possibilities.  These facets are potential sources of error and the purpose of generalizability theory is to quantify the amount of error caused by each facet and interaction of facets.  The usefulness of data gained from a G study is crucially dependent on the design of the study.  Therefore, the researcher must carefully consider the ways in which he/she hopes to generalize any specific results.  Is it important to generalize from one setting to a larger number of settings? From one rater to a larger number of raters? From one set of items to a larger set of items? The answers to these questions will vary from one researcher to the next, and will drive the design of a G study in different ways. 

In addition to deciding which facets the researcher generally wishes to examine, it is necessary to determine which facet will serve as the object of measurement (e.g. the systematic source of variance) for the purpose of analysis. The remaining facets of interest are then considered to be sources of measurement error. In most cases, the object of measurement will be the person to whom a number/score is assigned.  In other cases it may be a group or performers such as a team or classroom. Ideally, nearly all of the measured variance will be attributed to the object of measurement (e.g. individual differences), with only a negligible amount of variance attributed to the remaining facets (e.g., rater, time, setting).

The results from a G study can also be used to inform a decision, or D, study. In a D study, we can ask the hypothetical question of "what would happen if different aspects of this study were altered?" For example, a soft drink company might be interested in assessing the quality of a new product through use of a consumer rating scale. By employing a D study, it would be possible to estimate how the consistency of quality ratings would change if consumers were asked 10 questions instead of 2, or if 1,000 consumers rated the soft drink instead of 100. By employing simulated D studies, it is therefore possible to examine how the generalizability coefficients (similar to reliability coefficients in [[Classical test theory]]) would change under different circumstances, and consequently determine the ideal conditions under which our measurements would be the most reliable.

==Comparison with classical test theory==
The focus of [[classical test theory]] (CTT) is on determining error of the measurement. Perhaps the most famous model of CTT is the equation &lt;math&gt;X = T + e&lt;/math&gt;, where X is the observed score, T is the true score, and e is the error involved in measurement. Although ''e'' could represent many different types of error, such as rater or instrument error, CTT only allows us to estimate one type of error at a time.  Essentially it throws all sources of error into one error term. This may be suitable in the context of highly controlled laboratory conditions, but variance is a part of everyday life. In field research, for example, it is unrealistic to expect that the conditions of measurement will remain constant. Generalizability theory acknowledges and allows for variability in assessment conditions that may affect measurements. The advantage of G theory lies in the fact that researchers can estimate what proportion of the total variance in the results is due to the individual factors that often vary in assessment, such as setting, time, items, and raters.  

Another important difference between CTT and G theory is that the latter approach takes into account how the consistency of outcomes may change if a measure is used to make absolute versus relative decisions. An example of an absolute, or criterion-referenced, decision would be when an individual's test score is compared to a cut-off score to determine eligibility or diagnosis (i.e. a child's score on an achievement test is used to determine eligibility for a gifted program). In contrast, an example of a relative, or norm-referenced, decision would be when the individual's test score is used to either (a) determine relative standing as compared to his/her peers (i.e. a child's score on a reading subtest is used to determine which reading group he/she is placed in), or (b) make intra-individual comparisons (i.e. comparing previous versus current performance within the same individual). The type of decision that the researcher is interested in will determine which formula should be used to calculate the generalizability coefficient (similar to a reliability coefficient in CTT).

Readers interested in learning more about G theory are encouraged to seek out publications by Brennan (2001), Chiu (2001), and/or Shavelson and Webb (1991).

A '''gulf''' is a large inlet from the ocean into the landmass, typically with a narrower opening than a [[bay (geography)|bay]]; though this is not observable in all geographic areas so named. The term gulf was traditionally used for large, highly indented, navigable bodies of salt water which are enclosed by the coastline.&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences - Volume 2 George Gregory - 1816 -  sea is a smaller collection of waters; as the Black Sea. A gulf is a part of the sea which is nearly surrounded with land; as the gulf of Venice. A bay has a wider entrance than a gulf; as the Bay of Biscay. A strait is a narrow passage that joins ."&lt;/ref&gt; Many gulfs are major shipping areas, such as the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Gulf of Aden]].&lt;ref&gt;Gita Duggal &amp; Baruna Ray Chowdhury - Madhubun ICSE Geography  932599464X – 6 - Page 32 "A gulf is an inlet of an ocean or a sea deep into the land with a narrow mouth. It is more highly indented, more enclosed by the coast and larger than a bay. Some examples of gulfs are Persian Gulf, Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Eden and Gulf of ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HomoloGene''', a tool of the United States [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI), is a system for automated detection of [[homology (biology)|homologs]] (similarity attributable to descent from a common ancestor) among the annotated genes of several completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes.

The HomoloGene processing consists of the protein analysis from the input organisms. Sequences are compared using blastp, then matched up and put into groups, using a taxonomic tree built from sequence similarity, where closer related organisms are matched up first, and then further organisms are added to the tree. The protein alignments are mapped back to their corresponding DNA sequences, and then distance metrics as molecular distances [[Substitution model|Jukes and Cantor (1969)]], [[Ka/Ks ratio]] can be calculated.

The sequences are matched up by using a [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic algorithm]] for maximizing the score globally, rather than locally, in a bipartite matching (see [[complete bipartite graph]]). And then it calculates the statistical significance of each match. Cutoffs are made per position and Ks values are set to prevent false [[Ortholog|"orthologs"]] from being grouped together. [[Homology (biology)|“Paralogs”]] are identified by finding sequences that are closer within species than other species.

==Input organisms==

===[[Metazoa]]===

====[[Vertebrates]]====
''[[Homo sapiens]], [[Pan troglodytes]], [[Mus musculus]], [[Rattus norvegicus]], [[Canis lupus familiaris]], [[Bos taurus]], [[Gallus gallus]], [[Xenopus tropicalis]], [[Danio rerio]]"

====[[Invertebrates]]====
"[[Drosophila melanogaster]], [[Anopheles gambiae]], [[Caenorhabditis elegans]]"

===[[Fungi]]===
"[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]], [[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]], [[Kluyveromyces lactis]], [[Eremothecium gossypii]], [[Magnaporthe grisea]],  [[Neurospora crassa]]"

===[[Plants]]===

====[[Dicots]]====
"[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]"

====[[Monocots]]====
"[[Oryza sativa]]"

===[[Protista]]===
"[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''.

==Interface==
The HomoloGene is linked to all Entrez databases and based on homology and phenotype information of these links: 
* [[Mouse Genome Informatics]] (MGI), 
* [[Zebrafish Information Network]] (ZFIN),
* [[Saccharomyces Genome Database]] (SGD), 
* Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG),
* [[FlyBase]],
* [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] (OMIM)

As a result, HomoloGene displays information about Genes, Proteins, Phenotypes, and Conserved Domains.

[[Indium phosphide]]-based [[photonic integrated circuits]], or PICs, commonly use alloys of {{Gallium}}&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;{{Indium}}&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;{{Arsenic}}&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;{{Phosphorus}}&lt;sub&gt;1−y&lt;/sub&gt; to construct [[quantum well]]s, [[waveguides]] and other photonic structures, lattice matched to an InP substrate, enabling single-crystal epitaxial growth onto InP.

Many devices operating in the [[near-infrared]] 1.55&amp;nbsp;μm wavelength window utilize this alloy, and are employed as optical components (such as [[laser]] transmitters, [[photodetectors]] and modulators) in [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] communications systems.

'''Information access''' is the freedom or ability to identify, obtain and make use of [[Data|data]] or information effectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Information Access." Computer Sciences. . Encyclopedia.com. 28 Feb. 2017 &lt;http://www.encyclopedia.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various research efforts in information access which objective is to simplify and make it more effective for human users to access and further process large and unwieldy amounts of data and [[information]].A person who is searching for information uses a search engine to achieve their information hunt. These searches for information can be of a wide range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/10/node4.html | title=Modern Information Retrieval}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several technologies applicable to the general area are [[Information Retrieval]], [[Text mining|Text Mining]], [[Machine Translation]], and [[text categorisation|Text Categorisation]].

During discussions on free access to information as well as on [[information policy]], information access is understood as concerning the insurance of free and closed access to [[information]]. Information access covers many issues including [[copyright]], [[Open-source model|open source]], [[privacy]], and [[security]].

Groups such as the [[American Library Association]], the [http://www.aallnet.org American Association of Law Libraries], [[Ralph Nader]]'s [http://www.tap.org Taxpayers Assets Project] have advocated for free access to [[Legal research|legal information]]. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20050403183057/http://www.aallnet.org/committee/citation/ vendor neutral citation] movement in the [[legal]] field is working to ensure that courts will accept [[Case citation|citations]] from cases on the web which do not have the traditional (copyrighted) page numbers from the [[West Publishing]] company.  There is a worldwide [[Free Access to Law Movement]] which advocates free access to legal information. The Wired Magazine Article [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.05/the.law.html Who Owns The Law] is an introduction to the access to legal information issue. Postsecondary organizations such as K-12 work to share information. They feel it is a legal and moral obligation to provide access (including to people with disabilities or impairments) to information through the services and programs they offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/information-access-0|title=Information Access {{!}} DO-IT|website=www.washington.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19546">The''' Institute for Economics &amp; Peace''' ('''IEP'''), is a global [[think tank]] headquartered in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] with branches in [[New York City]], [[Mexico City]] and [[The Hague]]. The IEP is  chaired by technology entrepreneur  [[Steve Killelea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uncnews.unc.edu/2015/10/01/founder-and-executive-chair-of-the-institute-for-economics-and-peace-steve-killelea-speaks-about-the-global-peace-index-oct-2/|title=Founder and executive chair of the Institute for Economics and Peace Steve Killelea speaks about the Global Peace Index, Oct. 2|last=VanGraafeil|first=Mc|date=2015-10-01|website=UNC News|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; founder of Integrated Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ir.com/team/steve-killelea|title=Steve Killelea|last=IR.com|website=www.ir.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
IEP is dedicated to shifting the world's focus to peace as a positive, achievable, and tangible measure of human well-being and progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jubitz.org/peace|title=Peacebuilding|website=jubitz.org|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It achieves its goals by developing global and national peace indices, calculating the ''economic cost of violence'', analysing country level risk and understanding the conditions which underpin highly peaceful societies - ''Positive Peace''.

IEP produce frameworks to define peacefulness, providing metrics for measurement, uncovering the relationship between peace, business, and prosperity, and by promoting a better understanding of the cultural, economic, and political factors that drive peacefulness.

=== Partners ===
IEP works in partnership with a number of think tanks, NGOs and academic institutions including the [[Aspen Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Aspen Institute Business and Society Program| url = http://www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/business-society| accessdate =2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csis.org/events/global-peace-index-2017-launch|title=The Global Peace Index 2017 Launch|website=csis.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Peace Institute]], [[Open Society Foundations]], and [[King's College London]]. It also collaborates with intergovernmental organizations such as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/crisis-prevention-and-recovery/development-of-goal-and-purpose-indicators-for-undp.html|title=Development of Goal and Purpose Indicators for UNDP|website=undo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]], [[NATO]], the [[World Bank Group]], and [[UN Peacebuilding Support Office]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/peacebuilding/pbso&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, IEP has been an active member of the [[United Nations Global Compact|UN Global Compact]] Expert Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/66591-Institute-for-Economics-and-Peace-|title=Institute for Economics and Peace  {{!}} UN Global Compact|website=www.unglobalcompact.org|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Responsible Business and Investment in High-Risk Areas.

IEP has a strategic partnership with [[Rotary International]] and [[One Young World]], which involves training of Global Peace Index Ambassadors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://my.rotary.org/en/news-media/rotary-peace-fellows-win-competition-spread-peace|title=Rotary Peace Fellows win competition to spread peace {{!}} My Rotary|website=my.rotary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the program focuses on engaging young leaders in understanding IEP’s empirical peace research.

IEP is also a member of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goal]] 16 Data Initiative, which is a consortium that compiles existing global data to assist in tracking progress towards achieving Goal 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prio.org/Events/Event/?x=8438|title=Measuring Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies: Launch of the SDG16 Data Initiative|last=(PRIO)|first=Peace Pesearch Institute Oslo|website=www.prio.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Peace Index ==
The core asset of the IEP is the [[Global Peace Index]] (GPI), which is now considered the benchmark study in measuring peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-40118188|title=Global Peace Index 2017: World 0.28% more peaceful than last year|last=|first=|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/events/measuring-and-understanding-peace|title=Measuring and Understanding Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPI has been recognized by leading analysts and institutions, and has been incorporated into reports such as the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]'s Year Book (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Appendix 2B.

The data for the GPI is collected and collated in collaboration with the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] (EIU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Detailed information can be found from | url= http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=corporate_landing_united_nations&amp;rf=0| accessdate =2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the research and analysis arm of the [[Economist Group]], and the methodology is informed and reviewed each year by an international panel of peace and statistics experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Peaceful Nations|publisher= Alliance for Peacebuilding |url= http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/documents/GSPNPeacefulNationsReportFinal_001.pdf| accessdate =2010-04-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPI is released annually with presentations typically held in [[London]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Geneva]], [[Paris]], [[New York City]], [[Sydney]], [[Brussels]] and [[The Hague]].

The GPI is used by various international organizations, such as the [[United Nations|UN]] and [[World bank|World Bank]] as a source of data and information as well as being used by academics and universities around the world.

In addition, the GPI was the empirical basis for the Symposium of Peaceful Nations, a 3-day conference hosted in November 2009 to honor the most peaceful countries in each of nine regions of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/documents/GSPNPeacefulNationsReportFinal_001.pdf|title=Symposium of Peaceful Nations|accessdate=2010-04-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which [[Helen Clark]], UNDP Administrator, delivered the keynote address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2009/november/helen-clark-statement-at-the-global-symposium-of-peaceful-nations.en|title=Helen Clark: Statement at the Global Symposium of Peaceful Nations|accessdate=2010-04-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228165855/http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2009/november/helen-clark-statement-at-the-global-symposium-of-peaceful-nations.en|archivedate=2010-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Economics &amp; Peace, in 2016, marked 10 years of measuring and analysing global levels of peace. In celebration of this milestone, IEP along with the Diplomatic Courier Magazine hosted the Future of Peace Summit in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/event/2016/06/future-of-peace-summit/|title=Future of Peace Summit|work=Alliance for Peacebuilding|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th annual GPI launched in June 2017 includes 163 countries in the world, and the interactive map on [http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/ the website] explains the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/global-peace-index-us-middle-east-relations-donald-trump-syria-politics-iran-a7766561.html|title=Last year there were 10 countries in the world entirely free from war.

The 2017 GPI recorded a small improvement in average global peace, with 93 countries recording higher levels of peace and 68 recording a deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australian_outlook/global-peace-17/|title=The Status of World Peace May Surprise You|work=Australian Institute of International Affairs|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Peace Indices==
IEP has also launched a series of National Peace Indices. The first one was the United States Peace Index ([[United States Peace Index|USPI]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/us-peace-index/|title=US Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2011. The USPI ranks each state in the US by peacefulness and, unlike the [[Global Peace Index|GPI]], uses only 5 indicators: incarceration rate, the number of police officers, the number of homicides, the availability of small arms, and the number of violent crimes. In 2011 Maine was ranked the most peaceful state, while Louisiana was the least peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/our-uspi-findings&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/03/UK-Peace-Index-report-2013.pdf UK Peace Index] was conducted in 2013. The UK Peace Index provides a comprehensive measure of the levels of peacefulness within the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2012.

The [[Mexico Peace Index]] ([[Mexico Peace Index|MPI]]) is the latest in the series of National Peace Indices. There have been 4 editions of the MPI to date, the first published in 2013, and most recently 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/mexico-peace-index/|title=Mexico Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPI uses five indicators to gauge the level of peace in the 32 Mexican states from 2003-2016. The indicators are: ''Homicide rates, violent crime, detention without a sentence, weapons crime'' and ''organised crime''.

An expert panel is engaged to provide independent advice and technical guidance in developing the methodology, these experts are from independent, non-partisan, civil society and academic organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/mexico-peace-index/|title=Mexico Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 MPI found that peacefulness deteriorated by 4.3% in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mexicoinstitute.wordpress.com/2017/04/05/institute-for-economics-and-peace-releases-2017-mexico-peace-index/|title=Institute for Economics and Peace releases 2017 Mexico Peace Index|last=mexicoinstitute|date=2017-04-05|website=Mexico Institute|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the homicide rate rose by 18.4% in the same year. Yucatán is the most peaceful state in Mexico, while Guerrero is the least peaceful state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/peace-index-registers-first-decline-in-5-years/|title=Mexico Peace Index registers first decline in 5 years|date=2017-04-05|work=Mexico News Daily|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data used to calculate the MPI comes from government bodies in Mexico, and IEP uses survey data collection by the national statistical office to adjust the figures for under reporting.

==Global Terrorism Index==
Another flagship report of the IEP is the [[Global Terrorism Index]] ([[Global Terrorism Index|GTI]]) which provides a comprehensive summary of the key global trends and patterns in terrorism. The report analyses data spanning the past 16 years and four editions having been released to date.

The GTI is based on data from the [[Global Terrorism Database|Global Terrorism Database (GTD)]]. It ranks 163 countries based on four indicators, those indicators are; ''number of terrorist incidents in a given year, number of fatalities from terrorist incidents in a given year, number of injuries caused by terrorist in a given year'' and ''measure of the total property damage from terrorist incidents in a given year.''

The 2016 GTI report found a ten per cent decrease in the number of deaths from terrorism in 2015 resulted in 3,389 fewer deaths than 2014, a global total of 29,376 deaths made 2015 the second deadliest year on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/world/global-terrorism-report/index.html|title=Terror attacks in developed world surge 650% in one year|last=CNN|first=Kara Fox and Dave Gilbert|website=CNN|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Economic Value of Peace ==
The [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/The-Economic-Value-of-Peace-2016-WEB.pdf Economic Value of Peace report] estimates of the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy.

It provides an empirical basis to calculate the potential additional economic benefits from improvements in peace. It estimates the economic impact of violence for 163 countries and independent territories representing 99.5 per cent of the global economy and population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy/|title=How much does violence really cost our global economy?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] in 2016, equivalent to 12.6% of global GDP, or $1,953 per person, this figure represented the first decline in the economic impact of violence since 2011, which is the year that corresponded with the start of the Syrian war and ISIL's territorial gains in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-peace-index-idUSKBN0OX0AU20150617|title=Cost of violence hits $14 trillion in increasingly divided world|date=2015-06-17|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Peace Report==
On October 26, 2010, IEP and Peace and Media Tenor released “Measuring Peace in the Media”, the first study that takes a fact-based approach into understanding the accuracy of international television networks’ coverage of peace, violence and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/info-center/measuring-peace-in-the-media/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107121303/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/info-center/measuring-peace-in-the-media/# |archive-date=2011-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results show broad inconsistencies across geographies and networks, with US broadcasters much more focused on violence and conflict than their European and Middle Eastern counterparts. Al Jazeera was found to be the network providing the most balanced coverage on Afghanistan. BBC World led the way when it came to breadth of coverage. It regularly reported on 67 countries across six continents which is nearly twice as many countries as the average level of coverage.

The study analysed 37 TV news and current affairs programmes from 23 networks in 15 countries* and then cross-referenced this with the Global Peace Index which measures the levels of peace and violence in 149 countries. BBC 2 Newsnight and ZDF Heute Journal (Germany) were found to be the programmes whose editorial policies aligned their coverage most closely with the rankings of the GPI.

Positive-peace stories make up just 1.6% of the total number of stories examined in the study. These are stories that report on active steps taken to rectify violent situations. Such a small percentage may be partly related to what is considered newsworthy and dramatic, such as high-impact, violent or controversial events. However, the stereotyping of nations which are low on the GPI makes it harder for audiences to gain empathy and therefore to support governments and make headway towards creating peace.

== Positive Peace ==
Positive Peace is an innovative and empirically based framework which has been developed by IEP to identify and understand the factors which are statistically associated with peaceful and resilient societies. Positive Peace is measured by IEP on the [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/Positive-Peace-Report-2016.pdf Positive Peace Index (PPI)].

While the Global Peace Index measures 'Negative Peace' being the absence of violence or fear of violence, Positive Peace represents the capacity for a society to meet the needs of its citizens, reduce and deal with grievances without the use of violence.

The framework is based on the quantitatively identifiable common characteristics of the world's most peaceful societies.

The defining feature of IEP’s Positive Peace framework is the [[systems approach]] to peace. IEP research has demonstrated that high levels of peacefulness are associated with strength in not just one, but all eight factors of Positive Peace. All domains are highly interrelated and work together systemically in producing a peaceful society.

== Reception ==
The [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=think_tanks Global Go To Think Tank Index] listed the Institute for Economics and Peace as a "Think Tank to Watch", and as one of the top 20 most impactful Think Tanks worldwide with a Budget under $5 Million.

In 2013, Steve Killelea’s founding of IEP was recognized as one of the 50 most impactful philanthropic gifts in Australia’s history by a coalition including the Myer Family Company, [[Myer Foundation|The Myer Foundation]] and Sidney Myer Fund, Pro Bono Australia, [[Swinburne University]] and Philanthropy Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2013/10/australia%E2%80%99s-top-50-philanthropic-gifts-all-time#sthash.HlK828IS.dpuf|title=Australia’s Top 50 Philanthropic Gifts of All Time|date=2013-10-14|publisher=ProBono Australia|accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Jacques Dozy''' (18 June 1908, in [[Rotterdam]] – 1 November 2004, in [[The Hague]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[geologist]].

In 1936, he participated in the Dutch [[Carstensz Expedition]] in [[Dutch New Guinea]] to explore and  climb [[Mount Carstensz]], the highest mountain of the island of [[New Guinea]]. Besides succeeding in climbing the [[Ngga Pulu|highest point at the time]] with [[Anton Colijn]] and Frits Wissel, Dozy discovered the presence of abundant copper ore in a mountain he called Ertsberg (English, "Ore mountain"). Years later this gave rise to the [[Grasberg mine|Grasberg copper mine]]. In 1939, he published an article about his find, but it was neglected due to [[World War II]]. Twenty years later, the article led to rediscovery of the Ertsberg and the development of the Ertsberg-Grasberg mine complex.

[[Essential oil]]s are [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] and liquid [[aroma compound]]s from natural sources, usually plants. They are not oils in a strict sense, but often share with oils a poor [[solubility]] in water. Essential oils often have an odor and are therefore used in [[food flavoring]] and [[perfumery]]. They are usually prepared by [[fragrance extraction]] techniques (such as [[distillation]], [[cold pressing]], or [[Solvent extraction]]). Essential oils are distinguished from [[aroma oil]]s (essential oils and aroma compounds in an oily [[solvent]]), [[infusion]]s in a vegetable oil, [[absolute (fragrance)|absolute]]s, and [[concrete (perfumery)|concrete]]s. Typically, essential oils are highly complex mixtures of often hundreds of individual aroma compounds.

==Discrete distributions==

[[Image:Binomial distribution pmf.svg|thumb|[[Binomial distribution]]]]
[[Image:Degenerate distribution PMF.png|thumb|[[Degenerate distribution]]]]

===With finite [[Support (mathematics)|support]]===
* The [[Bernoulli distribution]], which takes value 1 with probability ''p'' and value 0 with probability ''q'' = 1 &amp;minus; ''p''.
* The [[Rademacher distribution]], which takes value 1 with probability 1/2 and value &amp;minus;1 with probability 1/2.
* The [[binomial distribution]], which describes the number of successes in a series of independent Yes/No experiments all with the same probability of success.
* The [[beta-binomial distribution]], which describes the number of successes in a series of independent Yes/No experiments with heterogeneity in the success probability.
* The [[degenerate distribution]] at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''X'' is certain to take the value ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This does not look random, but it satisfies the definition of [[random variable]]. This is useful because it puts deterministic variables and random variables in the same formalism.
* The [[discrete uniform distribution]], where all elements of a finite [[set theory|set]] are equally likely. This is the theoretical distribution model for a balanced coin, an unbiased die, a casino roulette, or the first card of a well-shuffled deck.
* The [[hypergeometric distribution]], which describes the number of successes in the first ''m'' of a series of ''n'' consecutive Yes/No experiments, if the total number of successes is known. This distribution arises when there is no replacement.
* The [[Poisson binomial distribution]], which describes the number of successes in a series of independent Yes/No experiments with different success probabilities.
*[[Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution]]
*[[Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution]]
*[[Benford's law]], which describes the frequency of the first digit of many naturally occurring data.
* The ideal and robust [[soliton distribution | soliton distributions]].

===With infinite support===
* The [[beta negative binomial distribution]]
* The [[Boltzmann distribution]], a discrete distribution important in [[statistical physics]] which describes the probabilities of the various discrete energy levels of a system in [[thermal equilibrium]]. It has a continuous analogue. Special cases include:
** The [[Gibbs distribution]]
** The [[Maxwell&amp;ndash;Boltzmann distribution]]
* The [[Borel distribution]]
* The [[extended negative binomial distribution]]
* The [[extended hypergeometric distribution]]
* The generalized log-series distribution
* The [[geometric distribution]], a discrete distribution which describes the number of attempts needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials, or alternatively only the number of losses before the first success (i.e. one less).
* The [[logarithmic distribution|logarithmic (series) distribution]]
* The [[negative binomial distribution]] or Pascal distribution, a generalization of the geometric distribution to the ''n''th success.
* The discrete [[compound Poisson distribution]]
* The [[parabolic fractal distribution]]
* The [[Poisson distribution]], which describes a very large number of individually unlikely events that happen in a certain time interval. Related to this distribution are a number of other distributions: the [[displaced Poisson distribution|displaced Poisson]], the hyper-Poisson, the general Poisson binomial and the Poisson type distributions. 
** The [[Conway&amp;ndash;Maxwell&amp;ndash;Poisson distribution]], a two-parameter extension of the [[Poisson distribution]] with an adjustable rate of decay.
** The [[Zero-truncated Poisson distribution]], for processes in which zero counts are not observed
* The [[Polya–Eggenberger distribution]]
* The [[Skellam distribution]], the distribution of the difference between two independent Poisson-distributed random variables.
* The [[skew elliptical distribution]]
* The [[Yule–Simon distribution]]
* The [[zeta distribution]] has uses in applied statistics and statistical mechanics, and perhaps may be of interest to number theorists. It is the [[Zipf distribution]] for an infinite number of elements.
* [[Zipf's law]] or the Zipf distribution. A discrete [[power law|power-law]] distribution, the most famous example of which is the description of the frequency of words in the English language.
* The [[Zipf–Mandelbrot law]] is a discrete power law distribution which is a generalization of the [[Zipf distribution]].

'''Madhu Bai''' '''Kinnar''' is a [[transgender]] mayor in [[Chhattisgarh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/now-a-trans-gender-mayor-meet-madhu-kinnar-643926 | title=Now, a Trans-Gender Mayor. Meet Madhu Kinnar | accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Running as an independent candidate, Madhu won the mayor election of the [[Raigarh Municipal Corporation]], securing 33,168 votes and defeating the nearest rival, the ruling party [[BJP]]'s Mahaveer Guruji, by 4,537 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cg.nic.in/raigarh/raigarhvoting.htm | title=Election Results | publisher=Chhattisgarh State Election Commission | accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prior to elections ==
Madhu Bai was previously known as Naresh Chauhan and has an eighth-grade education. As a teenager, Madhu left her family to join the local transgender community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/03/india-first-transgender-mayor-overcoming-prejudice-hijra|title=India's transgender mayor – is the country finally overcoming prejudice?|last=Raigarh|first=Eesha Patkar in|date=2015-03-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She belongs to the [[Dalit]] community in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://time.com/3656348/india-transgender-mayor/ | title=India's First Openly Transgender Mayor Elected | date=6 January 2015 | work=Time | first=Charlotte | last=Alter | accessdate=29 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before assuming office, Madhu Bai earned a living by taking up odd jobs and by singing and dancing on the streets of Raigarh and performing in trains going on the Howrah-Mumbai route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/03/india-first-transgender-mayor-overcoming-prejudice-hijra|title=India's transgender mayor – is the country finally overcoming prejudice?|last=Raigarh|first=Eesha Patkar in|date=2015-03-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebetterindia.com/17912/india-first-transgender-mayor-meet-madhu-kinnar-raigarh/|title=From Dancing On Trains To Becoming India’s First Transgender Mayor: Meet Madhu Kinnar|date=2015-01-06|work=The Better India|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She ran for mayor's office on a budget of 60,000 to 70,000 rupees, saying that it was upon the insistence of a few aggrieved citizens that she decided to contest the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/hopeful-signs-for-rights-as-indias-first-openly-transgender-mayor-takes-office/2591652.html|title=India’s First Openly Transgender Mayor Takes Office, Fueling Hope for Rights|last=Rahman|first=Shaikh Azizur|work=VOA|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Madhu, [[Kamla Jan]] was elected the first transgender mayor of India in [[Katni]]. Her candidacy was declared "void" because she contested in the female category.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/03/india-first-transgender-mayor-overcoming-prejudice-hijra|title=India's transgender mayor – is the country finally overcoming prejudice?|last=Raigarh|first=Eesha Patkar in|date=2015-03-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In politics ==
Madhu Kinnar wishes to work as an independent leader, as opposed to joining a political party. Her electoral victory on 4 January 2015, came about nine months after the Supreme Court [[NALSA v UOI|NALSA]] verdict, which gave legal recognition to transgender people in India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebetterindia.com/17912/india-first-transgender-mayor-meet-madhu-kinnar-raigarh/|title=From Dancing On Trains To Becoming India’s First Transgender Mayor: Meet Madhu Kinnar|date=2015-01-06|work=The Better India|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first meeting of the Raigarh Municipal Corporation, [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and BJP members staged a walkout, resulting in the meeting being postponed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/raipur/cong-bjp-prevail-over-madhu-kinnar-at-maiden-meet.html|title=Cong, BJP prevail over Madhu Kinnar at maiden meet|last=Pioneer|first=The|work=The Pioneer|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A crucial part of her agenda has been sanitation. In an interview with [[The Guardian]], she states that, "“There were no proper sidewalks. The alleys were dirty and piled high with garbage. Poor people, abandoned in their old age, slept in the streets with nothing to keep them warm. We decided to do something – by running for this election.” Some of her constituents have also suggested that she take up the cleaning and filling up of lakes and ponds, as well as creating small parks and gardens. She will also be working in re-routing truck traffic to the outer roads of the city.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[general relativity]], '''Newtonian gauge''' is a perturbed form of the [[FLRW metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker line element]]. The [[gauge theory|gauge freedom]] of general relativity is used to eliminate two scalar degrees of freedom of the metric, so that it can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 =-(1+2\Psi)dt^2+a^2(t)(1-2\Phi)\delta_{ab}dx^adx^b,&lt;/math&gt;
where the Latin indices ''a'' and ''b'' are summed over the ''spatial'' directions and &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]]. '''Conformal Newtonian gauge''' is the closely related gauge in which
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 =a^2(\tau)[-(1+2\Psi)d\tau^2+(1-2\Phi)\delta_{ab}dx^adx^b]&lt;/math&gt;
which is related by the simple transformation &lt;math&gt;dt=a(t)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;. These metrics are perturbed forms of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]]. They are called Newtonian gauge because &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is the Newtonian [[gravitational potential]] of classical Newtonian [[gravity]], which satisfies the [[Poisson equation]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\Psi=4\pi G\rho&lt;/math&gt; for non-relativistic matter and on scales where the expansion of the universe may be neglected. It includes only [[scalar field|scalar]] perturbations of the metric: by the [[scalar-vector-tensor decomposition]] these evolve independently of the [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] and [[tensor]] perturbations and are the predominant ones affecting the growth of structure in the universe in [[cosmological perturbation theory]]. The vector perturbations vanish in [[cosmic inflation]] and the tensor perturbations are [[gravitational waves]], which have a negligible effect on physics except for the so-called B-modes of the [[cosmic microwave background]] [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]. The tensor perturbation is truly gauge independent, since it is the same in all gauges.

In a universe without anisotropic stress (that is, where the [[stress–energy tensor]] is invariant under spatial rotations, or the three principal pressures are identical) the [[Einstein equation]] sets &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\Psi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Silas C. Overpack''' (1841–1927) was a blacksmith, wheelwright, and businessman. He owned a shop (around 1868) in downtown [[Manistee, Michigan]], at 87 Pine Street, called ''S.C. Overpack Wagon, Carriage and Blacksmith Shop'' and is associated with the invention of [[Michigan logging wheels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.state.mi.us/history/museum/explore/museums/hismus/prehist/lumber/overpack.html Lumbering in Michigan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606153722/http://www.sos.state.mi.us/history/museum/explore/museums/hismus/prehist/lumber/overpack.html |date=June 6, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These unusually large wagon wheels (10 feet in diameter) were used in the timber industry for hauling logs in difficult terrain. &lt;ref name="Overpack"&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty&amp;cc=micounty&amp;idno=bac9250.0002.001&amp;frm=frameset&amp;view=image&amp;seq=195 Powers, Perry F., ''A history of northern Michigan and its people'' - Biography of Silas C. Overpack].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early childhood ==
Silas Overpack was born in Chemung County, Pennsylvania, on March 20, 1841. He was the sixth of ten children. He spent his childhood there where he received his public schooling. His parents were George and Remercy (Chidester) Overpack. They left Pennsylvania around 1850 and ultimately settled in [[Springfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan]], where George rests in the Andersonville Cemetery, Andersonville, Michigan.  Remercy and a number of her descendants are interred in the Oak Grove Cemetery, Manistee, Michigan.&lt;ref name="Overpack" /&gt;

== Career ==
Shortly after arriving in Michigan, Overpack entered into apprenticeship of learning the [[wagon]]-making trade. In 1868 he moved to [[Manistee, Michigan|Manistee]] and set up a blacksmith and wagon making business downtown. There he made wagons and [[sleigh]]s for the thriving [[lumber industry]] of [[northern Michigan]]. He also sold salt, mill carts, blankets, harnesses, whips, and ropes. He usually employed anywhere from twelve to fifteen people at any one time.&lt;ref name="Overpack" /&gt; 

In 1875, he began making special pairs of extra-large wagon wheels that were {{convert|10|ft|m}} in diameter&lt;ref name="Overpack" /&gt; called ''logging wheels'' or ''big wheels''. They were double the size of ordinary wooden wagon wheels and were for hauling logs from forests that had wet terrain in the summer and heavy snows in the winter. Where he lived fit those [[:wikt:criteria|criteria]] as did the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] and other northern states. He sold and shipped his ''logging wheels'' all over the United States and Canada.

Overpack used an image of a wooden wagon wheel with spokes as a log mark as required by the 1842 Michigan law for anyone in the timber business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/hal/0,1607,7-160-15481_19268_20778-51997--,00.html The Official State of Michigan website - log marks]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage and children ==
In 1871 Overpack married Manistee native Millie Magoon (1858–1932). They had three children: Roy M. (1879–1964), Nellie May (1885– ), and Stella Rae (1891–1962).&lt;ref name="Overpack" /&gt; Roy M. graduated from [[University of Michigan]] of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] in 1903 in [[Liberal Arts]] and received a law degree in 1905. He worked at his father's business. In 1940 Roy was the Secretary for Chamber of Commerce, in Manistee. Nellie May went to Benton Harbor College – she is a music vocal teacher and a singer. Stella Rae attends Oakwood School where Nellie May teaches. They both became talented musicians.

== Other ==
Overpack was a member of the board of supervisors of Manistee and also served on the city council. He belonged to the [[Masonic]] order and [[York Rite|York Rite Masonry]] as commandery No. 32 and associated with the [[Knights Templar]]. He was also affiliated with the [[Knights of Pythias]]. His religion was associated with the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church, although he attended [[Congregational]] services. Silas was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref name="Overpack" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5002">'''Surface engineering''' is the sub-discipline of [[materials science]] which deals with the [[interface (matter)|surface]] of solid matter.  It has applications to [[chemistry]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]] (particularly in relation to [[semiconductor manufacturing]]).

[[Solids]] are composed of a bulk material covered by a surface. The surface which bounds the bulk material is called the [[Surface phase]]. It acts as an interface to the surrounding environment. The bulk material in a solid is called the [[Bulk phase]]. 

The surface phase of a solid interacts with the surrounding environment. This interaction can degrade the surface phase over time. [[Environmental degradation]] of the surface phase over time can be caused by [[wear]], [[corrosion]], [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. 

Surface engineering involves altering the properties of the Surface Phase in order to reduce the degradation over time. This is accomplished by making the surface robust to the environment in which it will be used.it provides a cost effective material for robust design. A spectrum of topics that represent the diverse nature of the field of surface engineering includes Plating technologies, Nano and emerging technologies and Surface engineering, characterization and testing.

==Applications ==

Surface engineering techniques are being used in the automotive, aerospace, missile, power, electronic, biomedical, textile, petroleum, petrochemical, chemical, steel, cement, machine tools and construction industries including [[road surface|road surfacing]]. Surface engineering techniques can be used to develop a wide range of functional properties, including physical, chemical, electrical, electronic, magnetic, mechanical, wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant properties at the required substrate surfaces.  Almost all types of materials, including metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites can be coated on similar or dissimilar materials.  It  is also possible to form coatings of newer materials (e.g., met glass. beta-C3N4), graded deposits, multi-component deposits etc. 

In 1995, surface engineering was a ₤10 billion market in the United Kingdom. Coatings, to make surface life robust from wear and corrosion, was approximately half the market. 

In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in surface engineering from age-old electroplating to processes such as vapor phase deposition, diffusion, thermal spray &amp; welding using {{clarify|text=advanced heat sources|date=January 2016}} like plasma, laser, ion, electron, microwave, solar beams, pulsed arc, pulsed combustion, spark, friction and induction.

It's estimated that loss due to wear and corrosion in the US is approximately $500 billion. In the US, there are around 9524 establishments (including automotive, aircraft, power and construction industries) who depend on engineered surfaces with support from 23,466 industries.

There are around 65 academic institutions world-wide engaged in surface engineering research and education.

==Surface Cleaning Techniques==

Surface cleaning, synonymously referred to as dry cleaning, is a mechanical
cleaning technique used to reduce superficial soil, dust, grime, insect droppings,
accretions, or other surface deposits. (Dry cleaning, as the term is used in paper
conservation, does not employ the use of organic solvents.) Surface cleaning
may be used as an independent cleaning technique, as one step (usually the
first) in a more comprehensive treatment, or as a prelude to further treatments
(e.g., aqueous immersion) which may cause dirt to set irreversibly in paper
fibers.

==Purpose==
The purpose of surface cleaning is to reduce the potential for damage to paper
artifacts by removing foreign material which can be abrasive, acidic,
hygroscopic, or degradative. The decision to remove surface dirt is also for
aesthetic reasons when it interferes with the visibility of the imagery or
information. A decision must be made balancing the probable care of each
object against the possible problems related to surface cleaning.

The main features of TeVeS can be summarized as follows:
* As it is derived from the [[action principle]], TeVeS respects [[conservation laws]];
* In the [[weak-field approximation]] of the spherically symmetric, static solution, TeVeS reproduces the MOND acceleration formula;
* TeVeS avoids the problems of earlier attempts to generalize MOND, such as [[superluminal]] propagation;
* As it is a relativistic theory it can accommodate [[gravitational lens]]ing.

The theory is based on the following ingredients:
* A unit [[vector field]];
* A dynamical [[scalar field]];
* A nondynamical scalar field;
* A matter [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] constructed using an alternate [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]];
* An arbitrary dimensionless function.

These components are combined into a relativistic [[Lagrangian density]], which forms the basis of TeVeS theory.

==Details==
MOND&lt;ref name=Milgrom1983/&gt; is a phenomenological modification of the Newtonian acceleration law. In [[Newtonian gravity]] theory, the gravitational acceleration in the spherically symmetric, static field of a point mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; at distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the source can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;a = -\frac{GM}{r^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is [[Newton's constant]] of gravitation. The corresponding force acting on a test mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;F=ma.&lt;/math&gt;

To account for the anomalous rotation curves of spiral galaxies, Milgrom proposed a modification of this force law in the form

:&lt;math&gt; F=\mu \left (\frac{a}{a_0} \right )ma,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary function subject to the following conditions:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(x)= \begin{cases} 1 &amp; |x|\gg 1 \\ x &amp; |x|\ll 1 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

In this form, MOND is not a complete theory: for instance, it violates the law of [[Momentum#Conservation of linear momentum|momentum conservation]].

However, such conservation laws are automatically satisfied for physical theories that are derived using an action principle. This led Bekenstein&lt;ref name=Bekenstein2004/&gt; to a first, nonrelativistic generalization of MOND. This theory, called [[AQUAL]] (for A QUAdratic Lagrangian) is based on the Lagrangian

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L}=-\frac{a_0^2}{8\pi G}f\left(\frac{|\nabla\Phi|^2}{a_0^2}\right)-\rho\Phi,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the Newtonian gravitational potential, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density, and &lt;math&gt;f(y)&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless function.

In the case of a spherically symmetric, static gravitational field, this Lagrangian reproduces the MOND acceleration law after the substitutions &lt;math&gt;a=-\nabla\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu(\sqrt{y})=df(y)/dy&lt;/math&gt; are made.

Bekenstein further found that AQUAL can be obtained as the nonrelativistic limit of a relativistic field theory. This theory is written in terms of a Lagrangian that contains, in addition to the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] for the metric field &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, terms pertaining to a unit vector field &lt;math&gt;u^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and two scalar fields &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, of which only &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is dynamical. The TeVeS action, therefore, can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;S_\mathrm{TeVeS}=\int\left({\mathcal L}_g+{\mathcal L}_s+{\mathcal L}_v\right)d^4x.&lt;/math&gt;

The terms in this action include the [[Einstein–Hilbert action|Einstein–Hilbert]] Lagrangian (using a metric signature &lt;math&gt;[+,-,-,-]&lt;/math&gt; and setting the speed of light, &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L}_g=-\frac{1}{16\pi G}R\sqrt{-g},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ricci scalar]] and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the determinant of the metric tensor.

The scalar field Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L}_s=-\frac{1}{2}\left[\sigma^2h^{\alpha\beta}\partial_\alpha\phi\partial_\beta\phi+\frac{1}{2}\frac{G}{l^2}\sigma^4F \left (kG\sigma^2 \right)\right]\sqrt{-g},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h^{\alpha\beta}=g^{\alpha\beta}-u^\alpha u^\beta, l&lt;/math&gt; is a constant length, &lt;math&gt; k&lt;/math&gt; is the dimensionless parameter and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; an unspecified dimensionless function; while the vector field Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L}_v=-\frac{K}{32\pi G}\left[g^{\alpha\beta}g^{\mu\nu} \left (B_{\alpha\mu}B_{\beta\nu} \right )+2\frac{\lambda}{K} \left (g^{\mu\nu}u_\mu u_\nu-1 \right )\right]\sqrt{-g}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_{\alpha\beta}=\partial_\alpha u_\beta-\partial_\beta u_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless parameter. &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are respectively called the scalar and vector coupling constants of the theory.  The consistency between the [[Gravitoelectromagnetism]] of  the TeVeS theory and that predicted and measured by the [[general relativity]] leads to &lt;math&gt;K=\frac{k}{2\pi}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Exirifard:2011vb&gt;{{Citation |last1=Exirifard |first1=Q.  |date=2013 |title=GravitoMagnetic Field in Tensor-Vector-Scalar Theory
 |journal=[[Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics]] |volume=JCAP04 |issue=&lt;!-- --&gt;|pages=034 |arxiv=1111.5210 |bibcode=2013JCAP...04..034E |doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2013/04/034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L}_v&lt;/math&gt; incorporates a Lagrange multiplier term that guarantees that the vector field remains a unit vector field.

The function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in TeVeS is unspecified.

TeVeS also introduces a "physical metric" in the form

:&lt;math&gt;{\hat g}^{\mu\nu}=e^{2\phi}g^{\mu\nu}-2u^\alpha u^\beta\sinh(2\phi).&lt;/math&gt;

The action of ordinary matter is defined using the physical metric:

:&lt;math&gt;S_m=\int{\mathcal L} \left ({\hat g}_{\mu\nu},f^\alpha,f^\alpha_{|\mu},\ldots \right)\sqrt{-{\hat g}}d^4x,&lt;/math&gt;

where covariant derivatives with respect to &lt;math&gt;{\hat g}_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; are denoted by &lt;math&gt;|.&lt;/math&gt;

TeVeS solves problems associated with earlier attempts to generalize MOND, such as superluminal propagation. In his paper, Bekenstein also investigated the consequences of TeVeS in relation to gravitational lensing and cosmology.

==Problems and criticisms==
In addition to its ability to account for the [[galaxy rotation curve|flat rotation curves]] of galaxies (which is what MOND was originally designed to address), TeVeS is claimed to be consistent with a range of other phenomena, such as [[gravitational lensing]] and cosmological observations. However, Seifert&lt;ref name=Seifert2007&gt;{{Citation |last1=Seifert |first1=M. D. |date=2007 |title=Stability of spherically symmetric solutions in modified theories of gravity |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=064002 |arxiv=gr-qc/0703060 |bibcode=2007PhRvD..76f4002S

''''' Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics ''''' is a 2008 [[popular science]] book by American [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Leonard Susskind]]. The book covers the [[black hole information paradox]], and the related scientific dispute between [[Stephen Hawking]] and Susskind.&lt;ref name="Susskind2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard Susskind|title=The Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3_rnRVxGIsC|accessdate=5 August 2012|date=7 July 2008|publisher=Hachette Inc.|chapter=Introduction|isbn=978-0-316-01640-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susskind is known for his work on [[string theory]] and wrote a previous popular science book, ''[[The Cosmic Landscape]]'', in 2005.&lt;ref name="disc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carrol|first=Sean|title=The Black Hole War|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/07/28/the-black-hole-war/|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=Discover Magazine|date=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Hawking proposed that information is lost in black holes, and not preserved in [[Hawking radiation]].&lt;ref name="disc"/&gt; Susskind disagreed, arguing that Hawking's conclusions violated one of the most basic scientific laws of the universe, the conservation of information. As Susskind depicts in his book, ''The Black Hole War'' was a "genuine scientific controversy" between scientists favoring an emphasis on the principles of [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] against those in favor of [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Susskind2008"/&gt; The debate led to the [[holographic principle]], proposed by [[Gerard 't Hooft]] and refined by Susskind, which suggested that the information is in fact preserved, stored on the boundary of a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Timmer|first=John|title=How an argument with Hawking suggested the Universe is a hologram|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/07/how-an-argument-with-hawking-suggested-the-universe-is-a-hologram/|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=Ars Technica|date=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Sean M. Carroll]] in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' praised the book for successfully explaining the topic, despite the difficulty of the subject, in a way that lay readers could understand. Carroll writes that the
book contains a "wealth of anecdotes", and that Susskind's "wit and storytelling abilities&amp;nbsp;... are pleasantly on display in" the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Sean|title=Lost in Space|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121720140527588397 |accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Johnson of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was critical of the beginning of the book, writing that the introduction on the basic concepts of relativity and [[quantum mechanics]] was excessive, especially for readers who have already read other popular science books on theoretical physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=George|title=The Theory That Ate the World|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/books/review/Johnson-t.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=New York TImes|date=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Magazine]]'''s Lev Grossman gave the book a B+, saying that "you could dismiss it all as nerd-on-nerd violence, but then you'd miss out on Susskind explaining why the universe is actually a hologram."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=5 Things You Need to Know About|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1821654,00.html|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=Time|date=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Cohen of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' criticized the book for its  "tendency to meander" with personal anecdotes, although the book "glows with the warmth of conversation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Jesse|title=Science Friction|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/13/books/bk-susskind13/2|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=13 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[New Scientist]]'' included the book on its 2008 editor's picks list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gefner|first=Amanda|title=Editor's picks 2008|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026862.400-editors-picks-2008.html|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=New Scientist|date=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Washington Post]]'' listed it as one of the best books of 2008 in their annual holiday shopping guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best Books of 2008|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/artsandliving/features/2008/holiday-guide/gifts/best-books-of-2008/|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Computer and the Brain''''' is an unfinished book by mathematician [[John von Neumann]], begun shortly before his death and first published in 1958.  Von Neumann was an important figure [[John_von_Neumann#Computing|in computer science]], and the book discusses how the brain can be viewed as a computing machine.  The book is speculative in nature, but von Neumann discusses several important differences between brains and computers of his day (such as processing speed and [[parallel computing|parallelism]]), as well as suggesting directions for future research.

At only 96 pages, the book was originally intended for Yale's [[Silliman lecture]]s, but it was published posthumously. The first edition was published in 1958 with a preface by [[Klara Dan von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=von Neumann|first=Klara|title=Preface, Von Neumann Silliman lectures|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Von_Neumann_Silliman.html|work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews Scotland|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition, published in 2000, contains a foreword by [[Paul Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]] that places von Neumann's views in the context of science at that time. The third edition, published in 2012, features a foreword by [[Ray Kurzweil]]. It has the {{ISBN|9780300181111}}.

'''''Time Reborn: From the Crisis in Physics to the Future of the Universe''''' is the fourth non-fiction book by the American [[theoretical physicist]] [[Lee Smolin]].

Smolin argues for what he calls a revolutionary view that time is real, in contrast to existing scientific orthodoxy which holds that time is merely a "stubbornly persistent illusion" ([[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s words).&lt;ref name=Guardian20130606/&gt;  Smolin hypothesizes that the very laws of physics are not fixed, but that they actually evolve over time.&lt;ref name=RSA201305/&gt;

==Content and concepts==
''Time Reborn'' is divided into two parts: Part I describes established physics and its history from the time of [[Plato]] and the main established ideas, [[Newtonian physics]] (and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]' philosophical views that countered Newton's e.g. on background dependent physics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/background_independence |title= Actors on a changing stage: quantum gravity and background independence |first=Lee |last=Smolin |work=Einstein online |quote=Newton's view of the universe is manifestly background dependent [..] But even in Newton's day, there were philosophers like Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz who took a different stance. In modern parlance, theirs is a relationist point of view. For a relationist, there is no background of absolute space and time. |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his religious justification), [[Einstein]]'s [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity|general]] relativity, and [[quantum mechanics]]. Part II describes Smolin's views (his "future" for physics, relying on his and ideas of others) on why these all are slightly wrong, that is, the need to reestablish time as fundamental (and probably space as non-fundamental, rather than vice versa, that was Einstein's view) through e.g. one idea, [[shape dynamics]], a [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] of Einstein's general relativity, that does that.

Smolin argues for what he calls a revolutionary view that time is real, in contrast to existing scientific orthodoxy which holds that time is merely a "stubbornly persistent illusion" ([[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s words).&lt;ref name=Guardian20130606&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/06/time-reborn-lee-smolin-review |title=Time Reborn by Lee Smolin – review |last=Monk |first=Ray |date=June 6, 2013 |website=The Guardian |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ISAdFSGz |archivedate=July 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smolin reasons that physicists have improperly rejected the reality of time because they confuse their mathematical models—which are timeless but deal in abstractions that do not exist—with reality.&lt;ref name=Guardian20130606/&gt; Smolin hypothesizes instead that the very laws of physics are not fixed, but that they actually evolve over time.&lt;ref name=RSA201305&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2013/time-reborn-a-new-theory-of-time-a-new-view-of-the-world |title=Time Reborn: a new theory of time - a new view of the world |date=May 21, 2013 |publisher=[[Royal Society of Arts]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ISCfPWPu |archivedate=July 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smolin asserts that overturning the existing orthodoxy is the best hope for finding solutions to contemporary physics problems, such as bringing gravity into line with the rest of the currently accepted models,&lt;ref name=Guardian20130606/&gt; the nature of the quantum world and its unification with spacetime and cosmology.&lt;ref name=RSA201305/&gt;  Outside science, Smolin asserts his views have important implications for [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]], and on how our social, political, economic and environmental decisions affect our future,&lt;ref name=RSA201305/&gt; Smolin saying that contrary to deterministic philosophies derived from conventional physics, humans do have the power to exert control over climate change, our economic system and our technology.&lt;ref name=InstEthicsEmergTech20130715&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/searle20130715 |title= Time Lost: Scene 1 |last=Searle |first=Rick |date=July 15, 2013 |publisher=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IkJkHvpw |archivedate=August 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's topic was the subject of the author's 2013 presentation at the [[Royal Society of Arts]].&lt;ref name=RSA201305/&gt;

==Reception==
{{cquote|
Through his brilliant writing [in ''[[The Trouble with Physics]]''] and articulate arguments, readers
took him seriously. One string theorist
told me that he struggled to convince nonphysicists
that he wasn’t a charlatan after the
publication of Smolin’s book.
Now, in ''Time Reborn'', Smolin attempts
to chip away at basic theories of modern
physics. He makes the case that
by doing away with time, existing
theories are missing a trick
[...]
According to Smolin,
our picture of a timeless
Universe stems from the
assumption that all modern
physics — quantum as well as
classical — is predictive. How a
system evolves is entirely encoded
in the starting set of ‘[[initial condition]]s’
and their transformation according
to the laws of physics. Evolution in time is
secondary, a by-product of the theory. This
bothers Smolin. A timeless view of reality
is, he says repeatedly, incomplete (where do
the initial conditions or laws come from?)
and, simply, “wrong”. He believes that a
better description of time lies at the heart
of some of the big questions, such as the
marriage of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] and [[general relativity]].

Smolin sketches an alternative path for
modern physics. Inspired by the ideas of
Brazilian philosopher and political theorist,
[[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]], who argues
that social structures emerge without an
underlying natural order or guiding principle,
Smolin develops some of the ideas
behind his first book, ''[[The Life of the Cosmos]].''|author=Pedro Ferreira, professor of [[astrophysics]] at the University of Oxford, UK |source=review of the book in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'' journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://timereborn.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Nature-review-of-TR-4-24-13.pdf |title=Clockwork cosmos: Pedro Ferreira ponders a vision of the Universe in which time is paramount. |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |publisher=Macmillan Publishers Limited. |via=Time Reborn website |issue=7446 |pages=430–431 |date=April 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |doi=10.1038/496430a |volume=496|bibcode = 2013Natur.496..430F }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The New York Times]]''' [[James Gleick]] wrote that Smolin's arguments from science and history were "as provocative, original, and unsettling as any I’ve read in years," contradicting the commonly accepted views of H.G. Wells, Hermann Minkowski, Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton and Plato; Gleick predicted it will ring false to many contemporaries in theoretical physics.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20130606/&gt; Gleick further wrote that Smolin has a "fairly puritanical view of what science should and should not do"—disfavoring [[multiverse]]s or other non-testable concepts or quests for timeless truths, but allowing that science creates “effective theories” even though they are incomplete, of limited domains, and approximate.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20130606&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/jun/06/time-regained/?pagination=false |title=Time Regained! |last=Gleick |first=James |date=June 6, 2013 |website=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ISFjyFBD |archivedate=July 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' described the book, which omits mathematical explanations, as being as much philosophy as science, and as providing "a flood of ideas from an imaginative thinker."&lt;ref name=Kirkus2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lee-smolin/time-reborn/ |title=Time Reborn / Kirkus Reviews  |year=2013 |website=Kirkus Reviews |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ISHiNlhg |archivedate=July 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]], author Rick Searle wrote that ''Time Reborn'' is "just as much a diagnosis of contemporary economic and political ills" as it is a book about physics.&lt;ref name=InstEthicsEmergTech20130715/&gt; Possible economic and political similarities/"implication" (to physics and philosophy discussed in the book) are only mentioned in the [[preface]] and [[epilogue]] of the book.
