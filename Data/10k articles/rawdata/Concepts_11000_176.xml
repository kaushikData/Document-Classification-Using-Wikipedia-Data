'''Alternative liability''' is a [[legal doctrine]] that allows a plaintiff to shift the burden of proving causation of her injury to multiple defendants, even though only one of them could have been responsible. The typical case showing the principle of alternative liability in action is [[Summers v. Tice]], where the two defendants negligently shot in the direction of the plaintiff and only one of the bullets caused the plaintiff's injury. In the interest of justice, the innocent plaintiff's case is not defeated because she cannot prove which party was the [[actual cause]] (but-for cause) of her injury.

==Requirements==
The doctrine requires that the plaintiff bring all possible defendants into court and that the plaintiff show the defendants all breached a duty of reasonable care. The burden then shifts to the defendants to provide evidence of who caused the injury.

==Rationale==
The underpinning of this doctrine is that a plaintiff should not be barred from seeking recovery simply because she does not know who caused her injury. The defendants are usually the parties in the best position to have the relevant information.

Distinguish alternative liability from the smoke-out function of [[res ipsa loquitur]] seen in the leading case of [[Ybarra v. Spangard]]. In ''Ybarra'', the plaintiff brought all defendants who could have ''possibly'' been negligent (breached a duty of reasonable care) so that they could show which party actually was negligent. Thus, in the smoke-out function of [[res ipsa]], the burden is shifted on the defendants to show ''negligence'', whereas in alternative liability all defendants are all shown to have breached a duty of reasonable care and the plaintiff shifts the burden to show ''causation''.

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Amanaskatā''' is the alert state of dynamic fullness of the self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]''), it is the condition where there is no mind, the mindless state; it is the state when the mind dissolves and the self shines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astadala Yogamala Vol.7|author=B.K.S.Iyengar|publisher=Allied Publishers|page=197|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=G6M-M1dNh3QC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=amanaskata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jTKQVLiCJ5LmuQSKgoLoCw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=amanaskata&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the transmental state which is also called no-mindedness (''unmani'') and yogic sleep (''[[yoga-nidra]]'') as the prolonged absorption in the formless ecstasy or ''[[nirvikalpa samadhi]]''; it is the state in which the [[jivanmukta]] (liberated being) exists experiencing a sense of universality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga: The Technology of Ecstasy|author=Georg Feuerstein|publisher=J.P.Tarcher|page=242|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zMrtAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=amanaskata&amp;dq=amanaskata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jTKQVLiCJ5LmuQSKgoLoCw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Laya-chintana'' of [[Antahkarana]] ('mind'), the mind is absorbed in ''Mahat (''[[Buddhi]]''), 'Individual Buddhi' is absorbed in the 'Cosmic Buddhi', 'Cosmic Buddhi' in ''[[Avyakta]]'' which is [[Brahman]]; in other words, the effect is absorbed into cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meditation and Mantras|author=Vishnu Devananda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=122|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=JgnTT0eqwIoC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=laya+chintana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0uzoWCnNS5&amp;sig=G9zqk5KVwCi0hQ2FyEBRmKmD5Ac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3CCRVKXDNM-MuASJ2IDoBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=laya%20chintana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1123">In mathematics, an ''n''th-order '''Argand system''' (named after [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Jean-Robert Argand]]) is a [[coordinate system]] constructed around the ''n''th [[root of unity|roots of unity]]. From the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], ''n'' axes extend such that the angle between each axis and the axes immediately before and after it is 360/''n'' [[Degree (angle)|degrees]]. For example, the [[number line]] is the 2nd-order Argand system because the two axes extending from the origin represent 1 and&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1, the 2nd roots of unity. The [[complex plane]] (sometimes called the Argand plane, also named after Argand) is the 4th-order Argand system because the 4 axes extending from the origin represent 1, ''i'', &amp;minus;1, and &amp;minus;''i'', the 4th roots of unity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29555">'''Attentional bias''' is the tendency for people's perception to be affected by their recurring thoughts at the time.&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; Attentional biases may explain an individual's failure to consider alternative possibilities, as specific thoughts guide the train of thought in a certain manner.&lt;ref name="Baron2013"/&gt; For example, smokers tend to possess a [[bias]] for cigarettes and other smoking-related cues around them, due to the positive thoughts they've already attributed between smoking and the cues they were exposed to while smoking.&lt;ref name="Begh2013" /&gt; Attentional bias has also been associated with clinically relevant symptoms such as [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt;

==In decision making==
A commonly studied experiment to test for attentional bias is one in which there are two variables, a factor (A) and a result (B). Both can be either present (P) or not present (N). This results in four possible combinations:

#Both the factor and result are present (AP/BP)
#Both the factor and result are not present (AN/BN)
#While the factor is present, the result is not (AP/BN)
#While the result is present, the factor is not (AN/BP)

The four combinations can be shown in table form as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
!
! scope="col" | A present (A)
! scope="col" | A not present (A')
|-
! scope="row" | B present (B)
|AP/BP
|AN/BP
|-
! scope="row" | B not present (B')
|AP/BN
|AN/BN
|}

A common question which follows the structure of the above experiment is: "Does God answer prayers?"&lt;ref name="Nisbett1980"/&gt; Due to attentional bias, theists tend to say "yes". They focus on the present/present (A/B) cell, as their religious beliefs in a deity cause them to fixate on the occasions when they were given what they asked for, thus they use the justification: "Many times I've asked God for something, and he's given it to me." Similarly, due to attentional bias, atheists equally tunnel on data from the present/absent (A/B', A'/B) cells: "Has God ever given me something that I didn't ask for?" or "Have I asked God for something and didn't receive it?" This experiment too supports Smedslund's general conclusion that subjects tend to ignore part of the table depending on their specific attentional biases.&lt;ref name="Baron2013"/&gt;

The scenarios can be illustrated below in a similar table to above:

{| class="wikitable"
!
! scope="col" | Asked god for A (A)
! scope="col" | Did not ask god for A (A')
|-
! scope="row" | A was fulfilled (B)
|A/B
|A'/B
|-
! scope="row" | A was not fulfilled (B')
|A/B'
|A'/B'
|}

When making decisions, attentional biases toward positive [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] have been associated with numerous positive outcomes, such as increased [[social engagement]], increased [[prosocial behaviour]], decreased [[externalizing disorders]], and decreased [[Emotional detachment|emotionally withdrawn behavior]].&lt;ref name="Troller-Renfree2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Troller-Renfree|first=Sonya|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Katie A.|last3=Sheridan|first3=Margaret A.|last4=Nelson|first4=Charles A.|last5=Zeanah|first5=Charles H.|last6=Fox|first6=Nathan A.|date=January 2017|title=The beneficial effects of a positive attention bias among children with a history of psychosocial deprivation|journal=Biological Psychology|volume=122|pages=110–120|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2016.04.008|issn=0301-0511|pmc=5074922|pmid=27109625}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, individuals with clinically relevant symptoms, such as [[anxiety disorder]]&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; and [[chronic pain]]&lt;ref name="Schoth2010" /&gt; are shown to prioritize threat cues over reward cues.&lt;ref name="Mogg2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathews1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacLeod2002" /&gt; In one experiment, faces with varying valences were presented (neutral, threatening, and happy) with a forced-choice reaction time at two exposure durations, 500 and 1250msec. For individuals with high trait anxiety, there was strong evidence for an attentional bias favoring threatening facial expressions. Additionally, increased [[dysphoria]] correlated with the tendency to avoid happy faces.&lt;ref name="Bradley1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox2010" /&gt; This tendency leads to a spiraling effect, as one will only see negative faces, which induces greater anxiety, which exacerbates the aforementioned tendency to avoid positive stimuli – a form of the vigilance-avoidance pattern.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt;

Notably, there is also a difference in attention biases between anxious and depressed individuals. Word pairs were shown to the subjects, with a dot probe following a word of each pair (dot probe paradigm). One-half of the word pairs were presented on the subliminal level, and the other half were presented on the supraliminal level, and then the response time was measured. As expected, the anxious and depressed groups showed an attentional bias towards negative words compared to the normal control group. On a supraliminal level, the depressed group showed greater vigilance for threat stimuli than the anxious group. However, for subliminal threat stimuli, the anxious group showed a greater vigilance, which implies an anxiety-related bias on the subconscious level.&lt;ref name="Mogg1995" /&gt;

==In addictive behaviour==
Research from the past two decades has established that [[Addiction|addictive behaviour]] is strongly correlated to the attentional bias for substance-related cues, in how the latter characterizes the former.&lt;ref name="Fielda2008" /&gt; An example of this is smoking and smoking-related cues.&lt;ref name="Begh2013" /&gt;

Research (using the Stroop paradigm) tested the effect of mixing smoking related words (cigarette, puff, and smoke) with: negative connoting words (sick, pain and guilty), positive connoting words, (safe, glad, and hopeful) and neutral connoting words (tool, shovel, and hammer). Results showed a strong correlation between a slower reaction time and the degree of negative language employed when discussing smoking. The results indicate attentional bias, suggesting the influence negative language has had on the individual attitude towards smoking.&lt;ref name="DrobesElibero2006"/&gt; When asked to think of the negative consequences of smoking, as the negative language evoked underlying negative feelings toward smoking, they displayed fewer cravings than the smoker subjects who were encouraged to smoke.&lt;ref name="Szasz2012" /&gt; The experiment illustrates the influence of attentional bias on environmental smoking cues and how these could contribute to a smokers' inability to quit. As stated earlier individuals' attentional biases are influenced by [[subliminal stimuli]], so in the smoker's case, they are more subject to substance-related stimuli such as observing other smokers or noticing ads for cigarettes.&lt;ref name="YanJiang2009" /&gt; The stimuli evoke expectancy of substance availability, which creates a further attentional bias for substance-related stimuli and induces craving for the substance.&lt;ref name="Fielda2008" /&gt;

Similar Stroop paradigm studies have concluded that attentional bias is not dependent on smoking itself, but rather the person who is the smoker displays attentional bias. A recent study required one group of smokers to refrain from smoking the night before and another less than an hour before. Abstinence from smoking created slower reaction time, but a smoke break between study sessions showed increased reaction time. Researchers say this shows that [[nicotine]] dependence intensifies attention, but does not directly depend on smoking itself due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="CanamarLondon2012" /&gt; The longer reaction time suggests smokers craving a cigarette linger on smoking related words.&lt;ref name="Field2009" /&gt; Smokers and smokers attempting to quit displayed the same slower reaction time for smoking related words,&lt;ref name="Cane2008" /&gt; which supports research that implies attentional bias is a behavioral mechanism versus a dependency mechanism, due to the fact that the smokers were slowed down by smoking related words and negative words, but not slowed down by positive and neutral words.

Drug addiction is also an example of attentional bias in that certain memories or objects can prompt intense cravings to one’s drug of choice. It is easier for individuals who experience this to relapse and begin their drug use again, because the urges given off by that initial stimuli can prove to be too strong to curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivation|last=Deckers|first=Lambert|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781351713887|edition=5th|location=New York|pages=110-111}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some ways that individuals could overcome attentional bias, and a solution is stimuli-related therapy. This type of therapy would give those struggling with addiction and relapse an opportunity to overcome the initial fear associated with a particular object. A study conducted by a group of researchers in the Netherlands found that by giving participants an opportunity to attend therapy sessions during their treatment for drug addiction, more participants remained drug free compared to those who relapsed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Marissen, M. A. E., Franken, I. H. A., Waters, A. J., Blanken, P., van den Brink, W., &amp; Hendriks, V. M. (2006). Attentional bias predicts heroin relapse following treatment. ''Addiction'', ''101''(9), 1306–1312.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the conclusion can be drawn that with exposure therapy, the number of patients who will leave a treatment facility and relapse decreases.The Stoop Test also showed in this study that between the control group and the treatment group the only major component of the test was time; researchers made the claim that those who received treatment reacted a lot faster to certain drug related stimuli versus those in the control group who did not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that when experiencing attentional bias, treated addicts seemed to brush off the memories a little easier compared to those who had not received proper treatment. In other words, certain steps need to be taken in treatment facilities across the country to ensure that drug addiction no longer rises, or continues to ruin people’s lives. Also, a therapy of this kind should be closely monitored and mandatory to ensure the smallest number of relapses occur after treatment.

==Measurements==
There are two different forms of attentional bias that can be measured:

; Within-subject bias
: When there is a significant difference between an anxious individuals' attention bias towards threat-related stimuli and attention bias towards [[Neutral stimulus|neutral stimuli]] (which usually favors threat-related stimuli)&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt;

; Between-subject bias
: When there is a significant difference between non-anxious and anxious individuals' attention bias towards and neutral stimuli and threat-related stimuli&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt;

===Measurement paradigms===
There are four main paradigms used to measure attentional bias:&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt;

; [[Stroop effect|Stroop]] paradigm
: The Stroop paradigm was the first measure of attentional bias.&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt; It also uses reaction time, only in this case utilizing [[color]]s. The subject would have to read the color of the word (e.g. brown), however, the name of the word would be a different color (e.g. red). Variations involve the opposite, where one would have to read the name of the word, but the color of the word would differ to it.

; [[Dot-probe paradigm]]
: The dot-probe paradigm/task is the gold standard in attentional bias research, considered an upgraded version of the dot-probe paradigm.&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt; Two stimuli of difference valences are presented simultaneously for a fixed time. Then, a probe replaces one of the two stimuli, which the participants have to respond to – by classifying the probe or responding to the location.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt;

; Posner paradigm
: The Posner paradigm or Posner cueing task is similar to the [[dot-probe paradigm]].&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt; It is a sight test, which assesses the individual's ability to switch and focus on different stimuli presented. The subject focuses on a specific point, then attempts to react as quickly as possible to target stimuli presented to the sides of the specified point.

; [[Visual search]] paradigm
: The visual search is a less used method of assessing attentional bias.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt; It involves measuring one's ability to spot and discern particular objects among other objects.

While the other options are valid methods, they all tap into different aspects of attention bias.&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; Because of this, some methods are less used when looking into specific aspects of attentional bias. For example, in a posner cueing task, the cues were either a ''neutral'', ''angry'' or ''happy'', facial expression. There were both valid (targets appearing in the same location as the cue/face) and invalid trials (The target appearing in a different location to the cue/face). Surprisingly enough, in the invalid tests, individuals' response times increased to the same degree of attentional bias for both negative stimuli and positive stimuli, contrary to hundreds of other studies.&lt;ref name="Fox2010" /&gt;

==Mechanisms==
On a scientific level, attentional bias often seen in eye tracking movements is thought to be an underlying issue of addiction. Smokers linger on smoking cues compared with neutral cues. Researchers found higher activation in the [[insular cortex]], the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and the [[amygdala]] when presented with smoking cues. The [[orbitofrontal cortex]] is known to be coordinated with drug-seeking behavior and the insular cortex and amygdala are involved in the autonomic and emotional state of an individual.&lt;ref name="Janes2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KangChang2012" /&gt;

Neural activity is also known to decrease upon the beginning of smoking, focusing the smokers' attention on their upcoming cigarette. Therefore, when smoking cues are nearby it is harder for a smoker to concentrate on other tasks. This is seen in the activation of the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]], known for focusing attention on relevant stimuli.&lt;ref name="Luijten2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stippekohl2012" /&gt;

However beyond this, the mechanisms of attentional bias is an uncertain area, as there are many conflicting theories on how attentional biases operate.&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; An initial theory was [[Schema (psychology)|schema theory]], in which it was believed schema was biased towards threats, thus threat-related material is always favored in cognitive thinking.&lt;ref name="Beck1997" /&gt; Conversely, other individuals have argued that humans are prone to attentional biases at certain points of information processing, which is now a more common topic of controversy.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt;

Psychologist [[J. Mark G. Williams]] and colleagues have argued that anxious individuals tend to prioritize threat stimuli during early information processing, and direct their attention away from threats in more strategic stages of processing.&lt;ref name="Williams1997" /&gt; This correlates with the vigilance-avoidance pattern, which is when one initially directs attention to threat, however then proceeds to avoid processing details and information in order to avoid an anxious state of mind.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt; Conversely, others theorize that anxiety has little impact on initial detection of threats but has is more significant in modulating the maintenance of attention on the source of the threat.&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; This can be explained by the alternative theory to the vigilance-avoidance pattern, which is that anxious individuals, once processing the threat, struggle to disengage attention from the threat stimuli due to reasons such as fear.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt;

Regardless of the opinions, there have been numerous studies which attempt to find the ultimate explanation, however, there have been results which support both theories, thus making the mechanisms of attention bias an uncertain topic.

==Variables==

===Time===
In one study, stimulus exposure duration was tested against attentional bias for threat stimuli (for non-clinical anxiety). Individuals were given exposure durations of 100, 500, and 1500 millisecond intervals. However, there was shown to be no significant change is the bias towards threat stimuli.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt; The experiment has yet to be tested for clinical anxiety.

===Neurocognitive function===
A study also explored the negative relationship between neurocognitive function and attentional bias. Individuals with a lower capacity in the attentional domain, particularly in [[Digit symbol substitution test|digit symbol coding]], exhibited more attentional bias toward threats.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt;

==Clinical applications==
The link between attentional biases and addictions illustrate how controlling attentional processes may be essential in assisting smokers who are trying to quit. However, this is not dealt with, as in the case of the United Kingdom (UK), the Stop Smoking Services (SSS) and [[National Health Service]] (NHS) both have yet to target attentional biases in their [[smoking cessation]] programs.&lt;ref name="Begh2013" /&gt;

Individuals with clinically relevant symptoms, such as anxiety disorders&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; and chronic pain&lt;ref name="Schoth2010" /&gt; are shown to initially focus on threatening information.&lt;ref name="Mogg2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathews1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacLeod2002" /&gt; However, there is still uncertainty regarding the causes of this relationship. Two studies explored the causes by using a modified dot-probe paradigm and experimentally inducing differential attentional responses to emotional stimuli and then noting the effect on the consequential emotional vulnerability. The results confirmed how inducing attentional bias can alter emotional vulnerability, thus introducing the possibility that cognitive-experimental procedures designed around these results have potential therapeutic value in the future.&lt;ref name="MacLeod2002" /&gt;

'''Bonnie Bainbridge-Cohen''' (b. 1943) is a researcher, therapist and educator in the field of [[somatics]]. She is most well known for being the originator of Body-Mind Centering. She is considered{{by whom|date=November 2018}} one of the major contributors in the 20th and 21st century to the field of movement studies and has been influential in body oriented psychotherapy, dance therapy, contemporary dance, yoga and manual bodywork.

==Early life and professional career==

According to her own biography&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sensing, Feeling and Action - the Experiential Anatomy of Body-Mind Centering|last=Bainbridge-Cohen|first=Bonnie|publisher=Contact Editions|year=2012|isbn=|location=Northampton MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonnie Bainbridge-Cohen grew up in [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]], her mother was an acrobat and her father a ticket seller. In 1959, aged 16, she participated in a high-school dance project with children with learning disabilities. This led her to study ocupational therapy at [[Ohio State University]].

Having danced since childhood, she maintained a strong connection to dance at this time and took classes with [[Marian Chace]], one of the pioneers of the field of [[dance therapy]], and summer schools with [[Erick Hawkins]], a prominent modern dancer.

Once she completed her studies, she began working in hospitals and started using principles from Hawkin’s dance technique, such as focusing on active lengthening of muscles, in rehabilitation work. This was a controversial choice with her supervisors but was the beginnings of her development of Body-Mind Centering.

Later she studied neurodevelopmental therapy with [[Bobath concept|Bertha and Dr. Karel Bobath]], [[Laban movement analysis]] with [[Irmgard Bartenieff]], Kestenberg movement profiling with [[Judith Kestenberg]], [[craniosacral therapy]] with John Upledger and [[ideokinesis]] with Barbara Clark and Andre Bernard.

When she completed her studies in neurodevelopmental therapy with the Bobaths, she moved to New York but did not find the hospital environment conducive to this way of working. She found that many of New York’s dancers were however very receptive and thus began adapting the work for adults without disabilities. Out of these classes grew, directly, what was later to become the School of Body-Mind Centering and the core material in the Body-Mind Centering curriculum was developed there.

==Body-Mind Centering==

Body-Mind Centering, the approach to somatic movement education and therapy developed by Bainbridge-Cohen, combines elements of movement analysis, re-education. 

The core areas of study in Body-Mind Centering include [[Experiential anatomy|embodied anatomy]], embodied [[developmental movement]] and somatic psychology.

Following its fourth and final season in 2012, the show went on hiatus, before effectively being canceled as the contract option date passed without renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20130620/NEWS01/306200027/Future-Pawn-Stars-remains-undecided?gcheck=1|title=Future of 'Cajun Pawn Stars' undecided|last=Belgard|first=Jodi|date=20 January 2013|publisher=The Town Talk|accessdate=12 April 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Cajun Pawn Stars'' revolves around another [[family business|family-owned]] pawn shop, the Silver Dollar Pawn &amp; Jewelry Center in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], which is owned by Jimmie "Big Daddy" DeRamus, who runs the store along with his wife Peggy, his brother Johnnie, and daughter Tammie.&lt;ref name=TownTalk121911/&gt; The shop claims to have over 100,000 items within its 20,000 square foot showroom.&lt;ref name=TownTalk121911/&gt;

The show's format is similar to the original ''Pawn Stars'', as it features an array of collectible, antique and unusual items that people sell or pawn, complemented with "[[Pop-Up Video|pop-up]]" facts related to the item.  Also, as with the original series, the shop sometimes consults an expert to give an appraisal/opinion on the item being sold or pawned.  In addition, at the second commercial break, a trivia question is asked in relation to the shop or item, as with ''Pawn Stars''.

While the show is named ''"Cajun" Pawn Stars'', Alexandria, where the pawn shop is located, is the [[county seat|parish seat]] of [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana]], which is not considered part of [[Acadiana]], the hub of [[Cajun]] culture.

In mathematics, specifically in the field known as [[category theory]], a [[monoidal category]] where the monoidal ("tensor") product is the [[Product (category theory)|categorical product]] is called a '''cartesian monoidal category'''. Any category with finite products (a "finite product category") can be thought of as a cartesian monoidal category. In any cartesian monoidal category, the terminal object is the tensor unit. [[Duality (category theory)|Dually]], a monoidal finite coproduct category with the monoidal structure given by the [[coproduct]] and unit the [[initial and terminal objects|initial object]] is called a '''cocartesian monoidal category''', and any finite coproduct category can be thought of as a cocartesian monoidal category.

Cartesian categories with a [[Hom functor]] that is an [[adjoint functor]] to the product are called [[Cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=cartesian+monoidal+category|title=Cartesian monoidal category}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
Cartesian monoidal categories have a number of special and important properties, such as the existence of diagonal maps Δ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;⊗&amp;nbsp;''x'' and augmentations ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''I'' for any object ''x''. In applications to computer science we can think of Δ as ‘duplicating data’ and ''e'' as ‘deleting data’. These maps make any object into a comonoid. In fact, any object in a cartesian monoidal category becomes a [[comonoid]] in a unique way.

== Examples ==
Cartesian monoidal categories: 
*'''Set''', the category of sets with the singleton set serving as the unit.
*'''Cat''', the [[bicategory]] of small categories with the [[product category]], where the category with one object and only its identity map is the unit. 
Cocartesian monoidal categories: 
*'''Vect''', the category of [[vector space]]s over a given [[field (mathematics)|field]], can be made cocartesian monoidal with the "tensor product" given by the [[direct sum of vector spaces]] and the [[Examples of vector spaces#Trivial or zero vector space|trivial vector space]] as unit. 
*'''Ab''', the category of [[abelian group]]s, with the [[direct sum of abelian groups]] as monoidal product and the [[trivial group]] as unit. 
* More generally, the category '''''R''-mod''' of (left) modules on a ring (commutative or not) becomes a cocartesian monoidal category with the [[direct sum of modules]] as tensor product and the [[Zero object (algebra)|trivial module]] as unit.

In each of these categories of modules equipped with a cocartesian monoidal structure, finite products and coproducts coincide (in the sense that the product and coproduct of finitely many objects are isomorphic), or more formally that if ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∐ ... ∐ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; →&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the "canonical" map from the ''n''-ary coproduct of objects ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; to their product, for a natural number ''n'', in the event that the map ''f'' is an [[isomorphism]], we say that a [[biproduct]] for the objects ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is an object &lt;math&gt;  X = \bigoplus_{j \in {1,\ldots,n}} X_j. &lt;/math&gt; isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;X = \coprod_{j\in {1,\ldots,n}}X_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X = \prod_{j\in {1,\ldots,n}}X_j&lt;/math&gt; together with maps ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''X'' and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→ &amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; such that the pair (''X'',&amp;nbsp;{''i''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}) is a coproduct diagram for the objects ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and the pair (''X'',&amp;nbsp;{''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}) is a product diagram for the objects ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; , and where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∘&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. If in addition the category in question has a [[zero object]], so that for any objects ''A'' and ''B'' there is a unique map 0&lt;sub&gt;''A'',''B''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'', it often follows that  ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∘&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''&amp;delta;''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Kronecker delta]], where we interpret 0 and 1 as the 0 maps and identity maps of the objects ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. See [[pre-additive category]] for more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6614">In [[representation theory]], the '''[[Category (mathematics)|category]] of representations''' of some algebraic structure {{var|A}} has the representations of {{var|A}} as objects and [[Representation theory#Equivariant maps and isomorphisms|equivariant maps]] as [[morphism]]s between them. One of the basic thrusts of representation theory is to understand the conditions under which this category is [[semisimple category|semisimple]]; i.e., whether an object decomposes into [[simple object]]s (see [[Maschke's theorem]] for the case of finite groups).

The [[Tannakian formalism]] gives conditions under which a group ''G'' may be recovered from the category of representations of it together with the forgetful functor to the [[category of vector spaces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Jacob|first=Lurie,|date=2004-12-14|title=Tannaka Duality for Geometric Stacks|arxiv=math/0412266|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grothendieck ring]] of the category of finite-dimensional representations of a group ''G'' is called the [[representation ring]] of ''G''.

== Definitions ==
Depending on the types of the representations one wants to consider, it is typical to use slightly different definitions.

For a finite group {{var|G}} and a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] {{var|F}}, the '''category of representations of {{var|G}} over {{var|F}}''' has 
* objects: [[Tuple|pairs]] ({{var|V}},{{var|f}}) of [[vector space]]s {{var|V}} over {{var|F}} and representations {{var|f}} of {{var|G}} on that vector space
* morphisms: equivariant maps
* composition: the [[Function composition|composition]] of equivariant maps
* identities: the [[identity function]] (which is indeed an equivariant map).

The category is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rep}_F(G)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rep}(G)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a Lie group, one typically requires the representations to be [[smooth representation|smooth]] or [[admissible representation|admissible]]. For the case of a Lie algebra, see [[Lie algebra representation]]. See also: [[category O]].

=== The category of modules over the group ring ===
{{See also|Representation theory of finite groups#Representations, modules and the convolution algebra|Isomorphism of categories#Examples}}

There is an [[isomorphism of categories]] between the category of representations of a group {{var|G}} over a field {{var|F}} (described above) and the [[category of modules]] over the [[group ring]] {{var|F}}[{{var|G}}], denoted '''{{var|F}}[{{var|G}}]-Mod'''.

=== Category-theoretic definition ===
{{See also|Equivariant map#Generalization}}

Every group {{var|G}} can be viewed as a category with a single object, where [[morphism]]s in this category are the elements of {{var|G}} and composition is given by the group operation. Given an arbitrary category '''{{var|C}}''', a ''representation'' of {{var|G}} in '''{{var|C}}''' is a [[functor]] from {{var|G}} to '''{{var|C}}'''. Such a functor selects an object of '''{{var|C}}''' and a [[subgroup]] of the [[automorphism group]] of that object. For example, a [[Group action|{{var|G}}-set]] is equivalent to a functor from {{var|G}} to '''Set''', the [[category of sets]], and a linear representation is equivalent to a functor to  '''Vect'''&lt;sub&gt;{{var|F}}&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[category of vector spaces]] over a field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851741862|title=Categories for the Working Mathematician|last=Mac Lane|first=Saunders|date=1978|publisher=Springer New York|year=|isbn=1441931236|edition=Second|location=New York, NY|pages=41|oclc=851741862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this setting, the '''category of linear representations of {{var|G}} over {{var|F}}''' is the functor category {{var|G}} → '''Vect'''&lt;sub&gt;{{var|F}}&lt;/sub&gt;, which has [[natural transformation]]s as its morphisms.

== Properties ==
{{Expand section|date=November 2017}}
The category of linear representations of a group has a [[Monoidal category|monoidal structure]] given by the [[tensor product of representations]], which is an important ingredient in Tannaka-Krein duality (see below).

[[Maschke's theorem]] states that when the [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of {{var|F}} doesn't divide the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of {{var|G}}, the category of representations of {{var|G}} over {{var|F}} is [[Semisimple category|semisimple]].

== Restriction and induction ==
Given a group {{var|G}} with a [[subgroup]] {{var|H}}, there are two fundamental functors between the categories of representations of {{var|G}} and {{var|H}} (over a fixed field): one is a [[forgetful functor]] called the [[Restricted representation|restriction functor]]
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  \operatorname{Res}_H^G : \operatorname{Rep}(G) &amp;\longrightarrow \operatorname{Rep}(H) \\
  \pi &amp;\longmapsto \pi|_H
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and the other, the [[induction functor]]
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;\operatorname{Ind}_H^G : \operatorname{Rep}(H) \to \operatorname{Rep}(G)&lt;/math&gt;.

When {{var|G}} and {{var|H}} are finite groups, they are [[adjoint functor|adjoint]] to each other
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_G(\operatorname{Ind}_H^G W, U) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_H(W, \operatorname{Res}_H^G U)&lt;/math&gt;,
a theorem called [[Frobenius reciprocity]].

The basic question is whether the decomposition into irreducible representations (simple objects of the category) behaves under restriction or induction. The question may be attacked for instance by the [[Mackey theory]].

== Tannaka-Krein duality ==
{{Main|Tannaka–Krein duality}}

'''Tannaka–Krein duality''' concerns the interaction of a [[compact group|compact]] [[topological group]] and its category of [[linear representation]]s. Tannaka's theorem describes the converse passage from the category of finite dimensional representations of a group {{var|G}} back to the group {{var|G}}, allowing one to recover the group from its category of representations. Krein's theorem in effect completely characterizes all categories that can arise from a group in this fashion. These concepts can be applied to representations of several different structures, see the main article for details.

In [[political ecology]] and [[environmental policy]], '''climate governance''' is the diplomacy, mechanisms and response measures "aimed at steering social systems towards preventing, mitigating or adapting to the risks posed by [[climate change]]".&lt;ref name=Jagers2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jagers|first=S.C.|author2=Stripple, J.|title=Climate Governance beyond the State|journal=Global Governance|year=2003|volume=9|issue=3|pages=385–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; A definitive interpretation is complicated by the wide range of political and social science traditions (including [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]] and [[multilevel governance]]) that are engaged in conceiving and analysing climate governance at different levels and across different arenas. In academia, climate governance has become the concern of [[geographers]], [[anthropologists]], [[economists]] and [[business studies]] scholars.&lt;ref name=Bulkeley2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=H.|title=Climate Policy and Governance: an editorial essay|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change|year=2010|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past two decades a paradox has arisen between rising awareness about the causes and consequences of [[climate change]] and an increasing concern that the issues that surround it represent an intractable problem.&lt;ref name=Bulkeley2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Bulkeley,H.|first=Newell, P.|title=Governing Climate Change|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially, climate change was approached as a [[global issue]], and climate governance sought to address it on the international stage. This took the form of [[Multilateral Environmental Agreement]]s (MEAs), beginning with the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) in 1992. With the exception of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], [[international agreements]] between nations have been largely ineffective in achieving legally binding emissions cuts&lt;ref name="Andonova, L. B., Betsill, M. M. &amp; Bulkeley, H 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andonova, L. B., Betsill, M. M. &amp; Bulkeley, H|title=Transnational climate governance|journal=Global Environmental Politics|year=2009|volume=9|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the end of the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period in 2012, starting from 2013 there is no legally binding [[Global climate regime]]. This inertia on the international political stage contributed to alternative political narratives that called for more flexible, cost effective and participatory approaches to addressing the multifarious problems of climate change.&lt;ref name=Backstrand2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Bäckstrand, K. &amp; Lövbrand, E. in Pettenger, M.

==Background==

The development of climate governance can be traced firstly to climate diplomacy between inter-state actors and secondly to the development of transnational networks and non-state actors. The timeline above highlights key points throughout this process.  The point of ‘creation’ is difficult to determine exactly, however a definitive point in its history is the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) in Rio. This has been termed “the first major milestone in the history of climate diplomacy”.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009 22"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bulkeley, H.  |author2=Newell, P.|title=Governing climate change|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference addressed nations from across the globe and sought to emulate the diplomatic success of the Montreal Protocol in phasing out ozone-depleting chemicals.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009 22"/&gt;

As climate governance has continued to develop on the international stage, a string of transnational public and public-private actor networks have sought to implement its aims within their own arena, for example the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group|C40]], the [http://www.wmsc2010.org/list-of-cities/ Global Cities Covenant on Climate] (also known as the 'Mexico City Pact'), and the [[Cities for Climate Protection Programme]] (CCPP). The [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNFCED) in 1992 was a 'trigger' for this process. Existing regional and local networks adopted its emissions reduction targets and began to consider how they could be achieved at a local level. An example is [[ICLEI|ICLEI ‘Local Governments for Sustainability’]] that adopted the convention's [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) as part of its commitment to link local action to internationally agreed-upon goals.&lt;ref name=ICLEI2011&gt;{{cite web|last=ICLEI ‘Local Governments for Sustainability’|title=AboutICLEI|url=http://www.iclei.org/index.php?id=about|accessdate=15 May}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the umbrella of internationally agreed climate targets, innovative climate governance methods have also developed that seek to reduce emissions using market based mechanisms, for example the [[emissions trading|'cap and trade']] mechanism.

Thus, while the interstate process of treaty making continues to play a key part in mitigating anthropogenic climate change, it now exists as part of a wider tapestry of private and public climate governance initiatives that operate at multiple scales.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein, S., Betsill, M., Hoffmann, M. &amp; Paterson, M.|title=A tale of two Copenhagens: Carbon markets and climate governance|journal=Millennium-Journal of International Studies|year=2010|volume=39|issue=1|pages=161–173|doi=10.1177/0305829810372480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North-South divide==

The [[North-South divide]] is a [[socio-economic]] and [[political]] division. Applied to climate governance, the divide separates 'developed' northern countries that have historically emitted disproportionately high emissions from 'undeveloped' southern countries that have emitted considerably less emissions.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bulkeley, H.  |author2=Newell, P.|title=Governing climate change|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divide has also been used to highlight differences in vulnerability to climate change (the global south is considered more vulnerable due to a higher incident of natural disasters, less developed infrastructure and less wealth).&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; These divides have fed into all issues of international climate governance, bringing with them questions of [[social justice]] and equity that remain current today.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; A criticism of the divide is that it simplifies an increasingly complex landscape. In recent years, international trade, free capital flows and the development of some southern nations (for example [[China]] and [[India]]) have redefined global socio-economic and political relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jean-Philippe Therien|title=Beyond the North-South divide: The two tales of world poverty|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=2009|volume=20|issue=4|doi=10.1080/01436599913523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate Governance ‘in perspective'==

Climate governance has been identified as multi-scale, multi-actor and deeply embedded in our social and physical infrastructure:&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt;

*'''Multiple scale:''' Climate governance takes place and has policies enacted across diverse levels and spaces at each scale of governance. This includes [[supranational]], [[nation]]al, [[regional]] and [[local government|local]] scales. The interaction between these arenas raises important questions about where the power and authority for governing climate change lie.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; Traditional interpretations of ‘top down’ authority do not necessarily apply in the realm of climate governance which exhibits a far more complex landscape. Local initiatives can be networked horizontally, for example the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group|C40]], while some national interests feed back into international agreements.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;
*'''Multi actor:''' The fragmented and blurred roles of state and non-state actors raises ambiguities concerning their relative roles in the realm of climate governance.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; Non-state actors play critical roles in shaping the positions adopted by national governments in relation to international climate agreements, for example the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; These actors include scientific, business, lobbyists and community actors. Until the late 1990s, their influence was considered to be ‘latent’, existing outside common governance arenas. More recently, that role has been reassessed as private actors offer new sites and mechanisms that seek to address climate change.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;
*'''Embedded''': The involvement of non-state actors in climate governance is partly a reflection upon the deeply embedded social and economic nature of many of the processes that lead to [[Greenhouse gas emissions|Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions]].&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; The difficulties in addressing climate change are compounded by the complex range of processes that involve GHG emissions across the planet at all scales.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; Furthermore, decisions reached in other domains, including trade, energy security and employment inevitably impact on the efforts of climate governance to address anthropogenic climate change.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;

==Role of science==

Particular scientific and technical practices shape and inform our understanding of climate change and in doing so define how environmental problems are defined as objects of governance. For example, recent advances in [[carbon cycle]] research, [[remote sensing]] and [[carbon accounting]] techniques have revealed that [[tropical deforestation]] accounts for 15% of global [[carbon dioxide emissions]].&lt;ref name="Boyd, W. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyd, W.|title=Ways of seeing in environmental law: how deforestation became an object of climate governance|journal=Ecology Law Quarterly|year=2010|volume=37|pages=843–857}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it has become a viable concern of climate governance. Previous to its quantification, tropical deforestation had been expressly excluded from the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref name="Boyd, W. 2010"/&gt; However, the translation of scientific or policy research findings into governance through the political process remains difficult as science and politics have very different ways of dealing with the issue of uncertainty that is naturally a component of research&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, M.; Peet, J.; Vincken, M. (2009): Coping with uncertainty. Accountability challenges in global climate governance, One World Trust Briefing paper number 123, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community engagement in climate governance==

[[Community engagement]] plays an important role in the implementation of climate governance policy. There are two main reasons for this. First, where climate governance necessitates change at a behavioural level, there is a need to educate the public in order to achieve this (for example reducing car travel). Where successful, this offers the possibility that communities can become [[self governing]], for example choosing to drive less.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;
Second, effective community engagement ensures that climate governance policies are relevant to the communities in which they are intended to be applied. This necessitates a process of ‘bottom up learning’, as ideas are passed up from a local to national level. This approach has been identified as the normative framework of  ‘learning organisations’ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Power, G., Maury, M. &amp; Maury, S.|title=Operationalising bottom-up learning in international NGOs: Barriers and alternatives|journal=Development in Practice|year=2002|volume=12|issue=3|pages=272–284|doi=10.1080/0961450220149663}}&lt;/ref&gt; and popular within environmental organisations that seek to encourage grassroots development &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Roper, L.  |author2=J. Pettit|title=Development and the Learning Organisation: An Introduction|journal=Development in Practice|year=2002|volume=12|issue=3/4|pages=258–271|doi=10.1080/0961450220149654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market Based Climate Governance==

The history of climate governance has seen increasing emphasis placed on market based solutions, or “flexibility mechanisms”.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; This is a development that complements, rather than replaces traditional ‘command and control’ regulation. The decision to favour market mechanisms has been identified as inevitable given the growth in popularity of [[neoliberalism]] over the past two decades.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; Thus, targets set at international climate governance conventions have been achieved through the application of markets (for example the [[European ETS|EU-ETS]]), [[public-private partnerships]] (for example “type II partnerships”) and the self-regulation of industry (for example the [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTOGMC/EXTGGFR/0,,menuPK:578075~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:578069,00.html Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership]).

Significantly, the Kyoto Protocol offers participating countries three market based mechanisms as means to meeting their binding emissions reduction targets. These are '[[emissions trading]]' (known as “the carbon market"), 'the [[clean development mechanism]]' (CDM) and '[[joint implementation]]' (JI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNFCCC|title=The  Kyoto Protocol|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php|publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three Kyoto market mechanisms have been identified as forms of carbon market governance, a market based form of climate governance. Carbon market governance allows carbon emissions in one place to be exchanged with emissions reductions in another.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F., Pattberg, P. &amp; Zelli, F. 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Biermann, F., Pattberg, P. &amp; Zelli, F.|title=Global climate governance beyond 2012: architecture, agency and adaptation|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on measuring, monitoring and verification techniques to commensurate carbon, allowing seemingly disparate activities to appear on the same balance sheet.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F., Pattberg, P. &amp; Zelli, F. 2010"/&gt;

The largest working example of carbon market governance to date is the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU-ETS]]. It is a multinational [[emissions trading]] scheme. Advocates of this mechanism cite its focus on improving efficiency, reducing carbon where it is most cost efficient to do so. Its critics identify that it has so far allowed participating industries to profit from excess carbon credits while having little or no effect on their carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandbag|title=Sandbag ETS S.O.S: Why the flagship 'EU Emissions Trading Policy' needs rescuing|url=http://www.sandbag.org.uk/site_media/pdfs/reports/Sandbag_ETS_SOS_Report.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of climate governance stakeholders that climate action was a costly burden has somehow changed in recent years: According to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, up to 90% of the actions required to get onto a 2°C pathway would be compatible with the goals of boosting national development, equitable growth and broadly shared improvements in living standards.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tänzler et. al|first=Dennis|year=2015|title=Catalyzing the Climate Economy|url=https://library.ecc-platform.org/file/2162/download?token=90f6h_Bj|journal=Climate Diplomacy Brief|volume=|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three phenomena are behind this cost-benefit analysis: First, "negative [[Marginal abatement cost|cost abatement]]" means that curbing emissions reduces overall costs (e.g. energy savings). Second, economies of scale and learning-by-doing innovation potentially lead to falling costs over time. Third, so-called "co-benefits"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/146590200|title=Climate Diplomacy - Co-Benefits of Climate Change Policy - Sample1|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as health benefits through less air pollution or livelihood security through land restoration can be beneficial for individual countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

==Transnational networks of climate governance==

In addition to the efforts of nation-states to coordinate internationally on matters of climate governance, nation-states, non-state actors and private actors are becoming increasingly involved in multiple parallel climate governance partnerships on a global scale.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; These actors include [[cities]], [[regions]], [[NGOs]] and [[corporations]]. Their increasingly prominent involvement has led scholars to reassess the nature of power in climate governance as well as the relationship between public and private authority &lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;

To distinguish between types of climate governance networks currently in existence, it is useful to separate components into sub-categories. Studies into climate governance have distinguished between modes of governance&lt;ref name="Bailey, I 2007 431–442"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey, I|title=Neoliberalism, climate governance and the scalar politics of EU emissions trading|journal=Area|year=2007|volume=39|issue=4|pages=431–442|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4762.2007.00770.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; (self-governing, governing through enabling, governing by provision and governing by authority), types of actors and political scale of governance.&lt;ref name="Bailey, I 2007 431–442"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Betsill, M. M.  |author2=H. Bulkeley|title=Cities and the multilevel governance of global climate change|journal=lobal Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations|year=2006|volume=12|issue=2|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of this section they are separated according to the type of actors involved – ‘public climate governance partnerships’, ‘public-private climate governance’ partnerships and ‘private climate governance partnerships’. 'Modes of governance' and ‘scale’ (e.g. [[supranational]], [[Central government|national]], [[regional]], and [[local government|local]]) represent equally viable alternatives to this categorisation. While none of these approaches are definitive (each approach exhibits overlaps), defining partnerships according to participating actor is here considered to draw the clearer distinction.

==='Public' climate governance partnerships===

*'''[[Multilateral Environmental Agreement]]s (MEA's):''' MEA's can take the form of non-legally binding declarations, or legally binding treaties. Treaties between nations include framework conventions like the [[Rio Declaration]] on Environment and Development, signed at the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). There are four main criticisms of MEAs.  First, their policies have been weakened by successive compromises between bargaining nations.&lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=James Evans|title=Environmental Governance|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, where one nation refuses to participate (as occurred with the United States withdrawal from [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]]), they can still benefit from measures taken by participating nations  (for example measures to reduce their [[GHG emissions]]), even though they have not had to take action themselves &lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"/&gt; Third, developing country governments lack the capacity to shape and influence negotiating processes, giving developed countries disproportionate power to influence proceedings .&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; Fourth, the number of countries involved in international meetings inevitably leads to conflicts of interest between nations that can make it difficult to reach legally binding agreements.&lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"/&gt;
* '''Global city and regional partnerships''': Beyond the local scale, the success of urban climate governance depends on horizontal and vertical collaboration between regions and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alber, G.  |author2=K. Kern|title=Governing climate change in cities: modes of urban climate governance in multi-level systems|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/63/42545036.pdf|accessdate=15 May}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global city and regional partnerships have been identified as showing particular promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=J. Stripple|title=Beyond the public and private divide: remapping transnatio  nal climate governance in the 21st century|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be built into public non-state networks, for example the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group|C40]] network, the [http://www.wmsc2010.org/list-of-cities/ Global Cities Covenant on Climate], the [[Cities for Climate Protection Programme]] (CCPP) and the [[International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives]]. Through these  networks, [[mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] measures and [[adaptation]] strategies can be adopted by participating cities worldwide. A criticism of global city and regional partnerships is that their exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and regions which risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors.

===‘Public-private’ climate governance partnerships===

* '''Type II Partnerships''': Type II Partnerships are public-private initiatives between public, private and civic organisations that are the outcome of international treaties. The ‘type II’ label serves to contrast them against ‘type I’ partnerships which are the multilateral agreements that more traditionally arise from international treaties. An example of a Type II partnership is the (approximately) 300 partnerships upon which the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in 2002 was based.
* '''Vertical ‘[[supply chain]]’ public-private partnerships''': These are partnerships that seek to implement internationally agreed outcomes such as the [[Millennium Development Goals]] through supply chain partnerships. This is achieved firstly by facilitating and coordinating interaction between private stakeholders and secondly through constructive engagement between public and private stakeholders  regarding the development and delivery of government [[policies]], [[regulations]], programmes and schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes|title=What We Do|url=http://www.eeph.org.uk/what-we-do/|accessdate=14 May}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [http://www.eeph.org.uk/what-we-do/ Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes] in the UK.

===='Private' climate governance partnerships====

* '''Self regulating private networks''': In recent years, transnational corporations have established partnerships through private networks in a variety of schemes that encourage self-regulation of industry.&lt;ref name="Pattberg, P. and O. Enechi 2009 76–98"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=O. Enechi|title=The business of transnational climate governance: legitimate, accountable, and transparent|journal=St Antony's International Review|year=2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=76–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; These partnerships are often coordinated by [[NGOs]] and funded by government.&lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"/&gt; Existing networks include the [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTOGMC/EXTGGFR/0,,menuPK:578075~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:578069,00.html Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership] and the [[Carbon Disclosure Project]]. Both of these evidence the importance of NGOs in bringing market actors into the realm of environmental climate governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=J. Stripple|title=Beyond the public and  private divide: remapping transnational climate governance in the 21st century|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-regulating private networks have been identified as having the potential to lead to behavioural change that could lead to successful global climate governance.&lt;ref name="Pattberg, P. and O. Enechi 2009 76–98"/&gt; At present however, the networks themselves remain largely unregulated and have been criticised for lacking legitimacy, accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=J. Stripple|title=Beyond the public and private divide: remapping transnational climate governance in the 21st century|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The use of adaptive governance in climate governance ==
A relatively new approach to governing climate impacts upon social systems is to use the flexible technique of adaptive governance, introduced by [[C. S. Holling|Holling]] in 1978 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holling|first=CS|title=Adaptive environmental assessment and management|year=1978|publisher=Chichester|pages=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the more mitigation-focused approaches which have generally dominated efforts thus far. Adaptive governance “refers to the ways in which institutional arrangements evolve to satisfy the needs and desires of the community in a changing environment”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatfield-Dodds|first=Steve |author2=Nelson, Rohan |author3=Cook, David C|title=Adaptive Governance: An introduction, and implications for public policy|journal=Anzsee conference paper|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Several theorists believe that it is within a society’s capacity to adapt to the gradual climate changes we are experiencing currently, and those felt in the future.&lt;ref name="Young and Lipton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Kenneth. R|author2=Lipton, Jennifer. K|title=Adaptive governance and climate change in the tropical highlands of Western South America|journal=Climate Change|year=2006|volume=78|issue=1|pages=63–102|doi=10.1007/s10584-006-9091-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, utilizing adaptive governance is perhaps the ideal solution as its experimental approach allows newly created institutions to “experiment with different solutions and learn from them in order to adapt and transform".&lt;ref name="James Evans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James|title=Environmental Governance|year=2011|publisher=Unpublished}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of these institutions is to then formulate policies to strengthen the resilience between complex climate and social systems, and therefore the system’s ability to adapt and remain stable in the face of climate changes in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tompkins|first=Emma. L|author2=Adger, Neil|title=Does adaptive governance of natural resources enhance resilience to climate change?|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2004|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, institutions encourage communication between different levels of power (local, regional, national and international) to govern resources, whilst also engaging a broad set of stakeholders e.g. [[Non-governmental organization|NGO’s]] and the public.&lt;ref name="James Evans" /&gt;  Therefore, the approach takes a predominantly ‘bottom up’ strategy, focusing on community-based actions.&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brunner, Ronald  |author2=Lynch, Amanda|title=Adaptive governance and climate change|year=2010|publisher=American Meteorological Society|pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of climate change this provides an alternative to the ‘top down’ [[IPCC]] proceedings and world negotiations, which many perceive as having no effect in addressing climate issues.&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt;

Adaptive governance has been successfully implemented in a number of local society’s around the world in building their ability to adapt to climate change associated impacts such as extreme weather&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt; and altering plant biodiversities.&lt;ref name="Young and Lipton" /&gt;  Success has mainly been attributed to the fact that through adaptive governance, the social impact is dealt with locally to achieve a more effective result&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt;  whilst still allowing communication to flow between low to high levels of command. For example, Brunner &amp; Lynch in 2010 studied how the Barrow community in Alaska successfully communicated with local and regional governments to develop adaptive strategies for minimizing extreme weather impacts.&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt;

===Critique===
Several limitations have arisen when applying the adaptive governance strategy to climate governance. Firstly, when applied at local level, adaptive governance is evidently successful; however, Evans (2011) found problems when applying such techniques over a large scale.&lt;ref name="James Evans" /&gt; For example, the technique could have limited success when adapting to a national or international problem as the system may become too complex. A further weakness highlighted by [[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom]] in 2007 is that many adaptive governance systems have been implemented to build resilience to gradual changes but anthropogenic climate change could cause rapid alterations and so challenge the robustness of the whole governance system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=Elinor|title=Sustainable social-ecological systems:an impossibility?|journal=Social Science Research Network|year=2007|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Folke|first=Carl |author2=Hahn T |author3=Olsson P |author4=Norberg J |title=Adaptive governance of social-ecological systems|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|year=2005|volume=9|issue=2|pages=441–473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, using this experimental approach for such a precarious and influential system as our climate has been considered too risky, especially as Earth is potentially nearing the 2 degree global warming [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=IPCC AR4 WG2|first=Parry, M.L.; Canziani, O.F.; Palutikof, J.P.; van der Linden, P.J.; and Hanson, C.E., ed|title=Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with these limitations, adaptive governance is evidently a successful strategy at local scale in addressing unique climate change impacts on social systems. Therefore, the idea of focusing on and monitoring localized problems to achieve a global goal may well be highly influential as the impacts of climate change become increasingly widespread and complex.

==Future climate governance==
It is said with some imprecision by some popular observers that the core commitments of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] expire in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNFCCC|title=The Kyoto Protocol|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the first commitment period for Annex B Parties (commonly known as Annex 1 Parties) to the Kyoto Protocol run from 2008 to 2012 inclusive, with a carbon accounting truing up period that may run for some time after 2012. The other obligations of parties to the Kyoto Protocol are not time limited in the way that the First Commitment Period QELEROs of Annex B Parties are. While the more recent [[Copenhagen Accord]] endorses these commitments, it does not commit signatory countries to agree on a binding successor. Future global consensus will require the respective roles of developed and developing countries to be determined according to their relative responsibilities and capabilities. Furthermore, all participating countries will need to agree that resultant legal architecture is fair and therefore acceptable.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F.Pattberg, P.Zelli, F"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Biermann, F.Pattberg |author2=P.Zelli, F. |title=Global climate governance beyond 2012: architecture, agency and adaptation|publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key limitation in achieving this is the refusal of the United States to commit to legally binding negotiations. The re-engagement of the United States in this field has been cited as a potential future "trigger" that could lead to multilateral legally binding emissions reductions in GHG emissions.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F.Pattberg, P.Zelli, F"/&gt;

Movement at a national level could also stimulate multilateral negotiations as some countries look set to press ahead with legally binding emissions cuts. On 17 May 2011, the UK Government introduced the Fourth Carbon Budget which aims to "set an ambitious target in law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . . . and build momentum toward a legally global climate change deal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourth Carbon Budget: Oral Ministerial Statement (Chris Huhne).|url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/cb_oms/cb_oms.aspx|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of a [[Global Climate Regime|multilateral emissions reduction agreement]], the future direction of climate governance remains uncertain.&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"/&gt; Supranational and national legislation could legislate the continuation of market based emissions reduction mechanisms, for example the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU-ETS]]. The increased agency of non-state actors in the realm of global governance and the growth of public and public-private networks offer the potential for the global climate arena to develop at a sub-national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=Enechi, O.|title=The business of transnational climate governance: legitimate, accountable, and transparent?|journal=St Antony's International Review|year=2009|volume=5|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent attempts to 'territorialise' the carbon cycle seek to frame climate change as a local rather than global problem by rearticulating the global carbon cycle as a combination of national 'sinks'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stripple, Johannes|title=The climate as political space: On territorialisation of the global carbon cycle|journal=Review of International Studies|year=2006|volume=32|pages=217–235|doi=10.1017/s0260210506006991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [http://www.oneworldtrust.org/climategovernance emerging research direction is focusing on the institutional accountabilities and capability for change involved in effective global climate governance], from a perspective of individual organisations involved, as well as systemic responsiveness to people most affected by climate change&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, M.; Mayhew, S.; Cumming, L.; van Belle, S.

In [[physics]], the '''correspondence principle''' states that the behavior of systems described by the theory of [[quantum mechanics]] (or by the [[old quantum theory]]) reproduces [[classical mechanics|classical physics]] in the limit of large [[quantum numbers]]. In other words, it says that for large [[orbit]]s and for large [[energy|energies]], quantum calculations must agree with classical calculations.&lt;ref name="Tipler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tipler|first1=Paul|last2=Llewellyn|first2=Ralph|title=Modern Physics|edition=5|year=2008|publisher=[[W.

The term codifies the idea that a new theory should reproduce under some conditions the results of older well-established theories in those domains where the old theories work. This concept is somewhat different from the requirement of a formal [[Limiting case (philosophy of science)|limit]] under which the new theory reduces to the older, thanks to the existence of a deformation parameter.  {{What?|date=October 2017}}

Classical quantities appear in quantum mechanics in the form of [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expected values]] of observables, and as such the [[Ehrenfest theorem]] (which predicts the time evolution of the expected values) lends support to the correspondence principle.

==Quantum mechanics==

The rules of quantum mechanics are highly successful in describing microscopic objects, [[atom]]s and [[particle physics|elementary particles]]. But ''macroscopic systems,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt; like [[spring (device)|springs]] and [[capacitor]]s, are accurately described by classical theories like [[classical mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism|classical electrodynamics]]. If quantum mechanics were to be applicable to macroscopic objects, there must be some limit in which quantum mechanics reduces to classical mechanics.  ''Bohr's correspondence principle demands that classical physics and quantum physics give the same answer when the systems become large''.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation

The conditions under which quantum and classical physics agree are referred to as the '''correspondence limit''', or the '''[[classical limit]]'''. Bohr provided a rough prescription for the correspondence limit: it occurs ''when the quantum numbers describing the system are large''. A more elaborated analysis of quantum-classical correspondence (QCC) in wavepacket spreading leads to the distinction between robust "restricted QCC" and fragile "detailed QCC".&lt;ref&gt;

The post-1925 new quantum theory came in two different formulations. In [[matrix mechanics]], the correspondence principle was built in and was used to construct the theory. In the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger approach]] classical behavior is not clear because the waves spread out as they move. Once the Schrödinger equation was given a probabilistic interpretation, [[Ehrenfest theorem|Ehrenfest showed]] that Newton's laws hold on average: the quantum statistical expectation value of the position and momentum obey Newton's laws.

The correspondence principle is one of the tools available to physicists for selecting quantum theories corresponding to [[reality]]. The [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|principles of quantum mechanics]] are broad: states of a physical system form a [[Hilbert space|complex vector space]] and [[physical observables]] are identified with [[Hermitian operators]] that act on this [[Hilbert space]]. The correspondence principle limits the choices to those that reproduce classical mechanics in the correspondence limit.

Because quantum mechanics only reproduces classical mechanics in a statistical interpretation, and because the statistical interpretation only gives the probabilities of different classical outcomes, [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] has argued that quantum physics does not reduce to classical mechanics similarly as classical mechanics emerges as an approximation of [[special relativity]] at small [[velocity|velocities]]. He argued that classical physics exists independently of quantum theory and cannot be derived from it. His position is that it is inappropriate to understand the experiences of observers using purely quantum mechanical notions such as wavefunctions because the different states of experience of an observer are defined classically, and do not have a quantum mechanical analog. The [[many worlds interpretation|relative state interpretation]] of quantum mechanics is an attempt to understand the experience of observers using only quantum mechanical notions. Niels Bohr was an early opponent of such interpretations.

Many of these conceptual problems, however, resolve in the [[Weyl quantization|phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics]], where the ''same variables with the same interpretation'' are utilized to describe both quantum and classical mechanics.

==Other scientific theories==

The term "correspondence principle" is used in a more general sense to mean the reduction of a new [[scientific theory#science|scientific theory]] to an earlier scientific theory in appropriate circumstances. This requires that the new theory explain all the phenomena under circumstances for which the preceding theory was known to be valid, the "correspondence limit".

For example, 
*Einstein's [[special relativity]] satisfies the correspondence principle, because it reduces to classical mechanics in the limit of velocities small compared to the [[speed of light]] (example below);
* [[General relativity]] reduces to [[gravity|Newtonian gravity]] in the limit of weak gravitational fields;
* Laplace's theory of [[celestial mechanics]] reduces to Kepler's when interplanetary interactions are ignored, and Kepler's reproduces Ptolemy's [[equant]] in a coordinate system where the Earth is stationary;
* Statistical mechanics reproduces thermodynamics when the number of particles is large;
* In biology, chromosome inheritance theory reproduces Mendel's laws of inheritance, in the domain that the inherited factors are protein coding [[genes]].

In order for there to be a correspondence, the earlier theory has to have a domain of validity—it must work under ''some'' conditions. Not all theories have a domain of validity. For example, there is no limit where Newton's mechanics reduces to [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotle's mechanics]] because Aristotle's mechanics, although academically dominant for 18 centuries, does not have any domain of validity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}{{Dubious|date=April 2018}}

==Examples==
===Bohr model===
{{Main|Bohr model}}
If an electron in an atom is moving on an orbit with period {{math|''T''}},  classically the electromagnetic radiation will repeat itself every orbital period. If the coupling to the electromagnetic field is weak, so that the orbit doesn't decay very much in one cycle, the radiation will be emitted in a pattern which repeats every period, so that the Fourier transform will have frequencies which are only multiples of   {{math|1/''T''}}. This is the classical radiation law: the frequencies emitted are integer multiples of  {{math|1/''T''}}.

In quantum mechanics, this emission must be in quanta of light, of frequencies consisting of integer multiples of  {{math|1/''T''}}, so that classical mechanics is an approximate description at large quantum numbers. This means that the energy level corresponding to a classical orbit of period  {{math|1/''T''}} must have nearby energy levels which differ in energy by  {{math|''h/T''}}, and they should be equally spaced near that level,
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E_n= { h\over T(E_n) }    ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Bohr worried whether the energy spacing 1/{{math|''T''}} should be best calculated with the period of the energy state &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;E_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, or some average—in hindsight,  this model is only the leading semiclassical approximation.

Bohr considered circular orbits.  Classically, these orbits must decay to smaller circles when  photons are emitted. The level spacing between circular orbits can be calculated with the correspondence formula. For a Hydrogen atom, the classical orbits have a period  {{math|''T''}}  determined by [[Keplers laws|Kepler's third law]] to scale as  {{math|''r''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The energy scales as  {{math|1/''r''}}, so the level spacing formula  amounts to
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E \propto { 1 \over r^{3\over 2} } \propto E^{3 \over 2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
It is possible to determine the energy levels by recursively stepping down orbit by orbit, but there is a shortcut.

The angular momentum  {{math|''L''}} of the circular orbit scales as {{math|{{radic|''r''}}}}. The energy in terms of the angular momentum is then
:&lt;math&gt;E \propto {1\over r} \propto {1 \over L^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming, with Bohr, that quantized values of  {{math|''L''}} are equally spaced, the spacing between neighboring energies is
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E \propto {1 \over (L+\hbar)^2 } - {1 \over L^2} \approx  - {2\hbar  \over L^3} \propto  - E^{3 \over 2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This is as desired for equally spaced angular momenta. If one kept track of the constants, the spacing would be   {{math|''ħ''}}, so the angular momentum should be an integer multiple of  {{math|''ħ''}},
:&lt;math&gt;
L = {nh \over 2\pi} = n \hbar  ~ .
&lt;/math&gt;

This is how Bohr arrived at his [[Bohr Model|model]]. Since only the level ''spacing'' is determined heuristically by the correspondence principle, one could always add a small fixed offset to the quantum number— {{math|''L''}} could just as well have been  {{math|(''n''+.338) ''ħ''}}. 

Bohr used his physical intuition to decide which quantities were best to quantize. It is a testimony to his skill that he was able to get so much from what is only the [[leading-order|leading order]] approximation. A less heuristic treatment accounts for needed offsets in the ground state '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, cf. [[Wigner–Weyl transform]].

=== One-dimensional potential ===

Bohr's correspondence condition can be solved for the level energies in a general one-dimensional potential. Define a quantity    {{math|''J''(''E'')}} which is a function only of the energy, and has the property that
:&lt;math&gt;
{dJ \over dE} = T
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the analog of the angular momentum in the case of the circular orbits. The orbits selected by the correspondence principle are the ones that obey  {{math|''J'' {{=}} ''nh''}}  for {{mvar|n}} integer, since
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E = E_{n+1} - E_n = {dE \over dJ}(J_{n+1} - J_n) = {1 \over T} \,\Delta J
&lt;/math&gt;

This quantity  {{math|''J''}} is canonically conjugate to a variable  {{math|''θ''}} which, by the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton equations of motion]] changes with time as the gradient of energy with  {{math|''J''}}. Since this is equal to the inverse period at all times, the variable  {{math|''θ''}} increases steadily from 0 to 1 over one period.

The angle variable comes back to itself after 1 unit of increase, so the geometry of phase space in  {{math|''J'',''θ''}} coordinates is that of a half-cylinder, capped off at  {{math|''J''}} = 0, which is the motionless orbit at the lowest value of the energy. These coordinates are just as canonical as  {{math|''x'',''p''}}, but the orbits are now lines of constant  {{math|''J''}} instead of nested ovoids in  {{math|''x''-''p''}} space.

The area enclosed by an orbit is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under canonical transformations, so it is the same in  {{math|''x''-''p''}} space as in  {{math|''J''-''θ''}}. But in the {{math|''J''-''θ''}} coordinates, this area is the area of a cylinder of unit circumference between 0 and  {{math|''J''}}, or just  {{math|''J''}}. So  {{math|''J''}} is equal to the area enclosed by the orbit in  {{math|''x-p''}} coordinates too,
:&lt;math&gt;
J = \int_0^T p {d x \over dt}\, dt  ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

The quantization rule is that the [[action-angle variables|action variable]]  {{math|''J''}} is an integer multiple of  {{math|''h''}}.

=== Multiperiodic motion: Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization ===

Bohr's correspondence principle provided a way to find the semiclassical quantization rule for a one degree of freedom system. It was an argument for the old quantum condition mostly independent from the one developed by [[Wilhelm Wien|Wien]] and Einstein, which focused on [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]]. But both pointed to the same quantity, the action.

Bohr was reluctant to generalize the rule to systems with many degrees of freedom. This step was taken by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]], who proposed the general quantization rule for an [[integrable]] system,
:&lt;math&gt; J_k = h n_k. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Each action variable is a separate integer, a separate quantum number.

This condition reproduces the circular orbit condition for two dimensional motion: let  {{math|''r,θ''}} be polar coordinates for a central potential. Then  {{math|''θ''}} is already an angle variable, and the canonical momentum conjugate is  {{math|''L''}}, the angular momentum. So the quantum condition for  {{math|''L''}} reproduces Bohr's rule:
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^{2\pi} L d\theta = 2\pi L = n h.
&lt;/math&gt;

This allowed Sommerfeld to generalize Bohr's theory of circular orbits to elliptical orbits, showing that the energy levels are the same. He also found some general properties of quantum angular momentum which seemed paradoxical at the time. One of these results was that the z-component of the angular momentum, the classical inclination of an orbit relative to the z-axis, could only take on discrete values, a result which seemed to contradict rotational invariance. This was called ''space quantization'' for a while, but this term fell out of favor with the new quantum mechanics since no quantization of space is involved.

In modern quantum mechanics, the principle of superposition makes it clear that rotational invariance is not lost. It is possible to rotate objects with discrete orientations to produce superpositions of other discrete orientations, and this resolves the intuitive paradoxes of the Sommerfeld model.

===The quantum harmonic oscillator===

Here is a demonstration&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation | last1=Sells | first1=Robert L. | last2=Weidner | first2=Richard T.
      | title=Elementary modern physics
      | publisher=Allyn and Bacon | location=Boston | isbn=978-0-205-06559-2 | year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;
of how large quantum numbers can give rise to classical (continuous) behavior.

Consider the one-dimensional [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]. Quantum mechanics tells us that the total (kinetic and potential) [[energy]] of the oscillator, {{math|''E''}}, has a set of discrete values,
:&lt;math&gt;E=(n+1/2)\hbar \omega, \ n=0, 1, 2, 3, \dots ~ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where  {{math| ''ω''}}  is the [[angular frequency]] of the oscillator.

However, in a [[harmonic oscillator|classical harmonic oscillator]] such as a lead ball attached to the end of a spring, we do not perceive any discreteness. Instead, the energy of such a macroscopic system appears to vary over a continuum of values. We can verify that our idea of [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] systems fall within the correspondence limit. The energy of the classical harmonic oscillator with [[amplitude]] {{math|''A''}},  is
:&lt;math&gt; E = \frac{m \omega ^2 A^2}{2} .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the quantum number has the value
:&lt;math&gt; n = \frac{E}{\hbar \cdot \omega} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{m \omega A^2}{2\hbar} -\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

If we apply typical "human-scale" values {{math|''m''}} = 1[[kilogram|kg]],   {{math| ''ω''}} = 1 [[radian|rad]]/[[second|s]], and {{math|''A''}} = 1 m, then {{math|''n''}} ≈ 4.74×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;. This is a very large number, so the system is indeed in the correspondence limit.

It is simple to see why we perceive a continuum of energy in this limit.  With   {{math| ''ω''}} = 1  rad/s, the difference between each energy level is {{math|''ħω''}} ≈  1.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt;[[Joule|J]], well below what we normally resolve for macroscopic systems. One then describes this system through an emergent [[classical limit]].

===Relativistic kinetic energy===

Here we show that the expression of [[kinetic energy]] from [[special relativity]] becomes arbitrarily close to the classical expression, for speeds that are much slower than the [[speed of light]],  {{math|''v  ≪  c''}}.

[[Einstein]]'s   mass-energy equation
:&lt;math&gt; E =  \frac{m_0} {\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}  c^2 ~, &lt;/math&gt;
where the velocity, {{math| ''v''}} is the velocity of the body relative to the observer, &lt;math&gt; m_0 \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rest mass|''rest'' mass]] (the observed mass of the body at zero velocity relative to the observer), and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]].

When the velocity {{math| ''v''}}  vanishes, the energy expressed above is not zero, and represents the [[rest energy|''rest'' energy]],
:&lt;math&gt; E_0 = m_0 c^2. \ &lt;/math&gt;

When the body '''is''' in motion relative to the observer, the total energy exceeds the rest energy by an amount that is, by definition, the ''kinetic'' energy,
:&lt;math&gt; T = E - E_0 =  \frac{m_0 c^2} {\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \ - \ m_0 c^2 ~. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the approximation
:&lt;math&gt; ( 1 + x  )^n \approx 1 + nx \ &lt;/math&gt;
:::for  &lt;math&gt; |x| \ll 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;
we get, when speeds are much slower than that of light, or  {{math|''v  ≪  c''}},  
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt; T \ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=m_0 c^2 \left( \frac{1} {\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} - 1 \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=m_0 c^2 \left( \left( 1 - v^2/c^2 \right) ^{-\frac{1}{2}} - 1 \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\approx m_0 c^2 \left( (1 - (-\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} )v^2/c^2) - 1 \right)  \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=m_0 c^2 \left( \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} v^2/c^2 \right)  \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=  \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} m_0 v^2  ~, &lt;/math&gt;
|}
which is the [[classical physics|Newtonian]] expression for [[kinetic energy]].

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Dahara-vidya''' or 'the knowledge of Brahman within', is mentioned in the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] and the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]]. In this [[Upasana]] the sadhaka concentrates on [[Brahman]] (the Universal Self) in the cave of the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramana Hridayam|url= http://ramanahridayam.blogspot.in/2013/08/brahman-in-heart-dahaya-vidya-of.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the thirty-two ''[[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidyas]]'' of the [[Upanishads]] taught in [[Vedanta]], in which vidya Brahman is perceived as the imperceptible ether within the heart. This ''vidya'' occurs in the 8th Chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brahma Vidyas of the world|url= http://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1053074-the-32-brahma-vidyas-of-the-upanishad/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where it is taught that the abode of Brahman is the small lotus that is here in this city of Brahman, what is there in the small space within the lotus is to be searched out. This ''vidya'' explains the identity of the external and the internal, the objective and the subjective, the macrocosmic and the microcosmic, the universal and the individual, [[Brahman]] and the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vidyas from the Upanishads Item 5|author=Swami Sivananda|publisher=The Divine Life Society|url= http://sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

In the ''Dahara-vidya'', Brahman is to be conceived as dwelling in the cavity of the heart, and yet as big as the whole universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mystical Philosophies of the Upanishads|author=S.C.Sen|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnhNZQJ07DYC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=Dahara+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jqDYU7LhI8-2uATJ4YCwCQ&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Dahara%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dahara-vidya'' has for its object the realization of the Atman in the little space (''dahara'' दहरा) the subtle inner sky within oneself in the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mystic approach to the Vedas and the Upanishads|author=M.P.Pandit|publisher=Lotus Press|page=114|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8oAI40hi4-oC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Dahara+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jqDYU7LhI8-2uATJ4YCwCQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Dahara%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a classical meditative practice mentioned in the [[Vedas]]. In this ''vidya'' the desires are the auspicious qualities of Brahman which are the objects of desire; the man who knows Brahman obtains, together with Brahman, all qualities of Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedanta-Sutras Part-1|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|page=82|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=itDs5vRKao0C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Dahara+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eKTYU-O5F5aKuASaiILIDw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Dahara%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposition== 

''Dahara-vidya'' is described in six brief passages in the Chandogya Upanishad. [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] explains that for persons who have realized the unity of the Self, there is absence of the idea of 'traveler', 'travel' and 'destination', and on the cessation of the causes for continuance of the traces of ignorance etc. they merge in their own self; Brahman who is devoid of direction, location, qualities, movement, and differences of results, appears to people of dull intellect as non-existing, ''Dahara-vidya'' is taught to make them come to the right path. Therefore, the sage of Chandogya Upanishad insists that he (Brahman) who resides in the small space existing within the small lotus-like dwelling that is within the city of Brahman has to be enquired into (with the help of a teacher and other valid means). The space referred to within the heart is as vast as the space outside, within it are included both heaven and earth; whatever one has and whatever one does not have, all that is included in that space as also all beings and all desires. For those who have not realized Brahman the results acquired through actions get exhausted in this world and those acquired through virtues in the next. For those who have realized the Self there is freedom of movement in all the worlds. Then, whatever province he becomes attracted to, whatever objects he desires, that appears by his very desire, and being associated with that he becomes glorified. The sage tells us –

:स वा एष आत्मा हृदि तस्यैतदेव निरुक्तं हृदयमिति तस्मादह्रिदयमहरहर्वा एवंवित्स्वर्गं लोकमेति |

:"This self which is such surely exists in the heart. Of that this is verily the deprivation: It is in the heart; therefore that is called the heart. A man of such knowledge daily reaches the heavenly world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chandogya Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=571 to 584|url= https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Search/Author=Swami%20Gambhirananda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[semantics]] and [[discourse analysis]]: Discourse is a conceptual generalization of [[conversation]] within each modality and context of communication.
* The totality of codified language (vocabulary) used in a given field of intellectual enquiry and of social practice, such as legal discourse, medical discourse, religious discourse, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Larry|date=June 2001|publisher=revue-texto.net|accessdate=25 May 2011|title=A Little Glossary of Semantics|url=http://www.revue-texto.net/Reperes/Glossaires/Glossaire_en.html#discourse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the work of [[Michel Foucault]], and that of the social theoreticians he inspired: ''discourse'' describes "an entity of sequences, of signs, in that they are enouncements (''énoncés'')", statements in conversation.&lt;ref name=Foucault1969&gt;{{Cite book| author = M. Foucault| year = 1969| title = [[The Archaeology of Knowledge|L'Archéologie du savoir]]| location = Paris| publisher = Éditions Gallimard| authorlink = M. Foucault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discourse, an "enouncement" (statement) is not a unit of [[semiotic]] signs, but an abstract construct that allows the semiotic signs to assign meaning, and so communicate specific, repeatable communications to, between, and among objects, subjects, and statements.&lt;ref name=Foucault1969 /&gt; Therefore, a discourse is composed of semiotic sequences (relations among signs that communicate meaning) between and among objects, subjects, and statements.

The term "discursive formation" ({{lang-fr|formation discursive}}) conceptually describes the regular communications (written and spoken) that produce such discourses, such as informal conversations. As a philosopher, Michel Foucault applied the discursive formation in the analyses of large bodies of knowledge, such as [[political economy]] and [[natural history]].&lt;ref name=Foucault1970&gt;{{Cite book|author= M. Foucault|title=[[The Order of Things]]|year=1970|orig-year=1966| publisher=[[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]|isbn= 0-415-26737-4|authorlink= M. Foucault}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Compact Oxford Dictionary, Thesaurus and Wordpower Guide'' (2001). Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first sense-usage (semantics and discourse analysis), the term ''discourse'' is studied in [[corpus linguistics]], the [[study of language]] expressed in ''[[Text corpus|corpora]]'' (samples) of "real world" text. In the second sense (the codified language of a field of enquiry) and in the third sense (a statement, ''un énoncé''), the analysis of a ''discourse'' examines and determines the connections among [[language]] and [[structure and agency]].

Moreover, because a discourse is a body of text meant to communicate specific data, information, and knowledge, there exist internal relations in the content of a given discourse; likewise, there exist external relations among discourses. As such, a discourse does not exist ''per se'' (in itself), but is related to other discourses, by way of inter-discursivity. Discourses are also perpetually differentiating toward each other in time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308792484_Quantum_Anthropology_Man_Cultures_and_Groups_in_a_Quantum_Perspective|title=section on inter-discursivity, chapter 10 in Quantum anthropology: Man, cultures, and groups in a quantum perspective|last=Trnka R., Lorencova R.|first=|publisher=Charles University Karolinum Press|year=2016|isbn=978-80-246-3470-8|location=Prague|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meeting the Universe halfway: Quantum physics and entanglement of matter and meaning|last=Barad, K.|first=|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, in the course of [[Research|intellectual enquiry]], the discourse among researchers features the questions and answers of ''What is ...?'' and ''What is not. ...'', conducted according to the meanings (denotation and connotation) of the concepts (statements) used in the given field of enquiry, such as [[anthropology]], [[ethnography]], and [[sociology]]; [[cultural studies]] and [[literary theory]]; the [[philosophy of science]] and [[feminism]].

==The humanities==
In the [[humanities]] and in the [[social science]]s, the term ''discourse'' describes a formal way of thinking that can be expressed through language; the discourse is a social boundary that defines what statements can be said about a topic.

Discourse can affect the person's perspective; it is impossible to avoid discourse for any subject. For example, two notably distinct discourses can be used about various [[guerrilla]] movements describing them either as "[[Resistance movement|freedom fighters]]" or "[[terrorists]]". In other words, the chosen discourse provides the vocabulary, expressions and perhaps also the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] needed to communicate.

Discourses are embedded in different rhetorical genres and metagenres that constrain and enable them. That is language talking about language, for instance the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[DSMIV]] manual tells which terms have to be used in talking about mental health, thereby mediating meanings and dictating practices of the professionals of psychology and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine F. Schryer and Philippa Spoel. Genre Theory, Health-Care Discourse, and Professional Identity Formation. Journal of Business and Technical Communication 2005. 19: 249  http://jbt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/3/249&lt;/ref&gt;

Discourse is closely linked to different theories of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[State (polity)|state]], at least as long as defining discourses is seen to mean defining reality itself. This conception of discourse is largely derived from the work of French philosopher Michel Foucault.

== Formal semantics ==
A [[discourse representation theory]] describes the [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]] of a sentence using [[predicate logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Muskens, Reinhard. "[https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/180683/COMBININ.PDF Combining Montague semantics and discourse representation]." Linguistics and philosophy 19.2 (1996): 143-186.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Modernism ==

Modern theorists were focused on achieving progress and believed in the existence of natural and social laws which could be used universally to develop knowledge and thus a better understanding of society.&lt;ref name="Larrain, 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal
| author = J. Larrain
| year = 1994
| title = Ideology and cultural identity: Modernity and the third world presence
| location = Cambridge
| publisher = [[Polity Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernist theorists were preoccupied with obtaining the truth and reality and sought to develop theories which contained certainty and predictability.&lt;ref name="Best &amp; Kellner, 1991"&gt;{{Cite book
| author = [[Steven Best]] &amp; [[Douglas Kellner]]
| year = 1997
| title = The postmodern turn
| publisher = [[The Guilford Press]]
| isbn = 1-57230-221-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernist theorists therefore viewed discourse as being relative to talking or way of talking and understood discourse to be functional.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"&gt;Strega, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Discourse and language transformations are ascribed to progress or the need to develop new or more "accurate" words to describe new discoveries, understandings, or areas of interest.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; In modern times, language and discourse are dissociated from power and ideology and instead conceptualized as "natural" products of common sense usage or progress.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; [[Modernism]] further gave rise to the liberal discourses of rights, equality, freedom, and justice; however, this rhetoric masked substantive inequality and failed to account for differences, according to Regnier.&lt;ref&gt;Regnier, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structuralism ==

[[Structuralism|Structuralist]] theorists, such as [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Jacques Lacan]], argue that all human actions and social formations are related to [[language]] and can be understood as systems of related elements.&lt;ref name="Howarth, 2000"&gt;{{Cite book
| author = D. Howarth
| year = 2000
| title = Discourse
| location = Philadelphia, Pa.
| publisher = [[Open University Press]]
| isbn = 0-335-20070-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the "…individual elements of a system only have significance when considered in relation to the structure as a whole, and that structures are to be understood as self-contained, self-regulated, and self-transforming entities." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| title = Discourse

| isbn = 0-335-20070-2
| page =17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is the structure itself that determines the significance, meaning and function of the individual elements of a system. Structuralism has made an important contribution to our understanding of language and social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Aaron. ''Discourse and Difference'' "University of New Hampshire Cosmology Seminar" [http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/preceptorial/Summaries_2002/summary3_2002.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Course in General Linguistics|Saussure's theory of language]] highlights the decisive role of meaning and signification in structuring human life more generally.&lt;ref name="Howarth, 2000"/&gt;

== Postmodernism ==

Following the perceived limitations of the modern era, emerged [[postmodernism|postmodern]] theory.&lt;ref name="Larrain, 1994"/&gt; Postmodern theorists rejected modernist claims that there was one theoretical approach that explained all aspects of society.&lt;ref name="Best &amp; Kellner, 1991"/&gt; Rather, postmodernist theorists were interested in examining the variety of experience of individuals and groups and emphasized differences over similarities and common experiences.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt;

In contrast to modern theory, postmodern theory is more fluid and allows for individual differences as it rejected the notion of social laws. Postmodern theorists shifted away from truth seeking and instead sought answers for how truths are produced and sustained. Postmodernists contended that truth and knowledge is plural, contextual, and historically produced through discourses. Postmodern researchers therefore embarked on analyzing discourses such as texts, language, policies and practices.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt;

French social theorist [[Michel Foucault]] developed a notion of discourse in his early work, especially the ''[[Archaeology of knowledge]]'' (1972). In ''Discursive Struggles Within Social Welfare: Restaging Teen Motherhood'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Lessa | first = Iara | title=Discursive struggles within social welfare: Restaging teen motherhood | journal= [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume=36 | issue = 2 | pages=283&amp;ndash;298 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch256 | date = February 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bch256 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iara Lessa summarizes Foucault's definition of discourse as "systems of thoughts composed of ideas, attitudes, courses of action, beliefs and practices that systematically construct the subjects and the worlds of which they speak." Foucault traces the role of discourses in wider social processes of legitimating and power, emphasizing the construction of current truths, how they are maintained and what power relations they carry with them. Foucault later theorized that discourse is a medium through which power relations produce speaking subjects.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; Foucault (1977, 1980) argued that power and knowledge are inter-related and therefore every human relationship is a struggle and negotiation of power.&lt;ref&gt;Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972–1977. M Foucault. ''Selected interviews and other writings'' 1972, 1977, 1980. [[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault further stated that power is always present and can both produce and constrain the truth.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; Discourse according to Foucault (1977, 1980, 2003) is related to power as it operates by rules of exclusion. Discourse therefore is controlled by objects, what can be spoken of; ritual, where and how one may speak; and the privileged, who may speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| author = M. Foucault
| year = 1972

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coining the phrases [[power-knowledge]] Foucault (1980) stated knowledge was both the creator of power and creation of power.  An object becomes a "node within a network."  In his work, ''The Archaeology of Knowledge,'' Foucault uses the example of a book to illustrate a node within a network.  A book is not made up of individual words on a page, each of which has meaning, but rather "is caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences."  The meaning of that book is connected to a larger, overarching web of knowledge and ideas to which it relates.

One of the key discourses that Foucault identified as part of his critique of power-knowledge was that of [[neoliberalism]], which he related very closely to his conceptualization of [[governmentality]] in his lectures on biopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. (2008) ''The Birth Of Biopolitics: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1978–1979''. New York: Palgrave MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; This trajectory of Foucault's thinking has been taken up widely within [[Human Geography]].

==Early lives==
Gregory Maass was born in [[Hagen]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], northern [[Germany]], his mother tongue being [[German language|German]].  He worked as a [[paramedic]] before moving to Paris, France. He studied philosophy at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]] and art at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]], at the [[Institut des Hautes Études en Arts Plastiques]] ([[IHEAP]]) [[Paris]] (1993–94) and at [[Jan Van Eyck Academie]] the Netherlands  (1998-2000).

Nayoungim was born in [[Seoul]] in [[South Korea]]. She studied art at the [[Seoul National University]] and later at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]]. The two first met on 12 September 1991 while studying sculpture at the ENSBA. The two claim they came together because they are both egomaniacs who form a [[symbiosis]]. They communicate with each other in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]. They have claimed that they married in 2008.

===Toilet Paper Still Lifes===
are often life-size photographic representations on canvas of toilet paper rolls arranged on a table top. Depending on the composition the images are called “Arsewipe rocket”, "torche-cul", or “Ass-ana”.

===Relationships Do Not Exist===
The pair is perhaps best known for their miniature work called "Relationships Do Not Exist". This group of sculptures is one of the largest series of work created by Gregory Maass &amp; Nayoungim. Relationships Do Not Exist is among the more iconic, philosophically astute and visually humorous works that Gregory Maass &amp; Nayoungim have created. The title derives from the famous [[Jacques Lacan]] quote “Sexual relationships do not exist”.&lt;ref&gt;''Jacques Lacan, Seminar XVII|Le Séminaire. Livre XVII. L'envers de la psychanalyse, 1969-70''. Ed. [[Jacques-Alain Miller]]. Paris: Seuil, 1991: 134&lt;/ref&gt; 
They proceeded by choosing samples out of a wide collection of figurines ranging from the 1950s until today. In an intricate process the bodies are dismembered and reassembled, painted and mounted on empty trophy pedestals. Gregory Maass &amp; Nayoungim call this an adaptation method: "First we cannibalize them and then they get frankensteined back together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nayoungim-maass.blogspot.kr/2010/10/relationships-do-not-exist-index.html |title=work hard and be nice to people: Relationships do not exist |website=Nayoungim-maass.blogspot.kr |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

is a public art work installed in [[Busan]], a town where it hardly ever snows. It is a chromed steel snowman placed on a rooftop water tower of a local kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nayoungim-maass.com/worx/busan_snowman.html |title=Snowman for Busan |website=Nayoungim-maass.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akive1"/&gt;

===Mona Lisa Overdrive===
is a public art work, first installed in front of the Seoul Railway Station in 2008. It is made of rubber, toys, foam mattresses and steel frames, and sprayed over with expansion foam. The entire construction is painted with a collection of surplus paints. The face of the sculpture depicts the past, present, and future of the city of Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://likenoone.egloos.com/2142060 |title=like no one님의 이글루 : 서울역앞 뒷모습이 예쁜 그녀 |language=ko |website=Likenoone.egloos.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory Maass´ first solo-show entitled "Tears of Boredom" (the original [[German language|German]] title is "Tränen vor Langeweile"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=작성자 |url=http://causticwindowpublisher.blogspot.kr/2009/04/family-album_26.html |title=Kim Kim Press: Family Album |website=Causticwindowpublisher.blogspot.kr |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in 1991 in Hagen, Germany. It consisted of a tautological representation of peanuts. Large scale [[peanut]] butter paintings representing peanuts, black and white photographs of peanuts, and an installation of peanuts positioned in [[tensegrity]] were on display.

===The Early Worm Catches The Bird===
duo-show was about different kinds of possible success in art, be it fame and glory, money and power, or the desired result of an attempt.&lt;ref name="akive1"/&gt; The title derives from  [[Genesis P-Orridge]]´s first recording with Worm. "In the summer of 1968, Worm recorded their first and only album, entitled Early Worm, in Megson's parents attic in Solihull. It was pressed onto vinyl in November at Deroy Sound Services in Manchester, but only one copy was ever produced. A second album, Catching the Bird, was recorded but never pressed."&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Simon (1999). Wreckers of Civilisation: The Story of COUM Transmissions &amp; Throbbing Gristle.

==Influences==
Gregory Maass claims to be influenced in his thinking by [[Robert Filliou]]´s "Principle Of Equivalence", which states that (Well done, Badly done, Not done) are three equivalent assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmedia-art.org/cgi-bin/show-oeu.asp?ID=150000000034720&amp;lg=GBR |title=Robert Filliou / Telepathic Music N°7 - The Principle of Equivalence Carried to a Series of 5 |website=Newmedia-art.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the writings of [[Philip K.

In [[linguistics]], '''Heaps' law''' (also called '''Herdan's law''') is an [[empirical law]] which describes the number of distinct words in a document (or set of documents) as a function of the document length (so called type-token relation). It can be formulated as

:&lt;math&gt; V_R(n) = Kn^\beta &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of distinct words in an instance text of size ''n''. ''K'' and β are free parameters determined empirically. With English [[text corpus|text corpora]], typically ''K'' is between 10 and 100, and β is between 0.4 and 0.6.

The law is frequently attributed to [[Harold Stanley Heaps]], but was originally discovered by {{harvs|first=Gustav|last=Herdan|year=1960|txt}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Egghe|2007}}: "Herdan's law in linguistics and Heaps' law in information retrieval are different formulations of the same phenomenon".&lt;/ref&gt; Under mild assumptions, the Herdan–Heaps law is asymptotically equivalent to [[Zipf's law]] concerning the frequencies of individual words within a text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kornai|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Baeaza-Yates|Navarro|2000}}; {{harvtxt|van Leijenhorst|van der Weide|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a consequence of the fact that the type-token relation (in general) of a homogenous text can be derived from the distribution of its types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Milička|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaps' law means that as more instance text is gathered, there will be diminishing returns in terms of discovery of the full vocabulary from which the distinct terms are drawn.

Heaps' law also applies to situations in which the "vocabulary" is just some set of distinct types which are attributes of some collection of objects. For example, the objects could be people, and the types could be country of origin of the person. If persons are selected randomly (that is, we are not selecting based on country of origin), then Heaps' law says we will quickly have representatives from most countries (in proportion to their population) but it will become increasingly difficult to cover the entire set of countries by continuing this method of sampling.

Identity performance is a concept that holds that "[[Identity (social science)|identity]]" can be a project or a conscious effort or action taken to present oneself in social interactions. This is based on the definition of identity as an ongoing process of self-definition and the definitions of the self by others, which emerge out of interaction with others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multi - Girl - Culture: An Ethnography of Doing Identity|last=Duits|first=Linda|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2008|isbn=9789056295257|location=Amsterdam|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that there are identities that are performed to achieve several objectives such as assimilation and acculturation, among others. It draws from the [[Erving Goffman]]'s theatrical metaphor theory where, in social situations, the others perform the role of the audience, which an individual must perform to impress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Concept ==
In everyday [[interaction]]s, the [[Human body|body]] serves as a critical site of identity performance. In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Fred. 1992. Fashion, Culture and Identity. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and [[facial expression]]s. What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are. Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect. Through learning to make sense of others’ responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended. We can then alter our performance accordingly. This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Goffman calls [[impression management]].&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1956. The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Edinburgh: University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1963. Behavior in Public Places. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; through their behavior. People seek to define [[social situation]]s by using contextual cues from the environment around them. [[Social norm]]s emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior.

Learning how to manage impressions is a critical [[social skill]] that is honed through experience. Over time, we learn how to make meaning out of a situation, others’ reactions, and what we are projecting of ourselves. As children, we learn that actions on our part prompt reactions by adults; as we grow older, we learn to interpret these reactions and adjust our behavior. Diverse [[social environment]]s help people develop these skills because they force individuals to re-evaluate the signals they take for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Danah. 2008 “Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life.” MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Learning, Identity Volume (ed. David Buckingham).&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of learning to read [[social cues]] and react accordingly is core to being socialized into a society. While the process itself begins at home for young children, it is critical for young people to engage in broader social settings to develop these skills. Of course, how children are taught about situations and impression management varies greatly by culture,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Jean. 1999. Inuit Morality Play: The Emotional Education of a Three-Year-Old. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but these processes are regularly seen as part of coming of age. While no one is ever a true master of impression management, the [[teenage]] years are ripe with experiences to develop these skills.

In [[mediated environment]]s, bodies are not immediately visible and the skills people need to interpret situations and manage impressions are different. As Jenny Sundén argues, people must learn to write themselves into being.&lt;ref&gt;Sundén, Jenny. 2003. Material Virtualities. New York: Peter Lang Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Doing so makes visible how much we take the body for granted. While text, images, audio, and video all provide valuable means for developing a [[virtual presence]], the act of articulation differs from how we convey meaningful information through our bodies. This process also makes explicit the [[self-reflexivity]] that Giddens argues is necessary for [[identity formation]], but the choices individuals make in crafting a [[digital body]] highlight the self-monitoring that Foucault so sinisterly notes.&lt;ref&gt;See David Buckingham’s introduction to this volume for a greater discussion of this.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sense, people have more control online – they are able to carefully choose what information to put forward, thereby eliminating visceral reactions that might have seeped out in everyday [[communication]]. At the same time, these digital bodies are fundamentally coarser, making it far easier to misinterpret what someone is expressing. Furthermore, as [[Amy Bruckman]] shows, key information about a person’s body is often present online, even when that person is trying to act deceptively; for example, people are relatively good at detecting when someone is a man even when they profess to be a woman online.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Joshua and Amy Bruckman. 2001. "The Turing Game: Exploring Identity in an Online Environment." Convergence, 7(3), 83-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet because mediated environments present reveal different signals, the mechanisms of [[deception]] differ.&lt;ref&gt;Donath, Judith. 1999. “Identity and deception in the virtual community.” Communities in Cyberspace (Marc Smith &amp; Peter Kollock, eds). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
There are studies that reveal specific cases of identity performance. These include the investigation on the experiences of Latino students in the American public education system. It was found that within culturally coded classrooms, members of this ethnic group have to perform identity in the form of behavioral signal that they are as worthy of achievement as their white peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carillo|first=Andres|date=2008-2009|title=The Costs of Success: Mexican American Identity Performance within Culturally Coded Classrooms and Educational Achievement|url=|journal=Review of Law and Social Justice|volume=18: 3|pages=641-676|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also underscored that the white identity serves as the standard and that the performances often emulated it so that they form part of the how individuals from different ethnic groups assimilate. The "public performances" enacted by black females such as the assumption of the role of the "black vixen" are also cases in point. Researchers cite that roles are performed to reenact, reimagine and even revise personal and collective history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking in Tongues and Dancing Diaspora: Black Women Writing and Performing|last=Henderson|first=Mae|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780195116595|location=Oxford|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2408">'''Induced movement''' or '''induced motion''' is an [[illusion]] of [[visual perception]] in which a stationary or a moving object appears to move or to move differently because of other moving objects nearby in the [[visual field]].  It is interpreted in terms of the change in the location of an object due to the movement in the space around it. The object affected by the illusion is called the ''target'', and the other moving objects are called the ''background'' or the ''context'' (Duncker, 1929).

==Induced movement with stationary target==

A stationary object appears to move in the opposite direction to the background. For example, the moon on a cloudy, windy night appears to be racing through the sky opposite to the direction of the clouds, though the moon is essentially stationary in the sky and only appears to be moving due to the movement of the clouds. For an illustration, see http://psychlab1.hanover.edu/Classes/Sensation/induced/

==Induced movement with a moving target==

A moving object appears to be moving faster when it is moving in the opposite direction to the background; it appears to be moving slower when it is moving in the same direction as the background.&lt;ref&gt;For an illustration, see http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/psychologie/ae/Ae01/forschung/indumo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of induced movement==

Induced motion has more continuous history than does apparent motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wade|first=Nicholas J.|title=A Natural History of Vision|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=210–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Induced movement was reported by [[Ptolemy]] (ca. 90 – ca. 168 AD) (see Smith, 1996). It was researched extensively by Duncker (1929).

{{Functions}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''injective function''' or '''injection''' or '''one-to-one function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that preserves [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinctness]]: it never maps distinct elements of its [[Domain of a function|domain]] to the same element of its [[codomain]]. In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of ''at most'' one element of its domain. The term ''one-to-one function'' must not be confused with ''one-to-one correspondence'' (a.k.a.  [[bijective function]]), which uniquely maps all elements in both domain and codomain to each other (see figures).

Occasionally, an injective function from ''X'' to ''Y'' is denoted {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' ↣ ''Y''}}, using an arrow with a barbed tail ({{unichar|21A3|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Unicode| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of injective functions from ''X'' to ''Y'' may be denoted ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;''X''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; using a notation derived from that used for [[falling factorial power]]s, since if ''X'' and ''Y'' are finite sets with respectively ''m'' and ''n'' elements, the number of injections from ''X'' to ''Y'' is ''n''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;''m''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (see the [[Twelvefold way#case i|twelvefold way]]).

A function ''f'' that is not injective is sometimes called many-to-one. However, the injective terminology is also sometimes used to mean "single-valued", i.e., each argument is mapped to at most one value.

A [[monomorphism]] is a generalization of an injective function in [[category theory]].

== Definition ==
{{details|topic=notation|Function (mathematics)#Notation}}
Let ''f'' be a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[Domain of a function|domain]] is a set ''X''. The function ''f'' is said to be '''injective''' provided that for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'', whenever {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b'')}}, then {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}; that is, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b'')}} implies {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}.&amp;nbsp; Equivalently, if {{nowrap|''a'' ≠ ''b''}}, then {{nowrap|''f''(''a'') ≠ ''f''(''b'')}}.

Symbolically,

: &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \in X, \;\; f(a)=f(b) \Rightarrow a=b&lt;/math&gt;

which is logically equivalent to the [[Contraposition|contrapositive]],

: &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \in X, \;\; a \neq b \Rightarrow f(a) \neq f(b)&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
*For any set ''X'' and any subset ''S'' of ''X'' the [[inclusion map]] {{nowrap|''S'' → ''X''}} (which sends any element ''s'' of ''S'' to itself) is injective. In particular the [[identity function]] {{nowrap|''X'' → ''X''}} is always injective (and in fact bijective).
*If the domain {{nowrap|1=''X'' = [[∅]]}} or ''X'' has only one element, the function {{nowrap|''X'' → ''Y''}} is always injective.
*The function {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1}} is injective.
*The function {{nowrap|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is ''not'' injective, because (for example) {{nowrap|1=''g''(1) = 1 = ''g''(−1)}}. However, if ''g'' is redefined so that its domain is the non-negative real numbers &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,+∞)&lt;/nowiki&gt;, then ''g'' is injective.
*The [[exponential function]] {{nowrap|exp : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=exp(''x'') = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is injective (but not [[surjective]] as no real value maps to a negative number).
*The [[natural logarithm]] function {{nowrap|ln : (0, ∞) → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|''x'' ↦ ln ''x''}} is injective.
*The function {{nowrap|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''}} is not injective, since, for example, {{nowrap|1=''g''(0) = ''g''(1) = 0}}.

More generally, when ''X'' and ''Y'' are both the [[real line]] '''R''', then an injective function {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} is one whose graph is never intersected by any horizontal line more than once. This principle is referred to as the ''[[horizontal line test]]''.

That is, it is possible for ''more than one'' ''x'' in ''X'' to map to the ''same'' ''y'' in ''Y''.]]

The previous function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} can be reduced to one or more injective functions (say) {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, shown by solid curves (long-dash parts of initial curve are not mapped to anymore). Notice how the rule ''f'' has not changed – only the domain and range. ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are subsets of ''X'', ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are subsets of ''R'': for two regions where the initial function can be made injective so that one domain element can map to a single range element. That is, only one ''x'' in ''X'' maps to one ''y'' in ''Y''.]]

== Injections can be undone ==
Functions with [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|left inverses]] are always injections. That is, given {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}}, if there is a function {{nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X''}} such that, for every {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}},

:''g''(''f''(''x'')) = ''x'' (''f'' can be undone by ''g'')
 
then ''f'' is injective. In this case, ''g'' is called a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of ''f''. Conversely, ''f'' is called a [[Retract (category theory)|section]] of ''g''.

Conversely, every injection ''f'' with non-empty domain has a left inverse ''g'', which can be defined by fixing an element ''a'' in the domain of ''f'' so that ''g''(''x'') equals the unique preimage of ''x'' under ''f'' if it exists and ''g''(''x'') = ''a'' otherwise.{{refn|Unlike the corresponding statement that every surjective function has a left inverse, this does not require the [[axiom of choice]], as the existence of ''a'' is implied by the non-emptiness of the domain. However, this statement may fail in less conventional mathematics such as [[constructive mathematics]]. In constructive mathematics, the inclusion {{nowrap|{0,1} → '''R'''}} of the two-element set in the reals cannot have a left inverse, as it would violate [[indecomposability]], by giving a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of the real line to the set {0,1}.}} 

The left inverse ''g'' is not necessarily an [[inverse function|inverse]] of ''f'' because the composition in the other order, {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}}, may differ from the identity on ''Y''. In other words, an injective function can be  "reversed" by a left inverses, but is not necessarily [[inverse function|invertible]], which requires that the function is [[bijective]].

== Injections may be made invertible ==

In fact, to turn an injective function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} into a [[bijective function|bijective]] (hence [[Inverse function|invertible]]) function, it suffices to replace its codomain ''Y'' by its actual range {{nowrap|1=''J'' = ''f''(''X'')}}. That is, let {{nowrap|''g'' : ''X'' → ''J''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'')}} for all ''x'' in ''X''; then ''g'' is bijective. Indeed, ''f'' can be factored as {{nowrap|incl&lt;sub&gt;''J'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''g''}}, where {{nowrap|incl&lt;sub&gt;''J'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[inclusion function]] from ''J'' into ''Y''.

More generally, injective [[partial function]]s are called [[partial bijection]]s.

== Other properties ==
* If ''f'' and ''g'' are both injective, then {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} is injective.
[[Image:Injective composition2.svg|thumb|300px|The composition of two injective functions is injective.]]
* If {{nowrap|''g'' ∘ ''f''}} is injective, then ''f'' is injective (but ''g'' need not be).
* {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective if and only if, given any functions ''g'', {{nowrap|''h'' : ''W'' → ''X''}} whenever {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g'' = ''f'' ∘ ''h''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''h''}}. In other words, injective functions are precisely the [[monomorphism]]s in the [[category theory|category]] '''[[Category of sets|Set]]''' of sets.
* If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective and ''A'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', then {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''(''A'')) = ''A''}}. Thus, ''A'' can be recovered from its [[image (function)|image]] ''f''(''A'').
* If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective and ''A'' and ''B'' are both subsets of ''X'', then {{nowrap|1=''f''(''A'' ∩ ''B'') = ''f''(''A'') ∩ ''f''(''B'')}}.
* Every function {{nowrap|''h'' : ''W'' → ''Y''}} can be decomposed as {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''f'' ∘ ''g''}} for a suitable injection ''f'' and surjection ''g''. This decomposition is unique [[up to isomorphism]], and ''f'' may be thought of as the [[inclusion function]] of the range ''h''(''W'') of ''h'' as a subset of the codomain ''Y'' of ''h''.
* If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is an injective function, then ''Y'' has at least as many elements as ''X'', in the sense of [[cardinal number]]s. In particular, if, in addition, there is an injection from ''Y&lt;'' to ''X'', then ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same cardinal number. (This is known as the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]].)
* If both ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set|finite]] with the same number of elements, then {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective if and only if ''f'' is [[surjective]] (in which case ''f'' is [[bijective]]).
*An injective function which is a [[homomorphism]] between two algebraic structures is an [[embedding]].
*Unlike surjectivity, which is a relation between the graph of a function and its codomain, injectivity is a property of the graph of the function alone; that is, whether a function ''f'' is injective can be decided by only considering the graph (and not the codomain) of ''f''.

==Proving that functions are injective==
A proof that a function ''f'' is injective depends on how the function is presented and what properties the function holds.
For functions that are given by some formula there is a basic idea.
We use the contrapositive of the definition of injectivity, namely that if {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y'')}}, then {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Peter|title=Proving Functions One-to-One|url=http://www.math.csusb.edu/notes/proofs/bpf/node4.html|archivedate= 4 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604162511/http://www.math.csusb.edu/notes/proofs/bpf/node4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is an example:
: ''f'' = 2''x'' + 3

Proof: Let {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}}.  Suppose {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y'')}}.  So {{nowrap|1=2''x'' + 3 = 2''y'' + 3}} ⇒ {{nowrap|1=2''x'' = 2''y''}} ⇒ {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}.  Therefore, it follows from the definition that ''f'' is injective.

There are multiple other methods of proving that a function is injective.  For example, in calculus if ''f'' is a differentiable function defined on some interval, then it is sufficient to show that the derivative is always positive or always negative on that interval.  In linear algebra, if ''f'' is a linear transformation it is sufficient to show that the kernel of ''f'' contains only the zero vector.  If ''f'' is a function with finite domain it is sufficient to look through the list of images of each domain element and check that no image occurs twice on the list.

[[Image:Bouguereau-Linnocence.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]]'s ''L'Innocence'':  Women, young children and lambs are all symbols of innocence.]]
[[File:Prud'hon, Pierre Paul - Venus Bathing or Innocence - c. 1810.JPG|thumb|''Innocence'' by [[Pierre Paul Prud'hon]], circa 1810]]
'''Innocence''' is a lack of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], with respect to any kind of [[crime]], or wrongdoing. In a [[Criminal law|legal context]], innocence is to the lack of [[guilt (law)|legal guilt]] of an individual, with respect to a crime. In other contexts, it is a lack of experience.

==In relation to knowledge==
Innocence can imply lesser [[experience]] in either a relative view to social peers, or by an absolute comparison to a more common normative scale.  In contrast to ''[[ignorance]]'', it is generally viewed as a positive term, connoting an optimistic view of the world, in particular one where the lack of knowledge stems from a lack of wrongdoing, whereas greater knowledge comes from doing wrong.  This connotation may be connected with a popular [[false etymology]] explaining "innocent" as meaning "not knowing" (Latin ''noscere'' (To know, learn)). The actual etymology is from general negation prefix ''in-'' and the Latin ''nocere'', "[[to harm]]".

People who lack the mental capacity to understand the nature of their acts may be regarded as innocent regardless of their behavior.  From this meaning comes the usage of ''innocent'' as a noun to refer to a child under the [[Age of reason (canon law)|age of reason]], or a person, of any age, who is severely [[Developmental disability|mentally disabled]]. “Nonetheless, the word, innocence, is used to describe childhood innocence as a notion created and controlled by adults. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau describes 'childhood as a time of innocence' where children are 'not-knowing' and must reach the age of reason to become competent people in society. However, this is not the case anymore as technology advances, this has given children in the contemporary world a platform where they are referred to as 'digital natives', where they are seen more knowledgeable than adults &lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Danah, 1977-. It's Complicated: the Social Lives of Networked Teens. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, because of digital media and internet, young people have become well-informed of the world around and have a better understanding.

==Pejorative meaning==
In some cases, the term "innocence" has a [[pejorative]] meaning, where an assumed level of experience dictates common discourse or baseline qualifications for entry into another, different, social experience.  Since experience is a prime factor in determining a person's [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]], innocence is often also used to imply naiveté or lack of personal experience.

==Symbolism==
The [[domestic sheep|lamb]] is a commonly used symbol of innocence's nature. In [[Christianity]], for example, [[Jesus]] is referred to as the "Lamb of God", thus emphasizing his sinless nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=''Freemasonry: Its Symbolism, Religious Nature, and Law of Perfection'' (March 10, 2003)|isbn=978-0766142015|publisher=By [[Chalmers I. Paton]] (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other symbols of innocence include [[child]]ren, [[virginity|virgins]], [[acacia]] branches (especially in [[Freemasonry]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Numismatist'' (1903)|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Numismatist.html?id=WpEUAAAAYAAJ|publisher=By [[American Numismatic Association]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-sexual nudity, songbirds and the color [[white]] (biblical paintings and Hollywood films depict Jesus wearing a white tunic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge'' (1920)|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Encyclopedia_Americana.html?id=r8BPAAAAMAAJ|publisher=By [[Encyclopedia Americana|Encyclopedia Americana Corporation]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of innocence==
A "loss of innocence" is a common theme in [[fiction]], [[popular culture|pop culture]], and [[Literary realism|realism]]. It is often seen as an integral part of [[coming of age]]. It is usually thought of as an experience or period in a person's life that leads to a greater awareness of evil, pain and/or suffering in the world around them. Examples of this theme include songs like "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Saul|last=Levitt |url=http://www.missamericanpie.co.uk/interpret.html |title=Interpretation of American Pie - analysis, news, Don McLean, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, Rock &amp; Roll |publisher=Missamericanpie.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; poetry like [[William Blake]]'s collection [[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]] and novels like ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', and ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.

By contrast, the [[I ching|''I Ching'']] urges a recovery of innocence - the name given to Hexagram 25 - and "encourages you to ''actively practice innocence''".&lt;ref&gt;B. B. Walker trans, ''The I Ching or Book of Changes'' (1993) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Innocence could also be viewed as a Westernized view of childhood, and the "loss" of innocence is simply a social construction or viewed as the dominant ideology. Thinkers such as Jean-Jaques Rousseau used the romanticism discourse as a way to separate children from adults. Ideas surrounding childhood and childhood innocence stems from this discourse. It was during the 19th century when childhood became synonymous with "innocence", however not all children were considered to be innocent during that time, as it was highly dependent on the colour of one's skin. The term innocence being connected to "white childhood" was a way to racialize childhood and exclude the non-whites not only from "innocence" but from childhood as well.

==In psychoanalysis==
The [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] tradition is broadly divided between those (like [[W. R. D. Fairbairn|Fairbairn]] and [[D. W. Winnicott|Winnicott]]) who saw the child as initially innocent, but liable to lose its innocence under the impact of stress or [[psychological trauma]]; and those (like [[Freud]] and [[Melanie Klein|Klein]]) who see the child as ''developing'' innocence - maturing into it - as a result of surmounting the [[Oedipus complex]] and/or the depressive position.&lt;ref&gt;N. Symington, ''Narcissism'' (1993) p. xiv-xv&lt;/ref&gt;

More eclectically, [[Eric Berne]] saw the Child ego state, and its vocabulary, as reflecting three different possibilities: the cliches of conformity; the obscenities of revolt; and "the sweet phrases of charming innocence".&lt;ref&gt;E. Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; In a rather different formulation, [[Christopher Bollas]] used the term 'Violent Innocence' to describe a fixed and obdurate refusal to acknowledge the existence of an alternative viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;S. Cavanagh, ''Skin, Culture and Psychoanalysis'' (2013) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; - something akin to what he calls "the fascist construction, the outcome is to empty the mind of all opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]], ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sidelights==
*In ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'', a woman looks back in laughing envy at the innocence that had previously allowed her to submerge herself in the position of the 'woman-in-love'.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Lessing, ''The Golden Notebook'' (1973) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ivy Compton-Burnett]] had one character conclude dourly of another two that "you are both of you innocent though it is an innocence rooted in your wishes for your own lives".&lt;ref&gt;I. Compton-Burnett, ''The Last and the First'' (1971) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6464">'''Jack Gladstone''' was a [[British Guiana|Guianese]] slave who led the [[Demerara rebellion of 1823|Demerara Slave rebellion of 1823]], one of the biggest slave revolts in the British colonies.

He was tried after the rebellion, and was deported.

== Biography ==
Jack and his father, [[Quamina]], an African-born enslaved carpenter, lived and worked on Success plantation in Demerara.&lt;ref name=abolproject&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abolition.e2bn.org/resistance_53.html |title=Case Study 3: Demerara (1823) - Quamina and John Smith |accessdate=21 November 2009 |publisher=The Abolition Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is surnamed Gladstone, as the enslaved adopted surnames of their masters by convention. [[Sir John Gladstone, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gladstone]], who had never set foot on his plantation, had acquired half share in the plantation in 1812 through mortgage default; he acquired the remaining half four years later.&lt;ref name=Sheridan&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/nwig/article/view/3455/4216 |format=pdf |first=Richard B. |last=Sheridan |title=The Condition of slaves on the sugar plantations of Sir John Gladstone in the colony of Demerara 1812 to 1849 |journal=New West Indian Guide |volume=76 |year=2002 |number= 3/4 |pages= 243–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1828, the estate was entrusted to Frederick Cort, who was fired for being "an idler and a deceiver" who had mismanaged one estate after another.&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt;

Jack was a cooper on the plantation. As a slave who did not work under a driver, he enjoyed considerable freedom to roam about.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 182"&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a free spirit, and passionate man who despised limitations on his freedom; he was aware of the debate about slavery in Britain, and was made extremely listless by rumours of emancipation papers arriving from London.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 182"/&gt; Jack was tall and debonair, and possessed "European features" &amp;mdash; he stood at six feet two inches, was intelligent, and had a reputation as a "wild fellow". Jack had been baptised, was occasionally a "teacher", but was not a regular churchgoer because he was too restless to follow church rules.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 180"&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; He had taken Susanna, a slave on "Le Resouvenir" who was on [[John Smith (missionary)|Rev. Smith]]'s congregation, to his wife. However, in April 1812, Quamina had found out that she had become the mistress of John Hamilton, the manager at 'Le Resouvenir'.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 149"&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Rev. Smith reacted angrily, and she was expelled her from the flock by unanimous vote when she had refused to terminate the relationship.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 149"/&gt; When Susanna left, Jack married a slave on Chateau Margo plantation, but would continue to have relations with several other women on the same plantation, to the disdain of both the owner of Margo and the manager at Success.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 180"/&gt;

Da Costa puts Jack's age at around 30 at the time of the rebellion.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 180"/&gt; Following the arrival of news from Britain that measures aimed at improving the treatment of slaves in the colonies had been passed, Jack had heard a rumour that their masters had received instructions to set them free but were refusing to do so. He wrote a letter (signing his father's name) to the members of the chapel informing them of the "new law".&lt;ref name=GCN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guyanacaribbeannetwork.com/ourfeature.08.04.08.htm |title=PART II Blood, sweat, tears and the struggle for basic human rights |publisher=Guyana Caribbean Network |accessdate=21 November 2009 |df= }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, his father Quamina supported the idea of a peaceful strike, and made the fellow slaves promise not to use violence. Jack led tens of thousands of slaves to raise up against their masters. The very low number of white deaths is proof that the uprising was largely peaceful &amp;ndash; Plantation owners, managers and their families were locked up and not harmed.&lt;ref name=GCN/&gt; After the slaves' defeat in a major battle at "Bachelor's Adventure", Jack fled into the woods. A "handsome reward"&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1824), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; of one thousand guilder was offered for his capture.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 180"/&gt; Jack and Quamina remained at large until Jack and his wife were captured by Capt. McTurk at "Chateau Margo". Leading up to it, McTurk had received information on 6 September from a slave about Jack's whereabouts; there was a three-hour standoff.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1824), pp. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Quamina evaded capture for several days longer. At its end, and the slaves' defeat, hundreds of slaves were executed as ringleaders, including Quamina. Jack Gladstone was sold and deported to [[Saint Lucia]]. His legacy was to help bring attention to the plight of sugar plantation slaves, accelerating the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt;

A '''Kanban board''' is one of the tools that can be used to implement [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] to manage work at the personal or organizational level.

Kanban boards show how work moves from left to right, with each column representing a stage of the overall process, or to be more precise the system that is visualized by the board. The team pulls cards from one column to another to the right to show progress, and to coordinate their efforts with others.

Kanban boards can be used in [[knowledge work]] or for manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Gross, Kenneth R. McInnis: Kanban Made Simple—Demystifying and Applying Toyota's Legendary Manufacturing Process. Amacom, USA 2003, p. 50. {{ISBN|0-8144-0763-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At its simplest, boards are usually divided into "waiting", "work in progress" and "completed work". Complex Kanban boards can be created that visualise the flow of work across a whole [[value stream mapping|value stream map]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theagiledirector.com/content/setting-your-initial-wip-limits|title=On Setting Your Initial WIP Limits |publisher=The Agile Director |date=2014-12-07 |accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kinetic diagram of inclined block.svg|thumb|Free body and kinetic diagrams of an inclined block]]
In [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] a '''kinetic diagram''' is a pictorial device used in analyzing mechanics problems when there is determined to be a net force and/or moment acting on a body. They are related to and often used with [[free body diagram]]s. Similar to a free body diagram they depict a single body with forces and moments acting on it but in contrast they only include the net force and moment rather than all of the forces being considered.

The '''lavender scare''' refers to a [[moral panic|witch hunt]] and the mass firings of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] people in the 1950s from the United States government. It contributed to and paralleled the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] campaign known as [[McCarthyism]] and the [[McCarthyism|Second Red Scare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An interview with David K.

In popular discourse, communists and homosexuals were often conflated. Both groups were perceived as hidden subcultures with their own meeting places, literature, cultural codes, and bonds of loyalty. Both groups were thought to recruit to their ranks the psychologically weak or disturbed. And both groups were considered immoral and godless. Many people believed that the two groups were working together to undermine the government.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay men and lesbians were said to be security risks and communist sympathizers, which led to the call to remove them from state employment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lavender Scare|last=Johnson|first=David K.|publisher=Chicago University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780226401904|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former U.S. Senator [[Alan K. Simpson]] has written: "The so-called 'Red Scare' has been the main focus of most historians of that period of time. A lesser-known element ... and one that harmed far more people was the witch-hunt McCarthy and others conducted against homosexuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Alan K. |chapter=Prologue |title=Dying for Joe McCarthy's Sins: The Suicide of Wyoming Senator Lester Hunt |first2=Rodger |last2=McDaniel |publisher=WordsWorth Press |year=2013|page=x |isbn= 978-0983027591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term for this persecution was popularized by [[David K. Johnson]]'s 2004 book which studied this anti-homosexual campaign, ''The Lavender Scare.'' The book drew its title from the term "[[lavender (color)|lavender]] lads", used repeatedly by Senator [[Everett Dirksen]] as a synonym for homosexual males. In 1952, Dirksen said that a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] victory in the November elections would mean the removal of "the lavender lads" from the [[State Department]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Whitfield, ''The Culture of the Cold War'', 2nd ed. (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996), p. 44; Byron C. Hulsey, ''Everett Dirksen and his Presidents: How a Senate Giant Shaped American Politics'' (University Press of Kansas, 2000), 48–9&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used by ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' magazine, a periodical known for gossiping about the sexuality of politicians and prominent Hollywood stars.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Bernstein, "Lavender Lads Bartone Babes", ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', February 27, 2007. On the association of a variety colors with homosexuality, see Venetia Newall, "Folklore and Male Homosexuality", ''Folklore'', vol. 97, no. 2, 1986, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1950, the same year that Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] claimed 205 communists were working in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], [[Undersecretary]] of State [[John Peurifoy]] said that the State Department had allowed 91 homosexuals to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Representative [[Arthur L. Miller|Miller]] ([[Nebraska|NE]]).

McCarthy often used accusations of homosexuality as a [[smear tactic]] in his anti-communist crusade, often combining the [[Second Red Scare]] with the Lavender Scare.  On one occasion, he went so far as to announce to reporters, "If you want to be against McCarthy, boys, you've got to be either a Communist or a cocksucker."&lt;ref&gt;Cuordileone, K.A.  "'Politics in an Age of Anxiety': Cold War Political Culture and the Crisis in American Masculinity, 1949-1960"  ''The Journal of American History'' 87 (2) (2000): 515-545&lt;/ref&gt; At least one recent history has argued that, in linking communism and homosexuality and psychological imbalance, McCarthy was employing guilt-by-association if evidence for communist activity was lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Joy |last1=Damousi|first2=Mariano Ben |last2=Plotkin|title=Psychoanalysis and Politics: Histories of Psychoanalysis Under Conditions of Restricted Political Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhhpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA221|date=5 January 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-992316-8|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Executive Order 10450 ===
In 1953 [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed [[Executive Order 10450]], which set security standards for federal employment and barred homosexuals from working in the federal government. The restrictions set in place were cause for hundreds of gay people to be forcibly outed and fired from the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. The executive order was also the cause for the firing of approximately 5,000 gay people from federal employment; this included private contractors and military personnel. Not only did the victims lose their jobs, but also they were forced out of the closet and thrust into the public eye as lesbian or gay. Executive Order 10450 stayed on paper and in effect until 1995 when [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] rescinded the order and put in place the "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" policy for admittance of gays into the military.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/08/05/288942/clinton-issued-order-letting-gays-get-security-clearances-16-years-ago-today/|title=Clinton Issued Order Letting Gays Get Security Clearances 16 Years Ago Today|website=ThinkProgress|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Association of communism with "subversives" ===
Both homosexuals and [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] members were seen as subversive elements in American society who all shared the same ideals of [[antitheism]], rejection of [[Bourgeoisie#Bourgeois culture|bourgeois culture]] and middle-class morality, lack of conformity; they were scheming and manipulative and, most importantly, would put their own agendas above others in the eyes of the general population.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/mccarthyism_S.pdf|title=McCarthyism|last=Prono|first=Luca|date=|website=|publisher=[[glbtq.com]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy also associated homosexuality and communism as "threats to the 'American way of life'."&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Dennis. "Gayness, multicultural education, and community." [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=K2_VMQyk-ZMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA233 Beyond black and white: New faces and voices in the U.S. Schools] (1997): 233-256.&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality was directly linked to security concerns, and more government employees were dismissed because of their homosexual [[sexual orientation]] than because they were left-leaning or communist. George Chauncey noted that: "The specter of the invisible homosexual, like that of the invisible communist, haunted Cold War America," and homosexuality (and by implication homosexuals themselves) were constantly referred to not only as a disease, but also as an invasion, like the perceived danger of communism and subversives.&lt;ref&gt;Field, Douglas, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DztQtydwimMC American cold war culture]. Edinburgh University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Kenneth S. Wherry|Kenneth Wherry]] similarly attempted to invoke a connection between homosexuality and [[anti-nationalism]]. He said in an interview with [[Max Lerner]] that: "You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives." Later in that same interview, he drew the line between patriotic Americans and gay men: "But look Lerner, we're both Americans, aren't we? I say, let's get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government."&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Max, ''The Unfinished Country: A Book of American Symbols'' Simon and Schuster, 1959 pp 313-316&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Mattachine Society]] was founded by [[Harry Hay]], a former member of the [[Communist Party USA]], Hay resigned from the society when the membership condemned his politics as a threat to the organization he had founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lillian Faderman|author2=Stuart Timmons|title=Gay L.A.: A History of Sexual Outlaws, Power Politics, and Lipstick Lesbians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5SVsJmVxDUC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02288-5 |page=113 |accessdate=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subcommittee on Investigations ===
The Subcommittee on Investigations was a subcommittee of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments|Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments]]. This subcommittee led by Senator [[Clyde R. Hoey]] from 1949-1952  investigated "the employment of homosexuals in the Federal workforce."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/28748701|title=Executive Session Hearing of the Subcommittee on Investigations|last=|first=|date=1950|website=National Archives and Record Administration|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related report, known as the Hoey Report, stated that all of the government's intelligence agencies "are in complete agreement that sex perverts in Government constitute security risks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government|last=Johnson|first=David K.|publisher=University of Chicago|year=2004|isbn=0-226-40481-1|location=Chicago|pages=114–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary views of homosexuality ===
Washington D.C. had a fairly large and active gay community before McCarthy launched his witch hunt campaign against homosexuals, but as time went on and the climate of the Cold War spread, so too did the negative views of homosexuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because social attitudes toward homosexuality were overwhelmingly negative and the psychiatric community regarded homosexuality as a [[mental disorder]], [[gay]] men and [[lesbian]]s were considered susceptible to [[blackmail]], thus constituting a security risk. U.S. government officials assumed that [[Communism|communists]] would blackmail homosexual employees of the federal government to provide them classified information rather than risk exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Gay Today |url=http://gaytoday.com/interview/010104in.asp |title=Historian David K. Johnson: Exposes the U.S. Government's Anti-Gay Crusades |first=Raj |last=Ayyar |accessdate=May 8, 2015|date=January 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1957 [[Crittenden Report]] of the [[United States Navy]] [[Public inquiry|Board of Inquiry]] concluded that there was "no sound basis for the belief that homosexuals posed a security risk" and criticized the prior Hoey Report: "No intelligence agency, as far as can be learned, adduced any factual data before that committee with which to support these opinions" and said that "the concept that homosexuals necessarily pose a security risk is unsupported by adequate factual data."&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, 282. The Report is dated December 21, 1956, to March 15, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; The Crittenden Report remained secret until 1976. Navy officials claimed they had no record of studies of homosexuality, but attorneys learned of its existence and obtained it through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 356-67; Bérubé, 278&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 1981, the Navy claimed it was still unable to fulfill a request for the Report's supporting documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, 283; Haggerty, 45n38&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Loughery, author of a study of gay identity in the 20th century, "few events indicate how psychologically wracked America was becoming in the 1950s ... than the presumed overlap of the Communist and the homosexual menace."&lt;ref name=glbtq.com/&gt;

The research of [[Evelyn Hooker]], presented in 1956, and the first conducted without a polluted sample (gay men who had been treated for mental illness) dispelled the [[illusory correlation]] between homosexuality and mental illness that prior research, conducted with polluted sampling, had established. Hooker presented a team of three expert evaluators with 60 unmarked psychological profiles from her year of research. She chose to leave the interpretation of her results to others, to avoid potential bias. The evaluators concluded that in terms of adjustment, there were no differences between the members of each group. Her demonstration that it is not an illness led the way to the eventual removal of homosexuality from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].&lt;ref name="ucd"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/hooker2.html#biography | title=Evelyn Hooker, Ph.D.: September 2, 1907 – November 18, 1996 | publisher=UC Davis | accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance ==
One of the first and most influential members of the gay rights movements, [[Frank Kameny]], was thrust into unemployment because of his sexual orientation in 1957. He was working as an astronomer for the United States Army Map Service, but was fired as a result of the Lavender Scare and could never find another job in the United States federal government again. This led to Kameny devoting his life to the [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]], which in some ways he began. In 1965, four years before the [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall Riots]], Kameny picketed the White House on the grounds of gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://notevenpast.org/lavender-scare-cold-war-persecution-gays-and-lesbians-federal-government-2006/|title=The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government by David K. Johnson (2006)|website=notevenpast.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lillian Faderman, the [[LGBT community]] formed a [[subculture]] of its own in this era, constituting "not only a choice of sexual orientation, but of social orientation as well." The [[Mattachine Society]] and the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], which formed the [[homophile]] movements of the U.S., were in many ways defined by McCarthyism and the lavender scare.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} They were underground organizations that maintained the anonymity of their members.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
Though the main vein of McCarthyism ended in the mid-1950s when the 1956 ''Cole v Young'' ruling severely weakened the ability to fire people from the federal government for discriminatory reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/351/536/|title=Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536 (1956)|author=|date=|website=justia.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the movement that was born from it, the Lavender Scare, lived on. One such way was that Executive Order 10450, which was not rescinded until 1995, continued to bar gays from entering the military.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another form of the Lavender Scare that persisted was the [[Florida Legislative Investigation Committee]], also referred to as the FLIC and the Johns Committee. The FLIC was founded in 1956 and was not disbanded until 1964. The purpose of the committee was to operate within Florida continuing the work of the Lavender Scare by investigating and firing public school teachers who were gay. During its active years the FLIC was responsible for more than 200 firings of alleged gay teachers. The FLIC was disbanded following the release of the [[Homosexuality and Citizenship in Florida|Purple Pamphlet]] due to public outrage over its explicit and pornographic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://riches.cah.ucf.edu/committee/history.php|title=The Committee Documentary|website=riches.cah.ucf.edu|access-date=2016-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329110959/http://riches.cah.ucf.edu/committee/history.php|archivedate=2016-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the State Department formally apologized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/state-department-apologizes-lavender-scare-180961746/ "State Department Apologizes for the "Lavender Scare"], Jason Daley. Smithsonian. January 10, 2017. Retrieved 5 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary==
''The Lavender Scare,'' directed by Josh Howard, is a documentary film that recounts the events of the Lavender Scare. David K. Johnson is part of the project as the movie is based on his book.  To help with funding, Josh Howard created a [[Kickstarter]] that met its goal in donations. The film was completed in 2016 and began screenings in film festivals around the country.

{{See also|Anti-war movement|Peace movement}}

This '''list of peace activists''' includes people who have proactively advocated [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]], philosophical, and non-military resolution of major territorial or ideological disputes through [[nonviolent]] means and methods. Peace [[activist]]s usually work with others in the overall [[anti-war movement|anti-war]] and [[peace movement]]s to focus the world's attention on what they perceive to be the irrationality of violent conflicts, decisions, and actions. They thus initiate and facilitate wide public dialogues intended to nonviolently alter long-standing societal agreements directly relating to, and held in place by, the various violent, habitual, and historically fearful thought-processes residing at the core of these conflicts, with the intention of peacefully ending the conflicts themselves.

In [[mathematics]] and [[group theory]], the term '''multiplicative group''' refers to one of the following concepts:

*the '''[[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication''' of the [[invertible]] elements of a [[field (mathematics)|field]],&lt;ref&gt;See Hazewinkel et al. (2004), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or other structure for which one of its operations is referred to as multiplication. In the case of a field ''F'', the group is {{nowrap|(''F'' ∖ {0}, •)}}, where 0 refers to the [[zero element]] of ''F'' and the [[binary operation]] • is the field [[multiplication]],
*the [[algebraic torus]] GL(1).{{clarify|reason=this is not defined in this article nor in the linked article|date=March 2015}}

== Examples ==
*The [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo ''n'']] is the group under multiplication of the invertible elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  When ''n'' is not prime, there are elements other than zero that are not invertible.
* The multiplicative group of [[positive real numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt; is an [[abelian group]] with 1 its [[neutral element]]. The [[logarithm]] is a [[group isomorphism]] of this group to the [[additive group]] of real numbers, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The multiplicative group of a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all nonzero elements: &lt;math&gt;F^\times = F -\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;, under the multiplication operation. If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is [[finite field|finite]] of order ''q'' (for example ''q'' = ''p'' a prime, and &lt;math&gt;F = \mathbb F_p=\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;), then the [[finite field#multiplicative_structure|multiplicative group]] is cyclic: &lt;math&gt;F^\times \cong C_{q-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Group scheme of roots of unity==
The '''group scheme of ''n''-th [[roots of unity]]''' is by definition the kernel of the ''n''-power map on the multiplicative group GL(1), considered as a [[group scheme]]. That is, for any integer ''n'' &gt; 1 we can consider the morphism on the multiplicative group that takes ''n''-th powers, and take an appropriate [[fiber product of schemes]], with the morphism ''e'' that serves as the identity.

The resulting group scheme is written μ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. It gives rise to a [[reduced scheme]], when we take it over a field ''K'', [[if and only if]] the [[characteristic (field)|characteristic]] of ''K'' does not divide ''n''. This makes it a source of some key examples of non-reduced schemes (schemes with [[nilpotent element]]s in their [[structure sheaf|structure sheaves]]); for example μ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; over a [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements for any [[prime number]] ''p''. 

This phenomenon is not easily expressed in the classical language of algebraic geometry. It turns out to be of major importance, for example, in expressing the [[duality theory of abelian varieties]] in characteristic ''p'' (theory of [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]]). The Galois cohomology of this group scheme is a way of expressing [[Kummer theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2942">{{refimprove|date=March 2016}}In the [[philosophy of language]] and [[modal logic]], a term is said to be a '''non-rigid designator''' (or '''flaccid designator''') or '''connotative term''' if it does not extensionally designate (denote, refer to) the same object in all [[possible worlds]]. This is in contrast to a [[rigid designator]], which does designate the same object in all possible worlds in which that object exists, and does not designate anything else in those worlds in which that object does ''not'' exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, Revised Second Edition |year=2008 |page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Saul Kripke]] in his 1970 lecture series at [[Princeton University]], later published as the book ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Naming and Necessity]] |year=1980 |last=Kripke |first=Saul |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As an example, consider the phrase "The 43rd [[President of the United States|President]] of the United States of America": while the 43rd President of the United States is ''actually'' [[George W. Bush]], things might have been different. Bush might have lost the election, meaning that the 43rd President might have been [[Al Gore]] or [[Ralph Nader]] instead. (''How remote'' these possible worlds are from the actual world is a discussion for [[many-worlds interpretation|physics]] and [[Counterfactual thinking|counterfactualism]].) "The 43rd President of the United States of America" is thus a non-rigid designator, picking out George W. Bush in some possible worlds, Al Gore in others, and yet other people in other worlds.

Non-rigid designators are defined by contrast with Kripke's notion of a rigid designator, which picks out the same thing uniquely in ''every'' possible world; while there are possible worlds in which the 43rd President of the United States is Al Gore instead of George W. Bush, there are ''no'' possible worlds where ''George W. Bush'' is anyone other than the man who, in fact, he is. (There ''are'' worlds where some person other than George W. Bush is ''named'' "George W. Bush," but that's neither here nor there.)  Kripke uses this apparent asymmetry to argue (in ''Naming and Necessity'') that no [[definite description]] can be the meaning of a [[proper name]], because names must always be rigid designators, while definite descriptions can designate non-rigidly.

==Criticism==
Some philosophers, such as [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]], have expressed doubt as to whether non-rigid expressions ought to be called ''designators'' at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Varieties of Reference |year=1982 |last=Evans |first=Gareth |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Separation axioms}}

In [[topology]] and related branches of [[mathematics]], a '''normal space''' is a [[topological space]] ''X'' that satisfies '''Axiom T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''': every two disjoint [[closed set]]s of ''X'' have disjoint [[open neighborhood]]s. A normal [[Hausdorff space]] is also called a '''T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space'''. These conditions are examples of [[separation axiom]]s and their further strengthenings define '''completely normal Hausdorff spaces''', or '''T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; spaces''', and '''perfectly normal Hausdorff spaces''', or '''T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; spaces'''.

== Definitions ==

A [[topological space]] ''X'' is a '''normal space''' if, given any [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[closed set]]s ''E'' and ''F'', there are [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhoods]] ''U'' of ''E'' and ''V'' of ''F'' that are also disjoint. More intuitively, this condition says that ''E'' and ''F'' can be [[separated set|separated by neighbourhoods]].

[[File:Normal space.svg|thumb|203px|The closed sets E and F, here represented by closed disks on opposite sides of the picture, are separated by their respective neighbourhoods U and V, here represented by larger, but still disjoint, open disks.]]

A '''T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space''' is a [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]] ''X'' that is normal; this is equivalent to ''X'' being normal and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]].

A '''completely normal space''' or a '''{{visible anchor|hereditarily normal space}}''' is a topological space ''X'' such that every [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''X'' with subspace topology is a normal space. It turns out that ''X'' is completely normal if and only if every two [[separated set]]s can be separated by neighbourhoods.

A '''completely T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space''', or '''T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; space''' is a completely normal [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]] topological space ''X'', which implies that ''X'' is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]; equivalently, every subspace of ''X'' must be a T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space.

A '''perfectly normal space''' is a topological space ''X'' in which every two disjoint closed sets ''E'' and ''F'' can be precisely separated by a [[continuous function]] ''f'' from ''X'' to the [[real line]] '''R''': the [[preimage]]s of {0} and {1} under ''f'' are, respectively, ''E'' and ''F''. (In this definition, the real line can be replaced with the [[unit interval]] [0,1].)

It turns out that ''X'' is perfectly normal if and only if ''X'' is normal and every closed set is a [[G-delta set|''G''&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; set]]. Equivalently, ''X'' is perfectly normal if and only if every closed set is a [[zero set]]. Every perfectly normal space is automatically completely normal.&lt;ref name="Munkres p213"&gt;{{harvnb|Munkres|2000|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Hausdorff perfectly normal space ''X'' is a '''T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; space''', or '''perfectly T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space'''.

Note that the terms "normal space" and "T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;" and derived concepts occasionally have a different meaning. (Nonetheless, "T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;" always means the same as "completely T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;", whatever that may be.) The definitions given here are the ones usually used today. For more on this issue, see [[History of the separation axioms]].

Terms like "normal [[regular space]]" and "normal Hausdorff space" also turn up in the literature&amp;nbsp;– they simply mean that the space both is normal and satisfies the other condition mentioned. In particular, a normal Hausdorff space is the same thing as a T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space. Given the historical confusion of the meaning of the terms, verbal descriptions when applicable are helpful, that is, "normal Hausdorff" instead of "T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;", or "completely normal Hausdorff" instead of "T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;".

[[Fully normal space]]s and [[paracompact Hausdorff space|fully T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space]]s are discussed elsewhere; they are related to [[paracompactness]].

A [[locally normal space]] is a topological space where every point has an open neighbourhood that is normal. Every normal space is locally normal, but the converse is not true. A classical example of a completely regular locally normal space that is not normal is the [[Nemytskii plane]].

== Examples of normal spaces ==
Most spaces encountered in [[mathematical analysis]] are normal Hausdorff spaces, or at least normal regular spaces:
* All [[metric spaces]] (and hence all [[metrizable space]]s) are perfectly normal Hausdorff;
* All [[pseudometric space]]s (and hence all [[pseudometrisable space]]s) are perfectly normal regular, although not in general Hausdorff;
* All [[compact space|compact]] Hausdorff spaces are normal;
* In particular, the [[Stone–Čech compactification]] of a [[Tychonoff space]] is normal Hausdorff;
* Generalizing the above examples, all [[paracompact]] Hausdorff spaces are normal, and all paracompact regular spaces are normal;
* All paracompact [[topological manifold]]s are perfectly normal Hausdorff. However, there exist non-paracompact manifolds which are not even normal.
* All [[order topology|order topologies]] on [[totally ordered set]]s are hereditarily normal and Hausdorff.
* Every regular [[second-countable space]] is completely normal, and every regular [[Lindelöf space]] is normal.

Also, all [[fully normal space]]s are normal (even if not regular). [[Sierpinski space]] is an example of a normal space that is not regular.

== Examples of non-normal spaces ==
An important example of a non-normal topology is given by the [[Zariski topology]] on an [[algebraic variety]] or on the [[spectrum of a ring]], which is used in [[algebraic geometry]].

A non-normal space of some relevance to analysis is the [[topological vector space]] of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from the [[real line]] '''R''' to itself, with the [[topology of pointwise convergence]].
More generally, a theorem of [[A. H. Stone]] states that the [[product topology|product]] of [[uncountable|uncountably many]] non-[[compact space|compact]] metric spaces is never normal.

== Properties ==
Every closed subset of a normal space is normal. The continuous and closed image of a normal space is normal.&lt;ref name=GenTop&gt;{{cite book|last=Willard|first=Stephen|title=General topology.|year=1970|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|location=Reading, Mass.|isbn=0486434796|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main significance of normal spaces lies in the fact that they admit "enough" [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[real number|real]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, as expressed by the following theorems valid for any normal space ''X''.

[[Urysohn's lemma]]:
If ''A'' and ''B'' are two [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] closed subsets of ''X'', then there exists a continuous function ''f'' from ''X'' to the real line '''R''' such that ''f''(''x'') = 0 for all ''x'' in ''A'' and ''f''(''x'') = 1 for all ''x'' in ''B''.
In fact, we can take the values of ''f'' to be entirely within the [[unit interval]] [0,1].
(In fancier terms, disjoint closed sets are not only separated by neighbourhoods, but also [[separated by a function]].)

More generally, the [[Tietze extension theorem]]:
If ''A'' is a closed subset of ''X'' and ''f'' is a continuous function from ''A'' to '''R''', then there exists a continuous function ''F'': ''X'' → '''R''' which extends ''f'' in the sense that ''F''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''A''.

If '''U''' is a locally finite [[open cover]] of a normal space ''X'', then there is a [[partition of unity]] precisely subordinate to '''U'''.
(This shows the relationship of normal spaces to [[paracompactness]].)

In fact, any space that satisfies any one of these three conditions must be normal.

A [[product space|product]] of normal spaces is not necessarily normal.  This fact was first proved by [[Robert Sorgenfrey]]. An example of this phenomenon is the [[Sorgenfrey plane]]. Also, a subset of a normal space need not be normal (i.e. not every normal Hausdorff space is a completely normal Hausdorff space), since every Tychonoff space is a subset of its Stone–Čech compactification (which is normal Hausdorff).  A more explicit example is the [[Tychonoff plank]]. The only large class of product spaces of normal spaces known to be normal are the products of compact Hausdorff spaces, since both compactness ([[Tychonoff's theorem]]) and the {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} axiom are preserved under arbitrary products.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willard|1970|loc=Section 17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships to other separation axioms ==
If a normal space is [[R0 space|R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]], then it is in fact [[completely regular]].
Thus, anything from "normal R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;" to "normal completely regular" is the same as what we usually call ''normal regular''.
Taking [[Kolmogorov quotient]]s, we see that all normal [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]]s are [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]].
These are what we usually call ''normal Hausdorff'' spaces.

A topological space is said to be [[pseudonormal space|pseudonormal]] if given two disjoint closed sets in it, one of which is countable, there are disjoint open sets containing them. Every normal space is pseudonormal, but not vice versa.

Counterexamples to some variations on these statements can be found in the lists above.
Specifically, [[Sierpinski space]] is normal but not regular, while the space of functions from '''R''' to itself is Tychonoff but not normal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7529">'''Overall labor effectiveness''' ('''OLE''') is a [[key performance indicator]] (KPI) that measures the utilization, performance, and quality of the workforce and its impact on productivity.

Similar to [[overall equipment effectiveness]] (OEE), OLE measures availability, performance, and quality.
* Availability – the percentage of time employees spend making effective contributions
* Performance – the amount of product delivered
* Quality – the percentage of perfect or saleable product produced

OLE allows manufacturers to make operational decisions by giving them the ability to analyze the cumulative effect of these three workforce factors on productive output, while considering the impact of both direct and indirect labor.&lt;br /&gt;
OLE supports Lean and Six Sigma methodologies and applies them to workforce processes, allowing manufacturers to make labor-related activities more efficient, repeatable and impactful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=RP news wires|first=Noria Corporation|title=New KPI measures plants' overall labor effectiveness|url=http://www.reliableplant.com/Read/6388/new-kpi-measures-plants'-overall-labor-effectiveness|accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring availability ==
There are many factors that influence workforce availability and therefore the potential output of equipment and the manufacturing plant. OLE can help manufacturers be sure that they have the person with the right skills available at the right time by enabling manufacturers to locate areas where providing and scheduling the right mix of employees can increase the number of productive hours. OLE also accounts for labor utilization. Understanding where [[downtime]] losses are coming from and the impact they have on production can reveal root causes—which can include machine downtime, material delays, or [[absenteeism]]—that delay a line startup.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Calculation: Availability = Time operators are working productively / Time scheduled&lt;br /&gt;
Example:&lt;br /&gt;
Two employees (workforce) are scheduled to work 8 hour (480 minutes) shifts.&lt;br /&gt;
The normal shift includes a scheduled 30 minute break.&lt;br /&gt;
The employees experience 60 minutes of unscheduled downtime.&lt;br /&gt;
Scheduled Time = 960 min − 60 min break = 900 Min&lt;br /&gt;
Available Time = 900 min Scheduled − 120 min Unscheduled Downtime = 780 Min&lt;br /&gt;
Availability = 780 Avail Min / 900 Scheduled Min = 86.67%

== Measuring performance ==
When employees cannot perform their work within standard times, performance can suffer. Effective training can increase performance by improving the skills that directly impact the quality of output.  A skilled operator knows how to measure work, understands the impacts of variability, and knows to stop production for corrective actions when quality falls below specified limits.  Accurately measuring this metric with OLE can pinpoint performance improvement opportunities down to the individual level.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Calculation: Performance = Actual output of the operators / the expected output (or labor standard)&lt;br /&gt;
Example:&lt;br /&gt;
Two employees (workforce) are scheduled to work an 8-hour (480 minute) shift with a 30-minute scheduled break.&lt;br /&gt;
Available Time = 960 min − 60 min break − 120 min Unscheduled Downtime = 780 Min

The Standard Rate for the part being produced is 60 Units/Hour or 1 Minute/Unit&lt;br /&gt;
The Workforce produces 700 Total Units during the shift.&lt;br /&gt;
Time to Produce Parts = 700 Units * 1 Minutes/Unit = 700 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;
Performance = 700 minutes / 780 minutes = 89.74 %

== Measuring quality ==
A number of drivers contribute to quality, but the effort to improve quality can result in a lowering of labor performance.  When making the correlation between the workforce and quality it is important to consider factors such as the training and skills of employees, whether they have access to the right tools to follow procedures, and their understanding of how their roles drive and impact quality. OLE can help manufacturers analyze shift productivity down to a single-shift level, and determine which individual workers are most productive, and then identify corrective actions to bring operations up to standards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Calculation: Quality = Saleable parts / Total parts produced&lt;br /&gt;
Example:&lt;br /&gt;
Two employees (workforce) produce 670 Good Units during a shift.&lt;br /&gt;
700 Units were started in order to produce the 670 Good Units.&lt;br /&gt;
Quality = 670 Good Units / 700 Units Started = 95.71%

== Calculation ==
Effective use of OLE uncovers the data that fuels root-cause analysis and points to corrective actions.  Likewise, OLE exposes trends that can be used to diagnose more subtle problems.  It also helps managers understand whether corrective actions did, in fact, solve problems and improve overall productivity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Example:&lt;br /&gt;
Calculation: OLE = Availability x Performance x Quality&lt;br /&gt;
Example:&lt;br /&gt;
A workforce experiences...&lt;br /&gt;
Availability of 87%&lt;br /&gt;
The Work Center Performance is 89.74%.&lt;br /&gt;
Work Center Quality is 96%.&lt;br /&gt;
OLE = 86.67% Availability x 89.74% Performance x 95.71% Quality = 74,44%

== Labor information tracked ==
The following table provides examples of the labor information tracked by overall labor effectiveness organized by its major categories. Using this labor information, manufacturers can make operational decisions to improve the cumulative effect of labor availability, performance, and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Gregg|title=Lean Labor Strategies|year=2011|publisher=Kronos Publishing|location=page 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nguyen|first=Mark|title=How Ceradyne Increased Productivity through Effective Labor Management|url=http://www.industryweek.com/articles/how_ceradyne_increased_productivity_through_effective_labor_management_15996.aspx?ShowAll=1|publisher=IndustryWeek|accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gopinathan Nair was born on 7 July 1922 to M. Padmanabha Pillai and K. P. Janaki Amma in [[Neyyattinkara]], a town in the southern part of [[Thiruvananthapuram district]] of the south Indian state of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref name="A Gandhian turns 90 on Thursday" /&gt; After completing his school education at the Government High School, Neyyattinkara, he did his graduate studies in science at the [[University College, Thiruvananthapuram]] and it was during this period, he participated in the [[Quit India movement]].&lt;ref name="2005 Jamnalal Bajaj Award for Constructive Work"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jamnalalbajajfoundation.org/awards/archives/2005/constructive-work/gopinathan-nair | title=2005 Jamnalal Bajaj Award for Constructive Work | publisher=Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation | date=2016 | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he founded ''Trivandrum Students Settlement'' gathering 35 students, inspired by the ''Construction movement'' of Mahatma Gandhi.

A '''persistent vegetative state''' ('''PVS''') is a [[disorder of consciousness]] in which patients with severe [[brain damage]] are in a state of partial [[arousal]] rather than true [[awareness]]. After four weeks in a vegetative state (VS), the patient is classified as in a persistent vegetative state. This diagnosis is classified as a ''permanent vegetative state'' some months (3 in the US and 6 in the UK) after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. Nowadays, more doctors and neuroscientists prefer to call the state of consciousness an''syndrome'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laureys|first=Steven|last2=Celesia|first2=Gastone G|last3=Cohadon|first3=Francois|last4=Lavrijsen|first4=Jan|last5=León-Carrión|first5=José|last6=Sannita|first6=Walter G|last7=Sazbon|first7=Leon|last8=Schmutzhard|first8=Erich|last9=von Wild|first9=Klaus R|date=2010-11-01|title=Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome: a new name for the vegetative state or apallic syndrome|journal=BMC Medicine|volume=8|pages=68|doi=10.1186/1741-7015-8-68|issn=1741-7015|pmc=2987895|pmid=21040571}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily because of ethical questions about whether a patient can be called "vegetative" or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laureys S, Celesia GG, Cohadon F, Lavrijsen J, León-Carrión J, Sannita WG, Sazbon L, Schmutzhard E, von Wild KR, Zeman A, Dolce G | year = 2010 | title = Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome: a new name for the vegetative state or apallic syndrome | url = | journal = BMC Med. | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 68 | doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-8-68 | pmid = 21040571 | pmc=2987895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
There are several definitions that vary by technical versus layman's usage. There are different legal implications in different countries.

===Medical definition===
A wakeful unconscious state that lasts longer than a few weeks is referred to as a persistent (or 'continuing') vegetative state.&lt;ref name="rcplondon.ac.uk"&gt;Royal College of Physicians 2013 Prolonged Disorders of Consciousness:  National Clinical Guidelines, https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/resources/prolonged-disorders-consciousness-national-clinical-guidelines&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of legal clarity===
Unlike [[brain death]], permanent vegetative state (PVS) is recognized by  ''[[statute law]]'' as [[death]] in very few legal systems. In the US, courts have required petitions before termination of life support that demonstrate that any recovery of cognitive functions above a vegetative state is assessed as impossible by authoritative medical opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1116645 | pmid=10496803|year=1999|last1=Jennett|first1=B|title=Should cases of permanent vegetative state still go to court?. Britain should follow other countries and keep the courts for cases of dispute|volume=319|issue=7213|pages=796–97|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7213.796}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In England and Wales the legal precedent for withdrawal of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration in cases of patients in a PVS was set in 1993 in the case of [[Tony Bland]], who sustained catastrophic anoxic brain injury in the [[Hillsborough disaster|1989 Hillsborough disaster]].&lt;ref name="rcplondon.ac.uk"/&gt;  An application to the Court of Protection is no longer required before nutrition and hydration can be withdrawn or withheld from PVS (or 'minimally conscious' - MCS) patients.&lt;ref&gt;Royal College of Physicians 2013 [https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/resources/prolonged-disorders-consciousness-national-clinical-guidelines Prolonged Disorders of Consciousness:  National Clinical Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

This legal [[wikt:grey area|grey area]] has led to vocal advocates that those in PVS should be [[Euthanasia|allowed to die]]. Others are equally determined that, if recovery is at all possible, care should continue. The existence of a small number of diagnosed PVS cases that have eventually resulted in improvement makes defining recovery as "impossible" particularly difficult in a legal sense.&lt;ref name="searchmedica.com"&gt;[http://www.searchmedica.com/resource.html?rurl=http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2004/08/cprl1-0408.html&amp;q=Persistent+Vegetative+State&amp;c=pc&amp;ss=defLink&amp;p=Convera&amp;ds=0&amp;srid=2 Diagnosing The Permanent Vegetative State by Ronald Cranford, MD]&lt;/ref&gt;  This legal and ethical issue raises questions about autonomy, quality of life, appropriate use of resources, the wishes of family members, and professional responsibilities.

===Vegetative state===

The vegetative state is a chronic or long-term condition. This condition differs from a [[coma]]: a coma is a state that lacks both awareness and wakefulness. Patients in a vegetative state may have awoken from a coma, but still have not regained awareness. In the vegetative state patients can open their eyelids occasionally and demonstrate sleep-wake cycles, but completely lack cognitive function. The vegetative state is also called a "coma vigil". The chances of regaining awareness diminish considerably as the time spent in the vegetative state increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PVS|first=The Multi-Society Task Force on|date=1994-05-26|title=Medical Aspects of the Persistent Vegetative State|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199405263302107|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=330|issue=21|pages=1499–1508|doi=10.1056/NEJM199405263302107|issn=0028-4793|pmid=7818633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistent vegetative state===

Persistent vegetative state is the standard usage (except in the UK) for a medical diagnosis, made after numerous neurological and other tests, that due to extensive and irreversible brain damage a patient is ''highly unlikely'' ever to achieve higher functions above a vegetative state. This diagnosis does not mean that a doctor has diagnosed improvement as impossible, but does open the possibility, in the US, for a judicial request to end life support.&lt;ref name="searchmedica.com"/&gt; Informal guidelines hold that this diagnosis can be made after four weeks in a vegetative state. US caselaw has shown that successful petitions for termination have been made after a diagnosis of a persistent vegetative state, although in some cases, such as that of [[Terri Schiavo]], such rulings have generated widespread controversy.

In the UK, the term 'persistent vegetative state' is discouraged in favor of two more precisely defined terms that have been strongly recommended by the [[Royal College of Physicians|Royal College of Physicians (RCP)]].  These guidelines recommend using a '''continuous vegetative state''' for patients in a vegetative state for more than four weeks.  A medical definition of a '''permanent vegetative state''' can be made if, after exhaustive testing and a customary 12 months of observation,&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1116668 | pmid=10496834|year=1999|last1=Wade|first1=DT|last2=Johnston|first2=C|title=The permanent vegetative state: Practical guidance on diagnosis and management|volume=319|issue=7213|pages=841–4|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7213.841}}&lt;/ref&gt; a medical diagnosis that it is ''impossible'' by any informed medical expectations that the mental condition will ever improve.&lt;ref name="rcp"&gt;{{cite book | title=Guidance on diagnosis and management: Report of a working party of the Royal College of Physicians | publisher=[[Royal College of Physicians]]: London | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a "continuous vegetative state" in the UK may remain the diagnosis in cases that would be called "persistent" in the US or elsewhere.

While the actual testing criteria for a diagnosis of "permanent" in the UK are quite similar to the criteria for a diagnosis of "persistent" in the US, the semantic difference imparts in the UK a ''legal'' presumption that is commonly used in court applications for ending life support.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;  The UK diagnosis is generally only made after 12 months of observing a static vegetative state. A diagnosis of a persistent vegetative state in the US usually still requires a petitioner to prove in court that recovery is impossible by informed medical opinion, while in the UK the "permanent" diagnosis already gives the petitioner this presumption and may make the legal process less time-consuming.&lt;ref name="searchmedica.com"/&gt;

In common usage, the "permanent" and "persistent" definitions are sometimes conflated and used interchangeably. However, the acronym "PVS" is intended to define a "persistent vegetative state", without necessarily the connotations of permanence, and is used as such throughout this article.

[[Bryan Jennett]], who originally coined the term "persistent vegetative state", has now recommended using the UK division between continuous and permanent in his most recent book ''[[The Vegetative State]]''.  This is one for purposes of precision, on the grounds that "the 'persistent' component of this term ... may seem to suggest irreversibility".&lt;ref name="Jennett"/&gt;

The Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] has suggested "post coma unresponsiveness" as an alternative term for "vegetative state" in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Post-coma unresponsiveness (Vegetative State): a clinical framework for diagnosis | publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC): Canberra | year=2003 | url=http://www.health.gov.au/nhmrc/publications/synopses/hpr23syn.htm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820035510/http://www7.health.gov.au/nhmrc/publications/synopses/hpr23syn.htm | archivedate=2006-08-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Most PVS patients are unresponsive to external stimuli and their conditions are associated with different levels of consciousness. Some level of consciousness means a person can still respond, in varying degrees, to stimulation. A person in a coma, however, cannot. In addition, PVS patients often open their eyes in response to feeding, which has to be done by others; they are capable of swallowing, whereas patients in a coma subsist with their eyes closed (Emmett, 1989).

Cerebral cortical function (e.g. communication, thinking, purposeful movement, etc) is lost while brainstem functions (e.g. breathing, maintaining circulation and hemodynamic stability, etc) are preserved.  Non-cognitive upper brainstem functions such as eye-opening, occasional vocalizations (e.g. crying, laughing), maintaining normal sleep patterns, and spontaneous non-purposeful movements often remain intact.   

PVS patients' eyes might be in a relatively fixed position, or track moving objects, or move in a ''[[Vergence|disconjugate]]'' (i.e., completely unsynchronized) manner. They may experience [[sleep]]-wake cycles, or be in a state of chronic wakefulness. They may exhibit some behaviors that can be construed as arising from partial consciousness, such as grinding their teeth, swallowing, smiling, shedding tears, grunting, moaning, or screaming without any apparent external [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]].

Individuals in PVS are seldom on any life-sustaining equipment other than a [[feeding tube]] because the [[brainstem]], the center of vegetative functions (such as heart rate and rhythm, respiration, and [[gastrointestinal]] activity) is relatively intact (Emmett, 1989).

===Recovery===
Many people emerge spontaneously from a vegetative state within a few weeks.&lt;ref name="Jennett"/&gt; The chances of recovery depend on the extent of injury to the brain and the patient's age – younger patients having a better chance of recovery than older patients. A 1994 report found that of those who were in a vegetative state a month after a trauma, 54% had regained consciousness by a year after the trauma, whereas 28% had died and 18% were still in the vegetative state. But for non-traumatic injuries such as [[stroke]]s, only 14% had recovered consciousness at one year, 47% had died, and 39% were still vegetative. Patients who were vegetative six months after the initial event were much less likely to have recovered consciousness a year after the event than in the case of those who were simply reported vegetative at one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jennett | first1 = B | year=2002 | title=Editorial: The vegetative state.

The longer a patient is in a PVS, the more severe the resulting disabilities are likely to be. Rehabilitation can contribute to recovery, but many patients never progress to the point of being able to take care of themselves.

There are two dimensions of recovery from a persistent vegetative state: recovery of [[consciousness]] and recovery of function. Recovery of consciousness can be verified by reliable evidence of [[awareness]] of self and the environment, consistent voluntary behavioral responses to visual and auditory stimuli, and interaction with others. Recovery of function is characterized by communication, the ability to learn and to perform adaptive tasks, mobility, self-care, and participation in recreational or vocational activities. Recovery of consciousness may occur without functional recovery, but functional recovery cannot occur without recovery of consciousness (Ashwal, 1994).

== Causes ==
There are three main causes of PVS (persistent vegetative state):
# Acute [[traumatic brain injury]]
# Non-traumatic: [[neurodegenerative disorder]] or [[metabolic disorder]] of the brain
# Severe congenital abnormality of the [[central nervous system]]

Medical books (such as Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins. (2007). In A Page: Pediatric Signs and Symptoms) describe several potential causes of PVS, which are as follows:

* Bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, including [[meningitis]]
*Increased intracranial pressure, such as a [[tumor]] or [[abscess]]
*Vascular pressure which causes intracranial hemorrhaging or stroke
*Hypoxic ischemic injury ([[hypotension]], [[cardiac arrest]], [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], near-drowning)
*Toxins such as uremia, [[ethanol]], [[atropine]], [[opiates]], [[lead]], [[colloidal silver]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15111684 | volume=62 | issue=8 | title=Myoclonic status epilepticus following repeated oral ingestion of colloidal silver |date=April 2004 |vauthors=Mirsattari SM, Hammond RR, Sharpe MD, Leung FY, Young GB | journal=Neurology | pages=1408–10 | doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000120671.73335.EC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Trauma: Concussion, contusion
*Seizure, both nonconvulsive status epilepticus and postconvulsive state (postictal state)
*Electrolyte imbalance, which involves [[hyponatremia]], [[hypernatremia]], [[hypomagnesemia]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hyperglycemia]], [[hypercalcemia]], and [[hypocalcemia]]
*Postinfectious: [[Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]] (ADEM)
*Endocrine disorders such as adrenal insufficiency and thyroid disorders
*Degenerative and [[metabolic disease]]s including urea cycle disorders, [[Reye syndrome]], and mitochondrial disease
*Systemic infection and [[sepsis]]
*[[Hepatic encephalopathy]]

In addition, these authors claim that doctors sometimes use the [[mnemonic]] device AEIOU-TIPS to recall portions of the differential diagnosis: Alcohol ingestion and acidosis, Epilepsy and encephalopathy, Infection, Opiates, Uremia, Trauma, Insulin overdose or inflammatory disorders, Poisoning and psychogenic causes, and Shock.

== Diagnosis ==
Despite converging agreement about the definition of persistent vegetative state, recent reports have raised concerns about the accuracy of diagnosis in some patients, and the extent to which, in a selection of cases, residual [[cognitive]] functions may remain undetected and patients are diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state. Objective assessment of residual cognitive function can be extremely difficult as motor responses may be minimal, inconsistent, and difficult to document in many patients, or may be undetectable in others because no cognitive output is possible (Owen et al., 2002). In recent years, a number of studies have demonstrated an important role for [[functional neuroimaging]] in the identification of residual cognitive function in persistent vegetative state; this technology is providing new insights into [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] activity in patients with severe brain damage. Such studies, when successful, may be particularly useful where there is concern about the accuracy of the diagnosis and the possibility that residual cognitive function has remained undetected.

===Diagnostic experiments===
Researchers have begun to use functional neuroimaging studies to study implicit cognitive processing in patients with a clinical diagnosis of persistent vegetative state. Activations in response to sensory stimuli with [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), and [[electrophysiological]] methods can provide information on the presence, degree, and location of any residual brain function. However, use of these techniques in people with severe brain damage is methodologically, clinically, and theoretically complex and needs careful quantitative analysis and interpretation.

For example, PET studies have shown the identification of residual cognitive function in persistent vegetative state. That is, an external stimulation, such as a painful stimulus, still activates "primary" sensory cortices in these patients but these areas are functionally disconnected from "higher order" associative areas needed for awareness. These results show that parts of the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] are indeed still functioning in "vegetative" patients (Matsuda et al., 2003).

In addition, other PET studies have revealed preserved and consistent responses in predicted regions of [[auditory cortex]] in response to intelligible speech stimuli. Moreover, a preliminary fMRI examination revealed partially intact responses to semantically ambiguous stimuli, which are known to tap higher aspects of speech comprehension (Boly, 2004).

Furthermore, several studies have used PET to assess the central processing of [[Poison|noxious]] [[somatosensory]] stimuli in patients in PVS. Noxious somatosensory stimulation activated [[midbrain]], contralateral [[thalamus]], and [[primary somatosensory cortex]] in each and every PVS patient, even in the absence of detectable cortical [[evoked potential]]s. In conclusion, somatosensory stimulation of PVS patients, at intensities that elicited pain in controls, resulted in increased neuronal activity in primary somatosensory cortex, even if resting brain metabolism was severely impaired. However, this activation of primary cortex seems to be isolated and dissociated from higher-order associative cortices (Laureys et al., 2002).

Also, there is evidence of partially functional cerebral regions in catastrophically injured brains. To study five patients in PVS with different behavioral features, researchers employed PET, MRI and [[magnetoencephalographic]] (MEG) responses to sensory stimulation. In three of the five patients, co-registered [[PET/MRI]] correlate areas of relatively preserved brain metabolism with isolated fragments of behavior. Two patients had suffered [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxic]] injuries and demonstrated marked decreases in overall cerebral metabolism to 30–40% of normal. Two other patients with non-anoxic, multifocal brain injuries demonstrated several isolated brain regions with higher [[metabolic]] rates, that ranged up to 50–80% of normal. Nevertheless, their global metabolic rates remained &lt;50% of normal. MEG recordings from three PVS patients provide clear evidence for the absence, abnormality or reduction of evoked responses. Despite major abnormalities, however, these data also provide evidence for localized residual activity at the [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] level. Each patient partially preserved restricted sensory representations, as evidenced by slow evoked magnetic fields and gamma band activity. In two patients, these activations correlate with isolated behavioral patterns and metabolic activity. Remaining active regions identified in the three PVS patients with behavioral fragments appear to consist of segregated corticothalamic networks that retain connectivity and partial functional integrity. A single patient who suffered severe injury to the tegmental [[mesencephalon]] and paramedian [[thalamus]] showed widely preserved cortical metabolism, and a global average metabolic rate of 65% of normal. The relatively high preservation of cortical metabolism in this patient defines the first functional correlate of clinical– pathological reports associating permanent unconsciousness with structural damage to these regions. The specific patterns of preserved metabolic activity identified in these patients reflect novel evidence of the modular nature of individual functional networks that underlie conscious brain function. The variations in cerebral metabolism in chronic PVS patients indicate that some cerebral regions can retain partial function in catastrophically injured brains (Schiff et al., 2002).

=== Misdiagnoses ===
Statistical PVS misdiagnosis isn't uncommon. An example study with 40 patients in the [[United Kingdom]] reported 43% of their patients classified as PVS were believed so and another 33% had recovered whilst the study was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=K Andrews |author2=L Murphy |author3=R Munday |author4=C Littlewood | title=Misdiagnosis of the vegetative state: retrospective study in a rehabilitation unit | journal=[[British Medical Journal]] | volume=313 | pages=13–16 | date=1996-07-06 | pmid=8664760 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/313/7048/13 | issue=7048 | pmc=2351462 | doi=10.1136/bmj.313.7048.13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some PVS cases may actually be a misdiagnosis of patients being in an undiagnosed [[minimally conscious state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Giacino JT | title=Unknown title | journal=Neurology | volume=58 | year=2002 | pages=349–353 | pmid=11839831 | issue=3 |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors=1 | last2=Ashwal | first2=S | last3=Childs | first3=N | last4=Cranford | first4=R | last5=Jennett | first5=B | last6=Katz | first6=DI | last7=Kelly | first7=JP | last8=Rosenberg | first8=JH | last9=Whyte | first9=J | doi=10.1212/wnl.58.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the exact diagnostic criteria of the minimally conscious state were only formulated in 2002, there may be chronic patients diagnosed as PVS before the secondary notion of the minimally conscious state became known.

Whether or not there is any conscious awareness with a patient's vegetative state is a prominent issue.  Three completely different aspects of this should be distinguished. First, some patients can be conscious simply because they are misdiagnosed (see above). In fact, they are not in vegetative states. Second, sometimes a patient was correctly diagnosed but is then examined during the early stages of recovery. Third, perhaps some day the notion itself of vegetative states will change so to include elements of conscious awareness. Inability to disentangle these three example cases causes confusion. An example of such confusion is the response to a recent experiment using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] which revealed that a woman diagnosed with PVS was able to activate predictable portions of her brain in response to the tester's requests that she imagine herself playing tennis or moving from room to room in her house. The brain activity in response to these instructions was indistinguishable from those of healthy patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Owen AM, Coleman MR, Boly M, Davis MH, Laureys S, Pickard JD | title=Detecting awareness in the vegetative state | journal=Science | volume=313 | issue=5792 | page=1402 | date=2006-09-08 | doi=10.1126/science.1130197 | pmid=16959998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC news "&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/5320234.stm | title= Vegetative patient 'communicates': A patient in a vegetative state can communicate just through using her thoughts, according to research | date= September 7, 2006| publisher=BBC News | accessdate=2008-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/09/08/MNGI9L1IM81.DTL | title=Vegetative patient's brain active  in test: Unprecedented experiment shows response to instructions to imagine playing tennis | author=Stein R | date=September 8, 2006 | publisher= ''San Francisco Chronicle''| accessdate=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Martin Monti and fellow researchers, working at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the [[University of Cambridge]], reported in an article in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/362/7/579 Willful Modulation of Brain Activity in Disorders of Consciousness at nejm.org]&lt;/ref&gt; that some patients in persistent vegetative states responded to verbal instructions by displaying different patterns of brain activity on [[fMRI]] scans. Five out of a total of 54 diagnosed patients were apparently able to respond when instructed to think about one of two different physical activities. One of these five was also able to "answer" yes or no questions, again by imagining one of these two activities.&lt;ref name="alleynebeckford"&gt;Richard Alleyne and Martin Beckford, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7150119/Patients-in-vegetative-state-can-think-and-communicate.html Patients in 'vegetative' state can think and communicate],''Telegraph'' (United Kingdom), Feb 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear, however, whether the fact that portions of the patients' brains light up on [[fMRI]] could help these patients assume their own medical decision making.&lt;ref name="alleynebeckford"/&gt;

In November 2011, a publication in ''The Lancet'' presented bedside EEG apparatus and indicated that its signal could be used to detect awareness in three of 16 patients diagnosed in the vegetative state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cruse Damian| title = Bedside detection of awareness in the vegetative state: a cohort study | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 378| issue = 9809| pages = 2088–2094| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61224-5 |display-authors=etal | pmid=22078855 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Currently no treatment for vegetative state exists that would satisfy the efficacy criteria of [[evidence-based medicine]]. Several methods have been proposed which can roughly be subdivided into four categories: pharmacological methods, surgery, physical therapy, and various stimulation techniques. Pharmacological therapy mainly uses activating substances such as [[tricyclic antidepressants]] or [[methylphenidate]]. Mixed results have been reported using dopaminergic drugs such as [[amantadine]] and [[bromocriptine]] and stimulants such as [[dextroamphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolce|first1=Giuliano|last2=Sazbon|first2=Leon|title=The post-traumatic vegetative state|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_post_traumatic_vegetative_state.html?id=tvY4pNyemisC|isbn=9781588901163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgical methods such as deep brain stimulation are used less frequently due to the invasiveness of the procedures. Stimulation techniques include sensory stimulation, sensory regulation, music and musicokinetic therapy, social-tactile interaction, and cortical stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Georgiopoulos M, etal | year = 2010 | title = Vegetative state and minimally conscious state: a review of the therapeutic interventions | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/314354 | journal = Stereotact Funct Neurosurg | volume = 88 | issue = 4| pages = 199–207 | pmid = 20460949 | doi=10.1159/000314354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zolpidem===
There is limited evidence that the hypnotic drug [[zolpidem]] has an effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Georgiopoulos|first1=M|author2=Katsakiori, P; Kefalopoulou, Z; Ellul, J; Chroni, E; Constantoyannis, C|title=Vegetative state and minimally conscious state: a review of the therapeutic interventions.|journal=Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery|year=2010|volume=88|issue=4|pages=199–207|pmid=20460949|doi=10.1159/000314354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the few scientific studies that have been published so far on the effectiveness of zolpidem have been contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Epidemiology==
In the [[United States]], it is estimated that there may be between 15,000 and 40,000 patients who are in a persistent vegetative state, but due to poor nursing home records exact figures are hard to determine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hirsch, Joy |  title=Raising consciousness | volume=115 | issue=5 | date=2005-05-02 | page=1102 | publisher=American Society for Clinical Investigation |url=http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/115/5/1102 |  doi=10.1172/JCI25320 | pmid=15864333 | pmc=1087197 | journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The syndrome was first described in 1940 by [[Ernst Kretschmer]] who called it ''apallic syndrome''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF02871384 | author=Ernst Kretschmer | title=Das apallische Syndrom | journal=Neurol. Psychiat | volume=169 | pages=576–579 | year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''persistent vegetative state'' was coined in 1972 by [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Vertebral column|spinal]] [[surgeon]] [[Bryan Jennett]] and [[United States|American]] [[neurologist]] [[Fred Plum]] to describe a syndrome that seemed to have been made possible by [[medicine]]'s increased capacities to keep patients' bodies alive.&lt;ref name="Jennett"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bryan Jennett | title=The Vegetative State: Medical facts, ethical and legal dilemmas | publisher=University of Glasgow: Scotland | url=http://assets.cambridge.org/052144/1587/sample/0521441587ws.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jennett1972"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B Jennett |author2=F Plum | title=Persistent vegetative state after brain damage: A syndrome in search of a name | journal=[[The Lancet]] | volume=1 | issue=7753 | pages=734–737 | year=1972 | pmid=4111204 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(72)90242-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Ethics and policy===
An ongoing debate exists as to how much care, if any, patients in a persistent vegetative state should receive in health systems plagued by limited resources.  In a case before the New Jersey Superior Court, ''[[Betancourt v. Trinitas Hospital]]'', a community hospital sought a ruling that dialysis and CPR for such a patient constitutes futile care.  An American bioethicist, [[Jacob M. Appel]], argued that any money spent treating PVS patients would be better spent on other patients with a higher likelihood of recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medicalfutility.blogspot.com/ Appel on Betancourt v. Trinitas]&lt;/ref&gt;
The patient died naturally prior to a decision in the case, resulting in the court finding the issue [[mootness|moot]].

In 2010, British and Belgian researchers reported in an article in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' that some patients in persistent vegetative states actually had enough consciousness to "answer" yes or no questions on [[fMRI]] scans.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;Richard Alleyne and Martin Beckford, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7150119/Patients-in-vegetative-state-can-think-and-communicate.html Patients in 'vegetative' state can think and communicate], ''Telegraph'' (United Kingdom), Feb 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear whether the fact that portions of the patients' brains light up on [[fMRI]] will help these patient assume their own medical decision making.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Professor Geraint Rees, Director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, responded to the study by observing that, "As a clinician, it would be important to satisfy oneself that the individual that you are communicating with is competent to make those decisions. At the moment it is premature to conclude that the individual able to answer 5 out of 6 yes/no questions is fully conscious like you or I."&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; In contrast, [[Jacob M. Appel]] of the [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] told the ''Telegraph'' that this development could be a welcome step toward clarifying the wishes of such patients. Appel stated: "I see no reason why, if we are truly convinced such patients are communicating, society should not honour their wishes. In fact, as a physician, I think a compelling case can be made that doctors have an ethical obligation to assist such patients by removing treatment. I suspect that, if such individuals are indeed trapped in their bodies, they may be living in great torment and will request to have their care terminated or even active euthanasia."&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

'''''Planet Earth: The Future''''' is a 2006 [[BBC]] [[documentary]] series on the environment and conservation, produced by the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] as a companion to the multi-award winning [[nature documentary]] ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]''. The programmes were originally [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on [[BBC Four]] immediately after the final three episodes of ''Planet Earth'' on [[BBC One]]. Each episode highlights the conservation issues surrounding some of the [[species]] and environments featured in ''Planet Earth'', using interviews with the film-makers and eminent figures from the fields of [[science]], [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]], [[politics]], and [[theology]]. The programmes are narrated by Simon Poland and the series producer was [[Fergus Beeley]].

==Background==
When the first episodes of ''Planet Earth'' were broadcast in the [[UK]], the producers were criticised by some green campaigners for glossing over the [[environmental problem]]s faced by the planet. Executive producer [[Alastair Fothergill]] defended the approach, explaining that a heavy-handed environmental message would not work on primetime [[BBC One]]. However, the ''Planet Earth'' film crews witnessed first-hand scenes of [[environmental degradation]] and the increasing scarcity of wildlife in some of the shooting locations. This experience formed the basis of ''Planet Earth - The Future'', which was designed to engage viewers in a mature debate about [[environmental issues]].

The following year, the BBC commissioned ''[[Saving Planet Earth]]'', the second overtly conservation-themed series to be shown on [[BBC One]]. The first BBC series to deal comprehensively with conservation was ''[[State of the Planet]]'' in 2000.

 |ShortSummary    = The first programme asks if there really is an [[extinction]] crisis facing certain species. Alastair Fothergill, executive producer of ''Planet Earth'', admits that making the series was a bittersweet experience since some creatures were filmed with the knowledge that their continued existence is under threat. David Attenborough believes that conservation of the [[natural environment|natural world]] is something that can unite humanity if people know enough about it. Cameraman Martyn Colbeck relates that every single day during a six-week [[Africa]]n visit to film for "Jungles", he and his crew were awakened by the sound of gunshots. [[Poaching]] can quickly wipe out a population, and David Greer of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] explains that in 2005 his team confiscated 70 guns in the area — a 700% increase from 1999. Other featured animals at risk include the [[walia ibex]], the [[snow leopard]], the [[boto]], and [[saiga antelope]]. The attack of a [[polar bear]] on a [[walrus]] colony on dry land in "Ice Worlds" was a rare occurrence. Footage from a 1997 ''[[BBC Wildlife Specials|BBC Wildlife Special]]'' shows the bears hunting smaller prey on sea ice. Species have always become extinct, but now, the viewer is told, the rate of extinction is accelerating (see [[Holocene extinction]]) and it will "really reach biblical proportions within a few decades." Mankind is urged to respect [[biodiversity]]: it is estimated that if a monetary value could be put on all that the world's [[ecosystem]]s do for humanity, it would total some [[US$]]30 trillion.

 |Title           = Into the Wilderness
 |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|12|03|df=y}}
 |ShortSummary    = The second part looks at man's potential effect on the world's areas of [[wilderness]]. As the [[human population]] has grown, only a quarter of Earth's land now remains uninhabited (aside from [[Antarctica]]). Although around 12% is protected, this may not be enough — providing such places are not just 'enclosures' and bordering territories are also managed. [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Semien Mountains]] are increasingly encroached upon for farming land, and this example leads to the question of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. Some interviewees argue that it is not just about numbers: how humans consume their [[natural resources]] is also important. However, others believe that the world would be greatly more sustainable if the population level was reduced to about half its current level. [[Jonathon Porritt]] believes that this could be achieved simply: by good education on [[family planning]]. Consumption of [[fresh water]] is highlighted: there are now 40,000 more dams in existence than in 1950. The controversy over drilling for oil in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] is discussed by both its advocates and opponents. [[E. O. Wilson]]'s concept of [[Biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] is discussed, and David Attenborough believes that a child's innate love of wildlife, for whatever reason, is being lost in adulthood. An answer to [[deforestation]] is found in [[Costa Rica]], where farmers are paid to allow their pasture to revert to forest for its water [[ecosystem services]]. The also deals with [[climate change]] and related [[global warming]], which is now happening at a faster rate than ever before.

 |Title           = Living Together
 |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|12|10|df=y}}
 |ShortSummary    = The last episode deals with the future of conservation. It begins by looking at previous efforts. The 'Save The Whales' campaign, which started in the 1960s, is seen to have had a limited effect, as [[whaling]] continues and fish stocks also decline. In the 1990s, as head of the [[Kenya Wildlife Service]], [[Richard Leakey]] took on the poachers by employing armed units. Although it was successful in saving [[elephant]]s, the policy was detrimental to the [[Maasai people]], who were forced from their land. The need for "fortress" areas is questioned, and the recently highlighted [[Raja Ampat]] [[coral reef]] in [[Indonesia]] is an example. The more [[tourism]] it generates, the greater the potential for damage — and inevitable coastal construction. [[Sustainable development]] is viewed as controversial, and one contributor perceives it to currently be a "contradiction in terms". [[Trophy hunting]] is also contentious. Those that support it argue that it generates wealth for local economies, while its opponents point to the reducing numbers of species such as the [[markhor]]. [[Ecotourism]] is shown to be beneficial, as it is in the interests of its providers to protect their environments. However, in some areas, such as the [[Borneo]] [[rainforest]]s, the great diversity of species is being replaced by [[monoculture]]s. The role of both [[Religion and environmentalism|religion]] and the media in conservation is argued to be extremely important. Contributors to the programme admit a degree of worry about the future, but also optimism.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''pointed space''' is a [[topological space]] with a distinguished point, the '''basepoint'''. The distinguished point is just simply one particular point, picked out from the space, and given a name, such as ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, that remains unchanged during subsequent discussion, and is kept track of during all operations.

Maps of pointed spaces ('''based maps''') are [[continuous (topology)|continuous maps]] preserving basepoints, i.e., a map ''f'' between a pointed space ''X'' with basepoint ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a pointed space ''Y'' with basepoint ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a based map if it is continuous with respect to the topologies of ''X'' and ''Y'' and if ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This is usually denoted
:''f'' : (''X'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;rarr; (''Y'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).
Pointed spaces are important in [[algebraic topology]], particularly in [[homotopy theory]], where many constructions, such as the [[fundamental group]], depend on a choice of basepoint.

The [[pointed set]] concept is less important; it is anyway the case of a pointed [[discrete space]].

Pointed spaces are often taken as a special case of the [[relative topology]], where the subset is a single point.  Thus, much of [[homotopy theory]] is usually developed on pointed spaces, and then moved to relative topologies in [[algebraic topology]].

==Category of pointed spaces==
The [[class (set theory)|class]] of all pointed spaces forms a [[category (mathematics)|category]] '''Top'''&lt;sub&gt;•&lt;/sub&gt; with basepoint preserving continuous maps as [[morphism]]s. Another way to think about this category is as the [[comma category]], ({•} ↓ '''Top''') where {•} is any one point space and '''Top''' is the [[category of topological spaces]]. (This is also called a [[coslice category]] denoted {•}/'''Top'''.) Objects in this category are continuous maps {•} → ''X''. Such morphisms can be thought of as picking out a basepoint in ''X''. Morphisms in ({•} ↓ '''Top''') are morphisms in '''Top''' for which the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
[[Image:PointedSpace-01.png]]
&lt;/div&gt;

It is easy to see that commutativity of the diagram is equivalent to the condition that ''f'' preserves basepoints.

As a pointed space, {•} is a [[zero object]] in '''Top'''&lt;sub&gt;•&lt;/sub&gt;, while it is only a [[terminal object]] in '''Top'''.

There is a [[forgetful functor]] '''Top'''&lt;sub&gt;•&lt;/sub&gt; → '''Top''' which "forgets" which point is the basepoint. This functor has a [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] which assigns to each topological space ''X'' the [[disjoint union]] of ''X'' and a one-point space {•} whose single element is taken to be the basepoint.

==Operations on pointed spaces==
*A '''subspace''' of a pointed space ''X'' is a [[subspace (topology)|topological subspace]] ''A'' ⊆ ''X'' which shares its basepoint with ''X'' so that the [[inclusion map]] is basepoint preserving.
*One can form the '''[[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]]''' of a pointed space ''X'' under any [[equivalence relation]]. The basepoint of the quotient is the image of the basepoint in ''X'' under the quotient map.
*One can form the '''[[product (category theory)|product]]''' of two pointed spaces (''X'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), (''Y'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) as the [[product (topology)|topological product]] ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' with (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) serving as the basepoint.
*The '''[[coproduct]]''' in the category of pointed spaces is the ''[[wedge sum]]'', which can be thought of as the 'one-point union' of spaces.
*The '''[[smash product]]''' of two pointed spaces is essentially the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of the direct product and the wedge sum. We would like to say that the smash product turns the category of pointed spaces into a [[symmetric monoidal category]] with the pointed [[0-sphere]] as the unit object, but this is false for general spaces: the associativity condition might fail. But it is true for some more restricted categories of spaces, such as [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[weak Hausdorff space|weak Hausdorff]] ones.
*The '''[[reduced suspension]]''' Σ''X'' of a pointed space ''X'' is (up to a [[homeomorphism]]) the smash product of ''X'' and the pointed circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
*The reduced suspension is a functor from the category of pointed spaces to itself. This functor is [[left adjoint]] to the functor &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; taking a pointed space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to its [[loop space]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega X&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39407">{{For|the practice of posting to raise the visibility of an Internet forum thread|Bump (Internet)}}

When a message is replied to in [[e-mail]], [[Internet forum]]s, or [[Usenet]], the original can often be included, or &amp;ldquo;quoted,&amp;rdquo; in a variety of different '''posting styles'''.

The main options are '''interleaved posting''' (also called '''inline replying''', in which the different parts of the reply follow the relevant parts of the original post), '''bottom-posting''' (in which the reply follows the quote) or '''top-posting''' (in which the reply precedes the quoted original message). For each of those options, there is also the issue of whether '''trimming''' of the original text is allowed, required, or preferred.

For a long time the traditional style was to post the answer below as much of the quoted original as was necessary to understand the reply (bottom or inline). Many years later, when email became widespread in business communication, it became a widespread practice to reply above the entire original and leave it (supposedly untouched) below the reply.

While each [[virtual community|online community]] differs on which styles are appropriate or acceptable, within some communities the use of the &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; method risks being seen as a breach of [[netiquette]], and can provoke vehement response from community regulars.

==Quoting previous messages==
In an e-mail reply, it is sometimes appropriate to include a full or partial copy of the original message that is being replied to.  As opposed to in-person conversations and Internet [[online chat|chat]]s, email responses may be received long after the original message was sent, so the original sender may have forgotten, misplaced or deleted the original. Many email reading programs ([[mail user agent]]s) encourage this behaviour by automatically including a copy of the original message in the reply editing window.

Quoted text from previous messages is usually distinguished in some way from the new (reply) text. At a minimum, the two parts are given different [[Indentation (typesetting)|indentation]]. In the example below, the first line is the original message, the second line is the reply:

     All these words are terrible. They're hurtful and they make no sense. --Mary
 &lt;br&gt;
 Much like your posting.--Joe.

Alternatively, special delimiter lines may be used:

 Hey Joe, Paris is in France, not England. --Mary
 &lt;br&gt;
 --- original message ---
 You just had a call from England, from Paris I think. --Joe
 --- end of original message ---

For extra clarity, blank lines may also be inserted between the two parts. When using an email medium that supports text markup (such as HTML or RTF), the previous text may be indicated by a distinctive font and/or color:

     &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;The meeting has been postponed to next Friday. --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Has the deadline for the report been moved too? --Joe

===Quoted line prefix===
[[Image:MsOutlook-EmailOptions.png|thumb|right|Alternative e-mail quoting styles supported by Microsoft Outlook]]
{{see also|Usenet quoting}}
A common convention in plain-text email is to prefix each line of the quoted text with a distinctive character or string.  Today (and for many years previously), the [[greater-than sign]] (&amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo;, the [[wikt:canon|canonical]] prefix)&lt;ref name="rfc3676#section-4.5"&gt;R. Gellens (February 2004), '''RFC 3676''' [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3676#section-4.5 ''The Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters'']&lt;/ref&gt; is almost universally used; but other characters such as the [[ASCII]] [[vertical bar]] character (&amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo;) have been used as well, sometimes with one or more spaces inserted before or after the quoted text marker.

There is no standard declaring one quote-prefix to be &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; and others to be &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo;, but some standards depend on conventional quoting. The (unpublished) [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1849.html &amp;ldquo;son-of-1036&amp;rdquo;] draft recommends &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; as the quote-prefix; [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3676.txt RFC 3676] depends on it and considers &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; to be semantically different. That is, &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; has a quote-depth of two, while &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; has a quote-depth of one, quoting a line starting with &amp;ldquo;&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo;. Most e-mail clients treat both alternatives equivalently, however.

The convention of quoting was common in [[Usenet]] newsgroups by 1990, and is supported by many popular  [[User agent|email interfaces]], either by default or as a user-settable option. In [[Microsoft Outlook]], for instance, this option is labeled &amp;ldquo;prefix each line of the original.&amp;rdquo;  Besides inserting markers automatically in quoted lines, some interfaces assume that a line starting with a &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; character or similar is quoted text, and will automatically display it in a distinctive font or color:

 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; How is the report coming? --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe

Sometimes the insertion of a quoted line marker will cause one original line to be folded as two lines in the reply, and the continuation line may not have the proper marker. To avoid ambiguity in such cases, one may consider inserting blank lines after each block of quoted text:

 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt;The board is asking again for the sales data. We really must provide&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; them with some figures. How is the report coming? --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe

Quoted line markers are most commonly used in plain-text messages. In HTML messages, other devices may be used to indicate quoted text, such as [[HTML element|HTML indentation element]]s like &lt;code&gt;[[Blockquote element|blockquote]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dl&lt;/code&gt;.

===Reply level indication===
A message often includes text from two or more messages exchanged in previous rounds of a long discussion. If an additional quotation marker is inserted at every round, without removing any existing markers, the number of markers at the beginning of each line will show the &amp;ldquo;level&amp;rdquo; of the reply, that is, how many rounds have occurred since that line was written. These accumulated markers are usually sufficient to distinguish the parts that came from each message.  Some email interfaces recognize this convention and automatically render each level in a different color. For example:

 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How is the report coming? --Mary
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:magenta"&gt;&gt;
 &gt; Sorry Joe, I need it by 11:00 at the latest. --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 OK, but it will be missing this month's figures. --Joe

If the discussion is between two parties only, then an even number of markers (including zero) identifies text written by the sender, while an odd number of markers identifies text by the recipient. (In the above example even numbers are Joe's text and odd number are Mary's.)

 No problem. 6pm it is then. --Jim
 &lt;br&gt;
 At 10.01am Wednesday, Danny wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Whoa! I need to email a report at 5:30.
 &gt; Could you push it back an hour? --Danny
 &gt;
 &gt; At 9.40am Wednesday, Jim wrote:
 &gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm going to suspend the mail service for approx. thirty
 &gt;&gt; minutes tonight, starting at 5pm. --Jim&lt;/span&gt;

In HTML messages, &lt;code&gt;[[Blockquote element|blockquote]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dl&lt;/code&gt; elements may be nested to achieve the same effect.

===Attribution lines===
Quoted material is often preceded by an ''attribution line'' that identifies its author.  These lines are particularly helpful in discussions between multiple parties. For example:

 Nancy wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Peter wrote:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; When will we have the performance figures?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; The tests will be completed next week. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Peter wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Mary wrote:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter.  We need the sales data and also Nancy's
 performance figures.  Let's meet next Friday after lunch.

This reply quotes two messages, one by Nancy (itself a reply to Peter) and one by Peter (itself a reply to Mary).

Many mail agents will add these attribution lines automatically to the top of the quoted material.  Note that a newly added attribution line should not get the quotation marker, since it is not part of the quoted text; so that the level indicator of the attribution line is always one less than the corresponding text. Doing otherwise may confuse the reader and also e-mail interfaces that choose the text color according to the number of leading markers.

Instead of an attribution line, one may indicate the author by a comment in brackets, at the beginning of the quotation:

 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; [Peter:] When will we have the performance figures?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; [Nancy:] The tests will be completed next week. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; [Mary:] We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; [Peter:] Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter.  We need the sales data and Nancy's
 performance figures.  Let's meet next Friday after lunch.

Another alternative, used in [[Fidonet]] and some [[mail user agent]]s, is to place the initials of the author before the quoting marker. This may be used with or without attribution lines:

 Nancy wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;N&gt; Peter wrote:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;P&gt;&gt; When will we have the performance figures?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;N&gt; The tests will be completed next week. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;

 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;P&gt; Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter.  We need the sales data and also Nancy's
 performance figures.  Let's meet next Friday after lunch.

==Trimming and reformatting==
When replying to long discussions, particularly in [[newsgroup]] discussions, quoted text from the original message is often trimmed so as to leave only the parts that are relevant to the reply — or only a reminder thereof.  This practice is sometimes called &amp;ldquo;trim-posting&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;edited posting&amp;rdquo;, and is recommended by some manuals of posting etiquette.&lt;ref name="rfc1855"&gt;S. Hambridge (October 1995), [[Network Working Group]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 1855 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855 ''Netiquette Guidelines'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes an indicator of deleted text is given, usually in the form of a square bracketed tag as: &amp;ldquo;[snipped],&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;[trimmed],&amp;rdquo; or simply &amp;ldquo;[...]&amp;rdquo;. The text that is retained may be edited to some extent, e.g. by re-folding the lines.  For example, if the original message was

  This is a reminder that the project meeting which was canceled
  last week will be held today in the 3rd floor conference room at
  14:30 sharp.  Everybody must attend. --Mary

the reply may be

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
  &gt; the project meeting [...] will be held today in the 3rd floor
  &gt; conference room
  &lt;/span&gt;
  Mary, be sure to check the mics in that room. --Joe

or even just

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
  &gt; 3rd floor conference room
  &lt;/span&gt;
  Mary, be sure to check the mics in that room. --Joe

Deleted text may also be replaced by a summary in brackets:

  On Thursday, Jim wrote:&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
  &gt; The movie clearly adds a sense of menace to the story
  &gt; which is not present in the original book.
  &gt; [...claim that the darker tone weakens the movie...]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  I disagree.  The darker tone works well, once one understands
  the two are aimed at different audiences.

Automatically included text (such as [[signature block]]s, free e-mail service ads, and corporate disclaimers) are more likely to be deleted, usually without ellipses, than manually written text.  Some posters may delete any parts of the original message that they are not replying to.  Some posters delete only parts dealing with issues that they see as  &amp;ldquo;closed,&amp;rdquo; and leave any parts that, in their opinion, deserve further discussion or will be replied to in a later message.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===How much to trim===
Some style guides recommend that, as a general rule, quoted material in replies should be trimmed or summarized as much as possible, keeping only the parts that are necessary to make the readers understand the replies.&lt;ref name="rfc1855"/&gt;  That of course depends on how much the readers can be assumed to know about the discussion.  For personal e-mail, in particular, the subject line is often sufficient, and no quoting is necessary; unless one is replying to only some points of a long message.&lt;ref name="rfc1855"/&gt;

In particular, when replying to a message that already included quoted text, one should consider whether that quoted material is still relevant.  For example:

&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; [Mary:] Shall we meet this afternoon to discuss the
 &gt;&gt; marketing strategy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; [Peter:] Perhaps, if we can get all the information we need.
 &gt; Do we have the West Coast sales data yet?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 The LA office just sent them in.
 Joe

The quote from Mary's message is relevant to Peter's reply, but not to Joe's reply.  The latter could have been trimmed to

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; [Peter:] Do we have the West Coast sales data yet?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 The LA office just sent them in.
 Joe

On the other hand, in some situations, any trimming or editing of the original message may be inappropriate. For example, if the reply is being copied to a third person who did not see the original message, it may be advisable to quote it in full; otherwise the trimmed message may be misinterpreted by the new recipient, for lack of context.

Also, when replying to a customer or supplier, it may be advisable to quote the original message in its entirety, in case the other party somehow failed to keep a copy of it.

==Placement of replies==

=== Interleaved style ===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Netiquette]] --&gt;

In the interleaved reply style (also called &amp;ldquo;inline reply,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;interlined reply,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;point-by-point rebuttal,&amp;rdquo; or, sometimes, &amp;ldquo;bottom posting&amp;rdquo;), the original message is broken into two or more sections, each followed by a specific reply or comment.  A reply in inline style may also include some [[#Top-posting|top-posted]] or [[#Bottom-posting|bottom-posted]] comments that apply to the whole reply message, rather than to a specific point.  For example:

 I have been following the discussion about the new product line. Here are my thoughts.
 &lt;br&gt;
 Joe wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Will our prices be competitive?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 That may not be a problem for now, we still have a quality edge.
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; We do not have enough trained people on the West Coast. We have many
 &gt; new employees but they do not know our products yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 We can bring them here for a crash training course.
 &lt;br&gt;
 Mary wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; We still do not have a clear marketing plan. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Peter, would you take charge of that? Let me know if you need help.
 &lt;br&gt;
 On the whole, I am quite optimistic.  It looks like we will be shipping
 the basic system before the end of this quarter.
 Nancy

The interleaved reply style can also be combined with top-posting: selected points are quoted and replied to, as above, and then a full copy of the original message is appended.

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Can you present your report an hour later?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Yes I can. The summary will be sent no later than 5pm.
 Jim
 &lt;br&gt;
 At 10.01am Wednesday, Danny wrote:&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; 2.00pm: Present report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Jim, I have a meeting at that time. Can you present your report an hour later?
 &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; 4.30pm: Send out summary of feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Also if you do the above, this may need to happen later too.
 &gt; Danny
 &gt;
 &gt; At 9.40am Wednesday, Jim wrote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; My schedule for today will be:
 &gt;&gt; 10.00am: Gather data for report
 &gt;&gt; 2.00pm: Present report to team
 &gt;&gt; 4.30pm: Send out summary of feedback
 &gt;&gt; Jim&lt;/span&gt;

Interleaving was the predominant reply style in the [[Usenet]] discussion lists, years before the existence of the [[WWW]] and the spread of [[e-mail]] and the [[Internet]] outside the academic community.&lt;ref name="interleave standard"&gt;Archives of Usenet posts at [[Google Groups]] prior to the [[WWW|beginning of the WWW]] (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Interleaving was also common originally in e-mail, because many internet users had been exposed to Usenet newsgroups and other [[Internet forum]]s, where it is still used.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The style became less common for email after the opening of the internet to commercial and non-academic personal use.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} One possible reason is the large number of casual e-mail users that entered the scene at that time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Another possible reason is the inadequate support provided by the reply function of some [[webmail]] readers, which either do not automatically insert a copy of the original message into the reply, or do so without any quoting prefix [[#Quoted line prefix|level indicators]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Finally, most forums, wiki discussion pages, and [[blog]]s (such as [[Slashdot]]) essentially impose the bottom-post format, by displaying all recent messages in chronological order.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Interleaving continues to be used on technical mailing lists where clarity within complex threads is important.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

===Top-posting===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Netiquette]] --&gt;
In top-posting style, the original message is included verbatim, with the reply above it.  It is sometimes referred to by the term '''TOFU''', an acronym for &amp;ldquo;text over, fullquote under.&amp;rdquo;  It has also been colloquially referred to as ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' reply style.  The original message asks a question and the reply answers it, so the order in which these texts appear follows the format of that game show, where the answer (the clue) comes first and the response is a question.

Example:
 No problem.  6pm it is then.
 Jim &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;

Top-posting preserves an apparently unmodified transcript of a branch in the conversation.  Often all replies line up in a single branch of a conversation.  The top of the text shows the latest replies.  This appears to be advantageous for business correspondence, where an e-mail thread can dupe others into believing it is an &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; record.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

By contrast, excessive indentation of interleaved and bottom posting may turn difficult to interpret.  If the participants have different stature such as manager vs. employee or consultant vs. client, one person's cutting apart another person's words without the full context may look impolite or cause misunderstanding.

In the earlier days of [[Usenet]] informal discussions where everyone was an equal encouraged bottom-posting.  Until the mid-1990s, posts in a net.newcomers newsgroup insisted on interleaving replies.  Usenet [[Comp.* hierarchy|''comp.lang'' hierarchy]], especially comp.lang.c and comp.lang.c++ insisted on the same as of the 2010s.  The [[Alt.* hierarchy|''alt'' hierarchy]] tolerated top-posting.  Newer online participants, especially those with limited experience of Usenet, tend to be less sensitive to arguments about posting style.

Top-posting can be problematic on mailing lists with ongoing discussions which eventually require someone to act on the top-posted material. For example, top-posting &amp;ldquo;Those changes look ok to me, go ahead and make them&amp;rdquo; can be very inconvenient for the person who needs to make the changes if he or she has to read through a long email trail to know which changes the top-poster is referring to. Inter-leaving the text directly below the text describing the changes is much more convenient in these cases.

Users of [[handheld device|mobile devices]], like [[smartphone]]s, are encouraged to use top-posting because the devices may only download the beginning of a message for viewing.  The rest of the message is only retrieved when needed, which takes additional download time.  Putting the relevant content at the beginning of the message requires less bandwidth, less time, and less scrolling for the user.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danwarne.com/my-rapidly-growing-email-habit/ My rapidly growing email habit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119091029/http://danwarne.com/my-rapidly-growing-email-habit/ |date=January 19, 2007 }} blog post&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/postfix/2001-07/1670.html  Stopping SirCam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035410/http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/postfix/2001-07/1670.html |date=September 28, 2007 }} — postfix.org mailing list&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2006-June/083465.html Top Posting and Mobiles] — [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|Jabber]] mailing list&lt;/ref&gt;

Top-posting is a natural consequence of the behavior of the &amp;ldquo;reply&amp;rdquo; function in many current e-mail readers, such as [[Microsoft Outlook]], [[Gmail]], and others.  By default, these programs insert into the reply message a copy of the original message (without headers and often without any extra indentation or quotation markers), and position the editing [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] above it.  Moreover, a bug present on most flavours of Microsoft Outlook caused the quotation markers to be lost when replying in plain text to a message that was originally sent in HTML/RTF.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  
For these and possibly other reasons, many users seem to accept top-posting as the &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; reply style.

Partially because of Microsoft's influence, top-posting is very common on [[Electronic mailing list|mailing list]]s and in personal e-mail.&lt;ref name="Intelligently"&gt;{{Cite web

Top-posting has always been the standard format for forwarding a message to a third party, in which case the comments at the top (if any) are a "cover note" for the recipient.

===Bottom-posting===
In the "bottom-posting" style, the reply is appended to a full or partial copy of the original message. The name bottom-posting is sometimes used for inline-style replies, and indeed the two formats are the same when only one point is being replied to.

Bottom-posting, like inline replies, encourages posters to trim the original message as much as possible, so that readers are not forced to scroll past irrelevant text, or text that they have already seen in the original message:

 &gt; [...] Will I have to reboot?
 &lt;/span&gt;
 No problems. 6pm it is then.
 Basically, I will update our WWW server and firewall.
 No, you won't have to reboot.

===Choosing the proper posting style===
The choice between interleaved, top or bottom posting generally depends on the forum and on the nature of the message. Some forums (such as personal e-mail) are quite tolerant, in which case the proper style is dictated by taste and effectiveness.  In any case one should consider whether the reply will be easily read by the intended recipient(s).  Their e-mail interfaces may have different rules for handling quoted line markers and long lines, so a reply that looks readable in one's screen may be jumbled and incorrectly colored on theirs.  Blank lines and judicious trimming of the original text may help avoid ambiguity.

The interleaved reply style can require more work in terms of labeling lines, but possibly less work in establishing the context of each reply line. It also keeps the quotes and their replies close to each other and in logical reading order, and encourages trimming of the quoted material to the bare minimum. This style makes it easier for readers to identify the points of the original message that are being replied to; in particular, whether the reply misunderstood or ignored some point of the original text.   It also gives the sender freedom to arrange the quoted parts in any order, and to provide a single comment to quotations from two or more separate messages, even if these did not include each other.

Top- and bottom-posting are sometimes compared to traditional [[letter (message)|written correspondence]] in that the response is a single continuous text, and the whole original is appended only to clarify which letter is being replied to. [[Customer service]] e-mail practices, in particular, often require that all points be addressed in a clear manner without quoting, while the original e-mail message may be included as an attachment.  Including the whole original message may be necessary also when a new correspondent is included in an ongoing discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mailformat.dan.info/quoting/top-posting.html Quoting: Top Posting] — Dan's Mail Format Site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/ Sensible email] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017180623/http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/ |date=October 17, 2006 }} — Blog post and discussion&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially in business correspondence, an entire message thread may need to be forwarded to a third party for handling or discussion. On the other hand, in environments where the entire discussion is accessible to new readers (such as [[newsgroup]]s or [[online forum]]s), full inclusion of previous messages is inappropriate; if quoting is necessary, the interleaved style is probably best.

If the original message is to be quoted in full, for any reason, bottom-posting is usually the most appropriate format — because it preserves the logical order of the replies and is consistent with the Western reading direction from top to bottom.

It is not uncommon during discussions concerning top-posting vs. bottom-posting to hear quotes from "Netiquette Guidelines (RFC 1855)". While many RFCs are vetted and approved though a committee process, some RFCs, such as RFC 1844, are just "Informational" and in reality, sometimes just personal opinions. (Additional information on "Informational" RFCs can be found in RFC 2026, under "4.2.2  Informational" and "4.2.3  Procedures for Experimental and Informational RFCs".) The nature of RFC 1855 should be considered while reading the following discussion.

According to RFC 1855, a message can begin with an abbreviated summary; i.e. a post can begin with a paraphrasing instead of quoting selectively.  Specifically, it says:

  If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you
  summarize the original at the top of the message, or include just
  enough text of the original to give a context.  This will make
  sure readers understand when they start to read your response.
  Since NetNews, especially, is proliferated by distributing the
  postings from one host to another, it is possible to see a
  response to a message before seeing the original.  Giving context
  helps everyone.  But do not include the entire original!

Interleaved reply combined with top-posting combines the advantages of both styles. However this also results in some portions of the original message being quoted twice, which takes up extra space and may confuse the reader.

In forwarding it is sometimes preferred to include the entire original message (including all headers) as a [[MIME]] attachment, while in top-posted replies these are often trimmed or replaced by an [[#Attribution lines|attribution line]]. An untrimmed quoted message is a weaker form of transcript, as key pieces of [[metadata|meta information]] are destroyed.  (This is why an [[Internet service provider|ISP]]'s [[Postmaster (computing)|Postmaster]] will typically insist on a ''forwarded'' copy of any problematic e-mail, rather than a quote.)  These forwarded messages are displayed in the same way as top-posting in some mail clients.
Top-posting is viewed as seriously destructive to [[Electronic mailing list|mailing-list]] digests, where multiple levels of top-posting are difficult to skip.  The worst case would be top-posting while including an entire digest as the original message.

Some believe that "top-posting" is appropriate for interpersonal e-mail, but inline posting should always be applied to threaded discussions such as newsgroups.

This example is occasionally used in mailing lists to mock and discourage top-posting:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/mailinglists/etiquette.php|title=ARM Linux - Mailing Lists - Etiquette|work=linux.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idallen.com/topposting.html|title=Top Posting and Bottom Posting|work=idallen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://what-is-what.com/what_is/top_posting.html|title=What is Top Posting?|work=what-is-what.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
 Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
 A: Top-posting.
 Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?

Bottom-posting preserves the logical order of the replies and is consistent with the Western reading direction from top to bottom.

The major argument against bottom-posting is that scrolling down through a post to find a reply is inconvenient, especially for short replies to long messages, and many inexperienced computer users may not know that they need to scroll down to find a reply to their query. When sending an untrimmed bottom-posted message, one might indicate inline replies with a notice at the top such as "I have replied below." However, as many modern mail programs are capable of displaying different levels of quotation with different colors (as seen in the [[#Bottom-posting-example|bottom-posting example]] on this page), this is not so much of an issue any more. Another method to indicate that there is more reply text still to come is to always end your text with a signature line. Then a reader who is familiar with your reply style will know to continue to read until your signature line appears. This method is particularly polite and useful when using the inline reply method, since it tells the reader that your response is complete at the point where your signature line appears.

===Quoting support in popular mail clients===

This widespread policy in business communication made bottom and inline posting so unknown among most users that some of the most popular email programs no longer support the traditional posting style. For example, Microsoft Outlook, AOL, and Yahoo! make it difficult or impossible to indicate which part of a message is the quoted original or do not let users insert comments between parts of the original.

Yahoo! does not have the option "Quote the text of the original message" in Mail Classic, but this setting is retained after turning it on in All-New Mail and then switching back to Mail Classic. Inline replying is broken in Microsoft Outlook, which despite choosing the setting to prefix each line of the original with the "greater-than" character (&gt;) produces a blue line that makes answers inserted between quotes of an HTML email look like part of the original. The workarounds are to use the setting "read all standard mail in plain text", or to use the "Edit Message" option on the original email and convert it to plain text before replying (then discard the edited version).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.loftninjas.org/2008/08/14/making-outlook-2007-quote-responsibly/|title=Making Outlook 2007 quote responsibly|work=loftninjas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7632">In [[philosophy]], '''practical reason''' is the use of [[reason]] to decide how to [[philosophy of action|act]]. It contrasts with theoretical reason, often called [[speculative reason]], the use of reason to decide what to follow. For example, agents use practical reason to decide whether to build a [[telescope]], but theoretical reason to decide which of two theories of light and [[optics]] is the best.

==Overview==
Practical reason is understood by most philosophers as determining a plan of action. [[Thomism|Thomistic]] ethics defines the first principle of practical reason as "good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2094.htm#article2 ''Summa Theologiæ'', I-IIª q. 94 a. 2] co.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], practical reason has a law-abiding quality because the [[categorical imperative]] is understood to be binding one to one's duty rather than subjective preferences. [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarians]] tend to see reason as an instrument for the satisfactions of wants and needs.

In classical philosophical terms, it is very important to distinguish three domains of human activity: theoretical reason, which investigates the truth of [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] events as well as [[Logical truth|necessary truths]]; practical reason, which determines whether a prospective course of action is worth pursuing; and productive or technical reason, which attempts to find the best means for a given end. Aristotle viewed philosophical activity as the highest activity of the human being and gave pride of place to metaphysics or wisdom. Since Descartes, practical judgment and reasoning have been treated with less respect because of the demand for greater certainty and an infallible method to justify beliefs.

In [[cognitive]] research, practical reason is the process of ignoring unproductive possibilities in favor of productive possibilities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  It is considered a form of [[cognitive bias]], because it is illogical.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  An example would be calling all hospitals to look for your missing child, but not checking morgues, as finding his corpse would be 'counter-productive.'

== In argumentation ==

Practical reasoning is basically goal-directed reasoning from an agent's goal, and from some action selected as a means to carry out the goal, to the agent's reasoned decision to carry out the action. The agent can be a person or a technical device, such as a robot or  a software device for multi-agent communications. It is a type of reasoning used all the time in everyday life and all kinds of technology where autonomous reasoning is required. [[Argumentation theory|Argumentation theorist]]s have identified two kinds of practical reasoning: ''instrumental practical reasoning'' that does not explicitly take values into account,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=Douglas|authorlink1=Doug Walton|last2=Reed|first2=Chris|last3=Macagno|first3=Fabrizio|title=Argumentation Schemes|date=2008|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=New York|pages=94–95|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''value-based practical reasoning''.&lt;ref name="Atkinson2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkinson|first1=Katie|last2=Bench-Capon|first2=Trevor|last3=McBurney|first3=Peter|title=A Dialogue Game Protocol for Multi-Agent Argument over Proposals for Action|journal=[[Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems]]|date=2005|volume=11|issue=2|pages=153–71|doi=10.1007/s10458-005-1166-x|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following argumentation scheme for instrumental practical reasoning is given in {{harvtxt|Walton|Reed|Macagno|2008}}. The pronoun ''I'' represents an autonomous agent.

===Argumentation scheme for instrumental practical reasoning===
{|
|-
| MAJOR PREMISE:|| I have a goal G.
|-
| MINOR PREMISE:|| Carrying out this action A is a means to realize G.
|-
| CONCLUSION:|| Therefore, I ought (practically speaking) to carry out this action A.
|}

'''Critical questions'''

:CQ1: What other goals do I have that should be considered that might conflict with G?
:CQ2: What alternative actions to my bringing about A that would also bring about G should be considered?
:CQ3: Among bringing about A and these alternative actions, which is arguably the most efficient?
:CQ4: What grounds are there for arguing that it is practically possible for me to bring about A?
:CQ5: What consequences of my bringing about A should also be taken into account?

It can be seen from CQ5  that argumentation from consequences is closely related to the scheme for practical reasoning.
It has often been disputed in philosophy whether practical reasoning is purely instrumental or whether it needs to be based on values. Argument from values is combined with practical reasoning in the type of argumentation called value-based practical reasoning.&lt;ref name="Atkinson2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkinson|first1=Katie|last2=Bench-Capon|first2=Trevor|last3=McBurney|first3=Peter|title=Computational Representation of Practical Argument|journal=[[Synthese]]|date=2006|volume=152|pages=157–206.|doi=10.1007/s11229-005-3488-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macagno|first1=Fabrizio|last2=Walton|first2=Douglas|authorlink2=Doug Walton|title=Persuasive Definitions: Values, Meanings and Implicit Disagreements|journal=Informal Logic|date=2008|volume=28|issue=3|pages=203–28|url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/viewArticle/594}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following argumentation scheme for value-based practical reasoning is given in {{harvtxt|Atkinson|Bench-Capon|McBurney|2005|pp=2–3}}.

===Argumentation scheme for value-based practical reasoning===

:In the current circumstances R
:we should perform action A
:to achieve New Circumstances S
:which will realize some goal G
:which will promote some value V.

Practical reasoning is used in arguments, but also in explanations used to draw conclusions about an agent's goals, motives or intentions, based on reports of what the agent said or did.

Practical reasoning is centrally important in artificial intelligence, and also vitally important in many other fields such as law, medicine and engineering. It has been known as a distinctive type of argumentation as far back as Aristotle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The '''Red Umbrella Project''' is a [[New York City|New York]] based [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] that advocates on behalf of [[sex worker]]s and strives to empower them by giving them a voice.

== History  ==
The Red Umbrella Project was founded in 2010 by writer and activist [[Audacia Ray]]. As a former sex worker, Ray witnessed first-hand the [[discrimination]] against sex workers by police and society.  Ray envisioned an organization where sex workers could come together to share their stories, advocate for change and help one another.  She chose the name The Red Umbrella Project because in 2001 during the 49th Venice Biennale of Art in [[Venice|Venice, Italy]], sex workers demonstrated against inhumane work conditions and [[human rights violation]] by holding up [[International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers|red umbrellas]], making this a symbol of resistance to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexworkeurope.org/campaigns/red-umbrella-campaigns|title=Under the Red Umbrella  {{!}} Sex Work Europe|website=www.sexworkeurope.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Ray started hosting storytelling events for sex workers at the Happy Ending Lounge on New York's Lower East Side. The goals of these workshops and storytelling events were to shine light and empower sex workers, but it soon became apparent that these sex workers shared several common burdens. Many identified as [[Transgender|trans]] or [[queer]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; there was an alarming rate of [[HIV/AIDS]] cases among them,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/trans-sex-workers-are-25-times-more-likely-to-be-hiv-positive-than-the-general-population/|title=Trans Sex Workers Are 25 Times More Likely to Be HIV Positive Than the General Population|newspaper=The Nation|issn=0027-8378|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; they feared carrying condoms due to the criminalization of condoms,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  and most of all they were tossed aside and mistreated by most of society, when all they were doing is trying to make a living and find economic opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/03/sex-workers-legalization-c-v-r.html|title=Is Prostitution Just Another Job?|last=|first=|date=2016-03-21|work=|newspaper=New York Magazine|access-date=2016-12-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/nyregion/08bodies.html|title=Prostitute Disappearances Unnoticed Until Bodies Were Found|last=Fernandez|first=Manny|date=2011-04-07|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy issues ==

=== Sex-worker diversion programs ===
In 2014 New York City created a series of special courts for sex workers arrested on prostitution-related charges. The new courts, known as [[Human trafficking|Human Trafficking]] Intervention Courts (HTIC),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/12/sex-trafficking-victims-not-prostitutes-finally-getting-help-and-a-new-name-in-court.html|title=Sex Trafficking Victims, Not 'Prostitutes,' Finally Getting Help (and a New Name) in Court|last=Ungar-Sargon|first=Batya|date=2015-01-12|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  treated all sex workers as human trafficking victims, and through a variety of [[bullying]] tactics forced defendants to forgo their [[constitutional right]] of a [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] and agree to a [[plea bargain]] of a sex worker diversion program which consisted of a court mandated treatment program, followed by [[adjournment in contemplation of dismissal]] (ACD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/why-are-new-york-courts-lumping-in-sex-workers-with-the-victims-of-human-trafficking-6680891|title=Why Are New York Courts Lumping in Sex Workers With the Victims of Human Trafficking?|last=Merlan|first=Anna|date=2014-10-01|newspaper=Village Voice|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Umbrella Project argued that the city's intentions were good and that the new court does help people who are forced into sex work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the court still treats the sex workers like criminals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/sex-workers-and-the-city-0000550-v22n1|title=Special Prostitution Courts and the Myth of 'Rescuing' Sex Workers - VICE|website=Vice|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-20|date=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes the assumption that all sex workers are victims of human trafficking and that no one does sex work out of free will, for their personal economic gain. There may also be assumed [[Workplace discrimination|discrimination within the workforce]] due to the fact that many sex workers are of [[Person of color|color,]] queer or trans. The counseling and assistance offered through the court mandated treatment program provides them with no way of economic opportunity other than sex work. The Red Umbrella Project wants to see the sex-worker diversion program restructured with an emphasis on [[economic empowerment]] through job training and economic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/why-do-sex-work-diversion-programs-fail/|title=Why Do Sex-Work Diversion Programs Fail?|newspaper=The Nation|issn=0027-8378|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/article/not-everyone-is-happy-with-the-ny-courts-treating-sex-workers-as-trafficking-victims|title=Not Everyone Is Happy with the NY Courts Treating Sex Workers as Trafficking Victims {{!}} VICE News|newspaper=VICE News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/gira-grant-flawed-justice-sex-workers-article-1.1958688?cid=bitly|title=Gira Grant: Flawed justice for sex workers|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS and trans health disparity ===
The Red Umbrella Project along with the Nation Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) and Best Practices Policy Project (BPPP) published a report that [[transgender]] people in the sex trade are twelve times more likely to be living with HIV/AIDS than transgender people who were never involved in the sex trade and twenty-five times more likely to be living with HIV/AIDS than the general population. The Red Umbrella Project points to the fear of [[condom]]s as being used as evidence of prostitution along with [[Racial profiling|profiling of race]] and [[Gender policing|gender]] by police officers where: "Women and trans people having condoms on them is criminalized, whereas a white [[Cisgender|cis male]] having condoms on him is looked at as safe-sex practice." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/13553/Criminalizing_Condoms_Sex_Workers_Get_Policed_but_Remain_Unprotected|title=Criminalizing Condoms: Sex Workers Get Policed but Remain Unprotected|last=Chen|first=Michelle|date=2012-07-20|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Red Umbrella Project and other advocacy groups have been able to push for reform in heavily [[Liberalism|liberal]] cities such as New York City, [[San Francisco]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-nypd-condoms-20140513-story.html|title=NYPD limits use of condoms seized from sex workers as evidence|last=Susman|first=Tine|date=2014-05-12|work=|publisher=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2016-12-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other more [[Conservatism|conservative]] cities such as [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] use condoms as evidence as part of their anti-prostitution campaign Project Rose.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== The Red Umbrella Diaries ==
[[File:Nahshon and Audacia Ray.jpg|thumb|Nahshon Dion Anderson and Audacia Ray founder of Red Umbrella Project.]]
The Red Umbrella Diaries started as a monthly story-telling event at the Happy Ending Lounge on New York's Lower East Side that sought to shed the [[Social stigma|stigma]] around sex work, make it less isolating and show that it can be both [[Exploitation of labour|exploitative]] and empowering" at the same time. The Red Umbrella Diaries was listed by ''[[The Village Voice]]'' as "The Best Way to Meet Sex Workers (for Free)",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/new-documentary-aims-to-complicate-the-narrative-about-sex-workers-7885128|title=New Documentary Aims to 'Complicate the Narrative' About Sex Workers|last=Margolin|first=Madison|date=2015-11-10|newspaper=Village Voice|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/best-of/2010/sports-and-recreation/best-way-to-meet-sex-workers-for-free-6449197|title=Best Way to Meet Sex Workers (for Free): Red Umbrella Diaries {{!}} Best of NYC® 2010: Your Key to the City|website=Village Voice|access-date=2016-12-19 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170510170711/http://www.villagevoice.com/best-of/2010/sports-and-recreation/best-way-to-meet-sex-workers-for-free-6449197
 |archive-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was listed as "Best of New York City's Sports and Recreation" in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

The monthly event eventually led to a documentary produced by [[Audacia Ray]] and multi-[[Emmy Award]]-Winning director David Kornfield and funded by the Red Umbrella Project. The documentary featured seven sex workers telling their stories about trading money for sex on the streets of New York City. The documentary premiered at the [[Portland Film Festival]], in [[Portland, Oregon]] and at the [[IFC Center|IFC theater]] in New York City, and was a [[Doc NYC]] official selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/96311-talking-sex-work-with-the-red-umbrella-diaries-producer-audacia-ray/#.WFmLxnrauUm|title=Talking Sex Work with The Red Umbrella Diaries Producer Audacia Ray {{!}} Filmmaker Magazine|last=Wissot|first=Lauren|newspaper=Filmmaker Magazine|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memoir writing workshop ==
In 2012 the Red Umbrella Project started offering [[memoir]] writing workshops in New York City which was made possible in part by a grant from Poets &amp; Writers. The peer-facilitated workshops were open to all people with experience in the [[sex trade]] and allows sex workers a safe space to build writing skills, share their stories with others, and get feedback from their peers. Attendees of the workshop have the option of having their work published in the Red Umbrella Project's biannual literary journal ''Prose &amp; Lore'', and to share their work on stage as part of their Page to Stage workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redumbrellaproject.org/memoir/|title=Memoir Writing Workshops {{!}} Red Umbrella Project|website=redumbrellaproject.org|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pw.org/content/melissa_petro_and_red_umbrella_writers_dispel_myths_about_sex_work?cmnt_all=1|title=Melissa Petro and Red Umbrella Writers Dispel Myths About Sex Work {{!}} Poets and Writers|website=www.pw.org|access-date=2016-12-20|date=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One participant was [[Nahshon Dion Anderson|Nahshon Anderson]], who for eight weeks in 2013 workshopped the first chapter of their nonfiction manuscript Shooting Range that won a 2014 [[Bronx Recognizes Its Own Award]] (BRIO), given by the [[Bronx Council on the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/50th/stories/nahshon-d-ratcliff|title=Nahshon D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7545">The '''right of reply''' generally means the right to defend oneself against public criticism in the same venue where it was published. In some countries, such as Brazil, it is a legal or even constitutional right. In other countries, it is not a legal right as such, but a right which certain media outlets and publications choose to grant to people who have been severely criticised by them, as a matter of editorial policy.

==By Law==

===Brazil===
The [[Brazilian Constitution]] guarantees the right of reply (''direito de resposta'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituicao.htm] (article 5, V) Retrieved November 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====European Union====
In Europe, there have been proposals for a legally enforceable right of reply that applies to all [[mass media|media]], including [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], and other print media, along with [[radio]], [[television]], and the [[internet]]. In 1974, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe already voted a resolution granting a right of reply to all individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016805048e1 |title=Resolution of the Committee of Ministers on the Right of Reply|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of a 2004 [[Council of Europe]] recommendation defined a right of reply as: ''offering a possibility to react to any information in the media presenting inaccurate facts &amp;hellip; which affect &amp;hellip; personal rights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805db3b6 |title=Draft Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the Right of Reply in the New Media Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediawise.org.uk/display_page.php?id=823 |title=MediaWise submission to DCMS consultation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116213940/http://www.mediawise.org.uk/display_page.php?id=823 |archivedate=2006-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual countries====
In the federal system of [[Germany]], the individual federal states are responsible for education, cultural affairs, and also the press and electronic media. All press laws of the 16 federal states guarantee the right to a counter presentation of factual statements which are deemed to be wrong by the individuals and organisations concerned. This is based on article 11 the national press law of 1874, and is found in all 16 laws as §11 or §10 in slightly modified versions.

[[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] have similar laws on the book. In Austria this is in article 9 of the national media law, in Switzerland in article 28g of the civil code.

In [[France]], the right to a corrective reply goes back to the [[:fr:loi sur la liberté de la presse du 29 juillet 1881|article 13 of the ''Law on the freedom of the press'' of July 29, 1881]] and is renewed and extended to broadcast and digital media via various laws and decrees.

The [[Belgium|Belgian]] law on the right to reply emerged in 1831 as article 13 of the 1831 decree on the press. This was replaced 130 years later by the law on the ''droit de réponse'' or «loi du 23 juin 1961». Originally referring only to the printed press, this law was amended in 1977 by the law of  «4 mars 1977 relative au droit de réponse dans l’audiovisuel» i.e. audiovisual media, published in the ''Moniteur Belge'' of March 15, 1977.&lt;ref name="RDTI_2007-27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obs_Avis-No5"/&gt; Since the federalisation of the Belgian state in 1980, the language communities are responsible for the media, and so the Flemish community has passed in 2005 a decrée dated March 4, 2005, which regulates the right to reply in articles 177 to 199, and the German language community has passed the decree of 27 June 2005, which simply refers to the law of 1961 as amended in 1977.&lt;ref name="RDTI_2007-27"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===United Nations===

The United Nations recognises the "International Right of Correction" through the "Convention on the International Right of Correction", which entered into force on August 24, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/u1circ.htm Convention on the International Right of Correction, 435 U.N.T.S. 191, entered into force August 24, 1962.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
A Florida right of reply law (referring to print media) was overturned by ''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'', [[Case citation|418 U.S. 241]] (1974), while a FCC policy (referring to broadcast media) was affirmed in ''[[Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC]]'',  [[Case citation|395 U.S. 367]]  (1969).

==By editorial policy==

===BBC===
A right of reply can also be part of the editorial policy of a news publication or an academic journal. The [[BBC]]'s Editorial Guidelines state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/page/guidelines-fairness-right-of-reply/ |title=BBC - Editorial Guidelines - Guidelines - Section 6: Fairness, Contributors and Consent - Right of Reply |author= |date= |work= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="font-style:italic;"&gt;When our output makes allegations of wrongdoing, iniquity or incompetence or lays out a strong and damaging critique of an individual or institution the presumption is that those criticised should be given a "right of reply", that is, given a fair opportunity to respond to the allegations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Australasian Journal of Philosophy''===
The ''[[Australasian Journal of Philosophy]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s editorial policy says:&lt;ref&gt;AJP: [http://www.ajp.aap.org.au/editorial-policy.html Editorial Policy] Retrieved August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="font-style:italic;"&gt;[A]uthors of the materials being commented on [in Discussion Notes] may be given a right of reply (subject to the usual refereeing), on the understanding that timely publication of the Note will take priority over the desirability of including both Note and Reply in the same issue of the Journal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Likir Gompa monk with injured sparrow.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monk protecting injured sparrow. [[Likir Monastery]], [[Ladakh]], India]]
In [[Buddhism]], '''sentient beings''' are beings with [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], or in some contexts [[life]] itself.&lt;ref name="Getz"&gt;Getz, Daniel A. (2004). "Sentient beings"; cited in Buswell, Robert E. (2004). ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism''. Volume 2. New York, USA: Macmillan Reference USA. {{ISBN|0-02-865720-9}} (Volume 2): pp.760&lt;/ref&gt; Sentient beings are composed of the five aggregates, or [[skandha]]s: matter, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness. In the ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'', the Buddha is recorded as saying that "just as the word 'chariot' exists on the basis of the aggregation of parts, even so the concept of 'being' exists when the five aggregates are available."&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; While distinctions in usage and potential subdivisions or classes of sentient beings vary from one school, teacher, or thinker to another, it principally refers to beings in contrast with [[buddhahood]]. That is, sentient beings are characteristically ''not'' [[bodhi|enlightened]], and are thus confined to the death, rebirth, and [[dukkha]] (suffering) characteristic of [[saṃsāra]].&lt;ref name="Kimura"&gt;Kimura, Kiyotaka (1991). [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/kiyota1.htm The Self in Medieval Japanese Buddhism: Focusing on Dogen]; cited in ''Philosophy East and West''; Volume 41, Number 3, July 1991. University of Hawaii Press: pp.327–340. Accessed 22 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] simultaneously teaches that sentient beings also contain [[Buddha-nature]]—the intrinsic potential to transcend the conditions of saṃsāra and attain [[bodhi|enlightenment]], thereby obtaining [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |title=The Key Operative Concepts in Korean Buddhist Syncretic Philosophy: Interpenetration (通達) and Essence-Function (體用) in Wŏnhyo, Chinul and Kihwa |accessdate=2008-10-21 |last=Muller |first=Charles A. |year=1995 |work=Bulletin of Toyo Gakuen University |quote=In Buddhism, ''t&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;i'' [體] is regarded as the fundamentally enlightened Buddha-mind that is present in all beings, whereas ''yung'' [用] is the manifestation of that mind in actual practice—whether it be a full manifestation (enlightened Buddha) or limited manifestation (ignorant sentient being). |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828072632/http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=23em|"Those who greatly enlighten illusion are Buddhas; those who are greatly deluded about enlightenment are sentient beings."|—[[Dōgen]]&lt;ref name="Kimura" /&gt;}}

In Mahayana Buddhism, it is to sentient beings that the [[Bodhisattva vow]] of compassion is pledged. Furthermore, and particularly in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Japanese Buddhism]], ''all'' beings (including plant life and even inanimate objects or entities considered "spiritual" or "metaphysical" by conventional Western thought) are or may be considered sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;Keiji, Nishitani (ed.)(1976). ''The Eastern Buddhist''. 9.2: p.72. Kyoto: Eastern Buddhist Society; cited in Dumoulin, Henrich (author); Heisig, James (translator); and Knitter, Paul (translator)(2005).

These are conceived in terms of various spirits, ancestors, demigods, demons, and so on. One of the ways Tibetans recognize a spirit is through the energy that collects in a perceptual moment. A crescendo of energetic "heat" given off by something indicates a spirit. It is something like when we might say that a rock, a tree, or a cloud formation is "striking" or "dramatic" or "compelling." A rock outcropping that has a strange and arresting shape, that perhaps seems strong and menacing, will indicate the existence of some kind of non-human presence. Likewise, a hollow in a grove of trees where a spring flows and the flora are unusually lush and abundant, that has a particularly inviting and nurturing atmosphere, will likewise present itself as the home of a spirit. The unusual behavior of a natural phenomenon or an animal will suggest the same as will the rain that ends a drought or the sudden irruption of an illness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Getz (2004: p.&amp;nbsp;760) provides a generalist Western Buddhist encyclopedic definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Sentient beings'' is a term used to designate the totality of living, conscious beings that constitute the object and audience of Buddhist teaching. Translating various Sanskrit terms (''jantu, bahu jana, jagat, sattva''), ''sentient beings'' conventionally refers to the mass of living things subject to illusion, suffering, and rebirth (Saṃsāra). Less frequently, ''sentient beings'' as a class broadly encompasses all beings possessing consciousness, including Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="Getz"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Classification==
Early scriptures in the [[Pāli Canon]] and the conventions of the Tibetan ''[[Bhavacakra]]'' classify sentient beings into five categories—divinities, humans, animals, tormented spirits, and denizens of hell—although sometimes the classification adds another category of beings called [[asura (Buddhism)|asura]]s between divinities and humans.&lt;ref name="Getz" /&gt;

'''The Septenary''' in [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s teachings refers to the seven principles of [[Human|man]].  In ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]''&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Blavatsky, ''The Key to Theosophy'' pp.&amp;nbsp;90–93&lt;/ref&gt; she presents a synthesis of Eastern ([[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Samkhya]]) and Western ([[Platonism]], 19th century [[Occultism]]) ideas, according to which human nature consists of seven principles. These are:

* ''Atma''  - Spirit or Self - one with The Absolute as Its Radiation.
* ''Buddhi'' - Spiritual Soul - vehicle of pure universal spirit.
* [[Manas (early Buddhism)|''Manas'']] - consisting of ''Higher Manas'', the spiritual, inner, or higher Ego; and ''Lower Manas'', the ordinary [[Mental body|mind]].
* [[Kamarupa (Indian philosophy and Theosophy)|''Kamarupa'']] - the "desire body", seat of animal desires and passions.
* ''[[Prana]]'' - the vital principle.
* [[Subtle body|''Linga Sharira'']] - the double, or [[astral body]].
* ''Sthula Sharira'' - the [[physical body]].

Each of these principles are embodied as such:
* The first body is called ''sthula-sarira'' ([[Sanskrit]], from ''sthula'' meaning coarse, gross, not refined, heavy, bulky, fat in the sense of bigness, conditioned and differentiated matter + ''sarira'' to moulder, waste away). A gross body, impermanent because of its wholly compound character. The physical body is usually considered as the lowest substance-principle. The physical form is the result of the harmonious co-working on the physical plane of forces and faculties streaming through their astral vehicle or linga-sarira, the pattern or model of the physical body.
* The second body is called ''Linga-Sarira'', (Sanskrit, from ''linga'' meaning characteristic mark, model, pattern + ''sarira'', from the verbal root sri to moulder, waste away). A pattern or model that is impermanent; the model-body or [[astral body]], only slightly more ethereal than the physical body. It is the astral model around which the physical body is built, and from which the physical body flows or develops as growth proceeds.
* The third body is [[prana]] (Sanskrit, from ''pra'' before + the verbal root ''an'' to breathe, to live). In Theosophy, the breath of life. This life or prana works on, in, and around us, pulsating unceasingly during the term of physical existence. Prana is "the radiating force or Energy of Atma – as the Universal Life and the One Self – its lower or rather (in its effects) more physical, because manifesting, aspect. Prana or Life permeates the whole being of the objective Universe; and is called a 'principle' only because it is an indispensable factor and the [[deus ex machina]] of the living man."
* The fourth principle is [[kāma]] (Sanskrit, from the verbal root ''kam'' meaning to desire). Desire; the desire principle is the driving, impelling force. Born from the interaction of atman, buddhi, and manas, kama per se is a colourless force, good or bad according to the way the mind and soul use it. It is the seat of the living electrical impulses, desires, and aspirations, considered in their energetic aspect.
* The fifth principle is [[mana]]s (Sanskrit, from the verbal root ''man'' meaning to think). The seat of mentation and egoic consciousness; in humanity Manas is the human person, the reincarnating ego, immortal in essence, enduring in its higher aspects through the entire manvantara. When embodied, manas is dual, gravitating toward buddhi in its higher aspects and in its lower aspects toward kama. The first is intuitive mind, the second the animal, ratiocinative consciousness, the lower mentality and passions of the personality.
* The sixth principle or vehicle is [[Buddhi]] (Sanskrit, from the verbal root ''budh'' to awaken, enlighten, know). The vehicle of pure, universal spirit, hence an inseparable garment or vehicle of atman, which is, in its essence, of the highest plane of akasa or alaya. In man buddhi is the spiritual soul, the faculty of discriminating, the channel through which streams divine inspiration from the atman to the ego, and therefore that faculty which enables us to discern between good and evil: spiritual conscience. The qualities of the buddhic principle when awakened are higher judgment, instant understanding, discrimination, intuition, love that has no bounds, and consequent universal forgiveness.
* The seventh is called [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (Sanskrit). Self; pure consciousness, that cosmic self which is the same in every dweller on this globe and on every one of the planetary or stellar bodies in space. It is the feeling and knowledge of "I am," pure cognition, the abstract idea of self. It does not differ at all throughout the cosmos except in degree of self-recognition. It may also be considered as the First Logos in the human microcosm. During incarnation the lowest aspects of atman take on attributes, because it is linked with buddhi, as the buddhi is linked with manas, as the manas is linked with kama, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/etg-hp.htm Encyclopedic Theosophic Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite using [[Sanskrit]] terminology, many of these concepts are expressed differently from their Indian counterparts.  The [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Self in monistic [[Vedanta]] for example is considered the Universal Self that is the same as, and not just a "ray" of, the Absolute or [[Brahman]].

These seven principles can be grouped into a threefold division of ''Monad'' (transcendent Spirit, consisting of Atma and Buddhi), ''Ego'' (the higher immortal spiritual Personality, made up of the Higher Manas only) and ''Lower Quaternity'' (the mortal personality, the Lower Manas and the remaining principles).  In this, the Lower Manas is a transitional principle, the [[soul]] so to speak, which can choose to join either with the Kama (Desire) principle to form the "Kama-Manas", which becomes an "elementary" or "astral" spirit after death (equivalent perhaps to the ''[[preta]]'' or hungry ghost of [[Buddhism]]), or link with the higher or Buddhi principle to form a higher spiritual consciousness, the "Buddhi-Manas".

Theosophists believe that the most material of the vestures of the soul are interpenetrated by the particles of the more subtle vesture. The Sthula Sarira or gross physical body is mostly space at its atomic level, as all matter is known to be. The interstitial space is inhabited by the subtler particles of the [[Astral body]] or Linga sarira, and so on for the other more energy-like envelopes of the Soul. Because of the interpenetration of each sheath the so-called ''inner person'' is a fluid and unbroken continuity, although varying in density/flexibility and energy. Therefore, it is progressively more susceptible to its true spiritual nature as it is progressively less encumbered by material boundaries; the image of a suspension or [[colloid]] in chemistry is a similar perspective. Matter is postulated to be the physical counterpart of consciousness (ultimately our aspect being pure consciousness); the interpenetration of sheaths allows for consciousness to interpenetrate man's nature and is a Theosophical explanation of sensory experience.

As well as seven subtle bodies, there are also seven [[Plane (cosmology)|Cosmic planes]] of existence.  However, in Blavatsky's teachings, the Planes and Principles don't match up (post-Blavatskian re-interpreters like [[C.W. Leadbeater]] reinterpreted the seven principles so they equate with the seven planes; this interpretation since became standard everywhere but original or orthodox Blavatskyian Theosophy).

While undergoing some changes and modifications in the hands of later esotericists such as C.W. Leadbeater, [[Rudolf Steiner]], and [[Alice Bailey]], Blavatsky's description of the seven [[Subtle body|bodies or principles]] remained a central part of western [[esotericism|esoteric]] and [[New Age]] thinking ever since.

'''Social peer-to-peer processes''' are interactions with a [[peer-to-peer]] dynamic. These peers can be humans or computers. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a term that originated from the popular concept of the P2P distributed computer application architecture which partitions tasks or workloads between peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does Peer-to-Peer Architecture (P2P Architecture) mean?|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/454/peer-to-peer-architecture-p2p-architecture|publisher=Techopedia Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} This application structure was popularized by [[file sharing]] systems like [[Napster]], the first of its kind in the late 1990s.

The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P human dynamic affords a critical look at current [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[centralization|centralized]] social structures. Peer-to-peer is also a political and social program for those who believe that in many cases, peer-to-peer modes are a preferable option.

== Definition ==
P2P is a specific form of relational dynamic, based on the assumed [[equipotent|equipotency]] of its participants, organized through the free cooperation of equals in view of the performance of a common task, for the creation of a common good, with forms of decision making and autonomy that are widely distributed throughout the network.

There are several fundamental aspects of social P2P processes:
* [[peer production]] - the collaborative production of use value is open to participation and use to the widest possible number (as defined by [[Yochai Benkler]], in his essay Coase's Penguin);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf | title = Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm | first = Yochai | last = Benkler | publisher = The Yale Law Journal | format = PDF | date =  | accessdate = 2010-04-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101010152105/http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf | archivedate = 2010-10-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* peer governance - production or project is governed by the community of producers themselves, not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy;
* peer property - the use-value of property is freely accessible on a universal basis; peer services and products are distributed through new modes of property, which are not exclusive, though recognize individual authorship (i.e. the [[GNU General Public License]] or the [[Creative Commons]] licenses).

Peer production does not produce commodities for exchange value, and does not use the [[price mechanism]] or [[corporate]] [[hierarchy]] to determine the allocation of resources. It must therefore be distinguished from both the [[capitalist]] [[Market (economics)|market]] (though it can be linked and embedded in the broader market) and from production through state and corporate planning; as a mode of [[governance]] it differs from traditional [[linear]] hierarchies; and as a mode of property it differs from both traditional private property and state-based collective [[public property]]; it is rather the common property of its producers and users and the whole of humankind. Unlike [[private property]], peer property is inclusive rather than exclusive — its nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible.

== Characteristics ==
P2P processes are not structureless, but are characterized by dynamic and changing structures which adapt themselves to phase changes. Its rules are not derived from an external authority, as in hierarchical systems, but are generated from within. It does not deny ‘authority’, but only fixed forced hierarchy, and therefore accepts authority based on expertise, initiation of the project, etc. P2P may be the first true [[meritocracy]]{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. P2P eliminates most, if not all, barriers to entry. The threshold for participation is kept as low as possible. Equipotency means that there is no prior formal filtering for participation, but rather that it is the immediate practice of cooperation which determines the expertise and level of participation. Communication is not top-down and based on strictly defined reporting rules, but feedback is systemic, integrated in the protocol of the cooperative system. Techniques of 'participation capture' and other social accounting make automatic cooperation the default scheme of the project. Personal identity becomes partly generated by the contribution to the common project. P2P characterists have been studied by [[Howard Rheingold]] ''et al.'''s Cooperation Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rheingold.com/cooperation/CooperationProject_3_30_05.pdf |title=The Cooperation Project: Objectives, Accomplishments, Proposals |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P2P is a network, not a linear or 'pyramidal' hierarchy (though it may have elements of it); it is 'distributed', though it may have elements of [[centralization]] and 'decentralisation'; intelligence is not located at any center, but everywhere within the system. Assumed equipotency means that P2P systems start from the premise that ‘it doesn’t know where the needed resource will be located’, it assumes that ‘everybody’ can cooperate, and does not use formal rules in advance to determine its participating members. Participants are expected to self-select the module that corresponds best to their expertise. Equipotency, i.e. the capacity to cooperate, is verified in the process of cooperation itself. [[Data validation|Validation]] of knowledge, acceptance of processes, are determined by the collective through the use of digital rules which are embedded in the project's basic protocol. Cooperation must be free, not forced, and not based on neutrality (i.e. the buying of cooperation in a monetary system). It exists to produce something. It enables the widest possible participation. These are a number of characteristics that we can use to describe P2P systems ‘in general’, and in particular as it emerges in the human lifeworld. Whereas participants in hierarchical systems are subject to the panoptism of the select few who control the vast majority, in P2P systems, participants have access to holoptism, the ability for any participant to see the whole.

== Infrastructure ==
The first requirement to facilitate the emergence of peer-to-peer processes is the existence of a technological infrastructure that enables distributed access to fixed capital. Individual computers that enable a universal machine capable of executing any logical task are a form of distributed fixed capital, available at low cost to many producers. The internet, as a point to point network, was specifically designed for participation by the edges (computer users) without the use of obligatory hubs. Although it is not fully in the hands of its participants, the internet is controlled through distributed governance, and outside the complete hegemony of particular private or state actors. The Internet's hierarchical elements, such as the stacked [[IP protocol]]s and [[Domain Name System]], do not deter participation. Viral communicators, or meshworks, are a logical extension of the internet. With this methodology, devices create their own networks through the use of excess capacity, bypassing the need for a pre-existing infrastructure. [[Wireless community network]]s, Open Spectrum advocacy, file-serving television, and alternative meshwork-based telecommunication infrastructures are exemplary of this trend.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=499
  |title=The Political Economy of Peer Production
  |date=2005-01-12
  |author=
  |publisher=CTheory
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second requirement is alternative information and communication systems which allow for [[autonomous]] communication between cooperating agents. The web (in particular the Writeable Web and the [[Web 2.0]] that is in the process of being established) allows for the universal autonomous production, dissemination, and 'consumption' of written material while the associated [[podcasting]] and [[webcasting]] developments create an 'alternative information and communication infrastructure' for audio and audiovisual creation. The existence of such an infrastructure enables autonomous content production that may be distributed without the intermediary of the classic publishing and broadcasting media (though new forms of mediation may arise).&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The third requirement is the existence of a 'software' infrastructure for autonomous global cooperation. A growing number of collaborative tools, such as blogs and wikis, embedded in [[social networking]] software facilitate the creation of trust and [[social capital]], making it possible to create global groups that can create [[use-value]] without the intermediary of manufacturing or distribution by for-profit [[Business|enterprises]].&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The fourth requirement is a legal infrastructure that enables the creation of use-value and protects it from private [[appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]. The [[General Public License]] (which prohibits the appropriation of software code), the related [[Open Source Initiative]], and certain versions of the [[Creative Commons]] license fulfill this role. They enable the protection of common use-value and use viral characteristics to spread. [[GPL]] and related material can only be used in projects that in turn put their adapted source code in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The fifth requirement is cultural. The diffusion of mass intellectuality, (i.e. the distribution of human intelligence) and associated changes in ways of feeling and being ([[ontology]]), ways of knowing ([[epistemology]]) and value constellations ([[axiology]]) have been instrumental in creating the type of cooperative individualism needed to sustain an [[ethos]] which can enable P2P projects.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

== In the economy ==

=== Capitalism ===
There are two important aspects to the emergence of P2P in the economic sphere. On the one hand, as format for peer production processes, it is emerging as a 'third mode of production' based on the cooperation of autonomous agents. Indeed, if the first mode of production was [[laissez-faire]] based [[capitalism]], and the second mode was the model of a [[Central planning|centrally-planned]] economy, then the third mode is defined neither by the motor of profit, nor by central planning: to allocate resources and make decisions, it does not use market and pricing mechanisms, or managerial commands, but instead uses [[social relations]]. Peer production is a significant part of the [[mainstream]] economy, even if it is not much advertised as such in mainstream economic literature.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

Despite significant differences, P2P and the capitalist market are highly interconnected. P2P is dependent on the market and the market is dependent on P2P. Peer production produces [[use-value]] through mostly [[Intellectual capital|immaterial]] production, without directly providing an income for its producers. Participants cannot live from peer production, though they derive meaning and value from it.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The market and capitalism are also dependent on P2P. Capitalism has become a system relying on distributed networks, in particular on the P2P infrastructure in computing and communication. Productivity is highly reliant on cooperative [[teamwork]], most often organized in ways that are derivative of peer production's governance. The support given by major IT companies to [[open-source software development|open-source development]] is a testimony to the use derived from even the new common property regimes. The general [[business model]] seems to be that businesses use the P2P [[infrastructure]], and create a surplus value through services, which can be packaged for [[exchange value]]. For-profit enterprises mostly use partial implementations of P2P. [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] built itself around user reviews,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} [[eBay]] lives on a platform of worldwide distributed auctions, and [[Google]] is constituted by [[user-generated]] content. Value creation today is no longer confined to the enterprise, but beholden to the mass intellectuality of [[knowledge worker]]s, who through their lifelong learning/experiencing and systemic connectivity, constantly innovate within and without the enterprise.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; Yet more recently, in the last decade, peer-to-peer exchanges have become even more prevalent in the so-called "[[sharing economy]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The rise of the sharing economy|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21573104-internet-everything-hire-rise-sharing-economy|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also termed an "access economy" or a "peer exchange economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Popularity of Peer-to-Peer Exchanges in the Last Decade|url=http://www.gearpeers.com/blog/the-popularity-of-peer-to-peer-exchanges-in-the-last-decade/|publisher=Gear Peers|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, businesses such as [[Uber]], [[Lyft]], and [[Airbnb]] are all based on peer-to-peer physical exchanges. This sharing economy is projected by some analysts to encompass $335 billion by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Car Sharing Economy|url=http://www.drivemycar.com.au/Long-term-rental-in-the-car-sharing-economy|publisher=DriveMyCar|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhuo|first1=TX|title=Airbnb and Uber Are Just the Beginning. What's Next for the Sharing Economy.|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244192|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer-to-peer systems contribute to more specific forms of distributed capitalism. The massive use of [[open source software]] in business, enthusiastically supported by [[venture capital]] and large IT companies such as [[IBM]], is creating a distributed software platform that will drastically undercut the [[monopolistic]] rents enjoyed by companies such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], while [[Skype]] and [[VoIP]] will drastically redistribute the [[Telecommunications service provider|telecom]] infrastructure. In addition, it also points to a new business model that is 'beyond' products, focusing instead on services associated with the nominally free FS/OS software model. Industries are gradually transforming themselves to incorporate user-generated innovation, and a new intermediation may occur around user-generated media. Many knowledge workers are choosing non-corporate paths and becoming mini-entrepreneurs, relying on an increasingly sophisticated participatory infrastructure, a kind of digital corporate commons.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

=== Market economy ===
Social P2P systems are different from [[market economy]]:&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; neither market pricing nor managerial command are required for P2P processes to make decisions regarding the allocation of [[resources]]. There are further differences:

* Market economy is similar to insect-like [[swarm intelligence]]. There are autonomous agents in a distributed environment, but each individual only sees his own immediate benefit.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;
* Markets are based on 'neutral' cooperation, and not on [[synergistic]] cooperation: no [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] is created.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;
* Markets operate on the production and exchange of value to generate [[Profit (economics)|profit]], not [[production for use]].
* Whereas P2P aims at full participation, markets only fulfill the needs of those with [[purchasing power]].

Markets do not function well for common needs that do not involve direct payment&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; ([[national security|national defense]], general policing, [[education]] and [[public health]]). In addition, they fail to take into account [[negative externalities]]&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; (the environment, social costs, future generations).

=== P2P economic system ===
In ''The Political Economy of Peer Production'' Bauwens regards P2P phenomena as an emerging alternative to capitalist society. P2P economy may be seen as extending or already existing outside the sphere of free/open source software production and other non-rival immaterial goods. Peer production effectively enables the free cooperation of producers, who have access to their own means of [[Production (economics)|production]], and the resulting use-value of the projects supersedes for-profit alternatives.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

Historically, though forces of higher [[productivity]] may be temporarily embedded in the old productive system, they ultimately lead to deep upheavals and reconstitutions of the [[political economy]]. The emergence of capitalist modes within the [[feudal system]] is a case in point. This is particularly significant because leading sectors of the for-profit economy are deliberately slowing down productive growth (through patents and [[Monopoly|monopolization]]) and trying to outlaw P2P production and sharing practices.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

== In politics ==

=== Governance ===
[[Government]]s of countries are composed of a specialized and privileged body of individuals, who [[monopolize]] political decision-making. Their function is to enforce existing laws, [[legislate]] new ones, and arbitrate conflicts via their monopoly on violence. Legislation can be open to the general [[citizenry]] through [[open source governance]], allowing policy development to benefit from the collected wisdom of the people as a whole.

[[Michel Bauwens]] has stated, that society is not a peer group with an [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] [[consensus]], but rather a [[decentralized]] structure of competing groups and [[representative democracy]] cannot be replaced entirely by peer governance.&lt;ref name="Re-public"&gt;{{cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer projects which evolve beyond a certain scale and start facing issues of decisions about scarce [[resources]], will probably adapt some representational mechanisms. Representative and [[bureaucratic]] [[decision-making]] can and will in some places be replaced by global governance networks which may be self-governed to a large extent, but in any case, it will and should incorporate more and more [[Multistakeholder Model]]s (i.e. [[collaborative e-democracy]]), which strives to include all groups that could be affected. This group-based partnership model is different, but related in spirit, to the individual-based peer governance, because they share an [[ethos]] of participation.&lt;ref name="Re-public"/&gt;

=== Open source movements ===
Many new movements are taking on P2P organizational formats, such as the [[alter-globalization]] movement and the [["Occupy" protests|"Occupy"]] movement (i.e. [[Occupy Wall Street]]). The movements see itself as a network of networks that combines players from a wide variety of fields and opinion, who, despite the fact that they do not see eye to eye in all things, manage to unite around a common [[Computing platform|platform]] of action around certain key events.

They are able to mobilize vast numbers of people from every [[continent]], without having at their disposal any of the traditional [[news media]], such as television, radio or newspapers. Rather, they rely almost exclusively on the P2P technologies described above. Thus, Internet media are used for communication and learning on a continuous basis, prior to the mobilizations, and also during the mobilizations.

Independent Internet media platforms such as [[Indymedia]], as well as the skillful use of mobile phones, are used for real-time response management, undertaken by small groups that use buddy-list technologies, and sometimes open source programs that have been explicitly designed for political activism such as TextMob.

Many reports have appeared, including those described in Howard Rheingold's [[Smart Mob]]s, about the political significance of [[SMS]] in organizing successful protests and ‘democratic revolutions’. The network model allows for a more fluid organization that does not fix any group in a permanent adversarial position. Various temporary coalitions are created on an [[ad hoc]] basis depending on the issues.

'''''Son et lumière''''' {{IPA-fr|sɔ̃n e lymjɛʁ}} (French, lit. "sound and light"), or a '''sound and light show''', is a form of nighttime entertainment that is usually presented in an outdoor venue of historic significance.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=son et lumière |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/554172/son-et-lumiere |accessdate=30 March 2010 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Special [[lighting]] effects are projected onto the façade of a building or [[ruin]] and synchronized with recorded or live [[narration]] and music to dramatize the history of the place.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;  The invention of the concept is credited to Paul Robert-Houdin, who was the [[curator]] of the [[Château de Chambord]] in France, which hosted the world's first ''son et lumière'' in 1952.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;  Another was established in the early 1960s at the site of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in Egypt.

This nighttime medium naturally lends itself to ecclesiastical buildings, stately homes and ruins,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010|reason=The unattributed claim that the nighttime "naturally lends itself..." gives the impression of being an original claim (see "Wikipedia:No original research") in the absence of a reference.}} and has rapidly become very popular in France where about 50 annual productions take place,&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; principally in the [[Loire Valley]], at the [[Palace of Versailles]] and at [[Les Invalides]] in Paris.

The format usually involves no active participation by actors but a recorded narrative of the history of the building concerned by one or a cast of voices. To this is added music or [[sound effect]]s as appropriate, all of which is synchronised to lighting and/or projection effects which provide the visual dimension. [[Pyrotechnic]] effects are occasionally included for added spectacle.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;

A relatively recent variation is that, rather than the music and narration coming through a concert-like sound system, they may use [[Headset (audio)|headsets]], such as in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania's "Lights of Liberty". This allows an audience to move through a historic district as the show proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitphilly.com/history/philadelphia/lights-of-liberty/ Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102130036/http://www.visitphilly.com/history/philadelphia/lights-of-liberty/ |date=2011-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performances around the world==

In France, ''son et lumière'' shows are performed in and around France's historical [[château]]x. 

In neighboring [[Luxembourg]], a ''son et lumière'' event took place in 2007 at the Chateau de Septfontaines. 

In other countries, ''son et lumière'' has been mounted at the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] in Rome and at the [[Parthenon]] in Athens. 

In the United States, the first such presentation took place at [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]] in 1962. Another presentation took place at George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] in May 1976 as France's bicentennial gift to the United States. The opening performance was attended by French President [[Giscard d'Estaing]] and American President [[Gerald Ford]].

Further afield, the first African production was at the [[Pyramids of Giza]] at [[Cairo]], Egypt, in 1961, while the first in Asia was the [[Red Fort]] in [[Delhi]], India in 1965 by the [[India Tourism Development Corporation]]. 

[[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England featured a ''son et lumière'' in 1965 and more recently in 2005, along with [[Rochester Cathedral]] and [[Rochester Castle|Castle]] as part of the European "Cathedrales en Lumière" project.

In Britain, where the majority of such productions have been staged at churches, [[cathedral]]s and [[abbey]]s, indoor presentations are frequently preferred, particularly as architectural gems might otherwise not be shown to best advantage.  The first British production was at [[Greenwich Palace]] in south London in 1957. In England in particular, where ''son et lumière'' is as well received as it is in France, many of the nations's principal historic houses and church buildings have enjoyed such a production.  Of particular interest have been the ones at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] (produced as part of the European "Cathedrales en Lumière" events), [[Rochester Castle]], [[St Augustine's Abbey]], [[St. George's Hall, Liverpool]], [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Hampton Court Palace]], and at [[Chartwell]], the country home of [[Winston Churchill]]. Part of the [[London 2012 Olympic bid]] involved the use of ''son et lumière'' inspired light projections of [[sportsperson|athletes]] upon various London buildings. 

In [[India]], popular shows are at [[Red Fort]], [[Amer Fort]], [[Akbari Quila]], [[Ajmer]], [[Jantar Mantar, Jaipur]], [[Purana Qila, Delhi]], and [[Golconda Fort]]. In [[Peru]], a ''son et lumière'' show opened in [[Park of the Reserve]], Lima in 2007, called "Circuito Mágico del Agua" (''magic water circuit'') which has a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness record]] as the world's largest water source exposed in a public park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amarengo.org/articulos/circuito Circuito Mágico del Agua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212205457/http://amarengo.org/articulos/circuito |date=2010-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Canada, the [[National Capital Commission]] has sponsored a sound and light show on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]] every year since 1984, from early July to mid-September.

In Australia, ''Blood Under the Southern Cross'', shown at [[Sovereign Hill]] in [[Ballarat]] since 1992, depicts the events of the 1854 [[Eureka Rebellion]].

In Israel, a son et lumière production is presented both at the [[Tower of David]] in the Citadel of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]], and at the desert butte of [[Masada]]. 

Composers who have produced son et lumière shows include [[Jacqueline Nova]] and [[Halim El-Dabh]]. French electronic music composer [[Jean Michel Jarre]] has incorporated son et lumière productions into his live concerts, which often take place outdoors at historical sites, sometimes with more than one million spectators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6819">'''Subjunctive possibility''' (also called '''[[Aletheia|alethic]] possibility''') is the form of modality most frequently studied in [[modal logic]]. Subjunctive possibilities are the sorts of possibilities we consider when we conceive of counterfactual situations; subjunctive modalities are modalities that bear on whether a statement ''might have been'' or ''could be'' true—such as ''might'', ''could'', ''must'', ''possibly'', ''necessarily'', ''contingently'', ''essentially'', ''accidentally'', and so on. Subjunctive possibilities include [[logical possibility]], metaphysical possibility, nomological possibility, and temporal possibility.

== Subjunctive possibility and other modalities ==

Subjunctive possibility is contrasted with (among other things) [[epistemic possibility]] (which deals with how the world ''may'' be, ''for all we know'') and [[Deontological ethics|deontic possibility]] (which deals with how the world ''ought'' to be). {{further|Counterfactual conditional}}

=== Epistemic possibility ===

The contrast with epistemic possibility is especially important to draw, since in ordinary language the same phrases ("it's possible," "it can't be", "it must be") are often used to express either sort of possibility. But they are not the same. We do not ''know'' whether [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is true or not (no-one has come up with a proof yet); so it is (epistemically) ''possible that'' it is true and it is (epistemically) ''possible that'' it is false. But if it ''is'', in fact, provably true (as it may be, for all we know), then it would have to be (subjunctively) ''necessarily'' true; what being provable ''means'' is that it would not be (logically) ''possible for'' it to be false. Similarly, it might not be at all (epistemically) ''possible that'' it is raining outside—we might ''know'' beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is not—but that would hardly mean that it is (subjunctively) ''impossible for'' it to rain outside. This point is also made by Norman Swartz and Raymond Bradley.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Swartz and Raymond Bradley, ''Possible Worlds — An Introduction to logic and its philosophy'', 1979, Hackett Publishing company, inc., {{ISBN|0-631-16130-9}}. Pp. 329-330&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deontic possibility ===

There is some overlap in language between subjunctive possibilities and deontic possibilities: for example, we sometimes use the statement "You can/cannot do that" to express (i) what it is or is not subjunctively possible for you to do, and we sometimes use it to express (ii) what it would or would not be right for you to do. The two are less likely to be confused in ordinary language than subjunctive and epistemic possibility as there are some important differences in the logic of subjunctive modalities and deontic modalities. In particular, subjunctive necessity entails truth: if people logically must such and such, then you can infer that they actually do it. But in this non-ideal world, a deontic ‘must’ does not carry the moral certitude that people morally must do such and such.

== Types of subjunctive possibility ==

There are several different types of subjunctive modality, which can be classified as broader or more narrow than one another depending on how restrictive the rules for what counts as "possible" are. Some of the most commonly discussed are:

* '''[[Logical possibility]]''' is usually considered the broadest sort of possibility; a proposition is said to be logically possible if there is no logical contradiction involved in its being true. "[[Dick Cheney]] is a bachelor" is logically possible, though in fact false; most philosophers have thought that statements like "If I flap my arms very hard, I will fly" are ''logically'' possible, although they are ''nomologically'' impossible. "[[Dick Cheney]] is a married bachelor," on the other hand, is ''logically impossible''; anyone who is a bachelor is ''therefore'' not married, so this proposition is logically self-contradictory (though the sentence isn't, because it is logically possible for  "bachelor" to mean "married man").
* '''Metaphysical possibility''' is either equivalent to logical possibility or narrower than it (what a philosopher thinks the relationship between the two is depends, in part, on the philosopher's view of [[logic]]). Some philosophers have held that ''discovered identities'' such as [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]]'s "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" are metaphysically necessary but not [[logical truth|logically necessary]] (they would claim that there is no formal contradiction involved in "Water is ''not'' H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" even though it turns out to be metaphysically impossible). In reality though, water also contains H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions.
* '''Nomological possibility''' is ''possibility under the actual laws of nature''. Most philosophers since [[David Hume]] have held that the laws of nature are ''metaphysically contingent''—that there could have been different natural laws than the ones that actually obtain. If so, then it would not be ''logically'' or ''metaphysically'' impossible, for example, for you to travel to [[Alpha Centauri]] in one day; it would just have to be the case that you could travel faster than the [[speed of light]]. But of course there is an important sense in which this is ''not'' possible; ''given'' that the laws of nature are what they are, there is no way that you could do it. (Some philosophers, such as [[Sydney Shoemaker]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, have argued that the laws of nature are in fact ''necessary'', not contingent; if so, then nomological possibility is equivalent to metaphysical possibility.)
* '''Temporal possibility''' is ''possibility given the actual history of the world''. [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] ''could have'' chosen to take his degree in Accounting rather than Philosophy; but there is an important sense in which he ''cannot now''. The "could have" expresses the fact that there is no logical, metaphysical, or even nomological impossibility involved in Lewis's having a degree in Economics instead of Philosophy; the "cannot now" expresses the fact that that possibility is no longer open to becoming actual, given that the past is as it actually is.

Similarly David Lewis could have taken a degree in Economics but not in, say, Aviation (because it was not taught at Harvard) or Cognitive Neuroscience (because the so-called 'conceptual space' for such a major did not exist). There is some debate whether this final type of possibility in fact constitutes a type of possibility distinct from Temporal, and is sometimes called Historical Possibility by thinkers like [[Ian Hacking]].

'''Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment''' ('''SELEX'''), also referred to as ''[[Deoxyribozyme#in vitro selection|in vitro selection]]'' or ''[[Deoxyribozyme#in vitro evolution|in vitro evolution]]'', is a [[combinatorial chemistry]] technique in [[molecular biology]] for producing [[oligonucleotide]]s of either single-stranded [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that specifically bind to a target [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] or ligands, which are commonly referred to as [[aptamer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hak-Hagir A | title = [The Hak-Hagir skin conduit] | journal = Zeitschrift Fur Urologie Und Nephrologie | volume = 71 | issue = 9 | pages = 639–42 | date = September 1978 | pmc = 362762 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.9.7.2944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuerk C, Gold L | title = Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment: RNA ligands to bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase | journal = Science | volume = 249 | issue = 4968 | pages = 505–10 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2200121 | doi = 10.1126/science.2200121 | bibcode = 1990Sci...249..505T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellington AD, Szostak JW | title = In vitro selection of RNA molecules that bind specific ligands | journal = Nature | volume = 346 | issue = 6287 | pages = 818–22 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 1697402 | doi = 10.1038/346818a0 | bibcode = 1990Natur.346..818E }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although SELEX has emerged as the most commonly used name for the procedure, some researchers have referred to it as '''SAAB''' (selected and amplified binding site) and '''CASTing''' (cyclic amplification and selection of targets)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackwell TK, Weintraub H | title = Differences and similarities in DNA-binding preferences of MyoD and E2A protein complexes revealed by binding site selection | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4984 | pages = 1104–10 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2174572 | doi = 10.1126/science.2174572 | bibcode = 1990Sci...250.1104B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright WE, Binder M, Funk W | title = Cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) for the myogenin consensus binding site | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 4104–10 | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1649388 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.11.8.4104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SELEX was first introduced in 1990. In 2015 a special issue was published in the [[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] in the honor of quarter century of the SELEX discovery.

The process begins with the synthesis of a very large oligonucleotide library consisting of randomly generated sequences of fixed length flanked by constant [[5' end|5']] and [[3' end|3']] ends that serve as [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For a randomly generated region of length ''n'', the number of possible sequences in the library is 4&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (''n'' positions with four possibilities (A,T,C,G) at each position). The sequences in the library are exposed to the target ligand - which may be a [[protein]] or a [[small organic compound]] - and those that do not bind the target are removed, usually by [[affinity chromatography]] or target capture on paramagnetic beads.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoltenburg R, Schubert T, Strehlitz B | title = In vitro Selection and Interaction Studies of a DNA Aptamer Targeting Protein A | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = e0134403 | date = 2015-07-29 | pmid = 26221730 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0134403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bound sequences are eluted and amplified by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; to prepare for subsequent rounds of selection in which the stringency of the elution conditions can be increased to identify the tightest-binding sequences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A caution to consider in this method is that the selection of extremely high, sub-[[Nano-|nano]]molar binding affinity entities may not in fact improve specificity for the target molecule.&lt;ref name="Carothers"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carothers JM, Oestreich SC, Szostak JW | title = Aptamers selected for higher-affinity binding are not more specific for the target ligand | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 128 | issue = 24 | pages = 7929–37 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16771507 | pmc = 4287982 | doi = 10.1021/ja060952q }}&lt;/ref&gt; Off-target binding to related molecules could have significant clinical effects.

SELEX has been used to develop a number of aptamers that bind targets interesting for both clinical and research purposes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu YX, Kwon YJ | title = Aptamers: The "evolution" of SELEX | journal = Methods | volume = 106 | pages = 21–8 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27109056 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.04.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also towards these ends, a number of nucleotides with chemically modified sugars and bases have been incorporated into SELEX reactions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keefe AD, Cload ST | title = SELEX with modified nucleotides | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 448–56 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18644461 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.06.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These modified nucleotides allow for the selection of aptamers with novel binding properties and potentially improved stability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Procedure ==

=== Generating single stranded oligonucleotide library ===
The first step of SELEX involves the synthesis of fully or partially randomized oligonucleotide sequences of some length flanked by defined regions which allow PCR amplification of those randomized regions and, in the case of RNA SELEX, in vitro transcription of the randomized sequence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huizenga2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huizenga DE, Szostak JW | title = A DNA aptamer that binds adenosine and ATP | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 656–65 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7819261 | doi = 10.1021/bi00002a033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ellington and Szostak demonstrated that chemical synthesis is capable of generating ~10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; unique sequences for oligonucleotide libraries in their 1990 paper on in vitro selection,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; they found that amplification of these synthesized oligonucleotides led to significant loss of pool diversity due to PCR bias and defects in synthesized fragments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The oligonucleotide pool is amplified and a sufficient amount of the initial library is added to the reaction so that there are numerous copies of each individual sequence to minimize the loss of potential binding sequences due to stochastic events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Before the library is introduced to target for incubation and selective retention, the sequence library must be converted to single stranded oligonucleotides to achieve structural conformations with target binding properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Target incubation ===
Immediately prior to target introduction, the single stranded oligonucleotide library is often heated and cooled slowly to renature oligonucleotides into thermodynamically stable secondary and tertiary structures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Once prepared, the randomized library is incubated with immobilized target to allow oligonucleotide-target binding. There are several considerations for this target incubation step, including the target immobilization method and strategies for subsequent unbound oligonucleotide separation, incubation time and temperature, incubation buffer conditions, and target versus oligonucleotide concentrations. Examples of target immobilization methods include [[affinity chromatography]] columns,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; nitrocellulose [[Filter binding assay|binding assay filters,]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and [[Dynabeads|paramagnetic beads.]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Recently, SELEX reactions have been developed where the target is whole cells, which are expanded near complete [[Confluency|confluence]] and incubated with the oligonucleotide library on culture plates.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwagawa T, Ohuchi SP, Watanabe S, Nakamura Y | title = Selection of RNA aptamers against mouse embryonic stem cells | journal = Biochimie | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 250–7 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22085640 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2011.10.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incubation buffer conditions are altered based on the intended target and desired function of the selected aptamer. For example, in the case of negatively charged small molecules and proteins, high salt buffers are used for [[Electric-field screening|charge screening]] to allow nucleotides to approach the target and increase the chance of a specific binding event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Alternatively, if the desired aptamer function is in vivo protein or whole cell binding for potential therapeutic or diagnostic application, incubation buffer conditions similar to in vivo plasma salt concentrations and homeostatic temperatures are more likely to generate aptamers that can bind in vivo. Another consideration in incubation buffer conditions is non-specific competitors. If there is a high likelihood of non-specific oligonucleotide retention in the reaction conditions, non specific competitors, which are small molecules or polymers other than the SELEX library that have similar physical properties to the library oligonucleotides, can be used to occupy these non-specific binding sites.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Varying the relative concentration of target and oligonucleotides can also affect properties of the selected aptamers. If a good [[binding affinity]] for the selected aptamer is not a concern, then an excess of target can be used to increase the probability that at least some sequences will bind during incubation and be retained. However, this provides no selective pressure for high [[Ligand (biochemistry)|binding affinity]], which requires the oligonucleotide library to be in excess so that there is competition between unique sequences for available specific binding sites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Binding sequence elution and amplification ===
Once the oligonucleotide library has been incubated with target for sufficient time, unbound oligonucleotides are washed away from immobilized target, often using the incubation buffer so that specifically bound oligonucleotides are retained.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With unbound sequences washed away, the specifically bound sequences are then eluted by creating denaturing conditions that promote oligonucleotide unfolding or loss of binding conformation including flowing in deionized water,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; using denaturing solutions containing urea and EDTA,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vater A, Jarosch F, Buchner K, Klussmann S | title = Short bioactive Spiegelmers to migraine-associated calcitonin gene-related peptide rapidly identified by a novel approach: tailored-SELEX | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 31 | issue = 21 | pages = e130 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14576330 | pmc = 275487 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gng130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by applying high heat and physical force.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Upon elution of bound sequences, the retained oligonucleotides are [[Reverse transcriptase|reverse-transcribed]] to DNA in the case of RNA or modified base selections,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; or simply collected for amplification in the case of DNA SELEX.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blank M, Weinschenk T, Priemer M, Schluesener H | title = Systematic evolution of a DNA aptamer binding to rat brain tumor microvessels. selective targeting of endothelial regulatory protein pigpen | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 19 | pages = 16464–8 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11279054 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M100347200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These DNA templates from eluted sequences are then amplified via [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] and converted to single stranded DNA, RNA, or modified base oligonucleotides, which are used as the initial input for the next round of selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Obtaining ssDNA===
One of the most critical steps in the SELEX procedure is obtaining single stranded DNA (ssDNA) after the PCR amplification step. This will serve as input for the next cycle so it is of vital importance that all the DNA is single stranded and as little as possible is lost. Because of the relative simplicity, one of the most used methods is using biotinylated reverse primers in the amplification step, after which the complementary strands can be bound to a resin followed by elution of the other strand with lye. Another method is asymmetric PCR, where the amplification step is performed with an excess of forward primer and very little reverse primer, which leads to the production of more of the desired strand. A drawback of this method is that the product should be purified from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and other left-over material from the PCR reaction. Enzymatic degradation of the unwanted strand can be performed by tagging this strand using a phosphate-probed primer, as it is recognized by enzymes such as [[Exodeoxyribonuclease|Lambda exonuclease]]. These enzymes then selectively degrade the phosphate tagged strand leaving the complementary strand intact. All of these methods recover approximately 50 to 70% of the DNA. For a detailed comparison refer to the article by Svobodová et al. where these, and other, methods are experimentally compared.&lt;ref name="Svobodová"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Svobodová M, Pinto A, Nadal P, O' Sullivan CK | title = Comparison of different methods for generation of single-stranded DNA for SELEX processes | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 404 | issue = 3 | pages = 835–42 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22733247 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-012-6183-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical SELEX, the process of randomized single stranded library generation, target incubation, and binding sequence elution and amplification described above are repeated until the vast majority of the retained pool consists of target binding sequences,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; though there are modifications and additions to the procedure that are often used, which are discussed below.

=== Negative or counter selection ===
In order to increase the specificity of aptamers selected by a given SELEX procedure, a negative selection, or counter selection, step can be added prior to or immediately following target incubation. To eliminate sequences with affinity for target immobilization matrix components from the pool, negative selection can be used where the library is incubated with target immobilization matrix components and unbound sequences are retained.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoltenburg R, Reinemann C, Strehlitz B | title = SELEX--a (r)evolutionary method to generate high-affinity nucleic acid ligands | journal = Biomolecular Engineering | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 381–403 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17627883 | doi = 10.1016/j.bioeng.2007.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Negative selection can also be used to eliminate sequences that bind target-like molecules or cells by incubating the oligonucleotide library with small molecule target analogs, undesired cell types, or non-target proteins and retaining the unbound sequences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haller AA, Sarnow P | title = In vitro selection of a 7-methyl-guanosine binding RNA that inhibits translation of capped mRNA molecules | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 16 | pages = 8521–6 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9238009 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.16.8521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracking selection progression ===
To track the progress of a SELEX reaction, the number of target bound molecules, which is equivalent to the number of oligonucleotides eluted, can be compared to the estimated total input of oligonucleotides following elution at each round.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sefah K, Shangguan D, Xiong X, O'Donoghue MB, Tan W | title = Development of DNA aptamers using Cell-SELEX | language = En | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 1169–85 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20539292 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2010.66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of eluted oligonucleotides can be estimated through elution concentration estimations via 260&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength absorbance&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; or fluorescent labeling of oligonucleotides.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As the SELEX reaction approaches completion, the fraction of the oligonucleotide library that binds target approaches 100%, such that the number of eluted molecules approaches the total oligonucleotide input estimate, but may converge at a lower number.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Caveats and considerations ===
Some SELEX reactions can generate probes that are dependent on primer binding regions for secondary structure formation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are aptamer applications for which a short sequence, and thus primer truncation, is desirable.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lubin AA, Hunt BV, White RJ, Plaxco KW | title = Effects of probe length, probe geometry, and redox-tag placement on the performance of the electrochemical E-DNA sensor | language = EN | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 81 | issue = 6 | pages = 2150–8 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19215066 | doi = 10.1021/ac802317k }}&lt;/ref&gt; An advancement on the original method allows an RNA library to omit the constant primer regions, which can be difficult to remove after the selection process because they stabilize [[secondary structure]]s that are unstable when formed by the random region alone.&lt;ref name="Jarosch2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarosch F, Buchner K, Klussmann S | title = In vitro selection using a dual RNA library that allows primerless selection | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 12 | pages = e86 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16855281 | pmc = 1524915 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemically modified nucleotides ==
Recently, SELEX has expanded to include the use of chemically modified nucleotides. These chemically modified oligonucleotides offer many potential advantages for selected aptamers including greater stability and nuclease resistance, enhanced binding for select targets, expanded physical properties - like increased hydrophobicity, and more diverse structural conformations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinheiro VB, Taylor AI, Cozens C, Abramov M, Renders M, Zhang S, Chaput JC, Wengel J, Peak-Chew SY, McLaughlin SH, Herdewijn P, Holliger P | title = Synthetic genetic polymers capable of heredity and evolution | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6079 | pages = 341–4 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22517858 | pmc = 3362463 | doi = 10.1126/science.1217622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genetic alphabet, and thus possible aptamers, is also expanded using unnatural base pairs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimoto M, Kawai R, Mitsui T, Yokoyama S, Hirao I | title = An unnatural base pair system for efficient PCR amplification and functionalization of DNA molecules | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = e14 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19073696 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamashige R, Kimoto M, Takezawa Y, Sato A, Mitsui T, Yokoyama S, Hirao I | title = Highly specific unnatural base pair systems as a third base pair for PCR amplification | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 2793–806 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22121213 | pmc = 3315302 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr1068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of these unnatural base pairs was applied to SELEX and high affinity DNA aptamers were generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimoto M, Yamashige R, Matsunaga K, Yokoyama S, Hirao I | title = Generation of high-affinity DNA aptamers using an expanded genetic alphabet | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 453–7 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23563318 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7289">[[Image:SBGN-logo-WhiteBackground-1024.png|thumb|right|logo of the Systems Biology Graphical Notation]]

The '''Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)''' is a standard [[graphical representation]] intended to foster the efficient storage, exchange and reuse of information about signaling pathways, metabolic networks, and [[gene regulatory network]]s amongst communities of biochemists, biologists, and theoreticians. The system was created over several years by a community of [[biochemist]]s, [[Modelling biological systems|modelers]] and [[computer scientist]]s.&lt;ref name="Lenov2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Le Novère N, Hucka M, Mi H, Moodie S, Schreiber F, Sorokin A, etal | title=The Systems Biology Graphical Notation. | journal=Nat Biotechnol | year= 2009 | volume= 27 | issue= 8 | pages= 735–41 | pmid=19668183 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19668183 | doi=10.1038/nbt.1558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SBGN is made up of three orthogonal languages for representing different views of biological systems: ''Process Descriptions'', ''Entity Relationships'' and ''Activity Flows''. Each language defines a comprehensive set of symbols with precise semantics, together with detailed syntactic rules regarding the construction and interpretation of maps.  Using these three notations, a life scientist can represent in an unambiguous way networks of interactions (for example [[biochemical]] interactions). These notations make use of an idea and symbols similar to that used by electrical and other engineers and known as the [[block diagram]]. The simplicity of SBGN syntax and semantics makes SBGN maps suitable for use at the high school level.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Some software support for SBGN is already available, mostly for the Process Description language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sbgn.org/Community#SBGN_Software |title=Community#SBGN_Software |publisher=sbgn.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67PufAQwM?url=http://www.sbgn.org/Community#SBGN_Software |archivedate=2012-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SBGN Process Description language ==

[[File:Example-SBGN-PD.png|thumb|right|example of SBGN Process Description map]] The SBGN Process Description (PD) language shows the temporal courses of biochemical interactions in a network. It can be used to show all the [[interactome|molecular interactions]] taking place in a network of biochemical entities, with the same entity appearing multiple times in the same diagram.&lt;ref name="Moodie2011"&gt;Moodie SL, Le Novère N, Demir E, Mi H &amp; Villéger A.

[http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3721/version/4 Nature Precedings (2011) ] {{doi|10.1038/npre.2011.3721.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SBGN Entity Relationship language ==

[[File:Example-SBGN-ER.png|thumb|right|example of SBGN Entity Relationship map]] The SBGN Entity Relationship (ER) language allows to see all the relationships in which a given entity participates, regardless of the temporal aspects. Relationships can be seen as rules describing the influences of entities nodes on other relationships.&lt;ref name="LeNovere2011"&gt;Le Novère N, Demir E, Mi H, Moodie S &amp; Villéger A.

== SBGN Activity Flow language ==

[[File:Example-SBGN-AF.png|thumb|right|example of SBGN Activity Flow map]] The SBGN Activity Flow (AF) language depicts the flow of information between biochemical entities in a network. It omits information about the state transitions of entities and is particularly convenient for representing the effects of perturbations, whether genetic or environmental in nature.&lt;ref name="Mi2009"&gt;Mi H, Schreiber F, Le Novère N, Moodie S, Sorokin A.

==History==

Work on defining a set of symbols to describe interactions and relationships of molecules was pioneered by Kurt Kohn at the [[National Cancer Institute]] with his [[Molecular Interaction Maps]] (MIM).&lt;ref name="Kohn2006"&gt;Kohn KW, Aladjem MI, Weinstein JN, Pommier Y.

The [http://sbgn.org/Events/SBGN-1 meeting that initiated] development of the Systems Biology Graphical Notation took place on February 11–12, 2006, at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), in Tokyo, Japan.

'''''Tagmar''''' is a [[roleplaying game]] (RPG) launched in 1991 by GSA that claims to be the first such Brazilian offering on what was at the time a nascent market.
The game was a typical early 1990s RPG but featured a series of innovations, the main one being that it was a self-contained package with everything necessary to play provided in a single book: rules, setting, magic, creatures and a pre-prepared adventure for beginners.  At the time, RPG books were imported to Brazil and it was necessary to have several to play a game.
Based on the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], Tagmar faced accusations that it was  based on [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] (D&amp;D), especially from ''Dragão Brasil'' magazine, at the time edited by [[Marcelo Cassaro]], while others claimed that it was very different. Due to a variety of factors including price, availability and innovation, such as the unprecedented concept of "Heroic Energy", in a short time Tagmar became a success and gathered a large fan base.
During the 1990s, the "world" of Tagmar was enlarged through the publication of complementary books such as the "Creatures Book" (''Livro de Criaturas'') and "The Empire" (''O Império''). These books provided details on the appearance, skills and habitat of the creatures of Tagmar as well as information about new geographic regions.

This success continued until 1997 when the publisher GSA closed down leaving Tagmar to stagnate.

==History ==
Launched in 1991, the same year that Devir launched [[GURPS]] in Brazil, the first Brazilian RPG is based on the stories of fantasy of [[JRR Tolkien]], the game was accused of be a copy of Dungeons and Dragons, only to be released in 1993 by Grow until then, the system was known only to players who played with the original versions in English. In 1992, GSA published the second Brazilian RPG, O Desafio dos Bandeirantes (The Challenge of the Explorers), set in [[Colonial Brazil]].
Five supplements were published: O Arado de Ouro, O Livro de Criaturas, A Fronteira, the [[gamebook]] Estandarte Sangrento and O Império, however, the label closed in 1997.
In 2004, the authors of Tagmar decided to republish the game, released on an official website, "Tagmar 2" was made available through a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons Non-Commercial license]].

In 2006, Tagmar no longer restricted to the system itself and the scene happened to be adapted to other systems, the first system chosen was the Daemon of Daemon Editora.

'''The Parliamentary Network on the World Bank &amp; International Monetary Fund''' (French: ''Réseau parlementaire sur la Banque mondiale et le FMI'') is an independent inter-parliamentary organization aiming to increase transparency and accountability in [[international financial institutions]].,&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1732606   Markus Krajewski], Legitimizing Global Economic Governance Through Transnational Parliamentarization: The Parliamentary Dimensions of the WTO and the World Bank. Retrieved December 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; notably the [[World Bank Group]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. It consists of over a thousand legislators from 158 World Bank Group and IMF member countries.

==History==

The Parliamentary Network on the World Bank &amp; IMF was founded in 2000 as an independent, non-governmental organization providing a platform for advocacy for Parliamentarians from IMF and [[List of World Bank members|World Bank member countries]];.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2017/09/parliamentary-network-world-bank-imf//   Bretton Woods Project] Inside the institutions: the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank &amp; IMF.

Retrieved July 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transparency International]], etc.

==Structure and governance==

The Parliamentary Network is governed by the Board of Directors currently composed of 10 members elected every two years. The members of the Board represent the regions of [[MENA]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Latin America]], [[East Asia]], and World Bank donor countries. Membership in the Network is open to all elected or nominated parliamentarians from World Bank and IMF member states who currently hold a mandate.

The International Secretariat of the Network is based in [[Paris]], France.

==Objectives==

The Parliamentary Network on the World Bank &amp; IMF is principally focused on increasing [[Open government|transparency]] and [[accountability]] of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund by:

* Strengthening the understanding of the work of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund among parliamentarians
* Providing a channel for parliamentarians to inform the World Bank Group and IMF of legislative priorities on behalf of their constituents
* Ensuring that the voice of parliamentarians is heard on the subjects in which the WBG and IMF have a key role&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2004/02/art-35230/   Bretton Woods Project] Legislators courted but oversight insufficient. Retrieved August 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Grammatical categories}}

In [[linguistics]], the '''topic''', or '''theme''', of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the '''comment''' ('''rheme''' or '''focus''') is what is being said about the topic. This opposition of the given/new information is called [[information structure]]. That the [[information structure]] of a clause is divided in this way is generally agreed on, but the boundary between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus  depends on [[grammatical theory]]. 

The difference between "topic" and [[Subject (grammar)|grammatical subject]] is that topic is used to describe the information structure, or pragmatic structure of a clause and how it coheres with other clauses, whereas the subject is a purely grammatical category. ''Topic'' and ''subject'' must also be distinguished from ''actor'' (or ''agent''), the "doer". In English clauses with a verb in the passive voice, for instance, the topic is typically the subject, while the agent may be omitted or may follow the preposition ''by''. In some languages, word order and other [[Syntax|syntactic phenomena]] are determined largely by the topic–comment (theme–rheme) structure. These languages are sometimes referred to as [[topic-prominent language]]s. Korean and Japanese are often given as examples of this.

The distinction was probably first suggested by [[Henri Weil]] in 1844&lt;ref&gt;H. Weil, De l’ordre des mots dans les langues anciennes compares aux
langues modernes: question de grammaire gnrale. Joubert, 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;. He established the
connection between [[information structure]] and word order. [[Georg von der Gabelentz]] distinguished '''psychological subject''' (roughly topic) and '''psychological object''' (roughly focus). In the [[Prague school]], the dichotomy, termed '''topic–focus articulation''', has been studied mainly by [[Vilém Mathesius]]&lt;ref&gt;V. Mathesius and J. Vachek, A Functional Analysis of Present Day
English on a General Linguistic Basis, ser. Janua linguarum : Series
practica / Ianua linguarum / Series practica. Mouton, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Jan Firbas]], [[František Daneš]], [[Petr Sgall]] and [[Eva Hajičová]]. They have been concerned mainly by its relation to intonation and word-order. [[Mathesius]] also pointed that the topic does not provide new information but connects the sentence to the context. The work of [[Michael Halliday]] in the 1960s is responsible for developing linguistic science through his [[systemic functional linguistics]] model for English&lt;ref&gt;M.A.K.Halliday, An Introduction to Functional Grammar, 2nd ed.
London: Arnold, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions ==

The sentence- or clause-level "topic", or "theme", can be defined in a number of different ways. Among the most common are
*a) the phrase in a clause that the rest of the clause is understood to be about,
*b) a special position in a clause (often at the right or left-edge of the clause) where topics typically appear.

In an ordinary English clause, the subject is normally the same as the topic/theme (example 1), even in the passive voice (where the subject is a patient, not an agent: example 2):
*(1) ''The dog'' bit the little girl.
*(2) ''The little girl'' was bitten by the dog.

These clauses have different topics: the first is about ''the dog'', and the second about ''the little girl''.

In English it is also possible to use other sentence structures to show the topic of the sentence, as in the following:
*(3) ''As for the little girl'', the dog bit her.
*(4) ''It was the little girl'' that the dog bit.

The case of [[Syntactic expletive|expletives]] is sometimes rather complex. Consider sentences with expletives (meaningless subjects), like:

*(6) It is raining.
*(7) There is some room in this house.
*(8) There are two days in the year in which the day and the night are equal in length.

In these examples the syntactic subject position (to the left of the verb) is manned by the meaningless expletive ("it" or "there"), whose sole purpose is satisfying the [[extended projection principle]], and is nevertheless necessary. In these sentences the topic is never the subject, but is determined [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]]. In all these cases, the whole sentence refers to the comment part&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gotze, Stephanie Dipper, and Stavros Skopeteas. 2007. Information Structure in Cross-Linguistic Corpora: Annotation Guidelines for Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Information Structure. Interdisciplinary Studies on Information Structure (ISIS), Working papers of the SFB 632, Vol. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The relation between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus should not be confused with the topic-comment relation in [[Rhetorical structure theory]] Discourse Treebank (RST-DT corpus) where it is defined as "a general statement or topic of discussion is introduced, after which a specific remark is made on the statement or topic" (ex. "[As far as the pound goes,] [some traders say a slide toward support at 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week.]") &lt;ref&gt;L. Carlson and D. Marcu, “Discourse tagging reference manual,” ISI Technical Report ISI-TR-545, vol. 54, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;L. Ermakova and J. Mothe. 2016. Document re-ranking based on topic-comment structure. In X IEEE International Conference RCIS, Grenoble, France, June 1-3, 2016. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Realization of topic–comment ==
Different languages mark topics in different ways. Distinct intonation and word-order are the most common means. The tendency to place topicalized constituents sentence-initially ("topic fronting") is widespread. Topic fronting refers to placing the topic at the beginning
of a clause regardless whether it is marked or not&lt;ref&gt;D. Bring, Topic and Comment. Cambridge University Press, 2011, three
entries for: Patrick Colm Hogan (ed.) The Cambridge Encyclopedia of
the Language Sciences. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Again, linguists disagree on many details. 

Languages often show different kinds of grammar for sentences that introduce new topics and those that continue discussing previously established topics. 

When a sentence continues discussing a previously established topic, it is likely to use pronouns to refer to the topic. Such topics tend to be subjects.  In many languages, pronouns referring to previously established topics will show [[pro-drop]].

=== In English ===
The topic/theme comes first in the clause, and is typically marked out by intonation as well.&lt;ref&gt;MAK Halliday (1994). ''An introduction to functional grammar'', 2nd ed., Hodder Arnold: London, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In other languages===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
* [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]: the topic is normally marked with a [[postposition]] such as {{Nihongo||は|-wa}} or 는/은, ''-(n)eun''.
* In [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian French]], the topic is marked by the postposition « là ». The topic can be a noun or a nominal group but not necessarily : « Voiture-là est jolie deh » ; « Aujourd'hui-là il fait chaud » ; « Pour toi-là n'est pas comme pour moi hein » ; « Nous qui sommes ici-là, on attend ça seulement ».
* So-called free-word order languages (e.g. Russian, [[Czech language|Czech]], to a certain extent [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[German language|German]]) use word-order as the primary means. Usually the topic precedes focus. However, for example in Czech, both orders are possible. The order with comment sentence-initial is referred as ''subjective'' ([[Vilém Mathesius]] invented the term and opposed it to ''objective'') and expresses certain emotional involvement.  The two orders are distinguished by intonation.
* In [[Hebrew language|modern Hebrew]], a topic may follow its comment. In this case, the syntactic subject of the sentence is an expletive זה ("ze", lit. "this"). For example, זה מאד מענין הספר הזה "ze meod meanyen ha-sefer ha-ze" (lit. "This is very interesting this book") means "This book is very interesting".
* In [[American Sign Language#Topic and main clauses|American Sign Language]], a topic can be declared at the beginning of a sentence (indicated by raised eyebrows and head tilt) describing the object, then the rest of the sentence describes what happens to that object.

== Practical applications ==
The main application of the topic-comment structure is in the domain of speech technology, especially the design of embodied conversational agents (intonational focus assignment, relation between information structure and posture and gesture)&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Justine, ed. Embodied conversational agents. MIT press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;. There were some attempts to apply the theory of topic/comment for the information retrieval &lt;ref&gt;A. Bouchachia and R. Mittermeir, “A neural cascade architecture for
document retrieval,” in Neural Networks, 2003. Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on, vol. 3. IEEE, 2003, pp. 1915–1920.&lt;/ref&gt; and the automatic summarization &lt;ref&gt;L. Ermakova, J. Mothe, A. Firsov. A Metric for Sentence Ordering Assessment Based on Topic-Comment

In the [[United States]], when a person applies for a [[mortgage loan]], the [[lender]] makes a credit inquiry about the potential borrower from the national credit bureaus, [[Equifax]], [[Experian]] and [[TransUnion]]. Unless the borrower is opted out, the credit bureaus put the applicants  onto a "trigger list" of "leads" about persons who are interested in new loans. These lists are sold to numerous lenders all over the United States, and soon after the application the applicant starts receiving offers from all parts of the country. The trigger lists contain a significant amount of personal financial information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://realtytimes.com/rtcpages/20060911_mortgageapps.htm Home Mortgage Applications "Trigger" Sales of Private Financial Information]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the buyers of trigger lists are "lead generators" which resell filtered information to borrowers, e.g., of people who live in a certain area and have a certain [[credit score]].

While the [[Federal Trade Commission]] considers the market of "trigger lists" to be a legal business, many people and organizations (such as the [[National Association of Mortgage Brokers]]) consider this a serious breach of privacy and lobby for putting this practice under regulatory controls.

As of now, American consumers may [[opt-out]] from "trigger lists" by calling  1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/protect.shtm FTC.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear non-proliferation==
The [[Zangger Committee]] and the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] maintain lists of items that may contribute to nuclear proliferation; The [[nuclear non-proliferation treaty]] forbids its members to export such items to non-treaty members. these items are said to trigger the countries' responsibilities under the NPT, hence the name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3580">'''Warnock's dilemma''', named for its originator Bryan Warnock, is the problem of interpreting a lack of response to a posting in a [[virtual community]].{{sfn|Holiday|2012|pp=101-103}}  The term originally referred to  [[Electronic mailing list|mailing list discussions]], but has been applied to [[Usenet]] posts, [[blog]]s, [[Internet forum|Web forum]]s, and online content in general.{{sfn|Holiday|2012|p=101}} The dilemma arises because a lack of response does not necessarily imply that no one is interested in the topic, but could also mean for example that readers find the content to be exceptionally good (leaving nothing for commenters to add).{{sfn|Holiday|2012|p=101}}

On many internet forums, only around [[1% rule (Internet culture)|1 percent of users create new posts]], while 9 percent reply and 90 percent are [[lurker]]s that don't contribute to the discussion.&lt;ref name="arthur"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/jul/20/guardianweeklytechnologysection2 What is the 1% rule?] by Charles Arthur, ''The Guardian'', 20 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; When no users reply, the original poster has no way of knowing what lurkers think of their contribution.

Warnock's dilemma leads to online writers and publishers adopting more confrontational writing strategies in order to ensure that they will get a response.{{sfn|Holiday|2012|p=102}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Say Everything: How Blogging Began, What It's Becoming, and Why It Matters|page=259

|first=Scott |last=Rosenberg |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this can also lead publishers to avoid producing the kind of content that might fail to generate comments due to its high quality.{{sfn|Holiday|2012|pp=102-103}}  This problem arises particularly with sites that focus on [[viral content]], such as ''[[Buzzfeed]]'' and ''[[Huffington Post]]''.{{sfn|Holiday|2012|pp=102-103}}

==Original description==

{{cquote|The problem with no response is that there are five possible interpretations:

# The post is correct, well-written information that needs no follow-up commentary. There's nothing more to say except "Yeah, what he said."
# The post is complete and utter nonsense, and no one wants to waste the energy or bandwidth to even point this out.
# No one read the post, for whatever reason.
# No one understood the post, but won't ask for clarification, for whatever reason.
# No one cares about the post, for whatever reason.|||Bryan C. Warnock|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.bootstrap/1127 Re: RFCs: two proposals for change] -- Original description of the dilemma&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since Warnock's original description of the dilemma in August 2000, the expression has become used in the [[Perl]] world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/15407 Re: Warnocked?] -- Post to the Perl 6 language list explaining history and uptake of term&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=December 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2159">In [[mathematics]], a '''weakly symmetric space''' is a notion introduced by the Norwegian mathematician [[Atle Selberg]] in the 1950s as a generalisation of [[symmetric space]], due to [[Élie Cartan]]. Geometrically the spaces are defined as complete [[Riemannian manifold]]s such that any two points can be exchanged by an [[isometry]], the symmetric case being when the isometry is required to have period two. The classification of weakly symmetric spaces relies on that of periodic automorphisms of complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s. They provide examples of [[Gelfand pair]]s, although the corresponding theory of [[Zonal spherical function|spherical functions]] in [[harmonic analysis]], known for symmetric spaces, has not yet been developed.
