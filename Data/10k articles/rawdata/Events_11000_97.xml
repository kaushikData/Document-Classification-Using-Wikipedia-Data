The '''1996 shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue aircraft''' took place on 24 February 1996, when a [[Cuban Air Force]] [[Mikoyan MiG-29UB]] shot down two [[Cessna Skymaster]] aircraft operated by [[Brothers to the Rescue]]. The aircraft had been flying in international waters, as was later shown by Madeleine Albright at the United Nations. Killed in the incident were Cessna pilots [[Carlos Costa (pilot)|Carlos Costa]], Armando Alejandre, Jr., Mario de la Peña, and Pablo Morales.


[[File:BTTR southernmost positions.gif|thumb|right|Map showing the southernmost positions (prior to the incident) of the three aircraft according to US and Cuban data.]] Radar data and screen prints were provided by a United States Customs Service Supervisory Detection Systems Specialist who recorded the entire incident as it happened using surveillance data from a U.S. surveillance radar balloon in the Florida Keys. 
 



[[File:BTTR location of shootdown.gif|thumb|right|The map shows the locations where the two aircraft were reportedly shot down.

==Description==
On 24 February 1996, two of the Brothers to the Rescue [[Cessna Skymaster]]s were shot down by a [[Cuban Air Force]] [[Mikoyan MiG-29UB]], while a second jet fighter, a [[MiG-23]], orbited nearby. Killed in the shootdowns were pilots [[Carlos Costa (pilot)|Carlos Costa]], Armando Alejandre, Jr., Mario de la Peña, and Pablo Morales. A third aircraft, flown by Basulto, escaped.&lt;ref name="Minnesota"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/cases/86-99.html |title = Armando Alejandre Jr., Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena y Pablo Morales v. Republica de Cuba, Case 11.589, Report No. 86/99, OEA/Ser.L/V/II.106 Doc. 3 rev. at 586 (1999) |accessdate = 2007-12-07 |last = [[University of Minnesota]] Human Rights Library |authorlink = |year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed the first aircraft was downed 9 [[nautical mile]]s (10.4 [[statute mile]]s; 16.7&amp;nbsp;km) outside Cuban territorial airspace and the second aircraft was downed 10 nautical miles (11.5 statute miles; 18.5&amp;nbsp;km) outside Cuban airspace.&lt;ref name="Minnesota" /&gt; The aircraft used were [[Cessna 337]]s, a twin-engine civilian light aircraft. A type similar to those owned by Brothers to the Rescue, designated the [[Cessna O-2A Super Skymaster]], was in use by the United States military until 2010. Cuba claimed that the letters USAF were visible on them. It is claimed the Cuban Air Force pilots' radio transmissions proved that they had been identified as belonging to Brothers to the Rescue before the shootdown.&lt;ref name="www1.umn.edu"&gt;Section III, Paragraph 7 of the REPORT Nº 86/99, CASE 11.589, OEA/Ser.L/V/II.106 Doc. 3 rev. at 586 (1999) Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, issued September 29, 1999 [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/cases/86-99.html]&lt;/ref&gt;


The incident was investigated by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). Their report concluded that the authorities in Cuba had notified the authorities in the United States of multiple violations of their airspace since May 1994.&lt;ref name="ICAO"&gt;"Report on the shooting down of two U.S.-registered private civil aircraft by Cuban military aircraft on 24 February 1996", C-WP/10441, June 20, 1996, United Nations Security Council document, [http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N96/164/16/img/N9616416.pdf?OpenElement S/1996/509], July 1, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In at least one case (13 July 1995), the pilot had released leaflets over [[Havana]]. The United States authorities had issued public statements advising of the potential consequences of unauthorized entry into Cuban airspace and had initiated legal actions against Basulto, but had retained his certification to fly during appeal. After Basulto was warned by an [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] official about the possibility of being shot down, he replied, "You must understand I have a mission in life to perform", disregarding the potential danger involved.&lt;ref name="spytrial"&gt;Court testimony from the Cuban spy trial, referred in ''The Miami Herald'' March 13, 2001 at [http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/exile/basulto-testifies.htm "Basulto testifies"]. [[Latin American Studies]].&lt;/ref&gt; He would later say he considered the group's activities to be acts of [[civil disobedience]] against the regime, and a demonstration that such disobedience was possible.&lt;ref name="spytrial" /&gt;

According to Cuban authorities, two light aircraft entered Cuban territorial airspace on 9 and 13 January 1996, and released leaflets which fell on Cuban territory. According to the pilot of one of the aircraft, half a million leaflets were released on 13 January; he also claims they were released outside the 12-mile (22&amp;nbsp;km) Cuban territorial limit and the wind carried them to Havana. This version of events was detailed by Juan Pablo Roque, the man who had returned to Cuba the day before the shootdown and who was later implicated as having helped organize the shootdown as a Cuban spy placed with the group. According to Roque, Basulto had dropped the leaflets from 10 miles north of Havana, not the stated 12 miles, from a high altitude on a day when the winds would carry them south toward Cuba. Specifically, in a Cuban television interview days after the shootdown took place, Roque, from within Cuba, stated, "I personally have violated air space, specifically the last was on 9 January 1996, where I got a call the day before to participate in a flight to Havana where thousands of leaflets were going to be released from a height of more than 9,500 feet at a distance of less than 10 miles from the coast."

Following that incident, the ICAO report states, the Commander of the Anti-Aircraft Defence of the Air Force of Cuba was instructed to intercept any further flights and was authorized to shoot them down, whether or not they had entered Cuban airspace.

On 24 February 1996, the group's aircraft flew another mission. While the Brothers to the Rescue aircraft were still north of the [[24th parallel north|24th parallel]], the Cuban Air Force ordered the scrambling of two military aircraft, a MiG-29 and a MiG-23, operating under the control of a military station on Cuban soil. The MiGs were carrying short-range missiles, bombs, and rockets, and they were flown by members of the Cuban Air Force.&lt;ref name="www1.umn.edu" /&gt;

Two of the group's three aircraft flying that day were shot down. With the downing of each aircraft, the Cuban pilots could be heard celebrating over the radio. Terms like "cojones" were repeatedly used by the Cuban fighter pilots. Their radio transmissions included statements such as "We blew his balls off!"  In a reference to the Cuban MiG pilot's understanding that the aircraft they were attacking were the same ones that had been repeatedly and continuously flying off Cuba's coast, they also transmitted the following, "He won't give us any more fucking trouble." Finally, the Cuban MiG pilots also said, "The other one is destroyed; the other one is destroyed. Homeland or death (''patria o muerte''), you bastards! The other one is also down."&lt;ref&gt;Transcripts of Cuban Military Radio Communications, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Report on the shooting down of two U.S.-registered private civil aircraft by Cuban military aircraft on 24 February 1996, C-WP/10441, June 20, 1996, pp. 35 ff., United Nations, Security Council, S/1996/509, July 1, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued a report that concluded, "The fact that weapons of war and combat-trained pilots were used against unarmed civilians shows not only how disproportionate the use of force was, but also the intent to end the lives of those individuals. It is claimed the extracts from the radio communications between the MiG-29 pilots and the military control tower indicate that they acted from a superior position and showed malice and scorn toward the human dignity of the victims."&lt;ref&gt;Section IV, Paragraph 37, Subsection iii of the REPORT Nº 86/99, CASE 11.589, OEA/Ser.L/V/II.106 Doc. 3 rev. at 586 (1999) Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, issued September 29, 1999 [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/cases/86-99.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Brothers to the Rescue aircraft, with Basulto on board, was also identified for intercept and was to be shot down but escaped.
[[File:José Basulto.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[José Basulto]], aviator and leader of "Brothers to the Rescue" in Miami in 2010]]
Testimony from a US Colonel Buchner expressed support for Cuba's claim that both Brothers aircraft, along with a third flown by Basulto, were only four to five miles off the Cuban coast.&lt;ref&gt;Court testimony of retired US colonel Buchner, reported in ''The Miami Herald'', March 22, 2001, "Fliers downed by MiGs violated Cuban airspace, colonel says".[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/espionage/buchner-testimony.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;The statement by USAF Colonel Buchner is directly contradictory to eye-witness testimony and verified radar data documentation provided by Department of the Treasury, Supervisory Detection Systems Specialist J. Houlihan during sworn testimony before an FAA Administrative Hearing in 1996, and the House of Representatives, Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Committee on International Relations, Washington D.C. September 18, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;House of Representatives, Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Committee on International Relations, Washington D.C. September 18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;   

It is claimed the aircraft that were shot down were both very near (and, in one case, directly above) a U.S fishing vessel named ''Tri-Liner''.&lt;ref name="icao.int"&gt;Sections 3.16 and 3.17 of the Resolution on the Cuban Government's Shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue Adopted by the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) at the Twentieth Meeting of its 148th Session on 27 June 1996 [http://www.icao.int/icao/en/nr/1996/pio199606_c.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Also nearby was the cruise ship ''Majesty of the Seas''.&lt;ref name="icao.int"/&gt;

It is claimed that the ICAO report also states that means other than interception, such as radio communication, had been available to Cuba, but had not been utilized, and that this conflicts with the ICAO principle that interception of civil aircraft should be undertaken only as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 3.18, 3.19 and 3.20 of the Resolution on the Cuban Government's Shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue Adopted by the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) at the Twentieth Meeting of its 148th Session on 27 June 1996 [http://www.icao.int/icao/en/nr/1996/pio199606_c.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also claimed the Cuban Air Force did not make any attempt to direct the aircraft beyond the boundaries of national airspace, guide them away from a prohibited, restricted or danger area or instruct them to effect a landing.&lt;ref&gt;Section III, Paragraph 8 of the REPORT Nº 86/99, CASE 11.589, OEA/Ser.L/V/II.106 Doc. 3 rev. at 586 (1999) Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, issued September 29, 1999 [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/cases/86-99.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions to the incident==

===International===
Following the incident, the United Nations Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1067|Security Council Resolution 1067]] (1996), a U.S.-sponsored resolution condemning Cuba.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Dissenting members believed that the resolution was singling out Cuba for condemnation, and instead should have issued a call which urged both states to refrain from shooting down civilian airplanes as well as to prevent the improper use of civil aviation.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations press release SC/6247: Security Council condemns use of weapons against civil aircraft; calls on Cuba to comply with international law. 27 July 1996 [https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1996/19960727.sc6247.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In Miami, reaction from the exile community was swift. The late [[Jorge Mas Canosa]], co-founder and leader of the [[Cuban American National Foundation]], condemned the attack: "For two warplanes from the Castro government to shoot down two unarmed civilian aircraft with American flags on a humanitarian mission should be considered an act of war against the US".&lt;ref name="Notisur" /&gt;

After the attack, the pilots responsible were the twin brothers, El Teniente (LTC) Colonel Lorenzo Alberto Perez Perez and his "Guy in Back," El Teniente Colonel (LTC) Francisco Perez Perez. Both were charged in the United States for their role in the attack.&lt;ref name="Minnesota" /&gt;

===Cuban response===
Miguel Alfonso Martinez of the Cuban Foreign Ministry said that the two aircraft that were shot down were "not common civilian aircraft" as suggested by the US. "This is not the case of an innocent civilian airliner that, because of an instrument error, departs from an air corridor and gets into the airspace of another country". "These people knew what they were doing. They were warned. They wanted to take certain actions that were clearly intended to destabilize the Cuban government and the US authorities knew about their intentions".&lt;ref name="Notisur"&gt;"U.S. TIGHTENS SANCTIONS AGAINST CUBA AFTER DOWNING OF TWO EXILE PLANES OFF CUBAN COAST". In NotiSur - Latin American Political Affairs ISSN 1060-4189, Volume 6, Number 9 March 1, 1996 {{cite web|url=http://ssdc.ucsd.edu/news/notisur/h96/notisur.19960301.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030915162206/http://ssdc.ucsd.edu/news/notisur/h96/notisur.19960301.html |archivedate=2003-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups sympathetic to Cuba, while not approving the shootdown, noted "the policies of the United States government of indefensible hostility against the island of Cuba that sit at the heart of the matter", citing constant threats and a history of military and paramilitary attacks on Cuba from the US and paramilitary groups.&lt;ref name="cubasolidarity"&gt;"The Cuban Downing of the Planes. The News We Haven't Been Hearing...." Article from [[Cuba Solidarity]] {{cite web|url=http://www.cubasolidarity.net/planes2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926000735/http://www.cubasolidarity.net/planes2.html |archivedate=2006-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film: ''Shoot Down''==

''[[Shoot Down]]'', a documentary film that illustrates the incident from the Brothers to the Rescue perspective, was released in 2006 and rereleased in an updated, edited version on January 25, 2008. It was directed by Cristina Khuly, niece of downed pilot Armando Alejandre Jr.&lt;ref name="ShootDownMovie"&gt;Shoot Down, a 2006 film about the shootdown, co-produced by the niece of one of the four victims.[http://www.theshootdown.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''493 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Auruncus and Viscellinus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 261 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 493 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''''Andersonville''''' is a 1996 American television film directed by [[John Frankenheimer]] about a group of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers during the [[American Civil War]] who are captured by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] and sent to an infamous [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Confederate prison camp]].

The film is loosely based on the diary of John Ransom, a Union soldier imprisoned there. Although certain points of the plot are fabricated, the general conditions of the camp accurately match Ransom's descriptions, particularly references to the administration of the camp by Captain [[Henry Wirz]]. His line on escaping prisoners is very similar to the book, "The Flying Dutchman [Wirz] offers to give two at a time twelve hours the start".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ransom |first= John L. |author2= Catton, Bruce |title= Andersonville Diary: Life Inside the Civil War's Most Infamous Prison |publisher= Berkley Trade |date=May 1994 |isbn= 0-425-14146-2| page = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film begins with a group of Union soldiers being captured and forced to surrender at [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], Virginia, in June 1864. They are transported to prisoner-of-war [[Camp Sumter]], near Andersonville, Georgia. When they enter, they discover a former comrade, named Dick Potter, who was captured at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], who explains the grim realities of daily existence in the camp – primarily the lack of shelter, clean water, and regular food supplies. He also states the danger of a rogue group of Union soldiers, called the "[[Andersonville Raiders|Raiders]]", who hoard the camp's meager rations, and lure unsuspecting "fresh fish" – newly captured soldiers – into their area of the camp, to attack and rob them.

With every able-bodied man required for fighting, young teenagers and old men are used as guards. At one watch tower, manned by two young guards, a Union soldier offers money for some corn. He is instructed to step over the "dead line" fence and approach the watch tower to trade, which contradicts the rules of the camp. But reluctantly, compelled by need, the soldier steps over the line, and (in a macabre type of game) the soldiers in the next watch tower shoot him dead.

As the story unfolds, the unit captured at the beginning of the film ally with some inmates, and help them by working on their tunnel under the [[stockade]] wall. Eventually it is complete, but one man tries to inform the guards, in hope of receiving a reward. He is captured and "TT" (meaning tunnel traitor) is cut into his forehead as a warning. The escape is attempted one night, and all goes well until the last man is spotted and shot, and the dogs are unleashed. In a very short time, most escapees are back in the camp and placed in standing [[stocks]] as punishment.

The situation with the Raiders eventually becomes unbearable, as group after group of new prisoners are targeted upon arrival. Night raids are made, with possessions being taken from tents and prisoners injured or killed by the Raiders. After a banjo is stolen, one man fights to get it back but is badly beaten. Things progressively get worse until finally one man decides he has seen enough of the "vultures out to rob and murder the new boys". He rallies support from the disparate groups, and within minutes hundreds of his comrades are charging the Raiders' camp. A massive and deadly riot ensues.

In the end the Raiders are beaten, stolen goods are redistributed to their owners, but many want them all hanged outright. But upon the insistence of a few, a request for a legitimate trial is made to [[Henry Wirz|Captain Wirz]], the Confederate commander of the prison camp. A trial is held, with a jury made up of new internees, which ultimately results in the six ring-leaders being found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. After the executions life becomes relatively peaceful, but the cold reality of starvation, and lack of sanitation or medical care, begins to set in as [[emaciation]], [[dysentery]], [[scurvy]], and [[fever]] take their toll, causing many to die. As the film ends, an announcement is made by Wirz that all prisoners are to be [[prisoner exchange|exchanged]] – the surviving Federal soldiers leave the camp, filing past their dead comrades on the way to the trains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.movieprop.com/tvandmovie/reviews/andersonville.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Against a view of the present-day [[Camp Sumter#Andersonville National Cemetery|Andersonville National Cemetery]], the movie's end coda reads:
:''In 1864–5, more than 45,000 Union soldiers were imprisoned in Andersonville. 12,912 died there. The prisoner exchange never happened. The men who walked to the trains were taken to other prisons, where they remained until the war ended. After the war, Wirz was hanged, the only soldier to be tried and executed for war crimes committed during the Civil War.''

==Production==
The mini series was a pet project of mogul [[Ted Turner]], an [[American Civil War]] enthusiast who wanted to bring to the screen a series of historically accurate films about the conflict. After the critical acclaim and financial success of his previous production ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'' in 1993, he would go on to produce its prequel ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' in 2003. All were massive productions on huge scales.

''Andersonville'' was filmed on location on a farm some fifty miles south of Atlanta (about a hundred miles north of the actual location of the camp) where a huge set was built (not quite to scale) of the actual camp. Accurate in detail down to the officer's quarters outside the camp gates, the fifty foot high raw timber walls and thousands of ragged tents, a working stream, and even a full scale railway depot with half of a locomotive made of wood were built on the property. At any given time there were hundreds of extras employed every day, many of whom were [[American Civil War reenactment|Civil War reenactors]] who came from all over the nation to take part in the production. Their deep devotion to the subject matter and attention to detail gave the film much of its authenticity. Many of the extras were also college students, both men and women brought in by the busload for the larger scenes. At its height more than four thousand extras a day were employed, making it necessary to have an ultra early call time of three a.m. for a general set call of seven. Dozens of additional makeup, hair, wardrobe and production staff were needed for these scenes, which actually went very well due to military style organization with the "troops" even being marched in platoons from the preparation tents to the set.

Shot in the early to late fall of 1994, it was a typical southern season of change with the weather proving difficult at best. With temperatures swinging between extremely hot to cold and rainy, the heavy red clay that makes up Georgia soil would turn into a sludge up to three feet deep during rains and would solidify to rock hard status a day later when temperatures soared. Long days took their toll on the cast and crew and the situation came to a head when disaster struck at the end of principal photography. 
 
The critical scenes involving the trials and hanging of the raiders were shot over two days with the raw film being shipped out to Los Angeles labs every few days. The crate containing this film was lost in transit by the shipping company and though there was tremendous effort to find it the film was never located. Shooting had just wrapped with sets being torn down and the farm location restored. This necessitated a partial re-building of the set on location in [[North Carolina]] and a gathering of all the principal actors involved in the scenes for a very costly re-shoot which took about a week to complete.[[File:John Frankenheimer on the set of "Andersonville".JPG|thumbnail|John Frankenheimer, director of Andersonville on set in 1994.]]

==Awards==
The program won a 1996 Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Directing for a Miniseries or a Special for director John Frankenheimer. It was nominated in six other categories as well, including a nomination for cinematographer, [[Ric Waite]].&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Cinematographer Ric Waite dies, Shot 'Footloose,' '48 Hrs.,' won Emmy |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118050540?refCatId=13 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruce Mendenhall''' (born April 14, 1951) is a convicted [[United States|American]] murderer and accused [[serial killer]].

The body was found by the security guard on duty that night. A long haul trucker, his truck was found to contain the blood of numerous other murdered or missing women.&lt;ref name=Feb2017/&gt;  He has been charged with the murders of three other women at truck stops in [[Alabama]], [[Indiana]] and Tennessee.&lt;ref name="Mercury News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/natbreakingnews/ci_6362448 |title=Police: Man arrested in truck stop death |author=Greg Giuffrida |date=2007-07-12 |work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is still under investigation for murders in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Texas]]&amp;mdash;some of which carry the death penalty.

==Biography==
Mendenhall grew up in [[Crawford County, Illinois]]. 

He was married to Linda, and they had two daughters. Linda, who has since died, had reportedly gone [[blindness|blind]] from [[diabetes]]. Mendenhall never had problems with the law, though his wife and friends knew he kept a gun illegally in his truck.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Tenn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WKRN" /&gt;--&gt;

==Arrest==
A resident of [[Albion, Illinois]], Mendenhall was arrested at the TA truck stop on Interstate 24 in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] on July 12, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.police.nashville.org/news/media/2007/07/12.htm |title=Homicide detectives arrest suspected serial killer |publisher=[[Metropolitan Nashville Police Department]] |date=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Detective Sgt. Pat Postiglione spotted a truck that matched [[surveillance]] footage from the night Sara Nicole Hulbert was murdered at the same truck stop.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-07-13-trucker_N.htm |title=Police: Truck driver spoke of 6 killings |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon inspection of the vehicle, a large quantity of bloody clothing and identification and personal effects of an Indianapolis woman, who went missing the day before, was found in a plastic sack along with blood spots scattered around the inside of his cab to include the steering wheel and even on his hands when arrested &lt;ref name="NC52"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=6879398 |title=Suspected Serial Killer Waives Right To Hearing |date=2007-08-02 |work=www.newschannel5.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201556/http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=6879398 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mendenhall was taken into custody.&lt;ref name="Mercury News" /&gt; Police catalogued 300 items from the truck including a rifle, knives, handcuffs, [[latex]] gloves, several weapons cartridges, black tape, a nightstick, and [[sex toy]]s.&lt;ref name="WSMV"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wsmv.com/news/13792102/detail.html |title=Group Suspected Accused Trucker Years Ago |author=Jeremy Finley |date=2007-07-31 |work=[[WSMV-TV|WSMV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213532/http://www.wsmv.com/news/13792102/detail.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sampling of these items turned up the [[DNA]] of five different women. On August 2, 2007, Mendenhall waived his right to a [[preliminary hearing]].&lt;ref name="NC52" /&gt;

==Victims==
Mendenhall's victims were primarily young [[prostitute]]s, usually found shot, though detectives have determined that his method of killing may have changed over the years.&lt;ref name="NC5"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=6851661 |work=www.newschannel5.com |title=Mendenhall Suspected In Bucksnort Murder Case |date=2007-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202532/http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=6851661 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During questioning, he implicated himself in the shooting death of Hulbert, whose body was found on June 26, 2007. 

He has also implicated himself in the shooting death of Symantha Winters, whose body was found June 6, 2007 in a trash can at a truck stop in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]]. She had a criminal record showing at least one previous charge of prostitution.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; On August 17, 2007, a [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]] [[grand jury]] [[indictment|indicted]] Mendenhall for the murder of Winters. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to life. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanondemocrat.com/Courts/2018/03/02/Mendenhall-gets-guilty-verdict|title=Mendenhall gets guilty verdict|last=|first=|date=|website=Lebanon Democrat|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another victim killed on July 11, 2007 at a [[Pilot Flying J|Flying J]] truck stop on Interstate 465 in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] was recently found. Carma Purpura, a 31-year-old mother of two, was last seen at the far-southside [[Indianapolis]] truck stop. On April 10, 2008, Marion County Prosecutor Carl Brizzi charged Mendenhall with murder in the case. DNA tests link a large quantity of the blood from Mendenhall's truck cab to the woman's parents. Investigators also found her cell phone, ATM card and clothing she wore on the day she disappeared. Four years later her remains were discovered just off I-65 in Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/10/24/remains-found-kentucky-identified-indy-woman/92701086/ |work=[[Indianapolis Star]] | title=Remains found in Kentucky identified as Indy woman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, police in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]] charged Mendenhall with the murder of Lucille "Gretna" Carter, who was found nude in a trash bin with a plastic bag taped around her head on July 1. She was shot with a [[.22 caliber]] weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/southsouthwest/chi-truckstopjul28,1,2598995.story |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |title=Truck driver charged in Alabama woman's death |date=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators said Mendenhall was initially cooperative, but subsequently ceased to implicate himself in other murders.&lt;ref name="KOB"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://kob.com/article/stories/S147858.shtml?cat=520
|title=Was Silver City woman victim of serial killer? |website=www.kob.com |date=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police are investigating the possibility that Mendenhall is responsible for other murders in the region including:

*Deborah Ann Glover, an [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] prostitute&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Tenn"/&gt;--&gt; whose body was found near a [[Motel 6]] in [[Suwanee, Georgia]] on January 29, 2007. Police are certain that Mendenhall was in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on the day Glover was shot.&lt;ref name="NC5" /&gt;

==Related Crimes==

While he was in jail, Mendenhall's wife died of natural causes and he came upon some insurance money. He separately approached two inmates with offers to pay them $15,000 to murder the three associates that Mendenhall had implicated in his original statement to police. One of the murders was to be performed in a "copycat" fashion to lead police to believe the killer was still at large. 

For the crime of conspiracy to commit murder he was convicted and sentenced to an additional 30 years.

Mendenhall was also initially accused of solicitation of the murders of the two detectives involved in his arrest and questioning. Those charges were later dropped.

'''''David Bowie Is''''' was a touring [[Exhibit design|museum exhibit]] displaying history, artifacts and information about the life, music, films, tours, and art of English [[singer-songwriter]] and actor [[David Bowie]].
[[File:David Bowie Is at the Brooklyn Museum.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A view of the Brooklyn Museum in New York flying a ''David Bowie Is'' banner|A view of the Brooklyn Museum in New York flying a ''David Bowie Is'' banner in March 2018]]

The show opened in March 2013 at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]], and ended in July 2018 at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in [[New York City]]. Over its 5 year run, it stopped at 12 museums around the world and attracted over 2 million visitors.

At each museum, the exhibit displayed about 500 objects, often with a few hundred unique to that particular museum.&lt;ref name=MSN2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/musicnews/david-bowie-is-a-feast-for-the-senses-and-the-bowie-obsessive-arrives-at-the-brooklyn-museum/ar-BBJKii4 | title="David Bowie Is," A Feast For the Senses (and the Bowie Obsessive), Arrives at the Brooklyn Museum | date=1 March 2018 | accessdate=13 March 2018 | first=Corey | last=Seymour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An accompanying documentary film, also titled ''David Bowie Is'', was directed by [[Hamish Hamilton (director)|Hamish Hamilton]], Katy Mullan, and [[Hanif Kureishi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clarke|first1=Donald|title=Inside the David Bowie time capsule|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/inside-the-david-bowie-time-capsule-1.2712376|accessdate=8 April 2018|work=The Irish Times|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the exhibit closed in July 2018, it was announced that in early 2019 a new, virtual version of the exhibit would be released on virtual and augmented reality platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://www.davidbowie.com/blog/2018/7/16/david-bowie-is-virtual-press-release | title=David Bowie Is Virtual | date=16 July 2018 | accessdate=20 July 2018 | journal=DavidBowie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
Near the end of 2010, an archivist for Bowie's collection contacted the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) and asked if they'd be interested in a display. Bowie had saved most of the artifacts, costumes, and props from his career and had almost 75,000 pieces in a private collection.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/arts/music/david-bowie-is-opens-at-the-victoria-and-albert-in-london.html | title=Ch-Ch-Ch Changes of David Bowie | date=22 March 2013 | accessdate=13 March 2018 | first=Roslyn | last=Sulcas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowie allowed Victoria Broackes and [[Geoffrey Marsh (museum director)|Geoffrey Marsh]], the V&amp;A museum curators, free access to his archives for the show, although he did not get involved with how the pieces were displayed, nor the narrative of the show itself.&lt;ref name=MSN1&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/musicnews/david-bowie-retrospective-starts-its-final-bow-at-brooklyn-museum/ar-BBJLzJ3 | title=David Bowie Retrospective Starts Its Final Bow at Brooklyn Museum | date=1 March 2018 | accessdate=13 March 2018 | first=Mary | last=von Aue | journal=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to museum directors at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], “David Bowie asked that the exhibit open in London and close here [in New York]”.&lt;ref name=MSN1 /&gt; The V&amp;A Museum worked with 59 Productions and Real Studios to design the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://59productions.co.uk/project/david-bowie-is/| title=a ground-breaking exhibition on a legendary artist | accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the show was first booked at the V&amp;A Museum, it was not generally felt that the exhibit would be very successful.&lt;ref name=MSN1 /&gt; However, it became the museum's fastest selling show with over 300,000 visitors. The success of the show at the V&amp;A museum resulted in the decision to take the exhibit on tour, and it has sold roughly two million tickets across 11 cities around the world as of March 2018.&lt;ref name=MSN1 /&gt; As of 2018, the "David Bowie Is" exhibition holds the record for being the most visited exhibit in the V&amp;A Museum's history.&lt;ref name=MSN1 /&gt;

When Bowie [[Death of David Bowie|died in early 2016]], the museum tour was almost canceled, with concerns for if and how the show would go on. There were also discussions as to whether to keep the name in the present tense (David Bowie ''Is'').&lt;ref name=MSN1 /&gt; The exhibit, which was at the [[Groninger Museum]] in the Netherlands at the time, instead extended the show for 4 weeks to allow grieving fans to attend.&lt;ref name="Guard1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-is-exhibition-300-items-13m-visitors-but-no-bakelite-saxophone | title=David Bowie exhibition opens as fans can't wait to say 'I love you' till Tuesday | first=Mark | last=Brown | date=11 January 2016 | accessdate=13 March 2018 | journal=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit contents==
A typical stop of the exhibit included around 500 objects, including over 60 performance costumes, handwritten lyrics, and Bowie's own oil paintings.&lt;ref name=MSN1 /&gt; The exhibition was organized thematically rather than chronologically. It included outfits designed by [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Hedi Slimane]], [[Issey Miyake]], [[Vivienne Westwood]] and [[Kansai Yamamoto]]. There were over 50 video pieces, including television performances, music videos and concert footage.&lt;ref name=MSN2 /&gt; Music journalist Dan Hyman wrote in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' of the Chicago exhibition that the retrospective taught him five things about Bowie; Namely that Bowie was "... a Fantastic Painter and Illustrator…", "…an Avid Collector of Minutiae…", "…a Style Icon…", "…a Tech Geek at Heart…", and "…an Unflinching Self-Editor…".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hyman|first1=Dan|title='David Bowie Is' Incredible: Inside the Enigmatic Star's New Retrospective|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/david-bowie-is-museum-retrospective-20140923|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some museums included items unique to their country or city, reflecting Bowie's connection to the area. For example, in New York, where Bowie lived, Brooklyn Museum's Matthew Yokobosky said “We have the original backdrop from when he performed in "[[The Elephant Man (play)|The Elephant Man]]" on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and moments from when he worked on [[Julian Schnabel]]’s film ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'', on the life of New York artist [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]. … While most of the ''[[Young Americans]]'' album was recorded in Philadelphia, "[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]" was actually recorded in New York City. That's how [[John Lennon]] just happened to stop by the studio that day. He [Lennon] actually did a drawing for David in the studio and I have that drawing in the show.”&lt;ref name=MSN1 /&gt; Yokobosky also spoke about how and why they got the letters "BOWIE" for the exhibit: “The first time I met with Bowie’s archivist at the archive, I looked down one of the aisles and saw a photograph of the letter W resting on a case. I asked what it was, and the archivist told me that it corresponded to one of the letters from Bowie’s [[Heathen Tour|New York marathon tour]] in 2002, when he played five theaters in [[five boroughs]] of the city in five days—and every night they moved these brilliant letters which spelled out his name in light bulbs. Well, I saw that tour in the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theater]], and I just blurted out, ‘I want the letters.’ They hadn’t been seen since that tour, and we spent two months trying to figure out how to get them to work again.”&lt;ref name=MSN2 /&gt;

While in Berlin at the [[Martin-Gropius-Bau]] museum, the exhibition added pieces from Bowie’s time in West Berlin, his collaborations with [[Iggy Pop]], and his [[Berlin Trilogy]]: ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' (1977), ''[["Heroes" (David Bowie album)|"Heroes"]]'' (1977), and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979).&lt;ref name=MSN1 /&gt;

When ''David Bowie Is'' opened in Tokyo, pieces from Japanese collaborator Kansai Yamamoto were highlighted, having designed costumes during Bowie's [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]] (1972) and [[Aladdin Sane]] (1973) periods.&lt;ref name=MSN1 /&gt;

==Technology==
The V&amp;A Museum worked with audio company [[Sennheiser]] to create a custom audio experience for the exhibit. Originally the curators were nervous to ask visitors to wear headphones, fearing it would isolate them. As visitors walked around the exhibit, the audio changed as they entered "spheres" of Bowie's work, relating to particular events, people or cities that the artist has worked in.&lt;ref name=MSN1 /&gt; The headphones required no interaction; the music and information you hear simply changed as you approached different parts of the exhibit.&lt;ref name=MSN2 /&gt; Producer [[Tony Visconti]], who worked with Bowie for many years, created a unique [[megamix]] from the master tapes of more than 60 Bowie songs for the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/musicnews/david-bowie-up-close-and-personal-how-the-“david-bowie-is”-exhibit-was-made/ar-AAxz5D7?ffid=gz | title=David Bowie, up close and personal: How the “David Bowie Is” exhibit was made | date=20 May 2018 | accessdate=22 May 2018 | last=Marcotte | first=Amanda | work=Salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the exhibition included a cavernous room with large video screens displaying various Bowie live performances throughout the years and featuring surround sound, in which visitors were asked to remove their headphones.&lt;ref name=MSN2 /&gt;

The '''Days of Prayer for Rain in the State of Texas''' was a designated period from Friday, April 22, 2011, to Sunday, April 24, 2011, during which Texas governor [[Rick Perry]] asked that Texans [[prayer|pray]] for "the healing of our land [Texas]" and for an end to the [[2010–13 Southern United States drought|drought]].&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite web

Perry designated the Days of Prayer in a gubernatorial [[proclamation]] issued on April 21.&lt;ref name="Perry" /&gt; Precedents for his action included similar initiatives in Texas at the municipal level and a prayer service for rain led by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] governor [[Sonny Perdue]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="Galbraith"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.texastribune.org/texas-state-agencies/governors-office/texas-governor-declares-weekend-of-prayer-for-rain/|title=Texas Governor Declares Weekend of Prayer for Rain|last=Galbraith|first=Kate|date=April 21, 2011|work=[[The Texas Tribune]]|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proclamation, which did not specify a text for the prayer and called for the "Days of Prayer" to begin on [[Good Friday]], received some criticism.&lt;ref name="Connelly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2011/04/we_obey_rick_perry_our_rain_pr.php|title=We Obey Rick Perry: Our Rain Prayer|last=Connelly|first=Richard|date=April 22, 2011|work=[[Houston Press]]|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HABERMAN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasvoice.com/gov-rick-perry-issues-proclamation-days-prayer-rain-texas-1073533.html|title=Gov.

==Aftermath==
The drought continued to worsen for four months following the Days of Prayer. While only 15-17% of the state was undergoing exceptional drought by late April, the percentage grew to 50% a month later, and by late June, more than 70% of the state was experiencing exceptional drought conditions, a level at which it persisted until August 18, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DM_tables.htm?TX&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DM_state.htm?TX,S {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924085402/http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DM_state.htm?TX%2CS |date=2011-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/01/us-drought-south-idUSTRE77060620110801 | work=Reuters | title=Harsh drought in South hitting far and wide, report says | date=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42705038/ns/weather/t/texas-governor-urges-rain-prayers-wildfire-battles-continue/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/07/15/270485/minnesota-temperatures-extreme-bachmann-and-pawlenty/&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the drought conditions subsided by the end of summer, when rain returned to various parts of Texas.

The first major rain in the state after the Days of Prayer came 168 days later on October 9, 2011.

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2015}}
The '''deorbit of ''Mir''''' was the controlled [[atmospheric re-entry]] of the modular Russian space station ''[[Mir]]'' which was carried out on 23 March 2001. Major components ranged from about 5 to 15 years in age, and included the [[Mir Core Module]], [[Kvant-1]], [[Kvant-2]], [[Kristall]], [[Spektr]], [[Priroda]], and [[Mir Docking Module|Docking Module]]. Although [[Russia]] was optimistic about ''Mir'''s future, the country's commitments to the [[International Space Station]] project left no funding to support ''Mir''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mir Destroyed in Fiery Descent | publisher = [[CNN]] | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/03/23/mir.descent/index.html | accessdate = 10 November 2009 | date = 22 March 2001 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091121134003/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/03/23/mir.descent/index.html | archivedate = 21 November 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deorbit was carried out in three stages. The first stage was waiting for atmospheric [[Drag (physics)|drag]] to [[Orbital decay|decay the orbit]] to an average of {{convert|220|km}}.  This began with the docking of [[Progress M1-5]]. The second stage was the transfer of the station into a {{convert|165|×|220|km|adj=on}} orbit. This was achieved with two burns of the Progress M1-5's control engines at 00:32 [[UTC]] and 02:01 UTC on 23 March 2001.  After a two-orbit pause, the third and final stage of ''Mir'''s deorbit began with the firing of Progress M1-5's control engines and main engine at 05:08 UTC, lasting a little over 22 minutes.  The atmospheric re-entry at the altitude of {{convert|100|km}} occurred at 05:44 UTC near [[Nadi]], [[Fiji]].

==Process==
{{External media|video1=[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/imagery/videos/mirdeorbit.mpg An animation showing the deorbiting process.]|video2=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQd9Ejkbiw A video showing ''Mir'' debris reentering the atmosphere over Fiji.]}}
[[File:Mir reentry map.svg|thumb|left|''Mir'' reentry track]]
The Mir Deorbit Monitoring Group, whose members were located in the [[Mission control center#RKA Mission Control Center|Russian Mission Control Center]] (RMCC) and [[ESOC]], was monitoring the whole dynamic phase of operation. Both RMCC control rooms in [[Moscow]] were used for the massive media presence during the final stages of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/mir_deorbit_status_2001_10.doc|title=Main dynamic operations during final phase of Mir de-orbit|publisher =ESA Multimedia|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time reports from RMCC were provided via [[teleconference]] during each deorbit burn to [[ESA]] spokespersons and representatives from national agencies. Video transmissions from RMCC were also made available to ESOC.

Two out of three Progress M1-5 propulsion firings, at approximately 90 minute intervals, were used to bring the [[perigee]] of ''Mir'' down to an altitude of {{convert|160|km}} above the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="Zarya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zarya.info/Tracking/Mir/Mir-Re-entry2.php|title=Mir Re-entry|publisher =Zarya|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tough contact with the atmosphere occurred at {{convert|100|km}} altitude, when some of the external light elements of ''Mir'' were torn off due to the rush through the rarefied air.&lt;ref name="Zarya"/&gt; At an altitude of {{convert|90|km}} sufficient heating from ''Mir''{{'s}} hull created a glowing halo of [[hot plasma]].&lt;ref name="Zarya"/&gt; At about that time, the orbital complex broke apart and several of ''Mir'''s elements, surrounded by the plasma, were visible from [[Fiji]] against the evening sky.&lt;ref name="Zarya"/&gt; Television pictures were transmitted around the world within a few minutes of the event.&lt;ref name="Zarya"/&gt; The entire process lasted from about 16:20 to 20:29 local [[solar time]]. A short press conference was held in RMCC to cover the final stage of deorbit.

An official statement announced that ''Mir'' "ceased to exist" at 05:59:24 GMT. The final tracking of ''Mir'' was conducted by a [[United States Army]] site on [[Kwajalein Atoll]].&lt;ref name="TAC-REN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reentrynews.com/Mir/sequence.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ilBuhOVb?url=http://www.reentrynews.com/Mir/sequence.html |archivedate=3 August 2009 |title=The Final Days of Mir |work=Reentry News |publisher=The Aerospace Corporation |accessdate=7 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Space Agency]], German [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]] and U.S. [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] also assisted with tracking ''Mir'' during its final orbit and reentry.&lt;ref name="ESA-discharge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/ESA6X0UM5JC_Life_0.html|title=Honourable discharge for Mir space station|date=5 March 2001|publisher=ESA|accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{cite news|bibcode=2002ESASP.498...41P|title=NASA JSC trajectory operational support for entry of Space Station MIR|last=Paul|first=Scott D|year=2002|publisher=Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debris==
At the time, ''Mir'' was the largest spacecraft ever to reenter the Earth's atmosphere, and there were concerns that sizeable pieces of debris, particularly from the docking assemblies, gyrodynes and external structure, could survive [[atmospheric re-entry|reentry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Böckstiegel|first=Karl-Heinz|title=Space Law|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=1995|chapter=A.IX.3.1.2|isbn=0-7923-0091-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QpoZaM4twoC&amp;pg=PP2181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid debris fall, New Zealand issued international warnings to ships and aircraft traveling in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] area.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1225482.stm|title=Japan warns about falling Mir debris|publisher =[[BBC News]]|accessdate=7 November 2010|date=20 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy director of New Zealand's Maritime Safety Authority, Tony Martin, said that the chances of debris hitting ships would be very small.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; A similar situation occurred in Japan, whose residents were warned to stay indoors during the forty-minute period when debris was most likely to fall.

The debris spread about ±{{convert|1500|km}} along track and ±{{convert|100|km}} laterally, reduced from the earlier estimate due to the steeper re-entry angle.&lt;ref name="Zarya"/&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}
[[Image:Boxer (dog).jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Boxer (dog)|Boxers]] with docked tails.  The dog in front also has cropped ears.]]
'''Docking''' is the [[amputation|removal]] of portions of an animal's [[tail]]. While docking and '''bobbing''' are more commonly used to refer to removal of the tail, the term [[cropping (animal)|cropping]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puppys-place.com/ear_cropping.html|title=Ear Cropping - What You Need To Know About Ear Cropping|work=Puppy's Place}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is used in reference to the ears. Tail docking occurs in one of two ways. The first involves constricting the blood supply to the tail with a rubber [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] for a few days until the tail falls off. The second involves the severance of the tail with surgical scissors or a scalpel.&lt;ref name="defra"/&gt;  The length to which tails are docked varies by breed, and is often specified in the breed standard.

At least 170 dog breeds have [[Natural bobtail|naturally occurring bobtail]] lines. These appear similar to docked dogs but are a distinct naturally occurring phenotype.

==History==

===Purpose===
Historically, tail docking was thought to prevent rabies, strengthen the back, increase the animal's speed, and prevent injuries when [[Rat-baiting|ratting]], [[dog fighting|fighting]], and [[Bait (dogs)|baiting]].&lt;ref name="defra"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626075746/http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/welfare/domestic/awbillconsulttaildocking.pdf A review of the scientific aspects and veterinary opinions relating to tail docking in dogs]&lt;/ref&gt; In early Georgian times{{clarify|date=June 2012}} in the United Kingdom a tax was levied upon working dogs with tails, so many types of dog were docked to avoid this tax.&lt;ref name="defra"/&gt; The tax was repealed in 1796 but that did not stop the practice from persisting.

Tail docking is done in modern times either for [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]], [[therapeutic]], or [[Aesthetics|cosmetic]] purposes. For dogs that work in the field, such as some [[hunting dog]]s,  [[herding dog]]s, or [[terrier dog]]s, tails can collect [[Burr (fruit)|burr]]s and [[Foxtail (diaspore)|foxtail]]s, causing pain and infection and, due to the tail's wagging, may be subject to abrasion or other injury while moving through dense brush or thickets. Bones in the tail can be broken by impact in the field, causing spinal injury to the tail, or terriers can become stuck underground, necessitating being pulled out by the tail, in which case the docked tail protects the dog from spinal injury or trauma.

===Modern practice===
Docking of puppies younger than 10 to 14 days old is routinely carried out by both breeders and veterinarians without anesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdb.org/defra/sub1.htm|title=DEFRA - CDB Submission|work=cdb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of these procedures state that most tail dockings are done for aesthetic reasons rather than health concerns and are unnecessarily painful for the dog. They point out that even non-working show or pet dogs are routinely docked. As a result, tail defects that docking proponents claim makes docking necessary in the first place are perpetuated in the breeds.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} They point to the many breeds of working dogs with long tails that are not traditionally docked, including [[Pointer (dog breed)|English Pointer]]s, [[Setter]]s, [[Herding dog]]s, and [[Foxhound]]s. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Frequently-asked-questions-about-canine-tail-docking.aspx|title=Canine Tail Docking FAQ|website=www.avma.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Robert Wansborough argued in a 1996 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottvet.co.uk/tailwag/docking1.txt |title=Cosmetic tail docking of dogs tails |last=Wansborough |first=Robert |publisher=Australian Veterinary Journal |date=1 July 1996 |accessdate=2007-12-31 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071116194221/http://www.scottvet.co.uk/tailwag/docking1.txt |archivedate=16 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
that docking tails puts dogs at a disadvantage in several ways. First, dogs use their tails to communicate with other dogs (and with people); a dog without a tail might be significantly handicapped in conveying fear, caution, aggression, playfulness, and so on.

Certain breeds use their tails as rudders when swimming, and possibly for balance when running, so active dogs with docked tails might be at a disadvantage compared to their tailed peers. In 2007, Stephen Leaver, a graduate student at the University of Victoria, published a paper  on tail docking which found that tail length was important in the transmission of social cues. The study found that dogs with shorter tails (docked tails) would be approached with caution, as if the approaching dog was unsure of the emotional state of the docked dog. The study goes on to suggest that dogs with docked tails may grow up to be more aggressive. The reasoning postulated by Tom Reimchen, UVic Biologist and supervisor of the study, was that dogs who grew up without being able to efficiently transmit social cues would grow up to be more anti-social and thus more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id%3Dc42371b7-8b74-4e75-8d85-e19bbf161361%26k%3D67117 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109203423/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=c42371b7-8b74-4e75-8d85-e19bbf161361&amp;k=67117 |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wansborough also investigated seven years of records from an urban veterinary practice to demonstrate that undocked tails result in less harm than docked tails.

===Influence of kennel clubs===
Critics point out that kennel clubs with breed standards that do not make allowance for uncropped or undocked dogs put pressure on owners and breeders to continue the practice. Although the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) says that it has no rules that require docking or that make undocked animals ineligible for the show ring,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akc.org/events/conformation/faqs.cfm faq] American Kennel Club&lt;/ref&gt; standards for many breeds put undocked animals at a disadvantage for the [[conformation show]] ring. The American breed standard for boxers, for example, recommends that an undocked tail be "severely penalized."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akc.org/breeds/boxer/breed_standard.cfm Boxer Breed Standard] American Kennel Club&lt;/ref&gt;

The AKC position is that ear cropping and tail docking are "acceptable practices integral to defining and preserving breed character and/or enhancing good health,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/position_statements.cfm#earcropping Ear Cropping, Tail Docking and Dewclaw Removal] American Kennel Club Canine Legislation Position Statements&lt;/ref&gt; even though the practice is currently opposed by the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]].&lt;ref name="AVMA policy: Ear Cropping and Tail Docking of Dogs"&gt;[http://www.avma.org/issues/policy/animal_welfare/tail_docking.asp AVMA.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125121912/http://www.avma.org/issues/policy/animal_welfare/tail_docking.asp |date=25 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
Today, many countries ban cropping and docking because they consider the practices unnecessary, painful, cruel or [[mutilation]]. In Europe, the cropping of ears is prohibited in all countries that have ratified the [[European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals]]. Some countries that ratified the convention made exceptions for tail docking.&lt;!-- see chart below for details--&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Show dogs are no longer docked in the United Kingdom. A dog docked before 28 March 2007 in Wales and 6 April 2007 in England may continue to be shown at all shows in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland throughout its life. A dog docked on, or after, the above dates, regardless of where it was docked, may not be shown at shows in England and Wales where the public is charged a fee for admission. Where a working dog has been docked in England and Wales under the respective regulations, however, it may be shown where the public is charged a fee, so long as it is shown “only to demonstrate its working ability”. It will thus be necessary to show working dogs in such a way as to demonstrate their working ability and not conformity to a standard. A dog legally docked in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, or abroad may be shown at any show in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

In [[England and Wales]], [[ear cropping]] is illegal, and no dog with cropped ears can take part in any Kennel Club event (including agility and other non-conformation events). Tail docking is also illegal, except for a few working breeds; this exemption applies only when carried out by a registered veterinary surgeon.

The [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]] (RCVS), the regulatory body for veterinary surgeons in the United Kingdom, has stated they consider tail docking to be "an unjustified mutilation and unethical unless done for therapeutic or acceptable prophylactic reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report| url= http://www.cdb.org/vets/guidelines.htm | title= RCVS guidelines on docking | work= Council of Docked Breeeds | date= 12 November 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 a veterinary surgeon was brought before the RCVS disciplinary council for "disgraceful professional conduct" for carrying out cosmetic docking. The surgeon claimed that the docking was performed to prevent future injuries, and the case was dismissed for lack of evidence otherwise. Although cosmetic docking is still considered unacceptable by the RCVS, no further disciplinary action has been taken against vets performing docking.

The [[Animal Welfare Act 2006]] makes the docking of dogs' tails a criminal offence, except for working dogs such as those used by the police force, the military, rescue services, pest control, and those used in connection with lawful animal shooting. Three options were presented to Parliament in March 2006 with Parliament opting for the second:
* An outright ban on docking dogs' tails (opposed by a majority of 278 to 267)
* A ban on docking dogs' tails with an exception for working dogs (supported by a majority of 476 to 63)
* Retention of the status quo.

Those convicted of unlawful docking are liable to a fine of up to £20,000, up to 51 weeks of imprisonment or both.

In [[Northern Ireland]] legislation known as Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 made tail docking illegal except for certain working dogs. .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/04/05/npets05.xml | title= Neglectful dog owners could face prosecution | work= The Daily Telegraph | date=5 April 2007 | accessdate=2007-12-30 | location=London | first=Charles | last=Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland docking of any breed is illegal. The [[Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006]] contains provisions prohibiting the mutilation of domesticated animals. However, the Scottish Government has carried out a consultation on this issue and have declared that they intend to legislate to bring the law in Scotland in line with the law in England and Wales, meaning that there will be an exemption for certain breeds of working dogs. This is due to the increase in serious spinal trauma reported in field dogs with undocked tails. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/scotland-s-ban-on-tail-docking-of-dogs-lifted-1-4248625&lt;/ref&gt;

|Canada has no federal law banning pet cosmetic surgery. The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association opposes all cosmetic practices.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadianveterinarians.net/documents/cosmetic-alteration&lt;/ref&gt; Two provinces have provincial legislation against tail docking, ear cropping, and most cosmetic surgeries:
* Illegal since 2015 in [[Prince Edward Island]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ear cropping, tail docking not allowed under P.E.I. animal welfare act|url=http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/News/Local/2015-11-16/article-4344788/Ear-cropping,-tail-docking-not-allowed-under-P.E.I.-animal-welfare-act/1|accessdate=19 March 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three provincial veterinary associations have bans on their veterinarians performing tail docking, ear cropping, and most cosmetic surgeries:
* Since 2008 by the [[New Brunswick]] Veterinary Medical Association (NBVMA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No more nip and tuck for show dogs: N.B. vets|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/no-more-nip-and-tuck-for-show-dogs-n-b-vets-1.751116|accessdate=19 March 2016|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Provincial veterinary associations with ear cropping bans are open to a future ban of tail docking:
* Since 2013 the [[Saskatchewan]] Veterinary Medical Association banned cosmetic ear cropping (bylaw 33.6) &lt;ref&gt;http://svma.sk.ca/uploads/pdf/BYLAWS%202015%20FINAL%20COPY%20FOR%20WEBSITE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://test.svma.sk.ca/newsletters/feb13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Don Rodrigo''''' is an [[opera]] in three acts by [[Alberto Ginastera]], the composer's first opera, to an original [[Spain|Spanish]] [[libretto]] by [[Alejandro Casona]].  Ginastera composed the opera on commission from the Municipality of the City of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].  The first performance was at the [[Teatro Colón]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] on 24 July 1964 with [[Carlo Cossutta]] in the title role. The production was directed by Jorge Petraglia and conducted by [[Bruno Bartoletti]].

On February 22, [[1966 in music|1966]], [[Plácido Domingo]] had his international breakthrough by singing the title role of this opera at the US premiere of the work by the [[New York City Opera]]. Other cast members included Jeannine Crader as Florinda, [[Spiro Malas]] as Teudiselo, the king's tutor, and David Clatworthy as Don Julian, Florinda's father. [[Julius Rudel]] conducted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835228-1,00.html "A Sense of Adventure".  ''Time'', 4 March 1966.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the opera received 9 performances at New York City Opera. In November 1967 the production was also given, still with [[Plácido Domingo]], on tour at the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] in [[Los Angeles]].  Ginastera prepared from the opera a concert work for soprano and orchestra, which received its own first performance in October 1964.

Malena Kuss has published a detailed study of Ginastera's use of motives and of Argentine musical idioms in the opera.&lt;ref&gt;Malena Kuss, "Type, Derivation, and Use of Folk Idioms in Ginastera's ''Don Rodrigo'' (1964)".  ''Latin American Music Review'' (''Revista de Música Latinoamericana''), '''1(2)''', 176-195 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;  Pola Suares Urtubey has published an analysis of the dramatic structure of the opera.&lt;ref&gt;Pola Suares Urtubey, "Alberto Ginastera's ''Don Rodrigo''".  ''Tempo'' (New Ser.), '''74'''. pp. 11-18 (Autumn, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The setting is [[Toledo, Spain]] in the 8th century.  A note is that Don Rodrigo is also the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name for [[Roderic]], the last [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king of [[Spain]].  The three acts of the opera are divided into nine scenes linked by interludes, with labeling of the scenes as follows:

''Act I''
* Scene 1: ''Victory''
* Scene 2: ''Coronation''
* Scene 3: ''Secret''

''Act II''
* Scene 4: ''Love''
* Scene 5: ''Outrage''
* Scene 6: ''Message''

''Act III''
* Scene 7: ''Dream''
* Scene 8: ''Battle''
* Scene 9: ''Miracle''

The scenes mirror each other in a format resembling a dramatic palindrome, with Scene 1 mirrored in Scene 9, Scene 2 mirrored in Scene 8, and so on, with Scene 5 forming the dramatic climax and fulcrum of the story.

At the start, Don Rodrigo has avenged an attack on his father.  He is then about to be crowned King of Spain.  Don Julian, Governor of Ceuta in Africa, introduces the King to his daughter Florinda.  Rodrigo promises Don Julian that he will look after her as a daughter if she is permitted to stay at the royal court.  At the coronation of Rodrigo, Florinda drops the crown.  Although some regard this accident as a baleful sign, Rodrigo then retrieves the crown and places it on his own head.  Historically, a chest in the Vault of Hercules has contained a locked mystery, which every King of Spain has respected since ancient times.  However, Rodrigo opens the locked chest, where he sees the secret in the form of an Arab flag and a curse.  The curse states that he who has opened the chest will be the last of his dynasty and that the Arabs will enslave Spain.

Later, Florinda bathes in a fountain, which Rodrigo sees.  He goes to Florinda’s bedroom at night, and forces himself on her.  Rodrigo then abandons her.  Florinda writes to her father, angrily calling for revenge on Rodrigo.  

Don Julian raises a rebellion against Don Rodrigo.  At the battle at Guadalete, Don Julian is victorious against Don Rodrigo, which allows the Moors to enter Spain, fulfilling that part of the curse.  Rodrigo becomes a penniless vagrant, and eventually finds shelter with a blind hermit.  Florinda eventually discovers Rodrigo there.  Rodrigo confesses his sins, and finally dies in Florinda's embrace.

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. ''The Illyrians'', 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, page 96, "From Bouthoe to Epidamnus, a Greek city, the ..."&lt;/ref&gt; city of '''Epidamnos''' or '''Epidamnus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἐπίδαμνος}}),&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] ''Geography'' vi.316&lt;/ref&gt; later the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] '''Dyrrachium''' (modern [[Durrës]], [[Albania]], c. 30&amp;nbsp;km W of [[Tirana]]) was founded in 627 BC&lt;ref&gt;Mogens Herman Hansen, ''An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis: An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation''y  ,2005,page 330: "Epidamnos was founded in either 627 or 625 (Hieron. Chron.)"&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Illyria]] by a group of colonists from [[Corinth]] and Corcyra (modern [[Corfu]]).&lt;ref name=rhodes&gt;[[P. J. Rhodes|Rhodes, P.J.]] ''A History of the Classical Greek World 478-323 BC''. 2nd edition. Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]]'s ''Politics'' several times draws for examples on the internal government of Epidamnos, which was run as a tight oligarchy that appointed a ruling magistrate; tradesmen and craftsmen were excluded from power, until internal strife produced a more democratic government. The exiled oligarchs appealed to Corcyra while the democrats enlisted the help of Corinth, initiating a struggle between the two mother cities described by [[Thucydides]] as a cause of the [[Peloponnesian War]]. Individual trading with the local Illyrians was forbidden at Epidamnos: all traffic was through the authorized city agent or ''poletes''. In the fourth century BC the [[city-state]] was part of the kingdoms of [[Cassander]] and [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]. The general vicinity of Epidamnus was called '''Epidamnia'''.&lt;ref&gt;James Augustus St. John, ''The History of the Manners and Customs of Ancient Greece'', 1842 Volume 3, page 275 (reprint 2003, {{ISBN|1-4021-5441-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dyrrhachium ==
In 229 BC, when the Romans seized the city the "-damnos" part of the name was inauspicious to Latin ears, and its name, as it was refounded, became Dyrrhachium. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (6.x.8) says "the modern [[Ancient Roman|Roman]] city is not the ancient one, being at a short distance from it. The modern city is called Dyrrhachium from its founder." The name ''Dyrrachion'' is found on coins of the fifth century BC; in the Roman period ''Dyrrachium'' was more common. However, the city maintained a semi-autonomy and was turned into a Roman colony.

Dyrrachium was the landing place for Roman passengers crossing the [[Ionian Sea]] from [[Brundisium]], which made it a fairly busy way-station. Here commenced the [[Via Egnatia]], the Roman military road to [[Thessalonica]] that connected Roman Illyria with [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]]. The city itself was part of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], more specifically [[Epirus Nova]]. In 48 BC [[Pompey]] was based at Dyrrachium and beat off an attack by [[Julius Caesar]] (see [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]). In AD 345 the city was levelled by an earthquake and rebuilt on its old foundations.

In the 4th century AD, Dyrrachium was made the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Epirus nova]]. Thus its [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Durrës|Archbishopric]] became the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of all dioceses in the province.

The name "Epidamnos" was still used by the Byzantines, as for example in the 13th-century ''[[Synopsis Chronike (Skoutariotes)|Synopsis Chronike]]'', referring to contemporary events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/php/pdf_pager.php?rec=/metadata/9/b/0/metadata-181-0000011.tkl&amp;do=71268_07.pdf&amp;pageno=594&amp;pagestart=1&amp;width=369&amp;height=578&amp;maxpage=930&amp;lang=el Synopsis Chronike, published by K. Sathas, Paris, 1894, p. 344 (pdf 594), line 31, and pdf pages 617, 684]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman remains==
The modern city of [[Durrës]] is built directly over the ancient site, so it is primarily on the basis of inscriptions and serendipitous finds that some idea of its monuments has been formed. Inscriptions offer evidence on the following Roman monuments: an [[aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]] constructed by [[Hadrian]] and restored by [[Alexander Severus]] bears a dedicatory inscription at Arapaj, a short distance from Durazzo: (''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' III, 1-709); the [[Roman temple]] of Minerva; the Temple of Diana (''CIL'' III, 1-602), which is perhaps the one mentioned by [[Appian]] (''BCiv''. 2.60); the equestrian statue of L. Titinius Sulpicianus (''CIL'' III, 1-605); the library (''CIL'' m, 1-67). The last inscription mentions that for the dedication of the library 24 gladiators fought in pairs. The conjecture that there was an amphitheater in the city is confirmed by a passage from the fifteenth-century ''[[Skanderbeg|Vita di Skanderbeg]]'' by [[Marin Barleti]]: ''"amphitheatrum mira arte ingenioque constructum"''.

As a result of occasional discoveries, the following data are available: a 3rd-century mosaic pavement with a female head surrounded by garlands of vegetables and flowers, which brings to mind those painted on Apulian vases; remains of houses covered by other layers, the lowest of which, of the Greek era, was found at a depth of 5 m.

Columns with Corinthian capitals and sections of finished marble revetment, discovered on the nearby hillside at Stani, belong probably to the Temple of Minerva or to the Capitolium. In the [[necropolis]] east of the hills that stand above the city have been found a stele of Lepidia Salvia, a sarcophagus with a scene of the [[Calydonian Boar]] hunt (now at Istanbul), and numerous Roman tombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=epidamnos P.C. Sestieri, The Princeton encyclopedia of classical sites. Stillwell, Richard. MacDonald, William L. McAlister, Marian Holland. Princeton, N.J. Princeton University Press. 1976.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical sources not mentioned in the text: [[Strabo]] 5.283; 6.316,323,327; [[Ptolemy]] 3.12; [[Dio Cassius]]. 41.49; [[Pomponius Mela]] 2.56; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] ''Natural History'' 3.145; 4.36; 6.217; 14.30; 19.144; 32.18. ''CIL'' refers to the series of published inscriptions ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]].''

'''Fred Vann Cherry''' (March 24, 1928 – February 16, 2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suffolknewsherald.com/2016/02/17/former-pow-cherry-dies/ |title=Former POW Cherry dies |newspaper=Suffolk News-Herald |first=Tracy |last=Agnew |date=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[colonel]] and [[command pilot]] in the [[U.S. Air Force]].  A career fighter pilot, he served in the [[Korean War]], the [[Cold War]] and the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pownetwork.org/bios/c/c082.htm |title=Biography of Fred V. Cherry|website= P.o.W. Network|access-date= March 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Cherry was born March 24, 1928, in [[Suffolk, Virginia]] into a poor farming family. He attended [[racially segregated]] public schools there.  In 1951, Cherry graduated from [[Virginia Union University]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].

==Military career==
On June 29, 1951, after his college graduation, Cherry enlisted in the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)|Aviation Cadet Training Program]] of the U.S. Air Force, and was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]]. He was awarded his [[Aviator badge|pilot wings]] at [[Webb Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]] on October 25, 1952.&lt;ref name="veteran tributes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fred V. Cherry|url=http://www.veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=816|website=www.veterantributes.org|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean War===
Cherry was soon serving in the Korean War, where he flew [[F-84 Thunderjet]]s on more than 100 [[Military operation|combat missions]], with the [[58th Fighter Wing|58th Fighter-Bomber Wing]], which was stationed at [[Daegu International Airport|Taegu Air Base]] in [[South Korea]]&lt;ref name="veteran tributes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stars stripes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Bart|title=Fred Cherry, POW in North Vietnam for seven years, dies at 87|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fred-cherry-vietnam-pow-for-seven-years-dies-at-87/2016/02/20/56fe152c-d688-11e5-9823-02b905009f99_story.htm|accessdate=20 February 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam War===
During a combat mission on October 22, 1965, Cherry's [[F-105 Thunderchief]] fighter-bomber was shot down over [[North Vietnam]]. Cherry ejected and landed with a broken ankle and wrist, and a crushed shoulder.  He was immediately captured by North Vietnamese militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=3500 |title=Fred Vann Cherry Bio|work= Military Times |access-date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherry was the first and highest ranking black officer among [[U.S. Prisoners of War during the Vietnam War]].  According to Cherry, his North Vietnamese captors wanted him to make public statements about racial intolerance in the United States, but he refused.  As a result,  Cherry spent 702 days in [[solitary confinement]] and was tortured or placed in punishment for 93 days in a row.  Cherry's jailers placed U.S. pilot [[Ensign]] Porter Halyburton, a Southern white man, in Cherry's cell in the hopes that the two men would become antagonists.  Instead, the two pilots helped each other to survive confinement and became very good friends. After seven years as a [[prisoner of war]], Cherry was released from captivity on February 12, 1973.&lt;ref name="stars stripes" /&gt; Cherry told the story of his POW's experience to Wallace Terry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War|date=1984|author=[[Wallace Terry|Terry, Wallace]]|isbn= 978-0-394-53028-4|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career in Air force===
After returning home, Cherry discovered that his wife, Shirley Brown, had taken all of his life savings after the Air Force declared him [[missing in action]] and started dating another man.  Cherry started legal proceedings with the Air Force to have back salary and other payments returned to him.&lt;ref name="stars stripes" /&gt;

After Vietnam, Cherry attended the [[National War College]] and was assigned to the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].  He retired from the Air Force with over 30 years of service on 1 September 1981.&lt;ref name="stars stripes" /&gt;

==Later life==
In 1982, the [[United States Court of Claims]] found the Air Force negligent in handling Cherry's military pay and awarded him $38,449 in compensation.  At the time of the award, Cherry stated that he would contest the decision, saying that he wanted more of the $129,000 that his wife had received from the Air Force.&lt;ref name="compensation"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Franklin|first1=Ben A.|title=FORMER P.O.W.

Following his retirement from active duty, [[President Ronald Reagan]] commissioned Cherry to serve on the [[Korean War Veterans Memorial]] Advisory Board.

Cherry also served as the Director of Technical Support Services for E.H. White &amp; Co. and as Marketing Manager for Data Transformation Corp. Most recently, Cherry has served as Chief Executive Officer for Cherry Engineering and Support Services, and as Director of SilverStar Consulting.&lt;ref name=SilverStar /&gt;

==Death==
Cherry died of [[cardiac disease]] on February 16, 2016 at a hospital in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="stars stripes" /&gt; He is buried with full military honors at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

==Legacy==
A school named after Cherry, Colonel Fred Cherry Middle School, scheduled to open in the Fall of 2018, will seat 800 students. It is the fifth and newest middle school in Suffolk Public Schools in [[Suffolk, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Suffolk News Herald|date=9 February 2017|url=http://www.suffolknewsherald.com/2017/02/09/new-school-named-after-cherry/|title=New School Named After Cherry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''"From Hell" letter''' (also called the "'''Lusk letter'''")&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite news|author=Grove, Sophie |title=You Don’t Know Jack: A new museum exhibition opens the case file on Jack the Ripper—and affords a grim look at the London of the time—a city made for murder|magazine=Newsweek|date=June 9, 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/140770?GT1=43002|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maybrick/&gt; is a letter that was posted in 1888 along with half a human kidney by a person who claimed to be the serial killer known as [[Jack the Ripper]], who killed and mutilated at least five female victims in the [[Whitechapel]] area of London over a period of several months. The exact number of victims has never been proven, and the identity of the perpetrator has remained unsolved.&lt;ref name=Maybrick/&gt;

The letter was postmarked on 15 October 1888 and was received the following day by [[George Lusk]], the chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]]. It was accompanied by a preserved section of a human kidney; the letter's writer claimed to have eaten the other half. The police received a large number of letters claiming to be from the murderer, at one point having to deal with an estimated 1,000 letters related to the case, but the "From Hell" message is one of the few that has received serious attention as possibly being genuine. Opinions on the matter have remained divided.&lt;ref name=Maybrick&gt;{{cite book|title=The Maybrick A to Z|first=Christopher|last=Jones|pages=162–165|isbn=9781906823009|publisher=Countyvise Ltd. Publishers|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several fictional works have referred to the Lusk letter, an example being the thriller novel ''[[Dust and Shadow]]''.&lt;ref name=Dust/&gt;

&lt;!--- ATTENTION: DO NOT FIX THE SPELLING ERRORS. THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE OF WHAT THE ACTUAL LETTER SAID.---&gt;

The original letter and the kidney which accompanied it have been lost, along with other items that were contained in the Ripper police files.

== Background ==
The news media reacted with alarm at the fact that a multiple murderer was on the loose; the 31 August 1888 death of [[Mary Ann Nichols]] resulted in numerous articles about the individual known as "Leather Apron" or "the Whitechapel murderer". The grotesque mutilation of Nichols and later victims were generally described as involving their bodies "ripped up" and residents spoke of their worries of a "ripper" or "high rip" gang. However, the identification of the killer as "Jack" the Ripper did not take place until after 27 September, when the offices of [[Central News Agency (London)|Central News Ltd]] received the [["Dear Boss" letter]]. The message's writer listed Jack the Ripper as his "trade name" and vowed to continue killing until arrested, also threatening to send the ears of his next victim to the police.&lt;ref name=Sugden/&gt;

While the newsmen considered the letter a mere joke, they decided after two days to notify [[Scotland Yard]] of the matter. The double murder of [[Elizabeth Stride]] and [[Catherine Eddowes]] took place the night that the police received the "Dear Boss" letter. The Central News people received a second communication known as the [["Saucy Jacky" postcard]] on 1 October 1888, the day after the double murder, and the message was duly passed over to the authorities. Copies of both messages were soon posted to the public in the hopes that the writing style would be recognised. While the police felt determined to discover the author of both messages, they found themselves overwhelmed by the media circus around the Ripper killings and soon received a large amount of material, most of it useless.&lt;ref name=Sugden/&gt;

== Analysis ==
[[File:Jack-the-Ripper-The-Nemesis-of-Neglect-Punch-London-Charivari-cartoon-poem-1888-09-29.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An 1888 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' illustration depicts the murderer as a demonic spectral figure, the "Nemesis of Neglect", stalking London.]]

Hundreds of letters claiming to be from the killer were posted at the time of the Ripper murders, but many researchers argue that the "From Hell" letter is one of a handful of possibly authentic writings received from the murderer.&lt;ref name=Sugden/&gt; Its author did not sign it with the "Jack the Ripper" pseudonym, distinguishing it from the earlier [["Dear Boss" letter]] and [["Saucy Jacky" postcard]], as well as their many imitators. The handwriting is also similar in the earlier two messages but dissimilar in the one "From Hell".&lt;ref name=Quest/&gt; The letter was delivered to Lusk personally without reference to the police or to the British government, which could indicate animosity toward Lusk or toward the local Whitechapel community of which he was a member.&lt;ref name=Unearthing/&gt;

The "From Hell" letter is written at a much lower literacy level than the other two, featuring numerous errors in spelling and grammar. Scholars have debated whether this is a deliberate misdirection, as the author observed the silent ''k'' in "knif" and ''h'' in "while". The formatting of the letter also features a cramped writing style in which letters are pressed together haphazardly; many ink blots appear in a manner which might indicate that the writer was unfamiliar with using a pen.&lt;ref name=Sugden/&gt; The formatting of the message might point to it being a hoax by a well-educated individual, but some researchers have argued that it is the genuine work of a partly functional but deranged individual.&lt;ref name=Quest/&gt;&lt;ref name=Unearthing/&gt;

Opinions of those that have looked into the case are divided. The possibility has been raised that all of the communications supposedly from the Whitechapel murderer are fraudulent, acts done by cranks or by journalists seeking to increase the media frenzy even more. [[Scotland Yard]] had reason to doubt the validity of the latter yet ultimately did not take action against suspected reporters.&lt;ref name=Maybrick/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sugden/&gt; However, the many differences between the "From Hell" letter and vast majority of the messages received has been cited by some figures analysing the case, such as a forensic handwriting expert interviewed by the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] and another interviewed by the [[Discovery Channel]], as evidence to view it as maybe the only authentic letter.&lt;ref name=Quest/&gt;&lt;ref name=Unearthing&gt;{{cite episode|title=Jack the Ripper|series=[[List of programs broadcast by Discovery Channel|Unearthing Ancient Secrets]]|network=[[Discovery Channel]]|season=1|number=7|date=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary reason this letter stands out more than any other is that it was delivered with a small box containing half of what doctors later determined was a human [[kidney]], preserved in [[Distilled spirit|spirits]]. One of murder victim [[Catherine Eddowes]]' kidneys had been removed by the killer. Medical opinion at the time was that the organ could have been acquired by medical students and sent with the letter as part of a hoax.&lt;ref name=Maybrick/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sugden/&gt; Lusk himself believed that this was the case and did not report the letter until he was urged to do so by friends.&lt;ref name=DouglasJ-MO-p54-55&gt;{{cite book|author1=Douglas, John |author2=Mark Olshaker|year=2001|title=The Cases That Haunt Us|publisher=New York, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster|pages=54–55|isbn=978-0-7432-1239-7|title-link=The Cases That Haunt Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments in favour as to the letter's genuineness sometimes state that contemporary analysis of the kidney by Dr. [[Thomas Openshaw]] of the [[London Hospital]] found that it came from a sickly [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] woman who had died within the past three weeks, evidence that it belonged to Eddowes. However, these facts have been in dispute as contemporary media reporting at the time as well as later recollections give contradictory information about Openshaw's opinions. Historian [[Philip Sugden (historian)|Philip Sugden]] has written that perhaps all that can be concluded given the uncertainty is that the kidney was human and from the left side of the body.&lt;ref name=Maybrick/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sugden&gt;{{cite book|first=Philip|last=Sugden|authorlink1=Philip Sugden (historian)|title=The Complete History of Jack the Ripper|publisher=[[Little Brown]]|date=March 2012|isbn=9781780337098|chapter=Chapter 13: Letters From Hell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary police lead found that shopkeeper Emily Marsh had encountered a visitor at her shop, located in London's [[Mile End Road]], with an odd, unsettling manner in both his appearance and speech. The visitor asked Marsh for the address of Mr. Lusk, which he wrote in a personal notebook, before abruptly leaving. He was described as a slim man wearing a long black overcoat at about six feet in height that spoke with an Irish accent, his face featuring a dark beard and mustache. While the event took place the day before Lusk received the "From Hell" message and occurred in the area in which it is considered to have been postmarked, the fact that Lusk received so many hoax letters during this time means that the suspicious individual may have been another crank.&lt;ref name=Sugden/&gt;

Forensic handwriting expert Michelle Dresbold, working for the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary series ''[[MysteryQuest]]'', has argued that the letter is genuine based on the peculiar characteristics of the handwriting, particularly the "invasive loop" letter "y"s. The [[Offender profiling|criminal profiling]] experts in the program also created a profile of the killer, stating that he possessed a deranged animosity towards women and skills at using a knife. Based on linguistic clues (including the use of the particular spelling of the word "prasarved" (preserved), Dresbold felt that the letter showed strong evidence that the writer was Irish or of Irish extraction, linking the letter to Ripper suspect [[Francis Tumblety]]. Tumblety was an itinerant [[Irish-American]] [[Quackery|quack doctor]] who was [[mental illness|mentally ill]] and who had resided in London during the year of the murders. He had multiple encounters with the law and a [[misogyny|strong dislike of women]], as well as a background collecting body parts. However, after arresting him at the time as a suspect, the police ended up releasing him on bail, having failed to find hard evidence against him. He ultimately died of a heart condition in the U.S. in 1903.&lt;ref name=Quest&gt;{{cite episode|title=Jack the Ripper|series=[[MysteryQuest]]|network=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|season=1|number=8|date=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugden has also written that the author may have had an Irish background but also stated that he may have had [[Cockney]] mannerisms.&lt;ref name=Sugden/&gt;

The purported diary of [[James Maybrick]], another man who has been proposed as a [[Jack the Ripper suspects|Ripper suspect]], contains references to the "From Hell" letter, particularly the alleged cannibalism. However, even if the diary is assumed to be genuine, the handwriting does not match that of the letter at all.&lt;ref name=Maybrick/&gt; A ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' article has referred to the diary rumor as a "hoax" that is one of several "bizarre hypotheses" relating to the case.&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/philip-sugden/the-complete-history-of-jack-the-ripper/|publisher=''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''|title=The Complete History of Jack the Ripper|accessdate=September 11, 2015|date=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jack the Ripper murders are regarded as the first internationally publicised set of serial killings, with the perpetrator never conclusively identified. They have attracted much attention for decades,&lt;ref name=Quest/&gt; with fictional works referring specifically to the Lusk letter. The graphic novel ''[[From Hell (comic)|From Hell]]'' about the Ripper murders takes its name from the letter, created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Eddie Campbell]]. The work was originally published in serial form from 1989 to 1996, first collected as a single piece in 1999, and adapted into a [[From Hell (film)|2001 feature film]] starring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Heather Graham]]. The comic series features the actual killer as a main protagonist, going into his tortured mind and warped justifications for the murders. Cultural commentators such as Professor Elizabeth Ho have highlighted the way in which the work comments "on the present's relationship to the past", with text and image placed "in critical tension".&lt;ref name=Deadline&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2014/11/from-hell-tv-show-jack-the-ripper-graphic-novel-fx-don-murphy-1201286057|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|accessdate=September 11, 2015|title=‘From Hell’ Drama Based On Jack The Ripper Graphic Novel In Works At FX|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Empire&gt;{{cite book|title=Neo-Victorianism and the Memory of Empire|first=Elizabeth|last=Ho|chapter=Chapter 1: Neo-Victorianism and "Ripperature" – Alan Moore's ''From Hell''|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|date=April 2012|isbn=9781441197788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any attempt to change this to "Carlito" or "Carly Colón" will be marked as vandalism.--&gt;, who played Carmen's wrestler brothers; [[Joey Ryan (wrestler)|Joey Ryan]] as a wrestler known as "Mr. Monopoly", and Ryan's real-life wife and wrestler [[Laura James (wrestler)|Laura James]] played his valet, "Crystal"; [[Alex Riley]] played a wrestler known as "Steel Horse"; [[Brooke Hogan]] as night club manager Amber Fredrickson; [[Chavo Guerrero Jr.]] as Chico Guapo; and [[Christopher Daniels]] and [[Frankie Kazarian]] as unnamed wrestlers. [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Ric Flair]], and [[Gorgeous George]] appear in archived video footage in episodes 1 and 4.

==Production==
The idea for the series came when Flahive and Mensch, who at the time were looking to make a new female-centric show, came across the 2012 documentary ''[[GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling]]''.&lt;ref name="RSinthering"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scherer|first1=Jenna|title=Get in the Ring: How 'GLOW' Recreates the Golden Age of Lady-Wrestling TV|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/how-glow-recreates-the-golden-age-of-lady-wrestling-tv-w489354|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Varietyinterview"&gt;{{cite web|last1= Birnbaum|first1=Debra|title=Why 'GLOW' Creators Made Women's Wrestling Series|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/glow-netflix-liz-flahive-carly-mensch-1202476076/|website=Variety|accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, neither woman had heard of the GLOW wrestling promotion, and they became intrigued by the premise of producing a fictionalized version of it.&lt;ref name="Varietyinterview"/&gt; Both women found the storyline intriguing as a way of exploring the aftermath of the 1970s [[Women's liberation movement|Woman's Liberation Movement]], with Flahive telling ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "We wanted to look back on the 1970s, coming out of the women's movement, and into the 1980s, and ask the question: Did it work? Did things get better?"&lt;ref name= "RSinthering"/&gt; To this end, it was important for the series to maintain a tension between whether the league was exploiting women or empowering them.&lt;ref name= "RSinthering"/&gt;

[[Ursula Hayden]], the owner of the GLOW company, served as a consultant on the series and helped Flahive and Mensch with creating the show. Hayden was also on the original 1980s promotion as Babe, the Farmer's Daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/33445-glow-original-wrestlers-netflix-show |title=How the Original G.L.O.W. Wrestlers Helped Shape the Netflix Hit |author=Francisco, Eric |publisher=Inverse |date=June 28, 2017 |accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]] of the famous [[Los Guerreros|Guerrero wrestling family]] also served as a consultant on the series and helped train the actresses. His uncle [[Mando Guerrero]] had served in the same role for the original series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/chavo-guerrero-jr-on-getting-glow-wrestling-right-w489178 |title='GLOW' Fight Coordinator Chavo Guerrero Jr. on Getting Wrestling Right |author=Herzog, Kenny |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |date=June 22, 2017 |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The series was shot on several locations in Los Angeles; mainly in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Chavo's Boxing Gym, which is GLOW's training grounds, was a combination of two locations: the interior was a studio set while the exterior was the rear of the San Fernando Masonic Lodge. The Pink Motel in [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles|Sun Valley]] was used as a stand-in for The Dusty Spur Motel, GLOW's sleeping quarters. Other notable locations include the [[Mayan Theater]] and the [[Hollywood Palladium]].&lt;ref name=locations&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/heres-find-l-locations-saw-glow/ |title=Here's Where to Find All of the L.A.

The series received mixed reactions from some of the original GLOW wrestlers. [[Jeanne Basone]], who wrestled in the promotion as "Hollywood", commented that "Some of the training and the gym and the outfits they get correct."

The '''Great Kurultáj''' or briefly '''Kurultáj''' is a traditional event of peoples of [[Central Asia]]n nomadic origins, which takes place in the first week of August in [[Bugac]], [[Hungary]]. The aim of this event is to strengthen the unity of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Eurasian steppe]]-[[Nomadic pastoralism|nomadic]] horse culture and traditions between [[Hungarians]] and their cultural relatives, eastern Turkic peoples and Altaic peoples. The first Kurultaj was held in the [[Torgai]] region of [[Kazakhstan]] in 2007. The first Kurultaj in Hungary was held in 2008. These events contributed much to the revival of the [[Pan-Turanism|Altaic]] self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Imre Laslotsky, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Hungary to Kazakhstan: [http://e-history.kz/media/upload/1846/2014/07/01/f88b174f8a3314c68ce6d01a974d6eb0.pdf  "Exploring own Origins"], by Daniyar Kassymov. In: International popular scientific historical magazine "Mangilik El: in the stream of History", registered in the Ministry of Culture and Information of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Certificate No.13768-Zh. Page 13. 02.08.2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurultaj is a widely attended event for professional [[Equestrianism|horsemen]] and fans of horse riding. Each Kurultaj holds the parade of horsemen, [[horse race]]s, traditional horsemen wrestling, and various tournaments. Only Hungary, among European nations, has preserved the traditional [[kokpar]] game, a strategic [[team sport]] for riders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deviantart.com/print/36272121/ KURULTAJ – tribal assembly of the Hun – Turkic nations, celebration of the preservation of the ancient traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The word ”kurultaj” and its variations in the [[Turkic languages]] translates as “meeting of the tribes”. It occurs amongst tribal nations and practically in all the nomadic cultures. Hungarian nomadic tribes also held these meetings, a fact that is mentioned in Byzantine and Arab written sources. At such meetings, important decisions were made, in particular, the leaders of the tribes would meet often to discuss military decisions and strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Official website of Kurultáj - [http://kurultaj.hu/english/ "Information: History of Kurultaj"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lilac Flowers of Doom! - 15522077678.jpg|thumb|350px|The jacaranda in the main quadrangle at the [[University of Sydney]] (2014)]]
The '''jacaranda''' was a historically significant specimen of ''[[Jacaranda mimosifolia]]'' tree that stood in the south-eastern corner of the [[University of Sydney]] [[University of Sydney Quadrangle|main quadrangle]], and now describes its clone replanted in the same location. It was first planted in 1928 by Associate Professor [[Eben Gowrie Waterhouse]], and replaced several times in the 1930s. Blooming in late [[Spring (season)|spring]] at the end of the academic year, it became closely associated with examination time at the university. It has formed the background to many events, and the original tree was on the [[City of Sydney]]'s Significant Tree Register. On 28 October 2016, the old tree died after 88 years and fell over. On 20 July 2017, the University announced the replacement of the jacaranda with a genetically identical clone, and a native [[Brachychiton acerifolius|Illawarra flame tree]] in the opposite corner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9 things you should know about the Quad's new residents|url=http://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2017/07/20/nine-things-should-know-about-the-quads-new-residents.html|website=The University of Sydney|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Original tree==
=== Planting ===
The tree was located in the corner of the quadrangle close to where Philosophy classes used to be held. It was planted by [[Eben Gowrie Waterhouse]], who was McCaughey associate professor of German and comparative literature and also a [[camellia]] expert. His interest in [[horticulture]] and landscaping influenced the design of the gardens at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article166573920 |title=Tree Planting and Landscape |newspaper=[[The Newcastle Sun]] |issue=5688 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=6 March 1936 |accessdate=30 October 2016 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is credited with turning the main quadrangle where the jacaranda grew "from an unsightly mess into a dignified area".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/waterhouse-eben-gowrie-8991/text15827|title=Waterhouse, Eben Gowrie (1881–1977)|last=O'Neil|first=W. M.|date=1990|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterhouse continued to be engaged for many years on beautification schemes involving tree planting for the university, in the city beyond the university, as well as in other cities beyond Sydney. In an address given in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in 1936, Waterhouse said that "beautification of urban and suburban areas ranked among the finest forms of community service" and that in tree planting, the preservation of trees and the creative work were both important.&lt;ref name=Newcastle&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article142403516|title=Beauty in Trees|last=|first=|date=10 March 1936|work=[[Newcastle Morning Herald And Miners' Advocate]]|publication-place=|page=5|access-date=31 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he received a gold medal from the [[Royal Horticultural Society]], London.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Stories about the difficulty of establishing the tree circulated for many years. Students were blamed for several failed efforts after young trees were ripped out and frustrated Committee members passed "motions deploring the actions of 'irresponsible vandals'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17481296 |title=Tree Destruction at University|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issue=31,365 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=12 July 1938 |accessdate=31 October 2016 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vandalism concerning the jacaranda was included in newspaper reports as late as 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17591482 |title=Destruction at University |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issue=31,637 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=25 May 1939 |accessdate=31 October 2016 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47976548 |title=News In Brief: Joke Loses its Point |newspaper=[[Barrier Miner]] |volume=LI, |issue=15,240 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=12 July 1938 |accessdate=31 October 2016 |page=1 (Home Edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative view is that staff stole young trees for their own gardens.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Eventually, the planting succeeded and over its life, the jacaranda grew to a width of 18 metres, becoming both "grand" and "iconic".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/university-of-sydney-clones-iconic-quadrangle-jacaranda-tree-20141116-11np06.html|title=University of Sydney clones iconic quadrangle jacaranda tree|last=Phillips|first=Nicky|date=16 November 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=31 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life ===
[[File:Jacaranda carpet, Sydney University.jpg|thumb|right|The flowers of the jacaranda carpeting the lawn (2015)]]

Sydney University's jacaranda formed the backdrop to many public and private events that took place in the quadrangle, including graduations and weddings. In the opinion of [[Mark Scott (businessman)|Mark Scott]], it was "the most famous tree in education".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mscott/status/792193636519649281|title=Vale: the most famous tree in Australian education. Sydney Uni quad's jacaranda.|last=Scott|first=Mark|date=29 October 2016|website=Twitter|publisher=|access-date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's landscape and grounds manager said "I don't think the quadrangle would be the space it is without that tree."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

The tree was well-loved in spite of its association with the examination period in November when jacarandas all over Sydney come into flower. Accepted wisdom was that exam failure was inevitable for a student who had not yet begun to study by the time its purple blooms appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/29/sydney-university-bereft-over-death-of-jacaranda-tree-say-it-isnt-so?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other|title=Sydney University bereft over death of jacaranda tree: 'say it isn't so'|last=Hunt|first=Elle|date=29 October 2016|work=Guardian Australia|access-date=30 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/arts-and-culture/vale-sydney-unis-beloved-jacaranda-tree-bit-the-du/a14dbec9-0cae-4315-af43-36697ca9e61e.htm|title=VALE: Sydney Uni's Beloved Jacaranda Tree Bit The Dust Overnight|last=Hennessy|first=James|date=29 October 2016|work=Pedestrian Daily|access-date=30 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-37819712|title=Australians mourn tree that 'failed' university students|last=Savage|first=Jay|date=31 October 2016|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the jacaranda was added to the list of historic or environmentally significant trees in the City of Sydney as "one of Sydney’s best known significant trees".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/students-past-and-present-mourn-university-of-sydneys-famous-jacaranda-tree-20161029-gsdn6g.html|title=Students past and present mourn University of Sydney's famous jacaranda tree|last=Nguyen|first=Han|date=29 October 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=30 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trees.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/location/university-of-sydney-university-avenue/|title=University of Sydney, University Avenue|last=|first=|date=2013|website=Significant Trees|publisher=City of Sydney|access-date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was known as "a living asset".&lt;ref name=Newcastle/&gt; In 2012, the city's chief [[arborist]] placed it in the Register's Top 10.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The trees on the Register are selected on the basis of their "historical, cultural, social, ecological or outstanding visual and aesthetic appeal".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other varieties of tree on the Register near to the university include [[Ficus macrophylla|Moreton Bay figs]] in Alexandria Park, [[Alexandria, New South Wales|Alexandria]] and [[Observatory Hill, Sydney|Observatory Hill]]; [[Lophostemon confertus|Brush box]] trees in Avenue Road, [[Glebe, Sydney|Glebe]]; [[Washingtonia|Washington palms]] in Farrer Place, Sydney; [[Platanus|Plane trees]] on Bourke Street, Surry Hills; and [[Dracaena draco|Dragon's blood trees]] in [[Cook and Phillip Park Aquatic and Fitness Centre|Cook and Phillip Park]].{{cn|date=November 2016}}

=== Death ===
[[File:Inside Quadrangle Cloisters, University of Sydney.JPG|thumb|View through the jacaranda to a traditional post-graduation ceremony gathering in the Main Quad (2013)]]
In 2016 the tree died after 88 years, possibly of [[ganoderma]] fungus, and fell over on 28 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/what-brought-down-sydney-universitys-jacaranda-tree-20161030-gsdzah.html|title=What brought down Sydney University's jacaranda tree|last=Kembrey|first=Melanie|date=30 October 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=30 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://honisoit.com/2016/10/the-jacaranda-tree-in-the-quad-has-died/|title=The Jacaranda tree in the Quad has died – Honi Soit|website=honisoit.com|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was cut up and removed the following day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The university issued a press release reminding students that the tree had begun to bloom and wished "them all well for their final weeks of study for 2016".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2016/10/29/university-community-mourns-jacaranda-tree-collapse.html|title=University community mourns jacaranda tree collapse|last=|first=|date=29 October 2016|website=University community news|publisher=University of Sydney|access-date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current tree==
===Preparations===
The university had been advised in 2014 that the original tree was nearing the end of its life. Aware of its significance, the university administration had taken [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] and maintained three "emergency" specimens.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://honisoit.com/2014/10/a-botanical-expose/index.html|title=A botanical expose|last=McMahon|first=Ed|date=21 October 2014|newspaper=Honi Soit|language=en-US |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2015-08-06 |accessdate=2016-10-31 |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/146531/20150806-0049/honisoit.com/2014/10/a-botanical-expose/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting clones would subsequently enable it to be replaced with genetically identical stock.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Planting===
In July 2017 the cloned tree was replanted; the tree is a [[grafting|graft]] from the old tree on a jacaranda rootstock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singhal|first1=Pallavi|title=University of Sydney unveils genetically-identical clone of iconic quadrangle jacaranda|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/university-of-sydney-unveils-geneticallyidentical-clone-of-iconic-quadrangle-jacaranda-20170720-gxf45k.html|accessdate=22 July 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university also planted a native [[Brachychiton acerifolius|flame tree]] alongside the replacement jacaranda in recognition of the [[Gadigal|Gadigal people]] on whose traditional lands the university is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/university-of-sydneys-jacaranda-native-tree-will-join-replacement-in-april-2017-20161111-gsn6gn.html|title=University of Sydney's beloved jacaranda to be replaced by April 2017 alongside a new native|last=Cormack|first=Lucy|date=2016-11-11|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Hora Cero''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Zero Hour") was a [[professional wrestling]] major show event produced by [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), which took place on January 11, 2009 in Arena Mexico, [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]]. Six matches took place at La Hora Cero, with the main event being a multi-man [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage]] where the last man in the cage would lose his [[Wrestling mask|mask]]. 13 [[Mini-Estrella]] (the Spanish term for [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] wrestlers) took part in the match; the match ended with [[Shockercito]] and [[Pierrothito]] being the last two men in the cage; Pierrothito subsequently pinned Shockercito to win the match. Following the match Shockercito was unmasked per Lucha Libre traditions. The show also featured four under card matches.

==Background==
The event featured six [[professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[script (recorded media)|scripted]] feuds or [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers portray either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] (referred to as ''Rudos'' in Mexico) or [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]] (''Técnicos'' in Mexico) as they compete in wrestling matches with pre-determined outcomes.

'''La Musica International Chamber Music Festival''' is a [[chamber music]] festival located in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], Florida, United States. Concerts are performed annually in the month of April at the [[Sarasota Opera House]]. 

Founded in 1987 by Artistic Director [[Bruno Giuranna]] (violist), Associate Artistic Director Derek Han (pianist), and Sarasota developer and patron of the arts Piero Rivolta, La Musica has established itself as an artistic and critical success and an outstanding American cultural institution. Its mission is to bring together the finest musicians from around the world to present exciting programs of familiar and seldom-heard chamber music, communicating a joy in performance to enthusiastic audiences. 

In 1992, La Musica moved from performing its concerts in the Historic Asolo Theater to the Sarasota Opera House. Also that year, La Musica was invited to the University of South Florida/New College for rehearsals and lectures, where it remains in residence in Mildred Sainer Pavilion, New College of Florida. Starting in 1994, new festival activities were added: special rehearsals for students, pre-concert lectures, colloquia, and lectures by visiting scholars.

Throughout its history, La Musica has collaborated with other cultural organizations, both national (Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center) and local (Sarasota Film Society, Sarasota Ballet, Ringling College of Art and Design, GuitarSarasota). New works have been commissioned and or premiered (Turchi, Wallach, Bracali, Wyner, Hyman, Winn, Tower, Bilik). Each year since 1998, La Musica has embarked on a thematic excursion, exploring ways in which music relates to other art forms and cultural movements.

In [[physical cosmology]], the '''lepton epoch''' was the period in the evolution of the early universe in which the [[lepton]]s dominated the mass of the universe. It started roughly 1 second after the [[Big Bang]], after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the [[hadron epoch]]. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermal history of the Universe and early growth of density fluctuations|url=http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~gamk/TUM_Lectures/Lecture4.pdf|work=Guinevere Kauffmann|publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]|accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the universe was then dominated by [[photon]]s as it entered the following [[photon epoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First few minutes|work=Eric Chaisson|publisher=Havard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_part3.html|accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of the Big Bang|work=The physics of the Universe|url=http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/topics_bigbang_timeline.html|accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aircraft hijacking]] incidents between the United States and [[Cuba]] were at their height between 1968 and 1972. These incidents have variously been attributed to [[terrorism]], extortion, flight for political asylum, mental illness, and transportation between the two countries as a result of the ongoing antagonistic [[Cuba-United States relations]] and the Communist government restrictions against Cubans attempting to leave Cuba.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.start.umd.edu/publications/lafree_dugan_aerial_hijackings.pdf Testing a rational choice model of airline hijackings] Study of data  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822080601/http://www.start.umd.edu/publications/lafree_dugan_aerial_hijackings.pdf |date=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent measures by both governments contributed to a gradual reduction of reported incidents towards the mid-1970s. Governmental measures included an amendment to [[Cuban law]] which made hijacking a crime in 1970, the introduction of metal detectors in U.S. airports in 1973, and a joint agreement between the U.S. and Cuba signed in Sweden to return or prosecute hijackers.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

Below is a non-comprehensive list of hijacking incidents of aircraft between Cuba and the United States.

'''''Mladina''''' is a [[Slovenia]]n weekly [[left-wing]] [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] [[magazine]]. Since the 1920s, when it was first published,&lt;ref name="imaginarymuseum.org"&gt;[http://imaginarymuseum.org/ETS/ETSeng.html Europe Against The Current 1985–1989&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it has become a voice of protest against those in power. Now it is printed weekly throughout the country and is considered one of the most influential political magazines in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Benderly and Evan Kraft, Independent Slovenia (New York: NY, 1994) 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
''Mladina'' was first founded in 1920 as the official herald of the Youth Section of the [[Yugoslav Communist Party]] in Slovenia. Thus, it was started as a youth magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David H. Weaver|author2=Lars Willnat|title=The Global Journalist in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETE5vVTeLQkC&amp;pg=PA284|accessdate=16 November 2014|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-88576-8|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the prohibition of the Communist Party in 1921, the journal kept circulating in a semi-illegal position. During this period, it was the herald not only of Communists, but of the radical leftist and anti-capitalist youth in general. Famous figures such as the poet [[Srečko Kosovel]], writer [[Ludvik Mrzel]] and historian [[France Klopčič]] published in the magazine. In the 1930s, during the dictatorship of [[King Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], the journal ceased to exist due to the repressive pressure of the authorities. It was re-established during [[World War II]], in January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;http://imaginarymuseum.org/ETS/ETSeng.html&lt;/ref&gt; as the journal of the underground [[anti-Fascist|anti-fascist]] resistance movement. After 1945, it was again transformed in the official herald of the Youth Section of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]].

By 1984, ''Mladina'' was in crisis. A new generation of editors then took charge and transformed the tired party journal into a teenager's [[fanzine]], of which the sales at first rose to a modest 7,000 copies. However, the new image was not just a vehicle to cover pop events, and it soon became a political paper that was the voice of opposition. It gained immediate popularity. Revelations of corruption scandals in Slovenia drove the circulation up to 30,000.&lt;ref name="imaginarymuseum.org"/&gt;

In 1982, the Congress of the [[Alliance of Socialist Youth of Slovenia]] decided to transform ''Mladina'' by increasing its editorial autonomy and elevate it to the voice of the growing internal opposition of the young Communists against the mainstream of the Communist Party in Slovenia. Thus, by the late 1980s ''Mladina'''s main focus became to promote democratic transformation through political criticism. It pursued its change in focus from youth culture to exposing political conflicts within [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] society, including a critique of [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s legacy, the Federal Government, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]] and, especially, the [[Yugoslav People's Army|Army]]. At the time, ''Mladina'' was monitored by the authorities because of its [[pacifist]] stance, manifested, among other things, in its firm opposition to Yugoslavia’s [[arms sales]] to [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="John K Cox 2005"&gt;John K Cox, Slovenia: Evolving Loyalties. (New York: NY, 2005) 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 circulation of ''Mladina'' was 19,300 copies, making it the most read weekly in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martine Robinson Beachboard|author2=John C. Beachboard|title=Implications of Foreign Ownership on Journalistic Quality in a Post-Communist Society: The Case of Finance|journal=Informing Science Journal|date=2006|volume=9|url=http://www.inform.nu/Articles/Vol9/v9p143-162Beachboard83.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ljubljana trial===
''Mladina''{{'}}s most controversial period was the spring of 1988 with the [[JBTZ trial|Ljubljana trial]], also known as the ''Trial against the Four'' (''{{not a typo|Proces}} proti četverici'') or simply as the JBTZ trial, after the initial of the four arrested men (Janša-Borštner-Tasić-Zavrl).&lt;ref&gt;John K Cox, ''Slovenia: Evolving Loyalties''. (New York: NY, 2005)  71&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1984, in fact, four men were arrested and prosecuted for their handling of military documents found at ''Mladina''{{'}}s offices. These documents clarified acts of [[martial law]], to be imposed in Slovenia in an emergency. One of the men arrested was the freelance journalist [[Janez Janša]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John K Cox, Slovenia: Evolving Loyalties. (New York: NY, 2005)  77&lt;/ref&gt; at that time a prominent member of the [[League of Socialist Youth of Slovenia]] who had been expelled from the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]] in 1983 (he later became the [[Prime Minister of Slovenia]]). The others were two editors of the magazine, [[David Tasić]] and [[Franci Zavrl]], and  an army sergeant, Ivan Borštner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The arrest of two of its editors elicited strong protest, pushed the circulation to 70,000 and gave the magazine prominence across Yugoslavia in 1987–1988 at a time of differences between Slovenes and other groups in Yugoslavia. "We are the official press, they the alternative", claimed ''Mladina'' editors proudly and boldly at a congress on alternative youth culture in [[Southern Europe]] in [[Bologna]] in December 1988.&lt;ref name="imaginarymuseum.org"/&gt;

The subsequent trial held in [[Ljubljana]], the capital of Slovenia, was carried out in [[Serbo-Croatian]] rather than [[Slovene language|Slovene]], and this caused much offense to many Slovenes. The trial was a unifying time for Slovenes prior to their [[Ten-Day War|separation from Yugoslavia]] and sparked protests around Ljubljana. Around 15,000 people joined a central Ljubljana protest in June of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Sabrina P Ramet and Danica Fink-Hafner, Democratic Transition in Slovenia. (Texas: Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2006) 31&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Committee for the Protection of Human Rights]] (CPHR) was set up.&lt;ref name="John K Cox 2005"/&gt;

==Other coverage==
''Mladina''{{'}}s deputy editor, [[Ali Žerdin]] has said that the magazine's contributors are not hostile to the government, but just sceptical journalists pushing the government to make better choices.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, "War is Seen Influencing Slovenia's Vote on NATO". ''The New York Times'', 22 March 2003, late ed.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2003, as Slovenia was entering [[NATO]], statements in ''Mladina'' led to accusations that it was anti-NATO. Žerdin defended the magazine by saying that the government would not consider a rebuff in the referendum a vote against NATO.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, "War is Seen Influencing Slovenia's Vote on NATO", ''The New York Times'', 22 March 2003, late ed&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion is also a frequent topic in ''Mladina''. The magazine has been critical of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], such as its opposition to the rehabilitation of [[Gregorij Rožman]],&lt;ref&gt;An article entitled ''Opravičilo kolaboracije'' (Justifying collaboration) following the decision of the Slovenian Supreme Court to overturn Rožman's conviction for collaboration: http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200742/clanek/slo-tema--borut_mekina/&lt;/ref&gt; and has opposed the policies of the Slovenian cardinal [[Franc Rode]], the [[Opus Dei]] and other conservative currents in the Church. It has also been accused of inciting [[anti-Catholic]] sentiment, most famously by the writer and essayist [[Drago Jančar]] in his essay "Slovenian Marginalities", published in 1999. In 2004, a controversy on whether or not [[Muslims]] should be allowed to build a mosque in Ljubljana broke out.&lt;ref name=slo&gt;Slovoj Zizek, “Defenders of the Faith,” ''New York Times'' 12 March 2006, late ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Slovenia's Muslims are first or second generation descendants of immigrant workers from other former Yugoslav regions (mostly [[Bosniaks]] and [[Albanians]]) and several [[chauvinist]] and right-wing groups have opposed the building of a mosque in Ljubljana, while ''Mladina'' fully supports its construction. However, in line with its [[Liberalism|liberal]] stance, ''Mladina'' was one of the few printed media in Slovenia that published the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|controversial cartoons of Mohammad]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=slo/&gt;

''Mladina'' has had several prominent dedicated professionals. [[Ivo Standeker]] was a feature editor for ''Mladina'' working in [[Sarajevo]] when he was killed in June 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Rumeni Internet – Slovenia. Mladina Magazine, Slovenia. What is Mladina Magazine. 2007 20 September 2007 &lt;http://yellow.eunet.si/yellowpage/0/mediji1/mladina/mladina.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famous contributors ==
Several famous people have collaborated with the magazine during its history. They include: sociologist and musician [[Gregor Tomc]], journalist and politician [[Janez Janša]], philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]], philosopher and literary theorist [[Rastko Močnik]], political theorist [[Tomaž Mastnak]] and [[Vlasta Jalušič]], journalist [[Jurij Gustinčič]], sociologist and publicist [[Bernard Nežmah]], film critic [[Marcel Štefančič Jr.]], jurist and human rights activist [[Matevž Krivic]], cartoonist [[Tomaž Lavrič]], and many others.

The '''Newport Folk Festival''' is an [[Music of the United States|American]] annual [[folk music|folk]]-oriented [[music festival]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], which began in July 1959 as a counterpart to the previously established [[Newport Jazz Festival]]. The festival is often considered one of the first modern music festivals in America and remains a focal point in the ever-expanding genre of "folk" music.

==History==
===Founding===
The Newport Folk Festival was founded in 1959 by [[George Wein]], founder of the already-well-established Newport Jazz Festival, and owner of [[Storyville (nightclub)|Storyville]], a jazz club located in Boston, MA. In 1958, Wein became aware of the growing [[American folk music revival|Folk Revival movement]] and began inviting folk artists such as [[Odetta]] to perform on Sunday afternoons at Storyville. The afternoon performances consistently sold out and Wein began to consider the possibility of a "folk afternoon embedded within the 1959 Newport Jazz Festival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wein|first1=George|title=Myself Among Others: A Life In Music|date=April 14, 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press; Paperback Edition edition|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wein envisioned the program to be "similar in scope and tone to the highly successful blues and gospel shows" that had taken place at the Jazz Festival in previous years. Wein asked Odetta, [[Pete Seeger]], and [[the Weavers]] to perform on the afternoon in addition to [[the Kingston Trio]].  After conferring with the folk community, it grew abundantly clear to Wein that an afternoon program would not suffice and that there was demand for a full festival.

Aware of his own limitations in the folk scene, Wein asked [[Albert Grossman]], then Odetta's manager, to join him in planning and producing the festival. Grossman accepted and began working with Wein to book talent and organize the weekend.

The inaugural festival lineup included [[Pete Seeger]], [[Earl Scruggs]], the Kingston Trio, John Jacob Niles, [[Sonny Terry]] and Brownie McGhee, Odetta, The [[New Lost City Ramblers]], and more. Perhaps the most notable performance was the surprise debut of the eighteen year old [[Joan Baez]], who was brought on as a guest of [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1wxBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77 |title= Popular Is Not Enough: The Political Voice Of Joan Baez: A Case Study in the Biographical Method|first= Markus |last=Jaeger |pages= 77–78 |publisher=Ibidem Press |year=2010 |isbn=9783838261065 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival returned in 1960 and was expanded to include three nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wein|first1=George|title=Myself Among Others: A Life In Music|date=April 14, 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press; Paperback Edition edition|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lineup placed an emphasis on music diversity, booking performers from Africa, Scotland, Spain, Israel, and Ireland alongside "traditional" folk musicians such as Pete Seeger, [[Ewan McColl]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Cisco Houston]] and [[Tommy Makem]].

===Civil Rights Movement===
In 1962, two young members of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) formed a gospel vocal quartet named the [[Freedom Singers]]. And in 1962, Pete and [[Toshi Seeger]] assisted the Freedom Singers in organizing a nationwide collegiate tour. As a result, the civil rights movement became deeply embraced by the folk music community. In 1963, the Freedom Singers performed on the first night of the Newport Folk festival, and on the second night Joan Baez joined SNCC activists and roughly 600 festival-goers on a march through Newport. The crowd walked past the Bellevue Avenue mansions and into Touro Park, where SNCC's executive secretary [[James Forman]] and Freedom Singers leader [[Cordell Reagon]] delivered speeches, rallying support for the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] scheduled for the following March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wein|first1=George|title=Myself Among Others: A Life In Music|date=April 14, 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press; Paperback Edition edition|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the final performance on Friday Wein had scheduled [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]. But under the persuasion of Albert Grossman, who was managing Peter, Paul and Mary, Wein decided to allow [[Bob Dylan]] (whom Grossman was also managing) to close the night. After Peter, Paul and Mary finished their afternoon set, Wein announced that they would reappear at the end of the evening. Dylan performed a set consisting of particularly topical songs: "With God on Our Side", "Talkin' John Birch Society Blues", and "A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall". Peter, Paul and Mary then returned and performed an encore of "Blowin' in the Wind". Amidst a "deafening roar of applause"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wein|first1=George|title=Myself Among Others: A Life In Music|date=April 14, 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press; Paperback Edition edition|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; they brought to the stage Dylan, Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, [[Theo Bikel]] and the Freedom Singers. The singers stood in a single line facing the audience with crossed arms and clasped hands and began to sing a variation on the Baptist hymn "I'll Overcome Some Day". The hymn's new incarnation - "[[We Shall Overcome]]" - had become an anthem for the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wein|first1=George|title=Myself Among Others: A Life In Music|date=April 14, 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press; Paperback Edition edition|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival of Mississippi John Hurt===
In 1928, [[Mississippi John Hurt]], a self-taught amateur musician and farmer, recorded 13 songs for Okeh Records which failed to achieve commercial success. Believing his musical career to be over, Hurt continued farming, apparently thinking little of his brief recording gig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Tony|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray.|publisher=Dubai: Carlton Books.|isbn=1-85868-255-X|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post WWII, few records cut by southern musicians in the 1920s were commercially available. Hurt's records were particularly rare, since few had been manufactured in the first place. But Harry Smith, a member of a tiny subculture of obsessive, cranky collectors, put two John Hurt cuts on his influential 1952 Anthology of American Folk Music, prompting many blues hobbyists to begin searching for him. In 1963, Tom Hoskins and Mike Stewart acquired a tape of Hurt's Avalon Blues through their informal network of tape traders. Hurt had recorded Avalon Blues at the end of a week-long stay in New York that spanned Christmas 1928. Apparently homesick in the big city, Hurt included a line about his home in Avalon being always on his mind.

Hoskins and Stewart were able to locate Avalon and track Hurt down. After asking Hurt to perform, to ensure he was actually who he claimed to be, Hoskins convinced Hurt to move to Washington D.C. and embark on a national tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Tony|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray.|publisher=Dubai: Carlton Books.|isbn=1-85868-255-X|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour culminated on Saturday evening of the 1963 Newport Folk Festival, when Mississippi John Hurt performed alongside Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry and [[John Lee Hooker]] for a blues workshop at the Newport Casino. The performance is considered to be a seminal moment for the folk revival and caused Hurt to rise to fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Tony|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray.|publisher=Dubai: Carlton Books.|isbn=1-85868-255-X|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed extensively at colleges, concert halls, and coffeehouses and appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

===The Electric Dylan controversy===
{{Main|Electric Dylan controversy}}
Bob Dylan's 1963 and 1964 performances solo and with Baez had made him popular with the Newport crowd, but on July 25, 1965 festival headliner Dylan was booed by some fans when he played with backing band The Paul Butterfield Blues Band.

It is usually said that the reason for the hostile reception by a small number of fans was Dylan's "abandoning of the folk [[orthodoxy]], or poor sound quality on the night (or a combination of the two). The controversy regarding the reaction of the audience at this event is often overplayed, as it was not the general reaction of the audience, but rather that of a small number of folk "purists", including Pete Seeger. The reaction of "the crowd" to Dylan's performance, certainly from eyewitness accounts, was generally quite enthusiastic. This performance, Dylan's first live "plugged-in" set of his professional career, marked the shift in his artistic direction from folk to rock, and had wider implications for both genres. The performance marked the first time Dylan performed "Like a Rolling Stone" in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wald |first=Elijah |date=2015 |title=Dylan Goes Electric! |url=https://www.amazon.com/Dylan-Goes-Electric-Newport-Sixties/dp/0062366696 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Harper Collins |page=260 |isbn=0062366696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the musical transition, Dylan's growing status within the larger [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] ensured that his place in the expanding movement would remain secure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/arts/music-when-dylan-s-genius-burned-brightest.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan did not return to Newport until 2002, when he played a headlining performance while wearing a wig and fake beard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Boucher |first1=Geoff |title=Dylan's Disguise Keeps Fans Guessing at Newport Festival |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/07/entertainment/et-boucher7 |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=26 October 2018 |date=7 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johnny Cash Introduces Kris Kristofferson===
In 1969, the [[Johnny Cash]] troupe was to perform on opening night of the festival. Cash had recently become aware of [[Kris Kristofferson]], a young, relatively unknown country singer-songwriter, and convinced George Wein to allow Kristofferson to join him onstage. Kristofferson's performance of "Me and Bobby McGee" and other songs gave him a launch into his legendary musical career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helander |first=Brock |date=2002 |title=The Rockin' 60s: The People Who Made the Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mbHDgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=johnny+cash+introduces+kris+kristofferson+newport+folk&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |location=New York, NY |publisher=Schirmer Trade Books |page=103 |isbn=0062366696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michelle Shocked V-J Day Protest===
The Newport Folk Festival has, throughout various points in its history, remained connected to protest movements. In the 60's the festival played a substantial part in the civil rights movement. In the early 80's the Newport Folk Festival was one of the first festivals to serve as a platform for climate change protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massimo|first1=Rick|title=I got a song|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the 1990s, playing on [[Victory Day (United States)|Victory Day]] (originally "[[Victory over Japan Day]]" or "V-J Day") folk musician [[Michelle Shocked]] asked the entire audience to lie down because "she wanted to see what it looked like when people had been destroyed by bombs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massimo|first1=Rick|title=I got a song|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was relevant to the locale of the festival as Rhode Island is the only US state which still officially celebrates the holiday, and the [[Naval War College]] is also in Newport, a mere few miles from the [[Fort Adams State Park]] where the festival is held.

===Return of Bob Dylan===
In 2002, Bob Dylan returned to the Newport Folk Festival for the first time since his shocking performance in 1965, in which he went electric. The '65 appearance at the Folk Festival was a turning point in his career, a distancing of himself from his acoustic folk music to his more blues-based electric music.

Despite wide speculation that Dylan would once again attempt to "shock" the audience at Newport, Dylan performed a straightforward set, with little surprises. The performance was reviewed favorably and provided a much needed economic boost to the festival. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piazza|first1=Tom|title=Bob Dylan's Unswerving Road Back To Newport
|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/arts/bob-dylan-s-unswerving-road-back-to-newport.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pixies Go Acoustic===
Initially spanning the late eighties and early nineties, [[The Pixies]] are often credited for creating a blueprint for alternative rock that was followed and embellished upon by numerous contemporary indie/rock artists. After separating in 1994, the group reunited in 2004 and in 2005, performed, for the first time, a completely acoustic performance at the Newport Folk Festival. The set was deemed "Pixies Go Acoustic" as a play on words in reference to Bob Dylan going electric at the Newport Folk Festival is 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borofsky|first1=Michael|title=Pixies: Acoustic: Live in Newport|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pixies-Acoustic-Live-Newport/dp/B000GW8RWU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance was recorded and turned into a feature film directed by Michael B Borofsky, titled Pixies: Acoustic: Live in Newport.

===Establishment of Foundation===

The Newport Folk Festival has existed in various forms since its creation; founded as a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]], the festival became a [[Business|for-profit]] in the mid-eighties. However, in 2011, the festival announced it would return to its non-profit status under the umbrella of the Newport Festivals Foundation. The Foundation not only strived to sustain the Newport Folk and Newport Jazz Festival, but also expand the impact of its Festivals through educational initiatives that celebrate innovation while preserving the deep traditions inherent in Jazz and Folk music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newportfestivals.org/  Newport Festivals Foundation], retrieved January 10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turning Point/50th Celebration===
In 2008, Executive Producer, George Wein hired Jay Sweet as an associate of the festival. At the time, the folk festival was struggling financially and with Sweet's recommendations, the 2008 line-up varied drastically from previous years. Rock band the Black Crowes and Trey Anastasio, frontman of Phish, headlined and other artists on the bill included Stephen Marley and Damian Marley, sons of reggae icon Bob Marley. The Festival was well attended and received favorable press, despite folk purists questioning the modernization of the festival.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massimo|first1=Rick|title=I got a song|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sweet continued his unconventional and somewhat controversial style of booking artists that challenged the conservative definitions of folk music. With 2009 being the 50th anniversary of the festival, Sweet used the opportunity to book both modern and traditional folk acts; symbolizing the past and current styles of folk music. The success of the 2009 festival marked a turning point in the festival's history. In 2011 the two day festival sold out Saturday and in 2012 the festival sold out both days. In 2013 the festival expanded to three days and sold out both Saturday and Sunday. In 2014 the festival sold out all three days months in advance. The festival has sold out every year since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massimo|first1=Rick|title=I got a song|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===65 Revisited===
In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Bob Dylan going electric at Newport, the Festival scheduled a program titled 65 Revisited on the final night of the 2015 festival. The program's details and performers were kept secret prior to the performance - prompting various rumors including the return of Bob Dylan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Randy|title=Bob Dylan's 1965 electric set at Newport Folk Festival revisited|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-bob-dylan-newport-folk-festival-electric-guitar-65-revisited-20150728-story.html|website=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the program featured an array of more contemporary musicians, including Taylor Goldsmith of [[Dawes (band)|Dawes]], [[Gillian Welch]] and [[David Rawlings]], [[Willie Watson (musician)|Willie Watson]], [[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]] and Klara Soderberg of First Aid Kit, John McCauley and Ian O'Neil of [[Deer Tick (band)|Deer Tick]], Robyn Hitchcock and the [[Preservation Hall Jazz Band]] of New Orleans. The ensemble performed a collection of Dylan's material, ending the performance with "Rainy Day Women #12 and 35,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Andy|title=Concert Review: At Newport Folk Festival, a tribute to Bob Dylan|url=http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20150726/NEWS/150729442|website=www.providencejournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming Style==
In recent years, the Newport Folk Festival has developed a reputation for selling out of tickets before announcing the lineup. Unlike most festivals, the festival "rolls out" their lineup over the course of the year instead of releasing a lineup poster on one day. 
The festival has also developed a reputation for programming surprise, unannounced artists. Past instances include the 65 Revisited program (2015), in which Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, Dawes, and Willie Watson appeared unannounced. Other surprise moments include [[My Morning Jacket]] (2015), [[James Taylor]] (2015), [[Kris Kristofferson]] (2016), [[Roger Waters]] (2017), and [[Mumford &amp; Sons]] (2018).  Like 65 Revisited in 2015, 2018's A Change Is Gonna Come closing set paired guests from the weekend with unannounced guests including [[Leon Bridges]], [[Chris Thile]], and [[Mavis Staples]]&lt;ref&gt;Providence Journal. July 29, 2018 [http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180729/review-songs-of-change-as-newport-folk-festival-concludes Review Songs of Change As Newport Folk Festival Concludes]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Setting==
The Newport Folk Festival takes place every year at [[Fort Adams State Park]], in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. 
Fort Adams houses four stages, the Fort Stage which sits looking out at Newport harbor and the famous [[Claiborne Pell Bridge]], the Harbor Stage, The Quad Stage, and The Museum Stage. The festival is known for its beautiful setting- as the music blog [[Consequence of Sound]] puts it, "Located at the gorgeously scenic Fort Adams, in Newport, Rhode Island, glimmering, clear blue water surrounds the small vivid green peninsula. Look out from the fort towers and you'll see hundreds of beautiful boats rocking along the water." ([http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/08/04/chillin-the-folk-out-cos-at-newport-folk-fest-10/ Consequence of Sound]).
[[My Morning Jacket]] frontman [[Jim James]] told [[Spin Magazine]], "You've got the sun on your skin and the breeze in your hair. It's magical here... It's just magical." ([https://www.spin.com/2010/08/8-best-moments-newport-folk-fest/ SPIN at Newport Folk 2010]) Brandi Carlile says "It's one of my favorites so far if not my favorite." ([http://www.allthingsnewengland.com/new-england-arts-and-entertainment/music-articles-reviews-and-interviews/264-brandi-carlile-interview.html Brandi Carlile Interview])

[[WMVY]] began streaming the festival in 2005 and was joined by [[NPR Music]] in 2008. WMVY's [http://www.mvyradio.com/archives/ Archives] contains both performances and interviews from Newport Folk and NPR music has recorded sets available for listening here: [http://ww.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128957393 NPR at Newport Folk 2010].

==Sustainability==
The festival has made efforts in being green-friendly, teaming with many groups to do so.
They partnered with [[Clean Water Action]] and Rhode Island Resource Recovery to collect 1.5 tons of recyclables. CWA worked onsite picking up trash and recycling, and set up composting stations to curb the waste generated during the event. A portion of beer and wine sales went to CWA to support their work.
The official beer of the festival, [[Vermont]]-based [[Magic Hat Brewing Company|Magic Hat]] used plant-based, 100% compostable cups.
The festival also partnered with CLIF Bar, who set up a bike valet to encourage people to cycle to the event and participate in their 2-Mile Challenge.
They worked with New England Wind Fund to offset power used during the festival, and Klean Kanteen to provide reusable water bottles.
They also partnered with Farm Fresh Rhode Island to incorporate local foods into the vendors' fare.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3768">The '''[[Philadelphian cricket team]]''' made a '''tour of [[Jamaica]] in February 1909'''. The Philadelphians played 3 [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches against the [[Jamaica national cricket team|Jamaicans]] winning two and losing one.&lt;ref name='CricketArchive1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/WI/1908-09_WI_Philadelphians_in_Jamaica_1908-09.html |title=Philadelphians in Jamaica 1908/09 |accessdate=2007-05-17 |date=2003–2007 |publisher=CricketArchive }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the last first-class tours for the Philadelphian team. The city of Philadelphia was nearing the end of its golden age and the last first-class game for the team would be played only three years later. 

The series began at [[Sabina Park]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] on 15 February with a two-day match. In spite of a solid first [[innings]] batting performance from [[William Newhall]], the visitors only managed 93 runs. The Jamaican side needed only 12 runs in their second innings to win the match by nine [[wicket]]s.&lt;ref name='CricketArchive2'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7773.html |title=Jamaica v Philadelphians in 1908/09 |accessdate=2007-05-17 |date=2003–2007 |publisher=CricketArchive }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Morrison (cricketer)|Charles Morrison]] did most of the damage for Jamaica taking 11-78 in the match.

On 17 February, the series continued at [[Kensington Park, Kingston]]. The Philadelphians won the [[toss (cricket)|toss]] and decided to bat first. Behind an 86 from [[Ireland|Irish]] transplant [[James McDonogh]], the visitors made 183 runs in their first innings. This was followed by a 150 from Jamaica. In their second innings, the Americans scored 223. [[Ranji Hordern]] bowled very well taking 8 wickets in each innings and helping to hold the home side to only 84 runs in their second innings. The Philadelphians took the match by 172.&lt;ref name='CricketArchive3'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7774.html |title=Jamaica v Philadelphians in 1908/09 |accessdate=2007-05-17 |date=2003–2007 |publisher=CricketArchive }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this match [[Malcolm Kerr (cricketer)|Malcolm Kerr]] "staggered humanity by taking 6-30 in an innings, 9 for 100 in the match, against the Philadelphians, having scarcely been considered a bowler at all before",&lt;ref&gt;Cricket - A Weekly Record of the Game, 1913 page 83&lt;/ref&gt; his very last match for Jamaica.

The series concluded with another 2 day match on 19 February at [[Melbourne Park, Kingston]]. Again the Philadelphians won the toss and decided to go to bat first. [[Reggie Conyers]], originally from [[Bermuda]] opened the batting with a 149 before being bowled. His side finished the first innings with 252 runs. The Jamaicans followed-on after making only 110 runs in their first innings. The Americans needed only 38 runs in their second innings to win the match by 8 wickets. Ranji Hordern again dominated the Philadelphian's bowling taking 13 for 113 in the match. Over the course of the series, Hordern took 34 wickets.&lt;ref name='CricketArchive4'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7777.html |title=Jamaica v Philadelphians in 1908/09 |accessdate=2007-05-17 |date=2003–2007 |publisher=CricketArchive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3575">'''The recession index''' (''the R-word index'') is an informal [[Index (economics)|index]] created by [[The Economist]] which counts how many stories in the [[Washington Post]] and the [[New York Times]] using the word “[[recession]]” in a [[fiscal quarter|quarter]].

This simple formula pinpointed the start of [[Recession#History_of_recessions|recessions in 1981, 1990, and 2001]], but was misleading in the early 1990s, when the index indicated a recession for a year after it had officially ended in March 1991.

The index has inspired serious research into testing whether the tone and volume of economic reporting over time has affected people's perceptions. [[Mark Doms]] ([[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco]]) and [[Norman Morin]] (Board of Governors of [[Federal Reserve System|the Federal Reserve]] System) (2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"'''Royal Pudding'''" is the third episode of the [[South Park (season 15)|fifteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'' and 212th episode of the series over all. "Royal Pudding" premiered in the [[United States]] on [[Comedy Central]] on May 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/episodes/s15e03-royal-pudding "Royal Pudding"], South Park Studios, accessed June 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, which parodies the 2011 [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/may/11/south-park-royal-wedding|title=South Park takes on the royal wedding|date=11 May 2011|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Prince of Canada's bride is abducted at the altar, leading [[Ike Broflovski]] to answer the call to rescue her. "Royal Pudding" was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and was rated [[TV-MA]] L in the United States. The episode aired twelve days after the wedding.

==Plot==
[[Mr. Mackey]] is making the kindergarten students perform a play about [[tooth decay]] and the importance of [[dental hygiene]]. He is furious when [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], who is supposed to portray tooth decay, misses a rehearsal to watch the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[List of royal weddings|royal wedding]]. During the ceremony, the princess is suddenly enclosed in a giant [[cube]] and spirited away. Ike is so distraught that he cannot stop crying during rehearsal and gets sent home by Mr. Mackey. People all over Canada [[suicide|kill themselves]] out of despair for the princess' abduction and a [[candlelight vigil]] is held where [[Rush (band)|Rush]] performs a version of ''[[Candle in the Wind]]''. The [[Prime Minister of Canada]] instructs all people of Canadian descent to go home and open their "Box of Faith", which contains – along with a [[Emergency locator beacon|location beacon]], a [[first aid kit]], and a [[sandwich]] – a video recording issuing a call to arms for all Canadians in fighting condition to "meet by the tree in [[Edmonton]]". Ike answers the call and, while riding a bus to Canada, meets a fellow Canadian named [[Ugly Bob]], who claims he has to wear a bag over his head because, even though he simply appears Canadian to Americans, other Canadians find his face frighteningly ugly.

Once the pair arrive, the first instinct of the member of the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Armed Forces]] leading the gathered Canadians is that the princess was taken by a giant, who turns out to be [[Scott the Dick]], who grew to seven feet tall – giant by Canadian standards – after a radioactive accident in [[Ottawa]]. When it turns out that Scott has been wrongly accused of taking the princess, most other Canadians go home, but Scott persuades Ike and Ugly Bob to follow him as he accuses the [[Inuit]] of kidnapping the princess out of his racial prejudice towards the "Native Canadians". The three of them travel to the [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] of northern Canada to get information from the Inuit, who admit that their people do have a grudge against the Canadians for taking their land, but tribe leader reveals that the princess' abduction was foretold, and that the true kidnapper is one who attacks people of all nationalities. With an Inuit mother leading the three, they find a large dark castle, where the princess is held captive by the abductor: Tooth Decay. Eventually, after the monster hurls Scott and the Inuit woman across the room, Ike [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|turns Tooth Decay to stone]] by exposing Ugly Bob's face to him.

Meanwhile, Mr. Mackey becomes increasingly irate with Ike's absence and blames it on [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], who fills Ike's role in the play. During rehearsals Mackey consistently loses his temper with the children for singing flat or without feeling, directing his most scathing remarks at Kyle, and reveals that the play means a great deal to him because Tooth Decay killed his father. While the play is a success with parents of the kindergartners, Mr. Mackey verbally abuses his actors' imperfections backstage until the police intervene, telling Mackey to cancel the play due to reports coming in from the [[Yukon]] that Tooth Decay is dead. Ike receives a [[knight|knighthood]] from the Canadian princess, an honor that fails to impress any of the boys (with the exception of Kyle), and the royal wedding begins again. Both events (before and after the princess' abduction) involve bizarre traditions such as the prince putting his arms into a large bowl of [[butterscotch]] pudding, the princess scraping them clean and smearing the pudding on her own face, and the prince tearing one of her arms off and inserting it into his anus, "as is tradition."

==Production==
According to the DVD commentary, series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker found both the royal wedding and the hype surrounding it to be peculiar, stating, "Whenever we talk about something no one cares about we make it about Canada." The kindergarten play rehearsals were based on the rehearsals for the ''[[Book of Mormon (musical)|Book of Mormon]].'' The voices for the "native Canadians" were provided by Native Americans.&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker]], [[Matt Stone]] | date=March 2012 |title=South Park: The Complete Fifteenth Season: "Royal Pudding" ''(Audio commentary)'' |medium=DVD | url=http://southpark.cc.com/clips/70n0mt/creator-commentary-royal-pudding |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast on May 11, 2011, "Royal Pudding" was seen by 2.435 million viewers, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Bill|title=Wednesday Cable Ratings: NBA Playoffs, 'South Park,' 'Real World' Top Cable + 'Mythbusters,' 'Top Chef' &amp; More|work=TV by the Numbers|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/05/12/wednesday-cable-ratings-nba-playoffs-south-park-real-world-top-cable-mythbusters-top-chef-more/92355/|date=May 13, 2011|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The A.V. Club]] gave the episode a C-, citing its "bric-a-brac construction", and called it "one of the strangest half-hours in the show's history". It was deemed "pointedly silly", "polarizing", and hence "bound to be divisive".&lt;ref name="AVclub"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|title=Royal Pudding|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/royal-pudding,55907/|publisher=The A.V.

[[IGN]] said  "It has been said that episodes without Cartman are often the worst, and that's certainly the case here," giving the episode a 5.5/10.&lt;ref name="IGN.TV"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/116/1167762p1.html|title=South Park: "Royal Pudding" Review|date=12 May 2011|publisher=IGN.TV|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seven Gates of Hell''' is a modern urban legend regarding locations in [[York County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Downingtown Gates of Hell|url=http://www.weirdus.com/states/pennsylvania/local_legends/seven_gates_of_hell/|publisher=Weird US|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two versions of the legend exist, one involving a burnt [[insane asylum]] and the other an eccentric doctor. Both agree that there are seven gates in a wooded area of [[Hellam Township, Pennsylvania]], and that anyone who passes through all seven goes straight to Hell. The location in question never housed an institution; the aforementioned doctor only constructed one gate, to keep out trespassers. '''Note:''' this is private land subjecting visitors to trespassing charges.

==Myth==
There are two popular versions of the myth, with numerous variants of each. One states that a mental institution used to be located on either Toad Road or Trout Run Road, depending on the source, in [[Hellam Township, Pennsylvania]]. It was erected in a remote location so as to isolate people deemed insane from the rest of the world. One day in the 1900s, a fire broke out and, due to its remoteness, firefighters could not reach the hospital in time to save it. Many patients died in the flames, while others escaped and were soon beaten to death.&lt;ref name=PennDOT&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Argento|title=The road to hell paved by PennDOT|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=NewsBank&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=10C059DF0A6ACF20&amp;p_docnum=4&amp;p_queryname=8|work=[[York Daily Record]]|publisher=[[NewsBank]]|date=August 15, 2005|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gates' role in the story is disputed. Some say that the gates were put up by the local search party to trap the remaining inmates.&lt;ref name=PennDOT/&gt; Others say that, completely unrelated to the asylum story, an eccentric physician who lived on the property built several gates along a path deep into the forest.&lt;ref name=Hellam&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven Gates of Hell|url=http://www.hellamtownship.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B815447CA-49FB-4346-84E6-75D01939B2DF%7D|work=[[Hellam Township, Pennsylvania|Hellam Township]]|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both accounts agree on only one gate being visible during the day, but the other six can be seen at night. According to the legend, no one has ever passed the fifth gate, but if they passed all seven, they would go directly to [[Hell]].&lt;ref name=PennDOT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nesbitt|first=Mark|title=The Big Book of Pennsylvania Ghost Stories|year=2008|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=0811703649|pages=137-138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edvc6mUjj_UC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=%22Seven+Gates+of+Hell%22+york&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MT5_UtOFFJHKsQTNr4HIDQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Seven%20Gates%20of%20Hell%22%20york&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reality==
In reality, there is no road called "Toad Road" in Hellam Township, but there is one named Trout Run Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Trout+Run+Rd,+York,+PA+17406&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;split=0&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=XTGTStmfDo61lAfQoIGYDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1
|title=Map of Trout Run Road, Hellam Township, PA  17406|cartography=[[Navteq]]|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no asylum on Trout Run Road, and the local doctor only put up one gate to keep out trespassers. A related myth states that Hellam was named after Hell; this is untrue as well as it is a corruption of Hallam, after [[Hallamshire]], England. The area purported to be the location of the seven gates is on private property and trespassers can be prosecuted.&lt;ref name=Hellam/&gt;

==Notoriety==
The Seven Gates of Hell have received a fair amount of attention. [[Mike Argento]] wrote about it in the ''[[York Daily Record]]'', and Matt Lake featured a section on the gates in his book, ''Weird Pennsylvania''.&lt;ref name=PennDOT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Lake, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bfaultPxl18C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Weird+Pennsylvania%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TxkZ8sBZe8&amp;sig=p49NLjNgGZBZoiMfNIIUw2X6kEY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OGyITOzTONO74gbevPHjAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hell&amp;f=false Weird Pennsylvania: Your Travel Guide to Pennsylvania's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets], Sterling Publishing, 2009, {{ISBN|1-4027-6686-6}};  p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Hellam Township published a page debunking the myths.&lt;ref name=Hellam/&gt; Local resident Cheryl Englar reported a number of tourists searching for the gates, some harassing her and giving her cause to call the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Argento|title=Backyard hell not fun for residents|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/ydr/access/975579091.html?dids=975579091:975579091&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+22%2C+2005&amp;author=MIKE+ARGENTO&amp;pub=York+Daily+Record&amp;desc=Backyard+hell'+not+fun+for+residents&amp;pqatl=google|work=[[York Daily Record]]|publisher=[[ProQuest Archiver]]|date=September 22, 2005|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==In media==
''[[Toad Road]]'', a [[2012 in film|2012]] [[independent film|independent]] [[psychological horror|psychological]] [[horror film]], makes use of the legend.

The '''South Pacific Touring Car Championship''' was a motorsport championship staged in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] for [[Group A]] [[Touring car racing|touring cars]] between October and December in 1986. The championship was won by Australian driver [[Allan Grice]].

Unfortunately, the series received little support from the top teams, especially the Australians other than for the first two rounds held in Australia, while all bar a couple of the New Zealand teams only contested NZ races. Once the series went to New Zealand, Grice and [[Charlie O'Brien (racing driver)|Charlie O'Brien]] were in fact the only Australian drivers to support the series while those such as [[Gibson Motorsport|Peter Jackson Nissan]], [[JPS Team BMW]] and the [[Mobil Holden Dealer Team]] completely ignored the NZ races.

The series was reportedly set to continue in 1987, however after the first race in [[Adelaide]], interest flagged as the Australian teams were not interested in going to New Zealand after a long season which included the [[1987 World Touring Car Championship]] rounds at [[1987 James Hardie 1000|Bathurst]], [[1987 Bob Jane T-Marts 500|Calder]] and [[1987 Wellington 500|Wellington]] and the series was cancelled.

'''Starvation''' is a severe deficiency in caloric [[food energy|energy]] intake, below the level needed to maintain an organism's life. It is the most extreme form of [[malnutrition]]. In humans, prolonged starvation can cause permanent [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] damage&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro8IaMhVvtAC&amp;pg=PA115 Disease-Related Malnutrition: An Evidence-Based Approach to Treatment] "When [food] intake is poor or absent for a long time (weeks), weight loss is associated with organ failure and death."&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually, [[death]]. The term '''''inanition''''' refers to the symptoms and effects of starvation. Starvation may also be used as a means of [[torture]] or [[execution]].

According to the [[World Health Organization]], [[hunger]] is the single gravest threat to the world's public health.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10566634 Malnutrition] The Starvelings&lt;/ref&gt; The [[WHO]] also states that malnutrition is by far the biggest contributor to [[child mortality]], present in half of all cases.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; Undernutrition is a contributory factor in the death of 3.1 million children under five every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats | work=World Food Programme | title=Hunger Stats }}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures on actual starvation are difficult to come by, but according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], the less severe condition of undernourishment currently affects about 842 million people, or about one in eight (12.5%) people in the [[world population]].&lt;ref&gt;FAO: [http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/ The State of Food Insecurity in the World]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bloated stomach represents a form of malnutrition called [[kwashiorkor]] which is caused by insufficient protein despite a sufficient caloric intake.&lt;ref name="bettermedicine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bettermedicine.com/article/kwashiorkor |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002003030/http://www.bettermedicine.com/article/kwashiorkor |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Better medicine will prevent the pictured symptoms in which included is weight loss and [[muscle]] wasting from further taking form.&lt;ref name="bettermedicine" /&gt;

==Common causes== 
Causes of hunger are related to poverty. There are inter-related issues causing hunger, which are related to economics and other factors that cause poverty. They include land rights and ownership, diversion of land use to non productive use, increasing emphasis on export oriented agriculture, inefficient agricultural practices, war, famine, drought, over fishing, poor crop yield, etc.
[[File:Starved Vietnamese man, 1966.JPEG|thumb|upright|Starved [[Vietnam]]ese man, who was deprived of food in a [[Viet Cong]] prison camp. Note the [[rib cage]] showing, a clear sign of starvation.]]
The basic cause of starvation is an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. In other words, the body expends more energy than it takes in. This imbalance can arise from one or more medical conditions or circumstantial situations, which can include:

'''Medical reasons'''
*[[Anorexia nervosa]]
*[[Bulimia nervosa]]
*[[EDNOS|Eating disorder, not otherwise specified]]
*[[Celiac disease]]
*[[Coma]]
*[[Major depressive disorder]]
*[[Diabetes mellitus]]
*[[Digestive disease]]
*Constant [[vomiting]]

'''Circumstantial causes'''
* Child/ Elder/ Dependent Abuse
*[[Famine]]{{spaced ndash}}for any reason, such as political strife and war
*Excessive [[fasting]]
*[[Poverty]]
The main causes of starvation are as follows:
*Economy; poor people sometimes cannot buy enough foodstuffs and thereby fail to fulfill the caloric demands of the body.
*Food scarcity in the society. This causes a decreased supply of food to the whole of the population, and thus mass starvation may occur.
*Diseases that can cause rapid weight loss either due to the nature of the disease or the inability of the person to either eat or eat enough due to symptoms including fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. The person may also be the host to a parasite such as an intestinal worm which may take a significant amount of the calories ingested by its host. This effect is exacerbated if the human host is already ingesting far less food than is required to meet their daily caloric intake needs.
*Clinical conditions, such as recovering from surgery or burns, etc., in which the person may be too fatigued or incapacitated to eat enough during their period of convalescence.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Girl affected by famine in Buguruslan, Russia - 1921.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Starving Russian girl during the [[Russian famine of 1921]]]]

Early symptoms include impulsivity, irritability, and hyperactivity. [[Atrophy]] (wasting away) of the stomach weakens the perception of hunger, since the perception is controlled by the percentage of the stomach that is empty. Individuals experiencing starvation lose substantial [[fat]] ([[adipose tissue]]) and muscle mass as the body breaks down these tissues for energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With spirulina, and together, we will end child malnutrition in the world. Now.|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/with-spirulina-and-together-we-will-end-child-malnutrition-in-the-world-now|accessdate=Dec 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Catabolysis]]'' is the process of a body breaking down its own muscles and other tissues in order to keep vital systems such as the [[nervous system]] and heart muscle [[Cardiac muscle|(myocardium)]] functioning. The energy deficiency inherent in starvation causes [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and renders the victim more [[apathetic]] over time. As the starving person becomes too weak to move or even eat, their interaction with the surrounding world diminishes. In females, [[Amenorrhoea|menstruation ceases]] when the body fat percentage is too low to support a fetus.

Victims of starvation are often too weak to sense thirst, and therefore become [[dehydrated]]. All movements become painful due to muscle atrophy and dry, cracked skin that is caused by severe dehydration. With a weakened body, diseases are commonplace. Fungi, for example, often grow under the [[esophagus]], making swallowing painful. [[Vitamin deficiency]] is also a common result of starvation, often leading to [[anemia]], [[beriberi]], [[pellagra]], and [[scurvy]]. These diseases collectively can also cause [[diarrhea]], [[skin rashes]], [[edema]], and [[heart failure]]. Individuals are often irritable and lethargic as a result.

There is insufficient scientific data on exactly how long people can live without food.&lt;ref name="WebMD"&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the loss reaches 40% death is almost inevitable.&lt;ref name="Pojman" /&gt;

==Biochemistry==
Under normal metabolic conditions, the human body relies on free [[blood glucose]] as its primary energy source. The level of blood sugar is [[Blood sugar regulation|tightly regulated]]; as blood glucose is consumed, the [[pancreas]] releases [[glucagon]], a hormone that stimulates the [[liver]] to convert stored [[glycogen]] into glucose. The glycogen stores are ordinarily replenished after every meal, but if the store is depleted before it can be replenished, the body enters [[hypoglycemia]], and begins the [[starvation response]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

After the exhaustion of the glycogen reserve, and for the next 2–3 days, [[lipolysis|fatty acids become the principal metabolic fuel]]. At first, the brain continues to use glucose, because, if a non-brain tissue is using fatty acids as its metabolic fuel, the use of glucose in the same tissue is switched off.  Thus, when fatty acids are being broken down for energy, all of the remaining glucose is made available for use by the brain. Basically the body will use up stored fat cells first, then move on to muscles.

After 2 or 3 days of fasting, the liver begins to synthesize [[ketone bodies]] from precursors obtained from fatty acid breakdown. The brain uses these ketone bodies as fuel, thus cutting its requirement for glucose. After fasting for 3 days, the brain gets 30% of its energy from ketone bodies. After 4 days, this goes up to 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=C. J. Coffee |title=Quick Look: Metabolism |date=Dec 1, 2004 |publisher=Hayes Barton Press |pages=169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the production of ketone bodies cuts the brain's glucose requirement from 80 g per day to about 30 g per day. Of the remaining 30 g requirement, 20 g per day can be produced by the liver from [[glycerol]] (itself a product of fat breakdown). But this still leaves a deficit of about 10 g of glucose per day that must be supplied from some other source. This other source will be the body's own proteins.

After several days of fasting, all cells in the body [[proteolysis|begin to break down protein]]. This releases [[alanine]] and [[lactic acid|lactate]] produced from [[pyruvate]] into the bloodstream, which can be converted into glucose by the liver. Since much of human muscle mass is protein, this phenomenon is responsible for the wasting away of muscle mass seen in starvation. However, the body is able to selectively decide which cells will break down protein and which will not. About 2–3 g of protein has to be broken down to synthesize 1 g of glucose; about 20–30 g of protein is broken down each day to make 10 g of glucose to keep the brain alive. However, this number may decrease the longer the fasting period is continued in order to conserve protein.

Starvation ensues when the fat reserves are completely exhausted and protein is the only fuel source available to the body. Thus, after periods of starvation, the loss of body protein affects the function of important organs, and death results, even if there are still fat reserves left unused. (In a leaner person, the fat reserves are depleted earlier, the protein depletion occurs sooner, and therefore death occurs sooner.) The ultimate cause of death is, in general, [[cardiac arrhythmia]] or [[cardiac arrest]] brought on by tissue degradation and [[electrolyte]] imbalances.

==Prevention==

For the individual, prevention consists of ensuring they eat plenty of food, varied enough to provide a nutritionally complete diet.

Starvation can be caused by factors, other than illness, outside of the control of the individual. The [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security]] outlines several policies aimed at increasing [[food security]]&lt;ref name=faoromedeclaration &gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.htm World Food Summit - Rome Declaration on World Food Security]&lt;/ref&gt; and, consequently, preventing starvation.  These include:
*[[Poverty reduction]]
*Prevention of [[War#On civilians|wars]] and [[Failed state|political instability]]
*[[Aid|Food aid]]
*[[Sustainable agriculture|Agricultural sustainability]]
*Reduction of [[economic inequality]]

Supporting [[farmer]]s in areas of food insecurity through such measures as free or subsidized [[fertilizer]]s and [[seed]]s increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Starving patients can be treated, but this must be done cautiously to avoid [[refeeding syndrome]].&lt;ref name="pmid18583681"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehanna HM, Moledina J, Travis J |title=Refeeding syndrome: what it is, and how to prevent and treat it |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7659 |pages=1495–8 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18583681 |pmc=2440847 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a301 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18583681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rest and warmth must be provided and maintained. Small sips of water mixed with [[glucose]] should be given in regular intervals. Fruit juices can also be given. Later, food can be given gradually in small quantities. The quantity of food can be increased over time. Proteins may be administered intravenously to raise the level of [[serum (blood)|serum]] proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Physiology and Treatment of Starvation |pmc=2181967 |publisher=US national library of medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
{{Main article|Famine relief}}
Many organizations have been highly effective at reducing starvation in different regions. Aid agencies give direct assistance to individuals, while political organizations pressure political leaders to enact more macro-scale policies that will reduce famine and provide aid.

==Starvation statistics==
{{Main article|Malnutrition|Hunger}}
According to estimates by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] there were 925 million under- or malnourished people in the world in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/hunger/en/ FAO:Hunger]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a decrease from an estimate of roughly 1 billion malnourished people in 2009.&lt;ref name=state2010&gt;[http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/ The State of Food Insecurity in the World, 2010: Addressing Food Insecurity in Protracted Crises]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 923 million people were reported as being undernourished, an increase of 80 million since 1990-92.&lt;ref&gt;[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] Economic and Social Development Department. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/011/i0291e/i0291e00.htm “The State of Food Insecurity in the World, 2008 : High food prices and food security - threats and opportunities”].

As the definitions of starving and malnourished people are different, the number of starving people is different from that of malnourished. Generally, far fewer people are starving, than are malnourished.

The proportion of malnourished and of starving people in the world has been more or less continually decreasing for at least several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Fogel, RW (2004).

In 40 years, the proportion of malnourished people in the developing world has been more than halved. The proportion of starving people has decreased even faster.

Historically, starvation has been used as a [[death sentence]]. From the beginning of civilization to the [[Middle Ages]], people were [[immurement|immured]], or walled in, and would die for want of food.

In ancient Greco-Roman societies, starvation was sometimes used to dispose of guilty upper class citizens, especially erring female members of patrician families. For instance, in the year 31, [[Livilla]], the niece and daughter-in-law of [[Tiberius]], was discreetly starved to death by her mother for her adulterous relationship with [[Sejanus]] and for her complicity in the murder of her own husband, [[Drusus the Younger]].

Another daughter-in-law of Tiberius, named [[Agrippina the Elder]] (a granddaughter of [[Augustus]] and the mother of [[Caligula]]), also died of starvation, in 33 AD. (However, it is not clear whether her starvation was self-inflicted.)

A son and daughter of Agrippina were also executed by starvation for political reasons; [[Drusus Caesar]], her second son, was put in prison in 33 AD, and starved to death by orders of Tiberius (he managed to stay alive for nine days by chewing the stuffing of his bed); Agrippina's youngest daughter, [[Julia Livilla]], was exiled on an island in 41 by her uncle, Emperor [[Claudius]], and subsequently her death by starvation was arranged by the empress [[Messalina]].

[[File:Mongolian woman condemned to die of starvation (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A [[Mongolia]]n woman condemned to die of starvation, c. 1913]]
It is also possible that [[Vestal Virgin]]s were starved when found guilty of breaking their vows of [[celibacy]].

[[Ugolino della Gherardesca]], his sons and other members of his family were immured in the [[Muda (tower)|Muda]], a tower of [[Pisa]], and starved to death in the thirteenth century. [[Dante]], his contemporary, wrote about Gherardesca in his masterpiece ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''.

In [[Sweden]] in 1317, King [[Birger, King of Sweden|Birger of Sweden]] imprisoned his two brothers for a coup they had staged several years earlier ([[Nyköping Banquet]]). According to legend they died of starvation a few weeks later, since their brother had thrown the prison key in the castle moat.

In Cornwall in the UK in 1671, [[John Trehenban]] from [[St Columb Major]] was condemned to be starved to death in a cage at [[Castle An Dinas]] for the murder of two girls.
The [[Makah]], a Native American tribe inhabiting the Pacific Northwest near the modern border of Canada and the United States, practiced death by starvation as a punishment for slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Leland (1997). Aboriginal Slavery on the Northwest Coast of North America, University of California Press, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concentration camps and ghettos==

Many of the prisoners died in the [[Nazi concentration camp]]s through deliberate maltreatment, disease, starvation, and overwork, or were executed as unfit for labor. Many occupants of [[ghetto]]s in eastern Europe also starved to death, most notoriously in the [[Warsaw ghetto]]. Prisoners were [[Holocaust trains|transported in inhumane conditions by rail freight cars]], in which many died before reaching their destination. The prisoners were confined to the [[cattle car]]s for days or even weeks, with little or no food or water. Many died of [[dehydration]] in the intense heat of summer or froze to death in winter. Nazi concentration camps in Europe from 1933 to 1945 deliberately underfed prisoners, who were at the same time forced to perform heavy labour. The [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] was restricted to watery vegetable soup and a little bread, with little or no [[dietary fat]]s, [[protein]]s or other essential [[nutrient]]s. Such treatment led to loss of body tissues, and prisoners became skeletal, the so-called [[Muselmann]] who were murdered by gas or bullet when examined by camp doctors.
[[File:DBP 1973 771 Maximilian Kolbe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maximilian Kolbe]], on a West German postage stamp, marked [[Auschwitz]]]]
Starvation was also used as a punishment where victims were locked into a small cell until dead, a process which could take many days.
Saint [[Maximilian Kolbe]], a martyred Polish friar, underwent a sentence of starvation in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in 1941. Ten prisoners had been condemned to death by starvation in the wake of a successful escape from the camp. Kolbe volunteered to take the place of a man with a wife and children. After two weeks of starvation, Kolbe and three other inmates remained alive; they were then executed with injections of [[phenol]].

'''Sąjūdis''' ({{IPA-lt|ˈsâːjuːdʲɪs|lang}}, "Movement"), initially known as the '''Reform Movement of Lithuania''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos Persitvarkymo Sąjūdis}}), is the political organisation which led the struggle for [[Lithuania]]n independence in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was established on 3 June 1988, and was led by [[Vytautas Landsbergis]]. Its goal was to seek the return of independent status for Lithuania.    
                                    
==Historical background==
{{main|Singing Revolution}}
In the mid-1980s, Lithuania's Communist Party leadership hesitated to embrace Gorbachev's [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]. The death of [[Petras Griškevičius]], first secretary of the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]], in 1987 was merely followed by the appointment of another rigid communist, [[Ringaudas Songaila]]. However, encouraged by the rhetoric of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], noting the strengthening position of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] in Poland and encouraged by the Pope and the U.S. Government, Baltic independence activists began to hold public demonstrations in [[Riga]], [[Tallinn]], and [[Vilnius]].

==Formation==
At a meeting at the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences on 3 June 1988, communist and non-communist intellectuals formed Sąjūdis Initiative Group (Lithuanian: ''Sąjūdžio iniciatyvinė grupė'') to organise a movement to support Gorbachev's program of glasnost, democratisation, and perestroika. The group composed of 35 members, mostly artists. 17 of the group members were also communist party members. Its goal was to organise the Sąjūdis Reform Movement, which became known subsequently simply as Sąjūdis.

On 24 June 1988, the first massive gathering organised by Sąjūdis took place. There delegates to the 19th All-Union Conference of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] were instructed about Sąjūdis goals. About 100,000 people in [[Vingis Park]] greeted the delegates when they came back in July. Another massive event took place on 23 August 1988, when about 250,000 people gathered to protest against the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]] and its secret protocol.

On 19 June 1988 the first issue of [[samizdat]] newspaper "Sąjūdis News" (Lithuanian: ''Sąjūdžio žinios'') was published. In September Sąjūdis published a legal newspaper, "Atgimimas" (English: ''rebirth''). In total about 150 different newspapers were printed supporting Sąjūdis.

In October 1988 Sąjūdis held its founding conference in Vilnius. It elected 35-member council. Most its members were members of the initiative group. [[Vytautas Landsbergis]], a professor of musicology who was not a member of the communist party, became the council's chairman.

[[File:Targa Sajudis.JPG|thumb|Sajudis plaque at old headquarters of the movement, now Ireland's embassy. Vilnius, 1 Šventaragio g.]]

==Activities==
The movement supported Gorbachev's policies, but at the same time promoted Lithuanian national issues such as restoration of the [[Lithuanian language]] as the official language. Its demands included the revelation of truth about the Stalinist years, protection of the environment, the halt to construction on a third nuclear reactor at the [[Ignalina nuclear power plant]], and disclosure of the secret protocols of the Nazi-Soviet Non-aggression Pact, signed in 1939.

Sąjūdis used mass meetings to advance its goals. At first, Communist Party leaders shunned these meetings, but by mid-1988 their participation became a political necessity. A Sąjūdis rally on 24 June 1988, was attended by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]], then party secretary for industrial affairs. In October 1988, Brazauskas was appointed first secretary of the communist party to replace [[Ringaudas Songaila|Songaila]]. Communist leaders threatened to crack down on Sąjūdis, but backed down in the face of mass protests. Sąjūdis candidates fared well in elections to the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]], the newly created Soviet legislative body. Their candidates won in 36 of the 40 districts in which they ran.

In February 1989 Sąjūdis declared that Lithuania had been forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union and that the group's ultimate goal was to achieve independence. Lithuanian sovereignty was proclaimed in May 1989, and Lithuania's incorporation into the Soviet Union was declared illegal.

On 23 August 1989, the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Nazi-Soviet [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], a 600-kilometre, two-million-strong human chain reaching from Tallinn to Vilnius focused international attention on the aspirations of the Baltic nations. This demonstration and the coordinated efforts of the three nations became known as The [[Baltic Way]].

In December the Communist Party of Lithuania seceded from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and agreed to give up its monopoly on power. In February 1990 Sąjūdis representatives won an absolute majority (101 seats out of 141) in the [[Supreme Council of the Lithuanian SSR]]. Vytautas Landsbergis was elected chairman of the Supreme Council. This led to the declaration of independence on 11 March 1990.

==After independence==
Today, Sąjūdis is still active in [[Lithuania]], but it has lost almost all its influence. The popularity of Sąjūdis lessened as it failed to maintain unity among people with different political beliefs and was ineffective coping with the economic crisis. The [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania|Democratic Labour Party]] (DLP; the former Communist Party of Lithuania) was victorious in the [[Seimas]] elections of November 1992.

Much of the group, including Landsbergis, formed the core of the [[Homeland Union]], now the largest centre-right party in Lithuania.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6035">The '''Tran Organization''' was a [[criminal conspiracy|criminal gang]] of [[cheating in casinos|casino cheats]] in the 2000s.  The group targeted at least 28 casinos across the United States and one in Canada.  The casinos lost around $7,000,000 to the organization.  {{As of|2011}}, 47 people were [[indictment|indicted]], of which 42 had already pleaded guilty in relation to the conspiracy.&lt;ref name="doj-20110114"&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://www.fbi.gov/sandiego/press-releases/2011/sd011411.htm | title = Co-Founder of Casino-Cheating Criminal Enterprise Pleads Guilty to Racketeering Conspiracy Targeting Casinos Across the United States | date = January 14, 2011 | accessdate = 2014-08-08 | publisher = [[United States Department of Justice]], Office of Public Affairs | location = Washington, D.C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Gambling scheme===
The criminal enterprise started around August 2002 in [[San Diego, California]], and included Van Thu Tran, her husband Phuong Quoc "Pai Gao John" Truong,&lt;ref name="abcnews-oceans11"/&gt; and Tai Khiem Tran.&lt;ref name="doj-20110114"/&gt;  Many other members of the Tran family were also involved in the organization.&lt;ref name="fbi-houseofcards"&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2011/february/cards_021111/ | title = House of Cards: Casino Cheating Ring Dismantled | date = 2011-02-11 | publisher = [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] | location = Washington, D.C. | accessdate = 2014-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizers had themselves been [[croupier|card dealer]]s.&lt;ref name="abcnews-oceans11"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Business/real-life-oceans-11-agents-foiled-million-casino/story?id=16425553&amp;singlePage=true | title = Real-Life 'Ocean's 11': How Agents Foiled a $7 Million Casino Scheme | date = May 25, 2012 | first = Eamon | last = McNiff | publisher = [[ABC News]] Internet Ventures | accessdate = 2014-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organizers bribed card dealers and casino supervisors to do [[false shuffle]]s to create "slugs" of cards with already-seen sequences.&lt;ref name="doj-20110114"/&gt;  The system worked especially well with [[mini-baccarat]], in which players are allowed to track cards openly.  They later expanded to [[blackjack]], in which the betting limits are higher but [[card counting]] is forbidden at most casinos; the group hid [[wireless microphone]]s and earpieces on themselves to communicate with conspirators using computer programs to predict which cards would re-appear.&lt;ref name="doj-20110114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews-oceans11"/&gt;

Casinos often didn't realize they were being cheated until after the gang had already left town.&lt;ref name="abcnews-oceans11"/&gt;  Some casinos, suspecting they were being cheated in an unknown way, called on government authorities.&lt;ref name="fbi-houseofcards"/&gt;  

===Investigation and arrests===

{{Rape}}

[[Rape]] can be categorized in different ways: for example, by reference to the situation in which it occurs, by the identity or characteristics of the victim, and by the identity or characteristics of the perpetrator. These categories are referred to as '''types of rape'''. The types of rape described below are not mutually exclusive: a given rape can fit into multiple categories, by for example by being both a prison rape and a gang rape, or both a custodial rape and the rape of a child.

== Date rape ==
{{Main article|Date rape}}

The term "date rape" is used to refer to several types of rape, broadly [[acquaintance rape]], which is a non-domestic rape committed by someone who knows the victim,&lt;ref name=Humphreys&gt;Humphreys, Terence Patrick (1993). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/621/ Gender differences in the perception of rape: The role of ambiguity]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt; and [[drug facilitated sexual assault]] (DFSA), where the rapist intentionally drugs the victim with a [[date rape drug]] so that they are incapacitated. Acquaintance rape constitutes the vast majority of reported rapes, while [[Drug facilitated sexual assault#Frequency of occurrence|DFSA is infrequent]]. A frequently overlapping category is ''incapacitated rape,'' where the victim is incapacitated and unable to give consent – this is often the result of intoxication, but can also simply be because the victim is asleep or has a medical condition. DFSA is when the rapist intentionally incapacitates the victim via drugs, while acquaintance rape can occur when the victim is not incapacitated.

Acquaintance rape can occur between two people who know one another usually in social situations, between people who are dating as a couple and have had consensual sex in the past, between two people who are starting to date, between people who are just friends, and between acquaintances. They include rapes of co-workers, schoolmates, family, friends, teachers and other acquaintances, providing they are dating;&lt;ref name="Annual Crime Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.cambridge.ma.us/CPD/reports/1997/rape.html|title=Cambridge Police 97 crime report|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829131749/http://www.ci.cambridge.ma.us/CPD/reports/1997/rape.html|archivedate=2009-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes referred to as "hidden rape" and has been identified as a growing problem in [[western society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaets.org/arts/art13.htm |title=Perspectives on Acquaintance Rape|publisher= |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A college survey conducted by the United States' National Victim Center reported that one in four college women have been raped or experienced attempted rape.&lt;ref name="Bureau of Justice Statistics 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Office of Justice Programs|year=1996|title=National Victimization Survey, U.S. Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This report indicates that young women are at considerable risk of becoming a victim of date rape while in college. In addition, there have been reported incidents of colleges questioning accounts of alleged victims, further complicating documentation and policing of student assaults, despite such preventative legislation as the [[Clery Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/campus_inq/Feds-launch-investigation-into-Swarthmores-handling-of-sex-assaults.html|title=Feds launch investigation into Swarthmore's handling of sex assaults|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/article_d684d872-1e7e-11e3-978b-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Annual campus crime report may not tell true story of student crime|work=[[Daily Nebraskan]]|date=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gang rape ==
{{Main article|Gang rape}}

Gang rape occurs when a group of people participate in the rape of a single victim. Rape involving at least two or more violators (usually at least three&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Neumann, Stephani. Gang Rape: Examining Peer Support and Alcohol in Fraternities. Sex Crimes and Paraphilia. Hickey, Eric W., 397-407&lt;/ref&gt;) is widely reported to occur in many parts of the world. Systematic information on the extent of the problem, however, is scant.

One study showed that offenders and victims in gang rape incidents were younger with a higher possibility of being unemployed. Gang rapes involved more alcohol and other [[Substance abuse|drug use]], night attacks and severe sexual assault outcomes and less victim resistance and fewer weapons than individual rapes.&lt;ref name=Ullman1999&gt;{{cite journal   | author = Ullman, S.E.  | year = 1999 | title = A Comparison of Gang and Individual Rape Incidents  | journal = Violence and Victims  | volume = 14  | issue = 2  | pages = 123–133 | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/springer/vav/1999/00000014/00000002/art00001
| accessdate = 2008-05-21   | pmid = 10418766}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that group sexual assaults were more violent and had greater resistance from the victim than individual sexual assaults and that victims of group sexual assaults were more likely to seek crisis and police services, contemplate [[suicide]], and seek therapy than those involved in individual assaults. The two groups were about the same in the amount of drinking and other drug use during the assault.&lt;ref name=Gidycz1990&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Gidycz, C.A.  |author2=Koss, M.P.   | year = 1990  | title = A Comparison Of Group And Individual Sexual Assault Victims  | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly  | volume = 14  | issue = 3  | pages = 325–342  | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1990.tb00023.x
|citeseerx=10.1.1.1015.2268   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spousal rape ==
{{Main article|Marital rape}}
Also known as marital rape, wife rape, husband rape, partner rape or intimate partner sexual assault (IPSA), is rape between a married or ''de facto'' couple. Research reveals that victims of marital/partner rape suffer longer lasting trauma than victims of stranger rape.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelhor and Yllo (1985) and Bergen (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rape of children ==
{{Main article|Child sexual abuse}}

{{See also|Incest|Child-on-child sexual abuse}}
Rape of a child is a form of [[child sexual abuse]]. When committed by another child (usually older or stronger) or adolescent, it is called [[child-on-child sexual abuse]]. When committed by a parent or other close relatives such as grandparents, aunts and uncles, it is also [[incest]] and can result in serious and long-term psychological [[Psychological trauma|trauma]].&lt;ref name=Courtois&gt;{{cite book|title=Healing the Incest Wound: Adult Survivors in Therapy|last= Courtois|first=Christine A.|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|page=208|year=1988|isbn= 978-0-393-31356-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a child is raped by an adult who is not a family member but is a caregiver or in a position of authority over the child, such as school teachers, religious authorities, sports trainers (coaches) or therapists, to name a few, on whom the child is dependent, the effects can be similar to incestual rape.

== Statutory rape ==
{{further information|Statutory rape}}
National and regional [[governments]], citing an interest in protecting "young people" (variously defined but sometimes synonymous with [[minor (law)|minor]]s) from sexual exploitation, treat any sexual contact with such a person as an offense (not always categorized as "rape"), even if he or she agrees to or initiates the sexual activity.

The offense is often based on a presumption that people under a certain age do not have the capacity to give consent. The age at which individuals are considered competent to give consent, called the [[age of consent]], varies in different countries and regions; in the US, the age ranges from 16 to 18. Sexual activity that violates age-of-consent law, but is neither violent nor physically coerced, is sometimes described as "[[statutory rape]]", a legally-recognized category in the [[United States]]. Most states, however, allow persons younger than the age of consent to engage in sexual activity if the age difference between the partners is small; these are called close-in-age exemptions or a [[Statutory rape#Romeo and Juliet laws|Romeo and Juliet exemption]] and even in countries where there is no official legal exemption prosecutions are infrequent.

== Prison rape ==
{{Main article|Prison rape}}
Rates of [[prison]] rape have been reported as affecting between 3% and 12% of prison inmates in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Struckman-Johnson |first=C. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Struckman-Johnson |first2=D. |title=A Comparison of Sexual Coercion Experiences Reported by Men and Women in Prison |journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=1591–1615 |doi=10.1177/0886260506294240 |pmid=17065656 |year=2006 |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although prison rapes are more commonly same-sex crimes (since prisons are usually separated by sex), the attacker usually does not identify as homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report4.html#_1_27 No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons - IV. Predators and Victims] hrw.org&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is much less common elsewhere in the western world. This is partly because of the differences in the structure of the prison system in the US as compared to the prison systems in Canada, Australia and Europe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The attacker is most commonly another inmate.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Allen J. &amp; Harrison, Paige M., July 2006, "[http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Sexual_Violence_Reported_by_Correctional_Authorities,_2005.pdf Sexual Violence Reported by Correctional Authorities, 2005", Bureau of Justice Statistics, Special Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Serial rape ==
{{Main article|Serial rapist}}
Serial rape is rape committed by a person over a relatively long period of time and committed on a number of victims. Most times this type of rapist is unknown to the victim and follows a specific and predictable pattern of targeting and assaulting victims.

== Payback rape ==

"Payback rape", also called "punishment rape" or "revenge rape", is a form of rape specific to certain cultures, particularly the [[Pacific Islands]]. It consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by  members of her family, such as her father or brothers. The rape is meant to humiliate the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behavior towards the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supplement to the HANDBOOK FOR LEGISLATION ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN: "Harmful Practices" against Women|url=http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf|publisher=[[UN Women]]|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payback rape is sometimes connected to tribal fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many voices, one message|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/svaw/comments/22174/|website=[[Amnesty International]] Australia|accessdate=28 May 2018|date= 24 November 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120303085123/https://www.amnesty.org.au/svaw/comments/22174/ |archive-date=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== War rape ==
{{Main article|War rape}}
[[File:Paul Jamin - Le Brenn et sa part de butin 1893.jpg|thumb|''[[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]] and His Share of the Spoils'', by [[Paul Jamin]], 1893]]

'''War rapes''' are rapes committed by soldiers, other combatants or civilians during armed conflict or war, or during military occupation. It also covers the situation where girls and women are forced into prostitution or [[sexual slavery]] by an occupying power.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

During war, rape is often used as a means of [[psychological warfare]] in order to humiliate the enemy and undermine their morale. Rapes in war are often systematic and thorough, and military leaders may actually encourage their soldiers to rape civilians. Likewise, systematic rapes are often employed as a form of [[ethnic cleansing]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

War rape has been considered a [[war crime]] only since 1949. Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention explicitly prohibits wartime rape and enforced prostitution. These prohibitions were reinforced by the [[Protocol I|1977 Additional Protocols]] to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Askin, Kelly Dawn (1997). ''War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals.'' Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. [https://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC&amp;pg=PA17 p. 17] {{ISBN|90-411-0486-0}}..&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, during the post-war [[Nuremberg Trials]] and [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo Trials]], mass war rape was not prosecuted as a war crime.

In 1998, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] established by the [[United Nations]] made landmark decisions that rape is a crime of [[genocide]] under [[international law]]. In one judgement, [[Navanethem Pillay]] said: "From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as spoils of war. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in citation for honorary doctorate, Rhodes University, April 2005 accessed at {{cite web|url=http://www.ru.ac.za/academic/graduation/addresses_and_citations/2005/Judge_Pillay_citation.doc |title=Judge Navanethem Pillay |accessdate=2008-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926231120/http://www.ru.ac.za/academic/graduation/addresses_and_citations/2005/Judge_Pillay_citation.doc |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''rape'' only began to be used to refer to sexual assault in the early 15th century, and its dominant usage remained to refer to abduction and robbery without any connotation of sexual assault until the modern period. Many classical references to rape during war do not refer explicitly to instances of sexual assault, but rather to the practice of abducting the women or property of the enemy during warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Etymological Dictionary, "Rape".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rape by deception ==
{{Main article|Rape by deception}}

Rape by deception occurs when the perpetrator gains the victim's agreement through [[fraud]]. In one case, a man pretended to be an official for a government who had power to cause negative impacts on a woman to pressure a woman into sexual activities. The courts held that he had falsely represented himself and thus used deception against the woman.

== Corrective rape ==
{{Main article|Corrective rape}}

Corrective rape is targeted rape against [[non-heterosexual]]s as a punishment for violating [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name="Bartle"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Bartle| first = EE| title = Lesbians And Hate Crimes| journal = Journal of Poverty| volume = 4| issue = 4| year = 2000 | citeseerx=10.1.1.196.9177 | pages= 23–44| doi = 10.1300/J134v04n04_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Di"&gt;
Di Silvio, Lorenzo. "Correcting Corrective Rape: Carmichele and Developing South Africa’s Affirmative Obligations To Prevent Violence Against Women." ''Georgetown Law Journal'' 99 (2011): 1469–515.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a form of [[hate crime]] against [[LGBT]] individuals, mainly lesbians, in which the rapist justifies the act as an acceptable response to the victim's perceived sexual or gender orientation and a form of punishment for being gay.&lt;ref name="Bartle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Di"/&gt; Often, the stated argument of the corrective rapist is that the rape will turn the person straight, "correcting" their sex or gender, i.e. make them conform to societal norms.&lt;ref name="Bartle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Di"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Mieses| first = A | title = Gender inequality and corrective rape of women who have sex with women | url = http://www.asylumlaw.org/docs/sexualminorities/LesbianIssuesti-1209.pdf | format = pdf | year = 2009 | work = GMHC Treatment Issues |  publisher = asylumlaw.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was first coined in South Africa after well-known cases of corrective rape, such as that of sports star [[Eudy Simelane]], became public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13908662 | date= 2011-06-29 | title = South Africa's lesbians fear 'corrective rape' | last = Fihlani | first = P | accessdate = 2012-04-16 | publisher = [[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Custodial rape ==

Custodial rape is rape perpetrated by a person employed by the state in a supervisory or custodial position, such as a police officer, public servant or jail or hospital employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women of India: Their Status Since the Vedic Times|last = Kumbhare|first = Arun R.|publisher = iUniverse|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1440156007|location = |pages = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Expanding Governmental Lawlessness and Organized Struggles|last = Desai|first = A.R.|publisher = South Asia Books|year = 1991|isbn = 978-8171545292|location = |pages = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women and Human Rights|last = Gonsalves|first = Lisa|publisher = APH Publishing Corporation|year = 2001|isbn = 978-8176482479|location = |pages = 151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the rape of children in institutional care such as orphanages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Still Out of Focus: Status of India's Children, 2008|last = Thukral|first = Enakshi Ganguly|publisher = HAQ Centre for Child Rights|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India custodial rape has been a major focus of women's rights organizations, and has been an official category of rape defined under law since 1983. Indian law says this type of rape takes advantage of the rapist's position of authority and is therefore subject to extra penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Legal Apptitude And Legal Reasoning For The Clat|last = Bhardwaj|first = A.P.|publisher = Dorling Kindersley (India) Pvt.

The term custodial rape is sometimes used broadly to include rape by anyone in a position of authority such as an employer, money-lender, contractor or landlord, but under Indian law it refers only to government employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in Asia: Tradition, Modernity and Globalisation|last = Edwards|first = Louise|publisher = University of Michigan Press|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0472087518|location = |pages = 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims of custodial rape are frequently minorities, people who are poor, or low-status for example because of their caste.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Researchers say custodial rape is part of a broader pattern of custodial abuse, which can also include [[torture]] and [[murder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2008: Vols.

== Perpetrator types ==
{{Main article|Types of rapist}}

Nicholas Groth has described three types of rape, based on the goal of the rapist. This includes the anger rapist, power rapist and sadistic rapist.&lt;ref name="CSOM"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csom.org/train/supervision/short/01_02_03.html | title = Center for Sex Offender Management Lecture Content &amp; Teaching Notes Supervision of Sex Offenders in the Community: An Overview | accessdate = 2008-05-26 | publisher = Center for Sex Offender Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Howard Barbaree]], a psychologist at [[Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], most rapes are impulsive and opportunistic, and committed by people who may commit other impulsive acts, including impulsive crimes. These rapists tend to show no anger except in response to their victim's resistance, and use little unnecessary force.

== Further classification ==

As mentioned above, when differing acts of rape are defined and typified, whether by popular convention, research of the subject, or otherwise, the results are often neither exclusive nor exhaustive in scope. Some instances may fit two or more definitions, while others may remain as yet undefined. One example of this are the following sub-classifications created by American researcher Patricia Rozee:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook on the Study of Multiple Perpetrator Rape: A multidisciplinary response to an international problem|last = Horvath|first = Miranda A.H|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0415500449|location = |pages = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Overcoming Violence against Women and Girls: The International Campaign to Eradicate a Worldwide Problem|last = Nardos|first = Rahel|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year = 2003|isbn = 978-0742525009|location = |pages = 54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''exchange rape''' - rape occurring as the result of bargaining or solidarity-displaying among men
* '''punitive rape''' - rape used to punish or discipline
* '''theft rape''' - rape that happens when a woman or man is abducted, in most cases to be used as a slave or a prostitute
* '''ceremonial rape''' - rape involving [[deflower|defloration]] rituals
* '''status rape''' - rape resulting from differences in hierarchy or social class

Where they are not already typed above, many of these otherwise distinct forms could equally apply to other classifications (e.g. prison rape that is also punitive rape, war rape that is also theft rape, etc.)

'''Website spoofing''' is the act of creating a [[website]], as a [[hoax]], with the intention of misleading readers that the website has been created by a different person or organization. Normally, the spoof website will adopt the design of the target website and sometimes has a similar [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3936497.stm "Spoof website will stay online"], BBC News, 29 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A more sophisticated attack results in an attacker creating a "shadow copy" of the World Wide Web by having all of the victim's traffic go through the attacker's machine, causing the attacker to obtain the victim's sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/pub/spoofing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique is to use a 'cloaked' URL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfbay-infragard.org/Documents/phishing-sfectf-report.pdf Anti-Phishing Technology"], Aaron Emigh, Radix Labs, 19 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By  using [[URL redirection|domain forwarding]], or inserting [[control character]]s, the URL can appear to be genuine while concealing the address of the actual website.

The objective may be fraudulent, often associated with [[phishing]] or [[e-mail spoofing]], or to criticize or make fun of the person or body whose website the spoofed site purports to represent. Because the purpose is often malicious, "spoof" (an expression whose base meaning is innocent parody) is a poor term for this activity so that more accountable organisations such as government departments and banks tend to avoid it, preferring more explicit descriptors such as "fraudulent" or "phishing".&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/security/index.htm] or [http://www.lloydstsb.com/security/phishing.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of the use of this technique to [[parody]] an organisation, in November 2006 two spoof websites, www.msfirefox.com and www.msfirefox.net, were produced claiming that [[Microsoft]] had bought [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]] and released "Microsoft Firefox 2007."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=193700190 "Fake Sites Insist Microsoft Bought Firefox"], Gregg Keizer, [[InformationWeek]], 9 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention Tools ==


=== Anti-Phishing Software ===

Spoofed websites predominate in efforts developing [[anti-phishing software]] though there are concerns about their effectiveness. A majority of efforts are focused on the PC market leaving mobile devices lacking You can see from the table below that few user studies have been run against the current tools in the market. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 2017|title=Phishing environments, techniques, and countermeasures: A survey|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-4048(04)00129-4|journal=Computers &amp; Security|volume=68|issue=|pages=280|doi=10.1016/s0167-4048(04)00129-4|issn=0167-4048|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DNS Filtering ===

DNS is the layer at which [[Botnet|botnets]] control drones. In 2006, [[OpenDNS]]  began offering a free service to prevent users from entering website spoofing sites. Essentially, OpenDNS has gathered a large database from various anti-phishing and anti-botnet organizations as well as its own data to compile a list of known website spoofing offenders. When a user attempts to access one of these bad websites, they are blocked at the [[DNS]] level. [[APWG]] statistics show that most phishing attacks use URLs, not domain names, so there would be a large amount of website spoofing that OpenDNS would be unable to track. At the time of release, OpenDNS is unable to prevent unnamed phishing exploits that sit on Yahoo, Google etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=99089&amp;WT.svl=news1_1|title=Dark Reading {{!}} Security {{!}} Protect The Business - Enable Access|website=Dark Reading|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CommunityofChrist_Auditoriu.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Community of Christ ]] [[Auditorium (Community of Christ)|auditorium]]]]
'''World Conference''' is the highest legislative body in the [[Community of Christ]] and is empowered to act for the entire church. It operates according to a principle known as "[[common consent (Mormonism)|common consent]]" and is presided over by the [[First Presidency (Community of Christ)|First Presidency]]. The functioning of the councils, quorums and orders of the swage are also considered an important part of the World Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofchrist.org/docs/bylaws.asp Community of Christ Bylaws], webpage, retrieved June 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegates to the conference are elected by Mission Center conferences. Motions are often debated vigorously and the results are sometimes close and controversial. World Conferences are traditionally held at Community of swage World Headquarters, with the legislative and main worship services held in the [[Auditorium (Community of Christ)|Auditorium]].

==History==
World Conferences were originally known as "[[General conference (Latter Day Saints)|General Conferences]]." The first General Conference of the church, then known as the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], was held on June 9, 1830—only two months after its organization. Convened in [[Fayette, New York]], it was presided over by [[Joseph Smith]]. The conference included a gathering of the 27 members of the church.  

Originally held semiannually, or as need arose, the church switched to an annual meeting in the late-nineteenth century. With many members desiring to meet more than once a year, summer gatherings were held, starting in 1883, as reunions (a tradition that continues to this day). In the twentieth century, the church decided to meet biannually. Then, at the 2007 World Conference, it was decided that World Conferences would be held tri-annually. Switching to a conference every three years, instead of every two, was anticipated to be less taxing on church resources, and to provide for greater participation by members who reside abroad.  

The most recent World Conference was held June 5–11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title =Official Actions of the 2016 World Conference
 | date =11 June 2016
 | website =Community of Christ
 | access-date =19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agenda and format==
The World Conference Opening Ceremonies traditionally include a ceremony featuring the flags of the nations where the church is organized and often include a welcome address by a featured speaker from another denomination, as well as welcomes by local elected officials. The councils, quorums and orders of the church hold separate meetings during World Conference as do several delegate caucuses. The usual agenda calls for these meetings during weekday mornings,  with most of the general legislative sessions of the World Conference in the afternoon. Evening worship services often include a contemporary worship service, an outreach service, and a service in which the President of the Community of Christ addresses the church in an important address that sets the agenda and tone, not only for the conference, but for the work of the church in the coming years. A group of communion services are usually held on the Sunday morning of the conference, including a very large and well-coordinated service held in the Auditorium, which is regarded by many as one of the highlights of the World Conference. Worship services feature the Auditorium Organ and the Temple Organ. Organ recitals are typically held during the lunch break following the [[Daily Prayer for Peace]]. On occasion, the [[Community of Christ International Peace Award]] has been presented during a World Conference.

==Organization and management==
The Conference Organization and Procedures Committee normally submits the rules and procedures to be followed at a particular conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofchrist.org/copc/default.asp Conference Organization and Procedures Committee], webpage, retrieved June 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The conference manager attends to the logistics of the conference while the World Church Secretary serves as the legislative clerk. Voting is by a show of hands, however on close votes when the chair is in doubt, votes are counted by delegation and apportioned based on the relative membership of each mission center/jurisdiction. This rather complex voting procedure is designed to protect the voting rights of international delegations that may not have been able to recruit a full slate of delegates to represent them in the conference. 

Delegates attend from a majority of the fifty nations where the church is organized. The largest numbers of delegates are from the United States, Canada and French Polynesia. Translators for more than a dozen languages sit overhead the main conference floor and present real time translations of the conference to any of the delegates on the floor who prefer to participate in a language other than English. Numbered lecterns in the conference chamber are available to those who wish to speak. They gain the floor to make motions or speak by submitting a card to a computer attendant at the lectern who enters the request into a queue. In this fashion, the presiding officer is able to call upon speakers with alternating pro and con viewpoints, as well as give preference to priority motions. According to church bylaws Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised is the parliamentary authority for the conference except where they may  be in conflict with the bylaws, adopted rules of order for the conference, and past resolutions.   Great deference is normally shown by most delegates to the President of the church in regards to the management of the agenda and debate, however, controversial issues are sometimes brought to the conference, thoughtfully considered from many viewpoints, and may be decided by close or split votes.

==Main order of business==
The usual items of business that come before the conference are votes to sustain leadership, approve priesthood calls to major offices, elect the Board of Trustees of Graceland University, elect the World Church Finance Board, set the budget for the church, approve legislative resolutions and set the dates for the next conference. When an inspired document is presented to the church by the prophet-president, its consideration and the decision of whether or not to include it in the Doctrine and Covenants becomes the primary matter of reflection for the body.

The '''Mattel World Scrabble Championship 2018''' was a [[Scrabble]] tournament organised by [[Mattel]] and Mindsports Academy (MSA) to determine the [[World Scrabble Championship|world champion]] in English Scrabble held from 23 to 28 October 2018.

The event was split into two divisions according to players' [[World English-Language Scrabble Players' Association]] (WESPA) ratings; the top division comprised some 75 players. 35 games were played on the first four days, after which the top eight proceeded to a 3-game quarterfinals, with the winners advancing to a 5-game semifinals on the same day; the top two players, [[Nigel Richards (Scrabble player)|Nigel Richards]] and Jesse Day, played a best-of-five final the day after for the top prize of €10,000. Richards beat Day 3–1, becoming world champion for an unprecedented fourth time. 

==Background==
[[File:Shepherd's Bush, Westfield shopping centre - geograph.org.uk - 1046377.jpg|thumb|The finals took place at the Westfield Shopping Centre in [[London]].]]
The main event was preceded by a Junior World Scrabble Championship that was won by Pakistani Moiz Ullah Baig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nation.com.pk/24-Oct-2018/pakistan-s-moiz-crowned-world-junior-scrabble-champion|title=Pakistan’s Moiz crowned world junior scrabble champion|date=24 October 2018|newspaper=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Scrabble Championship 2018 took place at the Riveria International Centre in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]], [[England]] from 23 to 27 October, with the finals being held at a "clearview cube" in the Westfield Shopping Centre in [[London]] a day later, as part of Scrabble's 70th anniversary celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/worlds-top-scrabble-players-go-2134795|title=World's top Scrabble players go head-to-head in Devon|last=Smith|first=Colleen|newspaper=Devon Live|date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/new-zealander-nigel-richards-wins-fourth-world-scrabble-championship-title-37467697.html|newspaper=Belfast Telegraph|title=New Zealander Nigel Richards wins fourth World Scrabble Championship title|date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize fund for the tournament was £15,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46013964|title=Sulky word wins Scrabble championship|date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also concurrent events played in five different languages including Catalan, Spanish, French, Norwegian, and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsc2018.azurewebsites.net/|title=World Scrabble Championship 2018|publisher=Mattel|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
===Preliminary===
[[File:Nigel Richards 2018.jpg|thumb|The eventual winner Nigel Richards giving a thumbs up.]]
