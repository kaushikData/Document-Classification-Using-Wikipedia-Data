The '''1978 [[Australian Rally Championship]]''' was a series of six [[rallying]] events held across Australia. It was the eleventh season in the history of the competition.

[[Greg Carr (rally driver)|Greg Carr]] and navigator Fred Gocentas in the [[Ford Escort RS1800]] won the 1978 Championship, finally breaking the dominance of the Datsuns for the past three years.

==Season review==

The eleventh Australian Rally Championship was held over six events across Australia, the season consisting of two events for [[New South Wales]] and one event each for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]] and [[West Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.begavalleyrally.com.au/history/&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1978 season was again a closely fought battle which resulted in a tie at the finish of the last event of the season between the Datsun of Dunkerton and the Escort of Carr.  However the championship was awarded to Carr on a countback as he had three wins to Dunkerton's one.

==The Rallies==

It is governed by delegates of state, provincial, and tribal athletic commissions in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

The organization was formed in the 1980s when executive directors of various boxing commissions met to discuss how boxing was handled in their jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="UNDERSTANDING"&gt;{{cite web|first=Tim |last=Lueckenhoff |date=2002|title=Understanding the Association of Boxing Commissions |work=secondsout.com |url=http://www.secondsout.com/Ringside/business.cfm?ccs=356&amp;cs=9836 |accessdate=23 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217082917/http://www.secondsout.com/Ringside/business.cfm?ccs=356&amp;cs=9836 |archivedate=17 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Annual conventions are held and training/certification courses organized for contest judges and referees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcboxing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_officials_registration.pdf Official registration form, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

*promote uniform [[health and safety standards]] in those sports,
*promote standard reporting between members, including results, injury reports, suspensions and other medical information,
*encourage communication and cooperation between member organizations,
*publish medical and training information and provide education for all boxing and MMA related professionals,
*establish and run a charitable foundation to aid indigent boxers,
*encourage adherence to, and enforcement of, applicable federal laws by each member of the ABC.

'''CC Amfi''', also known as '''Nordlyshallen''' ("The Northern Light Hall") is an indoor sports [[arena]] in [[Hamar]], [[Norway]]. It is mostly used for [[ice hockey]] and is the home arena of [[Storhamar Hockey]]. It has also been used for [[short track speed skating]], [[figure skating]], [[team handball|handball]], events and concerts. The venue has a capacity for 7,000 spectators and was built for the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], where it was used for [[short track speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|short track speed skating]] and [[figure skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|figure skating]]. Other major events held at the arena include the [[1999 IIHF World Championship]] in ice hockey, the [[1999 World Women's Handball Championship]], the [[2012 IPC Ice Sledge Hockey World Championships]] and the [[2016 Winter Youth Olympics]].

Construction of CC Amfi started in August 1991 and it was inaugurated on 25 November 1992, with construction costing 83 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK). The venues are owned by Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, a subsidiary of [[Hamar Municipality]].

==History==

[[File:Hamar OL-Amfi.jpg|thumb|left|June 2011 exterior view of Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre]]

===The Olympic venue===
In the unsuccessful [[Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics]], ice hockey events were proposed played in Hamar and [[Gjøvik]]. However, in the [[Lillehammer bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics]], all ice events were moved to [[Lillehammer]] proper,&lt;ref name=fairytale&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lillehammer.kommune.no/links/113598 |title=An Olympic Fairy Tale |last=Hove-Ødegård |first=Arne |last2=Celius |first2=Sten |last3=Brun |first3=Ivar Ole |publisher=Lillehammer Municipality |year=2004 |accessdate=11 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uv6grx5a?url=http://www.lillehammer.kommune.no/files/75261/ |archivedate=12 December 2010 |page=9 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; after recommendations from the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], who wanted all the ice hockey events to take place in the same town. This would involve building two temporary ice rinks at [[Stampesletta]] in Lillehammer, and after the Olympics moving them to Gjøvik and either [[Moelv]], [[Brumunddal]] or [[Kongsvinger]]. By 1989, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) decided to include short-track speed skating, increasing the number of ice halls from two to three. In April, the [[Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee]] (LOOC) therefore proposed building permanent ice rinks in Hamar and Gjøvik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Også OL-status til Hamar og Gjøvik? |last=Dehlin |first=Håkon |date=5 April 1989 |page=44 |work=[[Aftenposten]] |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC also required that the long-track speed skating be done indoors. Hamar was awarded the venue, [[Vikingskipet]], after Hamar Municipality guaranteed to cover all costs exceeding NOK&amp;nbsp;200 million. This provided sufficient leverage for Hamar to host additional events.&lt;ref name=fairytale /&gt; LOOC approved the construction of Vikingskipet in on 15 December 1989 and at the same time supported proposals to renovate Storhamar Ishall to host Olympic ice hockey matches. A second, temporary training rink was also planned built in Hamar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uendret kostnadsramme for Lillehammer-OL, tautrekking ventes på høyt plan |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |last=Mathisen |first=Pål |date=15 December 1989  |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=– Står fast på 6,4 mrd. |work=[[Aftenposten]] |language=Norwegian |last=Larsen |first=Gunnar Tore |last2= Kirkebøen |first2=Stein |last3=Fagerli |first3=Hans Petter |date=16 December 1989 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Hamar venue would be used for short track speed skating, while figure skating would be run in Lillehammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Skøyte-komite anbefaler kortbane-løp på Hamar, kunstløp i Håkons Hall |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |last=Mathisen |first=Pål |date=10 January 1990 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, the plans were changed, so Hamar would receive an all-new ice rink in addition to a renovation of Storhamar Ishall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ishockeypresident:&amp;nbsp;– Trist og glad! |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Siem |first=Kjetil |authorlink=Kjetil Siem |date=22 March 1990 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financing of the venue was officially granted by the [[Parliament of Norway]] in April 1990.&lt;ref&gt;LOOC (III): 57&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Skating Union]] wanted to locate all skating in Hamar, and in October 1990, LOOC confirmed that they would reallocate the events so that all the all skating events would take place in Hamar, and that a separate Olympic Village would be built in Hamar for skaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=OL-kunstløp til Hamar? |last=Larsen |first=Gunnar Tore |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=9 October 1990 |page=35 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plans for the Olympic Amphitheatre called for a capacity for 4,500 and construction to cost NOK&amp;nbsp;65. By June 1991, LOOC decided to increase the size of the venue, as IOC would only allow the venue host figure skating if its spectator capacity was raised to 6,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hamar Ishall blir større og dyrere |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=18 June 1991 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financing of the expansion was granted in August, with the cost rising to NOK&amp;nbsp;83.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hamar får OL-kunstløp |last=Gravdal |first=Gunn |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=6 August 1991 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early plans called for the venue to be built in concrete, but a research project coordinated by the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] made it possible to cover the venue's exterior and interior in wood panel. This solution was hailed as aesthetical by architects, and as a technical innovation by the Norwegian construction industry.&lt;ref name=mesterverk&gt;{{cite news |title=Det "lille" mesterverk på Hamar |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Gravdal |first=Gunn |date=10 November 1992 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contract to build the venue was awarded to Martin M. Bakken, a local contractor, and construction started in August 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Byggestart for det siste OL-anlegget |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=5 August 1991 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[laminated wood]] beams for the roof were delivered by [[Moelven Industrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ny OL-kontrakt til Moelven |last=Gravdal |first=Gunn |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=19 August 1992 |page=23 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena was formerly known as '''Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre''' ({{lang-no|Hamar OL-Amfi}} or {{lang|no|Hamar Olympiske Amfi}}) until October 2015, when [[CC Stadion|CC]] bought the naming rights for the arena. A new media cube was also installed as part of the deal.&lt;ref name=newname&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.no/2015/10/06/cc-kjoper-hallnavnet-og-ny-kube/ |title=CC kjøper hallnavnet, og ny kube! |work=[[Sil.no]] |last= |first= |date=6 October 2015 |page= |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjacent to the Olympic venue lays '''Storhamar Ishall'''. Solely used for ice hockey, it opened in 1981 and has a capacity for 1,200. Since the opening of the Olympic venue, Storhamar Ishall has been used for training, and the two rinks share common dressing rooms and other facilities.

The sport of ice hockey was taken up by [[Storhamar IL]] after the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] in [[Oslo]] spurred the public interest in the sport. The pitch used by the club for summer sports was iced for the winter and surrounded with {{convert|15|cm|sp=us|adj=on}} tall wooden boards. As the club established an ice hockey section in 1955 it received funding from the [[Norwegian Ice Hockey Federation]] to purchase {{convert|120|cm|sp=us|adj=on}} tall boards. The pitch was renovated for NOK&amp;nbsp;4,000 in 1957, financed through a municipal grant. Among the upgrades was insulation of the club house, which was a barracks stemming from the [[Second World War]]. A contractor who had a storage facility close by, kept receiving visits from juveniles who jumped the fence and took material for the work. He eventually visited the club house and supplied them with a key to the facility, somewhat involuntarily becoming the club's first sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;Gjerdåker (1998): 221&lt;/ref&gt;

Storhamar traditionally played ice hockey on natural ice. In 1977, the club was promoted to the First Division, where the regulations required that the team play on [[artificial ice]]. To avoid having to play all their games [[road (sport)|on the road]], the municipality agreed to finance an outdoor artificial rink at Storhamar. With the increased attendance and interest for hockey following the town's team playing in the top league, Storhamar started planning an indoor venue.&lt;ref name=g224&gt;Gjerdåker (1998): 224&lt;/ref&gt;

State grants and a municipal guarantee were secured in 1980, with construction starting in the fall.&lt;ref name=g224 /&gt; The arena was built around the existing artificial rink.&lt;ref name=ishallene&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragons.no/klubben/ishallene/ |title=Ishallene |author=[[Storhamar Dragons]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63sGyazkF?url=http://www.dragons.no/klubben/ishallene/ |archivedate=12 December 2011 |accessdate=12 December 2011 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the hall could not be completed in time for the 1980–81 season, Storhamar was permitted to play the season in the Second Division.&lt;ref name=g224 /&gt; Storhamar Ishall became the [[list of indoor ice rinks in Norway|11th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway]]&lt;ref name=rinklist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockey.no/t2.asp?p=61305 |title=Ishaller |author=[[Norwegian Ice Hockey Association]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706024852/http://www.hockey.no/t2.asp?p=61305 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |accessdate=7 February 2011 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; when it opened in August 1981.&lt;ref name=ishallene /&gt; The venue was to be partially financed through renting it out during the summer, including to an annual town fair. These ideas fell through and the municipality was forced to take over the venue.&lt;ref name=g224 /&gt;

==Facilities==
The twin areas are located at [[Storhamar]], a residential area west of the town center of Hamar.&lt;ref name=mesterverk /&gt; Similar to Vikingskipet, the venue has two official names, Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre and Nordlyshallen. The former cannot be used commercially by non-Olympic events, such as in merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Forvirring om bruk av navn på OL-arenaer |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian |date=2 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venue is owned by the municipally owned entity called Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, which also owns and operates Vikingskipet. The operating deficits are covered by a post-Olympic capital fund, which in the case of the two Hamar venues was NOK&amp;nbsp;60 million. Only the interest of these funds is used to operate the facilities, unlike Lillehammer and Gjøvik which also derive fundings from their base capital. Owing to the fund, Hamar Municipality does not need to give municipal grants to operate the facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hamar bruker ikke én krone på OL-anleggene |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Larsen |first=Gunnar Tore |date=20 November 1998 |page=46 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre is oval and has wood as the main construction material, both for the interior and the exterior.&lt;ref name=hals&gt;Hals (1999): 28&lt;/ref&gt; Overall it is {{convert|95|m|sp=us}} long, {{convert|75|m|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|22|m|sp=us}} tall.&lt;ref name=looc59&gt;LOOC (III): 59&lt;/ref&gt; Architect Ola Mowè of [[HRTB]] chose the shape to connect various spatial designs and types of buildings in the neighborhood. The dark color was chosen to counteract the otherwise lively array of colors in the surroundings. The roof was built using laminated wood [[lattice girder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrtb.no/prosjekter/ku_hamar.html |title=Hamar Olympiske Amfi |author=[[HRBT]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63sLGnPD4?url=http://www.hrtb.no/prosjekter/ku_hamar.html |archivedate=12 December 2011 |accessdate=12 December 2011 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest beam span is {{convert|70|m|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=looc59 /&gt; The exterior walls are clad with boards, panels and decorative [[molding (decorative)|molding]].&lt;ref name=hals /&gt; The interior wall are covered with [[pine]] panel.&lt;ref name=mesterverk /&gt;

===Ice hockey===
The Olympic Amphitheatre is the home venue of Storhamar Hockey, formerly known as the [[Storhamar Dragons]], the ice hockey division of [[Storhamar IL]]. The clubs' youth groups train in Storhamar Ishall, which is also used by the club's [[bandy]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.h-a.no/Sport/Storhamar/tabid/96/Default.aspx?articleView=true&amp;ModuleId=140091 |title=Vurderer håndball i ishallen |work=[[Hamar Dagblad]] |year=1999 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63sYPT1Bt?url=http://www.h-a.no/Sport/Storhamar/tabid/96/Default.aspx?articleView=true&amp;ModuleId=140091 |archivedate=12 December 2011 |accessdate=12 December 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dragons have played continuously in the [[GET-ligaen|Elite League]] since the 1982–83 season.

Since 2001, Hamar Olympic Amphitreatre has hosted the annual [[Idrettsgallaen]], a television show that honors the past year's Norwegian sports and athlete achievements. Hamar was selected to host the event because its main sponsor, the national lottery company [[Norsk Tipping]], has its head office in Hamar. Idrettsgallaen is held in early January, when many of winter sports athletes are home and the summer athletes are off season. In 2010, Idrettsgallaen was hosted in Lillehammer because the weekend crashed with the [[2010 European Speed Skating Championships]] in Vikingskipet and Hamar lacks sufficient hotel capacity to host both simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsanalyse.no/wip4/idrettsgallaen-2010-lillehammer/d.epl?id=428796 |title=Idrettsgallaen 2010 til Lillehammer |date=3 April 2009 |last=Unaas |first=Erik |work=Sportsanalyse |accessdate=31 March 2011 |archivedate=10 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310084726/http://www.sportsanalyse.no/wip4/idrettsgallaen-2010-lillehammer/d.epl?id=428796 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerts hosted at the arena since the opening concert with [[Fats Domino]] on 25 November 1992&lt;ref name=firstpuck /&gt; include [[Little Richard]] in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Little Richard til Hamar |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=28 September 1992 |page=36 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vamp (band)|Vamp]] in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vestlandsfanen |last=Johnsen |first=Lars West |last2=Tostrup |first2=Ivan |work=[[Dagsavisen]] |date=19 November 2005 |page=34 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willie Nelson]] in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Willie Nelson til Norge |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=22 December 2007 |page=8 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[José Carreras]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Opera-sanger José Carreras under ein konsert i Hamar OL-Amfi søndag |work=[[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|Vårt Land]] |date=23 July 2010 |page=8 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The helmet is designed to allow air to flow through for a more comfortable feel for the hitter. It was previewed during the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2005 All-Star Game]] before being put into regular use. The new helmet was worn by eight teams ([[Chicago Cubs]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Anaheim Angels]], [[New York Mets]], [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], [[Atlanta Braves]], and [[Baltimore Orioles]]) in 2006 and is now available to all 30 MLB Clubs since 2007.

'''''Cricket''''', also called '''''Cricket (Hearts and Wickets)''''', is a short musical written by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]]. It was commissioned for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]]'s 60th birthday celebration, and was first performed at [[Windsor Castle]] on 18 June 1986.

Several of the tunes from the show were later used for ''[[Aspects of Love]]'', so the work was dropped from public performance or recording.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webspace.webring.com/people/oc/camillofan/cricket/musical.html ''Cricket'' – The Musical] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727062109/http://webspace.webring.com/people/oc/camillofan/cricket/musical.html |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=citron355&gt;Citron, Stephen.

==History==
After their collaboration on ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' in 1978, composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and lyricist [[Tim Rice]] took what was originally intended to be a temporary break from their illustrious theatrical partnership. They did not work together again until the request for this ''pièce d'occasion'' came up, and ''Cricket'' ended up being their final original musical.

[[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]], the Queen's youngest son, commissioned a short musical from Lloyd Webber and Rice for his mother's 60th birthday celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Snelson, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RRFx7fFsi0AC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=%22a+commission+from+Prince+Edward,+The+Queen's+youngest+son%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PsqDT7etIImriAKar4WABg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20commission%20from%20Prince%20Edward%2C%20The%20Queen's%20youngest%20son%22&amp;f=false ''Andrew Lloyd Webber'']. Yale University Press, 2009. p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The game of [[cricket]] was Tim Rice's favourite pastime – he had a cricket field on the grounds of his home and had his own cricket team&lt;ref&gt;Citron, Stephen. ''Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical.'' Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; – and Rice had a particular passion for this new comic musical about England's national sport. Rice used actual cricket-related names for his characters, boosting the light-hearted feeling of the piece. He and Lloyd Webber created a 25-minute tongue-in-cheek "musicalette" for the Queen.

''Cricket'' is entirely [[sung-through]], with no spoken dialogue.

==Summary==
Set against the backdrop of the semi-fictional [[Headingley Stadium#Headingley_Carnegie_Cricket_Ground|Headingley Cricket Club]]'s matches, the comic and slightly melodramatic plot of ''Cricket'' has star player Donald torn between his team and his girlfriend Emma – as she decides to abandon watching cricket for what appears to be a far more exciting life at the race track with the caddish Vincent.

The leads in the cast are Donald, Emma, Emma's father, Vincent, and a West Indian [[Fast bowling|fast-bowler]] from the opposing team named Winston B. Packer. The musical's chorus are the rest of the cricket players.

==Synopsis==
The show begins during a match of Headingley Cricket Club. The game is watched by the Earl of Headingley, his daughter Emma Kirkstall-Lane, and Vincent St. Leger. The Earl and the cricketers sing the praises of cricket. ("The Summer Game")

Emma intends to marry Headingley player Donald Hobbs. And at the moment, even though he is Emma's father, the Earl is more approving of Donald than of Emma, because he feels his daughter is not supportive enough of Donald's cricketing. Emma loves Donald, but she thinks he neglects her somewhat for his cricket playing, and she wants more time together. She feels that she will be forever secondary in Donald's eyes until he retires from cricket. ("As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By")

Vincent, who is devoted to horse races, overhears Emma, and offers his own rather self-interested solution: leaving for the races in lieu of the cricket match. Emma is reluctant at first, but decides that maybe Vincent is right, and runs off with him. ("The Sport of Kings") The opposing team's [[Fast bowling|fast bowler]], Winston B. Packer, sings about how wonderful it is to be able to hit batsmen when they miss – and he injures several batsmen during the course of the song. ("The Art of Bowling")

While Donald is batting, he sees Emma leave with Vincent. He's hurt and truly torn – does he stay and bat to help his team win and lose Emma, or does he leave and try to get her back? In the end, sportsmanship prevails: Donald cannot let his team down. But he has been hit a few times during the song, and is suddenly levelled. As he lies dazed on the ground, lines from various people and various moments of the game bombard him – Winston, Emma, Vincent, his team. ("All I Ask of Life")

During the tea interval, Emma returns, dejected, feeling Vincent has deceived her. Not only has she lost all of her money, but she has lost Donald as well. She blames herself, and doesn't see how anyone will ever love her again. ("Fools Like Me")

Donald and the cricketers return to the game after the interval, but Donald ignores Emma. The Earl, however, lets fly at Emma and Vincent. Because of Emma's gambling debts, the Earl has lost his reputation and is in financial distress. Vincent tries to speak, but the Earl turns his attention, and wrath, onto him. The Earl is a powerful member of the [[Jockey Club]], and bans Vincent from all racing events for life. Vincent turns to Emma for sympathy, but she accuses him of deceiving her and getting her into trouble with her father. ("A Ban for Life")

Vincent and Emma's conversation is cut off by a scream. Wittering has been injured and can no longer continue in the game. Headingley CC needs 10 more runs to win, but there is no one to take Wittering's place alongside Donald. The Earl laments the bad day for Headingley. ("Wittering's Final Innings") Vincent suddenly speaks up and says he will take Wittering's place. ("The Making of St. Leger") He joins Donald and the game continues – to the amazement of the cricketers, who believed Vincent had no redeeming qualities. Vincent is beaten up badly during the game, but keeps playing.

Donald's and Vincent's scores win the game and they are both proclaimed heroes. The Earl is so impressed by Vincent's bravery (and recovery of a vital match!) that he withdraws the horse-racing ban. And Donald tells Emma he will play less cricket and spend more time with her. She wonders, could they go to the horse races? Vincent says he will spend Sundays playing cricket. Winston vows to try [[Spin bowling|slow bowling]]. And to top it all off, Wittering is feeling better. ("The Final Stand")

Donald and Emma finish making up, and vow to stay together with a sweeping love ballad which ends in a crescendo that everyone joins into, proclaiming the triumph of the cricket metaphor for life and love. ("One Hot Afternoon")

==Productions==
The show debuted as planned on 18 June 1986 at Windsor Castle, directed by [[Trevor Nunn]] and starring [[Ian Charleson]], [[Sarah Payne (actor)|Sarah Payne]], and [[John Savident]]. The musicians were members of [[Colosseum II]] and others – the ensemble that had first performed Lloyd Webber's ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]''. The men's vocal group [[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]] played the cricketers' chorus.

The Windsor Castle performance was quite spirited and amusing, and was very well received. Two more performances followed. One was at Lloyd Webber's [[Sydmonton Festival]] on 15 July 1986. The last performance was in November 1986 at Tim Rice's favourite charity, the [[Lord's Taverners|Lord's Taverners Ball]], where Rice played the cricketer Wittering, dressed in his own Heartaches Cricket Club&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heartaches.co.uk/ Heartaches Cricket Club]&lt;/ref&gt; uniform.

A segment of the original rehearsals of ''Cricket'' was televised on the Andrew Lloyd Webber instalment of ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', which aired on 15 November 1986. The segment featured Sarah Payne and Alvin Stardust rehearsing "As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By" and "The Sport of Kings".

There have been no further performances of the musical.

==Original cast==

*[[Ian Charleson]] – Donald Hobbs, devoted cricketer for Headingley Cricket Club
*[[Sarah Payne (actor)|Sarah Payne]] – Emma Kirkstall-Lane, Donald's girlfriend
*[[John Savident]] – the Earl of Headingley, Emma's father, the solicitous patron of the Headingley Cricket Club, and a Steward of the [[Jockey Club]]
*[[Alvin Stardust]] – Vincent St. Leger, a caddish fellow who spends his time betting at horse races
*[[George Harris (actor)|George Harris]] – Winston B. Packer, a lethal [[fast bowling|fast bowler]] originally from the [[West Indies]]
*[[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]] – Chorus of cricketers
*[[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|HRH Prince Edward]] – Wittering, the gallant last [[batsman]] for Headingley Cricket Club

==After 1986==
Lloyd Webber used at least five of the tunes from ''Cricket'' in his musical ''[[Aspects of Love]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name=citron355 /&gt; This meant that ''Cricket'', which had been extremely well received, was a dead item, a fact that greatly distressed Tim Rice. The piece could thus never be expanded into a full theatrical musical.&lt;ref name=citron355 /&gt; Lloyd Webber used other tunes from ''Cricket'' in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.

The ''Cricket'' libretto was published in '''A Breathless Hush ...': The MCC Anthology of Cricket Verse'' (2004). ''Cricket'' has not been recorded for commercial release, although a non-commercial instrumental demo studio album was recorded on solo piano in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://castalbumcollector.com/recordings/6803 ''Cricket'' demo recording] at CastAlbumCollector.com&lt;/ref&gt; The performance rights for the piece have not yet been made available.

The men's vocal group [[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]] recorded "The Summer Game", featuring [[Tim Rice]] singing as the Earl, on their 2011 CD ''Songs of Cricket''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B005BAKU3Q ''Songs of Cricket''] – CD by [[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gannochy trust''' is a Scottish [[Scottish charity|charity]] with a preference for projects in [[Perth and Kinross]]. The trust was founded in 1937 by influential [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] business man [[Arthur Kinmond Bell]], known as A. K. Bell, of [[Arthur Bell &amp; Sons Ltd]].

==History==
The Gannochy Trust was founded in 1937, by the established whisky distiller and philanthropist [[AK Bell|A. K. Bell]].&lt;ref name="Welsh2011"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Welsh| first = Andrew | title = Perth good cause Gannochy Trust's 75th anniversary| work = Daily Record| date = 9 December 2011|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/perth-good-cause-gannochy-trusts-2732979 |accessdate = 12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding aims of the project were to maintain the Gannochy Housing estate, built by A. K. Bell, and to continue to improve [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] and the surrounding area for the local citizens into the future. Initially this was funded from shares in [[Bell's whisky|Bell's Whisky]], gifted to the trust by their founder.&lt;ref name="Bell and Trust"&gt;{{cite web|title=A K Bell and the Gannochy Trust|url=http://www.gannochytrust.org.uk/index.php?page=a-k-bell|website=GannochyTrust|publisher=Gannochy Trust|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The Trust funds many activities in [[Scotland]], with a preference for [[Perth and Kinross]], through awarding grants to what it feels are worthwhile causes. It has four over-arching themes with grant applications expected to meet at least one of the following aims, although the third and fourth will only be accepted for projects within Perth and Kinross:&lt;ref name="Grant Directory"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Directory of Grant Making Trusts - 2012/13|date=2012|publisher=Directory of Social Change|location=London|isbn=978-1-906294-56-4|edition=22nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Inspiring young people
* Improving the quality of life for disadvantaged and vulnerable people
* Supporting and developing amenities for communities
* Caring for the natural and man made environments

The Gannochy trust particularly provides many grants for the improvement of sports provision and participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Sportscotland page for Gannochy Trust| url =http://www.sportscotland.org.uk/funding/Funding_finder/Gannochy_Trust| date = 29 October 2012| accessdate = 12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with the original [[Trust instrument|Trust Deed]], the trust also manages and rents property in the Gannochy area of Perth. This includes an estate of rented homes, a mixture of general and sheltered housing, as well as a small number of farms. The trust also manage the nearby Doo'cot Cricket Park, and Quarrymill park, as places for community recreation.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2012 {{ndash}} pp53-56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==

To help meet the goals stated above, the Trust has helped form a number of charitable partnerships, often in conjunction with [[Perth and Kinross Council]], to help it distribute funds to where they are needed while maintaining its charitable status.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2012 {{ndash}} p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first such partnership was Bell’s Sports Centre (Perth) Ltd set up to run the sports centre built by the Trust.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2012 {{ndash}} p66&lt;/ref&gt; Now known as Live Active Leisure Ltd, this body has grown to include many recreational venues across the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.liveactive.co.uk/our-background|website=Live Active|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later partnership was the Perth and Kinross Countryside Trust, which helps maintain the rural walkways and other amenities meeting the objectives of caring for the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Partners |url=http://www.pkct.org/our-story/partners |website=Perth &amp; Kinross Countryside Trust |accessdate=1 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808041504/http://www.pkct.org/our-story/partners |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another such partnership is the Perth and Kinross Heritage Trust, which conserves the archaeological and architectural heritage of Perth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011-2012 Annual Report |url=http://www.pkht.org.uk/perch/resources/pkht-annual-report-2011-12.pdf |website=Perth and Kinross Heritage Trust |accessdate=1 August 2014 |location=Perth |page=2 |year=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806172128/http://www.pkht.org.uk/perch/resources/pkht-annual-report-2011-12.pdf |archivedate=6 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable projects==

===Within Perthshire===

In line with A K Bell's intentions, the Gannochy Trust has played a large role in the development of modern day Perth, and it has been noted that many of the landmarks visible to visitors today are a result of the support of the Trust.&lt;ref name="Perth's_tribute"&gt;{{cite news||title=Perth's Tribute to A. K. Bell extract made available at RootsWeb|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SANDEMAN/2004-10/1097742672|accessdate=16 July 2014|work=Courier and Advertiser|agency=Courier and Advertiser|date=4 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first major projects for the trust was the construction of the Bell's Sports Center in Perth, announced in December 1964 and construction starting in March 1967 with the Gannochy Trust providing £225,000 towards the costs of construction.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2012 {{ndash}} pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; The center opened in 1968.&lt;ref name= BriefHistory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Tim|title=A Brief History of Perth| url=http://www.localhistories.org/perth.html |website=localhistories.org|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also provided funding for refurbishments and extensions in 1972 and 1982, with the newly extended center being renamed the Gannochy Sports Complex, although the Bell's Sports Center is still the most commonly used name for the complex.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2012 {{ndash}} p65&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust has also supported the [[Perth Theatre]] and recently helped secure £14.5 million in funding for a two-year refurbishment project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Two-year closure during £14.5m Perth Theatre transformation| work = [[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]] |location=Dundee, Scotland | date = 21 August 2013| url = http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/perth-kinross/two-year-closure-during-14-5m-perth-theatre-transformation-1.122496| accessdate = 12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project was scheduled to start in the summer of 2014 and is expected to be completed by spring 2017 with the intention of restoring and extending the Edwardian building to better serve the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowson|first1=Alison|title=Perth Theatre redevelopment starts this summer|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/perth-theatre-redevelopment-starts-summer-3457485|accessdate=1 August 2014|work=Daily Record|date=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 it was announced that Perth's a new multi-million pound library would be named the A K Bell Library. This was both in recognition of the fact that the Gannochy Trust was a major contributor to this project, as well as the large role they, and their founder A K Bell, have made to the City since its foundation.&lt;ref name="Perth's_tribute" /&gt; The library was formally opened in 1995.&lt;ref name=BriefHistory /&gt;

===Within the rest of Scotland===

In 1967, as part of the construction of [[Stirling University]], the Gannochy Trust provided up to £100,000 towards a sports pavilion on the campus. They have continued to support sport at the university, including funding sports bursaries in 1983, and contributing £500,000 to the Scottish National Tennis Centre in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2012 {{ndash}} p75&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2003 and 2010, The Gannochy Trust sponsored the Gannochy Trust Innovation Award, awarded in by the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. This highly prestigious award was awarded to an individual in Scotland under the age of 45 in recognition of outstanding achievement which had resulted in a major economic or social benefit to Scotland or the wider world.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2012 {{ndash}} p76&lt;/ref&gt; This award consisted of a gold medal and £50,000 to develop the idea, and it is believed the £600,000 awarded has created £4 million of additional value to the Scottish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Gannochy Trust Innovation Award| publisher = The Royal Society of Edinburgh| date = |url = http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/806_TheGannochyTrustInnovationAward.html| accessdate = 13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gyumri City Stadium''' ({{lang-hy|Գյումրիի քաղաքային մարզադաշտ}}) is an [[all-seater stadium|all-seater]] [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Gyumri]], [[Armenia]]. It is currently the home venue of the [[Armenian Premier League]] club [[FC Shirak]] of Gyumri. The capacity of the stadium is 2,844 seats, excluding the standing section at the southern end of the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.football365.am/wp/?p=5535 | script-title=hy:Գյումրին պատրաստ է ընդունել ֆուտբոլային տոնը  | date = 2012-04-21 | publisher = Ֆուտբոլ 365 | accessdate = July 7, 2012|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The stadium was built and opened in 1924 to become the first stadium in the modern history of Armenia. When [[FC Shirak|Shirak]] was founded in 1958, the stadium became the regular home ground of the team for the [[Soviet First League]] competition. Starting from 1991, the stadium witnessed many glorious moments of FC Shirak in the [[Armenian Premier League]] and the [[Armenian Independence Cup]]. The stadium hosted the [[2011–12 Armenian Cup]] final match when Shirak defeated [[Impulse FC|Impulse]] to win the title for the first time in their history.
[[File:Gyumri city stadium after renovation.jpg|thumb|left|The main stand]]
The venue was reconstructed in 1999 and turned into an all-seater stadium. The total capacity of the stadium became 2,844 seats (1,413 at the western stand and 1,431 at the eastern stand). 

During 2012, the playing pitch and many other facilities were entirely renovated to meet the [[UEFA]] standards.

As of 2014, the stadium is the home ground of Shirak for the domestic competitions since 1958. However, after the most recent developments in 2012, the stadium was permitted to be used by the club for their home games at the European competitions.

On 12 July 2012, Shirak hosted [[FK Rudar Pljevlja|Rudar Pljevlja]] at the Gyumri City Stadium, in the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round|qualifying phase]] of the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League]]. The match ended in a 1-1 draw, allowing FC Shirak to advance with a 2-1 win on aggregate.

'''Holloway Field''' is home to the [[Windsor Royals]] baseball club in [[Newmarket, Queensland]], Australia. It is regarded as the home of baseball in [[Brisbane]].{{by whom|date=December 2011}}

==Background==
After the formation of the Windsor Royals in 1955, the club looked for a permanent site to play baseball. Originally, Crosby Park in [[Albion, Queensland|Albion]] was planned to be the new ground for the Royals, but was rejected by the [[Brisbane City Council]]. In 1964, the club was approved to break ground for a stadium at Spencer Park in Newmarket. On 10 May 1964, the ground was officially named Holloway Field after the Windsor foundation and life member, Stan Holloway. It was expanded and renovated in 1986 and is expected to be refurbished in the near future{{when|date=December 2011}} to accommodate the Brisbane-based team in the newly formed [[Australian Baseball League]] starting in 2010.

The field itself is a fully fenced and regulation size field with covered sunken dugouts, two bullpens, two battery cages, two officials' boxes, a scorers' box and seating for 1500. [[Floodlights (sport)|Floodlighting]] was added on 24 September 1982 and a sprinkler system two years later. It is currently{{when|date=December 2011}} the training camp of the Netherlands national baseball team and has hosted a variety of international baseball matches, including the World Master Games. It is the home ground of the [[Queensland Rams]] for [[Claxton Shield]] games and the newly formed [[Australian Baseball League]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J.O (2009). ''Queensland Baseball 1905-1990''. p357&lt;/ref&gt;

With the arrival of the [[Brisbane Bandits]] for the 2013-14 season also came upgrades to the ballpark. A new brick backstop, new backstop netting, seating added to the tiered grandstands as well as a refurbished infield. A progressive replacement plan for the lighting towers was implemented to bring Holloway Field up to the highest standard for night games. After the completion of the [[Major League Baseball]] Opening Series at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in 2014, the foul poles that were fabricated for the event were relocated to Brisbane and erected at Holloway Field prior to the [[2014–15 Australian Baseball League season]].

[[File:Carlton interchange bench.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] interchange bench in a match against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], 2011.]]
'''Interchange''' (or, colloquially, the bench or interchange bench) is a team position in [[Australian rules football]], consisting of players who are part of the selected team but are not currently on the field of play.

==Interchange numbers==
===AFL===
As of the 2016 season, at AFL level, each team is permitted four interchange players, and a maximum of ninety total player interchanges during a game.&lt;ref name="2016changes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-03/sub-rule-abolished-interchange-cap-reduced|title=Sub rule abolished, interchange cap reduced|author=Peter Ryan|date=3 September 2015|publisher=Australian Football League|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players have no limit to the number of times they may individually be changed, and an interchange can occur at any time during the game, including during gameplay.

The four players named on the interchange bench in the teamsheet, which is submitted ninety minutes before the commencement of the game, must be the four interchange players who start on the bench, however they may be substituted immediately if the coach wishes.

===Other leagues===
Interchange rules are not uniform across all leagues. In the major state leagues, as of 2016, following interchange numbers are permitted:

*[[South Australian National Football League]]: three interchange players, with a maximum of fifty rotations per team per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-08/sanfl-introduces-new-out-of-bounds-rule-and-50-rotations-per-game|author=Alex Malcolm|date=8 October 2015|accessdate=18 February 2016|title=SANFL's bold new out of bounds rule and 50 rotations per game|publisher=Australian Football League}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Victorian Football League]]: five interchange players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vflfooty.com/taxonomy/term/9?page=5|title=Roosters make multitude of changes|date=22 August 2009|accessdate=10 September 2011|publisher=VFL Footy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[AFL Women's]], in which each side has 16 players on the field instead of the 18 of the men's game, five interchange players are allowed, with no limit on the number of rotations. The AFL, which operates the women's league, decided not to impose a limit on the number of rotations, as that league is contested during the main AFL's offseason in the southern summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womens.afl/game |title=AFLW 101: The Game |publisher=Australian Football League |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative teams (such as [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|State of Origin]] teams), practice and exhibition matches often feature an extended interchange bench of up to six or eight players.

===Substitutes===
At different times during the history of the sport, there have been ''substitute'' players (also known as ''reserves'') serving a function distinct from interchange players. A player who begins the game as a substitute may take no part in the game until he is substituted for another player, the latter of whom permanently leaves the field.

The substitute rule was resisted for many years, with the prevailing view in the 1910s and 1920s being that a team should be permitted only to substitute a player in the event of an injury, but that there was no way to rule against a team making a tactical substitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=News|publication-place=Adelaide, SA|title=Football council – Tied down by leagues|page=1|date=6 November 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single substitute was finally introduced by the [[Australian National Football Council]] for the 1930 season, with no restrictions on whether the substitution be used for injury or tactical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Referee|publication-place=Sydney, NSW|title=Teams of 19 players|author=Southerner|page=17|date=19 March 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second substitute was introduced in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Advocate|publication-place=Burnie, TAS|title=Teams to have two reserves to replace injured players|date=20 February 1946|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the substitutes were replaced by interchange in the 1970s. Additionally, in the AFL between 2011 and 2015, a hybrid interchange–substitution arrangement existed in which there were three interchange players and one substitute; under those rules, the substitute was required to wear a green vest until activated, and the player substituted out of the game donned a red vest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/the-afl-is-expected-to-tick-off-a-concussion-substitute-rule-today/story-e6frf9jf-1226600995854|accessdate=21 May 2013|title=The AFL signs off on new concussion substitute rule|first1=Mark|last1=Robinson|first2=Rebecca|last2=Williams|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, substitution is no longer used in the sport.

==Interchange protocol==
In front of the interchange benches is the ''interchange area'' (sometimes called the ''interchange gate''), which is a 15-metre stretch of the boundary line, roughly centred between the two teams' benches, through which all players must enter and exit the ground when being interchanged. It is marked on the boundary line with two short lines, perpendicular to the boundary, and sometimes with a slanted end. A player who interchanges outside of this area is not permitted to return for the rest of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aflcommunityclub.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Umpire_AFL/Laws_of_the_Game/AM_6967_0112_AFL_laws_of_Australian_Football_SINGLEPAGES.pdf|title=Laws of Australian Football 2012|page=20|quote=Law 7.2 (e): a Player who does not leave the Playing Surface as specified under Law 7.2 (d) is unable to re-enter the Playing Surface for the remainder of the Match}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a player leaves the ground on a stretcher, he is permitted to take the most direct route to the changerooms for medical treatment, and is still permitted to return later in the game; however, where he leaves on a stretcher, the player must wait for 20 minutes of playing time (the length of one regulation quarter) before returning. If a stretcher is brought onto the ground but the player ultimately does not need to use it, he must still wait for 20 minutes before returning.&lt;ref name="laws" /&gt;

Due to new AFL [[concussion]] rules, effective from 2011 onwards, any player suspected of suffering a concussion must come off the ground and undergo a concussion test; if found to be concussed, he is not allowed to return to the field for the remainder of the game.

A player may be forced to make an interchange by the umpire under the [[blood rule]]. If an umpire sees a player bleeding, he will call time-on at the next appropriate time, stopping play until the player has left the field and been replaced.

Where the league has a provision to do so, an interchange steward is provided to monitor interchanges.

==Policing interchanges==
===Head count===
The primary means for controlling interchanges in most leagues (but not in the AFL) is via a Head Count, currently detailed in Law 5.5 of the game. To initiate this procedure, a team captain must request a head count from the umpire. The umpire, at the opportunity, will call [[time on (Australian rules football)|time on]], and all players from both teams line will line-up in the centre of the ground to be counted by the umpires.

If either team has more players on the ground than it should, the general rule is that the team's entire score to that point of the game is cancelled (unless the offending team's score was zero at the time of the head count), and a free kick and [[50-metre penalty]] are paid to the opposing captain from the centre of the ground or the spot of the ball. Not all leagues automatically impose a cancellation of the score; in some cases – including the modern day [[Victorian Football League]]&lt;ref name="Frankston" /&gt; – the progress score at the time of the head count is recorded, and league officials meet after the game to assess whether or not to retrospectively cancel the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.org.au/Junior-News/round-9-jc-a-the-juniors.html|title=Round 9 JC &amp; the Juniors|date=2 June 2010|accessdate=10 September 2011|publisher=Northern Football League|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218050832/http://www.nfl.org.au/Junior-News/round-9-jc-a-the-juniors.html|archivedate=18 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If both teams have the correct number of players, a free kick and [[50-metre penalty]] are paid against the captain who initiated the head count; that captain may also be reported for time-wasting and [[Ejection (sports)|ordered off]] (should the rules of the league permit) if the umpire believes the captain's primary reason for calling the head count was to waste time.&lt;ref name="laws"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/portals/0/afl_docs/Laws%20of%20Football_2011.pdf|title=Laws of Australian Football|year=2011|accessdate=10 September 2011|pages=17–18|publisher=Australian Football League|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405092426/http://afl.com.au/portals/0/afl_docs/Laws%20of%20Football_2011.pdf|archivedate=5 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head counts are rare at the top levels of the sport, but occur from time to time at suburban, country and junior levels.

====Famous head counts====
The most famous head-count request occurred in the SANFL in Round 15, 1975. [[West Torrens Football Club|West Torrens]]' champion Fred Bills, playing the last of his 313 league games (having announced his retirement earlier that week) entered the field of play before [[John Cassin (footballer)|John Cassin]], who was injured and lying on a stretcher, had left it. This prompted [[West Adelaide Football Club|West Adelaide]], trailing 11.7 (73) to 12.10 (82) in the final quarter,&lt;!-- Note: Score is referenced from the report in The Advertiser; edited footage of the incident on Youtube suggests the score may have been 10.7 to 12.10 --&gt; to request a head count.&lt;ref name="adcount"&gt;{{citation|newspaper=The Advertiser|date=11 August 1975|title=Fred fades out in confusion|page=16|publication-place=Adelaide|first=Geoff|last=Kingston}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Torrens players ran for the boundary line, while West Adelaide players wrestled with them to keep them in bounds; in the chaos, one player, identified in the match report published in ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' as [[Norm Dare]],{{Ref|1|Note 1}}&lt;ref name="adcount" /&gt; managed to leap the fence and hide under a supporter's coat to avoid detection from the umpire. Ultimately, the count was abandoned when it became impossible to vouch for who was on the field at the time of the request, and West Torrens went on to win by three goals. The incident was celebrated as one of the sport's 150 greatest moments in the 150th year celebrations in 2008.&lt;ref name="aflcount"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carltonfc.com.au/tabid/4311/default.aspx?newsid=56241|date=13 March 2008|title=Moment #82: Out for the count|accessdate=10 September 2011|publisher=Carlton Football Club}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other most famous head count occurred during the Grand Final of the 2018 [[North East Australian Football League]] season between [[Southport Australian Football Club|Southport]] and [[Sydney Swans#Reserves team|Sydney reserves]]. Southport was leading by ten goals at three-quarter time, but accidentally sent nineteen men onto the field to start the final quarter; Sydney called for a head count twenty seconds later, and Southport's extra man was discovered. Sydney received a free kick and fifty metre penalty, but NEAFL officials decided not to annul Southport's score, citing a provision within the laws of the game which allowed the full penalty not to be applied if the breach had no material impact on the game. Southport went on to win the game by 55 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2018-09-16/player-count-needed-in-dramatic-neafl-decider|title=Player count drama in SANFL, NEAFL finals|author=Ben Collins|date=17 September 2018|accessdate=17 September 2018|publisher=Australian Football League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been only three head counts, all unsuccessful, in the history of the [[VFL/AFL]]:
*by {{AFL Stk}} captain [[Wels Eicke]] against {{AFL Car}} [[1924 VFL season#Round 12|Round 12, 1924]];
*by {{AFL Ess}} captain [[Jack Clarke (Australian footballer, born 1933)|Jack Clarke]] against {{AFL Nor}} in [[1958 VFL season#Round 17|Round 17, 1958]];
*by {{AFL WCE}} captain [[Guy McKenna]] against St Kilda in [[1999 AFL season#Round 22|Round 22, 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footystats.freeservers.com/Special/1999review.html|title=1999 Review|year=1999|accessdate=10 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927103855/http://footystats.freeservers.com/Special/1999review.html|archive-date=27 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interchange infringement penalties===
In [[2008 AFL season#Round 6|Round 6, 2008]], {{AFL Nor}} and {{AFL Syd}} played a controversial drawn match, in which a bungled interchange late in the game left Sydney with 19 men on the field for about a minute, during which time the Swans scored the game-tying behind. Although the AFL's laws allowed for each of the Sydney players to be fined $2500 for the error, there could be no change to the match result because North Melbourne had not called for a head count.

This highlighted the impracticality of the head count rule, which had existed since the days before interchanges or substitutions were allowed, with a modern professional league with its rapid use of interchanges for fatigue management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/afl-to-change-bench-laws/story-e6frf9jf-1111116212567|first=Jon|last=Ralph|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=10 September 2011|publisher=Herald Sun|title=AFL to change bench laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks after this incident, the AFL introduced a new rule allowing the interchange steward to inform the umpires of interchange errors: specifically, when a player enters the field before the player he is replacing has left the field, or when a player is interchanged without using the interchange gate.

In each case, the penalty is a free kick in the centre of the ground or at the spot of the ball at the time, whichever is the greater penalty against the offending team. If the offending team is not in possession of the ball, the umpire shall impose an additional [[50-metre penalty]] against them.

in the case of a player not using the interchange gate, this penalty replaces the previous rule that the player would not be permitted to return.

Any score or free kicks given to the opposition when an interchange infringement has occurred are cancelled.

This process is seen only at the professional AFL level; lower levels of the sport still rely on the head count rule to police interchanges. AFL captains retain the right to call for a head count if they believe an interchange infringement has not been detected by the interchange steward, but this has not yet been exercised under the new rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/portals/0/afl_docs/afl_hq/policies/new%20interchange%20procedures%2008.pdf|title=New Interchange Procedures 2008|year=2008|accessdate=10 September 2011|publisher=Australian Football League|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020191526/http://www.afl.com.au/portals/0/afl_docs/afl_hq/policies/new%20interchange%20procedures%2008.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical interchange rules and tactics==
The number of interchanges allowed has followed the following time-line under [[Australian National Football Council]] (ANFC) rules:
*Prior to 1930 &amp;ndash; there was no means for either substitution or interchange. A team played with 17 on the field (19 prior to 1899) if a player was injured.
*1930 &amp;ndash; the introduction of a single substitute
*1946 &amp;ndash; the introduction of a second substitute
*1978 &amp;ndash; the replacement of two substitutes with two interchanges

Following the disbandment of the ANFC, the following timeline indicates changes to interchange rules in the AFL. Other leagues have not followed this timeline:
*1994 &amp;ndash; the introduction of a third interchange, and introduction of forced interchange under the [[blood rule]]
*1998 &amp;ndash; the introduction of a fourth interchange
*2011 &amp;ndash; the replacement of four interchanges with three interchanges and a substitute
*2013 &amp;ndash; the introduction of forced interchange for concussed players, with the provision for temporary activation of the substitute while a concussion test is conducted
*2014 &amp;ndash; the addition of an interchange cap, limiting teams to 120 interchanges per game
*From 2016 &amp;ndash; the return to four interchanges without a substitute, reduction of the interchange cap to 90 per game&lt;ref name="2016changes" /&gt;

Historically, the interchange bench was used sparingly, and mostly to take poor-performing or players who were injured and unable to continue out of the game. There was a marked change in this at the top level as professionalism grew in the sport between 2000–2010, and the interchange bench began to be used much more frequently as a means of rotating players to manage player fatigue through the game and offer rest periods for hard working players and game time for young/old players. The average number of interchanges in the AFL doubled between 2007 (56 changes per team per game) and 2010 (113 changes per team per game) as coaches sought to give frequent rests to their running players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/rotations-sending-football-into-spin/story-e6frg7mf-1225847176355|title=Rotations sending football into a spin|first=Greg|last=Denham|date=30 March 2010|accessdate=10 September 2011|publisher=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Footnotes==
:&lt;small&gt;1.{{note|1}} In the AFL's own account of the incident, as published on its website as part of the 150th-anniversary celebrations, the leap over the fence was credited not to [[Norm Dare]], but to Gerry Noonan – who, like Dare, was a former Fitzroy player in the VFL who transferred to West Torrens in 1975. Additionally, the AFL's account of the incident had one other significant factual difference to the account in ''The Advertiser'': the AFL's account indicated that the match was Fred Bills' 300th match, but the account in ''The Advertiser'' makes it unequivocally clear that it was Bills' 313th and final match.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Kindrick Legion Field''' is a [[baseball park]] located in [[Helena, Montana]] which serves as the home field of three [[American Legion Baseball|American Legion teams]]: the Senators, Reps, and Independents. It was previously the home ballpark of the [[Helena Brewers]] [[Minor League Baseball]] team who left after the 2018 season. The stadium was built in 1932 and holds 2,100 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kindrick Field: Ballpark|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20130222&amp;content_id=41895424&amp;sid=t433&amp;vkey=team1|website=Helena Brewers|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly called Legion Park, and later Memorial Park Field, the name of the ballpark was changed in the mid-1970s to Kindrick Legion Field in honor of longtime American Legion supporter Ace Kindrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Synness|first1=Curt|title=Kindrick Legion Field History|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20130222&amp;content_id=41895288&amp;sid=t433&amp;vkey=team1|website=Helena Brewers|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City officials are considering the best future use for the field after the departure of the Helena Brewers: continue with just American Legion ball or seek to add a team from the [[Collegiate summer baseball|collegiate summer]] [[Expedition League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Spedden |first1=Zach |title=Kindrick Legion Field's Future Debated |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/07/06/kindrick-legion-fields-future-debated/ |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications |date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Competition of Horsemen''' ({{lang-is|Landsmót hestamanna}}) is a [[sport|sporting event]] for [[horse racing]] and [[Animal husbandry|breeding]] [[exhibition]] of [[Icelandic horse]]s in [[Iceland]].  The event was first held 6 June 1950 at [[Þingvellir]] by the [[Icelandic Equestrian Association]] which was founded in December the year before for the purpose of running the event.  In the beginning the event was held every 4 years but since 1995 it was held every 2 years. In 2001 operational changes took place and the event is now annual and run by Landsmót hestamanna ehf, a company owned by the Icelandic Equestrian Association and the [[Farmers' Association of Iceland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9549">The [[National Dodgeball League]] (NDL) '''rules''' were created to standardize [[professional]] [[dodgeball]] matches to make them fair and consistent. All NDL sanctioned [[amateur]], [[college]], and [[youth]] events abide exclusively by NDL rules. The rules are subject to modification at the sole discretion of the NDL to accommodate and respond to the ever evolving game of [[dodgeball]].

==Court==
[[Image:NDL court diagram.png|thumb|Official NDL court diagram]]
The official dimensions for a regulation court are as follows:

The court is divided into two {{convert|30|ft|m}} by {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} areas, with a {{convert|4|ft|m}} by {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} neutral zone located at center court separating the two sides, an attack line located parallel and {{convert|10|ft|m}} from the center line, for a total court length of {{convert|60|ft|m}} from endline to endline, and a total width of {{convert|30|ft|m}} from sideline to sideline.

Approximately {{convert|2|ft|m}} to {{convert|3|ft|m}} should be allotted for an out of bounds area, allowing officials to move freely along the sidelines.

The Queue for each team is a {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} area, and should be located {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the sideline, leaving enough room for an official to move freely along the sideline.

Every effort should be made to obtain the correct dimensions. However court size may be adjusted to best suit the available space.

==Equipment==

===Stinger Division===
Six regulation size rubber balls should be used: 4 ''blockers'' ({{convert|8.5|in|cm}}) and 2 ''stingers'' ({{convert|5|in|cm}}). 
Prior to starting the game, the balls should be arranged along the center court line as follows: blocker, stinger, blocker, blocker, stinger, blocker.

===Big Ball Divisions===
Six regulation size rubber balls should be used: 6 ''blockers'' ({{convert|8.5|in|cm}}). 
Prior to starting the game, the balls should be arranged along the center court line.

===No-Sting Divisions===
Six regulation size no-sting balls (typically foam) should be used: 6 ''blockers'' ({{convert|8|in|cm}}). 
Prior to starting the game, the balls should be arranged along the center court line.

==Players==

===Teams===
Teams consist of eight players with up to two substitutes. It is normally said that all players must be in uniform.

Coed teams may consist of either gender, however at least two players of each gender must participate at the start of each game.

Open teams may consist of either gender. Any ratio of men and women may participate, including all male and all female teams.

===Substitutions===
Substitutions must be made prior to the start of the game. No substitutions can be made during a game, except in cases of injury.

===Retrievers===
Retrievers are individuals designated to retrieve balls that go out of play. Teams are responsible for providing retrievers. The number of retrievers required will be determined by the tournament director.

Teams may use players that are out as retrievers.

Retrievers may not enter the court at any time.

Retrievers may not wear jerseys of the same style as their team uniform.

Retrievers are only allowed to field balls from their side of the court.

==Matches==
A regulation match consists of a predetermined odd number of games of a single game type. The number of games and/or the time allotted may be altered to best suit time and attendance.

==Game types==

===Elimination game===
A game played until all opponents on one side have been eliminated. The first team to eliminate all its opponents is declared the winner.

===Timed game===
A game played until a predetermined time limit expires or all opponents are eliminated on one side. If time expires, all remaining players are counted. The team with most players remaining wins the game.

===Scored game===
A scored game is played as either an elimination or timed game with points awarded not for the win, but for the number of players remaining "in" at the end of each game.

==Game play==
Play begins with all players positioned behind their team's endline.

===The Rush===
The Rush occurs at the beginning of each game or reset.

Upon the official's signal, both teams rush to center court and attempt to retrieve as many balls as possible. 
A team may rush with as many or as few players as it wants, but at least one person from each team has to Rush. 
There is no limit to how many balls an individual player may retrieve.

Players may not slide or dive head first into the neutral zone or they will be called out.

Crossing over the neutral zone will result in an "out."

Players may not physically grab and pull another player across the neutral zone or prevent them from returning to their side of the court.

===Putting a ball in play===
The player and the ball must go completely behind the attack line. During the Rush, any ball retrieved from the neutral zone must be returned behind the attack line before it may be thrown at an opponent. A ball that hasn't crossed the attack line is considered a dead ball, any hits or catches are voided plays.

There are several ways to put a ball into play following a Rush:
* A player carries the ball across the attack line. 
* A player passes the ball to a teammate who is behind or carries it across the attack line. 
* A player rebounds the ball off the back wall of a closed court.

==Time Outs==
There are 2

===Outs===
A player shall be deemed "out":

* When a live ball hits any part of the player's body, clothing, or uniform. 
* If a player is hit by a live ball rebounding off another player or ball lying on the court. 
* If a defending player catches a live ball they have thrown.

Players shall return from the Queue in the order they were put "out" (i.e. first "out," first "in").

===Blocking===
Players can defend themselves by blocking the ball in flight with another ball but must retain control over the ball they are blocking with. A player dropping or losing possession of the blocking ball is deemed "out."

Any blocked ball rebounding off another ball is considered live. Any player hit by the rebounding ball is deemed "out."

===Pinching===
The act of squeezing the ball in order to alter the thrown or blocked ball is not allowed.

===Stalling===
The act of intentionally delaying the game.

If a referee determines that a player or team is stalling, the referee will warn player or team. If the stalling continues, at the referee's discretion, player or team will lose possession of all balls on their side.

If both teams are stalling a reset should occur.

===Out of Bounds Rule===
If any part of the player's body touches the endlines or far neutral zone line, the player shall be deemed "out".

Momentum may carry a player out of bounds while making a catch.  If control of the ball was established prior going out of bounds, this is NOT deemed an out.

===Neutral Zone Rule===
A player may safely step into the neutral zone but not across the centerline. Any player crossing over the centerline (located in between the two sections of the neutral zone) is deemed "out."

===Sacrifice Fly===
An airborne attack, where an attacking player may legally cross the neutral zone to hit an opponent but the ball must leave the attacker's hand before any part of the attacker's body touches the opponent's territory. If successful, the player hit is out and Attacking player remains in.

===Headshots===
A headshot occurs when a player is hit directly in the head by a high thrown ball. A high thrown ball is a ball thrown above shoulder height of the person hit in the head. Shoulder height is the height of the shoulders of the player in an upright standing position. If a player is ducking or crouching and hit in the head this will NOT be deemed a headshot as the ball was NOT thrown above shoulder height.

In tournament/events allowing headshots, any person hit on any portion of their body will be considered "out".

In tournament/events '''NOT''' allowing headshots, a player hit in the head by a high thrown ball will be deemed "safe", and any thrower committing a headshot will be deemed "out." A player raising their hands/arms to defend themselves from a headshot will not be called "out" if the ball hits their hands/arms above shoulder height in the act of defending themselves; and the thrower will be called "safe".

A player unsuccessful in their attempt to catch a high thrown ball will be deemed "out". It is the official's judgment as to whether the player is defending themselves or attempting to catch the ball.

A ball deflected by another ball, player, or object is no longer considered a high thrown ball. Should the ball strike a player in the head, that player shall be deemed "out", even if their own block deflected the ball.

==Uniforms==
Uniforms and protective equipment are considered part of the player. Any player hit on any part of their uniform or protective equipment will be considered "out". The NDL does not allow players to wear gloves, baseball caps, visors, or bandanas during play.

Each team should wear [[uniforms]] as specified in the NDL uniform guidelines.

'''Piráti Chomutov''' is a Czech [[ice hockey]] team from [[Chomutov]], [[Czech Republic]].  Established as ČSK Chomutov in 1945, the team has played in Chomutov through numerous team name changes and elevations/relegations in the [[Czechoslovak]] and Czech hockey leagues.  As of the 2015–16 season, Piráti Chomutov plays in the top-level [[Czech Extraliga]]. Their home arena is the [[SD aréna]] located in [[Chomutov]], [[Czech Republic]]

==History==
The club was established in 1945 as ČSK Chomutov.

In the 1950/1951 season, playing as Sokol Hutě, the team was promoted to the [[Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League]], where they played until the 1963/1964 season.

In 1967, as VTŽ Chomutov, the team was promoted to the highest league again but was relegated the very next year. In 1984 the club was demoted to the third level of hockey in Czechoslovak hockey, the Second National Hockey League.

In 1997, as KLH Chomutov, the club bought the license in the [[1. národní hokejová liga|First National Hockey League]] (FNHL) from [[HC Slovan Ústečtí Lvi]].

After winning the league in the 2011–12 FNHL season, Piráti Chomutov returned to the top-level league [[Czech Extraliga]]. During the play-outs in the 2013-14 season Piráti Chomutov lost and returned to the First National Hockey League. Season 2014/2015 in FNHL was one of the most successful in history. Pirati Chomutov became a winner and after play off returned to the top-level league (season 2015/2016).

==1956 airplane disaster==
On 24 November 1956, while the team was operating under the name TJ Baník Chomutov ZJF, some members of the team were involved in a fatal airplane accident. A [[Czech Airlines|Czechoslovak Airlines]] flight, on an [[Ilyushin Il-12]]B aircraft, crashed near [[Eglisau]], [[Switzerland]].  Three players, two top club officials and a reporter were among others on board the scheduled flight from [[Zurich]] to [[Prague]], which crashed in fields after an engine failure. All on board perished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://hokej.idnes.cz/cerny-den-kdysi-prozil-i-chomutov-letadlo-pohrbilo-hrace-a-vedeni-pyp-/hok_1liga.aspx?c=A110909_102817_hok_1liga_elv |title=Černý den kdysi prožil i Chomutov.

'''Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field''' is a [[stadium]] in [[East Hartford, Connecticut]]. It is primarily used for [[American football|football]] and soccer, and is the home field of the [[Connecticut Huskies football|University of Connecticut (UConn) Huskies]]. In the fall of 2010, it was home to the [[Hartford Colonials]] of the [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]]. The stadium, which opened in 2003, was the first stadium used primarily by an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-A (now FBS)]] team to open in the 21st century. The permanent stadium capacity is 40,000, consisting of 38,066 permanent seats with a standing-room area in the scoreboard plaza that can accommodate up to 1,934 people. It also has a game day capability to add approximately 2,000 temporary seats as it did for UConn
football vs. Michigan in 2013. Connecticut played on campus at [[Memorial Stadium (Storrs)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Storrs, Connecticut|Storrs]], before 2003.

[[Rentschler Field]] was originally the name of the company airfield for [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] that formerly occupied the site. The airfield, which began operations in 1931, was named after [[Frederick Rentschler]], who founded Pratt &amp; Whitney in 1925 and also founded its parent company, [[United Technologies]]. It was originally used for test flights and maintenance operations, and later for corporate aviation. The {{convert|75|acre|adj=on}} site was decommissioned as an airport in the 1990s, and donated to the state of [[Connecticut]] by United Technologies in 1999. A subsequent 65-acre donation by United Technologies in 2009 allowed for the construction of additional grass parking lots adjacent to the Stadium.

Pursuant to a lease agreement with the State, UConn plays all its home football games at Rentschler Field.

==History==
The [[New England Patriots]] considered moving to Connecticut and sharing a stadium with the UConn football team in the mid-1990s. The new stadium was supposed to be built on the [[Connecticut Convention Center]] site in downtown [[Hartford]].  However, when the Patriots completed the deal for [[Gillette Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts|Foxboro, Massachusetts]], the Hartford stadium plan was scaled down and the location was moved to [[East Hartford]]. The current capacity of 40,000 can expand to 50,000 with limited rehabilitation and has the layout and design for expansion of up to 60,000 seats in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blakesleeprestress.com/index.cfm/projects/stadiums] |Blakeslee Building Solutions&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is owned by the State of Connecticut, Office of Policy and Management, while operations are overseen by the quasi-public Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA). Global Spectrum, L.P. has managed the building on behalf of CRDA since 2013. Previously, the Stadium was managed by Bushnell Management Services (2011-2013), [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG)(2007-2011) and Madison Square Garden L.P. (2003-2007).

On July 16, 2015, it was announced that the stadium had been named Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium in a deal between [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] and UConn. The playing surface is still named Rentschler Field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courant.com/sports/uconn-football/hc-rentschler-stadiumn-pratt-naming-0717-20150716-story.html Rent Being Renamed Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium At Rentschler Field]&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Pratt and Whitney donated additional land that will be used for game day parking.

'''Product Architects Inc.''' is the parent company of Polar Bottle brand insulated sport water bottles and Half Twist lifestyle bottles.  The company is based out of [[Boulder, Colorado]] where it assembles and ships all of its products.

==History==
Robert Heiberger and Judy Amabile founded Product Architects Inc. in 1994.  The pair, along with their five employees, ran the company from the garage of their home&lt;ref name="Camera" /&gt; for a year before moving operations to an industrial park.  The business acquired its first national buyer in the form of [[The Container Store]] in April 1995&lt;ref name="Camera" /&gt; and entered the sporting goods market when they were picked up by [[Dick’s Sporting Goods]] later that year.&lt;ref name="RMN" /&gt;   Since then, the company has enjoyed steady growth and was nominated as one of Colorado’s top small businesses in 2010 by ColoradoBiz Magazine.&lt;ref name="COBiz" /&gt;  Today, Product Architects Inc. sells its products in over 50 countries across six continents and employs 38 workers.

==Products==

===Polar Bottle===
[[File:Polar Bottle® Insulated Bottles.JPG|thumb|right|From left to right: The original Polar Bottle; the addition of a removable valve and screen-printed logo (in 20- and 24-ounce sizes); the bottle redesign; and modern bottles (in 20- and 24-ounce sizes).]]
The Polar Bottle was invented by Robert Heiberger, with prototypes being made as early as 1989.&lt;ref name="Camera" /&gt;  Heiberger, a mechanical engineer working with heat loss in the medical technology design field, realized that the systems he employed to warm blood samples to body temperature could be used in reverse to keep liquid cool in a bottle.&lt;ref name="Camera" /&gt;  The bottle features a dual-wall construction which creates a layer of insulating air between the liquid inside the bottle and the outside environment.  Between the two bottle layers is a thin foil liner that reflects solar energy away from the bottle.  The bottle is – and has always been&lt;ref name="RMN" /&gt; – made from [[Bisphenol A|BPA]]- and [[Phthalate]]-free [[Low-density polyethylene]].  It is produced in 24-ounce (710 ml) and 20-ounce (590 ml) sizes.  The bottles are [[Blow molding|blow-molded]] in [[Denver, CO]].&lt;ref name="RMN" /&gt; Since the Polar Bottle’s introduction, it has undergone continual improvements&lt;ref name="Camera" /&gt; to both form and function.  The first of these changes occurred in 1998 when a removable valve system was added to the cap to facilitate cleaning.  In 2006, the bottle’s entire aesthetic was updated with a sleeker body design, the addition of a carrying strap, and the introduction of a variety of colored liners.&lt;ref name="RMN" /&gt; In 2010, the company added 8 new graphic designs to their existing array of colored liners&lt;ref name="ODUSA" /&gt; and, in response to consumer feedback, reduced the thickness of the bottle walls to make squeezing the bottle easier.&lt;ref name="BWN" /&gt;

===Half Twist===
[[File:Polar Bottle® Half Twist™ Bottles.JPG|thumb|right|Half Twist bottles in Stainless Steel and plastic (HDPE) varieties]]
The Half Twist bottle was introduced in 2010 in an effort to expand the scope of Product Architects’ hydration options beyond the sports bottle market.&lt;ref name="OIA" /&gt;  The primary feature of the bottle is the Half Twist cap, which is fitted with a silicone gasket.  The lid allows the user to drink directly from the cap without removing it from the bottle and the gasket creates a watertight seal when closed.  The Half Twist received positive reviews,&lt;ref name="SLC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FTH" /&gt; though some users found the lid difficult to operate.  The lid comes on two types of bottles: a 24-ounce (710 ml) [[High-density polyethylene]] bottle and a 28-ounce (828 ml) [[Stainless steel]] bottle.  Both bottle types are BPA- and Phthalate-free.

===Modern Wallet===
[[File:Modern Wallet.JPG|thumb|right|The “Wings” and “Prairie” Modern Wallet designs]]
Product Architects released the Modern Wallet in 2004.  The wallet was made of [[Teslin (material)|Teslin]], a synthetic material that is durable, flexible, breathable, and waterproof.  It featured a wide variety of pictures and designs that were shown on both the inside and outside of the wallet.  It was sold primarily to [[Independent Bicycle Dealers]], many of whom already carried the Polar Bottle.  The Modern Wallet was discontinued in 2008.

The '''punt kick''' is a common style of [[kicking (Australian rules football)|kicking]] in [[Australian rules football]]. It is a kick where the ball is dropped from the players' hands and kicked slightly off the longer center line of the ball before it hits the ground. It is the primary means of kicking the ball in Australian football and is similar to [[Punt (gridiron football)|punts]] used tactically in other football codes, such as [[Gridiron football|American and Canadian football]].

There are different styles of kicking depending on how the ball is held in the hand.

The most common style of kicking seen in today's game, principally because of its superior accuracy, is the drop punt, where the ball is dropped from the hands down, almost to the ground, to be kicked so that the ball rotates in a reverse end over end motion as it travels through the air. Other commonly used kicks are the torpedo punt (also known as the spiral, barrel, or screw punt), where the ball is held flatter at an angle across the body, which makes the ball spin around its long axis in the air, resulting in extra distance (similar to the traditional motion of an American football punt), and the checkside punt or "banana", kicked across the ball on the outside of the foot is used to curve the ball (towards the right if kicked off the right foot) towards targets that are on an angle. There is also the "snap", which is almost the same as a checkside punt, except that it is kicked off the inside of the foot and curves in the opposite direction. It is also possible to kick the ball so that it bounces along the ground. This is known as a grubber or dribble kick. Grubbers can bounce in a straight line, or curve to the left or right.

==Drop punt==
[[File:Punt aussie rules GFC Gnangarra.ogv|thumb|left|Video of a drop punt]]
In a drop punt the ball is held vertically, and dropped and kicked before it hits the ground, resulting in the ball spinning backwards end over end. It is the primary method of disposing the ball by foot in Australian rules football. It is considered more accurate and easier to mark than a regular punt kick, which is held flat and does not spin in the air.
In [[gridiron football]] it is referred to as a ''pooch punt'' or quick kick, a kick used by punters when the team is too far out for a field goal and too close to kick a normal punt because the ball will probably go into the end zone, losing field position in the resulting [[touchback]].  The kick has gradually replaced the less effective "[[Coffin corner (football)|coffin-corner]] kick", which was similar to [[rugby football]]'s "kicking for touch" where the object was to put the ball out of bounds near the opposition goal.  Like Australian rules football drop punts, the pooch punt requires the punter to control the distance and former Australian footballers like [[Darren Bennett (football player)|Darren Bennett]] and [[Ben Graham (footballer)|Ben Graham]] are generally credited with increasing the popularity of this kick in the [[National Football League]].

[[Jack Dyer]] is generally credited with inventing the drop punt during his playing days with the [[Richmond Football Club]]. [[Horrie Clover]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref AFL Encyc|4th|111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Collier brothers, [[Albert Collier|Albert]] and [[Harry Collier|Harry]], are also attributed with being the first to use the kick regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmondfc.com.au/news/2013-11-14/dyer-on-the-drop-punt|title=Dyer and the drop punt|publisher=richmondfc.com.au  |date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Torpedo punt==
The torpedo punt (also known as '''screw punt''' or '''spiral punt''') is the longest type of punt kick. In flight, the ball spins about its long axis, instead of end over end (like a drop punt) or not at all (like a regular punt kick). This makes the flight of the ball more [[aerodynamic]], but more difficult to catch (or [[Mark (Australian Football)|mark]] in some football codes).

In Australian rules football, the kick has become less common since the 1980s, as modern tactics have meant that accuracy has become typically more important than distance in field kicking; coaches now prefer the use of the drop punt in general field play. The kick may still be seen when a player needs additional distance or when a game is played in wet weather and forward movement by conventional methods is more difficult as a result. If kicked correctly, an Australian football can travel over 60 metres, while a normal punt will travel less distance. Australian rules footballer [[Gordon Rattray]], who played his football with the [[Fitzroy Football Club]] between 1917 and 1928, is credited as the first player to use the torpedo punt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page1722697 Fitzroy Has Never Lacked Courage, ''The Argus Weekend Magazine'', (Saturday, 6 August 1949), p.3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Checkside punt==

Also known as a 'banana kick', the checkside punt is a kicking style used in Australian rules football, rugby league and rugby union. When kicked, it bends away from the body. For the true checkside, the ball is held with ends pointing to 2 and 8 o-clock (for a right footed kick) and is kicked more off the outside of the boot with the ball spinning at an opposite direction to the swing of the leg. This enables the ball to have a greater curving effect thus opening up the face of the goals to give a larger goal face.

In the early 1890s, [[Allen Burns (Australian rules footballer)|Allen Burns]], who played Australian rules with the (then) Victorian Football Association club South Melbourne, was renowned for what seems to be an early version of the banana kick. The following is taken from newspaper reports of the match between Fitzroy and South Melbourne on Saturday 23 June 1894, that was played in showers of rain, on a very wet and slippery ground, with a very heavy and very wet leather football:
{{quotation|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A mistake by the Fitzroy backs gave Allan [sic] Burns a chance at such an angle the a goal seemed impossible, and his team were urging him not to try; but he took the shot — a forty-yards one — with the posts almost in a line, and, to everyone's amazement and the South's delight, scored a wonderful goal … &lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8679505 The Football Season: South Melbourne v. Fitzroy, ''The Argus'', (Monday, 25 June 1894), p.5.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In obtaining goals at difficult angles Burns has few rivals on the football field. He has the power of screwing the ball similar to a billiard player. His second goal on Saturday was one of the impossible shots in which it was almost a certainty that the ball would go right past, and the peculiar twist he appeared to get on as the ball darted through is one of those tricks of the game which a man should be able to patent … &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6SkRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RZEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7223%2C2895606 The Football Season: South Melbourne v. Fitzroy, ''The Age'', (Monday, 25 June 1894), p.6.]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

St Kilda Full Forward [[Bill Young (Australian rules footballer)|William (Bill) Young]] is generally thought to be the first player to use the kick in the VFL. He had been using it in the 1940's at Victorian Country Club Stratford and there is photographic evidence of him using it against Collingwood in the 1950's. Others say the kick was first popularised in [[South Australia]] in the 1960s by the [[Sturt Football Club]] coached by [[Jack Oatey]]. He himself was an exponent of the kick decades earlier in the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL). It is now one of the most common techniques for goal-kicking from a narrow angle, and more recently has been used in field kicking with deadly accuracy by players like [[James Hird]], but was most famously used by [[Peter Daicos]]. It is usually used when a [[set shot]] for goal is lined up on a narrow angle.

The '''Regina Rifles''' are a Junior B [[box lacrosse]] team based out of [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatchewan]], playing in the top league in Saskatchewan, the [[Prairie Gold Lacrosse League]]. The expansion team entered the Saskatchewan Major Box Lacrosse League (later became [[Prairie Gold Lacrosse League|PGLL]]) in 2010.

==History==
The Rifles joined the Regina Riot as the second Junior B team from Regina. The Rifles are operated and managed by the [http://www.qcmbl.ca Queen City Minor Box Lacrosse Association] in Regina. Their home arena is the [http://www.cooperatorscentre.com Co-Operators Centre].

The Rifles won their first-ever game in the [[Prairie Gold Lacrosse League]], 11-5 over the Assiniboia Attack. The first goal scored by a Rifles player was in exhibition play by Brett Kealey. The first hat trick by a Rifle player was scored by Taylor Frei, who went on to win the team goal-scoring title and the PGLL league goal scoring title during the Rifles inaugural season. The Rifles surprised the league by finishing with a .500 season and tied for fifth overall in the standings.

'''''RollerJam''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[television series]] featuring [[roller derby]] that aired on [[The Nashville Network]] (TNN, now [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]) from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482031/fullcredits|title=RollerJam (TV Series 1999–2000)|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first attempt to bring roller derby to TV since [[RollerGames]].

''RollerJam'' was derived from the original roller derby, but newer skaters used [[inline skates]] to modernize the sport (several skaters, mostly older ones, used the traditional [[quad skates]]). The program was taped at [[Universal Studios]] Stage 21 in [[Orlando, Florida]], known as ''RollerJam Arena'' and now the [[Impact Wrestling Zone]], for the first and second seasons (1999 and 2000) and the former ''[[American Gladiators]]'' arena in the show's final season. The first few weeks of the show's second season, which ran from August to October 1999, were taped at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]].

==Creation==

''RollerJam'' was the brainchild of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]-based television impresarios [[Ross K. Bagwell, Sr.]] and [[Stephen Land]]. Land, a fan of roller derby in boyhood, was inspired to bring the sport back to television by an [[obituary]] for roller derby legend [[Joan Weston]] that he had read in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in May 1997, and shared his idea with Bagwell, his mentor, who gave him a positive response.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Turczyn|first=Coury|url=http://www.popcultmag.com/obsessions/fadsandphenoms/rollerderby/derby2.html|title=Blood on the Tracks|publisher=PopCult Magazine|accessdate=2011-12-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228045852/http://www.popcultmag.com/obsessions/fadsandphenoms/rollerderby/derby2.html|archivedate=2008-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 1999 and January 2001,&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.tv.com/rollerjam/show/11373/episode_listings.html?season=0 RollerJam Episode List at TV.com] confirms there were 100 episodes, comprising four seasons, that aired between January 1999 and January 2001, plus a preview/pilot episode in December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Bagwell and Land, under the name Pageboy Entertainment, collaborated with [[CBS]] to stage this new televised revival of roller derby.&lt;!--Google reveals roughly equal numbers of references to each--&gt;

In May 1998, Bagwell and Land pitched their idea to [[The Nashville Network]] (TNN). The network agreed to air the show but wanted it ready by the new year, forcing Bagwell and Land to create a league, recruit skaters, build a track, design logos and uniforms, hire a television crew, and record the program all in a span of about seven months. In an attempt to build continuity between ''RollerJam'' and previous roller derby incarnations, Bagwell and Land hired [[Jerry Seltzer]], the son of roller derby creator [[Leo Seltzer]], to be commissioner of their new league. The first episode of the show was taped in November 1998, a week after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Overview==
''RollerJam'' featured several teams of skaters competing in the fictional World Skating League (WSL). Jerry Seltzer served as on-screen WSL commissioner, although he only made a few appearances. The initial teams, each consisting of seven men and seven women, were the New York Enforcers, California Quakes, Florida Sundogs, Nevada Hot Dice, Texas Rustlers, and Illinois Riot (the original names of the latter three teams were the Las Vegas High Rollers, Texas Twisters, and Illinois Inferno; their names were changed prior to the start of the first season). Two notable veterans from Roller Games, "Rockin'" Ray Robles and "Latin Spitfire" Patsy Delgato, were featured in the second season of ''RollerJam''. Despite strong funding and four seasons of broadcasts on TNN, the venture never became a "live" attraction. Fabricated storylines and characters in the mode of [[professional wrestling]] were being featured more than actual competitive skating around season 3 and 4, raising the ire of many skaters and fans of true roller derby.

==Rulesheets==
===Periods===

Games were played in four 6-minute periods with as many 60-second jams as possible; women skated odd numbered periods, and the men skated the even-numbered periods.  (In traditional roller derby, the game has eight 12-minute periods, again with 60-second jams.)  Jams began and ended on the referee's whistle, and a buzzer sounded to reinforce this.

===Skaters===

Whereas traditional derby employs a pivot skater, RollerJam did not use one.  Instead, each team had 3 blockers, each wearing a white helmet, and two jammers, each wearing a black helmet with red stripes.  In-line skates were legalized in attempt to modernize the sport, but certain skaters opted still to use the quad skates.

===Jams===

In seasons 1-2, the game was played like traditional derby in that the first jam began from the black start/finish line, while the skaters had to continuously skate until a time-out was called or the period ended.  In seasons 3-4, this changed to every single jam starting from a standstill start from the black line.  In either case, jammers had to start from the back of the pack (the whole group) and work their way through, with the first jammer to break out winning the status of lead jammer.  The skaters then got one point for every opponent they successfully lapped.  The lead jammer could cut off the jam early by placing their hands on their hips.

The last jam of the last period always went the full minute regardless of what the period clock showed.

===Penalties===

At the referee's discretion, skaters would sit in a [[penalty box]] for violating the rules for various reasons, from 1-2 jams, or face immediate disqualification (ejection) from the game.  Skaters frequently racked up these penalties and were willing to take it if they felt it would bring them a [[moral victory]].

===Winning===

The team with the most points won the game.  If the game was tied in regulation, originally the genders would continue to alternate in sudden death overtime periods until there was a clear winner but instead one skater from each team face-off in a Tiebreaker Match Race, 5 laps around the track and whoever crosses the finish line first wins the game for their team.

==Special Features==

In addition, special features would occasionally pop up:

:'''Half-time Match races:''' Usually played between 2 or more skaters to either settle the score with another rival skater or to compete for the "Jammer" title belt. 

Another unique concept was that Rollerjam held special games, races and competitions in certain episodes, such as:

:'''The Rollerjam All-Star game:''' Played between Company D led by Mark D'Amato and the Crazy 8's headed by Sean Atkinson, both stocked with an all-star roster of each team's key men and women skaters in the WSL. 

:'''Last Man Standing:''' A tie-breaker when both teams have equal points by the final period of and have to compete in a no time limit, no penalty game in a team variation of battle royal, to determine a winner. The objective of the tie-breaker is for skaters of both teams is to eliminate the opposing skaters by knocking them over the rails or in the infield of the track until one team wins, earning the winning team 15 points.

:'''Men and Women Demolition Derby:''' A special contest in the vein of the [[Royal Rumble]] where the WSL skaters compete in separate interval contests both assigned for male and female skaters, which starts with 3 or 4 skaters on the track. A new skater enters the track every 20 or 14 seconds in the order voted by fans at the Rollerjam website. The contest will keep going, until all the skaters, except the winner, has been eliminated by either being knocked over the rails or in the track's infield.  

:'''Table Race''' Skaters race 4 laps while avoiding crashing into the 2 tables set up on the track to evade elimination from the race. 

:'''Nightgown and Lingerie race:''' Similar to a Bra and Panties match, where the female skaters are dressed up in their outfits and must race 4 laps without getting their outfits stripped, destroyed, or get themselves knocked off the track, resulting in an elimination from the race). 

:'''Fastest man or woman on skates race:''' 5 of 1 jammer skater of each team race each other on the track, 7 laps, the first jammer crossing the finish line wins the race. 

:'''Quad Race:''' A race played between Mark D'Amato and Ray Robles, the winner keeps the quad skates, loser wears inline skates for the rest of the season.

==Actors==

Three of the most notable actors featured in ''RollerJam'' were veteran movie actor Tom Nowicki (who played WSL general manager Kenneth Loge III and Sundogs manager Leonard Loge III), Cindy Maranne (who played Amanda Hertz, the manager of the Nevada Hot Dice), former [[ESPN]] and current [[CBS Sports Network]] play-by-play commentator James Bates (who played "The Prophet", a character in Season 4 only who would interrupt games to make speeches, and later managed the Sundogs), and stage actress and former [[Mickey Mouse Club|Mouseketeer]] [[Lindsey Alley]] (who played Lisa Seltzer, the "granddaughter" of Leo Seltzer). Other characters included Julie Amazon (a bodybuilding skater in Season 4), Canine and Disable (minions of The Prophet who skated for the Sundogs, and "captured" Lindsay Francis during the first game of Season 4),Devo (a convict character who skated for the Hot Dice), Lil Nasty (A midget who is a sidekick to Tim Washington) and El Numero (A masked luchador Who skated for the Enforcers).

The most points ever scored in one jam was 28 in Period 3 of a game between the New York Enforcers and the Illinois Riot.  The Riot came back from a 20+ point deficit to win 46-43 in the highest scoring game in RollerJam history. Roller Derby legend [[Ann Calvello]], best known for her brutal feuds with [[Joan Weston]], skated a match race with Kenneth Loge III in ''RollerJam'''s finale. She emerged victorious.

==Criticism==

Ron Buffone, a producer for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), called ''RollerJam'' "That stupid roller blading show".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'' DVD, WWE Home Video&lt;/ref&gt; Buffone believed that TNN treated ''[[ECW on TNN]]'', which aired prior to ''RollerJam'' on Friday nights, as a lead-in for ''RollerJam'' rather than a show in its own right, despite the fact that the ECW broadcast generated the network's highest ratings. Nevertheless, some cross-promotion between the two programs did occur, notably when ECW wrestlers such as [[Axl Rotten]] and [[Tommy Dreamer]] appeared on ''RollerJam'' as "enforcers" for the Florida Sundogs against the New York Enforcers.

==Key players==

===Men===
*'''Sean Atkinson''', men's captain of the California Quakes. Atkinson is the first third generation skater in roller derby history.  His parents Buddy (Jr.) and Dru Atkinson and his grandparents Buddy (Sr.) and Bobbie Atkinson all skated for Leo Seltzer's original derby.  He now manages the Orlando Thunder in the [[American Roller Skating Derby]] (San Francisco Bay Bombers' league).  His younger brother, Seth, is also a skater and helps run the XSL (Xtreme Skating League), which is an independent hardcore roller derby promotion equivalent to the old ECW style of wrestling. Coincidentally, Seth is also a trained professional wrestler as well.

Would do a dance called the "White Pony" when he was out alone on a breakaway, which earned him that same nickname.
*'''Tim Washington''', the "enforcer" of the Enforcers and formerly "Titan" of the ''[[American Gladiators]]''. Nicknamed "Big Nasty". A cousin of professional boxer [[Marvin Hagler]], both he and Brian "The Blade" Gamble are now professional wrestlers.

*'''Lindsey Francis''', a skater who skated twice for the Florida Sundogs and also had stints with the Texas Rustlers and New York Enforcers.

*'''Telisa Miller''', a skater for the Texas Rustlers and New York Enforcers. Nicknamed "The Hellcat", she was one of the more violent skaters in the WSL, as she was more than willing to pull hair, scratch, claw, and get into fistfights on the banked track while with the Enforcers.

===Non-skaters===

*'''[[Jerry Seltzer]]''', real-life son of roller derby creator [[Leo Seltzer]] and original commissioner of the league.  Disillusioned with the focal point of skating competition giving way to storylines, gimmicks and fictitious characters, he quit ''RollerJam''.
*'''[[Tom Nowicki]]''', a professional actor who played WSL general manager '''Kenneth Loge III''' and his twin brother, Florida Sundogs manager '''Leonard Loge'''. Kenneth Loge was Jerry Seltzer's replacement as head of the WSL. He crusaded for morality in the sport and would not stand for outrageous behaviour on the track, actions which met obvious resistance from the skaters. His character was similar to the [[Don Callis|Cyrus]] character and [[The Network (professional wrestling)|Network]] stable in ECW.  Nowicki is best remembered as a football coach opposite [[Denzel Washington]] in ''[[Remember The Titans]]''.
*'''Jason Bates''', television sports commentator who portrayed '''The Prophet''', lackey for Kenneth Loge III, who began preaching Loge's crusade for morality.  He first appeared in the series' final season premiere sending his sidekicks "Canine" and "Disable" (known as the "Moral Authority") to kidnap newly acquired New York Enforcers female skater Lindsay Francis to make her "pure and wholesome" (similar to wrestler [[Molly Holly]]'s storyline in the WWE).  He would later acquire the Florida Sundogs and turn on Loge.  After the Enforcers defeated the Sundogs, he disappear with the league's new championship belt as the Sundogs were disbanded from the WSL.  Bates would later become announcer for [[ESPN]] and now serves as play-by-play announcer for [[CBS Sports Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssportsnetwork.com/bios/|title=CBS Sports Network Bios|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113102147/http://www.cbssportsnetwork.com/bios|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He will trade off duties during [[Arena Football League]] telecasts.
*'''[[Lindsey Alley]]''', former [[Mouseketeer]] and current stage actress who played '''Lisa Seltzer''', the "grand-daughter" of Leo Seltzer who tried to form an all-star team to travel overseas (storyline) selecting Jason McDaniel as men's captain and Stacey Blitsch as women's captain.

==Video Game==
A game based on the show was developed by BLAM! and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for the [[playstation]] The Rollerjam game made an appearance as an IGN preview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/06/rollerjam|title=RollerJam|first=I. G. N.|last=Staff|date=5 June 2000|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. according to Neoseekers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neoseeker.com/rollerjam/|title=RollerJam - Neoseeker|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the RollerJam video game was set for a release in the 2nd quarter of 2002, but contrary to IGN release date, as the game was supposed to be released on 2001. But no other trace of information came through about the game being released or canceled without a confirmation.

The video game itself became featured in Rollerjam as a feud, where the game was announced by EA's Steve Sims, around the halftime of the Nevada Hot Dice Vs. New York Enforcers game on March 21, 2000, during Rollerjams 3rd season &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country.com:80/tnn/rollerjam/front-archive/rjam-204517-f.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000612162445/http://www.country.com:80/tnn/rollerjam/front-archive/rjam-204517-f.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 June 2000|title=Roller Jam on TNN The Nashville Network|date=12 June 2000|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival attempts, failures, and legacy==
* A 1999 attempt to start a form of roller derby in the U.K called RollerBlaze&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/retro/rollerblaze/index.html|title=Roller Blaze UK|website=www.angelfire.com|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. by a small group of mountain bikers, skaters and fitness fanatics during their Summer Vacation after a trip to San Francisco inspired by RollerJam and the [[American Roller Derby League]]. Held a few unofficial derby races on a banked cycle track in London played between the Southern Blue Angels and the South Coast Sun Devils, in hope to achieve the goal of forming a small 'Brit Blaze' league and organize a 'derby' game on a more suitable indoor wooden track. Around 2000 and 2001 when Rollerjam ended, the league was disbanded.

*during the mid-2000 when Rollerjam was at its peak, Bill Griffiths, Sr., creator of the [[Roller games]] and RGI Commissioner, Wanted to bring Rollergames back under the name Rollergames 2000 (or rg2k)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollergames.com/rg2k.htm|title=ROLLERGAMES 2000|date=14 October 2000|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001014235946/http://www.rollergames.com/rg2k.htm|archivedate=14 October 2000|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but without the oversaturated mentality of Rollerjam and the 1989 version of [[rollergames]] had, instead more so in bringing back the caliber and format of play as represented in the 60's, 70's, and early 80's. But could not reach an agreement with the executives &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollergames.com/rg2kpr35.htm|title=ROLLERGAMES 2000 Update|date=21 January 2001|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010121121100/http://www.rollergames.com/rg2kpr35.htm|archivedate=21 January 2001|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Despite the ultimatum, Griffith had optimism and determination to bring back the real Roller games, but the plans were short lived as no agreements were meant. Rollergames 2000 was scrapped. And RGI continues to skate untelevised games.

*Around the time of Roller jam in 1996, a last attempt to get a proper old school roller derby on TV was made under the pilot Roller Derby USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdwlAj6U7NE&amp;t|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the National Roller Derby League, it featured  Joanie Weston at the age of 62 and Ann Calvallo at the age of 70, and other NRDL skaters. with a game played between the Las Vegas High-Rollers and the Hollywood Stars, The pilot didn't sell, it was considered "The last Jam" and that Classic Roller Derby has ended

*After Rollerjam ended and the WSL folded, Derby veteran Erwin Miller, started Rollersport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollersport.us/index.cfm|title=Rollersport - The Ultimate Derby Experience|date=9 February 2003|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030209184806/http://www.rollersport.us/index.cfm|archivedate=9 February 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 in an attempt to revive the sport of roller derby properly, acquiring Former Rollerjam skaters and potential recruits, while still using inline skates and construction of a new track. However, in 2003, complications and opposition made the plans for the revival to fall through and the Rollersport project was scrapped.

*Despite Roller Derby make a return as a slightly popular but niche contemporary sport played on flat track and banked and established under governing bodies such as [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association]] and [[Men's Roller Derby Association]], certain fans feel the ongoing modern version of the once great sport is losing its touch in gameplay, contact, and skating, contradicting what made roller derby an action-packed sport that entertained and interested many, Also too many rules, penalitys, blow out games, and slow derby strategies, are the general problem thats slowing down the game. That's when Roller derby leagues such as the [[American Roller Derby League]], [[National Roller Derby League]], and [[American Roller Skating Derby]] attempt to bring back the traditional old-school professional roller derby sport, offering an alternative to fans who are sick and tired of the mainstream modern roller derby. With the promise of fast-paced skating action, athletic skaters with personality, fights, and legitimate full-contact gameplay. With the help of a couple veteran Roller Games, Roller Derby, and Rollerjam skaters as well who also skated old timer bouts at [[Penn Jersey Roller Derby]] banked track and NRD HOF Memorial Old Timers Game and Reunions on a regulation banked track located in Lali O's Outhoummountry backyard in Vegas. But the concept was met with the opposition of a few league's owner's refusal to let go of the undefeated bias flagship team favoritism focus such as NRDL L.A. Thunderbirds and ARSD San Francisco Bay Bombers overshadowed the league's image of legitimacy, as certain skaters causing intentional trouble scaring off potential talent, and certain leagues owners could not abandon the overly fabricated predetermine format aspects of the set game, thus burning bridges with fans and the roller derby community, the leagues still continue to skate their game at venues such as the Pomona Fairplex, The Cow Palace, and Alameda Fairgrounds unstreamed and untelevised exhibition once a year still drawing in fans who enjoyed the game regardless. Years later, NRDL and roller games owner, Bill Griffiths died on April 6, 2015, and ARSD owner, Dan Ferrari died on December 14, 2016, the league's future plans are uncertain as ARSL has been disbanded.

*in 2016, Another attempt to bring back the unstaged and legit, fast-paced ultra contact, co-ed roller derby game was made under the name Rollergames: New Generation or Rollergames 2016, Only this time using the Japan [[Roller Game]] variation of roller derby gameplay, concept, and ruleset played by the Roller Game League since 1990 to today both on the banked track and flat track. with the help of Jerry Seltzer, [[Los Angeles Derby Dolls]], a few roller derby, roller games, and Rollerjam skaters, Hiroshi Koizumi Roller game Japan creator, and Daruma Entertainment. This exhibition was held at Santa Monica Pier for ROLLER EXPO 2016 and played as a world series game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY7tkpUJ5qs|title=ローラーゲーム 日米戦 2016 第一試合 第3セット Roller Games JAPAN vs USA Roller Derby|first=|last=exfittv|date=22 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHMx34YcJK4|title=ローラーゲーム 日米戦 2016 第一試合 第2セット Roller Games JAPAN vs USA Roller Derby|first=|last=exfittv|date=21 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;. with the roller games, Roller Jam, and ARSD skaters representing America and Roller game Japan skaters playing for Japan. it was marketed as the "fastest derby" with its offering of full contact, fast gameplay, and no slowing down penalties and no staged fights or set games. The exhibition was well received by its audience, with 2017 plans still to be made, but never happened, as Hiroshi Koizumi was busy training a roller derby Japan team for the [[Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports]] 2017 roller games held in Nanjing, China. As of now, Roller game is Occasionally played at the RollerXskate Arena held in Tokyo Dome City for Flat battles and X-DOME Skate Park for banked battles. highlights of These games Including the game held at Santa Monica can be seen on exfittv's YouTube channel &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/exfittv/search?query=rollergame|title=exfittv|website=YouTube|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sepang International Circuit''' ({{lang-ms|Litar Antarabangsa Sepang}}) is a [[motorsport]] [[race track]] in [[Sepang District|Sepang]], Selangor, [[Malaysia]]. It is located approximately {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} south of [[Kuala Lumpur]], and close to [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]]. It hosted the [[Formula One]] [[Malaysian Grand Prix]] between 1999 and 2017, and is also the venue for the [[Malaysian Motorcycle Grand Prix]], the [[Malaysia Merdeka Endurance Race]] and other major motorsport events.

==History==
[[File:Sepang International Circuit.JPG|thumb|left|View from Mall Area, Main Grandstand North, Lower Tier]]The circuit was designed by German designer [[Hermann Tilke]], who would subsequently design F1 venues in [[Shanghai International Circuit|Shanghai]], [[Bahrain International Circuit|Sakhir]], [[Istanbul Racing Circuit|Istanbul]], [[Valencia Street Circuit|Valencia]], [[Marina Bay Street Circuit|Marina Bay]], [[Yas Marina Circuit|Yas Marina]], [[Korean International Circuit|Yeongnam]], [[Buddh International Circuit|Greater Noida]], [[Circuit of the Americas|Austin]] and [[Baku City Circuit|Baku]].

The circuit was officially inaugurated by the 4th [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamad]] on 7 March 1999 at 20:30 [[Time in Malaysia|MST]] ([[UTC+08:00]]). He subsequently went on to inaugurate the first [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Moto GP]] [[Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix|Malaysian Grand Prix]] on 20 April 1999 (see [[1999 Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix]]) and the first [[Formula One]] [[Malaysian Grand Prix|Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix]] on 17 October 1999 (see [[1999 Malaysian Grand Prix]]).

On 23 October 2011, on the second lap of the [[MotoGP]] [[2011 Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix|Shell Advance Malaysian Grand Prix]], the Italian [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycle racer]] [[Marco Simoncelli]] died following a crash in turn 11 on Lap 2, resulting in an abandonment of the race.

In October 2016 it was mooted that the Sepang circuit may be dropped from the Formula One series due to dwindling ticket sales, and held its nineteenth and last World Championship Grand Prix in 2017.&lt;ref name="bbc.com/sport"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/37759494 |title=Malaysian Grand Prix: Sepang could leave F1 calendar over ticket sales |accessdate=25 October 2016 |publisher=www.bbc.com/sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
[[File:Sepang-international-circuit.JPG|thumb|right|Turns 2 and 3 from Mall Area, Main Grandstand South, Upper Tier]]The main circuit, normally raced in a clockwise direction, is {{convert|5.543|km|mi}} long, and is noted for its sweeping corners and wide straights.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The layout is quite unusual, with a very long back straight (927 metres) separated from the pit straight by just one very tight [[Hairpin turn|hairpin]].

Other configurations of the Sepang circuit can also be used. The north circuit is also raced in a clockwise direction. It is basically the first half of the main circuit. The course turns back towards the pit straight after turn 6 and is 2.71 kilometres long in total.

The south circuit is the other half of the racecourse. The back straight of the main circuit becomes the pit straight when the south circuit is in use, and joins onto turn 8 of the main circuit to form a [[hairpin turn]]. Also run clockwise, this circuit is 2.61&amp;nbsp;km in length.

Sepang International Circuit also features [[kart racing]] and [[motocross]] facilities.

==A lap in a Formula One car==
Sepang starts with a long pit straight where the [[Drag reduction system|DRS]] zone exists – crucial for drivers to get a good exit out of the last corner to gain as much speed as possible. Turn 1 is a very long, slow corner taken in second gear. Most drivers brake incredibly late and lose speed gradually as they file round the corner, similar to [[Shanghai International Circuit|Shanghai's]] first turn but slower. Turn 1 leads straight into Turn 2, a tight left hairpin which goes downhill quite significantly. The first two corners are quite bumpy, making it hard to put power onto the track.&lt;ref name=Malaysia&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepang Track Guide|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/02_Malaysia_72dpi.jpg|publisher=F1 Fanatic|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turn 3 is a long flat out right hander which leads into Turn 4 – known locally as the [[Langkawi]] Curve&lt;ref name=jol&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepang International Circuit|url=http://supergt.net/pages/pg:race/device:pc/ln:en/year:2012/gt_class:gt500/menu:3/circuit_id:16|publisher=Super GT|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a second gear, right-angle right-hander. Turns 5 and 6 make up an incredibly high-speed, long chicane that hurts tyres and puts a lot of stress on drivers due to high G-Force. It is locally known as the [[Genting Highlands|Genting]] Curve.&lt;ref name=jol /&gt; Turns 7 and 8 (the KLIA curve) make up a long, medium-speed, double-apex right hander, and a bump can cause the car to lose balance here.&lt;ref name=Malaysia /&gt; Turn 9 is a very slow left-hand hairpin (the Berjaya [[Pulau Tioman|Tioman]] Corner&lt;ref name=jol /&gt;), similar to turn two but uphill. Turn 10 leads into a challenging, medium-speed right hander at turn 11, requiring braking and turning simultaneously. Turn 12 is a flat-out, bumpy left which immediately leads into the flat right at turn 13, then the challenging '[[Sunway Lagoon]]'&lt;ref name=jol /&gt; curve at turn 14. Similar to turn 11, it requires hard-braking and steering at the same time. It is taken in second gear. The long back straight can be a good place for drivers to overtake as they brake hard into turn 15, a left-handed, second-geared hairpin but drivers are advised by experts to be careful not to get re-overtaken as they come into turn 1.

{{Life in the Arab League}}

The [[Arab States]] have tried to form unions of several non-political organizations. Sport has been one of the main activities used to unify Arabs. Several tournaments and games were created to let Arab participate in sports, in an effort to bring the members of the  Arab world closer to each other.

==Pan Arab Games==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Old Arab Games slogan.PNG|thumb|right|The logo of the first Pan Arab Games]] --&gt;

The [[Pan Arab Games]] were created in 1953 with a grand opening in [[Alexandria]], which hosted the first Games; the games were supposed to take place every four years, like the [[Olympic Games]]. Several political problems have made this difficult. The Games included most of the same events as the Olympics. [[Egypt]], with 985 medals over the years, is the leader in medal wins, followed by [[Syria]] with 692 medals, then [[Algeria]] with 624 medals. [[Mauritania]] and [[Comoros]] are the only two Arab States that never won a medal in the games.

==Arab Olympic Achievements==
{{Arab culture}}
In nearly 100 years of Olympic competition, the combined tally of medals won by all Arab countries is 73. At 22 countries, the Arab nations constitute almost 11 per cent of the total number of participating nations (204). However, the average number of medals won - 3.48 medals every four years - has been uninspiring. In the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, for example, Arab countries won only 10 of the 929 medals available - a little over one per cent.

===Egypt===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hassanein1924natgeog-p251-theodolite.jpg|thumb|200 px|Olympic fencer [[Ahmed Hassanein]], seen here in 1924, was also an explorer and politician.]] --&gt;
Though the modern version of the Olympic games began in 1896, it was not until 1912 that Arabs appeared on the international sporting scene. Egypt became the first Arab country to send an Olympic delegation - fencer [[Ahmed Hassanein]] - to the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]].
Sixteen years later, Egypt won its first two gold medals, in weightlifting and wrestling, and a silver and bronze in diving at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]]. Since then it has maintained its competitive edge over other Arab countries and leads the Olympic chart among Arab nations with a total of 23 medals.

In the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], Egypt sent the largest Arab delegation of more than 100 athletes competing in handball, field hockey, badminton, synchronised swimming, judo, boxing, taekwondo, athletics, fencing and the pentathlon.

===Morocco===
The [[1984 Summer Olympics]] ([[Los Angeles]]) marked a watershed moment for Arab athletics when [[Morocco]]'s [[Nawal El Moutawakel]] became the first Arab woman to win a gold medal, participating in the 400m hurdles.

Fellow countryman [[Saïd Aouita]] also brought home the gold in the 5000m men's marathon.

Moroccan talent continued to emerge as athletic sensation [[Hicham El Guerrouj]] returned from the 2004 Athens Olympics with two gold medals in the 1500m and 5000m races. Morocco is second to Egypt with 19 Olympic medals.

==Football==
Four African and four Asian members of the Arab League have qualified to the [[FIFA World Cup]]. [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] advanced to round of 16 in 1986, [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in 1994, and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in 2014. Neither team has reached quarter-finals.

The [[Union of Arab Football Associations]], established in 1974, organizes the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and [[UAFA Club Championship]].

African members of the Arab League have hosted 12 editions of the [[Africa Cup of Nations]], with another scheduled for 2017:

* [[1957 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Sudan]]
* [[1959 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Egypt]]
* [[1965 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Tunisia]]
* [[1970 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Sudan]]
* [[1974 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Egypt]]
* [[1982 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Libya]]
* [[1986 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Egypt]]
* [[1988 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Morocco]]
* [[1990 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Algeria]]
* [[1994 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Tunisia]]
* [[2004 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Tunisia]]
* [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] - [[Egypt]]

Meanwhile, Asian members of the Arab League have hosted five editions of the [[AFC Asian Cup]]:

* [[1980 AFC Asian Cup]] - [[Kuwait]]
* [[1988 AFC Asian Cup]] - [[Qatar]]
* [[1996 AFC Asian Cup]] - [[UAE]]
* [[2000 AFC Asian Cup]] - [[Lebanon]]
* [[2011 AFC Asian Cup]] - [[Doha]]
* [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]] - [[UAE]]
The [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] is scheduled to be held in Qatar.

* [[1991 All-Africa Games]] - [[Egypt]]
* [[2006 Asian Games]] - [[Doha]]
* [[2007 All-Africa Games]] - [[Algiers]]

'''Union Sportive de Biskra''', ({{Lang-ar|الإتحاد الرياضي لبسكرة}}), known as '''US Biskra''' or simply '''USB''' for short, is an [[Algeria]]n football club based in [[Biskra]]. The club was founded in 1934 founded. The club colours are green and black. Their home stadium, [[Complexe Sportif d'El Alia]], has a capacity of 15,000 spectators. The club is currently playing in the [[Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 2]].
==History==
Some of its famous players of the 1970s and early-1980s include: ''Majorie, Chaib Lakhal, Mohamed Jonas, Mirini, Bessaou, Bouzidi, Ben Brahim, and of course Doubba''.

L'USB was stock in the third division for most of its history and played major roles but never made it up. The third division used to be called "Division d'Honneur". At that time the most important achievement was defeating the then, and even now, mighty [[ES Setif]] 2–1 in Algerian cup. That was a short lived happy time followed by a loss to  [[USM Bel-Abbès]] in the same competition by 4–1. All the citizens of Biskra still remember the year of Azzaba when l'US Biskra lost at home in one of the final games to Azzaba 3–1 and therefore missing the accession to the second division then known as "Division Regional".

L'US Biskra now is in second division and even played in Division one for one season two years ago. In may 2017, US Biskra returned to the [[Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1]] after 11 years of absence.
