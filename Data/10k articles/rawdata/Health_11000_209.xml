[[Image:LA AIDS Walk 1.JPG|thumb|right|2007 [[Los Angeles, California]] AIDS Walk.]]
'''AIDS Walk''' is a [[walkathon]] [[fundraiser]] that raises money to combat the [[AIDS epidemic]].   The funds raised from AIDS Walks usually benefit a local [[AIDS service organization]] (such as [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]], [[Whitman-Walker Clinic]] or the [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]]), which provide services and [[advocacy]] for local community residents who are infected with [[HIV]].  They are also often credited for being effective tools of public [[outreach]], community empowerment, and [[education]] for the issues surrounding AIDS.

AIDS Walk fundraisers are a primarily American phenomenon because the United States has no [[nationalized]] [[healthcare system]], and the services provided by local AIDS service organizations may not be otherwise accessible to people who are HIV positive.

== About ==
===Event===
In a typical AIDS Walk, participants walk a predetermined [[thoroughfare|route]] (usually 5 or 10 kilometers long) through a city or town.  Many AIDS Walks have [[team]] programs that encourage organizations such as churches, schools, and corporations to participate together.  Many events also have opening and/or closing [[ceremonies]] which feature speeches and performances by [[celebrities]], community leaders, and [[politicians]].

===Fundraising===
[[Fundraising]] models vary from event to event, but most AIDS Walks encourage participants to raise money by collecting pledges from their friends, family, and co-workers.  Some events have a required minimum amount or registration fee, but for many events fundraising is voluntary.

===Volunteering===
An AIDS Walk event will usually be produced with the help of volunteers.  Typically, an AIDS Walk [[Volunteering|volunteer]] will assist on an assortment of projects.  Some of these projects could include: direct mailing pieces are sent out to registrants, creating fund-raising packages, phone-banking past participants and volunteers to continue their efforts, and many other tasks as needed.

On the day of the event, volunteers can number in the thousands and might perform many different (and necessary) tasks.  Volunteers might hand out refreshments to participants, cheer and direct participants along the route and throughout the AIDS Walk venue, assist lost children and other participants, assist \the event, assist with communication throughout the venue, and even escort celebrities, elected leaders and other invited guests throughout the day.

== History ==
On July 28, 1985, [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]] held the world's first AIDS Walk. Its organizers hoped to raise $100,000, that day, but a tide of 4,500 walkers rolled forward from the starting point at Paramount Studios, bringing in $673,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apla.org/facts/timeline.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729210021/http://www.apla.org/facts/timeline.html |archivedate=2010-07-29 |df= }} APLA Timeline&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support ==
Community-based activism is the cornerstone of organizing an AIDS Walk event.  Over the course of the epidemic, there have been many supporters of these events.  Celebrities, elected leaders, corporations, religious organizations and churches, schools and universities account for some of entities that have supported AIDS Walks throughout the world.

== Criticism ==
As with many charity fundraisers, critics have often questioned where the money goes and the level of transparency.

:''See also: [[Electronic health record#United States]]''

The move to [[electronic medical record]]s (EMRs) is becoming increasingly prevalent in health care delivery systems in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Garets&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Patient Records: EMRs and EHRs |url=http://www.providersedge.com/ehdocs/ehr_articles/Electronic_Patient_Records-EMRs_and_EHRs.pdf |work=Healthcare Informatics Online |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies |author1=Dave Garets |author2=Mike Davis |date=October 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714033442/http://www.providersedge.com/ehdocs/ehr_articles/Electronic_Patient_Records-EMRs_and_EHRs.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Due to the enactment of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], there has been a rise in the number of federal investments in programs that increase EMR adoption.&lt;ref name=Desroches&gt;{{cite web|title=Small, Nonteaching, And Rural Hospitals Continue To Be Slow In Adopting Electronic Health Record Systems|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2012/04/19/hlthaff.2012.0153.abstract|work=Health Affairs|author1=Catherine M. DesRoches |author2=Chantal Worzala |author3=Maulik S. Joshi |author4=Peter D. Kralovec |author5=Ashish K. Jha |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0153|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act]] portion of this stimulus law provides payments for providers that show they have reached the standard for “meaningful use”.&lt;ref name="Desroches" /&gt; This has led more hospitals to adopt EMR, though they have had different experiences in adopting electronic medical records.

There are several steps that need to be taken in order to adopt electronic medical records. 
# A supportive environment, adequate training and resources, a clear direction, and engaged people are a few things needed.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Change Management Strategies for an Effective EMR Implementation|url=http://www.himss.org/content/files/CHANGEMANAGEMENT.pdf|work=HIMSS|author1=Claire McCarthy |author2=Douglas Eastman |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# A strong leader is also necessary in order to facilitate the changing environment and using meetings and announcements as adoption promotion tactics have been shown to be useful.&lt;ref name="Silo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Electronic Health Records to Improve Quality and Efficiency: The Experiences of Leading Hospitals|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Issue%20Brief/2012/Jul/1608_SilowCarroll_using_EHRs_improve_quality.pdf|work=The Commonwealth Fund|author1=Sharon Silow-Carroll |author2=Jennifer N. Edwards |author3=Diana Rodin |date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Having the clinical staff involved is also a key feature in successfully adopting electronic medical records. Many hospitals use “physician champions,” who are essentially physicians who educate their peers on the benefits of electronic medical records.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; 
# Furthermore, the importance of quality department leaders has been stressed in order to make sure the electronic medical records system is beneficial in providing quality care.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt;
Hospitals have been using different suppliers of health data systems in order to adopt electronic medical records. The key suppliers of health data systems are [[Epic Systems]], [[Allscripts]], [[Meditech]], [[Cerner]], [[IBM]], McKesson, [[Siemens]], [[Healthland]], [[CPSI]], and [[GE Healthcare]].&lt;ref name="Freudenheim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digitizing Health Records, Before It Was Cool|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/business/epic-systems-digitizing-health-records-before-it-was-cool.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;|work=The New York Times|author =Milt Freudenheim|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision of choosing an EMR [[vendor]] like Epic or Meditech can fall on either hospital leadership or the corporate level based on the size of the system.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; If an organization only has one hospital, the hospital leaders select the vendor. If the system is larger, the decision is made at the corporate level, though several people from the hospitals remain involved.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; There are several criteria for deciding the vendor. [[Sentara Healthcare]] was able to make their selection by looking for a vendor with high outpatient care integration, technical support at all levels of integration, and one that customized a system to their needs.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt;

The length of time it takes to implement electronic medical records can vary but usually takes two to three years.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; The first stage of implementation is called “design, build, validate,” where the vendor is selected and the plans are put in place. This is followed by a “big bang” implementation, which means all the departments transfer to the system at once, due to the interconnectedness of hospitals this is necessary.

Though the adoption of electronic medical records is increasing, there is a range in the level of implementation. The [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society|HIMSS]] Analytics Database shows the eight stages of adoption in their [[United States]] EMR Adoption Model. Stage 0 implies “All three ancillaries not installed,” while in Stage 7 there is a shift to complete EMR. The EMR Adoption Model shows that in 2011, the number of acute care hospitals achieving Stage 5 or Stage 6 increased by more than 80 percent.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt; Meanwhile, the number of hospitals at Stages 0, 1, 2, and 3 has decreased. Furthermore, adoption has increased most among large hospitals and those in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Desroches" /&gt;{{clarify|reason=This part about stages had poor context. It needs to be re-written|date=September 2015}}

== Implementation ==
EMR implementation experiences among hospitals and healthcare delivery systems vary. Some systems have successful experiences, while others do not have as seamless of a transition. For example, in 2002, [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, CA]] attempted to implement a new EMR system, but the US$34 million system failed due to numerous factors. The physicians were unhappy because of the new physician order entry system for [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]], [[Medical laboratory|labs]] and procedures was more time consuming than doing the orders by hand. Physicians often found themselves spending extra time to avoid the system's warnings because there was not room for flexibility within the EMR system.&lt;ref name=Kumar&gt;{{cite web|title=Overcoming barriers to electronic medical record (EMR) implementation in the US healthcare system: A comparative study|url=http://jhi.sagepub.com/content/16/4/306.full.pdf+html|work=Health Informatics Journal|author1=Sameer Kumar |author2=Krista Aldrich |doi=10.1177/1460458210380523|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was the new system more time consuming, but it also alerted physicians with numerous electronic reminders and alerts that the physicians felt were excessive. The system was implemented with numerous decision support mechanisms, which created alerts that could not be overridden by physicians.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; This flaw was a result of not obtaining adequate physician input for the EMR system and not enough prior testing.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; These problems then made it very difficult to obtain buy-in from the physicians, which ultimately caused several hundred physicians employed at Cedars to refuse to use the system after only 3 months.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smelcer&gt;{{cite web|title=Usability of Electronic Medical Records|url=http://www.upassoc.org/upa_publications/jus/2009february/smelcer4.html|work=Journal of Usability Studies|author1=John B. Smelcer |author2=Hal Miller-Jacobs |author3=Lyle Kantrovich |date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure was not only due to technology design and inefficiencies, but also to poor training and implementation. The hospital had implemented the system with very little prior testing, and did not gradually phase in the system but rather implemented it all at once.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; There was also not full buy-in from the staff at all levels of the organization, and insufficient training to ensure that the staff was ready for implementation.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The example of failed EMR implementation at Cedars shows the complexities that health systems face in EMR implementation. However, there are numerous positive EMR experiences as well.

Both [[Geisinger Health System]] and [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]] have been cited as having successful implementations of EMR systems.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; Both of these systems utilized key strategies that ultimately led to successful implementation.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; To create success, both Geisinger and NY Presbyterian utilized clinical teams to develop the EMR system, and therefore gained staff and physician buy-in.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; Another strategy used to reach successful implementation is for the organization to focus on training. At Geisinger, for example, the hospital provided “shadowers” for physicians and nurses throughout the day during the implementation phase.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; Then, as physicians and nurses gradually become proficient with the new system, the number of trainers needed gradually decreased. Both hospitals also clearly emphasized that training was mandatory for all staff and that all staff must pass a proficiency test before they can access the EMR system.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt; Another strategy for successful EMR implementation used by these two hospitals is to use the EMR system for performance improvement through standardized care protocols. To successfully do this, NY Presbyterian gradually utilized more hard stops{{clarify|date=September 2015}} within their protocols over time to ensure that protocols were being followed. However, these hard stops were created collaboratively to achieve physician buy-in and ensure that they were appropriate for care delivery. Allowing tailoring of the EMR system is essential to both before implementation and afterwards, and physicians and clinical staff must be used in this development process to create success.&lt;ref name="Silo" /&gt;

==Results==
Currently, there has been little research and evaluation on the post-implementation of commercial electronic medical records (EMR). MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, OH, has published an evaluation of the EpicCare EMR by Epic Systems five years after implementation. MetroHealth’s methods included a web-based survey for primary care providers to measure their level of utilization of the EpicCare EMR. The physicians surveyed were those in the internal medicine, family medicine, and the pediatric units of the hospital. Prior to the survey, physicians were given eight hours of training by consultants on how to navigate the EMR system. The survey subsequently taken showed a response rate of 35% or 59 of 154 providers. Questions included whether providers have a computer at home, whether they access EpicCare from home, and their level of expertise on using a computer. The results showed that 97% had a computer at home, while 53% accessed EpicCare from home, and 11% were computer novice, 76% intermediate, and 13% were advance users. {{clarify|text=Using a scale of 1 to 4, 87% of providers surveyed rated the EpicCare system as either good or excellent.|reason=how are "good" and "excellent" between "1" and "4"?|date=September 2015}} &lt;ref name=Kaelber&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of a Commercial Electronic Medical Record (EMR) by Primary Care Physicians 5 Years after Implementation|author1=David Kaelber |author2=Peter Greco |author3=Randall D Cebul |year=2005|pmc=1560716|volume=2005|pages=1002|journal=AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings|pmid=16779289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey showed that in terms of the overall level of satisfaction with the EMR, 6% of respondents felt that EpicCare was inferior to a paper-based system, 81% felt that it was superior, while 13% were indifferent. In the area of training, 46% of respondents felt that their training was inadequate, and 75% would like to receive additional training. The implementation of the EpicCare EMR has impacted the way physicians treated their patients as evidenced by 12% of respondents reporting that they had changed medications based on the medication alerts and 15% reporting that they followed the EMR’s best practices alerts. The survey results revealed several areas that can benefit from improvement, such as ongoing training and support as well as the optimal utilization of all EMR functions.&lt;ref name="Kaelber" /&gt;

JKL Healthcare System, a nonprofit organization that employs a 450-employee physician group and operates three acute care hospitals, implemented an EMR system in 2001. The cost of "Epic", the new system, was $35 million. Their goal is for every physician in their organization to adapt the EMR at a 100% utilization rate in order to increase efficiency and reduce adverse patient outcomes. 450 physicians were required to attend a 16-hour training session in order to obtain a certification that would allow them to admit patients. 1,700 Non-physician employees were required to attend the same training to receive their certification as well.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementation of the EPIC Electronic Medical Record/Physician Order- Entry System|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/695253/implementation_of_the_epic_electronic_medical_recordphysician_order_entry_system/|work=Journal of Healthcare Management|publisher=Health Administration Press|author =Mary S. O'Brien|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A physician survey was conducted two months after implementation which showed that out of 73 respondents, 90% of physicians felt that the Epic system made their jobs easier and more efficient. Admissions for the hospitals have risen since implementation as well as physician support, which indicated that the EMR has been implemented successfully. During the May – August 2004 period of post implementation, outpatient visits increased by 3%, medication errors were eliminated completely, and patient satisfaction surveys showed that overall satisfaction increased to their highest level since 2000. EMR utilization has saved JKL Healthcare approximately $50,000 on office supplies and has significantly reduced the number of medical records staff.&lt;ref name="O'Brien" /&gt;

The JKL Healthcare System was one of the first successful implementers of EMR using the Epic System, and they became a model site for other healthcare systems. JKL Healthcare received the Davies Award in September 2004, which is the most prestigious award in the IT industry for its implementation of the most comprehensive EMR system in the US.&lt;ref name="O'Brien" /&gt;

'''Andrija Hebrang''' ({{IPA-sh|ˈandrija ˈxebraŋk|hr}}; born 27 January 1946) is a [[Croatia]]n physician and politician. A member of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), he is a former member of the [[Croatian Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=24 Hrvatski Sabor]&lt;/ref&gt; A physician by vocation, Hebrang had served three terms as Croatia's [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Croatia)|Minister of Health]] (1990–1992, 1993–1998 and 2003–2005) and spent three months as [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Minister of Defence]] (May–October 1998) under six different Prime Ministers. In addition, he was his party's candidate in the [[Croatian presidential election, 2009–2010|2009–2010 Croatian presidential election]], eventually finishing third behind [[Ivo Josipović]] and [[Milan Bandić]], winning 12 percent of the vote in the first round.

Her parents saw to her education, and she learned to play piano, and to speak French and German.&lt;ref name="Nacional"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/en/clanak/18321/hebrangs-difficult-character-and-intolerance-will-cost-sanader-his-government |title=Hebrang's difficult character and intolerance will cost Sanader his government |date=27 January 2004 |work=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] |language=Croatian |issue=428 |accessdate=29 October 2016 |author=Berislav Jelinić |archivedate=25 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69QbOjwDH?url=http://www.nacional.hr/en/clanak/18321/hebrangs-difficult-character-and-intolerance-will-cost-sanader-his-government |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrang father joined the Communist party and fought for the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] in [[World War II]], becoming a close friend and adviser to Marshall [[Josip Broz Tito]], eventually becoming a high ranking government member. However, in the late 1940s he fell out of favor with senior Party members, was arrested for treason by the Yugoslav government, and subsequently disappeared. The date of his death and the circumstances are unknown, though it is presumed he died ca. 1949 in a Belgrade prison; the circumstances remain unclear and his body was never recovered. [[Ustaše]] killed 16 members of Hebrang family during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and another 10 members of his family have been killed by the communist regime of newly founded [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/hebrang-mogao-sam-traziti-vilu-koliko-je-mojih-ubijeno-clanak-243124| title=Hebrang: Mogao sam tražiti vilu koliko je mojih ubijeno| date=23 January 2011| work=[[Večernji list]]| language=Croatian| format=| accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Andrija, along with his mother and siblings were put under house arrest in 1948. His mother Olga was imprisoned for twelve years and the children were sent to live with their aunt Ilona in [[Zagreb]]. They lived very poorly, as Ilona's husband was sent to the prison camp at [[Goli Otok]] for several years and she was made to raise the three young children alone. Andrija saw his mother again when he was eleven and she was released from prison in 1960. The family was forced to change their surname to "Markovac" in order for Olga to find employment.&lt;ref name="Nacional"/&gt;

After finishing gymnasium, Hebrang enrolled at the [[School of Medicine, University of Zagreb]] where he received his doctorate specializing in radiology and oncology, and began teaching at the university as a professor in 1985.

He returned in 2001 as a member of the [[Croatian True Revival]] party led by [[Miroslav Tuđman]], but after talks with the new head of the HDZ [[Ivo Sanader]], he returned to the Croatian Democratic Union. After the HDZ's victory in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|Croatian parliamentary elections of 2003]], he joined Sanader's government as one of the two vice-presidents and the Minister of Health and Social Welfare from 2003-2005.

'''Chop-chop''', also known as '''loose tobacco''', is an Australian term for untaxed illegal [[tobacco]], such as that which is homegrown. The necessity of chop-chop emerged in avoidance of heavy excise and taxation levies, sharply lowering the cost compared to legally [[market (economics)|marketed]] products. The chop-chop industry is by definition illegal and unregulated.&lt;ref name="Bittoun"&gt;[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/phd-pub-tobacco-chopchop-cnt.htm www.Health.gov.au] Renée Bittoun, December 2004, ''The Medical consequences of smoking "chop-chop" tobacco'' (PDF), hosted by the Australian Government Department of Health and Aging Web site. Accessed 15 July 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602015407/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/phd-pub-tobacco-chopchop-cnt.htm |date=June 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered an inferior product by the consumer to legal tobacco in taste but attractive as its price to the consumer is considerably less.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/payav9/we-tested-four-types-of-chop-chop-so-you-can-buy-the-best&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market==
It is estimated in May 2018, that in Australia about 864 tonnes of chop-chop is sold each year &lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-butt-squad-to-chase-billions-in-criminal-tobacco-fraud-20180505-p4zdiv.html&lt;/ref&gt; which is about 40% of the total legal Australian market of tobacco of 2,150 tonnes a year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-10-tobacco-industry/10-6-retail-value-and-volume-of-the-australian-tobacco-market&lt;/ref&gt;. In the previous year the [[Australian Taxation Office]] seized 117 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-butt-squad-to-chase-billions-in-criminal-tobacco-fraud-20180505-p4zdiv.html&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the market ranges from [[KPMG]] at $1.6 billion to [[Rohan Pike Consulting]] at $3.8 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.afr.com/personal-finance/tax/governments-tobacco-tax-grab-double-atos-estimates-20180511-h0zy4u&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Health concerns==
Chop-chop is sometimes viewed as being more healthy than [[Mass production|mass-produced]] branded tobacco. Research suggests that contaminants are common and include twigs and pulp from raw cotton, hay, cabbage leaves, grass clippings and [[chloride]] products. One writer has suggested that [[mould]] and [[fungi]] are also likely to be found in chop-chop samples.&lt;ref name="Bittoun"/&gt;

Another claim is that smoking chop-chop has the potential to cause greater illness than branded tobacco {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} and possible fatality in those who use it. This is claimed, largely to the relatively high chance of fungal contamination found in samples of chop-chop. These fungi can cause toxic responses in the [[lungs]], [[liver]], [[kidneys]] and skin, with illness ranging from [[allergy|allergic]] reactions, chronic [[bronchitis]] and [[asthma]] to [[lung cancer]] or [[Legionellosis|legionnaire’s disease]]. 

==Possession==
Because of its illegal nature, chop-chop is often transported and stored in a clandestine manner.  In one 2007 incident, a taxation officer inspecting a residence in [[Mareeba, Queensland]] noticed that the owner's bedroom floor sounded hollow and discovered a hydraulically operated steel trapdoor concealing an underground bunker that held hundreds of kilograms of chop-chop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cairnspost.com.au/article/2007/08/30/3916_news.html www.CairnsPost.com.au] - Bunker Bust (also on Page 1 of [[The Cairns Post]], August 30 - 2007) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830103631/http://www.cairnspost.com.au/article/2007/08/30/3916_news.html |date=August 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chop-chop can also find its way into the market via individuals or groups who purchase leaf directly from a tobacco grower, process it for sale and provide it to a range of retailers (such as tobacconists, market stallholders, hairdressers, newsagents and milk bars) for on-selling. Chop-chop is usually sold in half or one kilogram lots, packed into clear plastic bags in loose leaf form.&lt;ref&gt;Winstanley, Margaret (2008). [http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-10-tobacco-industry/10-9-the-tobacco-industry-and-the-illegal-tobacco- 10.9.1 Chop-chop]. Tobacco in Australia. Cancer Council Victoria. Retrieved 2010-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The term "chop-chop" was coined in the mid-1890s by staff at an Australian tobacco manufacturer, [[W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills]] Australia Limited, endeavouring to combat the illegal trade. The term comes from the production process of the illicit producers - merely chopping up the cured tobacco leaves.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5210">The '''Cowboy Mafia''' was the nickname for a group of [[marijuana]] smugglers who operated in the United States during the 1970s.  At the time they were reportedly the most prolific drug smugglers in [[Texas]].  The nickname was given to the group by the Dallas media, as the capture and trial of the group created significant media coverage throughout Texas.

During 1977 and 1978 the group imported over 106 tons of marijuana. Using the shrimp boats Agnes Pauline, Monkey, Jubilee, and Bayou Blues, the group made six trips from [[Colombia]] to Texas. The group was arrested in 1978 after the federal government seized the Agnes Pauline when they were unloading their cargo in [[Port Arthur, Texas]].  In 1979, 26 members of the smuggling ring were convicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/658/f2d/279/united-states-v-hawkins-e-j 58 F. 2d 279 - United States v.

Ruppel]&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles “Muscles” Foster, a ranch foreman and the head of the operation, pleaded innocent by reason of insanity and was acquitted in 1980.

In August 1981, Rex Cauble was indicted by a [[grand jury]], as the government believed he was the financial backer of the smugglers.&lt;ref&gt;Texas millionaire indicted Associated Press The Spokesman-Review August 8, 1981 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19810808&amp;id=U_lLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=de4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4977,3161198]&lt;/ref&gt;  Foster was the foreman for his ranches and the drugs were transported to Cauble's ranches throughout Texas.  Cauble was a multi-millionaire, the former chairman of the Texas Aeronautics Commission and an honorary [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]].  He was also the owner of [[Cutter Bill]], a famous cutting horse.&lt;ref&gt;

Cauble was convicted in January 1982 on ten counts including: two counts of violating the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] statute (RICO), conspiracy to violate RICO, three violations of the [[Travel Act|Interstate Commerce Travel Act]], and four counts of misapplication of bank funds.&lt;ref&gt;Rex Cauble Convicted  Associated Press January 29, 1982 Victoria Advocate [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19820129&amp;id=hbhdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B14NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5515,5804320]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guilty Verdict Shocks Cowboy Drug Smuggler United Press International January 29, 1982  The Bryan Times [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&amp;dat=19820129&amp;id=4p9PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u1EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3984,2408690]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/31/weekinreview/headliners-the-long-voyage-home.html The Long Voyage Home  New York Times January 31, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;706 F.2d 1322: United States of America, Plaintiff-appellee, v.

As a result of the RICO conviction, Cauble forfeited his 31% interest in Cauble Enterprises.  This included interests in: two Cutter Bill Western World stores, three Texas banks (Western State Bank in Denton, Dallas International Bank and South Main Bank of Houston), six ranches, a welding supply company, and oil and gas holdings.  The company's worth was estimated at $80 million.  However, the government sold their interest back to the other partners (Cauble's wife and son) for an estimated $12 million.

'''Deirdre Barrett''', Ph.D. is an author and psychologist who teaches at [[Harvard Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/display/person/39720 |title=Harvard Catalyst Profiles |publisher=Harvard College |date= |accessdate=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is known for her research on [[dream]]s, [[hypnosis]] and imagery and has written on [[evolutionary psychology]]. Barrett is a Past President of The International Association for the Study of Dreams and of the [[American Psychological Association]]’s Div. 30, The Society for Psychological Hypnosis. She has written four books for the general public: ''[[The Pregnant Man and Other Cases From a Hypnotherapist's Couch]]'' (1998), ''[[The Committee of Sleep]]'' (2001), ''[[Waistland]]'' (2007), and ''[[Supernormal Stimuli]]'' (2010). She is the editor of four academic books: ''[[Trauma and Dreams]]'' (1996), ''The New Science of Dreaming'' (2007), "Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy" (2010), and "The Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams." (2012).  She is Editor in Chief of the journal ''Dreaming: The Journal of the Association for the Study of Dreams'' and a Consulting Editor for ''Imagination, Cognition, and Personality'' and ''The International Journal for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis''.

==Research==
Barrett is best known for her work on dreams and their contributions to creativity and objective problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/1152884251.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+29%2C+2006&amp;author=&amp;desc=Four+Experts+Try+to+Get+Inside+Readers%27+Heads. THE WASHINGTON POST; Four Experts Try to Get Inside Readers' Heads Oct 29, 2006; M.4]&lt;/ref&gt; She interviewed modern artists and scientists about their use of their dreams, documenting dramatic anecdotes including [[Nobel Prizes]] and [[MacArthur Foundation]] '[[genius grant]]s' whose ideas originated in dreams.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812932412 Barrett, Deirdre. The Committee of Sleep: How Artists, Scientists, and Athletes Use their Dreams for Creative Problem Solving—and How You Can Too. NY: Crown Books/Random House, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;  She also conducted research asking college students to incubate answers to real-life homework and other objective problems on which they were working, finding that in one week’s time, half had dreamed about their topic and half of those had a dream which provided an answer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asdreams.org/journal/articles/barrett3-2.htm Barrett, Deirdre. The 'Committee of Sleep': A Study of Dream Incubation for Problem Solving. Dreaming: Journal of the Association for the Study of Dreams, 1993, 3, pp. 115-123.]&lt;/ref&gt; Barrett describes dreaming as simply “thinking in different biochemical state”&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ojvXAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:Deirdre+inauthor:Barrett Barrett, Deirdre.

The New Science of Dreaming, Volume III: Cultural and Theoretical Perspectives on Dreaming NY, NY: Praeger/Greenwood, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; and believes we continue to work on all the same problems—personal and objective—in that state. Her research concludes that while anything—math, musical composition, business dilemmas—may get solved during dreaming, the two areas dreams are especially likely to help are 1) anything where vivid visualization contributes to the solution, whether in artistic design or invention of 3-D technological devices and 2) any problem where the solution lies in thinking outside the box&amp;mdash;i.e. where the person is stuck because the conventional wisdom on how to approach the problem is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/61116074.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+28%2C+2000&amp;author=Don+Oldenburg&amp;desc=You%3A+Dream+a+Little+Dream--and+Pay+Attention.

Barrett’s studies of hypnosis have focused on different types of high hypnotizables, finding two subgroups which she terms fantasizers and dissociaters. Fantasizers are people who have vivid imaginations, find it easy to block out real-world stimuli, spend much time daydreaming, report imaginary companions as a child and grew up with parents who encouraged imaginary play. Dissociaters usually had a history of [[Child abuse|childhood abuse]] or other significant trauma, had learned to escape into numbness, and to forget unpleasant events. Their association to “daydreaming” was often going blank rather than vividly recalled fantasies. Both score equally high on formal scales of [[hypnotic susceptibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Deirdre.

Most recently Barrett has written on evolutionary psychology, especially the concept of [[Supernormal Stimuli|supernormal stimuli]]—the idea that technology can create an artificial object which pulls an instinct more strongly than that for which it evolved.

'''Discan''' is both a scale and a method in [[clinical psychology]]. As a scale, it is a type of ordered-metric scaling that yields a scale with internal reliability, and scale-points in excess of the number of initial anchors, more than would be the case with the Likert scale, though not as many as are achieved by the Analog scale. In [[Louis Thurstone]]'s tradition, it is scored by paired-comparisons. Seeking optimality, it is a compromise between the competing merits and demerits of the Likert scale and the Analog scale. 

With the Discan method, four descriptive anchor-levels yield 14 scale-points, or three levels produce ten. 

It was originated, for use in clinical psychology, by [[M.B. Shapiro]].

'''Distilled water''' is [[water]] that has been boiled into vapor and condensed back into liquid in a separate container. Impurities in the original water that do not boil below or at the boiling point of water remain in the original container. Thus, distilled water is one type of [[purified water]].

==History==
Drinking water has been distilled from sea water since at least about AD 200, when the process was clearly described by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]].&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/00033794500201451 | issn = 0003-3790 | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | page = 186 | last = Taylor | first = F. Sherwood | authorlink = F. Sherwood Taylor | title = The Evolution of the Still | journal = Annals of Science | year = 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its history predates this, as a passage in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Meteorologica]]'' (II.3, 358b16) refers to the distillation of water.&lt;ref name="Meteorology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/meteorology/book2.html|title=Meteorology – Book II|accessdate=2010-06-14|publisher=The University of Adelaide|author=Aristotle|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426031024/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/meteorology/book2.html|archivedate=2010-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Israel Williams of the [[Friendship of Salem#Friendship .281797.29|''Friendship'' (1797)]] improvised a way to distill water, which he described in his journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028839152/cu31924028839152_djvu.txt|title=The old shipmasters of Salem|last=Trow|first=Charles Edward|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|year=1905|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=178ff|chapter=Chapter XVI|oclc=4669778|quote=Short of Fresh Water Causes Alarm — Captain Williams's Invention to Make Salt Water Fresh — His 'Still' Described by him}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In chemical and biological laboratories, as well as in industry, cheaper alternatives such as [[DI water|deionised water]] are preferred to distilled water.{{Citation needed|reason=Deionized water is not cheaper than distilled water.|date=April 2018}} But if these alternatives are not pure enough, distilled water is used. If exceptionally high purity water is required, [[double distilled water]] is used.

In general, non-purified water could cause or interfere with chemical reactions as well as leave mineral deposits after boiling away. One method of removing impurities from water and other fluids is [[distillation]].

For example, [[ions]] commonly found in tap water would drastically reduce lifespans of [[Lead–acid battery|lead–acid batteries]] used in cars and trucks. These ions are not acceptable in automotive cooling systems because they corrode internal engine components and deplete typical [[antifreeze]] anti-corrosion additives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100701012047/http://www.hazardouswaste.utah.gov/SWBranch/Adobe/P2Factsheets/AntifreezeRecyclingFactSheet.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Any non-volatile or mineral components in water are left behind when the water evaporates or boils away. Water escaping as steam, for example from a boiler of heating system or steam engine, leaves behind any dissolved materials leading to mineral deposits known as [[Glossary of boiler terms|boiler scale]].
[[File:Steam water distiller.JPG|thumb|A boiling water distiller. Boiling tank on top and holding tank on the bottom.]] Low-volume humidifiers such as cigar [[humidor]]s can use distilled water to avoid mineral deposits.

Certain biological applications require controlled impurities, especially in experiments. For example, distilling water to be added to an [[aquarium]] would remove known and unknown non-volatile contaminates. It should be noted that living things require specific minerals; adding distilled water to an ecosystem, such as an aquarium, would reduce the concentration of these minerals. Fish and other living things that have evolved to survive in lakes and oceans should be expected to thrive at mineral ranges found in their original habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/caep/r3/docs/basic-aquarium-set-up.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923214044/http://www.dfg.ca.gov/caep/r3/docs/basic-aquarium-set-up.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controlled impurities as well as equipment reliability are critically important in medical applications where, for example, distilled water is used in Constant Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machines to humidify air for breathing. Distilled water will not leave contaminants behind when the humidifier in the CPAP machine evaporates the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distilled Water And CPAP Usage|url=http://www.cpap.com/cpap-faq/Humidifiers.html#why-do-i-need-to-use-distilled-water-with-in-my-humidifier-chamber|publisher=cpap.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705042850/http://www.cpap.com/cpap-faq/Humidifiers.html#why-do-i-need-to-use-distilled-water-with-in-my-humidifier-chamber|archivedate=2014-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpap.com/cpap-faq/Humidifiers.html#why-do-i-need-to-use-distilled-water-with-in-my-humidifier-chamber|title=CPAP Humidifier Frequently Asked Questions - CPAP.com|work=cpap.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705042850/http://www.cpap.com/cpap-faq/Humidifiers.html#why-do-i-need-to-use-distilled-water-with-in-my-humidifier-chamber|archivedate=2014-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible for brewers to blend distilled water with hard water to mimic the soft waters of Pilsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtobrew.com/section3/chapter15-1.html|title=How to Brew - By John Palmer - Reading a Water Report|work=howtobrew.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005195150/http://www.howtobrew.com/section3/chapter15-1.html|archivedate=2009-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application was to increase the density of the air to assist early airplane jet engines during takeoff in "hot and high" atmospheric conditions, as was used on the early [[Boeing 707]].&lt;ref&gt;Down the Susquehanna to the Chesapeake By John H. Brubaker, Jack Brubaker page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in steam irons===
Although possibly once the recommended procedure, using distilled water in [[Ironing|steam iron]]s for pressing clothes (once thought to help reduce mineral build-up and increase iron life),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeinstitute.com/steam-iron-buying-guide.htm|title=Steam Iron Buying Guide|work=homeinstitute.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129093005/http://www.homeinstitute.com/steam-iron-buying-guide.htm|archivedate=2011-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is no longer necessary. Most manufacturers now say that distilled water is unnecessary in their irons, and can also cause malfunction, including spitting and leaking during use. Distilled water is capable of being heated ''beyond'' the normal [[boiling point]] due to absence of dissolved impurities which provide [[nucleating]] points ''at'' the normal boiling point. It has been suggested that this [[Superheating|superheated (distilled) water]] in an iron will flash boil when disturbed (as with moving an iron), and cause the iron to spit, leak, and possibly scald the user.

However, this information is speculative.  No trials are present that would show that the non-chemical nature of distilled water would have any meaningful effect on the production of steam that a slight adjustment in the iron's temperature control could not remedy.

==Equipment to distill water==
[[File:Double Distilled Water Unit.jpg|thumb|Typical laboratory distillation unit]]

Until World War II, distilling sea water to produce fresh water was time-consuming and expensive in fuel. The saying was: "It takes one gallon of fuel to make one gallon of fresh water."{{cn|date=August 2018}} Shortly before the war, Dr. R.V. Kleinschmidt developed a compression still, which became known as the Kleinschmidt Still, for extracting fresh water from sea water or contaminated water. By compressing the steam produced by boiling water, 175 gallons of fresh water could be extracted from sea water for every gallon of fuel used. During World War II this equipment became standard on Allied ships and on trailer mounts for armies. This method was in widespread use in ships and portable water distilling units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2yADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=popular+science+February+1946#v=onepage&amp;q=popular%20science%20February%201946&amp;f=true|title=Popular Science|publisher=|author1=Corporation|first1=Bonnier|date=February 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the latter half of the century. Modern vessels now use [[Flash evaporation|flash-type evaporators]] to boil sea water, heating the water to between 70-80&amp;nbsp;°C and evaporating the water in a vacuum; this is then collected as condensation before being stored.

[[Solar still]]s can be relatively simple to design and build, with very cheap materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefarm.org/charities/i4at/surv/sstill.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819050013/http://www.thefarm.org/charities/i4at/surv/sstill.htm |archivedate=2009-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drinking distilled water ==
Bottled distilled water can usually be found in supermarkets or pharmacies, and home water distillers are available as well. Water purification, such as distillation, is especially important in regions where water resources or tap water is not suitable for ingesting without boiling or chemical treatment.

Municipal water supplies almost always contain trace components at levels which are regulated to be safe for consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm |title=Drinking Water Contaminants |work=water.epa.gov |year=2011 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202094944/http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm |archivedate=February 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewg.org/tap-water/home |title=EWG's Drinking Water Quality Analysis and Tap Water Database &amp;#124; Environmental Working Group |work=ewg.org |year=2011 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025022939/http://www.ewg.org/tap-water/home |archivedate=October 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other components such as trace levels of [[aluminium]] may result from the treatment process (see [[Water purification#Additional treatment options|water purification]]). [[Fluoride]] and other ions are not removed through conventional water filter treatments. However, distillation eliminates most impurities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anjaneyulu|first=L.|author2=Kumar, E. Arun |author3=Sankannavar, Ravi |author4= Rao, K.

==Health effects==
Distillation removes all minerals from water, and the [[Membrane technology|membrane methods]] of [[reverse osmosis]] and [[nanofiltration]] remove most, or virtually all, minerals. This results in demineralised water, which has not been proven to be healthier than [[drinking water]]. The [[World Health Organization]] investigated the health effects of demineralised water in 1982, and its experiments in humans found that demineralised water increased [[diuresis]] and the elimination of [[electrolyte]]s, with decreased serum potassium concentration. [[Magnesium]], [[calcium]], and other nutrients in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L with 20–30&amp;nbsp;mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L minimum and a 40–80&amp;nbsp;mg/L optimum, and a total water hardness (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2–4&amp;nbsp;[[mmol/L]]. At water hardness above 5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, higher incidence of [[gallstone]]s, [[kidney stone]]s, [[urinary stone]]s, [[arthrosis]], and [[arthropathy|arthropathies]] have been observed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} For fluoride the concentration recommended for dental health is 0.5–1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L, with a maximum guideline value of 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/L to avoid [[dental fluorosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nutrients in Drinking Water|isbn=92-4-159398-9|publisher=World Health Organization|author=Kozisek F|chapter=Health risks from drinking demineralised water|year=1980|pages=148–59|chapterurl=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientsindw.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218180835/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientsindw.pdf|archivedate=2016-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water filtration and distillation devices are becoming increasingly common in households. Municipal water supplies often have minerals added or have trace impurities at levels which are regulated to be safe for consumption. Much of these additional impurities, such as [[volatile organic compounds]], [[fluoride]], and an estimated 75,000+ other chemical compounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watersystems.walton.com/|title=Walton International - Home|publisher=Watersystems.walton.com|date=2010-11-05|accessdate=2011-12-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904210320/http://watersystems.walton.com/|archivedate=2014-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drinkmorewater.com/technology/technology/ |title=Our Technology - Purification Technology |publisher=Drinkmorewater.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106170706/http://www.drinkmorewater.com/technology/technology/ |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeenvironmentcenter.com/10stage.htm |title=10 Stage Water Purification Process |date=7 February 2001 |work=archive.org |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010207205656/http://www.homeenvironmentcenter.com/10stage.htm |archivedate= 7 February 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are not removed through conventional filtration; however, distillation and reverse osmosis eliminate nearly all of these impurities.

The drinking of purified water as a replacement for drinking water has been both advocated and discouraged for health reasons. Purified water lacks minerals and ions such as calcium that play key roles in biological functions such as in nervous system [[homeostasis]], and are normally found in potable water. The lack of naturally occurring minerals in distilled water has raised some concerns. The ''Journal of General Internal Medicine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Azoulay A, Garzon P, Eisenberg MJ |year=2001|title=Comparison of the mineral content of tap water and bottled waters|journal=J Gen Intern Med|volume=16 |issue=3|pages=168–75|pmid=11318912|pmc=1495189|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2001.04189.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a study on the mineral contents of different waters available in the US. The study found that "drinking water sources available to North Americans may contain high levels of [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], and [[sodium]] and may provide clinically important portions of the recommended dietary intake of these minerals". It encouraged people to "check the mineral content of their drinking water, whether tap or bottled, and choose water most appropriate for their needs". Since distilled water is devoid of minerals, mineral intake through diet is needed to maintain good health.

The consumption of [[hard water|"hard" water]] (water with minerals) is associated with beneficial cardiovascular effects. As noted in the ''American Journal of Epidemiology'', consumption of hard drinking water is negatively correlated with atherosclerotic [[heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Voors|first=A.

'''Embryo transfer''' refers to a step in the process of assisted reproduction in which [[embryo]]s are placed into the [[uterus]] of a female with the intent to establish a [[pregnancy]]. This technique (which is often used in connection with [[in vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF)), may be used in humans or in animals, in which situations the goals may vary.

Embryo transfer can be done at day two or day three, or later in the [[blastocyst]] stage, which was first performed in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen J, Simons RF, Fehilly CB, Fishel SB, Edwards RG, Hewitt J, Rowlant GF, Steptoe PC, Webster JM | title = Birth after replacement of hatching blastocyst cryopreserved at expanded blastocyst stage | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8429 | pages = 647 | date = March 1985 | pmid = 2857991 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(85)92194-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fresh versus frozen ==
Embryos can be either “fresh” from fertilized egg cells of the same [[menstrual cycle]], or “frozen”, that is they have been generated in a preceding cycle and undergone [[embryo cryopreservation]], and are thawed just prior to the transfer, which is then termed "frozen embryo transfer" (FET). The outcome from using cryopreserved embryos has uniformly been positive with no increase in birth defects or development abnormalities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givf.com/fertility/embryofreezing.cfm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121206043620/http://www.givf.com/fertility/embryofreezing.shtml |archive-date=6 December 2012 |title=Genetics &amp; IVF Institute |publisher=Givf.com |deadurl=yes |access-date=22 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; also between fresh versus frozen eggs used for [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI).&lt;ref name=Wennerholm2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wennerholm UB, Söderström-Anttila V, Bergh C, Aittomäki K, Hazekamp J, Nygren KG, Selbing A, Loft A | title = Children born after cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes: a systematic review of outcome data | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 24 | issue = 9 | pages = 2158–72 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19458318 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humrep/dep125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[pregnancy rate]]s are increased following FET, and perinatal outcomes are less affected, compared to embryo transfer in the same cycle as [[controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]] was performed.&lt;ref name="EvansHannan2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans J, Hannan NJ, Edgell TA, Vollenhoven BJ, Lutjen PJ, Osianlis T, Salamonsen LA, Rombauts LJ | title = Fresh versus frozen embryo transfer: backing clinical decisions with scientific and clinical evidence | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 808–21 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24916455 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmu027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[endometrium]] is believed to not be optimally prepared for [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] following ovarian hyperstimulation, and therefore frozen embryo transfer avails for a separate cycle to focus on optimizing the chances of successful implantation.&lt;ref name="EvansHannan2014"/&gt; Children born from [[Vitrification in cryopreservation|vitrified]] [[blastocysts]] have significantly higher [[birthweight]] than those born from non-frozen blastocysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wikland M, Hardarson T, Hillensjö T, Westin C, Westlander G, Wood M, Wennerholm UB | title = Obstetric outcomes after transfer of vitrified blastocysts | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 25 | issue = 7 | pages = 1699–707 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20472913 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/deq117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When transferring a frozen-thawed oocyte, the chance of pregnancy is essentially the same whether it is transferred in a natural cycle or one with [[ovulation induction]].&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014/&gt;

== Uterine preparation ==
In the human, the uterine lining ([[endometrium]]) needs to be appropriately prepared so that the embryo(s) can implant. In a natural cycle the embryo transfer takes place in the [[luteal phase]] at a time where the lining is appropriately undeveloped in relation to the status of the present Luteinizing Hormone. In a stimulated or a cycle where a "frozen" embryo is transferred, the recipient woman could be given first estrogen preparations (about 2 weeks), then a combination of [[oestrogen]] and [[progesterone]] so that the lining becomes receptive for the embryo. The time of receptivity is the [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation window]]. A [[scientific review]] in 2013 came to the conclusion that it is not possible to identify one method of endometrium preparation in frozen embryo transfer as being more effective than another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Groenewoud ER, Cantineau AE, Kollen BJ, Macklon NS, Cohlen BJ | title = What is the optimal means of preparing the endometrium in frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles? A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 458–70 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23820515 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited evidence also supports removal of [[cervical mucus]] before transfer.&lt;ref name=mains&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mains L, Van Voorhis BJ | title = Optimizing the technique of embryo transfer | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 785–90 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20409543 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.03.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timing ==
Embryo transfer can be performed after various durations of [[embryo culture]], conferring different stages in [[human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]]. The main stages at which embryo transfer is performed are [[human embryogenesis|cleavage stage]] (day 2 to 4 after [[co-incubation]]) or the [[blastocyst]] stage (day 5 or 6 after [[co-incubation]]).&lt;ref name="DarLazer2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dar S, Lazer T, Shah PS, Librach CL | title = Neonatal outcomes among singleton births after blastocyst versus cleavage stage embryo transfer: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 439–48 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24480786 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmu001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embryos who reach the day 3 cell stage can be tested for chromosomal or specific genetic defects prior to possible transfer by [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD). Transferring at the blastocyst stage confers a significant increase in [[live birth rate]] per transfer, but also confers a decreased number of embryos available for transfer and [[embryo cryopreservation]], so the cumulative clinical pregnancy rates are increased with cleavage stage transfer.&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farquhar C, Rishworth JR, Brown J, Nelen WL, Marjoribanks J | title = Assisted reproductive technology: an overview of Cochrane reviews | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD010537 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25532533 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010537.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26174592|date = November 2018}} Transfer day 2 instead of day 3 after fertilization has no differences in [[live birth rate]].&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014/&gt;

[[Monozygotic twinning]] is not increased after blastocyst transfer compared with [[cleavage-stage embryo]] transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Papanikolaou EG, Fatemi H, Venetis C, Donoso P, Kolibianakis E, Tournaye H, Tarlatzis B, Devroey P | title = Monozygotic twinning is not increased after single blastocyst transfer compared with single cleavage-stage embryo transfer | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 592–7 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19243755 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a significantly higher odds of [[preterm birth]] ([[odds ratio]] 1.3) and [[congenital anomalies]] ([[odds ratio]] 1.3) among births having reached the blastocyst stage compared with cleavage stage.&lt;ref name="DarLazer2014"/&gt; Because of increased female embryo mortality due to epigenetic modifications induced by extended culture,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/113/12/3197.abstract&lt;/ref&gt; blastocyst transfer leads to more male births (56.1% male) versus 2 or 3 day transfer (a normal sex ratio of 51.5% male).

==Embryo selection==
{{Further|Embryo quality}}
Laboratories have developed grading methods to judge oocyte and [[embryo]] quality. In order to optimise [[pregnancy rate]]s, there is significant evidence that a morphological scoring system is the best strategy for the selection of embryos.&lt;ref name=Rebmann&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rebmann V, Switala M, Eue I, Grosse-Wilde H | title = Soluble HLA-G is an independent factor for the prediction of pregnancy outcome after ART: a German multi-centre study | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 25 | issue = 7 | pages = 1691–8 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20488801 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/deq120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 where the first [[time-lapse microscopy]] system for IVF was approved for clinical use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Unisense FertiliTech A/S Receives CE Mark of Approval for EmbryoScope(TM) Embryo Monitoring System | url=http://www.medindia.net/health-press-release/Unisense-FertiliTech-AS-Receives-CE-Mark-of-Approval-for-EmbryoScopeTM-Embryo-Monitoring-System-47803-1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; morphokinetic scoring systems has shown to improve to [[pregnancy rate]]s further.&lt;ref name="Meseguer"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meseguer M, Rubio I, Cruz M, Basile N, Marcos J, Requena A | title = Embryo incubation and selection in a time-lapse monitoring system improves pregnancy outcome compared with a standard incubator: a retrospective cohort study | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 98 | issue = 6 | pages = 1481–9.e10 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22975113 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.08.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when all different types of [[time-lapse embryo imaging]] devices, with or without morphokinetic scoring systems, are compared against conventional embryo assessment for IVF, there is insufficient evidence of a difference in live-birth, pregnancy, stillbirth or miscarriage to choose between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armstrong S, Arroll N, Cree LM, Jordan V, Farquhar C | title = Time-lapse systems for embryo incubation and assessment in assisted reproduction | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = CD011320 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25721906 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011320.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29800485|date = July 2018}} A small prospectively randomized study in 2016 reported poorer embryo quality and more staff time in an automated [[time-lapse embryo imaging]] device compared to conventional embryology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu YG, Lazzaroni-Tealdi E, Wang Q, Zhang L, Barad DH, Kushnir VA, Darmon SK, Albertini DF, Gleicher N | title = Different effectiveness of closed embryo culture system with time-lapse imaging (EmbryoScope(TM)) in comparison to standard manual embryology in good and poor prognosis patients: a prospectively randomized pilot study | journal = Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 49 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27553622 | pmc = 4995783 | doi = 10.1186/s12958-016-0181-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The embryo transfer procedure starts by placing a speculum in the vagina to visualize the cervix, which is cleansed with saline solution or culture media.  A soft&lt;ref name=mains/&gt; transfer catheter is loaded with the embryos and handed to the clinician after confirmation of the patient’s identity. The catheter is inserted through the cervical canal and advanced into the uterine cavity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvQZA7EWwmk |title=Embryo Transfer |date=25 March 2015 |publisher=Dr. John Jain on Youtube |last=Jain |first=John |access-date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is good and consistent evidence of benefit in ''ultrasound guidance'',&lt;ref name=mains/&gt; that is, making an abdominal ultrasound to ensure correct placement, which is 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm from the uterine fundus. There is evidence of a significant increase in clinical pregnancy using ultrasound guidance compared with only "clinical touch".&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014/&gt; Anesthesia is generally not required. Single embryo transfers in particular require accuracy and precision in placement within the uterine cavity. The optimal target for embryo placement, known as the maximal implantation potential (MIP) point, is identified using 3D/4D ultrasound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gergely RZ, DeUgarte CM, Danzer H, Surrey M, Hill D, DeCherney AH | title = Three dimensional/four dimensional ultrasound-guided embryo transfer using the maximal implantation potential point | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 84 | issue = 2 | pages = 500–3 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16084896 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.01.141 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is limited evidence that supports deposition of embryos in the midportion of the uterus.&lt;ref name=mains/&gt;

After insertion of the catheter, the contents are expelled and the embryos are deposited. Limited evidence supports making trial transfers before performing the procedure with embryos.&lt;ref name=mains/&gt; After expulsion, the duration that the catheter remains inside the uterus has no effect on pregnancy rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sroga JM, Montville CP, Aubuchon M, Williams DB, Thomas MA | title = Effect of delayed versus immediate embryo transfer catheter removal on pregnancy outcomes during fresh cycles | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 93 | issue = 6 | pages = 2088–90 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20116786 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.07.1664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited evidence suggests avoiding negative pressure from the catheter after expulsion.&lt;ref name=mains/&gt; After withdrawal, the catheter is handed to the embryologist, who inspects it for retained embryos.

In the process of [[zygote intrafallopian transfer]] (ZIFT), eggs are removed from the woman, fertilised, and then placed in the woman's fallopian tubes rather than the uterus.

=== Procedure simulation ===
In 2015, the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]] developed a [[medical simulation]] of the Embryo Transfer procedure with Swiss company VirtaMed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/asrm-and-virtamed-to-create-embryo-transfer-simulator-300062059.html |title=ASRM and VirtaMed to create embryo transfer simulator |publisher=PR Newswire |date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed for the education and training of clinicians. The  [[virtual reality]] simulator, which includes [[real-time simulation]] of ultrasound guidance, was launched at the annual conference of the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtamed.com/en/test-our-simulators/virtamed-asrm-2015/ |title=Launch of Embryo Transfer Simulator |publisher=VirtaMed |date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Embryo number ==
A major issue is how many embryos should be transferred. Placement of multiple embryos carries the risk of multiple pregnancy. In the past, physicians have often placed too many embryos in the hope to establish a pregnancy. However, the rise in multiple pregnancies has led to a reassessment of this approach. Professional societies and in many countries, the legislature, have issued guidelines or laws to curtail a practice of placing too many embryos in an attempt to reduce multiple pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newlife-ivf.co.uk/blog/ivf-laws-in-greece-2014.php |title=New Law regarding the number of embryos transferred in Greece |publisher=newlife-ivf.co.uk |date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table:&lt;ref name=nice2013&gt;[http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems].

The technique of selecting only one embryo to transfer to the woman is called '''elective-single embryo transfer'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''e-SET'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;) or, when embryos are at the blastocyst stage, it can also be called ''elective single blastocyst transfer (eSBT)''.&lt;ref name=mullin&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mullin CM, Fino ME, Talebian S, Krey LC, Licciardi F, Grifo JA | title = Comparison of pregnancy outcomes in elective single blastocyst transfer versus double blastocyst transfer stratified by age | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 93 | issue = 6 | pages = 1837–43 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 19249756 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It significantly lowers the risk of multiple pregnancies, compared with e.g. Double Embryo Transfer (DET) or ''double blastocyst transfer'' (2BT), with a twinning rate of approximately 3.5% in sET compared with approximately 38% in DET,&lt;ref name=Fauque&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fauque P, Jouannet P, Davy C, Guibert J, Viallon V, Epelboin S, Kunstmann JM, Patrat C | title = Cumulative results including obstetrical and neonatal outcome of fresh and frozen-thawed cycles in elective single versus double fresh embryo transfers | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 927–35 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 19446806 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.03.105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 2% in eSBT compared with approximately 25% in 2BT.&lt;ref name=mullin/&gt; At the same time, [[pregnancy rate]]s is not significantly less with eSBT than with 2BT.&lt;ref name=mullin/&gt; That is, the cumulative live birth rate associated with single fresh embryo transfer followed by a single frozen and thawed embryo transfer is comparable with that after one cycle of double fresh embryo transfer.&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014/&gt; Furthermore, SET has better outcomes in terms of mean gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, birthweight, and risk of [[neonatal intensive care unit]] necessity than DET.&lt;ref name=Fauque/&gt; e-SET of embryos at the cleavage stage reduces the likelihood of live birth by 38% and multiple birth by 94%.&lt;ref name=gelbaya&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gelbaya TA, Tsoumpou I, Nardo LG | title = The likelihood of live birth and multiple birth after single versus double embryo transfer at the cleavage stage: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 936–45 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 19446809 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from randomized, controlled trials suggests that increasing the number of e-SET attempts (fresh and/or frozen) results in a cumulative live birth rate similar to that of DET.&lt;ref name=gelbaya/&gt;

The usage of single embryo transfer is highest in Sweden (69.4%), but as low as 2.8% in the USA. Access to public funding for ART, availability of good [[cryopreservation]] facilities, effective education about the risks of multiple pregnancy, and legislation appear to be the most important factors for regional usage of single embryo transfer.&lt;ref name=Maheshwari2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maheshwari A, Griffiths S, Bhattacharya S | title = Global variations in the uptake of single embryo transfer | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–20 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20634207 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, personal choice plays a significant role as many subfertile couples have a strong preference for twins.&lt;ref name=Maheshwari2011/&gt;

== Adjunctive procedures ==
There is limited evidence to support the use of mechanical closure of the cervical canal following embryo transfer.&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014/&gt;

There is insufficient evidence to support a certain amount of time for women to remain recumbent
following embryo transfer.&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014/&gt;

There is no evidence of benefit in terms of live birth rate of using [[hyaluronic acid]] as adherence medium for the embryo.&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014/&gt; Neither is there any evidence of benefit of having a full bladder, removal of cervical mucus, or flushing of the endometrial or endocervical cavity at the time of embryo transfer.&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014/&gt; Adjunctive antibiotics in the form of [[amoxicillin]] plus [[clavulanic acid]] does not increase the clinical pregnancy rate compared with no antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014/&gt;

For frozen-thawed embryo transfer or transfer of embryo from [[egg donation]], no previous [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]] is required for the recipient before transfer, which can be performed in spontaneous ovulatory cycles. Still, various protocols exist for frozen-thawed embryo transfers as well, such as protocols with [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]], protocols in which the endometrium is artificially prepared by [[estrogen]] and/or [[progesterone]]. A [[Cochrane review]] in 2010 of randomized studies came to the result that there generally is insufficient evidence to support the use of one intervention in preference to another, but with some evidence that in cycles where the endometrium is artificially prepared by estrogen or progesterone, it is beneficial to administer an additional drug that suppresses hormone production by the ovaries such as continuous administration of a [[gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist]] (GnRHa).&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghobara T, Vandekerckhove P | title = Cycle regimens for frozen-thawed embryo transfer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 1 | pages = CD003414 | date = January 2008 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003414.pub2 | editor1-last = Ghobara | editor1-first = Tarek }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[egg donation]], there is evidence of a lower pregnancy rate and a higher cycle cancellation rate when the progesterone supplementation in the recipient is commenced ''prior'' to [[oocyte retrieval]] from the donor, as compared to commenced day of oocyte retrieval or the day after.&lt;ref name=Farquhar2014/&gt;

[[Semen|Seminal fluid]] contains several proteins that interact with epithelial cells of the [[cervix]] and [[uterus]], inducing active [[gestational immune tolerance]]. There are significantly improved outcomes when women are exposed to seminal plasma around the time of embryo transfer, with statistical significance for [[clinical pregnancy]], but not for ongoing pregnancy or [[live birth rate]]s with the limited data available.&lt;ref name="CrawfordRay2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crawford G, Ray A, Gudi A, Shah A, Homburg R | title = The role of seminal plasma for improved outcomes during in vitro fertilization treatment: review of the literature and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 275–84 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25281684 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmu052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Follow-up ==
Patients usually start progesterone medication after egg (also called oocyte) retrieval. While daily intramuscular injections of progesterone-in-oil (PIO) have been the standard route of administration, PIO injections are not FDA-approved for use in pregnancy.  A recent meta-analysis showed that the intravaginal route with an appropriate dose and dosing frequency is equivalent to daily intramuscular injections.&lt;ref name="Zarutskiea_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zarutskiea PW, Phillips JA | title = Re-analysis of vaginal progesterone as luteal phase support (LPS) in assisted reproduction (ART) cycles | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 88 | issue = supplement 1 | pages = S113 | date = 2007| doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.07.365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a recent case-matched study comparing vaginal progesterone with PIO injections showed that live birth rates were nearly identical with both methods.&lt;ref&gt;Khan N, Richter KS, Blake EJ, et al. Case-matched comparison of intramuscular versus vaginal progesterone for luteal phase support after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. Presented at: 55th Annual Meeting of the Pacific Coast Reproductive Society; 18–22 April 2007; Rancho Mirage, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; A duration of progesterone administration of 11 days results in almost the same [[birth rate]]s as longer durations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goudge CS, Nagel TC, Damario MA | title = Duration of progesterone-in-oil support after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer: a randomized, controlled trial | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 946–51 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 19523613 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients are also given estrogen medication in some cases after the embryo transfer. Pregnancy testing is done typically two weeks after egg retrieval.

== Third-party reproduction ==
It is not necessary that the embryo transfer be performed on the female who provided the eggs. Thus another female whose uterus is appropriately prepared can receive the embryo and become pregnant.
Embryo transfer may be used where a woman who has eggs but no uterus and wants to have a biological baby; she would require the help of a [[gestational carrier]] or surrogate to carry the pregnancy. Also, a woman who has no eggs but a uterus may utilize [[egg donor]] IVF, in which case another woman would provide eggs for fertilization and the resulting embryos are placed into the uterus of the patient. Fertilization may be performed using the woman's partner's sperm or by using donor sperm. 'Spare' embryos which are created for another couple undergoing IVF treatment but which are then surplus to that couple's needs may also be transferred (called [[embryo donation]]). Embryos may be specifically created by using eggs and sperm from donors and these can then be transferred into the uterus of another woman. A surrogate may carry a baby produced by embryo transfer for another couple, even though neither she nor the 'commissioning' couple is biologically related to the child. Third party reproduction is controversial and regulated in many countries. Persons entering gestational surrogacy arrangements must make sense of an entirely new type of relationship that does not fit any of the traditional scripts we use to categorize relations as kinship, friendship, romantic partnership or market relations.&lt;ref name="ucpress.edu"&gt;Teman, Elly. 2010. [http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/11401.php Birthing a Mother: the Surrogate Body and the Pregnant Self.] Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Surrogates have the experience of carrying a baby that they conceptualize as not of their own kin, while intended mothers have the experience of waiting through nine months of pregnancy and transitioning to motherhood from outside of the pregnant body. This can lead to new conceptualizations of body and self.&lt;ref name="ucpress.edu"/&gt;

== History ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--two paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
The first transfer of an embryo from one human to another resulting in pregnancy was reported in July 1983 and subsequently led to the announcement of the first human birth 3 February 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9404EEDC143BF937A35751C0A962948260 | work=The New York Times |title=Infertile Woman Has Baby Through Embryo Transfer |first=Sandra |last=Blakeslee |date=4 February 1984 |access-date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure was performed at the Harbor UCLA Medical Center &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humc.edu/calendar/careacc.html |title=HUMC - Celebrating 50 Years of Caring |work=humc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of Dr. [[John Buster]] and the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine.

In the procedure, an embryo that was just beginning to develop was transferred from one woman in whom it had been conceived by [[artificial insemination]] to another woman who gave birth to the infant 38 weeks later. The sperm used in the artificial insemination came from the husband of the woman who bore the baby.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952517,00.html |work=Time |title=Medicine: A Legal, Moral, Social Nightmare |date=10 September 1984 |first1=Otto |last1=Friedrich |first2=Anne |last2=Constable |first3=Raji |last3=Samghabadi |access-date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952514,00.html |work=Time |title=The New Origins of Life |date=10 September 1984 |access-date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This scientific breakthrough established standards and became an agent of change for women suffering from the afflictions of infertility and for women who did not want to pass on genetic disorders to their children. Donor embryo transfer has given women a mechanism to become pregnant and give birth to a child that will contain their husband’s genetic makeup. Although donor embryo transfer as practiced today has evolved from the original non-surgical method, it now accounts for approximately 5% of in vitro fertilization recorded births.

Prior to this, thousands of women who were [[infertile]], had adoption as the only path to parenthood. This set the stage to allow open and candid discussion of embryo donation and transfer. This breakthrough has given way to the donation of human embryos as a common practice similar to other donations such as blood and major organ donations. At the time of this announcement the event was captured by major news carriers and fueled healthy debate and discussion on this practice which impacted the future of reproductive medicine by creating a platform for further advancements in woman's health.

This work established the technical foundation and legal-ethical framework surrounding the clinical use of human [[oocyte]] and [[embryo donation]], a mainstream clinical practice, which has evolved over the past 25 years.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
A Cochrane systematic review updated in 2012 showed that blastocyst stage transfer is more effective than cleavage (day 2 or 3) stage transfer in assisted reproductive technologies. It showed a small improvement in live birth rate per couple for blastocyst transfers. This would mean that for a typical rate of 31% in clinics that use early cleavage stage cycles, the rate would increase to 32% to 42% live births if clinics used blastocyst transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Glujovsky D, Blake D, Farquhar C, Bardach A.

Embryo transfer techniques allow top quality female [[livestock]] to have a greater influence on the genetic advancement of a herd or flock in much the same way that [[artificial insemination]] has allowed greater use of superior sires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jobfunctions.bnet.com/abstract.aspx?docid=118654 Embryo Transfer in Cattle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514154230/http://jobfunctions.bnet.com/abstract.aspx?docid=118654 |date=14 May 2008 }}. Retrieved 21 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ET also allows the continued use of animals such as competition mares to continue training and showing, while producing [[foal]]s. The general epidemiological aspects of embryo transfer indicates that the transfer of embryos provides the opportunity to introduce genetic material into populations of livestock while greatly reducing the risk for transmission of infectious diseases. Recent developments in the sexing of embryos before transfer and implanting has great potential in the dairy and other livestock industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agnet.org/library/tb/151b/ Embryo Sexing Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302071934/http://www.agnet.org/library/tb/151b/ |date=2 March 2009 }}. Retrieved 21 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embryo transfer is also used in [[laboratory mice]]. For example, embryos of genetically modified strains that are difficult to breed or expensive to maintain may be stored frozen, and only thawed and implanted into a [[False pregnancy#Mice|pseudopregnant]] dam when needed.

'''Emer Colleran''' (12 October 1945 – 30 June 2018) was an Irish [[microbiologist]], academic and an environmental advocate. She was professor of microbiology at the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]], a member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]], one of [[Mary Robinson]]'s nominees on the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]], and chairwoman of [[An Taisce]] - the National Trust for Ireland.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/leading-scientist-and-advocate-for-environment-1.3571360|title=Leading scientist and advocate for environment|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth and education ==

Colleran, and her twin Noreen, were born in [[Ballinrobe]], [[County Mayo|Co Mayo]] in October 1945 to John and Josie Colleran. One of a  family of five children, her father was a school principal and her mother, also a primary school teacher, died when she was just 11 years old. She completed her secondary education at St Louis secondary school in [[Kiltimagh]]. She spent a lot of time outdoors as a child, particularly fishing, which sparked her interest in the environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Galway woman Emer at the heart of the 'green' revolution|last=McGee|first=Harry|date=19 January 1990|work=The City Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On entering higher education, she had a grant from the Department of Education, which required that she had to do her studies through the Irish language. Her first choice, Medicine, was not available through Irish so she chose Science.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She graduated with a first class primary degree in Science at University College Galway (now [[National University of Ireland, Galway]]) in 1967.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Ballinrobe News|last=|first=|date=7 October 1967|work=Mayo News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She specialised in [[anaerobic digestion]] as a postgraduate and in 1971 became a postdoctoral fellow for two years at the [[University of Bristol]] in the UK.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Academic career ==

Colleran lectured in biology at [[Athlone Institute of Technology|Athlone Regional Technical College]] (now AIT) and [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology|Galway Regional Technical College]] (now GMIT) before her appointment as a lecturer in microbiology at NUIG in 1976.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was appointed Associate Professor of microbiology by the Senate of the National University of Ireland in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Ballinrobe Native|last=|first=|date=18 July 1990|work=Western People|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a member of the university's governing authority for a number of years, but stepped down in May 2000 in connection with the selection procedure for the new university president. In October that year she was appointed professor of microbiology and chair of the department at NUIG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/professor-appointed-despite-failing-irish-test-1.299858|title=Professor appointed despite failing Irish test|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first director of the Environment Change Institute at NUIG set up under the [[Higher Education Authority]]'s Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/research-team-investigates-eco-friendly-waste-disposal-1.305836|title=Research team investigates eco-friendly waste disposal|last=|first=|date=3 May 2001|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmentalist ==
In 1973 Colleran was elected to the committee of the Galway Association of [[An Taisce]], part of a national voluntary organisation the aims of which were to conservation in Ireland through education, publicity and positive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=An Taisce triples membership|last=|first=|date=2 November 1973|work=The Connacht Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Taisce Talk|last=|first=|date=18 April 1975|work=The Connacht Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as membership secretary and then treasurer to the Galway branch before becoming chairman. In 1981, as chairman of the Galway branch, she hit back at claims from [[Galway County Council]] that An Taisce were ''an anonymous group, wielding power unfairly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Taisce hits back hard at knockers|last=|first=|date=6 November 1981|work=The Connacht Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was involved in the compilation of a controversial planning report, published by An Taisce in 1983, which highlighted abuse of planning laws by city and county councillors across Ireland, and in particular in counties Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry and Louth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Planning report hits at councillors|last=Dillon|first=William|date=9 March 1983|work=The Irish Independent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Taisce renews call on planning|last=|first=|date=15 November 1983|work=The Irish Examiner|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She served as Environmental Officer for An Taisce before being elected National Chairman in 1987, the first time a chairman had come from one of the western county associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Honour for city environmentalist|last=|first=|date=10 July 1987|work=City Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to use her position to campaign against misuse of planning laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Council accused of Section 4 "misuse"|last=|first=|date=18 July 1987|work=The Tuam Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a clamp down on pollution of rivers and lakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Pollution clamp down demand|last=Cunningham|first=Eddie|date=20 August 1987|work=The Irish Independent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and against a move to scrap An Foras Forbartha, a body that provided independent monitoring of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Anger at move to axe Foras|last=Downing|first=John|date=3 September 1987|work=The Irish Press|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her three years as chairman, until May 1990, she was particularly involved in debates over local environmental and planning issues, in particular over gold mining in the west of Ireland, a proposed airport for [[Clifden]], and the planned sewage treatment plant at [[Mutton Island, County Galway|Mutton Island]] in Galway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1991 plans were announced for a new visitor centre, to be located at [[Mullaghmore, County Clare|Mullaghmore]] in [[The Burren]]. Colleran was among those who were part of an appeal, saying that while the plan for the national park was welcomed by An Taisce, they wanted the visitor centre to be located three or four miles from Mullaghmore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Green Alliance to fight Burren centre plan|last=O'Brien|first=Tony|date=12 June 1991|work=The Irish Independent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appointments and honours ==
President [[Mary Robinson|Mary Robbins]] appointed seven new members to her [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]] in February 1991, including Colleran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Mrs Robinson's Chosen Few|last=|first=|date=21 February 1991|work=The Irish Independent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=President's new team|last=|first=|date=21 February 1991|work=The Irish Examiner|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other new members appointed at the time were [[Monica Barnes]], Patricia O'Donovan, Quintan Oliver, Rosemarie Smith, Dónal Toolan and D. Kenneth Whitaker. The new Council of State represented a wide spectrum of Irish life and was widely welcomed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Surprise and delight at the President's top secret choices|last=|first=|date=21 February 1991|work=The Irish Independent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Fine Gael]] was disappointed that its leader [[John Bruton]] was not included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=FG upset at President's snub of Bruton|last=Foley|first=John|date=21 February 1991|work=The Irish Independent|access-date=|last2=Dowling|first2=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, she was one of 15 people appointed to [[Taoiseach]] [[Charles Haughey]]'s Green 2000 Advisory Group, to determine which problems would face the environment in the next century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25274">Cases of [[epilepsy]] may be organized into '''epilepsy syndromes''' by the specific features that are present. These features include the age at which seizures begin, the seizure types, and [[electroencephalography|EEG]] findings, among others. Identifying an epilepsy syndrome is useful as it helps determine the underlying causes as well as what [[anticonvulsant|anti-seizure medication]] should be tried.&lt;ref name = ileasyndromes2014&gt;{{ cite web | title=Epilepsy syndromes | url = https://www.epilepsydiagnosis.org/syndrome/epilepsy-syndrome-groupoverview.html | publisher = International league against epilepsy | accessdate = 2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NChp9&gt;{{cite book|title=The Epilepsies: The diagnosis and management of the epilepsies in adults and children in primary and secondary care|publisher=National Clinical Guideline Centre|chapter=Chapter 9: Classification of seizures and epilepsy syndromes|pages=119–129|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13635/57784/57784.pdf|author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to categorize a case of epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early.&lt;ref name=Nel2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neligan|first=A|author2=Hauser, WA |author3=Sander, JW |title=The epidemiology of the epilepsies.|journal=Handbook of clinical neurology|year=2012|volume=107|pages=113–33|pmid=22938966|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-52898-8.00006-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less serious examples are [[benign rolandic epilepsy]] (2.8 per 100,000), [[childhood absence epilepsy]] (0.8 per 100,000) and [[juvenile myoclonic epilepsy]] (0.7 per 100,000).&lt;ref name=Nel2012/&gt; Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused, at least partly, by some aspect of epilepsy, are also referred to as epileptic encephalopathies. These are associated with frequent [[seizures]] that are resistant to treatment and severe cognitive dysfunction, for instance [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]] and [[West syndrome]].&lt;ref name=jcnnordli2012&gt;{{cite journal | journal = J Clin Neurophysiol | year = 2012 | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 420–4 | doi = 10.1097/WNP.0b013e31826bd961 | title = Epileptic encephalopathies in infants and children | author = Nordli DR jr | pmid = 23027099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epilepsies with onset in childhood are a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes and characteristics. Some people have no obvious underlying neurological problems or [[metabolism|metabolic]] disturbances.&lt;ref name = conpandolfo2013&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Curr Opin Neurol | year = 2013 | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–45 |  title = Pediatric epilepsy genetics | author = Pandolfo M | doi = 10.1097/WCO.0b013e32835f19da | pmid = 23449174}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be associated with variable degrees of intellectual disability, elements of [[autism spectrum|autism]], other [[mental disorder]]s, and motor difficulties. Others have underlying inherited metabolic diseases, [[chromosome|chromosomal]] abnormalities, [[phakomatose|specific eye, skin and nervous system features]], or malformations of cortical development.&lt;ref name = conpandolfo2013/&gt; Some of these epilepsies can be categorized into the traditional epilepsy syndromes. Furthermore, a variety of clinical syndromes exist of which the main feature is not epilepsy but which are associated with a higher risk of epilepsy. For instance between 1 and 10% of those with [[Down syndrome]] and 90% of those with [[Angelman syndrome]] have epilepsy.&lt;ref name=Bh2011&gt;{{Cite journal  |last1 = Bhalla | first1 = D. | last2 = Godet | first2 = B. | last3 = Druet-Cabanac | first3 = M. |last4 = Preux | first4 = PM. | title = Etiologies of epilepsy: a comprehensive review. | journal = Expert Rev Neurother | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 861–76 |date=Jun 2011 | doi = 10.1586/ern.11.51 | PMID = 21651333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, genetics is believed to play an important role in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms. Simple and complex modes of [[inheritance]] have been identified for some of them. However, extensive screening has failed to identify many single rare [[gene]] variants of large effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinzen EL, Depondt C, Cavalleri GL, Ruzzo EK, Walley NM, Need AC, Ge D, He M, Cirulli ET, Zhao Q, Cronin KD, Gumbs CE, Campbell CR, Hong LK, Maia JM, Shianna KV, McCormack M, Radtke RA, O'Conner GD, Mikati MA, Gallentine WB, Husain AM, Sinha SR, Chinthapalli K, Puranam RS, McNamara JO, Ottman R, Sisodiya SM, Delanty N, Goldstein DB | title = Exome sequencing followed by large-scale genotyping failed to identify single rare variants of large effect in "idiopathic" generalized epilepsy | journal = Am J Hum Genet | year = 2012 | volume = 91 | pages = 293–302 | pmid = 22863189 | pmc = 3415540 | doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.06.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the epileptic encephalopathies, de novo [[mutagenesis]] appear to be an important mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Nat Rev Neurol | year = 2014 | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 283–92 | doi = 10.1038/nrneurol.2014.62 | title = The hidden genetics of epilepsy-a clinically important new paradigm |vauthors=Thomas RH, Berkovic SF | pmid = 24733163 | url = http://www.nature.com/nrneurol/journal/v10/n5/full/nrneurol.2014.62.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=n23934111&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Nature | year = 2013 | volume = 501 | issue = 7466 | pages = 217–21 | doi = 10.1038/nature12439 | title = De novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathies | pmid = 23934111 | pmc = 3773011}}&lt;/ref&gt; De novo means that a child is affected, but the parents do not have the mutation.

In [[Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus|Dravet syndrome]] a single affected gene was identified.&lt;ref name=n23934111/&gt;

Syndromes in which causes are not clearly identified are difficult to match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases is made somewhat arbitrarily.&lt;ref name="2011rec"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shorvon SD | title = The etiologic classification of epilepsy | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 1052–1057 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03041.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''idiopathic'' (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause.&lt;ref name="2011rec"/&gt; Some childhood epilepsy syndromes are included in the unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance [[benign rolandic epilepsy]]. Others are included in ''symptomatic'' despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]].&lt;ref name="2011rec"/&gt; Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. [[Angelman syndrome]]) were categorized ''symptomatic'' but it was argued to include these within the category ''idiopathic''.&lt;ref name="2011rec"/&gt; Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.

==Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy==
[[Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy]] (ADNFLE) is an idiopathic localization-related epilepsy that is an inherited epileptic disorder that causes seizures during sleep. Onset is usually in childhood. These seizures arise from the frontal lobes and consist of complex motor movements, such as hand clenching, arm raising/lowering, and knee bending. Vocalizations such as shouting, moaning, or crying are also common. ADNFLE is often misdiagnosed as nightmares. ADNFLE has a genetic basis.&lt;ref name="Bertrand2002"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genes encode various [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s.

==Rolandic epilepsy==
Benign centrotemporal lobe epilepsy of childhood or benign [[Rolandic epilepsy]] is an idiopathic localization-related epilepsy that occurs in children between the ages of 3 and 13 years, with peak onset in prepubertal late childhood. Apart from their seizure disorder, these patients are otherwise normal. This syndrome features simple focal seizures that involve facial muscles and frequently cause drooling. Although most episodes are brief, seizures sometimes spread and generalize. Seizures are typically nocturnal and confined to sleep. The [[EEG]] may demonstrate spike discharges that occur over the centrotemporal scalp over the central sulcus of the brain (the Rolandic sulcus) that are predisposed to occur during drowsiness or light sleep. Seizures cease near puberty.&lt;ref name="BRE1988"&gt;{{cite journal

 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seizures may require [[anticonvulsant]] treatment, but sometimes are infrequent enough to allow physicians to defer treatment.

==Benign occipital epilepsy of childhood==
{{see also|Occipital epilepsy}}
Benign occipital epilepsy of childhood (BOEC) is an idiopathic localization-related epilepsy and consists of an evolving group of syndromes. Most authorities include two subtypes, an early subtype with onset between three and five years, and a late onset between seven and 10 years. Seizures in BOEC usually feature visual symptoms such as scotoma or fortifications (brightly colored spots or lines) or amaurosis (blindness or impairment of vision). Convulsions involving one half the body, hemiconvulsions, or forced eye deviation or head turning are common. Younger patients typically experience symptoms similar to migraine with nausea and headache, and older patients typically complain of more visual symptoms. The [[EEG]] in BOEC shows spikes recorded from the occipital (back of head) regions. The EEG and genetic pattern suggest an autosomal dominant transmission as described by [[Ruben Kuzniecky]], et al.&lt;ref name="Kuzniecky1987"&gt;{{cite journal

==Childhood absence epilepsy==
[[Childhood absence epilepsy]] (CAE) is an idiopathic generalized epilepsy that affects children between the ages of 4 and 12 years of age, although peak onset is around five to six years old. These patients have recurrent [[absence seizures]], brief episodes of unresponsive staring, sometimes with minor motor features such as eye blinking or subtle chewing.  The EEG finding in CAE is generalized 3&amp;nbsp;Hz spike and wave discharges. Some go on to develop generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This condition carries a good prognosis because children do not usually show cognitive decline or neurological deficits, and the seizures in the majority cease spontaneously with ongoing maturation.

==Dravet syndrome==
[[Dravet syndrome]], previously known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), is a neurodevelopmental disorder beginning in infancy and characterized by severe epilepsy that does not respond well to treatment. This syndrome was described by Charlotte Dravet, French psychiatrist and [[epileptologist]] (born July 14, 1936). Dravet described this syndrome while working at the Centre Saint Paul at the University of [[Marseille]]. At Centre Saint Paul, one of her supervisors was Henri Gastaut, who described the [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]]. She described this condition in 1978&lt;ref name="Dravet1978"&gt;Dravet C (1978) Les epilepsies graves de l'enfant. Vie Médicale 8: 543–548&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the prevalence of this rare disorder have ranged from 1:20,000 to 1:40,000 births, though the incidence may be found to be greater as the syndrome becomes better recognized and new genetic evidence is discovered. It is thought to occur with similar frequency in both genders, and knows no geographic or ethnic boundaries. The course of Dravet syndrome is highly variable from person to person. Seizures begin during the first year of life and development is normal before their onset. In most cases, the first seizures occur with fever and are generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) or unilateral (one-sided) convulsions. These seizures are often prolonged, and may lead to status epilepticus, a medical emergency. In time, seizures increase in frequency and begin to occur without fever. Additional seizure types appear, most often these are myoclonic, atypical absence, and focal seizures. Additional features that are seen in significant numbers of patients with Dravet syndrome may include [[sensory processing disorder]]s and other [[autism spectrum]] characteristics, orthopedic or movement disorders, frequent or chronic upper respiratory and ear infections, sleep disturbance, [[dysautonomia]], and problems with growth and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idea-league.org/dravet-syndrome |title=Dravet Syndrome |accessdate=2010-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013130606/http://idea-league.org/dravet-syndrome |archivedate=2010-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epilepsy in females with mental retardation==
[[Epilepsy in females with mental retardation]], is characterized by seizure onset in infancy or early childhood (6–36 months) and cognitive impairment in some cases.  Seizures are predominantly generalized, including tonic-clonic, tonic and atonic seizures. The spectrum of phenotypes has been extended to include female patients with early onset epileptic encephalopathies resembling Dravet syndrome, FIRES, Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) or focal epilepsy with or without mental retardation. EFMR is caused by mutations in PCDH19 (protocadherin 19).

==Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome==
[[Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome]] (FIRES)

==Frontal lobe epilepsy==
[[Frontal lobe epilepsy]], usually a symptomatic or cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy, arises from lesions causing seizures that occur in the frontal lobes of the brain. These epilepsies can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of seizures can easily be confused with nonepileptic spells and, because of limitations of the EEG, be difficult to "see" with standard scalp [[EEG]].
Juvenile absence epilepsy is an idiopathic generalized epilepsy with later onset than CAE, typically in prepubertal adolescence, with the most frequent seizure type being absence seizures. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures can occur. Often, 3&amp;nbsp;Hz spike-wave or multiple spike discharges can be seen on EEG. The prognosis is mixed, with some patients going on to a syndrome that is poorly distinguishable from JME.

==Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy==
[[Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy]] (JME) is an idiopathic generalized epilepsy that occurs in patients aged 8 to 20 years. Patients have normal cognition and are otherwise neurologically intact. The most common seizure is myoclonic jerks, although generalized tonic-clonic seizures and absence seizures may occur as well. Myoclonic jerks usually cluster in the early morning after awakening. The EEG reveals generalized 4–6&amp;nbsp;Hz spike wave discharges or multiple spike discharges. These patients are often first diagnosed when they have their first generalized tonic-clonic seizure later in life, when they experience sleep deprivation (e.g., freshman year in college after staying up late to study for exams). Alcohol withdrawal can also be a major contributing factor in [[breakthrough seizure]]s, as well. The risk of the tendency to have seizures is lifelong; however, the majority have well-controlled seizures with anticonvulsant medication and avoidance of seizure precipitants.

==Lennox-Gastaut syndrome==
[[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]] (LGS) is a generalized epilepsy that consists of a triad of developmental delay or childhood dementia, mixed generalized seizures, and [[EEG]] demonstrating a pattern of approximately 2&amp;nbsp;Hz "slow" spike-waves. Onset occurs between two and 18 years.

Epilepsy is consider a chronic (meaning it lasts for a long time) condition that is defined by seizures. [http://livingwithlgs.com/about-lgs.aspx Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS)] is a rare and severe form of epilepsy.

As in West syndrome, LGS result from idiopathic, symptomatic, or cryptogenic causes, and many patients first have [[West syndrome]]. Authorities emphasize different seizure types as important in LGS, but most have astatic seizures (drop attacks), tonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, atypical absence seizures, and sometimes, focal seizures. Anticonvulsants are usually only partially successful in treatment.

==Ohtahara syndrome==
[[Ohtahara syndrome]] is a rare but severe epilepsy syndrome usually starting in the first few days or weeks of life. The seizures are often in the form of stiffening spasms but other seizures including unilateral ones may be seen. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is characteristic. The prognosis is poor with about half of the infants dying in the first year of life; most if not all surviving infants are severely intellectually disabled and many have cerebral palsy. There is no effective treatment. A number of children have underlying structural brain abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;(Aicardi J and Ohtahara S. Severe neonatal epilepsies with suppression-burst pattern.

John Libbey Eurotext 2005 {{ISBN|2-7420-0569-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reflex epilepsies==
About 6% of those with epilepsy have seizures that are often triggered by specific events, known as [[reflex seizures]].&lt;ref name=Reflex2008&gt;{{cite book|title=Behavioral aspects of epilepsy : principles and practice|year=2008|publisher=Demos|location=New York|isbn=9781933864044|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6Ygv5_RKKsC&amp;pg=PA125|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|editor=Steven C. Schachter}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of epilepsy syndromes, known as [[reflex epilepsies]], have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xue|first=LY|author2=Ritaccio, AL |title=Reflex seizures and reflex epilepsy.|journal=American journal of electroneurodiagnostic technology|date=March 2006|volume=46|issue=1|pages=39–48|pmid=16605171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common triggers include: flashing lights and sudden noises.&lt;ref name=Reflex2008/&gt;

Those with [[photosensitive epilepsy]] can have seizures triggered by flashing lights. Other precipitants can trigger an epileptic seizure in patients who otherwise would be susceptible to spontaneous seizures. For example, children with [[childhood absence epilepsy]] may be susceptible to [[hyperventilation]]. In fact, flashing lights and hyperventilation are activating procedures used in clinical [[EEG]] to help trigger seizures to aid diagnosis. Finally, other precipitants can facilitate, rather than obligately trigger, seizures in susceptible individuals. Emotional stress, sleep deprivation, sleep itself, heat stress, alcohol and febrile illness are examples of precipitants cited by patients with epilepsy. Notably, the influence of various precipitants varies with the epilepsy syndrome.&lt;ref name="Frucht2000"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Frucht MM, Quigg M, Schwaner C, Fountain NB | title =Distribution of seizure precipitants among epilepsy syndromes | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 41 | issue = 12|pages = 1534–1539. | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1111/j.1499-1654.2000.001534.x | pmid = 11114210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[menstrual cycle]] in women with epilepsy can influence patterns of seizure recurrence.

[[Catamenial epilepsy]] (CE) is when seizures cluster around certain phases of a woman's menstrual cycle.

==Progressive myoclonic epilepsis==
Progressive myoclonic epilepsies define a group of symptomatic generalized epilepsies characterized by progressive [[dementia]] and myoclonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures may occur as well. Diseases usually classified in this group are [[Unverricht-Lundborg disease]], myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers ([[MERRF syndrome]]), [[Lafora disease]], neuronal ceroid lipofucinosis, and sialdosis.

==Rasmussen's encephalitis==
[[Rasmussen's encephalitis]] is a symptomatic localization-related epilepsy that is a progressive, inflammatory lesion affecting children with onset before the age of 10. Seizures start as separate focal seizures and may progress to [[epilepsia partialis continua]] (simple partial status epilepticus). Neuroimaging shows inflammatory encephalitis on one side of the brain that may spread if not treated. Dementia and hemiparesis are other problems. The cause is hypothesized to involve an immulogical attack against glutamate receptors, a common neurotransmitter in the brain.&lt;ref name="Rogers1994"&gt;{{cite journal

 | year = 1994
 | doi = 10.1126/science.8036512
 | pmid = 8036512
 | issue=5172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporal lobe epilepsy==
[[Temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE) is not a classic syndrome but mentioned here because it is the most common epilepsy of adults. It is a symptomatic localization-related epilepsy and in most cases the epileptogenic region is found in the midline ([[mesial]]) temporal structures (e.g., the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]], and [[parahippocampal gyrus]]). Seizures begin in late childhood and adolescence. Most of these patients have focal seizures sometimes preceded by an [[Aura (symptom)|aura]], and some TLE patients also have secondary generalized [[tonic-clonic seizures]]. Often seizures do not sufficiently respond to medical treatment with [[anticonvulsant]]s and [[epilepsy surgery]] may be considered.&lt;ref name="Bell 2009 2053–2060"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Michael |author2=Rao S |author3=So EL |author4=Trenerry M |author5=Kazemi N |author6=Stead SM |author7=Cascino G |author8=Marsh R |author9=Meyer FB |author10=Watson RE |author11=Giannini C |author12=Worrell GA|title=Epilepsy surgery outcomes in temporal lobe epilepsy with a normal MRI|journal=Epilepsia|year=2009|volume=50|issue=9|pages=2053–2060|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02079.x|pmid=19389144|pmc=2841514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==West syndrome==
[[West syndrome]] is a triad of developmental delay, seizures termed [[infantile spasms]], and [[EEG]] demonstrating a pattern termed [[hypsarrhythmia]]. Onset occurs between three months and two years, with peak onset between eight and nine months. West syndrome may arise from idiopathic, symptomatic, or cryptogenic causes. The most common cause is tuberous sclerosis. The prognosis varies with the underlying cause. In general, most surviving patients remain with significant cognitive impairment and continuing seizures and may evolve to another eponymic syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It can be classified as idiopathic, syndromic, or cryptogenic depending on cause and can arise from both focal or generalized epileptic lesions.

'''Exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO)''' is a transient, reversible narrowing of the [[larynx]] that occurs during high intensity exercise. This acts to impair airflow and cause [[shortness of breath]], [[stridor]] and often discomfort in the throat and upper chest. EILO is a very common cause of breathing difficulties in young athletic individuals but is often misdiagnosed as [[asthma]] or [[exercise-induced bronchoconstriction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=A.|last2=Thomas|first2=M.|last3=Sandhu|first3=G.|last4=Hull|first4=J.

== What causes EILO? ==
* EILO arises because of a relative mechanical 'insufficiency' of the laryngeal structures that should act to maintain glottic patency. 
* It has been proposed that a narrowing at the laryngeal inlet during the state of high airflow (e.g. when running fast), can act to cause a pressure drop across the larynx which then acts to 'pull' the laryngeal structures together. The [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli]] principle states that increasing airflow through a tube creates increasing negative pressures within that tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Røksund|first=Ola Drange|last2=Heimdal|first2=John-Helge|last3=Olofsson|first3=Jan|last4=Maat|first4=Robert Christiaan|last5=Halvorsen|first5=Thomas|date=2015|title=Larynx during exercise: the unexplored bottleneck of the airways|journal=European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology|volume=272|issue=9|pages=2101–2109|doi=10.1007/s00405-014-3159-3|pmc=4526593|pmid=25033930}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complex neuromuscular functioning is required to maintain laryngeal opening and to allow the larynx to achieve a great number of tasks (i.e. speaking, airway protection, swallowing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hull|first=James H.|last2=Backer|first2=Vibeke|last3=Gibson|first3=Peter G.|last4=Fowler|first4=Stephen J.|date=2016-11-01|title=Laryngeal Dysfunction: Assessment and Management for the Clinician|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|volume=194|issue=9|pages=1062–1072|doi=10.1164/rccm.201606-1249CI|pmid=27575803}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus also possible that EILO may arise as form a degree of neuromuscular failure.
* A small heredity study indicated that an autosomal dominant model of inheritance with variable expressivity and reduced penetrance in males may be relevant; because in ten families studied, there was at least one affected person in every generation in which both parents were examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsted|first=Emil Schwarz|last2=Hvedstrup|first2=Jeppe|last3=Eiberg|first3=Hans|last4=Backer|first4=Vibeke|date=August 2017|title=Heredity of supraglottic exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction|journal=The European Respiratory Journal|volume=50|issue=2|doi=10.1183/13993003.00423-2017|pmc=5593372|pmid=28818875}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Further work is needed to determine if structural deficiencies in the laryngeal tissue of individuals with EILO are present.

== What happens in EILO? ==
* EILO is typically caused by a narrowing of the supra-glottic structures of the larynx. In severe cases, these structures, also called [[Arytenoid cartilage|arytenoids]], can close over to almost completely close the laryngeal inlet. 
* In fewer cases, the glottic (i.e. vocal cord) structures close together and this is typically what happens during exercise-induced vocal-cord dysfunction. 
* EILO develops during intense exercise and closure develops as exercise become more intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olin|first=J.

* Closure of the voice box during exercise causes increased 'loading' on the breathing system and the respiratory muscles have to work much harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsted|first=Emil Schwarz|last2=Faisal|first2=Azmy|last3=Jolley|first3=Caroline J.|last4=Swanton|first4=Laura L.|last5=Pavitt|first5=Matthew J.|last6=Luo|first6=Yuan-Ming|last7=Backer|first7=Vibeke|last8=Polkey|first8=Michael I.|last9=Hull|first9=James H.|date=2017-11-02|title=Increased respiratory neural drive and work of breathing in exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|pages=jap.00691.2017|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00691.2017|pmid=29097629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How common is EILO? ==
* The prevalence of EILO in adolescents and young adults appears to be in the range of 5–7% in northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johansson|first=Henrik|last2=Norlander|first2=Katarina|last3=Berglund|first3=Lars|last4=Janson|first4=Christer|last5=Malinovschi|first5=Andrei|last6=Nordvall|first6=Lennart|last7=Nordang|first7=Leif|last8=Emtner|first8=Margareta|date=January 2015|title=Prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction in a general adolescent population|journal=Thorax|volume=70|issue=1|pages=57–63|doi=10.1136/thoraxjnl-2014-205738|pmid=25380758}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=Pernille M.|last2=Thomsen|first2=S.

* Some, but not all studies report a higher female prevalence. Thus, in a study of 94 patients diagnosed using the CLE test, average age was ∼15 years, and 68% were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maat|first=Robert Christiaan|last2=Hilland|first2=Magnus|last3=Røksund|first3=Ola Drange|last4=Halvorsen|first4=Thomas|last5=Olofsson|first5=Jan|last6=Aarstad|first6=Hans Jørgen|last7=Heimdal|first7=John-Helge|date=October 2011|title=Exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction: natural history and effect of surgical treatment|journal=European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology: official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS): affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery|volume=268|issue=10|pages=1485–1492|doi=10.1007/s00405-011-1656-1|pmc=3166603|pmid=21643933}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In athletic individuals EILO appears to be a highly prevalent cause of cough and wheeze and can co-exist with [[Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction|EIB]]. In one study, of almost 90 athletes, with unexplained respiratory symptoms, EILO was found to be present in approximately a third of athletes, whilst EILO and EIB co-existed in one in ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Emil Walsted|last2=Hull|first2=James H.|last3=Backer|first3=Vibeke|date=November 2013|title=High prevalence of exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction in athletes|journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|volume=45|issue=11|pages=2030–2035|doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e318298b19a|pmid=23657163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical features ==
* Key clinical features often include:
** Difficulty 'catching a breath'
** Wheeze or whistling sound; typically when breathing in when exercising hard 
** Throat or upper chest discomfort
* Symptoms often start to improve from the time of exercise cessation / reducing exercise intensity
* No improvement with standard asthma medication (e.g. [[salbutamol]], [[Salbutamol|albuterol)]].

[[Image:Freedom-Fries-Menu.jpg|thumb|200px|Menu from a [[United States Congress|Congressional]] cafeteria featuring freedom fries.]]
'''Freedom fries''' was a [[political euphemism]] for [[French fries]] in the [[United States]]. The term was born in 2003 when the then [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on House Administration|Committee on House Administration]], [[Bob Ney]], renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias in response to [[France]]'s [[United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War|opposition]] to the proposed [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. Although originally supported with several restaurants changing their menus as well, the term fell out of use due to [[Public opinion on the Iraq War|declining support for the Iraq War]]. Following Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, it was quietly reverted.

==Background==
===French war opposition===
Following the [[September 11 attacks]] by [[Al-Qaeda]] and the declaration of a "[[War on Terror]]" by President [[George W. Bush]], an [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] was proposed. During the [[United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War|United Nations Security Council deliberations]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Dominique de Villepin]] made it clear France would neither support nor participate in the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/22/germany.france|title=France and Germany unite against Iraq war|date=January 22, 2003|accessdate=April 1, 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused some Americans to accuse France of betrayal, reigniting prior [[anti-French sentiment in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/beyond-freedom-fries-the-roots-of-american-francophobia/256253/|title=Beyond Freedom Fries: The Roots of American Francophobia|date=April 23, 2012|accessdate=April 2, 2013|author=Max Fisher|work=[[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial renaming===
Renaming was initiated in February 2003 by [[Beaufort, North Carolina]] "Cubbie's" restaurant owner Neal Rowland, who said he was motivated by similar actions against [[Germany]] in [[World War I]], when "[[sauerkraut]] was called liberty cabbage, and frankfurters were renamed [[hot dog]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5240572.stm|title=French fries back on House menu|date=August 2, 2006|accessdate=February 5, 2013|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bellantoni1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hill fries free to be French again|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/aug/2/20060802-125318-3981r/?page=2|accessdate=September 12, 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=August 2, 2006|author=Christina Bellantoni}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview about the name change, Rowland commented "since the French are backing down [from the war], French fries and French everything needs to be banned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,79038,00.html|title=Americans Just Say 'Non' to French Products|date=February 19, 2003|accessdate=April 2, 2013|work=[[Fox News Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, Rowland obtained a [[trademark]] registration for the term "freedom fries".&lt;ref name="ff_uspto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=76495776&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch|title=Latest Status Info, TM Reg. 3220999|work=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|date=March 11, 2003|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubbie’s owner Darius Ballou of the Morehead City, NC store also supported Rowland and did the same.

==U.S. House adoption==
[[File:Cubbies-Freedom Fries.jpg|thumb|right|Cubbie's, which was in Jones's district, is where the renaming originated.]]
On March 11, 2003, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] [[Bob Ney]] and [[Walter B. Jones]] directed the three House cafeterias to change all references to French fries and [[French toast]] on menus, and replace them with ''Freedom fries'' and ''Freedom toast'', respectively. Jones chose to follow Cubbie's example by circulating a letter to his colleagues advocating their renaming because, he said, "the French were 'sitting on the sidelines{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="bellantoni1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="toastcnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/03/11/sprj.irq.fries/|title=House cafeterias change names for 'french' fries and 'french' toast|date=March 12, 2003|accessdate=March 20, 2008|author=Sean Loughlin|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Ney was Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on House Administration]], the action did not require any vote, as the committee has authority over House cafeterias. According to a statement released by Ney, the renaming was intended to express displeasure with France's "continued refusal to stand with their U.S. allies". The statement further read: "This action today is a small but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure many on [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] have with our so-called ally, France."&lt;ref name="toast"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,80700,00.html|work=[[Fox News]]|title=House Now Serving 'Freedom Fries'|date=March 11, 2003|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about his view on the change, Jones said it was a "lighthearted gesture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/12/national/12FRIES.html|title=An Order of Fries, Please, but Do Hold the French|author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|date=March 12, 2003|accessdate=March 20, 2013|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
In response to the change, [[Embassy of France, Washington, D.C.|French Embassy]] spokeswoman [[Nathalie Loiseau]] commented "It's exactly a non-issue ...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44753">'''Genuine progress indicator''' ('''GPI''') is a [[Performance metric|metric]] that has been suggested to replace, or supplement, [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). The GPI is designed to take fuller account of the [[well-being]] of a nation, only a part of which pertains to the size of the nation's economy, by incorporating environmental and social factors which are not measured by GDP. For instance, some models of GPI decrease in value when the [[poverty]] rate increases.&lt;ref name="turk-and-bensel"&gt;{{cite book | title=Contemporary Environmental Issues| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Contemporary_Environmental_Issues.html?id=gBzZXwAACAAJ| last=Bensel| first=Terrence|author2=Turk, Jon| year=2011| publisher=Bridgepoint Education| id=1935966154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GPI separates the concept of societal progress from [[economic growth]].

The GPI is used in [[ecological economics]], "green" economics, sustainability and more inclusive types of economics. It factors in [[environmental footprint|environmental]] and [[carbon footprint]]s that businesses produce or eliminate, including in the forms of [[resource depletion]], [[pollution]] and long-term environmental damage.&lt;ref name="turk-and-bensel" /&gt; GDP is increased twice when pollution is created, since it increases once upon creation (as a side-effect of some valuable process) and again when the pollution is cleaned up; in contrast, GPI counts the initial pollution as a loss rather than a gain, generally equal to the amount it will cost to clean up later plus the cost of any negative impact the pollution will have in the mean time. While quantifying costs and benefits of these environmental and social [[Externality|externalities]] is a difficult task, "Earthster-type databases could bring more precision and currency to GPI's metrics."&lt;ref name="turk-and-bensel" /&gt; It has been noted that such data may also be embraced by those who attempt to "internalize externalities" by making companies pay the costs of the pollution they create (rather than having the government or society at large bear those costs) "by taxing their goods proportionally to their negative ecological and social impacts".&lt;ref name="turk-and-bensel" /&gt;

GPI is an attempt to measure whether the environmental impact and social costs of economic production and consumption in a country are negative or positive factors in overall health and well-being. By accounting for the costs borne by the society as a whole to repair or control pollution and poverty, GPI balances GDP spending against external costs. GPI advocates claim that it can more reliably measure economic progress, as it distinguishes between the overall "shift in the 'value basis' of a product, adding its ecological impacts into the equation".&lt;ref name="turk-and-bensel" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 10.3}} Comparatively speaking, the relationship between GDP and GPI is analogous to the relationship between the gross profit of a company and the net profit; the net profit is the gross profit minus the costs incurred, while the GPI is the GDP (value of all goods and services produced) minus the environmental and social costs. Accordingly, the GPI will be zero if the financial costs of poverty and pollution equal the financial gains in production of goods and services, all other factors being constant.

==Motivation==

Most [[economist]]s assess progress in people's [[welfare]] by comparing the gross domestic product over time—that is, by adding up the annual dollar value of all goods and services produced within a country over successive years. However, GDP was not intended to be used for such purpose. It is prone to [[productivism]] or [[consumerism]], over-valuing production and consumption of goods, and not reflecting improvement in human well-being. It also does not distinguish between money spent for new production and money spent to repair negative outcomes from previous expenditure. For example, it would treat as equivalent one million dollars spent to build new homes and one million dollars spent in aid relief to those whose homes have been destroyed, despite these expenditures arguably not representing the same kind of progress. This is relevant for example when considering the true costs of development that destroys wetlands and hence exacerbate flood damages. [[Simon Kuznets]], the inventor of the concept of GDP, noted in his first report to the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] in 1934:&lt;blockquote&gt;the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income. If the GDP is up, why is America down? Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns, and between the short and long run. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond GDP International Conference|url=http://www.oecd.org/site/worldforum06/38433373.pdf|website=OECD|publisher=Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some{{Who|date=June 2017}} have argued that an adequate measure must also take into account [[ecological yield]] and the ability of nature to provide [[ecosystem services|services]], and that these things are part of a more inclusive ideal of progress, which transcends the traditional focus on raw industrial production.

==Theoretical foundation==
The need for a GPI to supplement biased indicators such as GDP was highlighted by analyses of [[uneconomic growth]] in the 1980s, notably that of [[Marilyn Waring]], who studied biases in the [[United Nations System of National Accounts|UN System of National Accounts]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

By the early 1990s, there was a consensus in [[human development theory]] and [[ecological economics]] that growth in [[money supply]] was actually reflective of a loss of well-being: that lacks of essential natural and social services were being paid for in cash and that this was expanding the economy but degrading life.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The matter remains controversial and is a main issue between advocates of [[green economics]] and [[neoclassical economics]]. Neoclassical economists understand the limitations of GDP for measuring human well-being but nevertheless regard GDP as an important, though imperfect, measure of economic output and would be wary of too close an identification of GDP growth with aggregate human welfare. However, GDP tends to be reported as synonymous with economic progress by journalists and politicians, and the GPI seeks to correct this shorthand by providing a more encompassing measure.

Some economists, notably [[Herman Daly]], [[John B. Cobb]]&lt;ref name=cobbdaly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottlondon.com/reviews/daly.html|title=For the Common Good by Herman Daly &amp; John Cobb Jr. – A Book Review by Scott London|work=scottlondon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Philip Lawn,&lt;ref name=lawn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.org/measure/compendium/DisplayInitiative.aspx?id=1367|title=Initiative Details|work=iisd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; have asserted that a country's growth, increased goods production, and expanding services have both "costs" and "benefits"—not just the "benefits" that contribute to GDP. They assert that, in some situations, expanded production facilities damage the health, culture, and welfare of people. Growth that was in excess of sustainable norms (e.g., of [[ecological yield]]) had to be considered to be uneconomic. According to the "threshold hypothesis", developed by [[Manfred Max-Neef]], "when macroeconomic systems expand beyond a certain size, the additional benefits of growth are exceeded by the attendant costs" (Max-Neef 1995). This hypothesis is borne out in data comparing GDP/capita with GPI/capita from 17 countries. The graph demonstrates that, while GDP does increase overall well-being to a point, beyond $7,000 GDP/capita the increase in GPI is reduced or remains stagnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kubiszewski|first1=Ida|last2=Costanza|first2=Robert|last3=Franco|first3=Carol|last4=Lawn|first4=Philip|last5=Talberth|first5=John|last6=Jackson|first6=Tim|last7=Aymler|first7=Camille|journal= Ecological Economics|date=30 April 2013|volume=93 |pages=57–68 |title=Beyond GDP: Measuring and achieving global genuine progress |doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.04.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar trends can be seen when comparing GDP to life satisfaction as well as in a [[Gallup (company)|Gallup Poll]] published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deaton|first1=Angus|title=Ph.D.|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/104608/worldwide-residents-richer-nations-more-satisfied.aspx|website=Gallup|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lawn's model, the "costs" of economic activity include the following potential harmful effects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawn |first=Philip A. |year=2003 |title=A theoretical foundation to support the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW), Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), and other related indexes |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=105–118 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00258-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Cost of resource depletion
*Cost of [[crime]]
*Cost of [[ozone depletion]]
*Cost of [[family breakdown]]
*Cost of [[air pollution|air]], [[water pollution|water]], and [[noise pollution]]
*Loss of [[arable land|farmland]]
*Loss of [[wetland]]s

Analysis by [[Robert Costanza]] also around 1995 of [[ecosystem services|nature's services]] and their value showed that a great deal of degradation of nature's ability to clear waste, prevent erosion, pollinate crops, etc., was being done in the name of monetary profit opportunity: this was adding to GDP but causing a great deal of long term risk in the form of mudslides, reduced yields, lost species, water pollution, etc. Such effects have been very marked in areas that suffered serious [[deforestation]], notably [[Haiti]], [[Indonesia]], and some coastal [[mangrove]] regions of [[India]] and [[South America]]. Some of the worst land abuses for instance have been [[shrimp farm]]ing operations that destroyed mangroves, evicted families, left coastal lands salted and useless for agriculture, but generated a significant cash profit for those who were able to control the export market in shrimp. This has become a signal example to those who contest the idea that GDP growth is necessarily desirable.

GPI systems generally try to take account of these problems by incorporating [[sustainability]]: whether a country's economic activity over a year has left the country with a better or worse future possibility of repeating at least the same level of economic activity in the long run. For example, agricultural activity that uses replenishing water resources, such as river runoff, would score a higher GPI than the same level of agricultural activity that drastically lowers the water table by pumping irrigation water from wells.

==="Income" vs. "capital depletion"===

[[John Hicks|Hicks]] (1946) pointed out that the practical purpose of calculating income is to indicate the maximum amount that people can produce and consume without undermining their capacity to produce and consume the same amount in the future. From a national income perspective, it is necessary to answer the following question: "Can a nation's entire GDP be consumed without undermining its ability to produce and consume the same GDP in the future?" This question is largely ignored in contemporary economics but fits under the idea of [[Sustainability#Economic dimension|sustainability]].

==In legislative decisions==
The best-known attempts to apply the concepts of GPI to legislative decisions are probably the Atlantic indicator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpiatlantic.org|title=GPI Atlantic|work=gpiatlantic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; invented by Ronald Colman for [[Atlantic Canada]], the Alberta GPI&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiscallygreen.ca/gpi/index.php Alberta GPI]&lt;/ref&gt; created by ecological economist Mark Anielski&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anielski.com/Staff.htm Mark Anielski] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707143941/http://www.anielski.com/Staff.htm |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to measure the long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability of the province of [[Alberta]] and the "environmental and sustainable development indicators" used by the [[Government of Canada]] to measure its own progress to achieving well-being goals: its Environment and Sustainable Development Indicators Initiative (Canada)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrtee-trnee.com/eng/issues/programs/indicators/indicators.php Environment and Sustainable Development Indicators Initiative (Canada)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210042900/http://www.nrtee-trnee.com/eng/issues/programs/indicators/indicators.php |date=2008-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an effort to justify [[state services]] in GPI terms. It assigns the Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development (Canada),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/domino/cesd_cedd.nsf/html/menu8_e.html Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development (Canada)]&lt;/ref&gt; an officer in the [[Auditor-General of Canada]]'s office, to perform the analysis and report to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. However, Canada continues to state its overall budgetary targets in terms of reducing its [[debt to GDP ratio]], which implies that GDP increase and debt reduction in some combination are its main priorities.

In the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]] the [[Metropole]] efforts and the [[London Health Observatory]] methods are equivalents focused mostly on urban lifestyle.

The EU and Canadian efforts are among the most advanced in any of the [[G8]] or [[OECD]] nations, but there are parallel efforts to measure [[quality of life]] or [[standard of living]] in [[health]] (not strictly [[wealth]]) terms in all [[developed country|developed nation]]s.  This has also been a recent focus of the [[labour movement]].

==Calculation==

The calculation of GPI presented in the simplified form is the following:

GPI = A + B - C - D + I

A is income weighted private consumption

B is value of non-market services generating welfare

C is private defensive cost of natural deterioration

D is cost of deterioration of nature and natural resources

I is increase in capital stock and balance of international trade

The GPI indicator is based on the concept of sustainable income, presented by economist John Hicks (1948).  The sustainable income is the amount a person or an economy can consume during one period without decreasing his or her consumption during the next period. In the same manner, GPI depicts the state of welfare in the society by taking into account the ability to maintain welfare on at least the same level in the future.

==Components==

The Genuine Progress Indicator is measured by 26 indicators which can be divided into three main categories: Economic, Environmental, and Social. Some regions, nations, or states may adjust the verbiage slightly to accommodate their particular scenario. For example, the GPI template uses the phrase "Carbon Dioxide Emissions Damage" whereas the state of Maryland uses "Cost of Climate Change"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maryland GPI Indicators |url=http://www.dnr.maryland.gov/mdgpi/indicators.asp |website=Maryland Genuine Progress Indicator |publisher=MD DNR |accessdate=2014-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129034347/http://www.dnr.maryland.gov/mdgpi/indicators.asp |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it also accounts for other greenhouse gases (GHG) such as methane and nitrous oxide.

==Development in the United States==
Non-profit organizations and universities have measured the GPI of Vermont, Maryland, Colorado, Ohio, and Utah. These efforts have incited government action in some states. As of 2014, [[Vermont]], [[Maryland]], Washington and Hawai'i have passed state government initiatives to consider GPI&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.gpiinthestates.org/states-using-gpi)&lt;/ref&gt; in budgeting decisions, with a focus on long-term cost and benefits.

In 2009, the state of Maryland formed a coalition of representatives from several state government departments in search of a metric that would factor social well-being into the more traditional gross product indicators of the economy. The metric would help determine the sustainability of growth and economic progress against social and environmental factors typically left out of national indicators. The GPI was chosen as a comprehensive measure of sustainability as it has a well-accepted scientific methodology that can be adopted by other states and compared over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MD-GPI Background &amp; Methodology |url=http://www.dnr.maryland.gov/mdgpi/bandm.asp |website=Maryland Genuine Progress Indicator |publisher=MDDNR |accessdate=16 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128201744/http://www.dnr.maryland.gov/mdgpi/bandm.asp |archivedate=28 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maryland's GPI trends are comparable to other states and nations that have measured their GPI in that [[Gross State Product]] (GSP) and GPI have diverged over the past four decades where GSP has increased more rapidly than GPI. While economic elements of GPI have increased overall (with a significant drop off during the [[Great Recession]]), social well-being has stagnated, with any values added being cancelled out by costs deducted, and environmental indicators, while improving slightly, are always considered costs. Combined, these elements bring the GPI below GSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maryland Genuine Progress Indicator Overview |url=http://www.dnr.maryland.gov/mdgpi/mdgpioverview.asp |website=Maryland Genuine Progress Indicator |publisher=MD DNR |accessdate=16 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128183818/http://www.dnr.maryland.gov/mdgpi/mdgpioverview.asp |archivedate=28 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maryland's GPI did increase by two points from 2010 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.maryland.gov/dnr/2013/06/17/governor-omalley-hosts-gpi-summit/|title=Governor O’Malley Hosts GPI Summit|work=maryland.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The calculation methodology of GPI was first adapted to US data in the late-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.green.maryland.gov/mdgpi/pdfs/GPI-2006Report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Results show that GDP has increased substantially. At the same time, the GPI has stagnated. Thus, according to GPI theory, economic growth in the US, i.e., the growth of GDP, has not increased the welfare of the people during last 30 years. So far, GPI time-series have been calculated for the US and Australia as well as for several of their states. In addition, GPI has been calculated for Austria, Canada, Chile, France, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Scotland, and the rest of the UK.

==Development in Finland==
The GPI time-series 1945 to 2011 for Finland have been calculated by [[Statistics Finland]]. The calculation closely followed the US methodology. The results show that in the 1970s and 1980s economic growth, as measured by GDP, clearly increased welfare, measured by the GPI. After the economic recession of the early-1990s the GDP continued to grow, but the GPI stayed on a lower level. This indicates a widening gap between the trends of GDP and GPI that began in the early-1990s. In the 1990s and 2000s the growth of GDP has not benefited the average Finn. If measured by GPI, sustainable economic welfare has actually decreased due to environmental hazards that have accumulated in the environment. The Finnish GPI time series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/84610133/Energy-and-material-flows|title=Energy and material flows|work=Docstoc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been updated by Dr Jukka Hoffrén at Statistics Finland.

==Development in Finland regions==

Within EU's Interreg IV C FRESH Project (Forwarding Regional Environmental Sustainable Hierarchies) GPI time-series were calculated to Päijät-Häme, Kainuu and South-Ostrobotnia (Etelä-Pohjanmaa) regions in 2009-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paijat-hame.fi/easydata/customers/paijathame/files/ph_liitto/tiedottaa/gpi-report_eng_nettiin.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105223221/http://www.paijat-hame.fi/easydata/customers/paijathame/files/ph_liitto/tiedottaa/gpi-report_eng_nettiin.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2011 these calculations were completed with GPI calculations for the Lappland, Northern Ostrobothnia (Pohjois-Pohjanmaa) and Central-Ostrobothnia (Keski-Pohjanmaa) regions.

==Criticism==
GDP is held up as a value neutral measure.  It is relatively straightforward to measure compared to GPI. Competing measures like GPI define well-being to mean things that the definers ideologically support. Therefore, opponents of GPI claim that GPI cannot function to measure the goals of a diverse, plural society. Supporters of GDP as a measure of societal well-being claim that competing measures such as GPI are more vulnerable to political manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goossens|first1=Yanne|title=Alternative progress indicators to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a means towards sustainable development|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2007/385672/IPOL-ENVI_ET(2007)385672_EN.pdf|website=European Parliament|publisher=Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (EVNI)|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Misleading|date=August 2012}}Finnish economists Mika Maliranta and Niku Määttänen write that the problem of alternative development indexes is their attempt to combine things that are incommensurable. It is hard to say what they exactly indicate and difficult to make decisions based on them. They can be compared to an indicator that shows the mean of a car's velocity and the amount of fuel left.

They add that it indeed seems as if the economy has to grow in order for the people to even remain as happy as they are at present. In Japan, for example, the degree of happiness expressed by the citizens in polls has been declining since the early 1990s, the period when Japan's economic growth stagnated.&lt;ref name=mm&gt;"Politiikanteon ohjaamiseen ei tarvita 'onnellisuusmittareita'", professor Mika Maliranta and research manager Niku Määttänen, [[Helsingin Sanomat]] 2011-02-06, page C6&lt;/ref&gt;

GPI will function as a "balance sheet," taking into consideration that some income sources are very costly and contribute a negative profit overall.

'''Health economics''' is a branch of [[economics]] concerned with issues related to efficiency, effectiveness, value and behavior in the production and consumption of [[health]] and [[healthcare]].  In broad terms, health economists study the functioning of healthcare systems and health-affecting behaviors such as smoking.

A seminal 1963 article by [[Kenneth Arrow]], often credited with giving rise to health economics as a discipline, drew conceptual distinctions between health and other goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrow|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Factors that distinguish health economics from other areas include extensive [[government intervention]], intractable [[uncertainty]] in several dimensions, [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]], [[barriers to entry]],  [[Externality|externalities]] and the presence of a third-party agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Phelps |first=Charles E. |year=2003 |title=Health Economics |edition=3rd |publisher=Addison Wesley |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-321-06898-9 }} [http://www.lavoisier.fr/notice/frLWOS6SXAORW32O.html Description] and  2nd ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JajjFgTXwP8C&amp;pg=PT18 preview].&lt;/ref&gt;  In healthcare, the third-party agent is the physician, who makes purchasing decisions (e.g., whether to order a lab test, prescribe a medication, perform a surgery, etc.) while being insulated from the price of the product or service.

Health economists evaluate multiple types of financial information: costs, charges and expenditures.

Uncertainty is intrinsic to health, both in patient outcomes and financial concerns. The knowledge gap that exists between a physician and a patient creates a situation of distinct advantage for the physician, which is called ''asymmetric information''.

Externalities arise frequently when considering health and health care, notably in the context of infectious disease. For example, making an effort to avoid catching the [[common cold]] affects people other than the decision maker.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, Victor R. (1987).

==Scope==
The scope of health economics is neatly encapsulated by [[Alan Williams (economist)|Alan Williams]]' "[[plumbing diagram]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Williams |first=A. |year=1987 |chapter=Health economics: the cheerful face of a dismal science |editor-last=Williams |editor-first=A. |title=Health and Economics |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; dividing the discipline into eight distinct topics:
* What influences health? (other than healthcare)
* What is health and what is its value?
* The [[Demand (economics)|demand]] for healthcare
* The [[Supply (economics)|supply]] of healthcare
* [[Micro-economic]] evaluation at [[therapy|treatment]] level
* [[Market equilibrium]]
* Evaluation at whole system level
* Planning, [[budgeting]] and monitoring mechanisms.

==Healthcare demand==
The demand for healthcare is a [[derived demand]] from the demand for health. Healthcare is demanded as a means for consumers to achieve a larger stock of "health capital." The demand for health is unlike most other goods because individuals allocate resources in order to both consume and produce health.

The above description gives three roles of persons in health economics. The World Health Report (p.&amp;nbsp;52) states that people take four roles in the healthcare:
# Contributors
# Citizens
# Provider
# Consumers

[[Michael Grossman (economist)|Michael Grossman]]'s 1972 [[Grossman model of health demand|model of health production]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Grossman |first=Michael |title=On the Concept of Health Capital and the Demand for Health |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |year=1972 |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=223–55 |doi=10.1086/259880 |citeseerx=10.1.1.604.7202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been extremely influential in this field of study and has several unique elements that make it notable.  Grossman's model views each individual as both a producer and a consumer of health.  Health is treated as a stock which degrades over time in the absence of "investments" in health, so that health is viewed as a sort of [[Social capital|capital]]. The model acknowledges that health is both a [[Good (economics)|consumption good]] that yields direct satisfaction and [[utility]], and an [[investment good]], which yields satisfaction to consumers indirectly through fewer sick days. Investment in health is costly as consumers must trade off time and resources devoted to health, such as exercising at a local gym, against other goals. These factors are used to determine the optimal level of health that an individual will demand. The model makes predictions over the effects of changes in prices of healthcare and other goods, labour market outcomes such as employment and wages, and technological changes. These predictions and other predictions from models extending Grossman's 1972 paper form the basis of much of the econometric research conducted by health economists.

In Grossman's model, the optimal level of investment in health occurs where the [[marginal cost]] of health capital is equal to the [[marginal benefit]]. With the passing of time, health depreciates at some rate δ. The interest rate faced by the consumer is denoted by r. The marginal cost of health capital can be found by adding these variables: &lt;math&gt;MC_{HK}=r+\delta\,&lt;/math&gt;. The marginal benefit of health capital is the rate of return from this capital in both market and non-market sectors. In this model, the optimal health stock can be impacted by factors like age, wages and education. As an example, &lt;math&gt;\delta\,&lt;/math&gt; increases with age, so it becomes more and more costly to attain the same level of health capital or health stock as one ages. Age also decreases the marginal benefit of health stock.  The optimal health stock will therefore decrease as one ages.

Beyond issues of the fundamental, "real" demand for medical care derived from the desire to have good health (and thus influenced by the production function for health) is the important distinction between the "marginal benefit" of medical care (which is always associated with this "real demand" curve based on derived demand), and a separate "effective demand" curve, which summarizes the amount of medical care demanded at particular market prices.  Because most medical care is not purchased from providers directly, but is rather obtained at subsidized prices due to insurance, the out-of-pocket prices faced by consumers are typically much lower than the market price.  The consumer sets MB=MC out of pocket, and so the "effective demand" will have a separate relationship between price and quantity than will the "marginal benefit curve" or real demand relationship.  This distinction is often described under the rubric of "ex-post moral hazard" (which is again distinct from ex-ante moral hazard, which is found in any type of market with insurance).

==Health technology assessment==
{{main|Health technology assessment}}
[[Economic evaluation]], and in particular [[cost-effectiveness analysis]], has become a fundamental part of technology appraisal processes for agencies in a number of countries. The Institute for Quality and Economy in Health Services ([[Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen]] – IQWiG) in Germany and the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in the United Kingdom, for example, both consider the cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals entering the market.

Some agencies, including NICE, recommend the use of [[cost–utility analysis]] (CUA). This approach measures outcomes in a composite metric of both length and quality of life, the [[Quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY).

==Healthcare markets==
The five health markets typically analyzed are:
* Healthcare [[financing]] market
* [[Physician]] and [[nurse]]s services market
* [[Institutional]] services market
* [[Input factors]] markets
* Professional [[education]] market

Although assumptions of textbook models of economic markets apply reasonably well to healthcare markets, there are important deviations. Many states have created [[Health insurance in the United States#State risk pools|risk pools]] in which relatively healthy enrollees subsidise the care of the rest. Insurers must cope with [[adverse selection]] which occurs when they are unable to fully predict the medical expenses of enrollees; adverse selection can destroy the risk pool. Features of insurance market risk pools, such as group purchases, preferential selection ("cherry-picking"), and [[preexisting condition]] exclusions are meant to cope with adverse selection.

Insured patients are naturally less concerned about healthcare costs than they would if they paid the full price of care. The resulting [[moral hazard]] drives up costs, as shown by the famous [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]]. Insurers use several techniques to limit the costs of moral hazard, including imposing copayments on patients and limiting physician incentives to provide costly care. Insurers often compete by their choice of service offerings, cost sharing requirements, and limitations on physicians.

Consumers in healthcare markets often suffer from a lack of adequate information about what services they need to buy and which providers offer the best value proposition. Health economists have documented a problem with [[supplier induced demand]], whereby providers base treatment recommendations on economic, rather than medical criteria. Researchers have also documented substantial "practice variations", whereby the treatment also on service availability to rein in inducement and practice variations.

Some economists argue that requiring doctors to have a medical license constrains inputs, inhibits innovation, and increases cost to consumers while largely only benefiting the doctors themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Svorny |first=Shirley |year=2004 |title=Licensing Doctors: Do Economists Agree? |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=279–305 |url=http://www.aier.org/ejw/archive/complete-issues/doc_view/3685-ejw-200408?tmpl=component&amp;format=raw }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==

===Medical economics===
Often used synonymously with health economics, ''medical economics'', according to [[Anthony J. Culyer|Culyer]],&lt;ref&gt;[[A.J. Culyer]] (1989) "A Glossary of the more common terms encountered in health economics" in MS Hersh-Cochran and KP Cochran (Eds.) ''Compendium of English Language Course Syllabi and Textbooks in Health Economics'', Copenhagen, WHO, 215–34&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of economics concerned with the application of economic theory to phenomena and problems associated typically with the second and third health market outlined above. Typically, however, it pertains to cost–benefit analysis of pharmaceutical products and cost-effectiveness of various medical treatments. Medical economics often uses [[mathematical model]]s to synthesise data from [[biostatistics]] and [[epidemiology]] for support of medical [[decision-making]], both for individuals and for wider health policy.

===Behavioral economics===
[[Peter R. Orszag|Peter Orszag]] has suggested that [[behavioral economics]] is an important factor for improving the healthcare system, but that relatively little progress has been made when compared to retirement policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter R. Orszag|Peter Orszag]], [http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/96xx/doc9673/08-07-Presentation_RRC.pdf "Behavioral Economics: Lessons from Retirement Research for Health Care and Beyond,"] Presentation to the Retirement Research Consortium, August 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The relevance of behavioural economics in healthcare is further highlighted in Vuong et al. (2018).&lt;ref name=Vuongetal2018b&gt;{{cite journal|title=Healthcare consumers' sensitivity to costs: a reflection on behavioural economics from an emerging market|journal=Palgrave Communications|volume=4|issue=1|pages=70|date=June 19, 2018|doi=10.1057/s41599-018-0127-3|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0127-3|accessdate=June 19, 2018|last1=Vuong|first1=Thu-Trang|last2=Nguyen|first2=Hong-Kong|last3=Ho|first3=Tung-Manh|last4=Vuong|first4=Quan-Hoang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health economics===
Mental health economics incorporates a vast array of subject matters, ranging from [[pharmacoeconomics]] to [[Labour economics|labor economics]] and [[welfare economics]]. Mental health can be directly related to economics by the potential of affected individuals to contribute as human capital. In 2009 Currie and Stabile published "Mental Health in Childhood and Human Capital" in which they assessed how common childhood mental health problems may alter the human capital accumulation of affected children.&lt;ref&gt;Currie, Janet and Mark Stabile. "Mental Health in Childhood and Human Capital". ''The Problems of Disadvantaged Youth: An Economic Perspective'' ed. J. Gruber. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Externalities may include the influence that affected individuals have on surrounding human capital, such as at the workplace or in the home.&lt;ref name="Evers, S. 2007"&gt;{{citation |last1=Evers |first1=S. |first2=L. |last2=Salvador–Carulla |first3=V. |last3=Halsteinli |first4=D. |last4=McDaid |author5=MHEEN Group |title=Implementing mental health economic evaluation evidence: Building a Bridge between theory and practice |journal=Journal of Mental Health |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=223–41 |year=April 2007 |doi=10.1080/09638230701279881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the economy also affects the individual, particularly in light of globalization. For example, studies in India, where there is an increasingly high occurrence of western outsourcing, have demonstrated a growing hybrid identity in young professionals who face very different sociocultural expectations at the workplace and in at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Bhavsar |first1=V. |first2=D. |last2=Bhugra |title=Globalization: Mental health and social economic factors |journal=Global Social Policy |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=378–96 |date=December 2008 |doi=10.1177/1468018108095634 |url=http://gsp.sagepub.com/content/8/3/378.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental health economics presents a unique set of challenges to researchers. Individuals with cognitive disabilities may not be able to communicate preferences. These factors represent challenges in terms of placing value on the mental health status of an individual, especially in relation to the individual's potential as human capital. Further, employment statistics are often used in mental health economic studies as a means of evaluating individual productivity; however, these statistics do not capture "[[presenteeism]]", when an individual is at work with a lowered productivity level, quantify the loss of non-paid working time, or capture externalities such as having an affected family member. Also, considering the variation in global wage rates or in societal values, statistics used may be contextually, geographically confined, and study results may not be internationally applicable.&lt;ref name="Evers, S. 2007"/&gt;

Though studies have demonstrated mental healthcare to reduce overall healthcare costs, demonstrate efficacy, and reduce employee absenteeism while improving employee functioning, the availability of comprehensive mental health services is in decline. Petrasek and Rapin (2002) cite the three main reasons for this decline as (1) stigma and privacy concerns, (2) the difficulty of quantifying medical savings and (3) physician incentive to medicate without specialist referral.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Petrasek M, Rapin L |title=The mental health paradox |journal=Benefits Q |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=73–77 |year=2002 |pmid=12004583 |last2=Rapin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evers et al. (2009) have suggested that improvements could be made by promoting more active dissemination of mental health economic analysis, building partnerships through policy-makers and researchers, and employing greater use of [[knowledge broker]]s.&lt;ref name="Evers, S. 2007"/&gt;

'''Howard Dully''' (born November 30, 1948) is one of the youngest recipients of the [[wikt:transorbital|transorbital]] [[lobotomy]], a procedure performed on him when he was 12 years old. Dully received international attention in 2005, following the broadcasting of his story on [[National Public Radio]]. Subsequently, in 2007, he published a New York Times Best Seller [[memoir]], ''My Lobotomy'', a story of the hardships of his lobotomy, co-authored by [[Charles Fleming (author)|Charles Fleming]].

==Biography==
Dully was born on November 30, 1948, in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], the eldest son of Rodney and June Louise Pierce Dully. Following the death of his mother from [[cancer]] in 1954, Dully's father married single mother Shirley Lucille Hardin in 1955.

[[Neurologist]] [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] had diagnosed Dully as suffering from childhood [[schizophrenia]] since age 4, although numerous other medical and psychiatric professionals who had seen Dully did not detect a psychiatric disorder. In 1960, at 12 years of age, Dully was submitted by his father and stepmother for a trans-orbital lobotomy, performed by Dr. Freeman. During the procedure, a long, sharp instrument called an [[orbitoclast]] was inserted through each of Dully's eye sockets 7&amp;nbsp;cm (2.75&amp;nbsp;inches) into his brain.

Dully was institutionalized for years as a juvenile (in Agnews State Hospital as a minor); transferred to Rancho Linda School in San Jose, California, a school for children with behavior problems; [[Incarceration|incarcerated]]; and was eventually [[Homelessness|homeless]] and an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]]. After becoming sober and getting a college degree in [[computer information systems]], he became a California state certified behind-the-wheel instructor for a [[school bus]] company in [[San Jose, California]].

In his 50s, with the assistance of [[National Public Radio]] [[radio producer|producer]] [[David Isay]], Dully started to research what had happened to him as a child. By this time, both his stepmother and Dr. Freeman were dead, and due to the aftereffects of the surgery, he was unable to rely on his own memories. He traveled the country with Isay and Piya Kochhar, speaking with members of his family, relatives of other lobotomy patients, and relatives of Dr. Freeman, and also gaining access to Freeman's archives. Dully first relayed his story on a [[National Public Radio]] broadcast in 2005, prior to co-authoring a memoir published in 2007.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |first= Grimes |last= William |title= Spikes in the Brain, and a Search for Answers |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/books/14book.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22My%20Lobotomy%22&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin |format= |work= [[The New York Times]] |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date= 2007-09-14|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Public Radio==
On November 16, 2005, Isay broadcast Dully's search as a [[David Isay|Sound Portraits]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] on NPR. According to ''[[USA Today]]'', the documentary, which ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes as "celebrated",&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; "created a firestorm".&lt;ref name="USA"/&gt; The broadcast, aired on ''[[All Things Considered]]'', drew more listener response than any other program that had ever aired, and by May 2006, the [[Crown Publishing Group]] had negotiated worldwide rights to publish Dully's story in book form.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. (2006-05-15) "No-brainer. Crown Books Corp. acquires rights to Howard Dully's book." ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Dully published ''My Lobotomy'', a memoir co-authored by Charles Fleming. The memoir relates Dully's experiences as a child, the effect of the procedure on his life, his efforts as an adult to discover why the medically unnecessary procedure was performed on him and the effect of the radio broadcast on his life.

The book was critically well received. ''The New York Times'' described it as "harrowing", "one of the saddest stories you'll ever read."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; ''USA Today'' called it "at once horrifying and inspiring".&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite news |first=Deirdre |last=Donahue |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Four memoirs of family ties&amp;mdash;and family lies |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2007-09-26-memoirs_N.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher= |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' critiqued it as "a gruesome but compulsively readable tale, ultimately redemptive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Edward |last=Guthmann |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= His lobotomy, his recovery, in his words |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article/article?f=/c/a/2007/09/26/DDUIS7VP6.DTL |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher=sfgate |date= 2007-09-26 |accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[The Observer]]'' characterized the book as "a forceful account of his survival" that "sheds light on the man who subjected him to one of the most brutal surgical procedures in medical history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Elizabeth | last = Day | title = He was bad, so they put an ice pick in his brain... | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jan/13/neuroscience.medicalscience | publisher = [[The Observer]] | date = 2008-01-13 | accessdate=2008-09-02 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' described it as "uncomfortable reading", noting that "[i]t is, given the circumstances, astonishingly free of rancour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Nigel | last = Hawkes | title = Nigel Hawkes reviews two new books about the brain | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article3597158.ece | publisher = [[The Times]] | date = 2008-03-22 | accessdate = 2009-09-02 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last section of the memoir, entitled "One Last Word," Dully compared his [[lobotomy]] to young children today who are diagnosed with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]] or [[ADD]] without a second opinion, and are subsequently medicated with powerful medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleming|first1=Howard Dully with Charles|title=My lobotomy|date=2007|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-38126-2|page=268–269|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''India Organic''' is a [[Organic certification|certification mark for organically farmed food]] products manufactured in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianspices.com/html/np_organiccert.htm Spices Board of India. 'Organic certification mark'.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802024444/http://www.indianspices.com/html/np_organiccert.htm |date=August 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[certification mark]] certifies that an [[organic food]] product conforms to the National Standards for Organic Products&lt;ref&gt;[http://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/organic/ORGANIC_CONTENTS/National_Programme_for_Organic_Production.htm APEDA. 'National Standards for Organic Products.']&lt;/ref&gt; established in 2000.

Those standards ensures that the product or the raw materials used in the product were grown through [[organic farming]], without the use of chemical [[fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s, or induced hormones. The certification is issued by testing centres accredited by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/organic/Organic_Products.htm Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority. 'Organic products'.]&lt;/ref&gt; under the ''National Program for Organic Production'' of the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref name="ecoworld"&gt;[http://www.ecoworld.com/atmosphere/effects/organic-farming-in-india.html Ecoworld. Organic Farming in India.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabard.org/fileupload/databank/occasionalpapers/oc%2038.pdf Nabard. Paper on organic farming.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the standards are in effect since 2000, the certification scheme and hence the certification mark came into existence in 2002.&lt;ref name="ecoworld" /&gt;

'''Intermittent explosive disorder''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''IED''') is a behavioral disorder characterized by explosive outbursts of [[anger]] and violence, often to the point of rage, that are disproportionate to the situation at hand (e.g., impulsive screaming triggered by relatively inconsequential events). Impulsive aggression is not premeditated, and is defined by a disproportionate reaction to any provocation, real or perceived. Some individuals have reported affective changes prior to an outburst (e.g., [[Stress (biology)|tension]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] changes, energy changes, etc.).&lt;ref name=McElroy&gt;{{cite journal |author=McElroy SL |title=Recognition and treatment of DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=60 Suppl 15 |issue= |pages=12–6 |year=1999 |pmid=10418808 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disorder is currently categorized in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-5) under the "Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders" category. The disorder itself is not easily characterized and often exhibits comorbidity with other mood disorders, particularly [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name=27cases&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McElroy SL, Soutullo CA, Beckman DA, Taylor P, Keck PE |title=DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder: a report of 27 cases |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=203–10; quiz 211 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9590677 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v59n0411|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals diagnosed with IED report their outbursts as being brief (lasting less than an hour), with a variety of bodily symptoms (sweating, stuttering, chest tightness, twitching, [[palpitation]]s) reported by a third of one sample.&lt;ref&gt;Tamam, L., Eroğlu, M., Paltacı, Ö. (2011). "Intermittent explosive disorder". ''Current Approaches in Psychiatry'', '''3'''(3): 387–425.&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressive acts are frequently reported accompanied by a sensation of relief and in some cases pleasure, but often followed by later [[remorse]].

==Diagnosis==

===DSM-5 diagnosis===
The current [[DSM-5]] criteria for Intermittent Explosive Disorder include:&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association"&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recurrent outbursts that demonstrate an inability to control impulses, including either of the following:
**Verbal aggression (tantrums, verbal arguments or fights) or physical aggression that occurs twice in a week-long period for at least three months and does not lead to destruction of property or physical injury (Criterion A1)
**Three outbursts that involve injury or destruction within a year-long period (Criterion A2)
*Aggressive behavior is grossly disproportionate to the magnitude of the psychosocial stressors (Criterion B)
*The outbursts are not premeditated and serve no premeditated purpose (Criterion C)
*The outbursts cause distress or impairment of functioning, or lead to financial or legal consequences (Criterion D)
*The individual must be at least six years old (Criterion E)
*The recurrent outbursts cannot be explained by another mental disorder and are not the result of another medical disorder or substance use (Criterion F)

It is important to note that DSM-5 now includes two separate criteria for types of aggressive outbursts (A1 and A2) which have empirical support:&lt;ref&gt;Coccaro, EF, Lee, R, &amp; McCloskey, MF (2014). Validity of the new A1 and A2 criteria for DSM-5 intermittent explosive disorder. ''Comprehensive Psychology'', 55(2). doi: 10.1016/j.comppsych.2013.09.007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Criterion A1: Episodes of verbal and/or non damaging, nondestructive, or non injurious physical assault that occur, on average, twice weekly for three months. These could include temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments/fights, or assault without damage. This criterion includes high frequency/low intensity outbursts.
* Criterion A2: More severe destructive/assaultive episodes which are more infrequent and occur, on average, three times within a twelve-month period. These could be destroying an object without regard to value, assaulting an animal or individual. This criterion includes high-intensity/low-frequency outbursts.

===DSM-IV diagnosis===
The past [[DSM-IV]] criteria for IED were similar to the current criteria, however verbal aggression was not considered as part of the diagnostic criteria. The DSM-IV diagnosis was characterized by the occurrence of discrete episodes of failure to resist aggressive impulses that result in violent assault or destruction of property. Additionally, the degree of aggressiveness expressed during an episode should be grossly disproportionate to provocation or precipitating psychosocial stressor, and, as previously stated, diagnosis is made when certain other mental disorders have been ruled out, e.g., a head injury, [[Alzheimer's disease]], etc., or due to [[substance abuse]] or medication.&lt;ref name=27cases/&gt; Diagnosis is made using a psychiatric interview to affective and behavioral symptoms to the criteria listed in the DSM-IV.

The [[DSM-IV-TR]] was very specific in its definition of Intermittent Explosive Disorder which was defined, essentially, by exclusion of other conditions. The diagnosis required:
# several episodes of impulsive behavior that result in serious damage to either persons or property, wherein
# the degree of the aggressiveness is grossly disproportionate to the circumstances or provocation, and
# the episodic violence cannot be better accounted for by another mental or physical medical condition.

===Differential diagnosis===

Many psychiatric disorders and some substance use disorders are associated with increased aggression and are frequently comorbid with IED, often making differential diagnosis difficult. Individuals with IED are, on average, four times more likely to develop depressive or anxiety disorders, and three times more likely to develop substance use disorders.&lt;ref name=Coccaro2012&gt;Coccaro, E.F. (2012). Intermittent explosive disorder as a disorder of impulsive aggression for DSM-5. "American Journal of Psychiatry," 169. 577-588.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bipolar disorder has been linked to increased agitation and aggressive behavior in some individuals, but for these individuals aggressiveness is limited to manic and/or depressive episodes, whereas individuals with IED experience aggressive behavior even during [[Euthymia (medicine)|periods with a neutral or positive mood]].&lt;ref&gt;Coccaro, EF (2000). Intermittent explosive disorder. ''Current Psychiatry Reports'', 2:67-71.&lt;/ref&gt; In one clinical study, the two disorders co-occurred 60% of the time. Patients report manic-like symptoms occurring just before outbursts and continuing throughout. According to a study, the average onset age of IED was around five years earlier than the onset age of bipolar disorder, indicating a possible correlation between the two.&lt;ref name=Coccaro2012 /&gt; 
Similarly, alcohol and other [[substance use disorder]]s may exhibit increased aggressiveness, but unless this aggression is experienced outside of periods of acute intoxication and withdrawal, no diagnosis of IED is given. For chronic disorders, such as [[PTSD]], it is important to assess whether the level of aggression met IED criteria prior to the development of another disorder. In [[antisocial personality disorder]], interpersonal aggression is usually instrumental in nature (i.e., motivated by tangible rewards), whereas IED is more of an impulsive, unpremeditated reaction to situational stress.&lt;ref name="Aboujaoude"&gt;Aboujaoude, E., &amp; Koran, L. M. (2010). ''Impulsive control disorders''. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment is attempted through both [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and psychotropic medication regimens, though the pharmaceutical options have shown limited success.&lt;ref name="McCloskey"&gt;McCloskey, M.S., Noblett, K.L., Deffenbacher, J.L, Gollan, J.K., Coccaro, E.F. (2008) Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Intermittent Explosive Disorder: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial. 76(5), 876-886.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therapy aids in helping the patient recognize the impulses in hopes of achieving a level of awareness and control of the outbursts, along with treating the emotional stress that accompanies these episodes.  Multiple drug regimens are frequently indicated for IED patients. Cognitive Relaxation and Coping Skills Therapy (CRCST) has shown preliminary success in both group and individual settings compared to waitlist control groups.&lt;ref name="McCloskey" /&gt; This therapy consists of 12 sessions, the first three focusing on relaxation training, then [[cognitive restructuring]], then [[exposure therapy]]. The final sessions focus on resisting aggressive impulses and other preventative measures.&lt;ref name="McCloskey" /&gt;

[[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs) such as [[fluoxetine]], [[fluvoxamine]], and [[sertraline]] appear to alleviate some pathopsychological symptoms.&lt;ref name=McElroy /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, W. K., Ward, H., Kablinger, A., &amp; Murphy, T. (1997). Fluvoxamine in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Related Conditions. J Clin Psychiatry, 58(suppl 5), 32-49.&lt;/ref&gt;  GABAergic [[mood stabilizer]]s and anticonvulsive drugs such as [[gabapentin]], [[lithium]], [[carbamazepine]], and [[divalproex]] seem to aid in controlling the incidence of outbursts.&lt;ref name=McElroy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Boyd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bozikas, V., Bascilla, F., Yulis, P., &amp; Savvidou, I. (2001). Gabapentin for Behavioral [[Episodic dyscontrol syndrome|Dyscontrol]] with Mental Retardation. ''Am J Psychiatry'', 158(6), 965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coccaro EF, et al. "A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Fluoxetine in Patients With Intermittent Explosive Disorder," ''Journal of Clinical Psychiatry'' (April 21, 2009): Vol. 70, No. 5, pp. 653–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiolytics help alleviate tension and may help reduce explosive outbursts by increasing the provocative stimulus tolerance threshold, and are especially indicated in patients with comorbid obsessive-compulsive or other anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt; However, certain anxiolytics are known to ''increase'' anger and irritability in some individuals, especially benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brown.uk.com/anxiety/paton.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717162824/http://www.brown.uk.com/anxiety/paton.pdf |archivedate=2016-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Impulsive behavior, and especially impulsive violence predisposition has been correlated to a low brain [[serotonin]] turnover rate, indicated by a low concentration of [[5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid|5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] (5-HIAA) in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF).  This [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] appears to act on the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] in the [[hypothalamus]], which is the target for serotonergic output from the dorsal and median [[raphe nuclei]] playing a role in maintaining the [[circadian rhythm]] and regulation of [[blood sugar]].  A tendency towards low 5-HIAA may be [[Heredity|hereditary]].  A putative hereditary component to low CSF 5-HIAA and concordantly possibly to impulsive violence has been proposed.  Other traits that [[Correlation|correlate]] with IED are low vagal tone and increased [[insulin]] secretion.  A suggested explanation for IED is a [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] of the [[gene]] for [[tryptophan hydroxylase]], which produces a serotonin [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]]; this [[genotype]] is found more commonly in individuals with impulsive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Virkkunen M, Goldman D, Nielsen DA, Linnoila M |title=Low brain serotonin turnover rate (low CSF 5-HIAA) and impulsive violence |journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=271–5 |date=July 1995 |pmid=7544158 |pmc=1188701 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
IED may also be associated with [[lesions]] in the [[prefrontal cortex]], with damage to these areas, including the [[amygdala]], increasing the incidence of impulsive and aggressive behavior and the inability to predict the outcomes of an individual's own actions.  Lesions in these areas are also associated with improper blood sugar control, leading to decreased brain function in these areas, which are associated with planning and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Best M, Williams JM, Coccaro EF |title=Evidence for a dysfunctional prefrontal circuit in patients with an impulsive aggressive disorder |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=99 |issue=12 |pages=8448–53 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12034876 |pmc=123087 |doi=10.1073/pnas.112604099 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A national sample in the [[United States]] estimated that 16 million Americans may fit the criteria for IED.&lt;ref name = Kessler2006/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Two epidemiological studies of community samples approximated the lifetime prevalence of IED to be 4–6%, depending on the criteria set used.&lt;ref name="Kessler2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kessler RC, Coccaro EF, Fava M, Jaeger S, Jin R, Walters E |title=The prevalence and correlates of DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication |journal=Arch.

Lifetime and one-month prevalence rates of intermittent explosive disorder in a community sample. J Clin Psychiatry 65:820–824, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A Ukrainian study found comparable rates of lifetime IED (4.2%), suggesting that a lifetime prevalence of IED of 4–6% is not limited to American samples.&lt;ref&gt;Bromet EJ, Gluzman SF, Paniotto VI et al. Epidemiology of psychiatric and alcohol disorders in Ukraine: Findings from the Ukraine World Mental Health survey. Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol 40:681–690, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; One-month and one-year point prevalences of IED in these studies were reported as 2.0%&lt;ref name="Coccaro2004" /&gt; and 2.7%,&lt;ref name="Kessler2006"/&gt; respectively. Extrapolating to the national level, 16.2 million Americans would have IED during their lifetimes and as many as 10.5 million in any year and 6 million in any month.

Among a ''clinical'' population, a 2005 study found the lifetime prevalence of IED to be 6.3%.&lt;ref name="Coccaro2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coccaro EF, Posternak MA, Zimmerman M |title=Prevalence and features of intermittent explosive disorder in a clinical setting |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=10 |pages=1221–7 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16259534 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v66n1003 |url=http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&amp;ID=10001473 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120701120642/http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&amp;ID=10001473 |archivedate=2012-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevalence appears to be higher in men than in women.&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;{{cite book |author=Boyd, Mary Ann |title=Psychiatric nursing: contemporary practice |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=L7zqhrxLp3MC&amp;pg=PA820 820–1] |isbn=0-7817-9169-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of US subjects with IED, 67.8% had engaged in direct interpersonal aggression, 20.9% in threatened interpersonal aggression, and 11.4% in aggression against objects. Subjects reported engaging in 27.8 high-severity aggressive acts during their worst year, with 2–3 outbursts requiring medical attention. Across the lifespan, the mean value of property damage due to aggressive outbursts was $1603.&lt;ref name="Kessler2006" /&gt;

A study in the March 2016 ''Journal of Clinical Psychiatry'' suggests a relationship between infection with the parasite ''Toxoplasma gondii'' and psychiatric aggression such as IED.&lt;ref&gt;Coccaro EF, Lee R, Groer MW, Can A, Coussons-Read M, Postolache TT (March 2016). [http://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/article/Pages/2016/v77n03/v77n0313.aspx "''Toxoplasma gondii'' Infection: Relationship With Aggression in Psychiatric Subjects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324120448/http://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/2016/v77n03/v77n0313.aspx |date=2016-03-24 }}. ''[[J Clin Psychiatry]]'' '''77'''(3): 334–341.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the first edition of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-I), a disorder of impulsive aggression was referred to as a '''passive-aggressive personality type (aggressive type)'''. This construct was characterized by a "persistent reaction to frustration are "generally excitable, aggressive, and over-responsive to environmental pressures" with "gross outbursts of rage or of verbal or physical aggressiveness different from their usual behavior".

In the third edition (DSM-III), this was for the first time codified as '''intermittent explosive disorder''' and assigned clinical disorder status under Axis I. However, some researchers saw the criteria as poorly operationalized.&lt;ref&gt;Felthous et al., 1991&lt;/ref&gt; About 80% of individuals who would now be diagnosed with the disorder would have been excluded.

In the DSM-IV, the criteria were improved but still lacked objective criteria for the intensity, frequency, and nature of aggressive acts to meet criteria for IED.&lt;ref name="Aboujaoude" /&gt; This led some researchers to adopt an alternate criteria set with which to conduct research, known as the IED-IR (Integrated Research).  The severity and frequency of aggressive behavior required for the diagnosis was clearly operationalized, the aggressive acts were required to be impulsive in nature, subjective distress was required to precede the explosive outbursts, and the criteria allowed for comorbid diagnoses with [[borderline personality disorder]] and [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Coccaro et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt; These research criteria became the basis for the DSM-5 diagnosis.

In the current version of the DSM (DSM-5), the disorder appears under the "Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders" category. In the DSM-IV, physical aggression was required to meet criteria for the disorder, but these criteria were modified in the DSM-5 to include verbal aggression and nondestructive/noninjurious physical aggression. The listing was also updated to specify frequency criteria. Further, aggressive outbursts are now required to be impulsive in nature, and must cause marked distress, impairment, or negative consequences for the individual. Individuals must be at least six years old to receive the diagnosis. The text also clarified the disorder's relationship to other disorders such as [[ADHD]] and [[disruptive mood dysregulation disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5 by American Psychiatric Publishing.

The year 1981 was proclaimed the '''International Year of Disabled Persons''' (IYDP) by the [[United Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Proclamation 4818 |date=6 February 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It called for a plan of action with an emphasis on [[equal opportunity|equalization of opportunities]], rehabilitation and prevention of disabilities. The slogan of IYDP was "a wheelchair in every home", defined as the right of persons with [[disability|disabilities]] to take part fully in the life and development of their societies, enjoy [[quality of life|living conditions]] equal to those of other citizens, and have an equal share in improved conditions resulting from socio-economic development. 

A major outcome of the International Year of Disabled Persons was the formulation of the [[World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons]] adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1982. This also is recognized by the Preamble (f) of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. 

The International Decade of Disabled Persons ran from 1983 to 1993. It was closed by a speech in the General Assembly by Dr. Robert R. Davila, then an Assistant Secretary in the U.S. Department of Education who declared that "before the year is up, we expect the number of disabled persons to double".

December 3 each year, since 1992, is identified by the United Nations as the [[United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities|International Day of Persons with Disabilities]].

British new wave singer-songwriter [[Ian Dury]], himself a disabled person, released a song titled "[[Spasticus Autisticus]]" in 1981, which he intended as a scathing critique of the International Year, which he viewed as "patronising" and  "crashingly insensitive".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/hit-me-leicester-square-theatre-london-1366304.html The Independent - Hit Me!, Leicester Square Theatre, London]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George McKay (2009) '[http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2372/1/displayFulltext.pdf "Crippled with nerves": popular music and polio, with particular reference to Ian Dury'.] ''Popular Music'' 28:3, 341–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

Qadisiyah was formed by the damming of the Euphrates River above Haditha, Iraq. It has 100 kilometres of [[shoreline]] and provides irrigation water for nearby cultivated fields.

On December 3, 2006, it was the site of an emergency landing by an American forces [[CH-46E Sea Knight]] helicopter from the [[3rd Marine Aircraft Wing]] that resulted in the drowning deaths of four out of its sixteen passengers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popasmoke.com/kia/incidents.php?incident_id=318&amp;conflict_id=&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Milngavie]] water treatment works''' commonly known as '''The Waterworks''' is a [[Scottish Water]]-operated [[water treatment]] facility located in [[Milngavie]], Scotland. It is primary source of the water for the city of [[Glasgow]] (and the [[Greater Glasgow]] area) in western [[Scotland]]. Part of the Victorian [[Loch Katrine]] water project, construction was started in 1855 and the works was opened by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1859, replacing the previous water supply sourced from the [[River Clyde]] at [[Cuningar Loop]] in [[Dalmarnock]].

Its completion led to the virtual eradication of [[typhoid]] and [[cholera]], diseases which were widespread at the time, from the city. The success of the project was marked by the erection of the Stewart Memorial Fountain in [[Kelvingrove Park]]. The works were described by James M. Gale as worthy to "bear comparison with the most extensive aqueducts in the world, not excluding those of ancient Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Transactions of the Institution of Engineers in Scotland, 1863&amp;ndash;4, vii. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The first aqueduct project was built under the guidance of [[John Frederick Bateman]] (an example of his engineering prowess that can still be seen working today). A second aqueduct was completed in 1901.

The works are currently operated by [[Scottish Water]] and at average demand, it can supply enough [[potable water]] to those it serves for up to 7 days. Its primary supply is via two [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s from [[Loch Katrine]] in the north, that are 56km (32 miles) in length, and can deliver up to {{convert|50,000,000|impgal}} a day. Milngavie itself is situated at almost 120m (400ft) above sea level &amp;ndash; sufficient to provide adequate water pressure to the majority of Glasgow without the need for pumping. The Milngavie reservoirs distribute water to secondary reservoirs, such as Cockmuir Reservoir in [[Springburn]] Park, and various [[Water tower]]s throughout the city.

The reservoirs are a common attraction for walkers, cyclists and photographers, who take advantage of the peripheral walkways that verge on [[Mugdock Country Park]], and offer views over the Glasgow area.

== Reservoirs ==
[[Milngavie]] water treatment works has three reservoirs, Craigmaddie Reservoir to the East and Mugdock Reservoir to the West. Bankell Reservoir is situated to the North of Craigmaddie Reservoir. During the assembly of the new water treatment facilities, both the Mugdock and Craigmaddie reservoirs were drained in 2005 and 2006 respectively to facilitate the laying of pipes to and from the plant, and the resultant scene from Craigmaddie reservoir can be seen above. Special consideration had to be taken for the draining of the reservoirs, as they had never been drained in 150 years of operation.

=== Mugdock Reservoir ===
Mugdock reservoir was initially built and opened in the 1850s.

=== Craigmaddie Reservoir ===
The Craigmaddie service reservoir was built and opened in 1896 to cater for increased demand.

=== Bankell Reservoir ===
The new, third, reservoir is named Bankell Reservoir, and went into operation on 26 May 2006. Holding {{convert|20000000|impgal}}, the Bankell Reservoir is 80% underground to minimise ecological impact. It is one of the largest treated water holding tanks in the world.

The new reservoir and treatment works were developed in the wake of the discovery of the waterborne [[cryptosporidium]] parasite in Mugdock Reservoir on 4 August 2002, as a result of the [[2002 Glasgow floods]]. Cryptosporidium can cause severe diarrhoea. About 140,000 people in Glasgow were affected &amp;ndash; they were told not to drink [[tap water]] without boiling it first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cryptosporidium strikes again | date=2002-08-04 | publisher=BBC News Online | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2171593.stm | accessdate = 2007-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security Controversy==
[[File:SecurityMWW.jpg|thumb|right|Security precautions at Mugdock Reservoir (2016)]]
In the early 2000s, security at the facility was tightened with large metal screens being erected around areas of both Mugdock and Craigmaddie Reservoirs, believed to be an action taken in line with the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]'s security policy after the [[September 11 Attacks]]. The fences and security cameras remained in place for many years, which led to public annoyance at the unnecessary and impractical screens. Councillor Duncan Cumming, who chaired the conservation group representing the community during construction of the new treatment plant, said: "The erection of the ugly, high, metal fencing around parts of the reservoir was a knee-jerk reaction by the Ministry of Defence to the 9/11 terrorist attacked in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calls made for Milngavie's 9/11 anti-terror railings to be taken down|url=http://www.milngavieherald.co.uk/news/local-headlines/calls-made-for-milngavie-s-9-11-anti-terror-railings-to-be-taken-down-1-214874|website=Milngavie &amp; Bearsden Herald|publisher=Johnston Press|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Member of Parliament [[Jo Swinson]] raised awareness of issue in the [[House of Commons]], saying: "but these so-called security fences around Milngavie reservoir cover only a tiny part of the three-mile perimeter, and as the rest is completely open to the public they serve no practical purpose other than being an eyesore spoiling a beautiful and popular local attraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milngavie Waterworks|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2010-06-28/debates/1006288000017/MilngavieWaterworks|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the majority of the existing security fences were removed from the facility, and the large sections of land previously fenced off are now accessible to the public.

== Statistics ==
* Officially opened: 14 October 1859
* Capacity: {{convert|548000000|impgal}}
Bankell is a service reservoir holding potable water i.e. treated and chlorinated which is fit for human consumption. Mugdock and Craigmaddie are reservoirs holding raw untreated water.

'''Naswār''' ({{lang-ps|نسوار}}; [[Cyrillic script]]: насва́р), also called '''nās''' (ناس; на́с) or '''nasvay''' (نسوای; насвай), is a moist, powdered tobacco [[snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] consumed mostly in [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. Naswar is stuffed in the floor of the mouth under the lower lip, or inside the cheek, for extended periods of time. It is similar to [[dipping tobacco]] and [[snus]].

[[File:Насвай.jpg|thumb|Naswar]]

==History==
Naswar was introduced into [[Western Europe]] by a [[Spain|Spanish]] monk named Ramon Pane after [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus']] second [[voyages of Christopher Columbus|voyage]] to the [[Americas]] during 1493-1496.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, G. E.: Columbus, Ramon Pane, and the Beginnings of American Anthropology (1906), Kessinger Publishing, 2003, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1561, [[Jean Nicot]], the [[France|French]] ambassador in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], sent naswar to [[Catherine de' Medici]] to treat her son's persistent migraines.&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, T.: Food of the Gods - The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge - A Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution, Bantam Books, 1993, page 199&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in South and Central Asia==
The green powder form is used most frequently. It is made by pouring water into a cement-lined cavity, to which slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and air-cured, sun-dried, powdered tobacco is added. Indigo is added to the mixture to impart color,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Zqo67BjH7UC&amp;pg=PA19|title=Control of Tobacco-related Cancers and Other Diseases: Proceedings of an International Symposium, January 15-19, 1990, TIFR, Bombay|last=Gupta|first=Prakash C.|last2=Hamner|first2=James E.|last3=Murti|first3=P. R.|date=1992|publisher=Prakash C. Gupta|isbn=9780195629613|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[juniper]] ash may be added as flavoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Achakzai|first=Khanoranga|last2=Firdous|first2=Shahana|last3=Bibi|first3=Aasma|last4=Khalid|first4=Sofia|date=January 2016|title=Juniper (Juniperus excelsa M.

Sci.|volume=16|pages=320-325|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Currently, the countries of the region freely sell naswar in the markets, usually on trays with cigarettes and [[sunflower seeds]]. The only exception is [[Turkmenistan]], where in 2008 President [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]] signed a decree banning the production, sale, use, and import of naswar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrasia.ru/newsA.php?st=1212054180|title=В Туркмении запретили производить, продавать и жевать насвай - ЦентрАзия|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 naswar was included in the list of [[narcotic]] and [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] substances to be controlled in [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kazakh-zerno.kz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38128&amp;itemid=80|title=ИА КазахЗерно|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Russia and Eastern Europe==
On the territory of [[Russia]], naswar is not a traditional product, but it gained popularity especially among teenagers. It was sold in the markets of [[Moscow]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flb.ru/info/33195.html|title=Унесённые пленом : Попавшие в плен военнослужащие считаются пропавшими без вести - FLB.ru - Агентство Федеральных Расследований|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other cities of the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]], [[Volga Federal District|Volga]], and other regions of the country. Its trade was usually conducted on trays with spices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the association of tobacco distributors "Grandtabak", in the first half of 2004, Russia's import of naswar or "chewing tobacco" amounted to almost 67 tons (total value of 16,500 US dollars), primarily from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandtabak.ru/rus/businesshotnews/2004/aug.html|title=Насвай - Словарь терминов - glossary - Гранд Табак|author=Гранд Табак|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 2013, the Russian [[State Duma]] signed a federal law (''N 15-ФЗ'') which banned both wholesale and retail naswar from 1 June 2013 onward in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/%28Spravka%29?OpenAgent&amp;RN=163560-6&amp;02|title=Автоматизированная система обеспечения законодательной деятельности|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports on physicians instructing their patients to use naswar in [[Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://medvestnik.iatp.by/docs/mv_27/vs_raz.html Medvestnik] / Газета «Медицинский вестник»&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Estonia]], naswar is being distributed to [[nightclub|discothèques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moles.ee/99/Sep/10/4-2.html|title=Газета "Молодежь Эстонии" 10.09.99 Кухня наркоманов становится богаче Инесса КОЛЛОМ.|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
There are two forms of naswar; powder, and a paste cake style mixed with lime. It has a very pungent and powerful smell, resembling that of a fresh bale of coastal hay,{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} and has a subtle flavor as it mixes with the saliva. The nicotine effect can occur within 5 minutes after intake, producing a slight burning sensation on the inner lip and tongue.

==Manufacture==
Sun and heat-dried tobacco leaves, slaked lime, ash from tree bark, and flavoring and coloring agents are mixed together. Water is added and the mixture is rolled into balls.

Bethesda, Maryland: US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; water, and sometimes gum.

Naswar: tobacco, slaked lime, indigo, cardamom, oil, menthol, water.

==Controversy==
In November 2006 an editorial in the newspaper ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]'' in Pakistan caused some controversy over its allegedly biased representations of [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] predilection for naswar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EDITORIAL: Hasba Bill beats the WP Bill hands down! |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C11%5C15%5Cstory_15-11-2006_pg3_1 |accessdate=16 October 2018 |work=Daily Times |date=15 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227170402/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C11%5C15%5Cstory_15-11-2006_pg3_1 |archivedate=27 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
The major side effect of using naswar is addiction, and it becomes difficult to get rid of it. It is also increasingly known that naswar often causes oral and throat cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.oraloncology.2013.04.004|pmid=23683469|title=P53 (Pro72Arg) polymorphism associated with the risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma in gutka, niswar and manpuri addicted patients of Pakistan|journal=Oral Oncology|volume=49|issue=8|pages=818|year=2013|last1=Saleem|first1=Saima|last2=Azhar|first2=Abid|last3=Hameed|first3=Abdul|last4=Khan|first4=Mansoor Ahmed|last5=Abbasi|first5=Zubair Ahmed|last6=Qureshi|first6=Navid Rashid|last7=Ajmal|first7=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6430">A '''nursing care plan''' provides direction on the type of [[nursing care]] the individual/family/community may need.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The main focus of a nursing care plan is to facilitate standardised, evidence-based and holistic care.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nursing care plans have been used for quite a number of years for human purposes and are now also getting used in the veterinary profession.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A care plan includes the following components: assessment, diagnosis, expected outcomes, interventions, rationale and evaluation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballantyne|first=Helen|date=2016|title=Developing nursing care plans|journal=Nursing Standard|volume=30|issue=26|pages=51–60|doi=10.7748/ns.30.26.51.s48|pmid=26907149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UK nurse Helen Ballantyne, care plans are a critical aspect of [[nursing]] and they are meant to allow standardised, evidence-based holistic care.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is important to draw attention to the difference between ''care plan'' and ''care planning''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Care planning is related to identifying problems and coming up with solutions to reduce or remove the problems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The care plan is essentially the documentation of this process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It includes within it a set of actions the [[nurse]] will apply to resolve/support [[nursing diagnoses]] identified by [[nursing assessment]]. Care plans make it possible for interventions to be recorded and their effectiveness assessed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nursing care plans provide continuity of care, safety, quality care and compliance. A nursing care plan promotes documentation and is used for reimbursement purposes such as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]].

== Objective ==
# To promote evidence-based nursing care and to provide comfortable and familiar conditions in hospitals or health centers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hooks|first=Robin|date=2016|title=Developing nursing care plans|journal=Nursing Standard|volume=30|issue=45|pages=64–65|doi=10.7748/ns.30.45.64.s48|pmid=27380704}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# To promote holistic care which means the whole person is considered including physical, psychological, social and spiritual in relation to management and prevention of the disease.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# To support methods such as [[care pathway]]s and care bundles. Care pathways involve a team effort in order to come to a consensus with regards to [[Standard of care|standards of care]] and expected outcomes while care bundles are related to best practice with regards to care given for a specific disease.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# To record care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# To measure care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
The function of nursing care plans has changed drastically over the past several decades. In 1953, care planning was not believed to be within the nursing scope of practice.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballantyne|first=Helen|date=2016|title=Developing nursing care plans|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.gvsu.edu/docview/1785225901/fulltext/D0CC8D29756A4190PQ/2?accountid=39473|journal=Nursing Standard|volume=30 |issue=26|pages=51–57|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, care planning was activity based.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Patients were listed according to the procedures they were having done, which determined their plan of care.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Care provided was passed on by word of mouth, dressing books, and work lists.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These forms of communication all focus on activities the nurse performed instead of focusing on the patient.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Today, nursing care plans focus on the individuals unique set of needs and goals.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Care plans are individualized to create a patient-centered approach to care.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nursing Care Plans : Guidelines for Individualizing Client Care Across the Life Span|last=Doenges|first=Marilynn|publisher=F. A. Davis Company|year=2014|isbn=9780803640900|location=Philadelphia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, nurses must perform a physical assessment prior to planning a patients care.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Components of a care plan ==
A care plan includes the following components; 
# Client assessment, medical results and diagnostic reports. This is the first step in order to be able to create a care plan. In particular client assessment is related to the following areas and abilities: physical, emotional, sexual, psychosocial, cultural, spiritual/transpersonal, cognitive, functional, age related, economic and environmental. Information is this area can be subjective and objective.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Nursing care plans: guidelines for individualizing client care across the life span |last=Doenges |first=Marilynn |last2=Moorehouse |first2=Mary |last3=Murr |first3=Alice |location=Philadelphia |publisher=F.A. Davis Company |year=2014 |edition=9th |isbn=9780803640900 |oclc=874809931}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Expected patient outcomes are outlined. These may be long and short term.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
# Nursing interventions are documented in the care plan.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
# Rationale for interventions in order to be evidence based care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
# Evaluation. This documents the outcome of nursing interventions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Computerised nursing care plans==
A computerised nursing care plan is a digital way of writing the care plan, compared to handwritten. Computerised nursing care plans are an essential element of the nursing process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Computerised nursing care plans have increased documentation of signs and symptoms, associated factors and nursing interventions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Using electronic devices when creating nursing care plans are a more accurate, accessible, easier completed and easier edited, in comparison with handwritten and preprinted care plans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thoroddsen |first1=Asta |last2=Ehnfors |first2=Margareta |last3=Ehrenberg |first3=Anna |date=October 2011 |title=Content and completeness of care plans after implementation of standardized nursing terminologies and computerized records |journal=Computers, Informatics, Nursing: CIN |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=599–607 |doi=10.1097/NCN.0b013e3182148c31 |pmid=22041791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Over-the-counter''' ('''OTC''') '''drugs''' are [[medication|medicine]]s sold directly to a consumer without a [[medical prescription|prescription]] from a healthcare professional,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as opposed to [[prescription drugs]], which may be sold only to consumers possessing a valid prescription.
In many countries, OTC drugs are selected by a [[regulatory agency]] to ensure that they are ingredients that are safe and effective when used without a [[physician]]'s care. OTC drugs are usually regulated by [[active pharmaceutical ingredients]] (APIs), not final products.  By regulating APIs instead of specific drug formulations, governments allow manufacturers freedom to formulate ingredients, or combinations of ingredients, into proprietary mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/EmergencyPreparedness/BioterrorismandDrugPreparedness/ucm133301.htm Over-the-Counter Medicines: What's Right for You?]. Fda.gov (2009-04-30). Retrieved on 2012-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''over-the-counter'' may be somewhat [[counterintuitive]], since, in many countries, these [[drugs]] are often placed on shelves in self-service areas of stores, like any other packaged products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, [[prescription drug]]s are almost always passed over a counter from the pharmacist to the customer. Some drugs may be legally classified as over-the-counter (i.e. no prescription is required), but may only be dispensed by a pharmacist after an assessment of the patient's needs or the provision of [[patient education]]. In many countries, a number of OTC drugs are available in establishments without a [[pharmacy]], such as general stores, supermarkets, and gas stations. Regulations detailing the establishments where drugs may be sold, who is authorized to dispense them, and whether a prescription is required vary considerably from country to country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wdrugs.com OTC drugs comparison]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
As of 2011, around a third of older adults in the U.S. reportedly used OTC drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qato DM|last2=Wilder J|last3=Schumm L|last4=Gillet V|last5=Alexander G|date=2016-04-01|title=CHanges in prescription and over-the-counter medication and dietary supplement use among older adults in the united states, 2005 vs 2011|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.8581|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=4|pages=473–482|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.8581|pmid=26998708|issn=2168-6106|pmc=5024734}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, the prevalence of use by adults in the U.S. as first-line treatment for minor illnesses had reached 81%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Regulation by country==

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], there are four drug schedules:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Drug Schedules - Overview|url=http://napra.ca/pages/Schedules/Overview.aspx?id=1925|website=National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Schedule 1: Requires a prescription for sale and are provided to the public by a licensed pharmacist.
* Schedule 2: Does not require a prescription but requires an assessment by a pharmacist prior to sale. These drugs are kept in an area of the pharmacy where there is no public access and may also be referred to as "behind-the-counter" drugs.
* Schedule 3: Does not require a prescription but must be kept in an area under the supervision of a pharmacist. These drugs are kept in an area of the retail outlet where self-selection is possible, but a pharmacist must be available to assist in the self-selection of medication if required.
* Unscheduled: Does not require a prescription and may be sold in any retail outlet.

All medications other than Schedule 1 may be considered an OTC drug, as they do not require prescriptions for sale. While the [[National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities]] provides recommendations on the scheduling of drugs for sale in Canada, each province may determine its own scheduling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Drug Scheduling Advisory Committee|url=http://napra.ca/pages/Schedules/Committee.aspx|website=National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drugs found in each schedule may vary from province to province.

=== India ===
In November 2016, India's Drug Consultative Committee announced it was embarking on establishing a definition of drugs which could be dispensed without a prescription.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millar|first=Abi|date=February 2018|title=Defining OTC Drugs|url=http://www.nridigital.com/pharma-technology-magazine/february-2018.html|journal=Pharma Technology Focus|publisher=Net Resources International|volume=|issue=67|pages=|access-date=3 February 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the general assumption was that any drug which did not fall into a prescription schedule could be purchased without a prescription.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, the needed definition had not been enacted by early 2018. The lack of a legal definition for OTC drugs has led to this {{US$|4 billion}} market segment being effectively unregulated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]], there are four categories:&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0021505/geldigheidsdatum_01-11-2013 Geneesmiddelenwet]&lt;/ref&gt;

* UR (Uitsluitend Recept): prescription only
* UA (Uitsluitend Apotheek): pharmacist only
* UAD (Uitsluitend Apotheek of Drogist): pharmacist or drugstore only
* AV (Algemene Verkoop): can be sold in general stores

A drug that is UA can be sold OTC but only by pharmacists. The drug can be on the shelves like any other product. Examples are [[domperidone]], 400&amp;nbsp;mg [[ibuprofen]] up to 50 tablets and [[dextromethorphan]]. A drug that is UAD can also be sold at drugstores, stores where no prescription can be filed and there is only a relatively small selection of popular drugs like painkillers and cough medicine. The drugs are usually on the shelves, and the store also sells items like toys, gadgets, perfumes and homeopathic products. The drugs in this category have limited risk and addiction potential. Examples are [[naproxen]] and [[diclofenac]] in small amounts, [[cinnarizine]], 400&amp;nbsp;mg ibuprofen up to 20 tablets and also 500&amp;nbsp;mg [[paracetamol]] up to 50 tablets. Drugs in the AV category can be sold at [[supermarkets]], gas stations etc. and include only drugs with minimal risk to the public, like paracetamol up to 20 tablets, 200&amp;nbsp;mg ibuprofen up to 10 tablets, [[cetirizine]] and [[loperamide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbg-meb.nl/CBG/nl/humane-geneesmiddelen/geneesmiddeleninformatiebank/default.htm CBG-MEB Drug database]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the manufacture and sale of OTC substances is regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. The FDA requires that all "new drugs" obtain a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) before entering interstate commerce, but the act exempts any drugs [[generally recognized as safe and effective]] (GRAS/E). To deal with the vast number of OTC drugs that were already on the market before the requirement that all drugs obtain an NDA, the FDA created the OTC monograph system to review classes of drugs and to categorize them as GRAS/E after review by expert panels. Certain classes of OTC drugs would not be required to obtain an NDA and could remain on the market if they conformed to the monograph guidelines for doses, labeling, and warnings finalized in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]].

Thus, an OTC drug product is allowed to be marketed either (1) pursuant to an [[Monograph#United States Food and Drug Administration regulation|FDA monograph]] or (2) pursuant to an NDA for products that do not fit within a specific monograph. There is also the possibility that certain OTC drug products are marketed under the grandfathering provisions of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], but the FDA has never formally acknowledged that any legitimate grandfathered OTC drug exists.

Examples of OTC substances approved in the United States are sunscreens, anti-microbial and anti-fungal products, external and internal analgesics such as [[lidocaine]] and [[aspirin]], [[psoriasis]] and [[eczema]] topical treatments, anti-[[dandruff]] shampoos containing [[coal tar]], and other topical products with a therapeutic effect.

The [[Federal Trade Commission]] regulates advertising of OTC products, in contrast to prescription drug advertising, which is regulated by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/UCM148055.pdf Regulation of Nonprescription Drug Products] Fda.gov. Retrieved on 2014-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA requires OTC products to be  labeled with an approved "Drug Facts" label to educate consumers about their medications. The labels comply to a standard format and are intended to be easy for typical consumers to understand. Drug Facts labels include information on the product's [[active ingredient|active ingredient(s)]], [[Indication (medicine)|indication]]s and purpose, safety warnings, directions for use, and [[inactive ingredients]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/EmergencyPreparedness/BioterrorismandDrugPreparedness/ucm133411.htm The New Over-the-Counter Medicine Label: Take a Look]. Fda.gov (2012-04-27). Retrieved on 2012-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restricted over-the-counter substances====
An ill-defined third category of substances is products having over-the-counter status from the FDA while being simultaneously subject to other restrictions on sale. While they are legally classified as OTC drugs, they are typically stored behind the counter and are sold only in stores that are registered with their state. They may be unavailable in convenience and grocery stores that stock other non-restricted OTC medications.

For example, many drugstores have moved products containing [[pseudoephedrine]], an OTC product, into locations where customers must ask a pharmacist for them. A prescription is not required; the change has been made in an effort to reduce [[methamphetamine]] production. Since the passage of the [[Illinois Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act]] and the subsequent federal [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]], the purchase of pseudoephedrine is restricted. Sellers of pseudoephedrine must obtain and record the identity of the purchaser and enforce [[Pseudoephedrine#United States|quantity restrictions]]. Some states may have more stringent requirements (such as [[controlled substances in Oregon#Methamphetamine|Oregon]], where a [[medical prescription]] is required to purchase any quantity of pseudoephedrine). After initial attempts to control methamphetamine use (by requiring documentation of sale with government issued ID as well as limits on the quantity an individual could purchase) failed to realize meaningful reductions in methamphetamine use and production, [[Mississippi]] passed House Bill 512 in the State Senate on February 2, 2010 "to require a prescription from a licensed medical professional to purchase over-the-counter medicines with pseudoephedrine, [[ephedrine]], or any other precursor chemical that can readily and illicitly be converted into [[methamphetamine]], [[Methcathinone]] or any active/scheduled analogs of [[Phenylethylamines]]/ [[amphetamine]]."{{Citation needed|date = February 2016|reason = can't verify this wording}} However, products containing the substance are still OTC in most states, since no prescription is required.

A similar regulation applies to some forms of [[emergency contraception]]. The FDA considers them to be OTC substances for females 17 or over but prescription drugs for younger women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/UCM109775 FDA Approves Plan B One-Step Emergency Contraceptive; Lowers Age for Obtaining Two-Dose Plan B Emergency Contraceptive without a Prescription]. Fda.gov. Retrieved on 2012-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt; To enforce the restriction and to provide counseling and education on proper use, an agreement between the manufacturer and the FDA requires the drugs are stored behind the pharmacy counter. Women may obtain the medication without a prescription after providing proof of age to pharmacy staff and receiving any necessary patient education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/WomensHealthResearch/ucm134289.htm FDA Approves Over-the-Counter Access for Plan B for Women 18 and Older]. Fda.gov (2009-04-30). Retrieved on 2012-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some [[List of Schedule V drugs|Schedule V]] controlled substances may be classified as OTC products in certain states. Such drugs are sold without a prescription but are subject to record-keeping rules and quantity and/or age restrictions, and they must be dispensed by a [[pharmacy]].

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, medication is governed by the Medicines Regulations 2012. Medication falls into one of three categories:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicines information|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Medicinesinfo/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=19 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Prescription Only Medication (POM), which are legally available only with a valid prescription from a prescriber. A [[pharmacist]] has to be on the premises for POM medicines to be dispensed, required by law. The medicine has been specifically prescribed for the patient holding the prescription, so it is considered safe for only the recipient to take. Just a small example of these include most [[antibiotics]] and all [[antidepressants]] or [[antidiabetic]] medications. Drugs included as POM are high-strength painkillers such as [[oxycodone]] and [[tramadol]], medications such as [[sildenafil]] (Viagra) and [[diazepam]] (Valium), and certain topical preparations such as [[corticosteroids]]. These medicines are often sold by drug dealers, especially those marked as "CD POM," which are controlled due to abuse risk such as [[dipipanone]], [[temazepam]], and [[methadone]].
# General Sales List (GSL), available off the shelf with no pharmacy training required to sell (so they can be sold anywhere, such as supermarkets). In general, they are considered safe for most people when taken correctly. Examples of these include 16-packs (or less) of painkillers such as [[paracetamol]] and [[ibuprofen]] as well as a host of other safe medications such as small pack sizes of [[Antihistamine|antiallergy]] tablets, [[laxative]] medication, and skin creams.
# Pharmacy Medicines (P) are medicines which are legally neither a POM or GSL medication. These can be sold from a registered pharmacy but should not be available for self-selection (although directions to discuss a 'P' product may be allocated shelf space with associated GSL items). 'P' medications are reserved from the GSL list as they are either associated with a need for advice on use, or used in conditions which may require referral to a medical prescriber. Suitable trained counter assistants may sell a 'P' medication under the supervision of a pharmacist and will ask questions to determine if the customer needs to be referred for a discussion with a pharmacist. Some 'POM' medicines are available for use in certain situations and doses as 'P' medicines.

If it is not appropriate to sell a 'P' medication – i.e. the condition is not suitable for self-management and requires referral to a medical prescriber – then a sale should not occur and the pharmacist has a legal and professional obligation to refer this on to an appropriate service.

Examples of these include some sleep aid tablets such as [[Diphenhydramine|Nytol]], human [[deworming]] tablets such as [[Mebendazole]], painkillers with small amounts of [[codeine]] (up to 12.8&amp;nbsp;mg per tablet), and [[pseudoephedrine]]. Medication available only with a prescription is marked somewhere on the box/container with [POM]. Pharmacy-only products are marked with [P]. A prescription is not required for [P] medicines, and pharmacy sales assistants are required by [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] codes to ask certain questions, which varies for what the customer says. If they ask for a specific product, the pharmacy assistant must ask "Who is it for," "How long have you had the symptoms," "Are you allergic to any medication," "Are you taking any medication" ('WHAM' questions). If a customer asks for a remedy, e.g., hay fever, then the two WHAM questions must be followed "Who is it for," "What are the symptoms," "How long have you had the symptoms," "Have you taken any action towards your symptoms," and "Are you taking any other medication." It is with this information that the pharmacist can halt the sale, if need be. No [POM], [P] or [GSL] products that are stocked in a pharmacy can be sold, dispensed, or pre-made until a responsible pharmacist is signed in and on the premises. Some medication available in supermarkets and petrol stations is sold only in smaller packet sizes. Often, larger packs will be marked as [P] and available only from a pharmacy. Frequently, customers buying larger-than-usual doses of [P] medicines (such as [[DXM]], promethazine, codeine or Gee's linctus) will be queried, due to the possibility of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Availabilityprescribingsellingandsupplyingofmedicines/Availabilityofmedicines/index.htm Availability of medicines]. MHRA. Retrieved on 2012-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switches between prescription and OTC==
As a general rule, over-the-counter drugs have to be used primarily to treat a condition that does not require the direct supervision of a doctor and must be proven to be reasonably safe and well tolerated. OTC drugs are usually also required to have little or no abuse potential, although in some areas drugs such as [[codeine]] are available OTC (usually in strictly limited formulations or requiring paperwork or identification to be submitted during purchase).

Over time, often 3–6 years, drugs that prove themselves safe and appropriate as prescription medicines may be switched from prescription to OTC. An example of this is [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl), an anti-histamine which once required a prescription but now is available OTC nearly everywhere. More recent examples are [[cimetidine]] and [[loratadine]] in the United States, and [[ibuprofen]] in Australia.

It is somewhat unusual for an OTC drug to be withdrawn from the market as a result of safety concerns, rather than market forces, though it does happen occasionally. For example, [[phenylpropanolamine]] was removed from sale in the United States over concern regarding [[strokes]] in young women. A study has been done examining consumer's perceptions about the risk of and access to nonprescription medication. A substantial minority of the public appears willing to accept considerable risk to gain greater access to pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name=alexander&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=GC|author2=Mohajir N |author3=Meltzer DO |title=Consumers' perceptions about risk of and access to nonprescription medications|journal=Journal of the American Pharmacists Association|year=2005|volume=45|issue=3|pages=363–370|pmid=15991758|doi=10.1331/1544345054003868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, it was announced in February 2007 that [[Boots the Chemist]] would try over-the-counter sales of Viagra in stores in [[Manchester]], [[England]] (previous available as prescription only). Men aged between 30 and 65 could buy four tablets after a consultation with a [[pharmacist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6351171.stm |title=Over-the-counter Viagra piloted |date=2007-02-11 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Ernest Adolph''' (August 4, 1901- 17 June 1972)&lt;ref&gt;Year: 1910; Census Place: Philadelphia Ward 24,     Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Roll: T624_1397; Page: 9A; Enumeration     District: 0491; FHL microfilm: 1375410&lt;/ref&gt; was an American medical missionary born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Adolph served the China Inland Mission, now [[OMF International]], from 1929 to 1941 then served in the US Army Medical Corps as a Major from 1941 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;U.S., Social Security Death Index, 1935-2014 Number: 362-20-2433; Issue State: Michigan; Issue Date: Before 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Adolph returned to China to serve one last time from 1946 to 1949. After returning to the United States in 1949, he worked preparing missionaries for overseas work and restoring their health after contracting diseases. Once retired, Adolph served at his sons' hospitals in central Ethiopia and Bangladesh. Adolph opened two hospitals in Luan, Shansi and in Kaifeng, Henan and played a key role in the negotiations with Japanese military that kept hospitals open to Chinese populations during the [[Sino-Japanese War (1931-1945)|Sino-Japanese war]].

== Early life and education ==
Paul Adolph was born as the second son to Willhelma and William Adolph on August 4, 1901 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was younger brother to Edward (1895-1986) and William (1890-1958).&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives at Washington, D.C.; Washington,     D.C.; Passenger Lists of Vessels Arriving at San Francisco, California;     NAI Number: 4498993; Record Group Title: Records of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 1787-2004; Record Group Number: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolph was raised to speak German by his father who had been an engraver in the black forest of Germany. He attended [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]] in Philadelphia and graduated in 1919 speaking English, German, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the Central High School of Philadelphia|last=Philadelphia Central High School|first=|publisher=Mary Gaston Barnwell Foundation|year=1922|isbn=|location=Pennsylvania State University|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolph began his undergraduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania but transferred to [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]], where he graduated from in 1924 with a B.S. in chemistry and a B.A. in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://alumni.wheaton.edu/s/1156/index2col.aspx?sid=1156&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=314|title=Wheaton College Alumni and Parent Engagement|last=|first=|date=|website=Wheaton College|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolph studied medicine at the [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upg/upg7/programs.html|title=Commencement Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=Penn Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he attempted to master as many specialties as he could in anticipation of not having specialists in the missionary field. When Adolph became sick with Tuberculosis at the end of his last year, the school awarded him his M.D. in 1927 despite him being sent to recover at [[Edward Livingston Trudeau|Edward Livingston Trudeau's]] tuberculosis sanatorium in New York. While at the [[Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium|sanatorium]], he recovered and eventually joined the medical staff, taking on responsibilities in patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Surgery Speaks to China: The Experiences of a Medical Missionary to China in Peace and in War|last=Adolph|first=Paul|publisher=China Inland Mission|year=1945|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical work  ==
Adolph left the United States for China with the China Inland Mission for the first time in 1929. When he arrived in Beijing, then Peiking, he was able to visit his brother who was a professor of biochemistry in Beijing.
[[File:Shanxi CN.png|thumb|Shanxi, a province in northern China]]
Upon arrival in China, Adolph was first to spend six months at a language school in the Anhui province studying the Chinese language. After the six months, he proceeded to his residency at a hospital in Linfen in the province of Shanxi. Following a year of residency, Adolph was directed to open a 100 bed hospital in Luan, now Changzhi, in southeastern Shanxi. The missionaries that had previously worked in this region were no longer there as they had fled during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].

At the hospital in Changzhi, Adolph was the only doctor and carried out mostly surgical procedures. Initially, Adolph was received apprehensively in Luan and often called "foreign devil" by the children. He and his team made many efforts to integrate, such as wearing traditional Chinese clothing instead of American clothes. Patients at the hospital came from as far as 50 miles carried, walking, by wheelbarrow, or by cart. In his book, Surgery Speaks to China, Adolph recounts having to treat many cases of [[tuberculosis]] due to the unsanitary living conditions. Many times patients came with illnesses that had progressed beyond treatment and amputations were necessary. In these cases, the hospital had a carpenter on staff to build wooden legs. Adolph also reports many surgical cases to correct deformities, such as "hare-lip", or [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]].

One of the goals of Adolph while in China was to improve sanitation among midwives as they were the primary means of delivering babies throughout the region. He did so by observing deliveries with midwives and advising other midwives to practice already present, more sanitary methods such as burning the umbilical chord to sever it instead of using an unsanitary tool.

He also attempted to mend the sanitation issue by providing bathtubs at the hospital for patients and the public to use, as bathing was not a priority throughout the community. This combined with propaganda and example, especially using Adolph's infant son, proved to be effective. Adolph also made arrangements with poor patients to facilitate their care including providing housing until complete recovery and low, fixed costs. While in Changzhi, he would tour the province with his wife, son, a small medical team, and equipment in donated cars to treat people in rural areas. Clinics and operating theatres were set up in tents and many surgeries were able to be performed.

In spring of 1936, after the birth of his second son, Adolph returned to the United States where he took a year of graduate courses at the [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]]. After this and a course in general surgery, Adolph stayed to participate in research on [[sulfanilamide]].
[[File:Hebei CN.png|left|thumb|Hebei, a province in northern China]]
In November 1937, Adolph returned to China and worked in Shunteh (Xingtai), Hebei because his return to Changzhi was delayed by the fighting of the Sino-Japanese war. Upon his return, Adolph practiced mostly war medicine and extensively used the delimiting tourniquet. He later published a paper on the use of the delimiting tourniquet in wartime in China and accredits many survivals to its use. In September, 1938 he was able to return to Changzhi but without his family. That winter, Adolph traveled to Liaochao to partner with the [[Red Cross]] in opening a hospital that needed a doctor.

In 1939 a reoccurrence of tuberculosis caused Adolph to have to return to his family in Chefoo, now Yantai, for a five month rest period. After this rest period, Adolph began his journey back to Changzhi. Before arriving to Changzhi he received news they had been overtaken by Japanese forces and went to work at a hospital in Kaifeng instead. Here, he was free to practice as long as he cooperated with both Japanese and Chinese troops. Adolph continued to practice here until he returned to the United States in 1941.

When in the United States, Adolph practiced in industrial surgery in Detroit for six months and nine months as an associate to another surgeon in private practice before being commissioned to the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|Army Medical Corps]]. Major Adolph served in Scotland, France, and England as a US Army Surgeon before being  stationed at Fort Sheridan as Chief of Surgery in 1943. After a year at Fort Sheridan, Adolph was once again stationed in England and served as a Chief of Surgical Service at a general hospital. Major Adolph then served as a supervisor to eight German prisoner of war hospitals in France. The hospitals were for German patients and had German doctors, but were overseen by Americans. In a letter, Adolph reported that "Nazism has hindered the progress in the medical field" and new methods frequently had to be taught to the German doctors.

In August 1946, Adolph and his family had returned to Shanghai to continue working with the China Inland Mission. He became the school physician for the [[Shanghai American School]], a professor of surgery at the [[St. John's University, Shanghai|St. Johns Medical Schoo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l, the director of the China Inland Mission's medical work in China, and the operator of a hospital in Shanghai. He also worked in a clinic for the poor operated in front of his own compound.

Upon return to the United States, Adolph practiced in Kentucky before being debilitated by a stroke and a third occurrence of tuberculosis in 1950. For twenty years Adolph continued his involvement in the medical mission community in Chicago by preparing missionaries for working overseas and keeping them healthy after having contracted diseases abroad.After retirement, Adolph practiced at his son Harold's mission hospital in Ethiopia and his son Robert's mission hospital in Bangladesh.

== Personal life ==
Adolph married Vivian A. Adolph in June 1931 in Beijing and they honeymooned together in a nearby mountain range before being forced to evacuate due to war violence. They had two sons,  Robert (b. 12/14/1935) and Harold (b. 12/11/1932), who followed in their father's footsteps and entered the mission field as doctors.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives at Washington, D.C.; Washington,     D.C.; Passenger Lists of Vessels Arriving at San Francisco, California;     NAI Number: 4498993; Record Group Title: Records of the Immigration and     Naturalization Service, 1787-2004; Record Group Number: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

While serving in China, Adolph was curious of the history of [[Shennong|Shen Nung]], the father of Chinese medicine and the divine husbandman. He made trips to the Taihang Mountain to explore the temple and speak to the monks.&lt;ref&gt;Collection 169 - Harold Paul     Adolph. T2 Transcript. May 11, 1999. Accessed December 08, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www2.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/trans/169t02.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life and death ==
Toward the end of his career, Adolph spent time advising the China Inland Mission and working with his sons in the mission field. He accompanied his sons to sites in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, where they established hospitals. While working in Ethiopia, Adolph died at the age of 70 in June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archon.wheaton.edu/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=686&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=407481#id407481 Oral History Interview with Harold P. Adolph]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Adolph established the Sixth Peoples Hospital of Shanghai through his work with the China Inland Mission. The initially 100 bed hospital is now a large, 1,000 bed modern hospital.  While working in China during wartime, Adolph was responsible for negotiating with both sides to continue providing medical care to communities caught in the middle of the fighting. Adolph also helped communities. He also assisted in founding his sons' hospitals in Bangladesh under the Sudan Interior Mission and southern Ethiopia.

In 1959 Adolph was awarded the Distinguished Service to Society Award by Wheaton College, his alma mater.

'''Periodic fever syndromes''' (also known as '''autoinflammatory diseases''' or '''autoinflammatory syndromes''') are a set of disorders characterized by recurrent episodes of systemic and organ-specific [[inflammation]]. Unlike autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, in which the disease is caused by abnormalities of the [[adaptive immune system]], patients with autoinflammatory diseases do not produce [[autoantibodies]] or antigen-specific T or B cells.  Instead, the autoinflammatory diseases are characterized by errors in the [[innate immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;Masters SL, Simon A, Aksentijevich I, et al. Horror autoinflammaticus: the molecular pathophysiology of autoinflammatory disease*. Annu Rev Immunol 2009;27(1):621–68&lt;/ref&gt;

The syndromes are diverse, but tend to cause episodes of fever, [[arthralgia|joint pains]], skin rashes, [[abdominal pain]]s and may lead to chronic complications such as [[amyloidosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid16093838"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stojanov S, Kastner DL |title=Familial autoinflammatory diseases: genetics, pathogenesis and treatment |journal=Curr Opin Rheumatol |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=586–99 |year=2005 |pmid=16093838 |doi=10.1097/bor.0000174210.78449.6b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most autoinflammatory diseases are genetic and present during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hausmann|first1=JS|last2=Dedeoglu|first2=F|title=Autoinflammatory diseases in pediatrics.|journal=Dermatologic clinics|date=July 2013|volume=31|issue=3|pages=481–94|doi=10.1016/j.det.2013.04.003|pmid=23827250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common genetic autoinflammatory syndrome is [[familial Mediterranean fever]], which causes short episodes of fever, abdominal pain, [[serositis]], lasting less than 72 hours.  It is caused by mutations in the [[MEFV]] gene, which codes for the protein [[pyrin]].

Pyrin is a protein normally present in the [[inflammasome]].  The mutated pyrin protein is thought to cause inappropriate activation of the inflammasome, leading to release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine [[IL-1β]].  Most other autoinflammatory diseases also cause disease by inappropriate release of IL-1β.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jamilloux|first1=Y|last2=Bourdonnay|first2=E|last3=Gerfaud-Valentin|first3=M|last4=Py|first4=BF|last5=Lefeuvre|first5=L|last6=Barba|first6=T|last7=Broussolle|first7=C|last8=Henry|first8=T|last9=Sève|first9=P|title=[Interleukin-1, inflammasome and autoinflammatory diseases].|journal=La Revue de medecine interne|date=14 September 2016|pmid=27639913|doi=10.1016/j.revmed.2016.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, IL-1β has become a common therapeutic target, and medications such as [[anakinra]], [[rilonacept]], and [[canakinumab]] have revolutionized the treatment of autoinflammatory diseases.

However, there are some autoinflammatory diseases that are not known to have a clear genetic cause.  This includes [[PFAPA]], which is the most common autoinflammatory disease seen in children, characterized by episodes of fever, [[aphthous stomatitis]], [[pharyngitis]], and cervical [[adenitis]].  Other autoinflammatory diseases that do not have clear genetic causes include [[adult-onset Still's disease]], [[systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis]], [[Schnitzler syndrome]], and [[chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis]].  It is likely that these diseases are multifactorial, with genes that make people susceptible to these diseases, but they require an additional environmental factor to trigger the disease.

Another example that shows that autoinflamatory conditions may not be genetic in origin is found in a report published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;John R. Lukens, Prajwal Gurung, Peter Vogel, Gordon R. Johnson, Robert A. Carter, Daniel J. McGoldrick, Srinivasa Rao Bandi, Christopher R. Calabrese, Lieselotte Vande Walla, Mohamed Lamkanfi y Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti (2014). “Dietary modulation of the microbiome affects autoinflammatory disease”.&lt;/ref&gt; which shows that diet is very important in the development of such diseases. The ingestion levels of highly [[saturated fats]] and [[cholesterol]], (high fat diet, HFD) affects the [[microbiota]] composition of the gut. Changes in the microbiota induced by a HFD are protective against the susceptibility to develop osteomyelitis (autoimmune disease) as compared with the changes induced by a low-fat diet. The changes in the microbiome of individuals under HFD showed a reduction in ''[[Prevotella]]'' abundance and were accompanied by significantly reduced expression levels of pro-[[Interleukin 1 family|Interleukin-1β]] in distant [[neutrophils]].

'''[[Polyclinic]]s in England''' were intended to offer a greater range of services than were offered by current [[general practitioner]] (GP) practices and local health centres. In addition to traditional GP services they would offer extended urgent care, healthy living services, community mental health services and social care, whilst being more accessible and less medicalised than hospitals.&lt;ref name="A Framework for Action"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Professor the Lord Darzi of Denham KBE |publisher=[[NHS London]] |title=Healthcare for London: A Framework for Action |accessdate=17 August 2008 |url=http://www.healthcareforlondon.nhs.uk/pdf/aFrameworkForAction.pdf |format=pdf |date=11 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227015036/http://www.healthcareforlondon.nhs.uk/pdf/aFrameworkForAction.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of models were proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Professor the Lord Darzi of Denham KBE |publisher=[[NHS London]] |title=Healthcare for London: A Framework for Action, p.93 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |url=http://www.healthcareforlondon.nhs.uk/pdf/aFrameworkForAction.pdf |format=pdf |date=11 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227015036/http://www.healthcareforlondon.nhs.uk/pdf/aFrameworkForAction.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Consulting the Capital"&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=[[NHS London]] |title=Healthcare for London: Consulting the Capital, p.41 |accessdate=18 August 2008 |url=http://www.healthcareforlondon.nhs.uk/pdf/consultingTheCapital.pdf |format=pdf |date=30 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230102839/http://www.healthcareforlondon.nhs.uk/pdf/consultingTheCapital.pdf |archivedate=30 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from networks of existing clinics to larger premises with several colocated [[general practitioner]] (GP) practices, more extensive facilities and additional services provided by [[Allied health professions|allied healthcare professionals]].

The incoming health secretary in May 2010 [[Andrew Lansley]] put on hold all plans to increase numbers of polyclinics and to relocate GPs to them pending a review of policy under the new coalition government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=35&amp;storycode=4126086&amp;c=2 |title=Lansley orders halt to all Darzi plans nationwide |author=Ian Quinn |publisher=Pulse |date=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a review by management consultants [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] revealed "NHS managers had vastly overestimated the ability of polysystems to handle the shift in care from hospitals and revolutionise GP care".

==Polyclinic services==

The polyclinic model proposed in London will provide:
*[[general practitioner|GP services]] – e.g. core and enhanced with extended opening hours
*Other health services – including other health professionals (e.g. [[ophthalmology]], [[dentistry]])
*Minor procedures
*[[Outpatient]] appointments
*[[Urgent care]]
*[[Diagnosis (medical)|Diagnostics]] – e.g. core and enhanced testing with extended opening hours
*Community services – e.g. interactive health information, management of [[chronic (medical)|long term conditions]], complex needs, [[Nursing in the United Kingdom|community nursing]], [[Community mental health services|community mental health teams]]
*Co-located services – e.g. including [[Local government in England|local authority]], [[social care]], [[mental health]], [[leisure]] and the [[London Ambulance Service]]

The government accepts that the polyclinic model may not be suitable for rural areas but may be popular in the larger [[conurbation]]s.

==History==

[[Community health center#United Kingdom|Health Centre]]s offering a mix of community-based health care services have existed in England since the early years of the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS). They have typically provided specialist care such as ophthalmology, podiatry, dentistry, minor injuries nursing, and therefore provided services that fell between that of the GP service and those available at the hospital.

Some primary care trusts in England  attempted to bring together even more services into such centres, most notably by co-locating GPs, health laboratories, pharmacies and other services under one roof. The Heart of Hounslow Centre for Health for example has GP services, outpatient care, physiotherapy, dentistry, podiatry, social care outreach, mental health services for children and a gym to help in rehabilitation. All these services take place in a purpose-built facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/polyclinic.html |author=Victoria Vaughan |publisher=''[[Health Service Journal]]'' |title=London unveils first polyclinic |work= |accessdate=5 September 2008 |date=6 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107152747/http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/polyclinic.html |archivedate=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the centre does not provide urgent care and only has a limited range of diagnostics.

Polyclinics were proposed only for London by [[Ara Darzi, Baron Darzi of Denham|Professor the Lord Darzi of Denham]] in his review of healthcare in London for [[NHS London]]: ''Healthcare for London: A Framework for Action''.&lt;ref name="A Framework for Action"/&gt; In the final report of his subsequent national review for the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], ''High Quality Care for All''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Professor the Lord Darzi of Denham KBE |publisher=Department of Health |title=High Quality Care for All: NHS Next Stage Review final report |accessdate=17 August 2008 |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_085825 |date=30 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Darzi has not suggested that polyclinics would be appropriate elsewhere; instead he suggests "GP-led health centres". He explained the difference between the two models to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Health Select Committee]] on 19 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmhealth/uc937-ii/uc93702.htm |author=|publisher=[[Hansard]] |title=Uncorrected transcript of oral evidence to the House of Commons Health Select Committee |work=|accessdate=4 September 2008 |date=17 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key principle of ''A Framework for Action'' is to "localise where possible, centralise where necessary." This would move "routine healthcare" away from acute hospitals and into community-based centres to provide a one-stop-shop for health care. "More complex care" would remain centralised. A key part of the plan is to extend the opening times of such centres, especially in the evenings, to make them more accessible to working people.

While polyclinics had not been widely implemented across England prior to 2008, they have existed in Australia, France, Germany (since 2004), Northern Ireland, Switzerland and Russia;&lt;ref name="NHS polyclinics"/&gt; and in many countries across Asia and Africa, although several of these countries are now seeking to remove them.&lt;ref name="RCGP roadmap"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-85084-315-6 |url=http://www.rcgp.org.uk/policy/rcgp-policy-areas/~/media/Files/Policy/A-Z-policy/the_future_direction_rcgp_roadmap.ashx |last1=Lakhani |first1=Prof. Mayur |authorlink1=Mayur Lakhani |last2=Baker |first2=Dr. Maureen |authorlink2=Maureen Baker |last3=Field |first3=Prof. Steve |authorlink3=Steve Field (medical doctor) |title=The Future Direction of General Practice – a roadmap |format=pdf |year=2007 |work=|accessdate=3 May 2015 |publisher=Royal College of General Practitioners |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, where they were introduced under communism, attempts were made to replace them with a more western model by the new Russian government. However, the Russian polyclinic model proved robust and the authorities' prescriptive interference failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ershova |first1=I |last2=Rider |first2=O |last3=Gorelov |first3=V |title=Polyclinics in London |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9603 |pages=1890–1 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18068500 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61793-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==

The [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and the government claimed that polyclinics offer:
#A way of providing more services in the community closer to home and at more convenient times (including [[antenatal care|antenatal]] and [[postnatal|postnatal care]], healthy living information, community mental health services, community care, and social care and specialist advice)
#An improved structure within which GPs and other health and social care professionals can work together
#Improved care for patients with chronic or complex conditions
#A shift in the focus of urgent care out of hospitals and into polyclinics.&lt;ref name="NHS polyclinics"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.library.nhs.uk/HealthManagement/ViewResource.aspx?resID=267332|title=NLH – Health Management – Polyclinics|format=|work=|accessdate=3 July 2008}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the [[King's Fund]] has questioned many of these, observing that:
#Access to services was likely to be harder in rural areas and in urban areas where new buildings were not situated close to transport hubs
#Simply putting healthcare professionals in the same location is in practice often not sufficient to generate co-working or integration of care
#While the co-location of multiple services presents opportunities for delivering more [[integrated care]], particularly for people with chronic diseases, the evidence suggests that in practice these opportunities are often lost, and accessibility of primary care is likely to be reduced for most patients if their GPs move into polyclinics, particularly in rural settings (a point emphasised in ''[[The Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4116262.ece |title=What is wrong with polyclinics? Try the death of GP care |author=Keith Hopcroft |publisher=''[[The Times]]'' |format=|work=|accessdate=3 July 2008 |date=12 June 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
#There is limited evidence that quality of care for services shifted out of hospitals is comparable, and there is evidence that quality may be decreased in certain cases; the limited inspection and accreditation of out-of-hospital care is also a serious deficit in quality assurance

The report also observed that the proposals were likely to increase professional isolation, and threaten both professional development and motivation, and continuity of care, and that pre-existing problems in healthcare to do with the lack of an overall governance structure, and unclear lines of accountability had not been addressed.

It concluded that while polyclinics offered real opportunities for some health communities to establish more integrated, patient-focused care, these would only be realised with considerable investment of time, effort and resources into their planning and development, and that the primary focus should be on developing new pathways, technologies and ways of working rather than new buildings.&lt;ref name="King's Fund - polyclinics"&gt;{{cite book |title=Will polyclinics deliver integrated care? |publisher=The King's Fund |last=Imison |first=Candace |author2=Naylor, Chris |author3=Maybin, Jo |url=http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/kings_fund_publications/under_one_roof.html |accessdate=3 July 2008 |date=5 June 2008 |isbn=978-1-85717-569-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614051125/http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/kings_fund_publications/under_one_roof.html |archive-date=14 June 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[David Cameron]] did not object in principle to the case for polyclinics but is worried that they might be imposed against the wishes of communities. He suggested that close to 1,600 GP surgeries may have to close across the country as a whole if polyclinics were established in the way the government is suggesting.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=webcameron.story.page&amp;obj_id=143765&amp;speeches=1 |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20080608071334/https://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=webcameron.story.page&amp;obj_id=143765&amp;speeches=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 June 2008 |author=David Cameron |date=21 April 2008 |title=David Cameron: Speech on Primary Care }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Health Minister [[Ben Bradshaw]], however, denied that individual GP practices would be closed as patients would remain registered with their existing GPs.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Polyclinics-lead-loss-patients-GPs-says-minister/article-237977-detail/article.html |title=GPs fears about polyclinics |work= |accessdate=24 August 2008 |date=28 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806145752/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Polyclinics-lead-loss-patients-GPs-says-minister/article-237977-detail/article.html |archive-date=6 August 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures have also been dismissed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=23&amp;storycode=4120435&amp;c=2 |publisher=''[[Pulse (magazine)|Pulse]]'' |title=Row breaks out over polyclinic impact on nearby surgeries |accessdate=27 August 2008 |date=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Dr Laurence Buckman, chair of the [[British Medical Association]]'s General Practitioners Committee.

==Funding==

It was unclear whether polyclinics would be funded in addition to existing GP services or whether they will take funding away from existing practices. Although Lord Darzi claimed that their funding would be in addition to existing funding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/programmes/andrew_marr_show/7491912.stm |title=No GP surgeries will close |format=|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=24 August 2008 |date=6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the publication of his report, eight London [[NHS primary care trust|primary care trusts]] drew up plans to relocate more than 100 urban GP surgeries into polyclinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23487984-details/100+GP+sites+facing+axe+under+polyclinic+plans/article.do |author=Anna Davis |publisher=''[[Evening Standard]]'' |title=100 GP sites facing axe under polyclinic plans |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=18 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529002802/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23487984-details/100+GP+sites+facing+axe+under+polyclinic+plans/article.do |archive-date=29 May 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party claimed that unless existing surgeries close, polyclinics will leave a £1.4&amp;nbsp;billion "black hole" in public finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sara Gaines |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'', Comment is Free |title=NHS polyclinic plans will leave £1.4bn black hole, Tories claim |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jun/11/nhs.health1 |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=18 August 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

Polyclinics were originally planned for and implemented in London, with every [[primary care trust]] in the country subsequently required to have at least one new "GP-led health centre".&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080617/debtext/80617-0007.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 17 Jun 2008 (pt 0007) |work= |publisher=[[Hansard]] |accessdate=24 August 2008 |date=17 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605024218/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080617/debtext/80617-0007.htm |archive-date=5 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article4120007.ece |title=Doctors' leaders claim patients will suffer from polyclinics plan |publisher=''[[The Times]]'' |format=|work=|accessdate=24 August 2008 |date=12 June 2008 |location=London |first=David |last=Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the first wave of polyclinics in London, which formed a pilot of the model, were of the [[federation|federated]]/[[Social network|networked]] model and involved "existing services working more closely together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/2008/09/london_denies_polyclinic_uturn.html |author=Dave West |publisher=''[[Health Service Journal]]'' |title=London denies polyclinic U-turn |work=|accessdate=4 September 2008 |date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2008, more than a quarter of PCTs had plans to implement a polyclinic or GP-led health centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=23&amp;storycode=4120359&amp;c=1 |publisher=''[[Pulse (magazine)|Pulse]]'' |title=Darzi polyclinics just the tip of the iceberg as second wave revealed |format=|work=|accessdate=24 August 2008 |date=12 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Birmingham, Cumbria, Lincolnshire, Rochdale, Cheshire, Essex and Bolton. More than 50 PCTs admitted that they would not consult local communities over plans to build polyclinics, some citing advice from the Department of Health as the reason, despite repeated government promises that they would not be introduced without consultation.&lt;ref name="Sunday Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/2490319/Polyclinics-will-be-imposed-despite-ministers-promises.html |title=Polyclinics will be imposed despite ministers' promises |publisher=''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' |date=3 August 2008 |work=|accessdate=25 August 2008 |location=London |first=Laura |last=Donnelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country-wide rollout of GP-led health centres was criticised by doctors' leaders and patient groups. Dr. [[Richard Vautrey]], deputy chairman of the BMA, called it "a government plan that is potentially going to waste hundreds of millions of pounds of scarce NHS resources, creating very large health centres that many areas of the country simply don't need or want",&lt;ref name="Times-Vautrey"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article3380852.ece |title=Polyclinics to replace traditional doctors' surgeries |publisher=''[The Times]'' |date=16 February 2008 |format=|work=|accessdate=25 August 2008 |location=London |first=Simon |last=Alford}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Patients Association noted that gathering services under one roof in rural areas "may actually put patients at risk" and noted that rural patients already had to travel further and were more reliant on primary care.&lt;ref name="Patients Association"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patients-association.org.uk/News/215 |title=Polyclinics |publisher=The Patients Association|format=|work=|accessdate=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other political parties have also criticised it, with the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] [[Nick Clegg]] calling it "the central imposition of a polyclinic on every primary care trust, regardless of the geography, demographics and clinical needs of the area" while acknowledging that they might be a good thing for people in some communities&lt;ref name="Clegg"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/2103692/Nick-Clegg-Polyclinics-are-being-imposed-across-country.html |title=Nick Clegg: Polyclinics are being imposed across country |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |work=|accessdate=24 August 2008 |date=10 June 2008 |author=Graham Tibbetts |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Conservative leader David Cameron suggesting large-scale closures of existing GP surgeries.&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt;

The results of a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|freedom of information]] request by ''[[Pulse (magazine)|Pulse]]'' on the plans for polyclinics show that nursing staff could outnumber doctors by up to three to one. The BMA said the plans would lead to "cut-price general practice". A spokesperson for the Department of Health said "where people choose to register with a GP-led health centre, they should expect the same quality and continuity of care from GPs and other primary care clinicians as they would from any other GP practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=35&amp;storycode=4120555 |author=Gareth Iacobucci |publisher=''[[Pulse (magazine)|Pulse]]'' |title=Nurses to outnumber GPs three to one in Darzi centres |format=|work=|accessdate=10 September 2008 |date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/health/2712898/Polyclinics-will-contain-three-nurses-to-every-GP.html |title=Polyclinics 'will contain three nurses to every GP' |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |work= |accessdate=10 September 2008 |date=10 September 2008 |author=Kate Devlin |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910115309/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/health/2712898/Polyclinics-will-contain-three-nurses-to-every-GP.html |archivedate=10 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion==

Opinion on the plans for polyclinics was polarised.

''Polyclinics are based on long term trends of what works best in healthcare, and in fact there are many practices successfully operating under a similar model already. As such we have been genuinely surprised to see the level of concern surrounding these proposals among the health community and patient groups. What we need now is a calm and balanced debate about how to bring out the best in our primary care services. The name may pose a problem. Polyclinics may be associated with the previous soviet system of healthcare, however what is proposed here has no real connection to this at all. While it may sound like the polyclinic system will not resemble the service currently provided by family doctors, in reality it should build on what is best in general practice. Of course this is not something that will work in every circumstance, but delivering better organised care focused on the patient is surely a good thing. This is why it is crucial that politicians and health professionals fully engage with the benefits that polyclinics can bring. Knee jerk reactions focussing on possible problems based on pre-existing agendas rather than potential solutions could seriously jeopardise progress for patients.''

''With HIV now a long-term condition, polyclinics have a very important role in the delivery of HIV care. Many routine services, such as regular blood tests and check ups shouldn't require a trip to a hospital-based clinic. Integrating services can only make life easier for people living with HIV so it's definitely a welcome move.''&lt;ref name="NHS London 20080910"/&gt;

* Samantha Mauger, Chief Executive of [[Age Concern]] London, said:

''We welcome the intention of providing an integrated local health centre delivering a wide range of services in a joined-up approach. If this is done with care it could benefit many older people. While older people may be worried about possible changes to the services they currently use, many suffer at present from lack of coordination between different health and social care services. The NHS needs to work with and listen to local people's views about the services to be provided. We need improved, responsive services and easy access for Londoners of all ages from all communities.''&lt;ref name="NHS London 20080910"/&gt;

*Although government-backed, one study by Professor Martin Roland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/staff/MartinRoland University of Manchester – School of Medicine – Professor Martin Roland CBE] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070212105851/http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/staff/MartinRoland |date=12 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[University of Manchester]] concluded that such clinics are likely to offer poorer choice and worse access than traditional GP surgeries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Hospital and GP reforms 'flawed' |date=21 March 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2008 |author=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7306779.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they have faced opposition from doctors, health experts, and patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nancollas CE |title=Doctors warn of premature move to polyclinics: Joined-up thinking? |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7647 |pages=736 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18390503 |pmc=2287242 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39535.425139.1F |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian July 07"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jul/11/health.medicineandhealth |title=Health experts condemn London polyclinic plans |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=11 July 2007 |format=|work=|accessdate=22 May 2010|first=David |last=Batty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Polyclinics were a centrepiece of the Soviet model of healthcare delivery, but many countries of Central and Eastern Europe have abandoned them over the past two decades in favour of a system of general practice that draws extensively on the British model.

* The [[British Medical Association]] was opposed to polyclinics from the start, observing that larger clinics were already emerging where needed, that forcing their introduction was wasteful and costly, and that they would undermine the value of a relationship existing between GP and patient.&lt;ref name="observer 2008-02-17"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/feb/17/nhs.health1 |title=GPs' leader hits out at plans for Soviet-style 'polyclinics' |publisher=''[[The Observer]]'' |format=|work=|accessdate=3 July 2008|date=17 February 2008 |location=London |first=Anushka |last=Asthana}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have further commented that the design of the proposals appears deliberately to disadvantage existing GPs from applying to run the clinics, leaving the way open for privatisation of GP services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Doctors fear 'GP privatisation' |accessdate=6 July 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7159270.stm |date=26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A significant proportion of the general public are opposed to polyclinics, with more than a million signing the British Medical Association's petition against them.&lt;ref name="BMJ O'Dowd"/&gt; Press reports suggested that they were unpopular with patients, particularly the elderly, who feared polyclinics would ruin their relationship with their doctor and were finding they had to travel further to see a doctor.&lt;ref name="Spiked "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/5414/ |title=Editorial: I don't want any more 'patient choice'! |publisher=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]] |format=|work=|date=1 July 2008 |author=Brendan O'Neill |accessdate=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, of the 4,372 individual responses and 359 organisational responses{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} to [[NHS London]]'s official consultation, 51% supported the proposal that "almost all GP practices in London should be part of a polyclinic, either networked or same-site".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Healthcare for London – Consulting the Capital update |publisher=[[NHS London]] |date=6 May 2008 |url=http://www.london.nhs.uk/news-and-health-issues/press-releases/latest-press-releases/healthcare-for-london--consulting-the-capital-update |accessdate=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/announcements/2008/05/half_the_capital_back_polyclinics.html |title=Londoners back polyclinics, survey shows |author=|publisher=''[[Health Service Journal]]'' |work=|accessdate=14 August 2008 |date=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consultation noted that some respondents were concerned about the effect of polyclinics on the GP-patient relationship, worse continuity of care, possible extra travel time, cost, governance, and whether the money would be better spent on improving existing services.&lt;ref name="Consultation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareforlondon.nhs.uk/consultationDocs/080701Consultationreportv3final.pdf |format=pdf |title=Report on the consultation and recommendations for change |publisher=[[NHS London]] |work= |accessdate=25 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230101807/http://www.healthcareforlondon.nhs.uk/consultationDocs/080701Consultationreportv3final.pdf |archivedate=30 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Patients Association]] was concerned that polyclinics could jeopardise the patient-doctor relationship which they regard as a central plank of effective and personalised care and as "central to every patient's experience of healthcare", particularly in those with long-term or complex conditions. They also observed that polyclinics are not necessary to providing one-stop care, something already delivered in the NHS at one stop shops, and that they are likely to lead to the loss of other health services in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Patients Association"/&gt;
* The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] criticised polyclinics as part of the government's "obsession with imposing models of care from the centre", noting that this flies in the face of their "rhetoric on local decision-making".&lt;ref name="observer 2008-02-17"/&gt;
* The [[NHS Alliance]] called polyclinics "lost in translation", commenting that while they are good when implemented in the right way, this "means general practices locally deciding to integrate their services" with willingness from both doctors and local people. "The BMA and patients are afraid that they might be losing the good bits of general practice – and the way that polyclinics have been implemented in some places means they have got a point."&lt;ref name="BMJ O'Dowd"&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Dowd A |title=More than a million people signed petition against polyclinics |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7658 |pages=1399 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18559361 |pmc=2432154 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a375 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
It is typically due to a bacterial infection, most commonly ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; Risk factors include [[sexual intercourse]], prior [[urinary tract infections]], [[diabetes]], structural problems of the [[urinary tract]], and [[spermicide]] use.&lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lip2011/&gt; The mechanism of infection is usually spread up the [[Urinary system|urinary tract]].&lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; Less often infection occurs through the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and supported by [[urinalysis]].&lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; If there is no improvement with treatment, [[medical imaging]] may be recommended.&lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of acute pyelonephritis generally develop rapidly over a few hours or a day. It can cause high fever, [[Dysuria|pain on passing urine]], and abdominal pain that radiates along the flank towards the back.

Pyelonephritis that has progressed to urosepsis may be accompanied by [[Medical sign|signs]] of [[septic shock]], including [[tachypnea|rapid breathing]], [[hypotension|decreased blood pressure]], [[Chills|shivering]], and occasionally [[delirium]].

==Causes==
Most cases of "community-acquired" pyelonephritis are due to bowel organisms that enter the urinary tract. Common organisms are ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' (70&amp;ndash;80%) and ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]''. [[Nosocomial infection|Hospital-acquired infections]] may be due to [[coliform bacteria]] and enterococci, as well as other organisms uncommon in the community (e.g., ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and various species of ''[[Klebsiella]]''). Most cases of pyelonephritis start off as lower urinary tract infections, mainly [[cystitis]] and [[prostatitis]].&lt;ref name=Ramakrishnan2005/&gt; ''E. coli'' can invade the superficial umbrella cells of the bladder to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs), which can mature into [[biofilm]]s. These biofilm-producing ''E. coli'' are resistant to antibiotic therapy and immune system responses, and present a possible explanation for recurrent urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis.&lt;ref name=Hultgren2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Hultgren|first=SJ|title=Pathogenic Cascade of E. coli UTI|work=UTI Pathogenesis|publisher=Molecular Microbiology and Microbial Pathogenesis Program, Washington University|location=St. Louis, Missouri|year=2011|url=http://www.hultgrenlab.wustl.edu/pathcascade.shtml|accessdate=2011-06-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829090655/http://www.hultgrenlab.wustl.edu/pathcascade.shtml|archivedate=2006-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk is increased in the following situations:&lt;ref name=Ramakrishnan2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholes2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scholes|first=D|author2=Hooton TM |author3=Roberts PL |author4=Gupta K |author5=Stapleton AE |author6=Stamm WE |title=Risk factors associated with acute pyelonephritis in healthy women|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=142|issue=1|pages=20–7|year=2005|pmid=15630106|url=http://www.annals.org/content/142/1/20.full.pdf|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-142-1-200501040-00008|pmc=3722605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

===Laboratory examination===
[[Urinalysis|Analysis of the urine]] may show signs of urinary tract infection. Specifically, the presence of [[Nitrite test|nitrite]] and [[white blood cell]]s on a [[urine test strip]] in patients with typical symptoms are sufficient for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis, and are an indication for [[empirical treatment]]. [[Blood test]]s such as a [[complete blood count]] may show [[neutrophilia]]. [[Microbiological culture]] of the urine, with or without [[blood culture]]s and [[Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing|antibiotic sensitivity testing]] are useful for establishing a formal diagnosis,&lt;ref name=Ramakrishnan2005/&gt; and are considered mandatory.&lt;ref name=Gupta2011&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gupta K, Hooton TM, Naber KG, Wullt B, Colgan R, Miller LG, Moran GJ, Nicolle LE, Raz R, Schaeffer AJ, Soper DE|title=International Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Acute Uncomplicated Cystitis and Pyelonephritis in Women: A 2010 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=52|issue=5|pages=e103–20|year=2011|pmid=21292654|doi=10.1093/cid/ciq257|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/5/e103.full.pdf|displayauthors=2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710104935/http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/5/e103.full.pdf|archivedate=2012-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imaging studies===
If a kidney stone is suspected (e.g. on the basis of characteristic [[Renal colic|colicky pain]] or the presence of a disproportionate amount of blood in the urine), a [[kidneys, ureters, and bladder x-ray]] (KUB film) may assist in identifying [[radiodensity|radioopaque]] stones.&lt;ref name=Ramakrishnan2005/&gt; Where available, a noncontrast [[Helical cone beam computed tomography|helical CT scan]] with 5&amp;nbsp;millimeter sections is the diagnostic modality of choice in the radiographic evaluation of suspected nephrolithiasis.&lt;ref name=Pearle2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearle|first1=MS|last2=Calhoun|first2=EA|last3=Curhan|first3=GC|editor-last=Litwin|editor-first=MS|editor2-last=Saigal|editor2-first=CS|title=Urologic Diseases in America (NIH Publication No. 07–5512)|chapter=Chapter 8: Urolithiasis|pages=283–319|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|location=Bethesda, Maryland|year=2007|url=http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/statistics/uda/Urolithiasis-Chapter08.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915045339/http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/statistics/uda/Urolithiasis-Chapter08.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SmithCentennial2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=RC|last2=Varanelli|first2=M|title=Diagnosis and Management of Acute Ureterolithiasis: CT Is Truth|journal=American Journal of Roentgenology|volume=175|issue=1|pages=3–6|year=2000|pmid=10882237|url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/175/1/3.pdf|doi=10.2214/ajr.175.1.1750003}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fang2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Fang|first=LST|editor-last=Goroll|editor-first=AH|editor2-last=Mulley|editor2-first=AG|title=Primary care medicine: office evaluation and management of the adult patient|edition=6th|chapter=Chapter 135: Approach to the Paient with Nephrolithiasis|pages=962–7|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7817-7513-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bIZvJPcSEXMC&amp;pg=PA964&amp;lpg=PA964&amp;dq=nephrolithiasis+%22physical+examination%22#v=onepage&amp;q=nephrolithiasis%20%22physical%20examination%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; All stones are detectable on CT scans except very rare stones composed of certain drug residues in the urine.&lt;ref name=Pietrow2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietrow|first=PK|author2=Karellas ME|title=Medical Management of Common Urinary Calculi|journal=American Family Physician|volume=74|issue=1|pages=86–94|year=2006|pmid=16848382|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0701/p86.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123060406/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0701/p86.pdf|archivedate=2011-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In patients with recurrent ascending urinary tract infections, it may be necessary to exclude an anatomical abnormality, such as vesicoureteral reflux or [[polycystic kidney disease]].

===Classification===

====Acute pyelonephritis====
Acute pyelonephritis is an [[exudate|exudative]] [[Pus|purulent]] localized [[inflammation]] of the [[renal pelvis]] (collecting system) and kidney. The [[Nephron|kidney parenchyma]] presents in the interstitium abscesses (suppurative [[necrosis]]), consisting in purulent exudate (pus): neutrophils, fibrin, cell debris and central germ colonies (hematoxylinophils). Tubules are damaged by exudate and may contain neutrophil casts. In the early stages, the [[glomerulus]] and vessels are normal. Gross pathology often reveals pathognomonic radiations of [[bleeding]] and [[Pus|suppuration]] through the renal pelvis to the [[renal cortex]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

====Chronic pyelonephritis====
Chronic pyelonephritis implies recurrent kidney infections and can result in [[fibrosis|scarring]] of the renal parenchyma and impaired function, especially in the setting of obstruction. A perinephric [[abscess]] (infection around the kidney) and/or pyonephrosis may develop in severe cases of pyelonephritis.&lt;ref name=Griebling2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griebling|first1=TL|editor-last=Litwin|editor-first=MS|editor2-last=Saigal|editor2-first=CS|title=Urologic Diseases in America (NIH Publication No. 07–5512)|chapter=Chapter 18: Urinary Tract Infection in Women|pages=589–619|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|location=Bethesda, Maryland|year=2007|url=http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/statistics/uda/Urinary_Tract_Infection_in_Women-Chapter18.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927030715/http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/statistics/uda/Urinary_Tract_Infection_in_Women-Chapter18.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis====
[[Xanthogranulomatous inflammation|Xanthogranulomatous]] pyelonephritis is an unusual form of chronic pyelonephritis characterized by [[granuloma]]tous [[abscess]] formation, severe kidney destruction, and a clinical picture that may resemble [[renal cell carcinoma]] and other inflammatory [[nephron|kidney parenchymal]] diseases. Most affected individuals present with recurrent fevers and urosepsis, [[anemia]], and a painful kidney mass. Other common manifestations include kidney stones and loss of function of the affected kidney. Bacterial cultures of kidney tissue are almost always positive.&lt;ref name=Malek1978&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malek|first1=RS|last2=Elder|first2=JS|title=Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: a critical analysis of 26 cases and of the literature|journal=Journal of Urology|volume=119|issue=5|pages=589–93|year=1978|pmid=660725|doi=10.1016/s0022-5347(17)57559-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Histopathology|Microscopically]], there are granulomas and [[lipid]]-laden [[macrophage]]s (hence the term ''xantho''-, which means yellow in [[ancient Greek]]). It is found in roughly 20% of specimens from surgically managed cases of pyelonephritis.&lt;ref name=Korkes2008/&gt;

==Management==
In people suspected of having pyelonephritis, a urine culture and [[antibiotic sensitivity]] test is performed, so therapy can eventually be tailored on the basis of the infecting organism.&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt; As most cases of pyelonephritis are due to bacterial infections, antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment.&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt; The choice of antibiotic depends on the species and antibiotic sensitivity profile of the infecting organism, and may include [[Quinolone antibiotic|fluoroquinolones]], [[cephalosporin]]s, [[aminoglycoside]]s, or [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]], either alone or in combination.&lt;ref name=Gupta2011/&gt;

===Simple===
In people who do not require hospitalization and live in an area where there is a low prevalence of [[Antibiotic resistance|antibiotic-resistant]] bacteria, a fluoroquinolone by mouth such as [[ciprofloxacin]] or [[levofloxacin]] is an appropriate initial choice for therapy.&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt; In areas where there is a higher prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance, it is useful to initiate treatment with a single intravenous dose of a long-acting antibiotic such as [[ceftriaxone]] or an aminoglycoside, and then continuing treatment with a fluoroquinolone. Oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is an appropriate choice for therapy if the bacteria is known to be susceptible.&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt; If trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is used when the susceptibility is not known, it is useful to initiate treatment with a single intravenous dose of a long-acting antibiotic such as ceftriaxone or an aminoglycoside. Oral [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s are less effective than other available agents for treatment of pyelonephritis.&lt;ref name=Gupta2011/&gt; Improvement is expected in 48 to 72 hours.&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt;

===Complicated===
People with acute pyelonephritis that is accompanied by high fever and [[leukocytosis]] are typically admitted to the hospital for intravenous hydration and intravenous antibiotic treatment. Treatment is typically initiated with an intravenous fluoroquinolone, an aminoglycoside, an [[extended-spectrum penicillin]] or cephalosporin, or a [[carbapenem]]. Combination antibiotic therapy is often used in such situations. The treatment regimen is selected based on local resistance data and the susceptibility profile of the specific infecting organism(s).&lt;ref name=Gupta2011/&gt;

During the course of antibiotic treatment, serial white blood cell count and temperature are closely monitored. Typically, the intravenous antibiotics are continued until the person has no fever for at least 24 to 48&amp;nbsp;hours, then equivalent antibiotics by mouth can be given for a total of 2&amp;ndash;week duration of treatment.&lt;ref name=Starlin2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cabellon|first1=MCL|editor-last=Starlin|editor-first=R|title=The Washington Manual: Infectious Diseases Subspecialty Consult|edition=1st|chapter=Chapter 8: Urinary Tract Infections|pages=95–108|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7817-4373-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdabV2chPzMC&amp;lpg=PA105|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527045956/http://books.google.com/books?id=DdabV2chPzMC&amp;lpg=PA105|archivedate=2013-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intravenous fluids may be administered to compensate for the reduced oral intake, insensible losses (due to the raised temperature) and [[vasodilation]] and to optimize urine output. [[Percutaneous nephrostomy]] or ureteral stent placement may be indicated to relieve obstruction caused by a stone. Children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics ([[cefixime]], [[ceftibuten]] and [[Augmentin|amoxicillin/clavulanic acid]]) or with short courses (2 to 4&amp;nbsp;days) of intravenous therapy followed by oral therapy.&lt;ref name=Strohmeier2014&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Strohmeier Y, Hodson EM, Willis NS, Webster AC, Craig JC |title=Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=7|issue=|pages=CD003772|date=July 2014|pmid=25066627|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003772.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt; If intravenous therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective.&lt;ref name=Strohmeier2014/&gt;

Treatment of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis involves antibiotics as well as surgery. [[Nephrectomy|Removal of the kidney]] is the best surgical treatment in the overwhelming majority of cases, although polar resection (partial nephrectomy) has been effective for some people with localized disease.&lt;ref name=Korkes2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosi1986&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosi|first=P|author2=Selli C |author3=Carini M |author4=Rosi MF |author5=Mottola A |title=Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: clinical experience with 62 cases|journal=European Urology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=96–100|year=1986|pmid=3956552}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Watchful waiting]] with serial imaging may be appropriate in rare circumstances.&lt;ref name=Lebret2007&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lebret|first=T|author2=Poulain JE |author3=Molinie V |author4=Herve JM |author5=Denoux Y |author6=Guth A |author7=Scherrer A |author8=Botto H |title=Percutaneous core biopsy for renal masses: indications, accuracy and results|journal=The Journal of Urology|volume=178|issue=4 Pt 1|pages=1184–8|year=2007|pmid=17698122|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2007.05.155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
In people who experience recurrent urinary tract infections, additional investigations may identify an underlying abnormality. Occasionally, surgical intervention is necessary to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.

==Terminology==
The term is from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] πύελο|ς ''pýelo|s'', "basin" + νεφρ|ός ''nepʰrós'', "[[kidney]]" + suffix ''[[-itis]]'' suggesting "[[inflammation]]".

A similar term is "pyelitis" which means inflammation of the renal pelvis and calyces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=74268 medilexicon.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106031823/http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=74268 |date=2014-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Using Medical Terminology: A Practical Approach 2006 p.723&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, pyelitis together with nephritis is collectively known as pyelonephritis.

'''''Seven Dumpsters and a Corpse''''' is a documentary film (2007) by Swiss journalist {{Interlanguage link multi|Thomas Haemmerli|de}}.

== Synopsis ==
Thomas Haemmerli is about to celebrate his fortieth birthday when he learns of his mother's death. A further shock follows when he and his brother Erik discover her apartment, which is filthy and full to bursting with junk. It takes the brothers an entire month to clean out the place. Among the chaos, they find films going back to the 1930s, photos and other memorabilia.

Two opposing storylines developed out of the film material. On the one hand, there is the struggle against chaos, during which the apartment becomes increasingly empty and clean. On the other hand, there is the story of the family, which becomes increasingly confusing.

The film deals intensively with [[compulsive hoarding]].

== Background ==
Thomas Haemmerli is a Swiss TV journalist. On March 8, 2004, when he received the ominous phone call from Zurich's criminal police department which launched one of the most harrowing weeks of his life, Haemmerli reacted the way he was used to: he took out his camera and started shooting. It came out of 30 hours of DV footage which Haemmerli intended to turn into a short film ''"which we  might be able to show our friends"''.

::My brother and I had suspected the apartment would be in disorder. But what we found exceeded our worst expectations. Like most "Messies" my mother would do anything to make sure no one ever saw the inside of her home. It took us an entire month to clean out the apartment, and we had to work our way through mountains of things. We unearthed a lot of documents about our family history, including photos going back to the 1880s, film footage from the 30s and 40s, and all the home movies my mother shot from the 1960s onward. This precious material – roughly seventy years of an unusual family history – became the first impulse for making a film. And the possibility of filming in the apartment, without interference from relatives.&lt;ref name="Directors Statement"&gt;Thomas Haemmerli: ''[http://www.messiemother.com/2007/03/anmerkungen-des-regisseurs Director's Statement]''&lt;/ref&gt;
:::- Thomas Haemmerli, Director

::I detest films conceived as therapy for their maker. I believe films should be made to tell a story, not as self-help for the filmmaker.&lt;ref name="Directors Statement"/&gt;
:::- Thomas Haemmerli, Director

== Trivia ==
Young [[Kofi Annan]] makes an appearance in the documentary as he had been invited to the wedding of Haemmerli's parents.

Seven Dumpsters and a Corpse obtained a film subsidy of CHF 90'000 (about $75,000 USD) from Zurich's film foundation in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher Filmstiftung: ''[http://www.filmstiftung.ch/projects_archive.php?board=documentaries&amp;year=2006 Fachkommission Dokumentarfilm: alle unterstützten Projekte 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102184310/http://filmstiftung.ch/projects_archive.php?board=documentaries&amp;year=2006 |date=2007-11-02 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

== International release ==
The first release of ''Seven Dumpsters and a Corpse'' outside of Switzerland was at the [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]], April 2007, in [[Toronto]].

{{Use Indian English|date=March 2016}}
'''Sex education in India''' refers to the organised delivery by Indian governments and non-profits of material regarding sex, sexuality, and pregnancy. The three categories of sex education in India are (1) the [[sex education]] courses targeted at adolescents in school, (2) family planning for adults, and (3) HIV/AIDS Prevention Education. This article outlines the current state of, efficacy of, and opposition to these types of sex education in India. For history regarding family planning in India, see [[Family planning in India|Family Planning in India]].

==Current state of sexual health==

=== Sex and pregnancy ===
The sex ratio in India is skewed towards males, with 943 girls born per 1000 males in 2011. This is propagated by several factors, including lower caloric intake by mothers, female infanticide, and cultural preference for boys. However, the most plausible explanation for fewer female than male births is prenatal sex determination, followed by induced abortion of female fetuses.&lt;ref&gt;Jha, Prabhat, Rajesh Kumar, Priya Vasa, Neeraj Dhingra, Deva Thiruchelvam, and Rahim Moineddin. "Low male-to-female sex ratio of children born in India: national survey of 1· 1 million households." ''The Lancet'' 367, no. 9506 (2006): 211–218.
&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that potential mothers are socialised to believe that having a female child is detrimental to their family, either economically or socially.

In some areas of India, many young men and women are delaying their marriages to pursue their careers, a result of rising education levels. However, most Indian households are conservative and prohibit discussions about sex. In rural areas and urban slums, girls are often married early and they don't go into marriage equipped with any knowledge of sex. This manifests itself on a larger scale. According to [[UNICEF]], about 240 million women alive in India today were married before the age of 18&lt;ref name="ThirdChild-HT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/at-240-million-india-has-a-third-of-child-marriages-in-the-world/story-4VCQjqPRIfuxUBFSPs7xoJ.html|title=At 240 million, India has a third of child marriages in the world|date=12 August 2014|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the average age of women at first marriage has increased to 20.6.&lt;ref name="PushAge-DNA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-indian-women-push-back-marriage-age-1350166|title=Indian women push back marriage age|date=20 February 2010|work=[[DNA India]]`|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://remakeindia.in/sex-education-in-india/&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolescent fertility usually occurs within marriage because girls are encouraged to reproduce as early as they can after they are married. Therefore, 36% of children (aged 13–16) and 64% of adolescents (aged 17–19) are pregnant or already mothers.&lt;ref name="Jejeebhoy, Shireen J 1998"&gt;Jejeebhoy, Shireen J. "Adolescent sexual and reproductive behavior: a review of the evidence from India". ''Social Science &amp; Medicine'' 46, no. 10 (1998): 1275–1290.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, pregnancy outside of wedlock carries severe social stigma in India. [[Medical termination of pregnancy]] is available to few and the attitude of the providers towards such women is not amicable. As a result, they may attempt [[unsafe abortion]]s or abandon the child. Such stigmatised women may also commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Watsa2005"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2005|title=Sexual Health Services for Young People|url=http://medind.nic.in/jah/t04/s1/jaht04s1p36g.pdf|journal=Journal of Family Welfare|publisher=[[Family Planning Association of India]]|volume=50|issue=I|page=36|last1=Watsa|first1=M. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contraception is rarely used within or outside of marriage. Based on a National Family Health Survey conducted in 1992–1993, 7.1% of married women (aged 15–19) use contraception, compared to 21% among women (aged 20–24).&lt;ref name="Jejeebhoy, Shireen J 1998"/&gt; Additionally, adolescents lack access to contraceptive methods like oral contraceptives and diaphragms. Lack of contraception use is coupled with lack of availability of safe abortions. While five million abortions occur annually in India, only 10% of those are performed within the structures of a high-quality hospital.&lt;ref name="Jejeebhoy, Shireen J 1998"/&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS and other STIs ===
More than four million people are estimated to be infected with HIV in India – the highest proportion of any country in the world. Slightly more than one half are men, and almost one half are women.&lt;ref&gt;Newmann, S., P. Sarin, N. Kumarasamy, E. Amalraj, M. Rogers, P. Madhivanan, T. Flanigan et al. "Marriage, monogamy and HIV: a profile of HIV-infected women in south India." ''International journal of STD &amp; AIDS'' 11, no. 4 (2000): 250–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Premarital sex has risen in India, and a large proportion of it is unprotected. Additionally, married men often engage in risky behavior by having unprotected sex with multiple partners, which can include commercial sex workers. Finally, the cultural patriarchal structure in India makes it unlikely that women will be able to ensure that their husbands are monogamous (South et al.).&lt;ref&gt;South, S. J., Trent, K., &amp; Bose, S. (2012). INDIA’S “MISSING WOMEN” AND MEN’S SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIOR. ''Population Research and Policy Review'',''31''(6), 777–795. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-012-9248-3&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This makes young Indians vulnerable to [[teenage pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs) (Parwej et al.).&lt;ref name="Parwej2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Saroj Parwej|author2=Rajesh Kumar|author3=Indarjeet Walia|author4=Arun K. Aggarwal|title=Reproductive health education intervention trial|journal=The Indian Journal of Pediatrics|date=2005|volume=72|issue=4|pages=287–291|url=http://medind.nic.in/icb/t05/i4/icbt05i4p287.pdf|access-date=27 January 2016|doi=10.1007/bf02724005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that lower educated groups such as [[truck driver]]s are especially vulnerable to STDs due to lack of knowledge and prevalence of misconceptions.&lt;ref name="Cornman2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Deborah H Cornman|author2=Sarah J Schmiege|author3=T. Joseph Benziger|title=An Information-Motivation-Behavioral model-based HIV prevention intervention for truck drivers in India|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=2007|volume=64|issue=8|pages=1572–1584|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.11.011|pmc=4675654|pmid=17257724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of sex education ==

=== For adolescents ===
There are about 190 million adolescents in India - a demographic in which over 30% of people are illiterate. Disparities in gender at this age can often be explained by relatively poor access to reproductive health care and the fact that girls often have less access to food, which adversely affects their growth patterns. Additionally, adolescent girls often work long hours in the home with no opportunity for employment (Selvan et al.).&lt;ref name="Selvan, M. S. 2001"&gt;Selvan, M. S., M. W. Ross, A. S. Kapadia, R. Mathai, and S. Hira. "Study of perceived norms, beliefs and intended sexual behaviour among higher secondary school students in India." ''AIDS care'' 13, no. 6 (2001): 779-788.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolescents, both males and females, tend to not be informed about sexuality. This is often caused by lack of education in general (but sex education in particular) and conservative attitudes towards sex.&lt;ref name="Selvan, M. S. 2001"/&gt;

==== Efficacy ====
Parents are often reluctant to teach accurate and relevant information about sex to adolescents because of the stigma associated with the topic. More than taboo, mothers especially feel like talking about sex is embarrassing and dirty (Tripathi et al.).&lt;ref name="Tripathi, Niharika 2013"&gt;Tripathi, Niharika, and T. V. Sekher. "Youth in India ready for sex education? Emerging evidence from national surveys." ''PloS'' one 8, no. 8 (2013): e71584.&lt;/ref&gt;

This same attitude is held by teachers. First, when the National Council of Educational Research and Training initiated sex education, they structured it as a part of existing studies, rather than a separate subject. However, teachers tried to avoid teaching the topic. Second, a school in [[Gujarat]] implemented a system where students could anonymously drop letters into a box for trained counselors to read. The nature of these questions tended to split by sex. Girls' questions tended to focus on menstruation, physical appearance, and 'normal' sexual behavior while boys' questions tended to focus on nocturnal emission, masturbation and body size (Abraham et al.).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Though these programmes exist, they are unable to reach girls who are not school, a significant section of the population. Other than the specific initiatives outlined above, there are very few services that cater specifically to adolescents. Though NGOs and local schools are trying to push for more, teachers rarely cover issues like sexuality and reproductive health. Additionally, NGO reach is limited even though they can reach out-of-school adolescents (Tripathi et al.).&lt;ref name="Tripathi, Niharika 2013"/&gt;

In a 2005 study in [[Chandigarh]], a reproductive health education package was prepared after consulting parents and teachers to address cultural sensitivities. The package had a guidebook for the instructor and a book for the students for self-study. The students (aged 15–20; mean age was 16.47) were grouped and subjected to two types of education methods. In the first method, education was directly provided to them in a classroom setting by an instructor. In the second method, some students were selected and educated by instructors. Following that, they were encouraged to engage in [[peer education]]. A third group was reserved as a [[control group|control]]. The first group showed the most improvement in their knowledge after the nine-month programme. The peer-education group showed knowledge levels similar to the first group after a three-month course. The increase in knowledge level was considered significant after comparison to the control group.&lt;ref name="Parwej2005" /&gt;

Surveys have shown that adolescents learn a significant amount about sex from the media, including books and movies. However, exposure is not equivalent to accuracy. Though teens interacted with media that talked about sex, they did not glean accurate information regarding the reproductive process. Additionally, exposure to media didn't teach adolescents about healthy emotional growth or responsible adulthood.&lt;ref name="Tripathi, Niharika 2013"/&gt;

Finally, the level of awareness and knowledge regarding sex education among adolescents is higher among those living in urban areas than among those living in rural areas. This is caused by higher-quality education and more exposure to globalised points of view (Abraham).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Abraham, Leena, and K. Anil Kumar. "Sexual experiences and their correlates among college students in Mumbai City, India." ''International Family Planning Perspectives'' (1999): 139–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Opposition ====
There has been significant opposition to sex education, specifically for adolescents. In 2007, when sex education curriculum was promoted by India's Ministry of Human Resource Development, controversy developed. Many opponents believed that sex education would corrupt youth and be anathema to traditional Indian values. Additionally, they believed it would lead to promiscuity and irresponsible behavior. Finally, they argued that sex education was a western construct that was being forced upon India. These arguments cause states like [[Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Goa]] to ban sex education programming.&lt;ref name="Tripathi, Niharika 2013"/&gt;

In March 2007, the [[Maharashtra]] state government banned sex education in schools.&lt;ref name="MHSexEdBan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/maharashtra-resorts-to-another-ban/article1822059.ece|title=Maharashtra resorts to another ban|date=2 April 2007|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban came after the ruling and opposition [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] claimed that western countries had forced the Central government to implement the program.&lt;ref name="MahaCorrupts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/no-sex-education-please-it-corrupts-and-this-is-maharashtra/27130/0|title=No sex education please, it corrupts, and this is Maharashtra|date=31 March 2007|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007 Basavaraj Horatti, the [[Karnataka]] Minister for Primary and Secondary Education, said that the program has been put on hold after complaints from teachers. The teachers had complained that the books were oriented towards increasing the sales of condoms and that they were sexually provocative.&lt;ref name="KarSexEd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oneindia.com/2007/04/18/no-sex-education-in-karnataka-schools-now-minister-1176893759.html|title=No sex education in Karnataka schools now: Minister|date=18 April 2007|work=One India|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A women's organisation, Akhila Bharatha Mahila Samskruthika Sanghatane, also protested the course in the state.&lt;ref name="WomenOrg-TH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/womens-organisation-opposes-decision-to-introduce-sex-education-in-schools/article1807603.ece|title=Women's organisation opposes decision to introduce sex education in schools|date=8 March 2007|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2007, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]] removed [[sex education]] from the state curriculum on the grounds that it offended Indian values, acting on the advice of [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) [[ideologue]] [[Dinanath Batra]]. Batra suggested that [[yoga]] be added to the curriculum instead.&lt;ref name="sexed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/madhya-pradesh-bans-sex-education/25871/|title=Madhya Pradesh bans sex education|date=16 March 2007|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was criticised by S. Anandhi, a scholar of gender issues, who wrote that sex-education was vital for combatting [[child sexual abuse]] and the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]]. Later that year, Batra wrote a letter on behalf of the ''Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti'', which stated that teachers who followed the sex-education curriculum could be jailed for two years on the charge of "outraging the modesty of a woman."&lt;ref name="formerHRD"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-hrd-minister-feels-sex-education-corrupts-kids/article1-236673.aspx|title=Former HRD minister feels sex education corrupts kids|date=15 July 2007|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, [[Rajasthan]] Chief Minister [[Vasundhara Raje]] wrote a letter to [[Arjun Singh]], the Union Minister of Human Resource Development. In the letter, she stated that children in Class IX and XI did not require sex education because they were in the early stages of puberty. The state Education Minister Ghansyam Tiwari stated that they already had a life skills course called Jeevan Shaili which was sufficient.&lt;ref name="TooHotForVHP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/sex-education-course-too-hot-for-vhp-/29953/|title=Sex education course too hot for VHP|date=3 May 2007|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] Education Minister Bishnu Charan Das stated that they were delaying introduction of sex education by a year as a result of protests by teachers' organisations and students' political groups. Rajendra Burma of [[All India Democratic Students' Organisation]] (AIDSO) claimed that it would cause innocent students to become too curious about sex.&lt;ref name="Orissa-TOI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Orissa-govt-against-sex-education-in-schools/articleshow/2113029.cms|title=Orissa govt against sex education in schools|date=11 June 2007|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SexEd-TOI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Orissa-debates-sex-education-in-schools/articleshow/1976908.cms|title=Orissa debates sex education in schools|date=29 April 2007|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, a teachers' association protested the introduction of sex education in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. [[Om Prakash Sharma (Uttar Pradesh politician)|Om Prakash Sharma]], the chief of the association, said that it would result in embarrassing questions from students. He threatened to burn the books on a bonfire if they were not withdrawn.&lt;ref name="UPTeacher"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/no-sex-education-say-uttar-pradesh-teachers/story-8zi1Ru3B23jyNRih00zQqN.html|title=No sex education, say Uttar Pradesh teachers|date=9 July 2007|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ram Madhav]] of [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) called sex education unfit for Indian society. He instead proposed that workshops be held for adults only to warn them against a promiscuous lifestyle. [[Prakash Javadekar]] of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) proposed that sex education should consist of abstinence-only education. Another BJP leader [[Murli Manohar Joshi]] stated that the course would disturb the mental development of children and claimed that multinational companies were behind this to boost the sales of condoms.&lt;ref name="Trouble-BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6949714.stm|title=Sex education runs into trouble|date=22 August 2007|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 60 years Communist party and Congress Government refused to act on sex education.

Opponents of sex education for adolescents are swayed if sex education is deemed to be culturally sensitive and in line with Indian values. This can be achieved if the government and NGOs work in tandem to create curriculum that is acceptable to schools and the community. This trend may change as years progress because adolescents tend to have a more liberal view towards sex than adults.&lt;ref name="Tripathi, Niharika 2013" /&gt;

=== Family planning for adults ===
''See Also: [[Family planning in India|Family Planning in India]]''

Family planning in India has had a varied history. During [[The Emergency (India)|India's Emergency period]] in the 1970s, the government implemented a population-control policy which targeted lower-caste individuals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Connelly, Matthew. "Population control in India: Prologue to the emergency period." ''Population and Development Review'' 32, no. 4 (2006): 629-667.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the United States used food aid as leverage, India was incentivised to create a program that would influence lower-caste individuals to not have children. This program was eventually disbanded because of the lack of hygiene associated with the procedures and the nearly coercive techniques that were used (Connelly).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (see [[Family planning in India]])

India's family planning programmes are mainly run by the government in conjunction with NGOs. Because these programs are often quota-based, they take two forms: sterilisation programmes and contraceptive programmes (Gray et al.).&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Ronald H., Xianbin Li, Godfrey Kigozi, David Serwadda, Fred Nalugoda, Stephen Watya, Steven J. Reynolds, and Maria Wawer. "The impact of male circumcision on HIV incidence and cost per infection prevented: a stochastic simulation model from Rakai, Uganda." ''Aids'' 21, no. 7 (2007): 845-850.&lt;/ref&gt; Both use an incentive-based approach, where families are often given kitchen items or cash to undergo procedures (Bhatnagar et al.).&lt;ref&gt;Bhatnagar, R., K. Singh, T. Bir, U. Datta, S. Raj, and D. Nandan. "An assessment of performance based incentive system for ASHA Sahyogini in Udaipur, Rajasthan." ''Indian journal of public health'' 53, no. 3 (2008): 166-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Efficacy ====
The efficacy of India's family planning programs is dependent on the paradigm that is being used. Programs like Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) encourage women to register pregnancies and visit local health centres, and also encourage family planning through sterilisation. ASHA also  holds information meetings and raise awareness on such issues as women’s health, disease, social determinants of health, nutrition and sanitation. Additionally, they serve as counsellors on adolescent and female sexual and reproductive health (Scott).&lt;ref&gt;Scott, K., &amp; Shanker, S. (2010). Tying their hands? Institutional obstacles to the success of the ASHA community health worker programme in rural north India. ''AIDS Care'', ''22''(sup2), 1606-1612. doi:10.1080/09540121.2010.507751&lt;/ref&gt; Past hospital care, ASHA also gives out free birth control pills and condoms which remove the stigma associated with couples buying contraceptives at drug stores (Scott).&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Kerry, and Shobhit Shanker. "Tying their hands? Institutional obstacles to the success of the ASHA community health worker programme in rural north India." AIDS care 22, no. sup2 (2010): 1606-1612. Harvard&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Opposition ====
First, the most significant criticisms of India's family planning program are those that advocate that it should be education-based rather than quota-based. They argue that India's program isn't sustainable because it does not stop women from marrying early or from spacing their pregnancies. Second, critics state that India's program does not consider the psyche of women who often undergo irreversible procedures like sterilisation because it doesn't provide the infrastructure for regular follow-ups. Finally, critics state that the programme is inherently gendered because most sterilisations are performed on women even though the procedure is less invasive for men (Vicziany).&lt;ref&gt;Vicziany, M. (1982). Coercion in a Soft State: The Family-Planning Program of India: Part 2: The Sources of Coercion. ''Pacific Affairs,'' ''55''(4), 557-592. doi:1. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/2756842&lt;/nowiki&gt; doi:1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS and STD prevention education ===
[[File:Know Aids - No Aids.jpg|thumb|HIV/AIDS prevention sign]]
Because HIV/AIDS has been deemed a health crisis in India, prevention techniques have been set as a priority by the government which have been pushing NGOs to implement programming that focuses on training, support, and outreach.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Shrotri, A., A. V. Shankar, S. Sutar, A. Joshi, N. Suryawanshi, H. Pisal, K. E. Bharucha, M. A. Phadke, R. C. Bollinger, and J. Sastry. "Awareness of HIV/AIDS and household environment of pregnant women in Pune, India." ''International journal of STD &amp; AIDS'' 14, no. 12 (2003): 835-839.&lt;/ref&gt; HIV/AIDS prevention education in India has been focused on educational materials like newspapers and pamphlets as well as conversations with educated professionals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Efficacy ====
In a study conducted in Tamil Nadu, 29% of women and 58% of men attending an outpatient clinic were aware of AIDS/STDs, however only 12% of women and 26% of men attending an STD clinic were aware of AIDS. The conclusion from this study was that mass media had been more effective at disseminating information about HIV/AIDS than the radio. However, this study also showed that mothers were not knowledgeable about Mother-to-Infant transmission because the information hadn't filtered down to them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Additionally, a 2008 survey conducted among 11 and 12 class girls (aged 14 to 19; mean age was 16.38) in [[South Delhi]] found that 71% had no knowledge about the effects of [[genital herpes]]. 43% did not know the effects of [[syphilis]] and 28% did not know [[gonorrhoea]] was an STD. 46% thought the all STDs, except AIDS, could be cured. The major sources of information about STDs and safe sex among the girls were their friends (76%), media (72%), books and magazines (65%) or the internet (52%). 48% felt that they could not talk to their parents about sex.&lt;ref name="McManus2008"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2008|title=Study of knowledge, perception and attitude of adolescent girls towards STIs/HIV, safer sex and sex education: (A cross sectional survey of urban adolescent school girls in South Delhi, India)|url=http://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6874-8-12|journal=BMC Women's Health|volume=8|issue=1|page=12|doi=10.1186/1472-6874-8-12|author1=Alexandra McManus|author2=Lipi Dhar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Opposition ====
Opposition to HIV/AIDS prevention education in India has been scarce because of the recognition of the importance of stopping this disease. However, there has been a hesitance to acknowledge and interact with [[Men who have sex with men|men who have sex with men (MSM)]]. This has decreased the efficacy of programming because of the stigma associated with this population.&lt;ref&gt;Dandona, Lalit, Rakhi Dandona, Juan Pablo Gutierrez, G. Anil Kumar, Sam McPherson, Stefano M. Bertozzi, and Asci FPP Study Team. "Sex behaviour of men who have sex with men and risk of HIV in Andhra Pradesh, India." ''Aids'' 19, no. 6 (2005): 611-619.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy organisations and movements==

The [[Family Planning Association of India]] (FPAI) was established in 1949. It was formed with the aim to safeguard the health of women by preventing too many and too closely spaced pregnancies.&lt;ref name="VisariaVed2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leela Visaria|author2=Rajani R.

The Society for Nutrition, Education &amp; Health Action (SNEHA) was established in the 1990s and is located in [[Mumbai, India]]. From children's health all the way to [[sexual assault]] prevention, it works to promote awareness of women's autonomy, health, and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;More, Neena Shah, Ujwala Bapat, Sushmita Das, Glyn Alcock, Sarita Patil, Maya Porel, Leena Vaidya, Armida Fernandez, Wasundhara Joshi, and David Osrin.

Talking About Reproductive and Sexual Health Issues (TARSHI) was established in 1996 and is located in [[New Delhi, India]]. TARSHI works to expand sexual and reproductive choices by operating from an affirmative and rights based perspective - a perspective that is often antithetical to common cultural beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Dhingra, Nishu, and Yogesh C. Rotliwala. "THE ROLE OF NGOs IN REALIZING AND PROMOTING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN INDIA."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spiritual crisis''' (also called "'''spiritual emergency'''") is a form of [[identity crisis]] where an individual experiences drastic changes to their meaning system (i.e., their unique purposes, goals, values, attitude and beliefs, identity, and focus) typically because of a spontaneous [[spiritual experience]]. A spiritual crisis may cause significant disruption in psychological, social, and occupational functioning. Among the spiritual experiences thought to lead to episodes of spiritual crisis or spiritual emergency are psychiatric complications related to [[existential crisis]], [[mystical experience]], [[near-death experiences]], [[Kundalini syndrome]], [[paranormal]] experiences, [[religious ecstasy]], or other [[spirituality|spiritual]] practices.

==Background==
In general, before the mid-1970s mainstream [[psychiatry]] made no distinction between spiritual or mystical experiences and mental illness (GAP, 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;806). However, during the 1960s and 1970s, the overlap of spiritual/mystical experiences and mental health problems became of particular interest to counterculture critics of mainstream psychiatric practice who argued that experiences that fall outside of the norm may simply be another way of constructing reality and not necessarily a sign of mental disorder. The assumption of mainstream medical psychiatry was also challenged by critics from within the field of medical psychiatry itself. For example, [[R. D. Laing]] argued that mental health problems could also be a transcendental experience with healing and spiritual aspects. [[Arthur J. Deikman]] further suggested use of the term "[[mystical psychosis]]" to characterize first-person accounts of psychotic experiences that are conceptually similar to reports of mystical experiences.

Because of the gaining recognition of the overlap of spiritual/mystical experiences and mental health problems, in the early 1990s authors Lukoff, Lu, &amp; Turner (Turner et al., 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;435) made a proposal for a new diagnostic category entitled "Religious or Spiritual Problems". The category was approved by the DSM-IV Task Force in 1993 (Turner et al., 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;436) and is included in the fourth edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The inclusion marks increasing professional acceptance of spiritual issues in the assessment of mental health problems.

==Study==
The concept of "spiritual crisis" has mainly sprung from the work of [[transpersonal]] psychologists and psychiatrists whose view of the psyche stretches beyond that of Western psychology. Transpersonalists tend to focus less on [[psychopathology]] and more unidirectionally toward enlightenment and ideal [[mental health]] (Walsh &amp; Vaughan, 1993). However, this emphasis on spirituality's potentials and health benefits has been criticized. According to James (1902), a spiritual orientation focusing only on positive themes is arguably incomplete, as it fails to address evil and suffering ([[Kenneth Pargament|Pargament]] et al., 2004). Scholarly attention to spiritual struggle is therefore timely as it can provide greater balance to the empirical literature and increase understanding of everyday spirituality. Another reason for the study of spiritual crisis is that growth often occurs through suffering (e.g., Tedeschi, Park, &amp; Calhoun, 1998). As such, neglecting problems of suffering might result in neglecting vital sources of spiritual transformation and development (Paloutzian, 2005).

Both the terms "spiritual crisis" and "spiritual emergency" (Grof, 1989) share in the common recognition that: 
# non-ordinary experiences and psychological disturbances (e.g., [[anxiety]] and [[panic]]) often overlap; 
# Western medicine may have different, and therefore potentially conflicting, [[values]] among their patients about these experiences; 
# people need specialized support in their local area when in crisis.

==Neurological causes==
Spiritual crises, and spontaneous spiritual experiences, may have neurological causes, such as described in the [[Geschwind syndrome]] and in [[neurotheology]]. The Geschwind syndrome is a group of behavioral phenomena evident in some people with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]]. It is named for one of the first individuals to categorize the symptoms, [[Norman Geschwind]], who published prolifically on the topic from 1973 to 1984.&lt;ref name=DevinskySchachter2009&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.06.006| title = Norman Geschwind's contribution to the understanding of behavioral changes in temporal lobe epilepsy: The February 1974 lecture| journal = Epilepsy &amp; Behavior| volume = 15| issue = 4| pages = 417–24| year = 2009| last1 = Devinsky | first1 = J. | last2 = Schachter | first2 = S. | pmid = 19640791}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is controversy surrounding whether it is a true neuropsychiatric disorder.&lt;ref name=Benson1991&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 2003418| year = 1991| author1 = Benson| first1 = D.

'''Spray-and-vac cleaning''' is a “no-touch” method - [[cleaning]] is accomplished without the need for workers to touch soiled surfaces with their hands - used in professional cleaning in which a [[pressurized]], diluted [[Cleaning agent|cleaning solution]] is applied to soiled or contaminated surfaces. 

==Description==
To start, a diluted cleaning solution{{clarify|Describe typical ingredients|date=January 2017}} is sprayed onto all surfaces to be cleaned, Using the same machine, the area is then rinsed; this is typically followed by [[Vacuum cleaner|vacuum suctioning]] that removes the applied liquid along with the suspended solids and dissolved contaminants that have been removed from the surface.&lt;ref name="cemag"&gt;"Cleaning Methods for Ceramic Tile Floors," Controlled Environments magazine, April 2008, http://www.cemag.us/articles.asp?pid=744&lt;/ref&gt;

A key advantage of this method over traditional approaches is the ability to deep clean grouted areas (e.g. wall, counter and floor tile) preventing buildup of soil and bacteria in grout lines. Application of a cleaning solution followed by pressurized  rinsing and vacuuming removes soil more effectively than methods that rely solely on absorbent wiping (e.g. mopping, [[microfiber]] and cleaning cloth use).&lt;ref name="cemag"/&gt; In addition, studies published by the [[International Sanitary Supply Association]] (ISSA) have found that compared to legacy methods these systems potentially reduce cleaning times by 1/3 or more.&lt;ref&gt;Official 447 Cleaning Times, prepared by Management and published by [http://www.issa.com/ ISSA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike outdoor pressure washers with application pressures of 1,000 - [[Orders_of_magnitude_(pressure)|{{convert|5,000|psi}}]], spray-and-vac units are designed for long-term indoor use on grout and other surfaces, and offer variable application pressures ranging from 110 – {{convert|500|psi}}.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==History==
The first spray-and-vac system was developed by inventor Robert S. Robinson in 1997. A US Patent was issued in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Multi-functional cleaning machine Patent #6,206,980 http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=vq8FAAAAEBAJ&lt;/ref&gt; and the technology has since been licensed by other manufacturers of cleaning equipment.  A number of manufacturers in the [[cleaning industry]] now produce and market spray-and-vac systems or systems that are similar, and approximately 40,000-50,000 units have been sold worldwide&lt;ref&gt;Kaivac, http://www.kaivac.com, Tennant, http://www.tennantco.com/na-en/products/machines/750-all-surface-cleaner.aspx, Hydro, http://www.hydrosystemsco.com/new_ICS8800.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems are battery operated; others do not have vacuuming capabilities however they are still classified under this product category.

Spray-and-vac systems first became popular for [[restroom]] cleaning. However, over the years, users of the equipment have found a variety of uses for the equipment, including cleaning chairs and tables in [[cafeteria]]s, cleaning carpets and hard-surface flooring, and deep cleaning a variety of surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;"Emerging Trends In Hard Floor Care," CMM magazine, April 2009, http://www.cmmonline.com/article.asp?IndexID=6637023&lt;/ref&gt; 

An emerging market for spray-and-vac systems is public schools where the ability of the units to remove organic soils thoroughly, documented by [[Adenosine triphosphate|adenosine triphosphate (ATP)]] [[bioluminescence]] testing, is displacing traditional mop-and-bucket cleaning methods.&lt;ref&gt;"Measured Results," American School and University magazine, April 2009, http://asumag.com/Maintenance/integrated-cleaning-measurement-schools-200904/index1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Correctional and foodservice markets are also appropriate for this method since they typically feature grouted, ceramic tile floors.&lt;ref&gt;Corrections.com, March 2009, http://www.corrections.com/news/article/20959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Studies indicate there is not always a high degree of correlation between how clean a surface looks and the levels of contamination actually present. Spray-and-vac systems, are claimed to effectively remove embedded soils and contaminants as well as biological contaminants that are not visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;"Focus on Tile and Grout Cleaning,” Cleaning &amp; Maintenance Magazine, January 2008, http://www.cmmonline.com/articleprint.asp?print=1&amp;IndexID=6636722&lt;/ref&gt;  Such surfaces are typically referred to as “hygienically cleaned”.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Scientific evidence of this is provided through the use of technologies such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|adenosine triphosphate (ATP)]] [[bioluminescence]] rapid-monitoring systems. These systems indicate the presence of organic matter that may host harmful microorganisms on a variety of surfaces. In addition to detecting contaminants, ATP systems also provide “proof of service” that an area has been effectively and thoroughly cleaned. According to scientific studies{{cn|date=January 2017}} using ATP technology, spray-and-vac systems have been proven to remove more contaminants and disease-causing germs and [[bacteria]] on surfaces when compared to conventional mop, bucket, and cloth style cleaning.  Additionally, tests show that spray-and-vac systems do not spread contaminants from surface to surface, as can happen when using conventional cleaning methods.&lt;ref&gt;Cleaning Industry Research Institute (CIRI), May 2008, http://www.bsmmag.com/bsmmag/BSMArticle.asp?id=4427&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 2008, Before 9th Parliamentary Election of Bangladesh, Prime Leader of [[Bangladesh Awami League]] and nation's former [[Prime Minister]] [[Sheikh Hasina]] promised the people of [[Tangail District|Tangail]] to establish a Government financed medical school in [[Tangail]] city. As her party continued to rule as [[Government of Bangladesh]] for 2nd consecutive time in 2014, a decision was taken in August 2014 by the government to start Tangail Medical College alongside five other new medical colleges ([[Jamalpur Medical College]], [[Manikganj Medical College]], [[Shaheed M. Monsur Ali Medical College]], [[Patuakhali Medical College]], [[Rangamati Medical College]]). TMC is the 24th public medical college of [[Bangladesh]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1305">'''Temporary restoration''' is a temporary filling of [[tooth preparation|a prepared tooth]] until permanent restoration is carried out. It is used to cover the prepared part of the tooth, in order to maintain the occlusal space and the contact points, and insulation of the [[Pulp (tooth)|pulpal]] tissues and maintenance of the [[Periodontics|periodontal]] relationship. Sometimes permanent restoration is not done after tooth preparation; this may be to prepare for [[indirect restoration]] such as [[inlays and onlays]].
Temporary fillings are also used for 'stabilization' techniques where many restorations are needed, and the problem may become worse before it can be fully treated – so temporary fillings are placed in order to stop progression.

Temporary filling can last approximately one month. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.colgate.com/app/CP/US/EN/OC/Information/Articles/Oral-and-Dental-Health-Basics/Checkups-and-Dental-Procedures/Fillings/article/Fillings-the-Basics.cvsp&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mammal]]s, the '''vagina''' is the elastic, muscular part of the [[female genital tract]]. In humans, it extends from the [[vulva]] to the [[cervix]]. The outer vaginal opening is normally partly covered by a membrane called the [[hymen]]. At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the [[uterus]]) bulges into the vagina. The vagina allows for [[sexual intercourse]] and [[birth]].&lt;!-- NOTE: "Birth" instead of "childbirth." The article is not solely about humans. "Childbirth" is mentioned lower.--&gt;  It also channels [[Menstruation|menstrual flow]] (menses), which occurs in humans and closely related [[primate]]s as part of the monthly [[menstrual cycle]].
 
Although research on the vagina is especially lacking for different animals, its location, structure and size is documented as varying among species. Female mammals usually have two external openings in the vulva, the [[urethral]] opening for the [[urinary tract]] and the vaginal opening for the genital tract. This is different from male mammals, who usually have a single [[Urinary meatus|urethral opening]] for both [[urination]] and [[reproduction]]. The vaginal opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the [[labia]] in humans. In [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[monotreme]]s, the [[cloaca]] is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal tract, the urinary, and reproductive tracts.

To accommodate smoother penetration of the vagina during sexual intercourse or other [[sexual activity]], vaginal moisture increases during [[sexual arousal]] in human females and other female mammals. This increase in moisture provides [[vaginal lubrication]], which reduces friction. The texture of the vaginal walls creates friction for the [[penis]] during sexual intercourse and stimulates it toward [[ejaculation]], enabling [[fertilization]]. Along with pleasure and bonding, women's sexual behavior with others (which can include [[heterosexual]] or [[lesbian]] sexual activity) can result in [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), the risk of which can be reduced by recommended [[safe sex]] practices. [[#Infections, diseases, and safe sex|Other health issues]] may also affect the human vagina.

The vagina and [[vulva]] have evoked strong reactions in societies throughout history, including negative perceptions and language, cultural [[taboo]]s, and their use as symbols for [[female sexuality]], spirituality, or regeneration of life. [[Colloquialism|In common speech]], the word ''vagina'' is often used to refer to the vulva or to the female genitals in general. By its dictionary and anatomical definitions, however, ''vagina'' refers exclusively to the specific internal structure, and understanding the distinction can improve knowledge of the female genitalia and aid in healthcare communication.

==Etymology and definition==

The term ''vagina'' is from [[Latin]] meaning "sheath" or "[[scabbard]]"; the plural of ''vagina'' is either ''vaginae'', or ''vaginas''.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Stevenson A|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0199571123|year=2010|page=1962 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vagina may also be referred to as "the birth canal" in the context of [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name="Nevid"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Nevid J, Rathus S, Rubenstein H |title=Health in the New Millennium: The Smart Electronic Edition (S.E.E.)|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|isbn=978-1572591714|year=1998|page=297 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H65N8vmbgTYC&amp;pg=PA297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipsky"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Lipsky MS|title=American Medical Association Concise Medical Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Random House Reference]]|isbn=978-0375721809|year=2006|page=96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtZ_XdSymSIC&amp;pg=PA96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although by its dictionary and anatomical definitions, the term ''vagina'' refers exclusively to the specific internal structure, it is [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] used to refer to the [[vulva]] or to both the vagina and vulva.&lt;ref name="Dalton"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Dalton M|title=Forensic Gynaecology|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-1107064294|year=2014|page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kr6ZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Jones T, Wear D, Friedman LD |title=Health Humanities Reader|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0813573670|year=2014|pages=231–232 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqRvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the term ''vagina'' to mean "vulva" can pose medical or legal confusion; for example, a person's interpretation of its location might not match another's interpretation of the location.&lt;ref name="Dalton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Kirkpatrick M|title=Human Sexuality: Personality and Social Psychological Perspectives|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|isbn=978-1468436563|year=2012|page=175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfsxBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medically, the vagina is the canal between the [[hymen]] (or remnants of the hymen) and the [[cervix]], while, legally, it begins at the vulva (between the [[labia]]).&lt;ref name="Dalton"/&gt; It may be that the incorrect use of the term ''vagina'' is due to not as much thought going into the anatomy of the female genitals as has gone into the study of male genitals, and that this has contributed to an absence of correct vocabulary for the external female genitalia among both the general public and health professionals. Because of this and because a better understanding of female genitalia can help combat sexual and psychological harm with regard to female development, researchers endorse correct terminology for the vulva.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Hill CA|title=Human Sexuality: Personality and Social Psychological Perspectives|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=978-1506320120|year=2007|pages=265–266 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUJsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA266|quote=Little thought apparently has been devoted to the nature of female genitals in general, likely accounting for the reason that most people use incorrect terms when referring to female external genitals. The term typically used to talk about female genitals is ''vagina'', which is actually an internal sexual structure, the muscular passageway leading outside from the uterus. The correct term for the female external genitals is ''vulva'', as discussed in chapter 6, which includes the clitoris, labia majora, and labia minora.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sáenz-Herrero"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Sáenz-Herrero M|title=Psychopathology in Women: Incorporating Gender Perspective into Descriptive Psychopathology|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=978-3319058702|year=2014|page=250 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-unSBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250|quote=In addition, there is a current lack of appropriate vocabulary to refer to the external female genitals, using, for example, 'vagina' and 'vulva' as if they were synonyms, as if using these terms incorrectly were harmless to the sexual and psychological development of women.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not [[sexually aroused]], the vagina is a collapsed tube, with the front and back walls placed together. The lateral walls, especially their middle area, are relatively more rigid.

====Vaginal opening and hymen====
The vaginal opening is at the posterior end of the [[vulval vestibule]], behind the [[urinary meatus|urethral opening]]. The opening to the vagina is normally obscured by the [[labia minora]] (vaginal lips), but may be exposed after [[vaginal delivery]].&lt;ref name="Dutta"/&gt;

====Variations and size====
{{Main|Human vaginal size}}
The length of the vagina [[anatomical variation|varies]] among women of child-bearing age. Because of the presence of the cervix in the front wall of the vagina, there is a difference in length between the front wall, approximately 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm (2.5 to 3 in) long, and the back wall, approximately 9&amp;nbsp;cm (3.5&amp;nbsp;in) long.&lt;ref name="Dutta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wylie"/&gt;  During sexual arousal, the vagina expands both in length and width. If a woman stands upright, the vaginal canal points in an upward-backward direction and forms an angle of approximately 45 degrees with the uterus.&lt;ref name="Dutta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsevier Obstetrics"/&gt; The vaginal opening and hymen also vary in size; in children, although the hymen commonly appears [[crescent]]-shaped, many shapes are possible.&lt;ref name="Dutta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Emans"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Emans SJ |chapter=Physical Examination of the Child and Adolescent |title=Evaluation of the Sexually Abused Child: A Medical Textbook and Photographic Atlas |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=61–65|isbn=978-0199747825|date=2000|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eQZhs4PwrYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===

The vaginal plate is the precursor to the vagina.&lt;ref name="Edmonds" /&gt; During development, the vaginal plate begins to grow where the fused ends of the [[paramesonephric duct]]s (Müllerian ducts) enter the back wall of the [[urogenital sinus]] as the [[sinus tubercle]]. As the plate grows, it significantly separates the cervix and the urogenital sinus; eventually, the central cells of the plate break down to form the vaginal [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].&lt;ref name="Edmonds"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Edmonds K |title=Dewhurst's Textbook of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-0470654576|year=2012|page=423 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfakBRceodcC&amp;pg=PA423}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usually occurs by the twenty to twenty-fourth week of development. If the lumen does not form, or is incomplete, membranes known as [[vaginal septum|vaginal septae]] can form across or around the tract, causing obstruction of the outflow tract later in life.&lt;ref name="Edmonds"/&gt;

During [[sexual differentiation in humans|sexual differentiation]], without [[testosterone]], the urogenital sinus persists as [[Vulval vestibule|the vestibule]] of the vagina. The two [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|urogenital folds]]  of the [[genital tubercle]] form the [[labia minora]], and the [[labioscrotal swelling]]s enlarge to form the [[labia majora]].&lt;ref name="Merz and Bahlmann"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Merz E, Bahlmann F |title=Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=1 |publisher=[[Thieme Medical Publishers]] |year=2004|page=129|isbn=978-1-58890-147-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuenke"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Schuenke M, Schulte E, Schumacher U |title=General Anatomy and Musculoskeletal System |publisher=[[Thieme Medical Publishers]] |isbn=978-1-60406-287-8|year=2010|page=192 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NK9TgTaGt6UC&amp;pg=PA192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are conflicting views on the embryologic origin of the vagina.

===Microanatomy===
{{Main|Vaginal epithelium}}
[[File:Vagina (mucosa).JPG|thumb|alt=Micrograph of vaginal wall|Medium-power magnification [[micrograph]] of a [[H&amp;E stain]]ed slide showing a portion of a vaginal wall. [[Stratified squamous epithelium]] and underling connective tissue can be seen. The deeper muscular layers are not shown. The black line points to a fold in the mucosa.]]
The vaginal wall from the lumen outwards consists firstly of a [[mucosa]] of [[stratified squamous epithelium]] that is not [[Stratified squamous epithelium#Keratinized|keratinized]], with a [[lamina propria]] (a thin layer of [[connective tissue]]) underneath it. Secondly, there is a layer of [[smooth muscle]] with bundles of circular fibers internal to longitudinal fibers (those that run lengthwise). Lastly, is an outer layer of connective tissue called the [[adventitia]]. Some texts list four layers by counting the two sublayers of the mucosa (epithelium and lamina propria) separately.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Brown L |title=Pathology of the Vulva and Vagina |year=2012|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|isbn=978-0857297570|pages=6–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yv2CMHoVR9wC&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arulkumaran"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Arulkumaran S, Regan L, Papageorghiou A, Monga A, Farquharson D |title=Oxford Desk Reference: Obstetrics and Gynaecology |year=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0191620874|page=471|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRaWcRYx_7YC&amp;pg=PA471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smooth [[muscular layer]] within the vagina has a weak contractive force that can create some pressure in the lumen of the vagina; much stronger contractive force, such as during childbirth, comes from muscles in the [[pelvic floor]] that are attached to the adventitia around the vagina.&lt;ref name=Bitzer&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Bitzer J, Lipshultz L, Pastuszak A, Goldstein A, Giraldi A, Perelman M |title=Management of Sexual Dysfunction in Men and Women |date=2016 |publisher=Springer New York |isbn=9781493930999 |page=202 |language=en |chapter=The Female Sexual Response: Anatomy and Physiology of Sexual Desire, Arousal, and Orgasm in Women|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-3100-2_18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lamina propria is rich in blood vessels and lymphatic channels. The muscular layer is composed of smooth muscle fibers, with an outer layer of longitudinal muscle, an inner layer of circular muscle, and oblique muscle fibers between. The outer layer, the adventitia, is a thin dense layer of connective tissue and it blends with loose connective tissue containing blood vessels, [[lymphatic vessel]]s and nerve fibers that are between pelvic organs.&lt;ref name="Mulhall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arulkumaran" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wylie"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Wylie L |title=Essential Anatomy and Physiology in Maternity Care |year=2005|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-443-10041-3|pages=157–158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QgpOvSDxGGYC&amp;pg=PA157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaginal mucosa is absent of glands. It forms folds (transverse ridges or [[rugae]]), which are more prominent in the outer third of the vagina; their function is to provide the vagina with increased surface area for extension and stretching.&lt;ref name="Snell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutta"/&gt;

Flattened squamous cells are more resistant to both abrasion and infection.&lt;ref name="G and H"/&gt; The permeability of the epithelium allows for an effective response from the [[immune system]] since [[antibodies]] and other immune components can easily reach the surface.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Anderson DJ, Marathe J, Pudney J |date=June 2014 |title=The Structure of the Human Vaginal Stratum Corneum and its Role in Immune Defense |journal=American Journal of Reproductive Immunology|language=en|volume=71|issue=6|pages=618–623|doi=10.1111/aji.12230|pmid=24661416 |issn=1600-0897|pmc=4024347}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaginal epithelium differs from the similar tissue of the skin. The [[epidermis]] of the skin is relatively resistant to water because it contains high levels of lipids. The vaginal epithelium contains lower levels of lipids. This allows the passage of water and water-soluble substances through the tissue.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;

Keratinization happens when the epithelium is exposed to the dry external atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Dutta"/&gt; In abnormal circumstances, such as in [[Female genital prolapse|pelvic organ prolapse]], the mucosa may be exposed to air, becoming dry and keratinized.&lt;ref name="Dutta2"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Dutta DC |title=DC Dutta's Textbook of Gynecology |year=2014|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=978-9351520689|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40yVAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main veins drain blood from the vagina, one on the left and one on the right. These form a network of smaller veins, the [[vaginal venous plexus]], on the sides of the vagina, connecting with similar venous plexuses of the [[uterine venous plexus|uterus]], [[vesical venous plexus|bladder]], and [[rectal venous plexus|rectum]]. These ultimately drain into the [[internal iliac vein]]s.&lt;ref name=GRAYS2008 /&gt;

Most women require direct stimulation of the [[clitoris]] to orgasm.&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; The clitoris plays a part in vaginal stimulation. It is a sex organ of multiplanar structure containing an abundance of nerve endings, with a broad attachment to the pubic arch and extensive supporting tissue to the labia. Research indicates that it forms a tissue cluster with the vagina. This tissue is perhaps more extensive in some women than in others, which may contribute to orgasms experienced vaginally.&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Connell"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connell HE, Sanjeevan KV, Hutson JM |title=Anatomy of the clitoris |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=174 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=1189–95 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16145367 |laysummary= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/5013866.stm |laysource=Time for rethink on the clitoris, [[BBC News]] |laydate=June 11, 2006 |doi=10.1097/01.ju.0000173639.38898.cd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is the Female G-Spot Truly a Distinct Anatomic Entity?|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|volume= 9|date=January 2012 |pmid=22240236|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02623.x|laysummary=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/19/g-spot-does-not-exist_n_1215822.html|laysource=G-Spot Does Not Exist, 'Without A Doubt,' Say Researchers - ''[[The Huffington Post]]''|laydate=January 19, 2012 |vauthors=Kilchevsky A, Vardi Y, Lowenstein L, Gruenwald I |issue=3|pages=719–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During sexual arousal, and particularly the stimulation of the clitoris, the walls of the vagina lubricate. This begins after ten to thirty seconds of sexual arousal, and increases in amount the longer the woman is aroused.&lt;ref name="Heffner"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Heffner LJ, Schust DJ |title=The Reproductive System at a Glance|page=39|isbn=978-1118607015|date=2014|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JuvcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reduces friction or injury that can be caused by insertion of the penis into the vagina or other penetration of the vagina during sexual activity.

An area in the vagina that may be an [[erogenous zone]] is the [[G-spot]]. It is typically defined as being located at the anterior wall of the vagina, a couple or few inches in from the entrance, and some women experience intense pleasure, and sometimes an orgasm, if this area is stimulated during sexual activity.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bullough"/&gt; A G-spot orgasm may be responsible for [[female ejaculation]], leading some doctors and researchers to believe that G-spot pleasure comes from the [[Skene's gland]]s, a female [[Homology (biology)|homologue]] of the [[prostate]], rather than any particular spot on the vaginal wall; other researchers consider the connection between the Skene's glands and the G-spot area to be weak.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bullough"/&gt; The G-spot's existence (and existence as a distinct structure) is still under dispute because reports of its location can vary from woman to woman, it appears to be nonexistent in some women, and it is hypothesized to be an extension of the clitoris and therefore the reason for orgasms experienced vaginally.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balon, Segraves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"/&gt;

=== Childbirth ===
{{Main|Childbirth}}
The vagina is the birth canal for the [[childbirth|delivery]] of a baby. When labor (a physiological process preceding delivery) nears, several signs may occur, including vaginal discharge, and the [[rupture of membranes]] (water breaking) that can result in a gush of [[amniotic fluid]]&lt;ref name="Orshan"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Orshan SA |title=Maternity, Newborn, and Women's Health Nursing: Comprehensive Care Across the Lifespan|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|isbn=978-0781742542|year=2008|pages=585–586 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91dAzl2J_LgC&amp;pg=PA585}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an irregular or small stream of fluid from the vagina.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Evans JM, Aronson R |title=The Whole Pregnancy Handbook: An Obstetrician's Guide to Integrating Conventional and Alternative Medicine Before, During, and After Pregnancy|publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|isbn=978-1592401116|year=2005|pages=435–436 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qj3VmuHvsOgC&amp;pg=PA435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norsigian"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=((Boston Women's Health Book Collective)) |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves: Pregnancy and Birth|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=978-1416565918|year=2008|pages=172–174 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzHZlM9fha4C&amp;pg=PA172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water breaking most commonly happens during labor; however, it can occur before labor (known as premature rupture of membranes) and this happens in 10% of cases.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Callahan"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Callahan T, Caughey AB|title=Blueprints Obstetrics and Gynecology|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|isbn=978-1451117028|year=2013|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKC1B3BhlxUC&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Braxton Hicks contractions]] are also a sign of nearing labor, but not all women notice them.&lt;ref name="Orshan" /&gt; Among women giving birth for the first time, Braxton Hicks contractions are mistaken for actual [[Uterine contraction#Childbirth|contractions]], and are usually very strong in the days leading up to labor.&lt;ref name="Pillitteri"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Pillitteri A|title=Maternal and Child Health Nursing: Care of the Childbearing and Childrearing Family|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|isbn=978-1469833224|year=2013|page=298|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=26idAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the body prepares for childbirth, the cervix softens, [[Cervical effacement|thins]], moves forward to face the front, and begins to open. This allows the fetus to settle or "drop" into the pelvis.&lt;ref name="Orshan"/&gt; As the fetus settles into the pelvis, pain from the [[sciatic nerve]]s, increased vaginal discharge, and increased urinary frequency can occur. While these symptoms are likelier to happen after labor has begun for women who have given birth before, they may happen ten to fourteen days before labor in women experiencing labor for the first time.&lt;ref name="Orshan"/&gt;

The fetus begins to lose the support of the cervix when contractions begin. With [[cervical dilation]] reaching a diameter of more than {{convert|10|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} to accommodate the head of the fetus, the head moves from the uterus to the vagina.&lt;ref name="Orshan"/&gt; The elasticity of the vagina allows it to stretch to many times its normal diameter in order to deliver the child.&lt;ref name="Wylie" /&gt;

Vaginal births are more common, but if there is a risk of complications a [[caesarean section]] (C-section) may be performed.&lt;ref name=NIH&gt;{{cite web|title=Pregnancy Labor and Birth|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/childbirth-and-beyond/labor-and-birth|publisher=Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|access-date=July 15, 2017|date=February 1, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728021055/https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/childbirth-and-beyond/labor-and-birth|archive-date=July 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaginal mucosa has an abnormal accumulation of fluid ([[edematous]]) and is thin, with few rugae, a little after birth. The mucosa thickens and rugae return in approximately three weeks once the ovaries regain usual function and estrogen flow is restored. The vaginal opening gapes and is relaxed, until it returns to its approximate pre-pregnant state six to eight weeks after delivery, known as the [[postpartum period]]; however, the vagina will continue to be larger in size than it was previously.&lt;ref name="Ricci"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ricci SS, Kyle T |title=Maternity and Pediatric Nursing|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|isbn=978-0781780551|year=2009|pages=431–432 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gaYtFuND7VIC&amp;pg=PA431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After giving birth, there is a phase of vaginal discharge called [[lochia]] that can vary significantly in the amount of loss and its duration but can go on for up to six weeks.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fletcher, S, Grotegut, CA, James, AH |title=Lochia patterns among normal women: a systematic review.|journal=Journal of Women's Health (2002) |date=December 2012 |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=1290–4 |doi=10.1089/jwh.2012.3668 |pmid=23101487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medications===
[[Intravaginal administration]] is a [[route of administration]] where the medication is inserted into the vagina as a creme or tablet. [[Pharmacological]]ly, this has the potential advantage of promoting [[therapeutic effect]]s primarily in the vagina or nearby structures (such as the [[vaginal portion of cervix]]) with limited systemic [[adverse effect]]s compared to other routes of administration.&lt;ref name="Ranade"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ranade VV, Cannon JB |title=Drug Delivery Systems |edition=3rd |publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-1439806180|year=2011|page=337 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBfLKBTQk0cC&amp;pg=PA337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehne"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Lehne RA, Rosenthal L |title=Pharmacology for Nursing Care|publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]]|isbn=978-0323293549|year=2014|page=1146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udTsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medications used to ripen the cervix and induce labor are commonly administered via this route, as are estrogens, contraceptive agents, [[propranolol]], and [[antifungal medication|antifungal]]s.

Before the baby merges from the womb, an injection for pain control during childbirth may be administered through the vaginal wall and near the [[pudendal nerve]]. Because the pudendal nerve carries motor and sensory fibers that innervate the pelvic muscles, a [[Pudendal nerve#Anesthesia|pudendal nerve block]] relieves birth pain. The medicine does not harm the child, and is without significant complications.&lt;ref name="Maclean2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gynaecology |vauthors=Maclean A, Reid W |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7020-3120-5|veditors=Shaw R |location=Edinburgh New York|pages=599–612|chapter=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vaginal lymph nodes often trap [[cancer]]ous cells that originate in the vagina. These nodes can be assessed for the presence of disease. Selective surgical removal (rather than total and more invasive removal) of vaginal lymph nodes reduces the risk of complications that can accompany more radical surgeries. These selective nodes act as sentinel lymph nodes.&lt;ref name="Sabater"/&gt; Instead of surgery, the lymph nodes of concern are sometimes treated with [[radiation therapy]] administered to the patient's pelvic, inguinal lymph nodes, or both.&lt;ref name = NIHI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/vaginal/hp/vaginal-treatment-pdq#section/_45 |publisher=National Institutes of Health |website=National Cancer Institute |date=February 9, 2017 |title=Stage I Vaginal Cancer |access-date=December 14, 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the third stage of labor, while the infant is being born, the vagina undergoes significant changes. A gush of blood from the vagina may be seen right before the baby is born.

The vagina, including the vaginal opening, may be altered as a result of surgeries such as an episiotomy, [[vaginectomy]], [[vaginoplasty]] or [[labiaplasty]].&lt;ref name="Siemionow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tabers&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Venes D|title=Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary|publisher=F.A.

Any scarring from the procedure is minimal, and long-term problems have not been identified.&lt;ref name="Siemionow"/&gt;

During an episiotomy, a surgical incision is made during the second stage of labor to enlarge the vaginal opening for the baby to pass through.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although its routine use is no longer recommended,&lt;ref name=ACOG165&gt;{{cite journal|title=Practice Bulletin No. 165: Prevention and Management of Obstetric Lacerations at Vaginal Delivery.|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=July 2016|volume=128|issue=1|pages=e1–e15|pmid=27333357|doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000001523|author1=American College of Obstetricians Gynecologists' Committee on Practice Bulletins—Obstetrics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not having an episiotomy is found to have better results than an episiotomy,&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; it is one of the most common medical procedures performed on women.

Surgery on the vagina can be elective or cosmetic. Women who seek cosmetic surgery can have [[congenital]] conditions, physical discomfort or wish to alter the appearance of their genitals.

Various perceptions of the vagina have existed throughout history, including the belief it is the center of [[sexual desire]], a metaphor for life via birth, inferior to the penis, unappealing to sight or smell, or [[vulgarity|vulgar]].&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stone L |title=New Directions in Anthropological Kinship|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|page=164|isbn=978-0585384245 |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uaKaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutcherson"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Hutcherson H |title=What Your Mother Never Told You about Sex|publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|page=8|isbn=978-0399528538 |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xu8tb2o66iIC&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaFont"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=LaFont S |title=Constructing Sexualities: Readings in Sexuality, Gender, and Culture|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|page=145|isbn=978-0130096616 |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dtftAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views can largely be attributed to [[Sex differences in humans|sex differences]], and how they are interpreted. [[David Buss]], an [[evolutionary psychologist]], stated that because a penis is significantly larger than a clitoris and is readily visible while the vagina is not, and males urinate through the penis, boys are taught from childhood to touch their penises while girls are often taught that they should not touch their own genitalia, which implies that there is harm in doing so. Buss attributed this as the reason many women are not as familiar with their genitalia, and that researchers assume these sex differences explain why boys learn to masturbate before girls and do so more often.&lt;ref name="Buss"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Buss DM, Meston CM |title=Why Women Have Sex: Understanding Sexual Motivations from Adventure to Revenge (and Everything in Between) |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|page=33|isbn=978-1429955225 |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slyflT85lXIC&amp;pg=PA33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She argued that women, unlike men, did not have locker room experiences in school where they compared each other's genitals, which is one reason so many women wonder if their genitals are normal.&lt;ref name="Hutcherson"/&gt; Scholar Catherine Blackledge stated that having a vagina meant she would typically be treated less well than her vagina-less counterparts and subject to inequalities (such as [[job inequality]]), which she categorized as being treated like a second-class citizen.&lt;ref name="Blackledge"/&gt;

While, in ancient times, the vagina was often considered equivalent ([[Homology (biology)|homologous]]) to the penis, with anatomists [[Galen]] (129 AD&amp;nbsp;– 200 AD) and [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]] (1514–1564) regarding the organs as structurally the same except for the vagina being inverted, anatomical studies over latter centuries showed the clitoris to be the penile equivalent.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Angier"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=[[Natalie Angier|Angier N]] |title=Woman: An Intimate Geography |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|page=92|isbn=978-0-395-69130-4 |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NIonAf-m9OwC&amp;pg=PA92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another perception of the vagina was that the release of vaginal fluids would cure or remedy a number of ailments; various methods were used over the centuries to release "female seed" (via vaginal lubrication or female ejaculation) as a treatment for {{lang|la|suffocatio ex semine retento}} (suffocation of the womb, {{literal translation|lk=on}}&amp;nbsp;'suffocation from retained seed'), [[green sickness]], and possibly for [[female hysteria]]. Reported methods for treatment included a [[midwife]] rubbing the walls of the vagina or insertion of the penis or penis-shaped objects into the vagina. Symptoms of the female hysteria diagnosis&amp;nbsp;– a concept that is no longer recognized by medical authorities as a medical disorder&amp;nbsp;– included faintness, nervousness, insomnia, fluid retention, heaviness in abdomen, muscle spasm, shortness of breath, irritability, loss of appetite for food or sex, and a propensity for causing trouble.&lt;ref name=Maines&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Maines RP |title=The Technology of Orgasm: "Hysteria", the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=1998|pages=1–188|isbn=978-0-8018-6646-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNKw0XuaSxoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that women who were considered suffering from female hysteria condition would sometimes undergo "pelvic massage"&amp;nbsp;– stimulation of the genitals by the doctor until the woman experienced "hysterical paroxysm" (i.e., orgasm).

The ''[[vagina loquens]]'', or "talking vagina", is a significant tradition in literature and art, dating back to the ancient [[folklore]] [[Motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] of the "talking cunt".&lt;ref name=ozark&gt;{{cite book|title=Unprintable Ozark Folksongs and Folklore: Blow the candle out|publisher=[[University of Arkansas Press]]|vauthors=Randolph V, Legman G |year=1992|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S93LdPw2KP0C|isbn=978-1557282378|pages=819–820}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zizek&gt;{{cite book|title=Organs without bodies: Deleuze and consequences|publisher=[[Routledge]]|vauthors=Zizek S |year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Pp6-1yQbgmgC|isbn=978-0415969215|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tales usually involve vaginas talking due to the effect of magic or charms, and often admitting to their lack of [[chastity]].&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt; Other folk tales relate the vagina as having teeth – ''[[vagina dentata]]'' ([[Latin]] for "toothed vagina"). These carry the implication that sexual intercourse might result in injury, [[emasculation]], or [[castration]] for the man involved. These stories were frequently told as [[cautionary tale]]s warning of the dangers of unknown women and to discourage [[rape]].&lt;ref name=WhatsUp&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-312-64436-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ybaNhKqGmwC&amp;pg=PA59 |title=What's Up Down There?: Questions You'd Only Ask Your Gynecologist If She Was Your Best Friend |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |date=2010 |page=59 |vauthors=Rankin L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the French artist [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] collaborated with [[Dadaist]] artist [[Jean Tinguely]] and Per Olof Ultvedt on a large sculpture installation entitled {{lang|sv|"hon-en katedral"|italic=unset}} (also spelled {{lang|sv|"Hon-en-Katedrall"|italic=unset}}, which means "she-a cathedral") for Moderna Museet, in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The outer form is a giant, reclining sculpture of a woman which visitors can enter through a door-sized vaginal opening between her spread legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life &amp; Work|publisher=nikidesaintphalle.org|date=2017|access-date=November 8, 2014|url=http://nikidesaintphalle.org/niki-de-saint-phalle/biography/#1965-1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', a 1996 episodic play by [[Eve Ensler]], has contributed to making female sexuality a topic of public discourse. It is made up of a varying number of monologues read by a number of women. Initially, Ensler performed every monologue herself, with subsequent performances featuring three actresses; latter versions feature a different actress for every role. Each of the monologues deals with an aspect of the [[Femininity|feminine experience]], touching on matters such as sexual activity, love, rape, menstruation, female genital mutilation, masturbation, birth, orgasm, the various common names for the vagina, or simply as a physical aspect of the body. A recurring theme throughout the pieces is the vagina as a tool of female empowerment, and the ultimate embodiment of individuality.&lt;ref name="Ensler"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=[[Eve Ensler|Ensler E]] |title=The Vagina Monologues: The V-Day Edition |publisher=[[Random House|Random House LLC]] |isbn=978-0375506581|year=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=G74c4i2SUmAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Coleman C |title=Coming to Read "The Vagina Monologues": A Biomythographical Unravelling of the Narrative |publisher=[[University of New Brunswick]] |isbn=978-0494466551|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on modification===
{{See also|Genital modification and mutilation}}
Societal views, influenced by tradition, a lack of knowledge on anatomy, or [[sexism]], can significantly impact a person's decision to alter their own or another person's genitalia.&lt;ref name="Cardozo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knox"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Knox D, Schacht C|title=Choices in Relationships: Introduction to Marriage and the Family|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-0495091851|year=2007|pages=60–61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3XD0VEYGSUC&amp;pg=PA60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women may want to alter their genitalia (vagina or vulva) because they believe that its appearance, such as the length of the labia minora covering the vaginal opening, is not normal, or because they desire a smaller vaginal opening or tighter vagina. Women may want to remain youthful in appearance and sexual function. These views are often influenced by the media,&lt;ref name="Cardozo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banyard"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Banyard K|title=The Equality Illusion: The Truth about Women and Men Today|publisher=[[Faber &amp; Faber]]|isbn=978-0571258666|year=2010|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eo046KrxKOYC&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[pornography]],&lt;ref name="Banyard"/&gt; and women can have low self-esteem as a result.&lt;ref name="Cardozo"/&gt; They may be embarrassed to be naked in front of a sexual partner and may insist on having sex with the lights off.&lt;ref name="Cardozo"/&gt; When modification surgery is performed purely for cosmetic reasons, it is often viewed poorly,&lt;ref name="Cardozo"/&gt; and some doctors have compared such surgeries to [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref name="Banyard"/&gt;

Female genital mutilation, also known as female circumcision or female genital cutting, is genital modification with no health benefits.&lt;ref name="Crooks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Female genital mutilation |website=Media centre |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |access-date=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most severe form is Type III FGM, which is [[infibulation]] and involves removing all or part of the [[labia]] and the vagina being closed up. A small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, and the vagina is opened up for sexual intercourse and childbirth.&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"/&gt;

Significant controversy surrounds female genital mutilation,&lt;ref name="Crooks"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Crooks R, Baur K |title=Our Sexuality |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |year=2010 |pages=55–56 |isbn=978-0-495-81294-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"/&gt; with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and other health organizations campaigning against the procedures on behalf of [[human rights]], stating that it is "a violation of the human rights of girls and women" and "reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes".&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"/&gt; Female genital mutilation has existed at one point or another in almost all human civilizations,&lt;ref name="Momoh" /&gt; most commonly to exert control over the sexual behavior, including masturbation, of girls and women.&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Momoh"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=[[Comfort Momoh|Momoh C]] |chapter=Female Genital Mutation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&amp;pg=PA5 |title=Female Genital Mutilation |veditors=Momoh C |pages=5–12 |publisher=Radcliffe Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-85775-693-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is carried out in several countries, especially in [[Africa]], and to a lesser extent in other parts of the [[Middle East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], on girls from a few days old to mid-adolescent, often to reduce sexual desire in an effort to preserve vaginal virginity.&lt;ref name="Crooks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Momoh"/&gt; [[Comfort Momoh]] stated it may be that female genital mutilation was "practiced in ancient Egypt as a sign of distinction among the aristocracy"; there are reports that traces of infibulation are on Egyptian mummies.&lt;ref name="Momoh" /&gt;

Custom and tradition are the most frequently cited reasons for the practice of female genital mutilation. Some cultures believe that female genital mutilation is part of a girl's initiation into adulthood and that not performing it can disrupt social and political cohesion.&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Momoh"/&gt; In these societies, a girl is often not considered an adult unless she has undergone the procedure.&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"/&gt;

The vagina is a structure of animals in which the female is [[internal fertilization|internally fertilized]], rather than by [[traumatic insemination]] used by some invertebrates. The shape of the vagina varies among different animals. In [[Placentalia|placental mammals]] and [[Marsupial reproductive system|marsupials]], the vagina leads from the [[uterus]] to the exterior of the female body. Female marsupials [[Marsupial female reproductive system|have two lateral vaginas]], which lead to separate uteri, but both open externally through the same orifice; a third canal, which is known as the median vagina, and can be transitory or permanent, is used for birth.&lt;ref name="Tyndale-BiscoeRenfree1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hugh Tyndale-Biscoe|author2=Marilyn Renfree|title=Reproductive Physiology of Marsupials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpjovN0vXW4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=vagina&amp;f=false|date=30 January 1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-33792-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female [[spotted hyena]] does not have an external vaginal opening. Instead, the vagina [[Female genitalia of spotted hyenas|exits through the clitoris]], allowing the females to urinate, copulate and give birth through the clitoris.&lt;ref name="courtship"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szykman M, Van Horn RC, Engh AL, Boydston EE, Holekamp KE |year=2007 |title=Courtship and mating in free-living spotted hyenas |url=http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bowles/Dominance/Papers/SzykmanetalHyenaMatingBehaviour2007.pdf |journal=Behaviour |volume=144 |issue=7 |pages=815–846 |doi=10.1163/156853907781476418|citeseerx=10.1.1.630.5755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vagina of the female [[coyote]] contracts during copulation, forming a [[Canine reproduction#Copulation|copulatory tie]].&lt;ref name = "Bekoff"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bekoff M, Diamond J |title=Precopulatory and Copulatory Behavior in Coyotes |journal=[[Journal of Mammalogy]] |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=372–375 |date=May 1976 |jstor=1379696 |doi=10.2307/1379696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds, monotremes, and some reptiles have a part of the [[oviduct]] that leads to the [[cloaca]].&lt;ref name="Iannaccone"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Iannaccone P |title=Biological Aspects of Disease |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-3718606139|year=1997|pages=315–316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNt2tOsBnc8C&amp;pg=PA315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fishbeck"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Fishbeck DW, Sebastiani A |title=Comparative Anatomy: Manual of Vertebrate Dissection|publisher=Morton Publishing Company|isbn=978-1617310041|year=2012|pages=66–68 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JijAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chickens have a vaginal aperture that opens from the vertical apex of the cloaca. The vagina extends upward from the aperture and becomes the egg gland.&lt;ref name="Fishbeck" /&gt; In some [[jawless fish]], there is neither oviduct nor vagina and instead the egg travels directly through the body cavity (and is fertilised externally as in most [[fish]] and [[amphibian]]s).

A lack of research on the vagina and other female genitalia, especially for different animals, has stifled knowledge on female sexual anatomy.&lt;ref name="Yong E"&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Yong E|title=Where's All The Animal Vagina Research?|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|date=May 6, 2014|access-date=June 6, 2018|url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2014/05/06/wheres-all-the-animal-vagina-research/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Cooper D|title=Female genitalia shunned by researchers|publisher=[[ABC Online]]|date=May 7, 2014|access-date=June 6, 2018|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/05/07/3999220.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation for why male genitalia is studied more includes penises being significantly simpler to analyze than female genital cavities, because male genitals usually protrude and are therefore easier to assess and measure. By contrast, female genitals are more often concealed, and require more dissection, which in turn requires more time.&lt;ref name="Yong E"/&gt; Another explanation is that the function of the penis simply is to impregnate, while female genitals can alter shape upon interaction with male organs, especially as to benefit or hinder [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref name="Yong E"/&gt;

'''Vincas Kudirka''' ({{OldStyleDate|31 December|1858|19 December}} &amp;ndash; {{OldStyleDate|16 November|1899|4 November}}) was a [[Lithuania]]n poet and physician, and the author of both the music and lyrics of the Lithuanian [[National Anthem]], ''[[Tautiška giesmė]]''. He is regarded in Lithuania as a National Hero. Kudirka used [[pen name]]s V. Kapsas, Paežerių Vincas, Vincas Kapsas, P.Vincas, Varpas, Q.D, K., V.K, Perkūnas.

Kudirka was born in [[Paežeriai]].  He began studying history and philosophy in [[Warsaw]] in 1881, but changed his major and began studying [[medicine]] the following year. During his studies, he was arrested as a subversive for having a copy of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' in his possession, and was expelled from the [[University of Warsaw]], but later re-admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antologija.lt/texts/22/autor.html |title= Vincas Kudirka |accessdate=2008-06-13 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Lithuanian Classic Literature Anthology}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1889, and worked as a country doctor in [[Šakiai]] and [[Kudirkos Naumiestis|Naumiestis]].

Kudirka began writing poetry in 1888. Simultaneously he became more active in the [[Lithuanian national rebirth]] movement. Together with other Lithuanian students in Warsaw, he founded the secret society ''Lietuva'' ("Lithuania"). The following year the society began publishing the clandestine newspaper ''[[Varpas]]'' ("The Bell"),&lt;ref name="EL"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] |title=Vincas Kudirka |url=http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/Vincas_Kudirka.en.htm |accessdate=2008-06-13 |edition= |date= |year=1970–1978 |publisher= |volume=4 |location=Boston |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Kudirka edited and contributed to  for the next ten years. In issue number 6 of ''Varpas'', in September 1898, he published the text of ''Tautiška Giesmė'', which would officially become in 1918, the Lithuanian National Anthem, set to music written by Kudirka himself for a [[violin]].

Kudirka gave much to Lithuanian culture, and also published a collection of Lithuanian popular songs. He was also a noted writer of satire.

He died of [[tuberculosis]] at [[Kudirkos Naumiestis|Naumiestis]], on 16 November 1899, at age 40. The second half of ''Tautiška Giesmė'' was engraved on his gravestone.

On 5 July 2009, a statue of Vincas Kudirka was unveiled beside the [[Gediminas Avenue]], the main street of the capital Vilnius. The unveiling, by dignitaries, including the Lithuanian President [[Valdas Adamkus]], coincided with festivities marking the 1000th anniversary of the first time Lithuania was mentioned in official chronicles.
