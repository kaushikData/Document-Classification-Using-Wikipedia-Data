The '''1914 Stanley Cup Finals''' was a series between the [[Victoria Aristocrats]], champions of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHA), and the [[Toronto Blueshirts|Toronto Hockey Club]], champions of the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA). The Torontos defeated the Aristocrats in three games to win the best-of-five series. It was the first officially sanctioned series for the [[Stanley Cup]] between the two leagues, starting the "World's Series" era where the NHL champion played off against a PCHA or Western league champion annually for the Stanley Cup. It was also the final series of the "challenge" era, where inter-league series for the Stanley Cup were sanctioned by the Stanley Cup trustees. An anticipated follow-on challenge series between Toronto and [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]], champions of the Maritime League did not take place as Sydney abandoned their challenge for the Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=March 21, 1914 |title=Championship Hockey Over In Toronto For Year |page=8 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OHcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6ygDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4359%2C6716398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paths to the Finals==

Nearing the end of the season, the NHA made arrangements for the NHA champion to receive a challenge from the [[Sydney Millionaires (MaPHL)|Sydney Millionaires]], Maritime champions, ordered by the Stanley Cup trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |work=Saskatoon Phoenix |date=February 28, 1914
 |title=Dates for Big Hockey Matches Uncertain
 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As arranged by the NHA, the series would have taken place on March 9 through 11. After that, the winner would face off in a series with the PCHA champions in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |title=All Stanley Cup Games in Arena |work=Toronto World |date=February 25, 1914 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tie in the NHA standings meant that the March 9–11 dates were spent on the Toronto – Montreal series, while the Toronto-Victoria series went ahead as scheduled, and the challenge of Sydney was not played.

After dispatching the Canadiens, the Blue Shirts faced off against the [[Victoria Aristocrats]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]]. A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, stating that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |work=Saskatoon Phoenix |title=Stanley Cup Contest May Not Be for the Mug, After All is Said |date=March 18, 1914 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on March 18, Trustee [[William Foran]] stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president [[Frank Patrick (ice hockey)|Frank Patrick]] had not filed a challenge, because he had expected [[Emmett Quinn]] of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the series was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Montreal Daily Mail |date=March 19, 1914 |title=A Tempest In a Teapot |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe and Mail |title=Stanley Cup Muddle Cleared Up |date=March 19, 1914 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several days later, Foran wrote to Quinn that the trustees are "perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues (NHA, PCHA and Maritime) to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the Cup."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World
 |title=Three Pro Leagues as to Stanley Cup |date=March 25, 1914 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game summaries==

The first game, the first Stanley Cup game in Toronto, was played under NHA rules. Toronto won 5–2 as the "Coast Champions Did Not Show Expected Form" according to the ''Toronto Globe''. Victoria had too much individual play and not enough "team play and combination work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
 |work=The Globe |date=March 16, 1914 |title=First Stanley Cup Game for Torontos |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scotty Davidson]], Toronto's captain, sat out the second game due to the flu. The second game was seven-man hockey, played under PCHA rules, which also meant dividing up the ice into three zones, with the centre zone open to "off-side" passing. Toronto led 3–2 after the first period. [[Lester Patrick]] scored twice and [[Tommy Dunderdale]] scored in the second to give Victoria a 5–3 lead after two periods. [[Frank Foyston]] scored twice in the third to tie the score, sending it to overtime. McGiffin scored the winning goal after 18 minutes of overtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Globe |date=March 18, 1914 |title=Victoria Beaten at Their Own Style |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson returned for the third game as a substitute for [[Cully Wilson]]. The Victoria forwards back-checked well and reduced the shooting opportunities of Toronto. The game had a lot of rough play, and "the man with the puck was generally sent sprawling before he had a chance to shoot," according to ''The Globe.'' The Victoria forwards played a good game bringing many shots against Toronto's [[Hap Holmes|Harry Holmes]] in net. Victoria's Patrick injured his wrist in the second period and could not shoot after that. Davidson and [[Bobby Genge]] started a fight at 15 minutes of the third period, clearing the benches. Foyston scored for Toronto in the second period, and Cameron scored in the third to score the winning goal. Victoria's [[Dubby Kerr]] scored with seven minutes to go, but Victoria was not able to get an equalizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Globe

All games played at [[Arena Gardens]].

Total attendance for the series was 14,260 for an average of 4,753 in the 7,500 capacity Arena. At the time, professional hockey was less of a draw than [[Ontario Hockey Association]] (OHA) senior hockey. Two games between local OHA senior teams had combined to exceed 14,000 total attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe |date=March 21, 1914 |title=Puckerings |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torontos players and staff received $297 each as their share of the gate receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe |date=March 21, 1914 |title=Toronto Players Receive $297 Each |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Newsweek'' article, parts of which were subsequently retracted, alleged that government sources had confirmed that United States personnel at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] had deliberately damaged a copy of the book by flushing it in a toilet in order to torment the prison's [[Muslim]] captives.

The ''Newsweek'' article stated that an official had seen a preliminary copy of an unreleased U.S. government report confirming the deliberate damage. Later on, the magazine retracted this when the (still) unnamed official changed his story.  A [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] investigation uncovered at least five cases of Quran mishandling by U.S. personnel at the base, but insisted that none of these were acts of desecration. The Pentagon's report also accused a prisoner of damaging a copy of the [[Quran]] by putting it in a toilet. In 2007, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], suing under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], secured the release of a 2002 FBI report containing a detainee's accusation of ill-treatment, including throwing a Quran into a toilet.&lt;ref name="ACLU"&gt;

This specific accusation had been made on several occasions by other Guantanamo detainees since 2002; ''Newsweek'''s initial account of a government report confirming it sparked protests throughout the [[Islamic world]] and riots in [[Afghanistan]], where pre-planned demonstrations turned deadly. A worldwide controversy followed.

The ''Newsweek'' affair turned the spotlight on earlier media reports of such incidents. Accusations of Quran desecration as a part of U.S. interrogations at prisons in Afghanistan and [[Iraq]] as well as Guantánamo Bay had been made by a number of sources going back to 2002.

==History==
There were over a dozen pre-''Newsweek'' reports in the mainstream media alleging U.S. Quran abuse, including the following:
* Several times in 2002 and in early 2003, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] reported complaints by detainees at Guantanamo Bay prison of desecration of the Quran by U.S. guards in Guantanamo.&lt;ref name="AlJazeera20050521"&gt;

* The [[BBC]] reported on December 30, 2004, that the former Guantánamo prisoner [[Abdallah Tabarak]] maintained that "American soldiers used to tear up copies of the Quran  and throw them in the toilet."
* In a book review dated January 16, 2005, the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' reported that five British detainees, after their release, claimed that they "had seen other prisoners sexually humiliated, had been hooded, and were forced to watch copies of the Koran being flushed down toilets."
* ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported on January 20, 2005, that there were complaints concerning guards who had "defaced their copies of the Koran and, in one case, had thrown it in a toilet."
* ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' reported on March 6, 2005, that three Guantánamo captives — Fawzi al Odah, 27, Fouad al Rabiah, 45, and Khalid al Mutairi, 29 — "separately complained to their lawyer that military police threw their Quran  into the toilet."
* ''The Miami Herald'' also reported on March 9, 2005, that Guantánamo Base staff insulted [[Allah]] and "threw Qurans  into toilets".

== The ''Newsweek'' report ==
On April 30, 2005, ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine published an article claiming that an unnamed United States official had seen a government report supporting a "previously unreported" charge. Among the previously unreported cases that sources reportedly told ''Newsweek'': interrogators, in an attempt to rattle suspects, flushed a Quran down a toilet and led a detainee around with a collar and dog leash.&lt;ref name="Newsweek20050508gitmo"&gt;John Barry and [[Michael Isikoff]], [http://www.newsweek.com/2005/05/08/gitmo-southcom-showdown.html Gitmo: SouthCom Showdown], ''Newsweek'', May 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The prospect that U.S. personnel may have deliberately defaced the Quran provoked massive anti-U.S. demonstrations throughout the Islamic world, with at least 17 deaths during riots in [[Afghanistan]].

The ''Newsweek'' article, by reporter [[Michael Isikoff]], was one of over a dozen such reports of similar incidents that had surfaced in prior months in the U.S. and UK media, but the first involving a U.S. government source acknowledging an inquiry into the event. The Isikoff article was later retracted by ''Newsweek'', which nonetheless defended both its reporter and the story, stating "neither we nor the Pentagon had any idea it would lead to deadly riots." The case turned the spotlight on other reports of desecration of the Quran at Guantánamo.

The article went largely unnoticed for five days. On May 6, Pakistani politician, [[Imran Khan]], held a press conference. Khan criticized his country's government, saying, "This war on terrorism is self-defeating if, on the one hand, you [Musharraf] are demanding that we help them and on the other hand, they are desecrating the book on which our entire faith is based." Khan's press conference was rebroadcast throughout the Muslim world.

The ''Newsweek'' report cited an anonymous source, said to be a senior government official, who claimed to have seen a confidential investigative report documenting the alleged incident — in which interrogators, "in an attempt to rattle suspects, reportedly flushed a Quran down a toilet." However, on May 16, ''Newsweek'' retracted the statement that the abuse had been uncovered by an "internal military investigation." after the source of the story was later unable to confirm where he had seen the information. In its May 23 issue, ''Newsweek'' stated that

{{quote|Our original source later said he couldn't be certain about reading of the alleged Quran incident in the report we cited, and said it might have been in other investigative documents or drafts. Top administration officials have promised to continue looking into the charges, and so will we. But we regret that we got any part of our story wrong, and extend our sympathies to victims of the violence and to the U.S. soldiers caught in its midst.}}

''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted Isikoff as saying:

{{quote|Neither ''Newsweek'' nor the Pentagon foresaw that a reference to the desecration of the Quran  was going to create the kind of response that it did. The Pentagon saw the item before it ran, and then they didn't move us off it for 11 days afterward. They were as caught off guard by the furor as we were. We obviously blame ourselves for not understanding the potential ramifications.}}

==International reaction ==

On May 10 and continuing the following week, many violent anti-American protests took place. In [[Afghanistan]], demonstrations that began in the eastern provinces and spread to [[Kabul]] were reported to have caused at least seventeen deaths. The [[United Nations]], as a precautionary measure, withdrew all its foreign staff from [[Jalalabad]], where two of its guest houses were attacked, government buildings and shops were targeted, and the offices of two international aid groups were destroyed. Demonstrations also took place in [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]], [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], Pakistan and [[Indonesia]], leading to the death of at least 15 people.&lt;ref name="Bbc29959512"&gt;

White House press secretary [[Scott McClellan]] said, "The report had real consequences, people have lost their lives. Our image abroad has been damaged." However, in a press release issued by the [[United States Department of State]] on May 12, General [[Richard B. Myers]] claimed that the ''Newsweek'' story was not a chief cause of the riots: "He has been told that the Jalalabad, Afghanistan, rioting was related more to the ongoing political reconciliation process in Afghanistan than anything else." &lt;ref name="StateDeptDenials"&gt;

On May 27, thousands of demonstrators gathered in what ''The New York Times'' referred to as "waves of protest" in Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and the Middle East, "mostly centered on Friday prayer gatherings". The ''New York Times'' reported that U.S. flags were burned at some demonstrations, and that, although most of the protests were peaceful, overt calls for an "Islamic revolution" were loudly supported by the crowds in Pakistan, further complicating a difficult political situation for General Musharraf.

A [[Red Cross]] spokesperson Simon Schorno confirmed that U.S. personnel at [[Camp X-ray]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} had displayed "disrespect" to the Quran, and that U.S. officials knew of this activity. Delegates from the International Committee of the Red Cross informed U.S. authorities, who took action to stop the alleged abuse, said Schorno. He declined to specify the nature of the incidents.

{{quote|"We're basically referring in general terms to disrespect of the Quran, and that's where we leave it", Schorno told The Associated Press. "We believe that since, U.S. authorities have taken the corrective measures that we required in our interventions."&lt;ref name="LATimes20050522"&gt;

==US military findings==
On June 3, 2005, a U.S. military investigation by the base commander, Brigadier General Jay Hood, reported four (possibly five) incidents of "mishandling" of the Quran by U.S. personnel at Guantánamo Bay. Hood said his investigation "revealed a consistent, documented policy of respectful handling of the Quran dating back almost two and a half years."&lt;ref name="VoaNews20050603a"&gt;

According to the Hood report:
* a soldier intentionally kicked a Quran;
* an interrogator intentionally stepped on a Quran;
* a guard's urine came through an air vent, unintentionally splashing a detainee and his Quran;
* water balloons thrown by prison guards at one another unintentionally caused a number of Qurans to get wet; and
* a two-word obscenity was written in English on the inside cover of a Quran (whether US personnel were responsible for this act, however, could not be confirmed).
The report laid out the circumstances of these incidents and disciplinary actions taken.  It also stressed that such mishandling was rare, and that guards were usually respectful of the Quran, following strict regulations the military laid down for handling the Quran.&lt;ref name="VoaNews20050603b"&gt;

The Hood report also listed 15 reported incidents of detainees mishandling their own copies of the Quran, including complaints made by other detainees.
One of these cases involved a prisoner "attempting to flush a Quran down the toilet and urinating on the Quran."

The statement did not provide any explanation about why the detainees might have abused their own holy books.&lt;ref name=Cbc20050604/&gt;

==FBI documents and other reports==
The ''Newsweek'' article and the ensuing controversy turned the spotlight on other reports of Qu'ran desecration and spurred additional investigations by others. After a verdict by a federal court on May 25, 2005, the [[ACLU|American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) obtained documents from the [[FBI]] interrogations of [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp#Detention of prisoners|Guantánamo Bay]] detainees dating back to August 2002. The documents stated that some detainees had claimed to have witnessed Quran desecration (including "flush[ing] a Quran in the toilet"), among other acts, on many occasions by their guards — in a document dated August 1, 2002. The pertinent excerpt reads as follows:

{{quote|[P]rior to his capture, [name redacted] had no information against the United States. Personally, he has nothing against the United States. The guards in the detention facility do not treat him well. Their behavior is bad. About five months ago, the guards beat the detainees. They flushed a Koran in the toilet. The guards dance around when the detainees are trying to pray. The guards still do these things.&lt;ref name="AcluFbiSecret"&gt;

The ruling of the court forcing the release of this and other documents came under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N25430006.htm News - AlertNet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, in a news release, that "The United States government continues to [[turn a blind eye]] to mounting evidence of widespread abuse of detainees held in its custody."

The FBI declared that it could not investigate the matter, as it was up to the Defense Department to do so. For its part, the Pentagon, through its spokesman Lawrence Di Rita, appeared to have transitioned from flat denials to vagueness and unsettled syntax: "There have been instances, and we'll have more to say about it as we learn more, but where a Quran may have fallen to the floor in the course of searching a cell." Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, told reporters that "past accusations have had credibility issues."

James Jaffer, an attorney working for the ACLU, was quoted by the ''New York Times'' as stating that errors in the ''Newsweek'' story had been used to discredit other investigative efforts conducted by his organization and other groups "that were not based on anonymous sources, but [on] government documents, reports written by FBI agents."

Many questioned the veracity of such accounts, noting that the FBI, in 2004, had released a captured Al-Qaeda training manual&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050331091340/http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/trainingmanual.htm captured Al-Qaeda training manual]&lt;/ref&gt; which [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[United States President|Presidency]] spokesmen claimed shows that Al-Qaeda members are trained to make false accusations once captured.
&lt;!--
Actually, the manual tells readers to seek a medical examination prior to capture, to provide a "before" picture. Arguably, this is the exact opposite of what they should do if they were going to lie about torture. This document was written prior to 9-11, when if potential readers of the manual were captured they would be captured by countries known to make routine use of torture.

IMO Bush Presidency spin-doctors are deliberately misinterpreting this document, trusting that readers won't bother to download it and read it for themselves.

IMO the manual is not instructing it readers to lie about torture.  Rather the manual assumes its readers will face torture.
--&gt;

==The SERE connection==

Several reports have alleged a connection between events at Guantanamo Bay and a Department of Defense program "[[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]]" (SERE).

On May 16, 2005, [[Juan Cole]] published an email from a former SERE attendee who reported abuse of the Christian holy book in training.&lt;ref name="JuanCole"&gt;
{{cite news

The emailer had no direct knowledge of operations at Guantanamo, but noted that this tactic sounded similar to that alleged in the Newsweek story.

In July 2005, an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine suggested that the SERE program involved a number of techniques which paralleled those allegedly used at Guantánamo Bay, including the desecration of religious texts. The writer contacted Juan Cole's anonymous source who said that in 1999 he attended a Navy SERE program in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Jane|title=In Gitmo|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/articles/050711on_onlineonly01|publisher=''The New Yorker''|date=July 6, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050709021535/http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/articles/050711on_onlineonly01|archive-date=July 9, 2005|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:So the [[Bible]] trashing happened when this guy had us all in the courtyard sitting for one of his speeches. They were tempting us with a big pot of soup that was boiling - we were all starving from a few days of chow deprivation. He brought out the Bible and started going off on it verbally - how it was worthless, we were forsaken by God, etc. Then he threw it on the ground and kicked it around. It was definitely the climax of his speech. Then he kicked over the soup pot and threw us back in the cells.

The SERE program's chief psychologist, Col. Morgan Banks, issued guidance in early 2003 for "behavioral science consultants" who helped to devise Guantánamo's interrogation strategy—although Banks has emphatically denied that he advocated the use of SERE counter-resistance techniques to break down detainees.  However, General [[James T. Hill]], chief of the U.S. Southern Command, confirmed that a team from Guantanamo went "up to our SERE school and developed a list of techniques" for "high-profile, high-value" detainees.  According to an [[editorial|op-ed]] in the November 14, 2005 ''The New York Times'' by M. Gregg Bloche and Jonathan H. Marks, two lawyers with no first-hand knowledge of SERE, "General Hill had sent this list -- which included prolonged isolation and sleep deprivation, stress positions, physical assault and the exploitation of detainees' phobias -- to Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], who approved most of the tactics in December 2002.  Some within the Pentagon warned that these tactics constituted torture, but a top adviser to Secretary Rumsfeld justified them by pointing to their use in SERE training, a senior Pentagon official told us last month."&lt;ref name="Nytimes20051114"&gt;

The '''2015 Turkey blackout''' was a widespread [[power outage]] that occurred in almost all parts of [[Turkey]] in the morning of Tuesday, 31 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey's power outage linked to mismanagement, grid director resigns|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2015/04/06/turkeys-power-outage-linked-to-mismanagement-grid-director-resigns|website=DailySabah|accessdate=September 2, 2017|date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to line maintenance on the main East-West corridor, which connects hydropower rich Eastern Turkey with the population centers in Western Turkey, the remaining lines became overloaded after the Osmanca – Kursunlu line tripped, as the system was not in a n-1 secure state. The electric system in Turkey split in half at CET 09:36:11 and separated from the Central European (CE) synchronous zone, i.e. connecting lines to Greece and Bulgaria also tripped. This was the reason that the disturbances had only effects in Turkey and did not cascade to neighbouring countries.

The two parts inside Turkey behaved differently. The Western part suffered from a lack generation (21%) and frequency went down. Load shedding schemes did stabilize the frequency, but as some power plants did not cope with running at reduced frequency, additional power was lost and resulted in a blackout of the Western part. The Eastern part suffered from [[hydropower]] oversupply (41%) that wasn't able to flow westward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sabadus|first1=Aura|title=Turkey's blackout caused by line maintenance, hydro production oversupply|url=http://www.icis.com/resources/news/2015/04/16/9876979/turkey-s-blackout-caused-by-line-maintenance-hydro-production-oversupply-teias/|website=www.icis.com|accessdate=September 2, 2017|date=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey’s 10-Hour Blackout Shows Threat to World Power Grids|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-01/turkish-blackout-shows-world-power-grids-under-threat|website=Bloomberg.com|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern part was accelerated by ca. 1.6 Hz/s and culminated at 52.3 Hz. Power plants tripped due to overfrequency and the initially oversupplied Eastern part collapsed at underfrequency values less than 47.0 Hz.

At 16:12 (CET) - ca. 6.5 hours after the blackout - the Western and Eastern part were resynchronised, while the Turkish grid was already about 80% energized. At 18:30 almost 95% of the loads were served again.

The year '''519 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 235 '' [[Ab urbe condita]]'''''. The denomination 519 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8140">'''Amatius''' (also referred to as '''Herophilus''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], 9.15.2&lt;/ref&gt; '''Chamates''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''Epit.'' 116&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Pseudo-Marius'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' 3. 2&lt;/ref&gt;) (died 13 April 44 BC) was a man who claimed to be the son of [[Gaius Marius the Younger]], and therefore the grandson of the famous Roman general [[Gaius Marius]]. He was murdered on the orders of [[Mark Antony]] following the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]].

==Biography==
Amatius, calling himself Gaius Marius, first appeared in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] in 45 BC, where he presented himself as the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]] of the towns founded by Marius's grandfather and populated by the descendants of the legionary veterans who were established there. Taking advantage of the [[Roman Dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]]'s absence in Spain, he cultivated the support of the various [[Plebs|plebeian]] ''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]]'', and became enormously popular in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; He was apparently wealthy enough to open up his gardens in order to entertain the people of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus, 9.15.1&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time Caesar returned to Rome in May 45 BC, Amatius contacted the former [[Roman consul]] [[Cicero]], asking for his help as a defender, presumably concerning a legal case.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero, writing to [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]] on 20 May 45 BC, says he refused, citing Marius' close familial links with Julius Caesar as the reason (Marius' grandmother was an aunt of Julius Caesar). It is uncertain whether the two events were linked, but in the autumn of 45 BC, Caesar expelled Amatius from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

With Julius Caesar's assassination in 15 March 44 BC, Amatius returned from exile and attempted to set himself up as leader of the city's plebeian masses. Assuming the role of Caesar's avenger, in early April 44 BC he erected an altar to Caesar on the spot where the dictator's body had been burnt. Once again his popularity skyrocketed, causing the consul [[Mark Antony]] some concern, as he was expecting the plebs or Rome to rally around him.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing news that self-proclaimed Marius had gathered together a street gang and was planning to capture and kill two of Caesar's assassins ([[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]]), Mark Antony ordered his capture and put him to death without a trial on April 13.&lt;ref&gt;Sumi, pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appian, ''Civil Wars'' 3. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'', 14.8.1&lt;/ref&gt; Although an illegal act, the [[Senate of the Roman Republic|Senate]] approved of it, as they were concerned about Cassius and Brutus' safety. Amatius' body was dragged around the city and eventually thrown into the [[Tiber river]]. His followers gathered at the [[Roman Forum]] and demanded that the altar he had erected be dedicated to Marius, but Antony sent in soldiers to disperse the mob and kill the principal ringleaders.

==Identity of Amatius==
It remains unclear who this Amatius was. According to [[Valerius Maximus]], he was a former eye doctor called Herophilus, while [[Livy]] said he was a low born individual named Chamates. Finally, [[Appian]] says that he was an impostor called Amatius. Modern scholarly opinion has largely followed the imperial historians' opinion, and declared that Amatius was not the grandson of Gaius Marius, with suggestions including a runaway slave, or a freedman, or an illegitimate son of Gaius Marius the Younger.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 113&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only extant eyewitness, [[Cicero]], has provided two very different accounts a year apart. In the first account, in the letter to Atticus in 45 BC, he casts no doubt on the identity of the so-called Marius - he explicitly names him as Gaius Marius, son of Gaius and grandson of Gaius. Then, in April 44 BC, when he hears of Amatius' activities in Rome, he still refers to him as Marius, and on hearing of his death on April 13, explicitly names him the grandson of [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]] - the father-in-law of Gaius Marius the Younger.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by September 44 BC, Cicero's opinion had changed. In the [[Philippicae|1st Philippic]], delivered on 2 September 44 BC, Cicero declares that Marius was an impostor, an (unnamed) runaway slave who had assumed the name of Gaius Marius and had contemplated a massacre of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 118&lt;/ref&gt; It is this assertion of being an impostor that the later Roman historians followed when providing the identity of Amatius.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 119&lt;/ref&gt; However, the political environment in Rome when Cicero delivered his 1st Philippic may have required Cicero to possibly manufacture an alternate identity for Marius, given the longstanding political and friendship ties between the Marii and the Tullii Cicerones, and Cicero's desire not to be tainted by Amatius' subversive activities in April.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pgs. 114-119&lt;/ref&gt;

The families of the ''[[Nobiles]]'' were a small elite aristocratic group in ancient Rome, and well known to each other. It is unlikely that Cicero would have been taken in by an impostor in 45 BC, especially as the two families came from the same town of [[Arpino|Arpinum]].&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Further, when Julius Caesar was confronted by Amatius, he was silent on the matter of Amatius' identity, and rather than having the impostor killed, he had Amatius banished from Rome. Caesar would have known from his aunt (Julia, the wife of the famous Gaius Marius, and who died in 68 BC) whether she had a grandson or not, and his hesitancy in getting rid of Amatius permanently, as well as his not denouncing the supposed impostor, speaks volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is supported by a passage in [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]', ''Life of Augustus'', where he relates that Amatius approached the young [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]] who was accompanied by a number of women from his family. While some of the women acknowledged his paternity as the grandson of Gaius Marius, both [[Atia (mother of Augustus)|Atia]] (Augustus' mother and Julius Caesar's niece) and her younger sister refused to confirm or deny his paternity.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the fact that the veterans in the Italic towns founded by Gaius Marius all acknowledged Amatius as their patron. If he was not a member of the Marii, both the elite families of Rome and the clients of the Marii, both in Rome and across the towns in Italy, would never have acknowledged an impostor as their equal or their patron.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, pg. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless the majority scholarly consensus, based upon the primary sources, remains that Amatius was not the grandson of Gaius Marius. Some see his execution by Mark Antony without trial as evidence of his non-citizen status,&lt;ref&gt;Sumi, pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; that he was quite likely a wealthy freedman, and that his influence was achieved solely through the use of Marius' name.&lt;ref&gt;Steed, pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was originally entertained in 1939 by Carl Diem, chief organiser of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin, who ahead of the 1936 Olympics was already noted for claiming that "[[Germanic peoples|Germanics]] may only be defeated by other Germanics," which turned out not to be the case.&lt;ref name=Rusinek /&gt; The idea was subsequently adopted by Hitler, who told Albert Speer that once the German Stadium was built, there would be no more Olympic Games, only the Aryan Games.&lt;ref&gt; Kruger, Arnd and William Murray.

{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}
In the '''Battle of Sarmin''' (or Battle of Tell Danith) on September 14, 1115, [[Roger of Salerno|Prince Roger of Salerno's]] Crusader army surprised and routed the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk Turkish]] army of [[Bursuq ibn Bursuq]] of Hamadan.

==Background==
In November 1114, a severe earthquake struck the [[Principality of Antioch]], damaging many of its castles. The following spring, while supervising the repair of his strongholds, Prince Roger heard rumors of a Turkish invasion. Since 1111, the Seljuk [[Sultan]] of [[Baghdad]] had directed a series of attacks on [[Antioch]] and the [[County of Edessa]], which were both established in 1098 by Frankish crusading lords and their followers. In 1115, the Sultan sent Bursuq against Antioch. Jealous that their authority would be diminished if the Sultan's forces proved victorious, several Syrian Muslim princes allied themselves with the Latins.

Roger sent spies to observe his enemy's movements, gathered provisions for his army and put his principality into a state of defense. His 2,000-man army, which included both knights and infantry, assembled {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of Antioch at [[Demirköprü, Antakya|Jisr al-Hadid]], a bridge over the [[Orontes River]]. He then advanced to Atharib, about c. {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Antioch and c. {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Halab|Aleppo]]. Here Roger came to an agreement with his Muslim allies, [[Toghtekin]] of [[Damascus]], [[Ilghazi]] of [[Mardin]] and Lulu of Aleppo. Subsequently, both Christians and Muslims were embarrassed by this pact.&lt;ref name="Smail, p 145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smail|1995|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
The allies moved 80 kilometers south to the walled town of [[Apamea (Syria)|Afamiya]]. This move placed the combined army where it could maneuver to protect Aleppo, Damascus or Antioch. Once he was certain the Turks were on the march, Roger sent a messenger to King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] requesting assistance. Bursuq's army suddenly appeared and stormed [[Hama]], a Muslim town only {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Afamiya. The Turkish commander soon made his camp at [[Shaizar]], only 12 kilometers northwest of Hama.

Baldwin immediately mobilized 500 knights and 1,000 foot soldiers from the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and started north. On his way, he added [[Pons of Tripoli|Count Pons]] with 200 knights and 2,000 infantry from the [[County of Tripoli]] to his army. He sent a message forbidding Roger from engaging the enemy before his reinforcements arrived.&lt;ref name="Beeler"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beeler|1971|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bursuq's forces soon closed around Roger's armed camp, attempting to lure the Antiochenes and their allies into a premature attack. Their harassing attacks severely provoked the Latins. Such was the eagerness of the Frankish knights to close with their enemies that Roger threatened to put out the eyes of any man who sallied out of the camp without permission. Later, he rode through the camp with his sword drawn to emphasize his point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smail|1995|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Bursuq heard of Baldwin's relieving force, he withdrew to the east. Counting the 5,000 followers of his Muslim allies, Baldwin's combined army may have been as large as 10,700 men.&lt;ref name="Beeler" /&gt; The allies advanced to Shaizar and burned the lower town as punishment for aligning itself with the Seljuks. When Bursuq didn't turn back to defend the town, the allied leaders assumed the campaign was over. The Muslim Syrians and the Christian princes took their followers home.

==Battle==
As soon as the allied host dispersed, Bursuq invaded again and captured the Christian-held town of [[Kafartab|Kafr Tab]], near Afamiya. Wearily, Roger recalled his Antiochene army and took to the field again. Some forces from the nearby [[County of Edessa]] also participated. Meanwhile, Bursuq took his army in the direction of [[Zardana|Zerdana]], c. {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} east-southeast of Antioch. Roger based his army {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Antioch at the castle of Rugia, at a bridge on the Orontes near [[Jisr al-Shughur]], Syria.

Early on September 14, Roger received intelligence that his opponents were carelessly going into camp at the Tell Danith watering point, near Sarmin. He rapidly advanced and took Bursuq's army by complete surprise. As the Crusaders launched their attack, some Turkish soldiers were still straggling into the camp. Roger marshalled the Frankish army into left, center and right divisions. [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin, Count of Edessa]] led the left wing while Prince Roger personally commanded the center. The Crusaders attacked in [[Echelon formation|echelon]] with the left wing leading.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once the fighting began, the issue was not long in doubt. On the left the Franks soon broke the main strength of the Turks, who had withdrawn to a hillside behind their camp, while Roger occupied the camp itself. Only on the right were the Franks in difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smail|1995|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the Frankish right, the [[Turcopoles]], who were employed as archers, were thrown back by a Seljuk counterattack. This disrupted the knights who faced tough fighting before repulsing their enemies on this part of the field. Roger decisively defeated Bursuq's army, ending the long campaign.

==Aftermath==
Nothing is known about the losses of the Turkish army. Frankish losses were probably light. In the spring, Bursuq's army was probably larger than the army of Roger and his Syrian allies. The Turkish general withdrew in the face of Baldwin's advance, indicating that the King of Jerusalem may have achieved superiority in numbers, or at least parity. Bursuq's army may have dwindled as the campaign dragged on, since it is known that some of the emirs were upset with his division of the spoils.&lt;ref name="Smail, p 145"/&gt; Roger mustered 2,000 in the spring, but, without support from his recent Christian and Muslim allies, he may have called up a larger army for his fall campaign, perhaps 3,000 men.

Roger's victory preserved the Crusader hold on Antioch. But four years later, Roger was to lose his life and his army at the [[Battle of Ager Sanguinis]].

[[Group Captain]] '''Brian Paddon''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (24 August 1908 &amp;ndash; 1967?), was a [[Royal Air Force]] pilot who became a [[prisoner of war]] and successfully escaped from [[Colditz Castle]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].

==Early life==
Paddon was born in [[Carshalton]], [[Surrey]], the son of the Reverend Charles Salmon Paddon and his wife Nellie Symington Paddon.&lt;ref name="census1911" /&gt;&lt;ref name="raec"&gt;Royal Aero Club Aviator's Licence 10796.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1911 Census of Redruth in Cornwall, Paddon, aged two, is living with his parents at Lannarth Vicarage.&lt;ref name="census1911"&gt;[[Census in the United Kingdom|1911 Census of Redruth]], RG14/13962, Brian Paddon, age 2, at Lannarth Vicarage, Redruth, Cornwall, born Carshalton, Surrey.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal Air Force service==

Paddon joined the [[RAF]] on a short service commission as a [[pilot officer]] (on probation) in June 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33515/pages/4544 ''The London Gazette'']&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his [[Royal Aero Club]] Aviator's Licence #10796 on 3 September 1932.&lt;ref name="raec" /&gt;

Paddon was shot down flying [[Bristol Blenheim]] L8827 of [[No. 40 Squadron RAF]] during an attack at [[Saint-Valery-en-Caux|Saint-Valéry-en-Caux]] on 6 June 1940 as part of the [[Battle of France]].&lt;ref name="chorley"&gt;Chorley, W R. (1998). RAF Bomber Command Losses of the Second World War, Vol 1 – 1939/1940. Midland Publishing. {{ISBN|0904597857}}. Page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured and became a [[prisoner of war]].&lt;ref name="chorley" /&gt;

==Prisoner of war==

After passing through the interrogation and transit camp of [[Dulag luft]], he was first sent to [[Oflag IX-A/H]] at [[Spangenberg]], before shortly afterwards leaving for [[Stalag Luft I]] at [[Barth, Germany|Barth]], arriving there on 12 July 1940,&lt;ref&gt;'Wires &amp; Walls' by [[Charles Rollings]], page 116&lt;/ref&gt; where he became the Senior British Officer.&lt;ref&gt;WO208/3282 - Official Camp History SL1 Part I, Chapter I, Para (c)&lt;/ref&gt;

After several escape attempts from various camps, he was sent to [[Oflag IV-C]] at [[Colditz Castle]], arriving there on 14 May 1941 with three other officers, including [[Airey Neave]].&lt;ref&gt;''Colditz - The Full Story'' by [[Pat Reid]] Appendix I&lt;/ref&gt;

After several more attempts to escape, on 11 June 1942, he was sent to a [[court-martial]] at [[Stalag XX-A]] for insulting a German officer during one of his previous escape attempts. However, he managed to escape from his cell, and with the aid of other British prisoners of war, left the camp with a work party, slipped away and travelled to [[Danzig]]. He stowed away on a Swedish ship and successfully reached neutral Sweden on 18 June. He returned to the UK on 6 August 1942.&lt;ref&gt;WO208/3288 - Official Camp History - O4C Chapter X para (2)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35731/supplements/4342 ''The London Gazette'']&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to [[group captain]]. He was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

Paddon married Sheila Mary Mansell in 1935, but she died in Malta on 23 September 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://website.lineone.net/~stephaniebidmead/imtarfa.htm IMTARFA MILITARY CEMETERY]&lt;/ref&gt;  They had two daughters, Erica and Shane.

He married again in 1948 to Anita Williams; they had three daughters - Patricia (born 12/11/1949 in Wendover, Aylesbury, UK), Wendy (born 19/3/1951) and Bridget (born 7/11/1953) both born in Rhodesia.&lt;ref name="Times51254"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Marriages |author=

He later married Kay Paddon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/hundredth-birthday-celebrations-with-the-mayor-1-1406205 |title=MAYOR Colin Belsey turned out to wish happy birthday to centenarian Kay Paddon. |date=8 September 2006 |newspaper=[[Eastbourne Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paddon retired from service on 10 November 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/39065/supplements/5669 ''The London Gazette'']&lt;/ref&gt; He died in retirement in Rhodesia in 1967.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Inigo jones theatre.jpg|thumb|These plans, originally thought to be drawn by [[Inigo Jones]] , but now attributed to his protege John Webb, may be for the '''Cockpit Theatre'''. The drawings were originally believed to be the Blackfriars theatre.]]
The '''Cockpit''' was a [[theatre]] in [[London]], operating from 1616 to around 1665. It was the first theatre to be located near [[Drury Lane]]. After damage in 1617, it was named '''The Phoenix'''.

==History==
[[File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|thumb|The Cockpit Theatre is labelled to the far left of this London street map. [[:File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|Enlarge]]]]
The original building was an actual cockpit; that is, a staging area for [[cockfight]]s. Most likely a round building with a peaked roof, about {{convert|40|ft|m|0}} in diameter, it was erected under Henry VIII, c. 1530-32, as part of a gaming complex. Records indicate a major restoration in 1581-82 and renovations in 1589-90, 1602-3, and 1608-9 (the latter under the supervision of John Best, "cockmaster" to [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], King [[James I of England|James I's]] eldest son and heir).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Astington|first=John H.|date=Autumn 1982|title="The Whitehall Cockpit: The Building and the Theater"|jstor=43447083|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=12| issue =  3|pages=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Theatres of Inigo Jones and John Webb|last=Orrell|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=9780521255462|location=Cambridge|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gurr and Orrell, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1616, [[Christopher Beeston]] acquired the lease to the building and converted it to an indoor playhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1617, gangs of apprentices attempted to destroy the playhouse, probably out of anger that their favorite plays had been removed from the Red Bull outdoor amphitheater, which charged only one penny for admission, to this more expensive (six-penny) venue''.'' Beeston's rapid restoration of the playhouse after this riot may be why it was sometimes called the Phoenix.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Like earlier theatres, such as [[The Theatre]] in [[Shoreditch]] and [[Globe Theatre|The Globe]] in [[Southwark]], the location was just outside the jurisdiction of the [[City of London]]. Beeston expanded the original small building; the construction work prompted complaints by neighbors, which left traces in the legal records of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr and Orrell, pp. 142-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting theatre was, by one estimate, {{convert|52|ft|m|0}} by  {{convert|37|ft|m|0}}, "noticeably smaller than the [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfriars]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gurr, ''Shakespearean Stage,'' pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect commissioned for the renovation is not known for a certainty, but circumstantial evidence points to [[Inigo Jones]]. Two sheets drawn by Jones and showing the interior and exterior design of ''some'' theatre have survived; [[John Orrell]] makes the case that the theatre is the Cockpit, while allowing that he cannot produce conclusive evidence to that end.&lt;ref&gt;''Shakespeare Survey 30,'' p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1629, Inigo Jones would design another "Cockpit" theatre, a private one within [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] called the [[Cockpit-in-Court]] or Royal Cockpit.)

Beeston intended the Cockpit to serve as an indoor complement to the [[Red Bull Theatre|Red Bull]], the outdoor theatre then home to his acting troupe, [[Queen Anne's Men]]. A winter venue was needed to compete with the [[Blackfriars Theatre]] in the possession of their rival troupe, the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]. After a rocky start, the company proved successful in their new locale. Wickham attributes the success more to the theatre's location and comfort and to the flair of its manager, Beeston, than to the quality of its performers.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beeston would oversee several different troupes in the Cockpit before his death in 1639. [[Queen Anne's Men]] were there from 1617 to 1619; when that company dissolved upon the death of [[Anne of Denmark]] in 1619, their place was taken by [[Prince Charles's Men]] from 1619 to 1622. [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] were there from 1622 to 1624, and perhaps for sporadic periods as early as 1619 (the two companies, Prince Charles's and Lady Elizabeth's, had combined for a time ca. 1615). [[Queen Henrietta's Men]] had a long run at the Cockpit, from 1625 to 1636. The last troupe to occupy the Cockpit in Beeston's lifetime was one of his own creation, the King and Queen's Young Company, colloquially known as [[Beeston's Boys]] &amp;mdash; the last assembly of [[boy player|boy actors]] in the period. They would continue in the theatre under the management of his son [[William Beeston|William]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson. p. 225; Harbage, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

William Beeston was forced out of the theatre when his choice of plays met with the disapproval of the Court. He was replaced by [[William Davenant]] in 1639.  All theatres were [[London theatre closure 1642|closed by Parliament]] in 1642, under the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]].  The Cockpit was used as a schoolroom, but plays continued to be shown illegally.  It was raided by [[Puritan]] soldiers during a performance in 1649 and the players were imprisoned. In 1651 William Beeston paid £200 for repairs to the theatre, in the hope that he would be able to start performances there again &amp;mdash; though the hope proved illusory.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr and Orrell, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last years of the [[English Interregnum]], under the common conceit that music was not acting, Davenant was permitted to present two licensed operas in the Cockpit: ''The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru'' in 1658 and ''Sir Francis Drake'' in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatres were permitted to reopen after the [[English Restoration]] in 1660, when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted [[Letters Patent]] to two companies to perform "legitimate drama" in London: the [[Duke's Company]], led by Davenant, and the [[King's Company]], led by [[Thomas Killigrew]].  Both companies briefly made use of the earlier generation of theatres including the Cockpit and the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]], but quickly moved to newer and more fashionable venues &amp;mdash; Davenant in 1661 to a theatre in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] that was once [[Lisle's Tennis Court]], and Killigrew in 1660 to [[Gibbon's Tennis Court]] in Vere Street. The Cockpit was also used in this era by the companies of [[John Rhodes (17th century)|John Rhodes]] and [[George Jolly]].  [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote in his diary of several visits to the theatre between 1660 and 1663.

In 1663, Killigrew's King's Company opened the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] nearby. The Cockpit was unable to compete with this relatively grand new theatre and was further hamstrung since it was shut out of the monopoly on "legitimate drama" granted to the two [[patent theatre|patent companies]]. There is no record of any play being mounted at the Cockpit after 1665; the eventual fate of the structure is unknown.

The Phoenix was located in the middle of the area bounded today by Drury Lane, Great Queen Street, Great Wild Street, and Kemble Street. The entrance to the theatre was in Cockpit Alley, which ran from Drury Lane to Great Wild Street; the present-day Martlett Court is off Drury Lane roughly opposite where the entrance to Cockpit Alley was.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 623.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2462">'''Combat de Reines''' or '''Swiss Cow fighting'''; ({{lang-fr|Combat de Reines}}), is a traditional event held mostly in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Valais]], in which a cow fights another cow (unlike [[bullfighting]], in which humans fight bulls, often to the death).
Each year, the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss canton]] of Valais hosts a series of cow fights known as ''combats de reines'' ("queen fights"), which began in the 1920s and has drawn as many as 50,000 spectators in a year. The winner is called ''La Reine des Reines'' ("the queen of queens") and increases dramatically in value. At the end of the year, a grand final is held in [[Aproz]], where the six best from seven districts do battle in six weight categories.

[[Cow]]s naturally fight to determine dominance in the [[herd]], and this is the behaviour that is exploited in cow fighting, using cows from the local [[Herens (cattle)|Herens]] breed.  With their [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] blunted, the fights are mainly a pushing contest.  Any cow that backs down from a fight is eliminated until one cow is left standing in the ring.  It sometimes happens that the cows in a fight refuse to engage in physical contact with each other at all. Each fight can last up to 40 minutes.

Similar events take place in [[Savoie]] and [[Haute-Savoie]], [[France]], and in the [[Aosta Valley]] of [[Italy]]

'''Dead Reckoning: Memories of the 1971 Bangladesh War''' is a controversial book on the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] written by [[Sarmila Bose]].&lt;ref name=LawsonControversial&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawson|first=Alastair|title=Controversial book accuses Bengalis of 1971 war crimes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13417170|accessdate=30 December 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book caused an uproar in [[Bangladesh]], where it has been accused of flawed and biased methodology, [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]] and downplaying [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|war crimes]].&lt;ref name="BadrulBadArithmetic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=193941|title=Sarmila Bose and bad arithmetic|last=Ahsan|first=Syed Badrul|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyStarThoughts" /&gt;

== Overview ==
Bose uses personal interviews from all sides of the war.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/05/20115983958114219.html|title=Myth-busting the Bangladesh war of 1971|date=9 May 2011|work=Opinion|publisher=[[Aljazeera]]|agency=[[Aljazeera]]|issue=1|last1=Bose|first1=Sarmila|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It accuses Bangladeshis and Pakistanis of "myth making."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Controversies==

===Criticism===
Bose's study has been criticized by various indian historians and academics for numerous inaccuracies and excessive reliance on Pakistani military and government sources, thereby giving a low estimate of the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bergman|first1=David|title=Questioning an iconic number|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/questioning-an-iconic-number/article5940833.ece|accessdate=28 September 2016|agency=The Hindu|issue=1|publisher=The Hindu|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have accused her of flawed and biased methodology, [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]] and downplaying&lt;ref name=BhaumikBook&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhaumik|first=Subir|title=Book, film greeted with fury among Bengalis|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/04/2011429174141565122.html|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=aljazeera|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|war crimes]].&lt;ref name=SahgalDisappearing&gt;{{cite news|last=Sahgal|first=Gita|newspaper=The Daily Star|title=Dead Reckoning: Disappearing stories and evidence|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=214510|date=18 December 2011|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.bricklanecircle.org/uploads/Flying_Blind.pdf Naeem Mohaiemen, "Flying Blind: Waiting for a real Reckoning on 1971", Economic &amp; Political Weekly, vol xlvi no 36, September 3, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.bricklanecircle.org/uploads/Bose_and_Naeem.pdf Sarmila Bose, "‘Dead Reckoning’: A Response"; Naeem Mohaiemen, "Another Reckoning"; Economic &amp; Political Weekly, vol xlvi no 53, December 31, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyStarThoughts&gt;{{cite news |last=Zeitlin |first=Arnold |date=17 November 2013 |title=Thoughts on Dead Reckoning |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-214413  |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several cases, she misquoted her interviewees and other academics that she cites as reference.&lt;ref name=DailyStarFlying&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohaimen|first=Naeem|title=Flying Blind: Waiting for a Real Reckoning on 1971|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=205005|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bose has been criticised for her bias towards Pakistani Army in the language she deploys – Bangladeshi accounts are labelled "claims", Pakistani officers' accounts are straightforward accounts.&lt;ref name=ButaliaTehelka&gt;{{cite news|last=Butalia|first=Urvashi|title=She Does Not Know Best|url=http://www.tehelka.com/she-does-not-know-best/|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=Tehelka|date=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bose's impartiality has also been questioned due to her role as an advocate of US arms sales to Pakistan.&lt;ref name=SundayGuardianBose&gt;{{cite news|last=Sobhan|first=Zafar|title=Bose is more Pakistani than Jinnah the Quaid|url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/bose-is-more-pakistani-than-jinnah-the-quaid|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=The Sunday Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mookherjee|first=Nayanika|newspaper=The Guardian|title=This account of the Bangladesh war should not be seen as unbiased|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/08/bangladesh-liberation-war-sarmila-bose|date=7 June 2011|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DhakaDebacle&gt;{{cite news|last=Raghavan|first=Srinath|title=A Dhaka Debacle|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/a-dhaka-debacle/824484|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=30 July 2011|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ExpressReading&gt;{{cite news|last=Zia|first=Afia|title=Reading and writing 1971|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/319980/reading-and-writing-1971/|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=The Express Tribune|date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NasirReturn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinion.bdnews24.com/2011/03/14/return-of-sarmila-bose/|title=Return of Sarmila Bose|last=Nasir|first=ABM|date=14 March 2011|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=bdnews24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSMonitorRight&gt;{{cite news|last=Milam|first=William|title=The right stuff: F-16s to Pakistan is wise decision|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0411/p09s02-coop.html|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=11 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Srinath Raghavan]], the author of ''1971: A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh'', calls Bose's book a "disturbing misrepresentation of the 1971 war"&lt;ref&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/a-dhaka-debacle&lt;/ref&gt; and further writes that "it is impossible to review the entire catalogue of evasions, obfuscations, omissions and methodological errors that suffuses the book".&lt;ref&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/a-dhaka-debacle/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Minimization of rapes ====

The most severe criticisms against Bose report that Bose's claims that allegations of genocide and rape by the [[Pakistan Army]] were exaggerated by [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wilson Center [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/book-event-idead-reckoning-memories-the-1971-bangladesh-wari Woodrow Wilson Center Book Launch event]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bricklanecircle.org/uploads/Anatomy_of_Violence_-_Analysis_of_Civil_War_in_East_Pakistan_n_1971.pdf Anatomy of Violence: Analysis of Civil War in East Pakistan in 1971] by Sarmila Bose in the [[Economic and Political Weekly]], 8 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bricklanecircle.org/uploads/Losing_the_vitctims_-_Problems_of_Using_Women_as_Weapons_in_Recounting_the_Bangladesh_War.pdf Losing the Victims: Problems of Using Women as Weapons in Recounting the Bangladesh War] by Sarmila Bose in the [[Economic and Political Weekly]], 22 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She is alleged to have presented selective interviews of witnesses in favour of her opinions.&lt;ref name="SahgalDisappearing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NasirReturn" /&gt;

Bose has been criticized long before publishing the book for her research methodologies. She accepts the statement of Pakistani Brigadier Taj that no women were tortured in [[Rajarbagh|Rajarbag]] to be true even though Taj was not present during the operation. But she invalidates the testimony of an eye witness of the incidents of rape done by Pakistani Army as the witness is illiterate. In another case, she asserted that since one rape victim feared for her life, she must have consented to having sex with Pakistani soldiers.&lt;ref name="MashuqurContinuing"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rahman|first=Mashuqur|title=The continuing rape of our history|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/forum/2007/december/rape.htm|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bose's book implies a claim to being the 'first' to dissect the death toll of 3 million in 1971, Zunaid Kazi had already documented 12 different media estimates of death tolls.&lt;ref name="LawsonControversial" /&gt;

===Response===
Bose has responded to three of her most notable critics – [[Naeem Mohaiemen]], [[Urvashi Butalia]], and Srinath Raghavan.&lt;ref name="DRResponse"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bose|first=Sarmila|date=31 December 2011|title='Dead Reckoning': A Response|url=https://www.academia.edu/1190472/Debating_Sarmila_Bose_2_Bose_responds_Mohaiemen_rejoinder|journal=Economic &amp; Political Weekly|volume=46|issue=53|pages=76–79|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Sarmila Bose has responded to her critics,&lt;ref name="DRResponse" /&gt; and maintains that her research is  unbiased and those she calls her critics who were accusing her of "betrayal" were "those who have profited for so long from [[mythology|mythologizing]] the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|history of 1971]]."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bose also maintains that books written by [[Pakistanis]] on [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|Pakistan Army's atrocity during 1971]], were 'limited'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dead Reckoning|last=Bose|first=Sarmila|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2011|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}

'''Embezzlement''' is the act of withholding [[asset]]s for the purpose of [[criminal conversion|conversion]] ([[theft]]) of such assets, by one or more persons to whom the assets were entrusted, either to be held or to be used for specific purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-explanations.com/definitions/embezzlement.htm Definition of "embezzlement" from Legal Explanations]&lt;/ref&gt; Embezzlement is a type of financial [[fraud]]. For example, a [[lawyer]] might embezzle [[funds]] from the trust accounts of their clients; a [[financial advisor]] might embezzle the funds of investors; and a husband or a wife might embezzle funds from a bank account jointly held with the [[Marriage|spouse]].

Embezzlement usually is a premeditated crime, performed methodically, with precautions that conceal the criminal conversion of the property, which occurs without the knowledge or consent of the affected person. Often it involves the trusted individual embezzling only a small proportion of the total of the funds or resources they receive or control, in an attempt to minimize the risk of the detection of the misallocation of the funds or resources. When successful, embezzlements may continue for many years without detection. The victims often realize that the funds, [[savings]], assets, or other resources, are missing and that they have been duped by the embezzler, only when a relatively large proportion of the funds are needed at one time; or the funds are called upon for another use; or when a major institutional reorganization (the closing or moving of a plant or business office, or a merger/acquisition of a firm) requires the complete and independent accounting of all real and [[liquidation|liquid]] assets, prior to or concurrent with the reorganization.

In the United States, embezzlement is a [[Statutory law|statutory offence]] that, depending on the circumstances, may be a crime under state law, federal law, or both; therefore, the definition of the crime of embezzlement varies according to the given statute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/criminal-offense/federal-embezzlement-laws.htm Federal Embezzlement Laws]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/embezzlement Embezzlement legal definition]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the criminal elements of embezzlement are: (i) the fraudulent (ii) [[criminal conversion|conversion]] (iii) of the [[property]] (iv) of another person (v) by the person who has lawful possession of the property.&lt;ref&gt;Singer and Lafond, Criminal Law, 4th ed. (Aspen 2007) p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-roman
| '''Fraudulence''': The requirement that the conversion be fraudulent requires that the embezzler willfully, and without claim of right or mistake, converted the entrusted property to their own use.
| '''Criminal conversion''': Embezzlement is a crime against ownership, that is, voiding the right of the owner to control the disposition and use of the property entrusted to the embezzler.&lt;ref&gt;Singer &amp; LaFond, Criminal Law (Aspen 1987) p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The element of criminal conversion requires substantial interference with the property rights of the owner (unlike [[larceny]], wherein the slightest movement of the property, when accompanied by the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession of the property is sufficient cause).&lt;ref&gt;Singer &amp; LaFond, Criminal Law (Aspen 1987) p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;
| '''Property''': Embezzlement statutes do not limit the scope of the crime to conversions of personal property. Statutes generally include conversion of tangible personal property, intangible personal property, and [[choses]] in action. [[Real property]] is not typically included.
| '''of another''': A person cannot embezzle his or her own property.
| '''Lawful possession''': The critical element is that the embezzler must have been in lawful possession of the property at the time of the fraudulent conversion, and not merely have custody of the property. If the thief had lawful possession of the property, the crime is embezzlement; if the thief merely had custody, the crime at common law is [[larceny]].&lt;ref&gt;inger &amp; LaFond, Criminal Law (Aspen 1987) p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Embezzlement versus larceny ==

Embezzlement differs from [[larceny]] in three ways. First, in embezzlement, an actual ''[[conversion (law)|conversion]]'' must occur; second, the original taking must not be [[trespass]]ory,&lt;ref&gt;Singer &amp; LaFond, Criminal Law (Aspen 1997) at 213.&lt;/ref&gt; and three, in penalties. To say that the taking was not trespassory is to say that the person(s) performing the embezzlement had the right to possess, use, and/or access the assets in question, and that such person(s) subsequently secreted and converted the assets for an unintended and/or unsanctioned use. ''Conversion'' requires that the secretion interfere with the [[property]], rather than just relocate it. As in larceny, the measure is not the gain to the embezzler, but the loss to the asset stakeholders. An example of ''conversion'' is when a person logs checks in a [[check register]] or transaction log as being used for one specific purpose and then explicitly uses the [[funds]] from the checking account for another and completely different purpose.

It is important to make clear that embezzlement is not always a form of [[theft]] or an act of stealing, since those definitions specifically deal with taking something that does not belong to the perpetrator(s). Instead, embezzlement is, more generically, an act of deceitfully secreting assets by one or more persons that have been ''entrusted'' with such assets. The person(s) entrusted with such assets may or may not have an ownership stake in such assets.

In the case where it is a form of theft, distinguishing between embezzlement and larceny can be tricky.&lt;ref&gt;In their book Criminal Law, Singer and LaFond provide an excellent analytical method for making these distinctions. Singer &amp; LaFond, Criminal Law (Aspen 1997) at 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Making the distinction is particularly difficult when dealing with [[misappropriation]]s of property by employees. To prove embezzlement, the state must show that the employee had possession of the goods "by virtue of his or her employment"; that is, that the employee had formally delegated authority to exercise substantial control over the goods. Typically, in determining whether the employee had sufficient control the courts will look at factors such as the job title, job description and the particular operational practices of the firm or organization. For example, the manager of a shoe department at a [[department store]] would likely have sufficient control over the store's inventory (as head of the shoe department) of shoes; that if they converted the goods to their own use they would be guilty of embezzlement. On the other hand, if the same employee were to steal cosmetics from the cosmetics department of the store, the crime would not be embezzlement but larceny. For a case that exemplifies the difficulty of distinguishing larceny and embezzlement see State v. Weaver, 359 N.C. 246; 607 S.E.2d 599 (2005).

North Carolina appellate courts have compounded this confusion by misinterpreting a statute based on an act passed by parliament in 1528. The [[courts of North Carolina|North Carolina courts]] interpreted this statute as creating an offence called "larceny by employee"; an offence that was separate and distinct from common law larceny.&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-74 provides in part: If any servant or other employee, to whom any money, goods or other chattels, . . . by his master shall be delivered safely to be kept to the use of his master, shall withdraw himself from his master and go away with such money, goods or other chattels, ... with intent to steal the same and defraud his master thereof, contrary to the trust and confidence in him reposed by his said master; or if any servant, being in the service of his master, without the assent of his master, shall embezzle such money, goods or other chattels, ... or otherwise convert the same to his own use, with like purpose to steal them, or to defraud his master thereof, the servant so offending shall be guilty of a felony . . .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For cases interpreting the statute, See State v. Canipe, 64 N.C. App. 102, 103, 306 S.E.2d 548, 549 (1983); State v. Brown, 56 N.C. App. 228, 229, 287 S.E.2d 421, 423 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Perkins notes, the purpose of the statute was not to create a new offence but was merely to confirm that the acts described in the statute met the elements of common law larceny.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Criminal Law 2d ed. (1986) at 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statute served the purpose of the then North Carolina colony as an [[indentured servitude|indentured servant]]– and slave-based [[political economy]]. It ensured that an indentured servant (or anyone bound to service of labour to a master, e.g., a slave), would owe to their master their labour; and, if they left their indentured service or bound labour unlawfully, the labour they produced, either for themselves (i.e., self-employed), or for anyone else, would be the converted goods that they unlawfully took, from the rightful owner, their master.

Crucially (and this can be seen as the purpose of the statute), any subsequent employer of such an indentured servant or slave, who was in fact bound to service of labour to a pre-existing master, would be chargeable with [[misprision of felony|misprision-of-a-felony]] (if it was proved in they knew that the employee was still indentured to a master, or owned as a slave); and chargeable as an accessory-after-the-fact, in the felony, with the servant or slave; in helping them, by employing them, in the unlawfully taking that which was lawfully bound (through the master servant relationship) in exclusive right, to the master of the indentured servant or slave.

==Methods of embezzlement==
Embezzlement sometimes involves falsification of records in order to conceal the activity. Embezzlers commonly secrete relatively small amounts repeatedly, in a systematic and/or methodical manner, over a long period of time, although some embezzlers secrete one large sum at once.  Some very successful embezzlement schemes have continued for many years before being detected due to the skill of the embezzler in concealing the nature of the transactions or their skill in gaining the trust and confidence of investors or clients, who are then reluctant to "test" the embezzler's trustworthiness by forcing a withdrawal of funds.

Embezzling should not be confused with skimming, which is under-reporting [[income]] and pocketing the difference. For example, in 2005, several managers of the service provider [[Aramark]] were found to be under-reporting profits from a string of [[vending machine]] locations in the eastern United States.  While the amount stolen from each machine was relatively small, the total amount taken from many machines over a length of time was very large. A smart technique employed by many small-time embezzlers can be covered by falsifying the records. (Example, by removing a small amount of money and falsifying the record the register would be technically correct, while the manager would remove the profit and leave the float in, this method would effectively make the register short for the next user and throw the blame onto them)

Another method is to create a false vendor account and supply false [[Bill (payment)|bill]]s to the company being embezzled so that the checks that are cut appear completely legitimate. Yet another method is to create phantom employees, who are then paid with payroll checks.

The latter two methods should be uncovered by routine audits, but often aren't if the audit is not sufficiently in-depth, because the paperwork appears to be in order. A publicly traded company must change auditors and audit companies every five years. The first method is easier to detect if all transactions are by cheque or other instrument, but if many transactions are in cash, it is much more difficult to identify. Employers have developed a number of strategies to deal with this problem. In fact, [[cash register]]s were invented just for this reason.

Some of the most complex (and potentially most lucrative) forms of embezzlement involve [[Ponzi scheme|Ponzi-like]] financial schemes where high returns to early investors are paid out of funds received from later investors duped into believing they are themselves receiving entry into a high-return investment scheme. The [[Madoff investment scandal]] is an example of this kind of high-level embezzlement scheme, where it is alleged that $65 billion was siphoned off from gullible investors and financial institutions.

==Safeguards against embezzlement==
[[Internal control]]s such as [[separation of duties]] are common defences against embezzlement. For example, at a movie theatre (cinema), the task of accepting money and admitting customers into the theatre is typically broken up into two jobs. One employee sells the ticket, and another employee takes the ticket and lets the customer into the theatre. Because a ticket cannot be printed without entering the sale into the computer (or, in earlier times, without using up a serial-numbered printed ticket), and the customer cannot enter the theatre without a ticket, both of these employees would have to collude in order for embezzlement to go undetected. This significantly reduces the chance of theft, because of the added difficulty in arranging such a conspiracy and the likely need to split the proceeds between the two employees, which reduces the payoff for each.

Another obvious method to deter embezzlement is to regularly and unexpectedly move funds from one advisor or entrusted person to another when the funds are supposed to be available for withdrawal or use, to ensure that the ''full amount'' of the funds is available and no fraction of the savings has been embezzled by the person to whom the funds or savings have been entrusted.

==England and Wales==
Offences of embezzlement were formerly created by sections 18 and 19 of the [[Larceny Act 1916]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Larceny Act 1916|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1916/50/enacted|journal=http://www.legislation.gov.uk|date = 31 October 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former offences of embezzlement are replaced by the new offence of theft, contrary to section 1 of the [[Theft Act 1968]].&lt;ref&gt;Griew, Edward. The Theft Acts 1968 and 1978. Sweet and Maxwell. Fifth Edition. 1986. Paragraph 2-01 at page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

King Philip V of Spain suffers from mental troubles which have made his counsellors deem him unfit to rule. As the play opens, he is seen fishing for his pet goldfish in a large brandy glass, then panicking when his Queen and second wife, the Italian Isabella Farnese, lights some candles, and extinguishing them with the water from the goldfish glass. Isabella travels to London, where she hears the famous castrato Farinelli sing and gets the idea that the inspiring and soothing power of his music could help her husband emerge from depression. She asks the impresario Rich, producer of ''The Beggar’s Opera'', to present this proposal to Farinelli; he treats her contemptuously as just another crazed fan of Farinelli until she leaves and he reads her note and realizes to his horror that she really is the Queen of Spain.

Farinelli comes to Spain and to the court, and King Philip makes him prove who he is by asking him harsh questions. Farinelli reveals that it was his brother Riccardo who castrated him when he was ten to preserve his wonderful soprano voice, and answers yes to Philip’s blunt query as to whether he can have sex with a woman. (Men castrated solely for purposes of singing lost only their testicles, so this is true.) He then sings for Philip. (Whenever Farinelli is to sing on stage, an identically dressed man billed as The Singer comes out and does the singing; this aids casting in that a good actor and a wonderful countertenor singer are rarely found in the same body, but also helps a theme in the play that the man Farinelli looks at the super-celebrity singer Farinelli as a distinct other self.)

When Farinelli/The Singer has sung beautifully for the King, Philip’s chief counsellor and his doctor come in with a complex budget report and a document of abdication; if Philip cannot understand the budget report, they will get him to abdicate. Philip pages hastily through the budget report and suddenly makes incisive and brilliant comments on its omissions and mistakes. The music therapy has worked, and the abdication is shelved.

Farinelli continues to sing for Philip and Isabella, and the King continues to rule viably, but is still whimsical. He decides to go and live in the middle of the forest so that he can hear the stars singing. Farinelli and Isabella go with him, and Farinelli gives a concert in the woods, to which all the local villagers and forest-dwelling commoners come uninvited. The theater audience stands in for these spectators, Philip addressing some audience members as specific local characters, and Farinelli sings for all.

Farinelli and Queen Isabella develop feelings for each other, and Farinelli/The Singer sings her a love aria which is heartfelt and emotional rather than just brilliant and impressive like his earlier arias. They realize that they must get Philip to leave the forest. He does, lamenting that he had almost got to be able to hear the singing of the stars. He continues to be able to rule, and is last seen dressing in ceremonial armour and mounting an effigy of a horse to pose for an official portrait. Meanwhile, Isabella gets an opera house built in Madrid despite courtiers’ comments that opera will never succeed in Spain.

Rich, who has appeared from time to time commenting on developments in the theatrical and political world, meets Isabella again, no longer at court because Philip is dead and her hostile stepson is King. Farinelli is then seen in retirement in Bologna. His friend and tailor begs him to sing his greatest aria, Handel’s "Lascia ch’io pianga" (“Let me weep”), which is even more sincerely emotional than his outpouring to Isabella. As The Singer fills the theater with the beautiful sadness of the aria, Farinelli’s friend quietly leaves him alone. At the end, The Singer touches Farinelli affectionately and withdraws.

'''Fetal abduction''' refers to the rare crime of [[child abduction]] by murder of an at term pregnant mother and extraction of her fetus through a crude [[caesarean section|cesarean section]].&lt;ref name=Walters2017&gt;{{cite news|first1=Joanna|last1=Walters|title=Fetal abduction: brutal attacks against expectant mothers on the rise in US|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/02/fetal-abduction-attacks-expectant-mothers|agency=Guardian|date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the small number of reported cases, few pregnant victims and about half of their fetuses survived the assault and non-medically performed cesarean.

==Abductor profile==
Fetal abduction is usually perpetrated by a woman after organized planning. The abductor may befriend the pregnant victim. The abductor is so determined to impersonate a pregnant and puerperal mother that she may use weight gain and a prosthesis to fake a pregnancy and cut herself internally to make it look as if she has given birth. She may take the neonate to a hospital. The [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]’s spokesperson, Cathy Nahirny, stated in 2007, “Many times the abductor fakes a pregnancy and when it is time to deliver the baby, must abduct someone else's child”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6990419.stm |title= The women who kill for babies  |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |quote=A US jury has recommended the death penalty for a woman convicted of killing a pregnant stranger, cutting her abdomen open and stealing her unborn baby. |accessdate=11 October 2011 |first=Chris |last=Summers |date=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal motives include delusions of fulfilling a partner relationship, child-bearing and childbirth.&lt;ref name="Burgess2002"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Burgess AW, Baker T, Nahirny C, Rabun JB| title=Newborn kidnapping by cesarean section. | journal=J Forensic Sci | year= 2002 | volume= 47 | issue= 4 | pages= 827–30 | pmid=12136992 | doi= | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12136992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Marlene|last1=Dalley|title=Abductions from the womb : Caesarean section murder a new category of homicide|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pubs/omc-ned/caesar-cesarien-eng.pdf|website=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27805715"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Burgess AW, Dillon MA, Chiou KY, Hulsopple SB| title=Fetal Abduction: Comparison of Two Cases. | journal=J Psychosoc Nurs Ment Health Serv | year= 2016 | volume= 54 | issue= 11 | pages= 37–43 | pmid=27805715 | doi=10.3928/02793695-20161024-07 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27805715}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8426152"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Yutzy SH, Wolfson JK, Resnick PJ| title=Child stealing by cesarean section: a psychiatric case report and review of the child stealing literature. | journal=J Forensic Sci | year= 1993 | volume= 38 | issue= 1 | pages= 192–6 | pmid=8426152 | doi=10.1520/JFS13392J | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8426152  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
The [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] recorded 18 cases of fetal abductions in the United States between 1983 and 2015, which represented 6% of the recorded 302 cases of infant abduction.&lt;ref name=Walters2017 /&gt;

"Womb raiding" and "cesarean or [[in utero]] [[kidnapping]]" are media terms for fetal abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Paul|last1=Thompson|title='Serial womb raider' accused of cutting baby from mother's womb 'had baby snatch history'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1036712/Serial-womb-raider-accused-cutting-baby-mothers-womb-baby-snatch-history.html|agency=Mail Online|date=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of reported cases and attempts==
Of the current list of 25 reported cases (not including attempts), 4 of the mothers and 13 of their fetuses survived. (This list distinguishes an attempted fetal abduction as without either murder of the mother or extraction of the fetus. An attempt can include severe injury to the mother and fetus.)

====1974====
* In [[Philadelphia]] in November 1974, a 36-year-old woman named Winifred Ransom hacked and shot to death 26-year-old Margaret Sweeney. Sweeney was 8 months pregnant at the time. After first knocking Sweeney unconscious, Ransom cut the fetus out of Sweeney with a butcher knife. Sweeney regained consciousness during the operation, at which point Ransom struck her with a hatchet at least 20 times and then shot her 3 times. Ransom buried Sweeney beneath the floorboards of her kitchen. Ransom's husband eventually alerted authorities roughly 3 days later. Police found the body November 16. The baby girl survived and was cared for by her grandfather. Ransom was acquitted on the grounds of insanity. She was released from [[Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry|Byberry State Hospital]] mental institution after 20 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unknownmisandry.blogspot.com/2012/04/earliest-known-cesearean-kidnapping.html|title=The Unknown History of MISANDRY: Earliest Known Cesarean Kidnapping: Winifred Ransom, Perp / Margaret Sweeney, Victim – Pennsylvania 1974|first=St|last=Estephe|date=17 October 2011|website=Unknownmisandry.blogspot.com|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''First Ladies Summit''' was officially established in 2010, with [[Malaysia]] playing the inaugural host for this biennial event. It aims to gather [[First Lady|First Ladies]] around the world to support a global initiative to ensure a safe and sustainable future for the next generation. The theme of the [[Summit (meeting)|summit]] is "A Child Today, A Leader Tomorrow". Despite relatively lukewarm response, [[UN Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki Moon]] praised the inaugural First Ladies Summit for its efforts in securing the welfare of the children &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/15ros/Article/ UN chief praises first ladies initiative], [[New Straits Times]], 31 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meetings==
The meetings have been held in:
* First Ladies Summit 1: October 11–13, 2010, {{flagicon|MYS}} [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]

The original plan was to hold the summit every two years, but its future has been thrown into doubt following widespread criticism of its poor turnout. There is speculation that the event was merely an expensive publicity stunt thrown by [[Rosmah Mansor]] to justify her self-styled "First Lady of Malaysia" title — technically such a title cannot exist as Malaysia is a [[constitutional monarchy]], not a [[republic]]. Indeed, as of July 2012, there has been no further talk of hosting another summit.

==Participation==
15 first ladies, six representatives of First Ladies and 21 ministers turned up for the event. List of First Ladies who attended the Inaugural First Ladies Summit are listed as follows. The following list is conjured to be illustrative and not comprehensive.

# [[Teuta Topi]] ([[Republic of Albania]])
# Salomea Neves Aim Gomes ([[Guinea Bissau]])
# Ernestina Naadu Mills ([[Ghana]])
# Meme Tong ([[Kiribati]])
# Lorna Golding ([[Jamaica]])
# [[Keosaychay Sayasone]] ([[Laos]])
# [[Sarojini Jugnauth]] ([[Mauritius]])
# Maria De Luz Guebuza ([[Mozambique]])
# Patience Jonathan ([[Nigeria]])
# Mercedes Lugo De Maidana ([[Paraguay]])
# Natalie Brigitte Nadage Michel ([[Seychelles]])
# Sia Nyama Koroma ([[Sierra Leone]])
# [[Shiranthi Rajapaksa]] ([[Sri Lanka]])
# Thandiwe Banda ([[Zambia]])

== Controversies==
The summit sparked public outcry for its perceived poor attendance. Zuraida Kamaruddin, Member of Parliament for Ampang, criticized the perceived wastage of public funds amounting to 24 million [[ringgit]] which she claimed could be put to better use. In addition, [[Rosmah Mansor]]'s title as First Lady of Malaysia drew ire from certain public quarters, for such a status is not official in [[Malaysia]].

'''Good Friday processions in Baliuag'''  or '''Holy Week procession in [[Baliuag, Bulacan]]''' is an event taking place in [[Holy Week]], in a traditional Roman Catholic culture of the [[St. Augustine Parish Church of Baliuag]].

In the [[Philippines]], [[Good Friday]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The etymology of the term "good" in the context of Good Friday is contested. Some sources claim it is from the senses ''pious'', ''holy'' of the word "good",&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/good-friday |title=Good Friday &amp;#124; Easy to understand definition of Good Friday by Your Dictionary |publisher=Yourdictionary.com |date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others contend that it is a corruption of "[[God in Christianity|God]] Friday".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06643a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Good Friday |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 September 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[religious holiday]] observed primarily by Christians commemorating the [[crucifixion of Jesus Christ]] and his death at [[Calvary]]. The holiday is observed during [[Holy Week]] as part of the [[Paschal Triduum]] on the Friday preceding [[Easter Sunday]], and may coincide with the Jewish observance of [[Passover]]. It is also known as '''Holy Friday''', '''Great Friday''', '''Black Friday''',&lt;ref&gt;

Baliuag Good Friday processions like any other religious [[processions]] are found in almost every form of Christian and Catholic worship, such as [[Holy Week]] processions.

[[Group Captain]] '''Harry Melville Arbuthnot Day''' [[George Cross|GC]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (3 August 1898 – 11 March 1977) was a [[Royal Marine]] and later an [[RAF]] pilot during the [[Second World War]]. As a [[prisoner of war]], he was senior British officer in a number of camps and a noted escapee.

==Early life==

Day was born in [[Sarawak]] on [[Borneo]], and grew up there. His grandfather had been a [[major (United Kingdom)|major]] in the [[66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot|66th Foot]] before forming a [[private army]] for [[Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak|Charles Brooke]], the second [[White Rajahs|White Rajah]] of Sarawak, which became known as the [[Sarawak Rangers]]. Day's father joined the Rajah's service and became a Sarawak resident.&lt;ref name="Wings Day page 26"&gt;'Wings Day' by Sydney Smith page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's great-uncle was [[George Fiott Day]], who had won the [[Victoria Cross]] during the [[Crimean War]]. He is also a descendant of [[George Miller Bligh]], who was an officer on {{HMS|Victory}} during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].&lt;ref name="Wings Day page 26"/&gt;

Day was sent to England and was educated at [[Haileybury College]], where he joined the Officers Cadet Corps. Whilst on manoeuvres, he was wounded when shot in the back with a blank cartridge.

He joined the [[Royal Marines]] in 1916 and was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]].

==World War I==
Day served with a Royal Marine detachment on the [[battleship]] [[HMS Britannia (1904)|HMS ''Britannia'']].
 
On 9 November 1918, two days before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]], the ship was torpedoed and sunk. Day distinguished himself by twice returning below deck, through smoke and flames, to rescue two injured men trapped inside, including the wardroom steward. For this act of bravery, Day was awarded the [[Albert Medal (lifesaving)|Albert Medal]] (sea, second class).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31112|page=363|date=7 January 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, all Albert Medal holders became eligible to exchange their award for a [[George Cross]], which Day did.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gc-database.co.uk/exchanges.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter war years==

Day was promoted to lieutenant in 1919&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/31543/pages/11355&lt;/ref&gt; and his first command was with a marine detachment on [[HMS Isis (1896)|HMS ''Isis'']], an [[Eclipse class cruiser|''Eclipse''-class cruiser]], before joining [[HMS Malaya|HMS ''Malaya'']].

Later he commanded the marine detachment of [[HMS Caledon (D53)|HMS ''Caledon'']] at the [[Great Fire of Smyrna|burning of Smyrna]], helping to evacuate Greek survivors of the Turkish massacres. He also saw service with the fleet during the [[League of Nations]] involvement at [[Klaipėda Region|Memel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

He stayed with the Royal Marines until 1924, when he moved to the [[Fleet Air Arm]] as a [[flying officer]] serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] during the late 1920s before receiving a permanent commission in 1930 as a [[flight lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1930/untitled0%20-%200861.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33623|page=4273|date=7 January 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined [[No. 23 Squadron RAF]] flying [[Gloster Gamecock]]s, with which he led the RAF Synchronised Aerobatics Display Team, which included [[Douglas Bader]] at the 1931 Hendon Air Show,&lt;ref&gt;''Reach for the Sky'' by [[Paul Brickhill]], page 41&lt;/ref&gt; and other displays.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1931/1931%20-%200915.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He held posts at [[RAF Abu Sueir]] and [[Khartoum]], was promoted to [[squadron leader]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34311|page=5081|date=7 January 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; holding commands at [[RAF Aboukir|Aboukir]] and [[RAF Netheravon|Netheravon]] before commanding the Advanced Flying Training School at [[RAF Little Rissington|Little Rissington]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wire &amp; Walls'' by [[Charles Rollings]], page 246&lt;/ref&gt;

When war was imminent he was promised a staff job at [[RAF Bomber Command]] headquarters, but he requested to join an operational squadron. This was approved, and in July 1939 he was promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1939/1939-1-%20-%200033.html&lt;/ref&gt; and placed in command of [[No. 57 Squadron RAF|57 Squadron]], stationed at [[RAF Upper Heyford]].

==World War II==

Day was over 40 when World War II began, and with No. 57 Squadron he moved to [[Metz]] as part of the air component of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]], equipped with the [[Bristol Blenheim]] light bomber.&lt;ref&gt;''Wire &amp; Walls'' by [[Charles Rollings]], page 67&lt;/ref&gt; He volunteered to carry out the squadron's first operational mission, a flight from Metz to reconnoitre Hamm-Hannover-Soest on 13 October 1939. His Blenheim, ''L1138'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostaircraft.com/database.php?mode=viewentry&amp;e=10538 Record for ''Blenheim L1138'' on ''lostaircraft.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; was shot down by a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Me109]] flown by ''Unteroffizier'' Stephan Lutjens, of 11./[[JG 53]] near [[Birkenfeld]]. Day bailed out, suffering burns to his face and hands, but otherwise landed safely by [[parachute]]. He was immediately captured by the Germans and placed in the custody of ''Luftwaffe'' doctor [[Hermann Gauch]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigfrid Gauch, ''Traces of my Father'', Northwestwern University Press, pp. 81–2.&lt;/ref&gt; His two crew-mates, Sergeant E.B. Hillier and AC1 F.G. Moller were killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith, page 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''RAF Bomber Command Losses 1939–40'', WR Chorley, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prisoner of war==

Upon his capture, Day became a [[prisoner of war]]. He spent a few days at a German Army hospital having his burns treated before spending two weeks at a small camp at Oberursel (which later became known as [[Dulag Luft]]). He was then sent to [[Oflag IX-A/H]] at [[Spangenberg]], arriving there at the end of October.&lt;ref&gt;''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; He took over the role of senior British officer at this camp and became responsible for the well-being of the handful of British [[RAF]] prisoners who had entered captivity so early in the war. Day, with six RAF and five French POWs, left Oflag IX-A/H in December 1939 to be sent to [[Dulag Luft]] near [[Oberursel (Taunus)|Oberursel]] to become a 'permanent' staff at this new transit camp.

===Dulag Luft===

Day, again due to his seniority in rank, held the post of senior British officer and also headed the permanent staff whose job was to help newly captured aircrew adapt to life as prisoners of war.

Until the [[Norwegian Campaign]] began in April 1940, very few prisoners entered the camp, and life was fairly relaxed. Day got on well with the German commandant, Major Rumpel. The permanent staff were also allowed out on parole walk and enjoyed ample [[Red Cross]] food and a good relationship with the German guards. This 'privileged friendliness' caused suspicion with newly captured RAF aircrew who passed through the camp, and many accusations of collaboration were made against Day and his other colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith, page 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, Day had been sending intelligence back home in coded letters, and together with other members of the permanent staff, including [[Roger Bushell]], [[Jimmy Buckley]] and [[Johnnie Dodge]], he had been active in construction of a tunnel, starting from under his bed, which was completed in the spring of 1941.&lt;ref&gt;''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith, page 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dulag Luft escape===

In June 1941, Day and 17 others tunnelled out of the camp. This was the first [[Mass escapes from German POW camps|mass escape]] of the war. Day travelled on foot alone, aiming to walk down the [[Moselle Valley]] and into France, but was recaptured five days later, looking like a tramp.&lt;ref&gt;''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith page 77&lt;/ref&gt; All the escapers were recaptured and after spending a few days in jail at [[Frankfurt am Main]], were transferred to [[Stalag Luft I]].&lt;ref&gt;WO208/3269 Official Camp History – Dulag Luft Chapter II Para 24&lt;/ref&gt; Major Rumpel congratulated Day on his attempt.&lt;ref&gt;'Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stalag Luft I===

Day arrived at Stalag Luft I in July 1941 and immediately took over the role of senior British officer. Any suspicions felt about Day from his time at Dulag Luft were quickly dissolved when the other inmates of the camp learnt of his exploits. At this camp, Day set up an escape organisation, headed by [[Jimmy Buckley]], by which all escape attempts, intelligence gathering and escape preparations were controlled. This organisation became the model used at all other allied POW camps for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref&gt;AIR40/1489 – Letter of Recommendation by [[Herbert Massey]] dated 4/7/45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Escape from Germany'' by [[Aidan Crawley]], page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Day partly oversaw a mass escape attempt in August 1941 when 12 officers tried to escape using a tunnel; however, the escape was discovered as the third person left the exit, and all three escapers were recaptured.&lt;ref&gt;WO208/3282 Official Camp History – SL1 – Chapter II para 24&lt;/ref&gt; When this camp was closed in March 1942, Day and all RAF inmates were transferred to the east compound at the newly built [[Stalag Luft III]] at [[Żagań|Sagan]].

===Stalag Luft III===

Here he made a second escape attempt using a forged interpreter's pass. While in solitary confinement after that attempt, he tried a third escape but was again recaptured.

===Oflag XXI-B===

In October 1942, he was sent to [[Oflag XXI-B]] at [[Schubin]] where in March 1943 he escaped through the latrine tunnel with [[William Ash (pilot)|William Ash]], [[Peter Stevens (pilot)|Peter Stevens]], [[Aidan Crawley]] and others. This time Day headed east to Poland, hoping to get on a ship to Sweden. He was recaptured and sent back to Schubin, before being transferred back to Sagan.

===Stalag Luft III and the Great Escape===

Together with [[Roger Bushell]], he planned and organised the [[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|"Great Escape"]]. On 24 March 1944, Day and 75 others escaped and he made his way to [[Szczecin|Stettin]]. Disguised as a British colonel under guard by another escapee (Pavel Tobolski), who was dressed as a German soldier, they travelled by train, through Berlin, reaching Stettin on the evening of the next day. There they sought help from some French workers and were taken to a workers' camp. However, they were betrayed by an informer in the camp and arrested the following day.

After a brief stay in the local jail, Day was taken to Berlin and was interviewed by [[Arthur Nebe]], the man who selected the 50 escapers to be murdered, which included Tobolski.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/externalrequest.asp?requestreference=AIR40/2645 AIR 40/2645 Official Camp History – Stalag Luft III Part III Chapter II Para 24b], [[The National Archives]]&lt;/ref&gt; Day was spared execution.  Day later said that Hitler had ordered his execution personally, but that Hermann Goering had asked him to relent because Day and his family were so well known to the public.

===Sachsenhausen concentration camp===

After interrogation by the Gestapo, he was sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], from where he and four others (including three survivors from the Great Escape) managed another tunnel escape. After another visit to [[Gestapo]] headquarters, he was held in solitary confinement in the death cells at Sachsenhausen.

===Hostage in Tyrol===

In February 1945, he was transferred to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] via [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenburg]]. In April 1945, he was [[Transport of concentration camp inmates to Tyrol|transferred to Tyrol]] together with other prominent prisoners. He made one final escape attempt in the final weeks of the war when the prisoners had limited freedom within the city limits while being held in [[Niederdorf, South Tyrol|Villa Bassa (now Niederdorf)]]. On 28 April, Day stole a [[Volkswagen]] and drove to the Allied lines where he informed the Allied Forces of the hostage situation in Tyrol. However, the following day, one of the German prisoners, Colonel [[Bogislaw von Bonin|von Bonin]], telephoned Captain [[Wichard von Alvensleben]] in nearby [[Bolzano|Bozen]], asking him to send his ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' unit to Villa Bassa to protect the prisoners from the [[SS]] guards. The ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' troops freed the hostages on 30 April after forcing their guards to flee.

For his services while a prisoner, Day was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]]. He was also awarded the United States [[Legion of Merit]] (Officer Class) for his services to American [[POW]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37639|supp=y|page=3445|date=7 January 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

Day was promoted to [[group captain]] in 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37479|supp=y|page=1076|date=7 January 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; before retiring from service in 1950.

He acted as technical adviser for the films [[Reach for the Sky (1956 film)|''Reach for the Sky'']]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049665/fullcredits&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Great Escape (film)|''The Great Escape'']].&lt;ref name="Walls page 246"&gt;''Wires and Walls'' by [[Charles Rollings]], page 246&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith (Squadron Leader Eric Sydney-Smith RAF) is an account of Day's exploits as a prisoner of war. Sydney-Smith was also a POW and was held with Day for several years.

Day also heavily features in the biography of [[Douglas Bader]] ''Reach for the Sky'' by [[Paul Brickhill]] and [[The Great Escape (book)|''The Great Escape'']], also by Brickhill.

He was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in November 1961.

Married to Margo, Day lived mainly in the Isle of Wight or at 6 Trevor Square, London. He died in the Blue Sisters Hospital, [[Malta]], on 11 March 1977, aged 78.&lt;ref name="Walls page 246"/&gt;

'''Henry Reed Rathbone''' (July 1, 1837 – August 14, 1911) was a [[United States]] [[Military of the United States|military]] officer and [[Diplomacy|diplomat]] who was present at the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Rathbone was sitting with his [[fiancée]], [[Clara Harris]], next to the President and his wife, [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], when [[John Wilkes Booth]] entered the president's [[box (theatre)|box]] at [[Ford's Theatre]] and fatally shot Lincoln in the head. When Rathbone attempted to prevent Booth from fleeing the scene, Booth stabbed and seriously wounded him.

==Early life==
Henry Rathbone was born in [[Albany, New York]], one of four children of Jared L. Rathbone, a merchant and wealthy businessman, who later became Albany's mayor, and Pauline Rathbone (née Penney).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essex Institute Historical Collections|year=1891|publisher=Essex Institute Press|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his father's death in 1845, Rathbone inherited the very considerable sum of two hundred thousand dollars. His widowed mother, Pauline Rathbone, married [[Ira Harris]] in 1848. Ira Harris was appointed [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from New York after [[William H. Seward]] became President Lincoln's [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Harris was a widower with four children whose wife Louisa had also died in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seward|first=Frances Adeline |editor=Johnson, Patricia Carley |title=Sensitivity and Civil War, the Selected Diaries and Papers, 1858–1866, of Frances Adeline (Fanny) Seward|volume=2|year=1963|publisher=University of Rochester|page=719}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ham|first=Mrs. Thomas H. |title=A Genealogy Of the Descendants Of Nicholas Harris, M.D.,|year=1904|publisher=C.I.F. Ham|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this marriage, Ira Harris became Rathbone's [[stepfather]] and his daughter, [[Clara Harris|Clara]], became Rathbone's [[stepsister]].

The two became engaged shortly before the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-08-21/entertainment/9408210103_1_henry-and-clara-henry-rathbone-thomas-mallon|title=Henry And Clara's Cruel Fate|last=Pappas|first=Theodore|date=August 21, 1994|publisher=chicagotribune.com|page=1|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rathbone studied law at [[Union College]] and briefly worked in a law partnership in Albany before entering the [[Union Army]] at the start of Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=John D.|title=The Routledge Encyclopedia of Civil War Era Biographies|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-136-33150-6|page=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Rathbone served as [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] in the [[12th Infantry Regiment (United States)|12th Infantry Regiment]] and was at the [[Battle of Antietam]] and the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. &lt;ref name=washpost&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=The Washington Post|last=Ruane|first=Michael E.|title=A Tragedy's Second Act|date=5 April 2009|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032701576.html|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the war's end, he had attained the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]].

===Lincoln assassination===
{{Main|Abraham Lincoln assassination}}
On April 14, 1865, Major Rathbone and his fiancee Clara Harris accepted an invitation to see a play at [[Ford's Theatre]] from President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his wife, First Lady [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. The couple, who had been friends with the President and his wife for some time, were invited after [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and his wife [[Julia Grant|Julia]], [[Thomas Eckert]], and several others had declined Mrs. Lincoln's invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steers|first=Edward |title=Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-813-19151-3|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Wilkes Booth dagger.jpg|thumb|left|Dagger used by Booth to attack Rathbone.]]

During the play, noted stage actor [[John Wilkes Booth]] surreptitiously entered the Presidential box and fatally shot Lincoln in the head with a pistol. As Rathbone attempted to apprehend Booth, Booth slashed Rathbone's left arm with a [[dagger]] from the elbow to his shoulder. Rathbone later recalled that he was horrified at the anger on Booth's face.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVLM0BSqx5o What Booth Said After He Killed Lincoln]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lachman&gt;{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Charles |title=The Last Lincolns: The Rise &amp; Fall of a Great American Family|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|isbn=1-402-75890-1|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hatch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatch|first=Frederick |title=Protecting President Lincoln: The Security Effort, the Thwarted Plots, and the Disaster at Ford's Theatre|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-46362-7|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the sill of the box. He grabbed onto Booth's coat, causing Booth to fall awkwardly to the stage, perhaps breaking his leg. Booth nonetheless escaped, and remained at large for twelve days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Mark|title=History of Criminal Justice|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=1-437-73497-9|pages=274–275|author2=Johnstone, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kauffman|first=Michael W.|title=American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies|year=2007|publisher=Random House LLC|isbn=0-307-43061-8|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his serious wound, Rathbone escorted Mary Lincoln to the [[Petersen House (Washington, D.C.)|Petersen House]] across the street, where the president had been taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reck|first=Waldo Emerson|title=A. Lincoln, His Last 24 Hours|year=1987|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-899-50216-4|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly thereafter he passed out due to blood loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bain|first=Robert T.|title=Lincoln's Last Battleground: A Tragic Night Recalled|year=2005|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=1-467-02991-2|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Harris arrived soon after and held his head in her lap while he lay semiconscious. When a surgeon who had been attending Lincoln finally examined him, it was realized that his wound was more serious than initially thought. Booth had cut him nearly to the bone and severed an artery. Rathbone was taken home while Harris remained with Mary Lincoln as Abraham lay dying over the next nine hours.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman (2007) p.37&lt;/ref&gt; This death vigil lasted through the night, until morning, when President Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How Did Lincoln Die?|journal=American Heritage|date=February–March 1995|volume=46|issue=1|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/how-did-lincoln-die?page=show|author=Richard A. R. Fraser, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic career and mental decline==
Although Rathbone's physical wounds healed, his mental state deteriorated in the years following Lincoln's death as he anguished over his perceived inability to thwart the assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/national-geographic-channel/all-videos/av-10989-11189/ngc-the-conspirator/ "The Conspirator: The Plot to Kill Lincoln"], [[National Geographic Channel]]. Retrieved 18 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He married Harris on July 11, 1867, and the couple had three children: [[Henry Riggs Rathbone|Henry Riggs]] (born February 12, 1870), who later became a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]]), Gerald Lawrence (born August 26, 1871), and Clara Pauline (born September 15, 1872).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Talcott|first=Sebastian V.|title=Genealogical Notes of New York and New England Families|year=2001|publisher=Heritage Books|isbn=0-788-41956-0|page=637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rathbone resigned from the Army in 1870, having risen to the rank of brevet [[colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jampoler|first=Andrew C. A.|title=The Last Lincoln Conspirator: John Surratt's Flight from the Gallows|year=2008|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=1-591-14407-8|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his resignation, he struggled to find and keep a job due to his mental instability. He became convinced that Harris was unfaithful. He also resented the attention Harris paid their children and reportedly threatened his wife on several occasions after suspecting that she was going to divorce him and take the children.&lt;ref name="hatch"/&gt; Nonetheless, President [[Chester A. Arthur]] appointed Rathbone as the U.S. Consul to the [[Province of Hanover]] in 1882. The family relocated to Germany, where Rathbone's mental health continued to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steers|first=Edward |title=The Lincoln Assassination Encyclopedia|year=2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-061-98705-0|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 1883, Rathbone attacked his children in a fit of madness. Rathbone fatally shot and stabbed his wife, who was attempting to protect the children. Rathbone then stabbed himself five times in the chest in an attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swanson|first=James L. |title=Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase to Catch Lincoln's Killer|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-061-80397-9|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with murder but was declared insane by doctors after blaming the murder on an intruder. He was convicted and committed to an asylum for the criminally insane in [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]]. The couple's children were sent to live with their uncle, William Harris, in the United States.&lt;ref name="hatch"/&gt;

==Final years and death==
Rathbone spent the rest of his life in the asylum. He died on August 14, 1911, and was buried next to his wife in the city cemetery at [[Hanover]]/Engesohde.&lt;ref name="hatch"/&gt; As time passed, the cemetery management, looking over records concerning plots without recent activity or family interest, decided in 1952 that both sets of remains could be exhumed and disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Gene|date=February–March 1994|title=The Haunted Major|journal=American Heritage|volume=45|issue=1|page=2|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/haunted-major?page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3656">'''IndigNation''' was [[Singapore]]'s annual, month-long lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer pride season, first held in August 2005 to coincide with the republic's 40th [[National Day]].

==Background==
IndigNation begun as a series of [[LGBT]]-themed events meant to fill in the gap that Singapore's banning of the [[Nation parties]] created. With the promise that Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] made in August 2004, allowing indoor talks to proceed ahead without a license from the police, it was an ideal time to organize talks, workshops, and related events as part of the line-up for IndigNation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sg.asia-city.com/city-living/article/brief-history-gay-movement-singapore |title=A brief history of the gay movement in Singapore |publisher=SG Magazine |accessdate=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infarction''' is tissue death ([[necrosis]]) due to inadequate blood supply to the affected area. It may be caused by artery blockages, rupture, mechanical compression, or vasoconstriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3970 |work=MedicineNet |publisher=[[WebMD]] |title=Definition of Infarction |date=April 27, 2011 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[lesion]] is referred to as an infarct&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/infarct |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]] |title=infarct}} Citing:

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
Infarction occurs as a result of prolonged [[ischemia]], which is the insufficient supply of oxygen and nutrition to an area of tissue due to a disruption in blood supply. The blood vessel supplying the affected area of tissue may be blocked due to an obstruction in the vessel (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;an [[arterial embolus]], [[thrombus]], or [[atherosclerotic plaque]]), compressed by something outside of the vessel causing it to narrow (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[tumor]], [[volvulus]], or [[hernia]]), ruptured by trauma causing a loss of blood pressure downstream of the rupture, or vasoconstricted, which is the narrowing of the blood vessel by contraction of the muscle wall rather than an external force (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;cocaine vasoconstriction leading to [[myocardial infarction]]).[[File:Endo dysfunction Athero.PNG|200px|thumbnail|left|Infarction could be caused by damaged cholesterol plaque]]

[[Hypertension]] and [[atherosclerosis]] are risk factors for both [[atherosclerotic plaque]]s and [[thromboembolism]]. In atherosclerotic formations, a plaque develops under a fibrous cap. When the fibrous cap is degraded by metalloproteinases released from macrophages or by intravascular shear force from blood flow, subendothelial thrombogenic material ([[extracellular matrix]]) is exposed to circulating platelets and thrombus formation occurs on the vessel wall [[Vascular occlusion|occluding]] blood flow. Occasionally, the plaque may rupture and form an [[Embolism|embolus]] which travels with the blood-flow downstream to where the vessel narrows and eventually clogs the vessel lumen.

==Classification==
[[File:InfarctPandLbasilarsegmentsPE.PNG|thumb|Infarction of the lung due to a pulmonary embolism]]

===By histopathology===
[[File:Thrombosis.png|200px|thumbnail|left|A blood clot could be a broken thrombosis that got clotted to the blood vessel wall.]]
Infarctions are divided into two types according to the amount of [[blood]] present:
# [[White infarction]]s ([[anemic infarct]]s) affect solid organs such as the [[spleen]], [[heart]] and [[kidneys]] wherein the solidity of the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] substantially limits the amount of nutrients ([[blood]]/[[oxygen]]/[[glucose]]/[[fuel]]) that can flow into the [[area]] of [[ischaemic]] [[necrosis]]. Similar [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] to [[blood flow]] and consequent [[necrosis]] can occur as a result of severe [[vasoconstriction]] as illustrated in severe [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] that can lead to irreversible [[gangrene]].
# [[Red infarction]]s ([[hemorrhagic infarct]]s) generally affect the [[lung]]s or other loose organs ([[testis]], [[ovary]], [[small intestines]]). The [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] consists more of [[red blood cell]]s and [[fibrin]] strands. Characteristics of red infarcts include:
#* occlusion of a [[vein]]
#* loose tissues that allow [[blood]] to collect in the [[infarcted]] zone

===By localization===
* '''Heart''': [[Myocardial infarction]] (''MI''), commonly known as a ''heart attack'', is an infarction of the heart, causing some heart cells to die. This is most commonly due to occlusion (blockage) of a [[coronary artery]] following the rupture of a [[Vulnerable plaque|vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque]], which is an unstable collection of [[lipids]] (fatty acids) and [[white blood cell]]s (especially [[macrophage]]s) in the wall of an [[artery]]. The resulting [[ischemia]] (restriction in blood supply) and [[Hypoxia (medical)|oxygen shortage]], if left untreated for a sufficient period of time, can cause damage or death of heart muscle tissue (''[[myocardium]]'').
* '''Brain''': [[Cerebral infarction]] is the [[ischemia|ischemic]] kind of [[stroke]] due to a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain. It can be atherothrombotic or embolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ropper |first1=Allan H. |last2=Adams |first2=Raymond Delacy |last3=Brown |first3=Robert F. |last4=Victor |first4=Maurice |title=Adams and Victor's principles of neurology |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical Pub. Division |location=New York  |isbn=0-07-141620-X |pages=686–704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stroke caused by cerebral infarction should be distinguished from two other kinds of stroke: [[cerebral hemorrhage]] and  [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]. Cerebral infarctions vary in their severity with one third of the cases resulting in death.
* '''Lung''': Pulmonary infarction or [[lung Infarction|lung infarction]]
* '''Spleen''': [[Splenic infarction]] occurs when the [[splenic artery]] or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a [[blood clot]]. Although it can occur [[asymptomatic]]ally, the typical symptom is severe [[abdominal pain|pain]] in the [[left upper quadrant (abdomen)|left upper quadrant of the abdomen]], sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. Fever and chills develop in some cases.&lt;ref name="pmid9486895"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9486895 |year=1998 |last1=Nores |first1=M |last2=Phillips |first2=EH |last3=Morgenstern |first3=L |last4=Hiatt |first4=JR |title=The clinical spectrum of splenic infarction |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=182–8 |journal=The American surgeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has to be differentiated from other causes of [[acute abdomen]].
* '''Limb''': [[Limb infarction]] is an infarction of an [[arm]] or [[leg]]. Causes include [[arterial embolism]]s and ''skeletal muscle infarction'' as a rare complication of long standing, poorly controlled [[diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10782838 |year=2000 |last1=Grigoriadis |first1=E |last2=Fam |first2=AG |last3=Starok |first3=M |last4=Ang |first4=LC |title=Skeletal muscle infarction in diabetes mellitus |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=1063–8 |journal=The Journal of Rheumatology}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major presentation is painful thigh or leg swelling.&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis/&gt;
* '''Bone''': Infarction of [[bone]] results in [[avascular necrosis]]. Without blood, the bone tissue dies and the bone collapses.&lt;ref name=DiGiovanni&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17426292 |year=2007 |last1=Digiovanni |first1=CW |last2=Patel |first2=A |last3=Calfee |first3=R |last4=Nickisch |first4=F |title=Osteonecrosis in the foot |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=208–17 |journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons}}&lt;/ref&gt; If avascular necrosis involves the bones of a [[joint]], it often leads to destruction of the joint articular surfaces (see [[osteochondritis dissecans]]).
* '''Testicle''': an infarction of a [[testicle]] may be caused by [[testicular torsion]].

[[File:Segmental testicular infarction 112914968.jpg|thumb|Ultrasound of segmental testicular infarction. Infarct area shown as hypoechoic and avascular upper segment of R testis.]]

* '''Eye''': an infarction can occur to the [[central retinal artery]] which supplies the retina causing sudden visual loss.

==Associated diseases==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Diseases commonly associated with infarctions include:

* [[Peripheral artery occlusive disease]] (the most severe form of which is [[gangrene]])
* [[Antiphospholipid syndrome]]
* [[Sepsis]]
* [[Giant-cell arteritis]] (GCA)
* [[Hernia]]
* [[Volvulus]]
* [[Sickle-cell disease]]

The hoax was arranged by Tarandeep Gill, a web developer from [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=sawersTNW&gt;Paul Sawers.

The study was presented as measuring how IQ affects choices to adopt new technologies.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

Gill says he got the idea for the hoax about a month prior to its release&lt;ref name=sawersTNW/&gt; when working on his website.  "IE6 compatibility was being a pain in the ass," he told ''[[ReadWriteWeb]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John Paul Titlow. [http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_the_internet_explorer_iq_study_hoax_spread_and_why.php "Disgruntled Canadian Developer Behind Internet Explorer IQ "Study" Hoax".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927072316/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_the_internet_explorer_iq_study_hoax_spread_and_why.php# |date=2011-09-27 }} ''[[ReadWriteWeb]]'', 8/3/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Googletrends IE IQ hoax.png|thumb|[[Google Search]] traffic for the terms &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;'''aptiquant'''&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;'''browser iq'''&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:orange;"&gt;'''internet explorer iq'''&lt;/span&gt; between July 28 and August 4.]]
The report was covered by many news outlets. Initially the discrepancy was explained by that the advanced computer users with high IQs were savvy enough to choose other browsers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/8674678/Internet-Explorer-users-have-below-average-IQ.html "Internet Explorer users 'have below-average IQ'".] ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 8/1/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the report was first covered by the [[BBC]] some readers were skeptical of its authenticity and quickly noted that the domain for the company had only been set up a month prior and that pictures of the company's staff were from the French company [[Central Test]]. Central Test began investigating the issue and said it was considering legal action against whomever had used the photos.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Gross.

[http://www.pcworld.com/article/237160/internet_explorer_iq_story_called_a_hoax.html "Internet Explorer IQ Story Called a Hoax".] ''[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]]'', 8/3/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The address given on the website was looked up using [[Google Street View]] and it turned out to be just a parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Brewster.

While the story was being covered Gill posed as Leonard Howard, the fabricated owner of AptiQuant, to the media.&lt;ref&gt;Lahmeik Stacey. [http://digitaljournal.com/article/309759 "Web browser, IQ study discovered to be hoax".] ''Digital Journal'', 7/31/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a blog on the AptiQuant website about how they were being sued by Internet Explorer users&lt;ref&gt;[http://technology.iafrica.com/technews/744645.html "IE users are dumb - study".] ''[[iAfrica]]'', 8/2/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/technology&amp;id=8285420 "IE users sue company over browser IQ test".] ''[[KGO-TV]]'', 8/2/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and that it had been receiving hate mail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lfpress.com/tech/news/2011/08/01/18496436.html "Internet Explorer 6 users criticized in study".] ''[[London Free Press]]'', 8/1/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet Explorer users acted defensively.&lt;ref&gt;Robert X. Cringely. [http://www.infoworld.com/t/cringely/microsoft-and-ie-time-its-personal-168822?page=0,1 "Microsoft and IE: This time it's personal".] ''[[InfoWorld]]', 8/3/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some news outlets criticized the methodology of the study, although without realizing it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;Machlis Musings. [http://blogs.computerworld.com/18734/what_ie_users_are_dumb_study_really_shows_us "What the 'IE users are dumb' hoax really shows us".] ''[[Computer World]]'', 8/3/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was even described as "Junk science at its worst".&lt;ref&gt;Steve Evans. "Internet Explorer 'low IQ' findings a hoax?". ''[[Computer Business Review]]'', 3/8/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some defended the study; for example, ''[[The Register]]'' wrote, "The methodology of the study appears sound."&lt;ref name=theregister/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The hoax coverage was said by some to be a victory for citizen journalism, as it was readers who first uncovered that it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;Johnathan Hartwood.

Confinement at high stocking density is one part of a systematic effort to produce the highest output at the lowest cost by relying on [[economies of scale]], modern machinery, [[biotechnology]], and [[Globalization|global trade]]. There are differences in the way factory farming techniques are practiced around the world. There is a continuing debate over the benefits, risks and ethical questions of factory farming.

==History==
The practice of industrial animal agriculture is a relatively recent development in the [[history of agriculture]], and the result of scientific discoveries and technological advances. Innovations in agriculture beginning in the late 19th century generally parallel developments in [[mass production]] in other industries that characterized the latter part of the [[Industrial Revolution]].   The discovery of [[vitamin]]s and their role in animal [[nutrition]], in the first two decades of the 20th century, led to vitamin supplements, which allowed chickens to be raised indoors.&lt;ref name="John Steele Gordon 1996"&gt;[[John Steele Gordon]] (1996) "The Chicken Story", American Heritage, September 1996: 52–67&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of [[antibiotic]]s and [[vaccine]]s facilitated raising livestock in larger numbers by reducing disease. Chemicals developed for use in [[World War II]] gave rise to synthetic [[pesticide]]s. Developments in shipping networks and technology have made long-distance distribution of agricultural produce feasible.

Agricultural production across the world doubled four times between 1820 and 1975 (1820 to 1920; 1920 to 1950; 1950 to 1965; and 1965 to 1975) to feed a global population of one billion human beings in 1800 and 6.5 billion in 2002.&lt;ref name=dominion&gt;Matthew Scully  [https://books.google.com/books/about/Dominion.html?id=4lSplJlgc_sC Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy] Macmillan, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}}  During the same period, the number of people involved in farming dropped as the process became more automated. In the 1930s, 24 percent of the American population worked in agriculture compared to 1.5 percent in 2002; in 1940, each farm worker supplied 11 consumers, whereas in 2002, each worker supplied 90 consumers.&lt;ref name=dominion/&gt;{{rp|29}}

According to the [[BBC]], the era factory farming per se in Britain began in 1947 when a new Agriculture Act granted subsidies to farmers to encourage greater output by introducing new technology, in order to reduce Britain's reliance on imported meat. The United Nations writes that "intensification of animal production was seen as a way of providing food security."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unsystem.org/SCN/archives/scnnews21/ch04.htm#TopOfPage "The History of Factory Farming"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116060714/http://www.unsystem.org/SCN/archives/scnnews21/ch04.htm |date=November 16, 2013 }}, United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, the United States, United Kingdom and other industrialized nations, commenced factory farming of beef and dairy cattle and domestic pigs.&lt;ref name="Danielle Nierenburg 2005"/&gt;  From its American and West European heartland factory farming became globalised in the later years of the 20th century and is still expanding and replacing traditional practices of stock rearing in an increasing number of countries.&lt;ref name="Danielle Nierenburg 2005"&gt;Danielle Nierenburg (2005) ''Happier Meals: Rethinking the Global Meat Industry''. Worldwatch Paper 171: 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 factory farming accounted for 30% of world meat production and by 2005 this had risen to 40%.&lt;ref name="Danielle Nierenburg 2005"/&gt;

==Contemporary animal production==

Factory farms hold large numbers of animals, typically cows, pigs, turkeys, or chickens, often indoors, typically at high densities. The aim of the operation is to produce large quantities of meat, eggs, or milk at the lowest possible cost. Food is supplied in place.  Methods employed to maintain health and improve production may include some combination of disinfectants, antimicrobial agents, anthelmintics, hormones and vaccines;  protein, mineral and vitamin supplements; frequent health inspections; biosecurity; climate-controlled facilities and other measures.  Physical restraints, e.g. fences or creeps, are used to control movement or actions regarded as undesirable. Breeding programs are used to produce animals more suited to the confined conditions and able to provide a consistent food product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/669754727|title=Eating Animals.|date=2010|publisher=Hachette Book Group USA|others=Foer, Jonathan Safran|isbn=9780316127165|oclc=669754727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intensive production of livestock and poultry is widespread in [[developed nation]]s. For 2002-2003, [[FAO]] estimates of industrial production as a percentage of global production were 7 percent for beef and veal, 0.8 percent for sheep and goat meat, 42 percent for pork, and 67 percent for poultry meat.  Industrial production was estimated to account for 39 percent of the sum of global production of these meats and 50 percent of total egg production.&lt;ref&gt;FAO.  2007.   The state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture.  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Rome.  511 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., according to its [[National Pork Producers Council]], 80 million of its 95 million pigs slaughtered each year are reared in industrial settings.&lt;ref name=dominion/&gt;{{rp|29}}

===Chickens===
{{main|Poultry farming}}
[[Image:Florida chicken house.jpg|thumb|right|A commercial [[chicken]] house with open sides raising broiler pullets for meat]]
In the United States, chickens were raised primarily on family farms until 1965. Originally, the primary value in poultry was eggs, and meat was considered a byproduct of egg production.{{citation needed|date=November 2007}} Its supply was less than the demand, and poultry was expensive. Except in hot weather, eggs can be shipped and stored without refrigeration for some time before going bad; this was important in the days before widespread refrigeration.

Farm flocks tended to be small because the hens largely fed themselves through foraging, with some supplementation of grain, scraps, and waste products from other farm ventures. Such feedstuffs were in limited supply, especially in the winter, and this tended to regulate the size of the farm flocks. Soon after poultry keeping gained the attention of agricultural researchers (around 1896), improvements in nutrition and management made poultry keeping more profitable and businesslike.

Prior to about 1910, chicken was served primarily on special occasions or Sunday dinner. Poultry was shipped live or killed, plucked, and packed on ice (but not eviscerated). The "whole, ready-to-cook broiler" was not popular until the 1950s, when end-to-end refrigeration and sanitary practices gave consumers more confidence. Before this, poultry were often cleaned by the neighborhood butcher, though cleaning poultry at home was a commonplace kitchen skill.

Two kinds of poultry were generally used: broilers or "spring chickens"; young male chickens, a byproduct of the egg industry, which were sold when still young and tender (generally under 3 pounds live weight), and "stewing hens", also a byproduct of the egg industry, which were old hens past their prime for laying.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"The Dollar Hen", [[Milo Hastings]], (1909)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Battery hens -Bastos, Sao Paulo, Brazil-31March2007.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Hens in Brazil]]
The major milestone in 20th century poultry production was the discovery of vitamin D, which made it possible to keep chickens in confinement year-round. Before this, chickens did not thrive during the winter (due to lack of sunlight), and egg production, incubation, and meat production in the off-season were all very difficult, making poultry a seasonal and expensive proposition. Year-round production lowered costs, especially for broilers.

At the same time, egg production was increased by scientific breeding. After a few false starts, (such as the Maine Experiment Station's failure at improving egg production) success was shown by Professor Dryden at the Oregon Experiment Station.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, James. Poultry Breeding and Management. Orange Judd Press, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in production and quality were accompanied by lower labor requirements. In the 1930s through the early 1950s, 1,500 hens was considered to be a full-time job for a farm family. In the late 1950s, egg prices had fallen so dramatically that farmers typically tripled the number of hens they kept, putting three hens into what had been a single-bird cage or converting their floor-confinement houses from a single deck of roosts to triple-decker roosts. Not long after this, prices fell still further and large numbers of egg farmers left the business.

Robert Plamondon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plamondon.com|title=Plamondon.com: the home of Robert Plamondon and all his works!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that the last family chicken farm in his part of Oregon, Rex Farms, had 30,000 layers and survived into the 1990s. However the standard laying house of the current operators is around 125,000 hens.

This fall in profitability was accompanied by a general fall in prices to the consumer, allowing poultry and eggs to lose their status as luxury foods.

The [[vertical integration]] of the egg and poultry industries was a late development, occurring after all the major technological changes had been in place for years (including the development of modern broiler rearing techniques, the adoption of the Cornish Cross broiler, the use of laying cages, etc.).

By the late 1950s, poultry production had changed dramatically. Large farms and packing plants could grow birds by the tens of thousands. Chickens could be sent to [[slaughterhouse]]s for butchering and processing into prepackaged commercial products to be frozen or shipped fresh to markets or wholesalers. Meat-type chickens currently grow to market weight in six to seven weeks, whereas only fifty years ago it took three times as long.&lt;ref&gt;Havenstein, G.B., P.R. Ferket, and M.A. Qureshi, 2003a. Growth, livability, and feed conversion of 1957 versus 2001 broilers when fed representative 1957 and 2001 broiler diets. Poult. Sci. 82:1500–1508&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to genetic selection and nutritional modifications (but not the use of growth hormones, which are illegal for use in poultry in the US and many other countries). Once a meat consumed only occasionally, the common availability and lower cost has made chicken a common meat product within developed nations. Growing concerns over the [[cholesterol]] content of [[red meat]] in the 1980s and 1990s further resulted in increased consumption of chicken.

Today, eggs are produced on large egg ranches on which environmental parameters are well controlled. Chickens are exposed to artificial light cycles to stimulate egg production year-round. In addition, [[forced molting]] is commonly practiced, in which manipulation of light and food access triggers molting, with the goal of increased egg size and production. 
Forced molting is controversial.  While it is widespread in the US, it is prohibited in the EU.&lt;ref name="Wigley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2013/s/salmonella.pdf|publisher=Compassion in World Farming|title=Salmonella|author=Wigley, P.|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, a chicken lays one egg a day, but not on every day of the year. This varies with the breed and time of year. In 1900, average egg production was 83 eggs per hen per year. In 2000, it was well over 300. In the United States, laying hens are butchered after their second egg laying season. In Europe, they are generally butchered after a single season. The laying period begins when the hen is about 18–20 weeks old (depending on breed and season). Males of the egg-type breeds have little commercial value at any age, and all those not used for breeding (roughly fifty percent of all egg-type chickens) are killed soon after hatching. The old hens also have little commercial value. Thus, the main sources of poultry meat 100 years ago (spring chickens and stewing hens) have both been entirely supplanted by meat-type broiler chickens.

Some believe that the "deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu is essentially a problem of industrial poultry practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grain.org/briefings/?id=194|title=GRAIN — Fowl play: The poultry industry's central role in the bird flu crisis|publisher=|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4721598.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Science/Nature - Reality takes wing over bird flu|publisher=|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] article ''H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza'' by [[Robert G. Webster]] et al.:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by cocirculating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-1024.htm CDC] ''H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza'' by [[Robert G. Webster]] et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Webster explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you use a good vaccine you can prevent the transmission within poultry and to humans. But if they have been using vaccines now [in China] for several years, why is there so much bird flu? There is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out virus and maintaining it and changing it. And I think this is what is going on in China. It has to be. Either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used. Probably both. It's not just China. We can't blame China for substandard vaccines. I think there are substandard vaccines for influenza in poultry all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10639567/|title=Expert: Bad vaccines may trigger China bird flu|work=msnbc.com|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to the same concerns, Reuters reports Hong Kong infectious disease expert Lo Wing-lok saying that "The issue of vaccines has to take top priority", and Julie Hall, in charge of the WHO's outbreak response in China, saying that China's vaccinations might be "masking" the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HKG28205.htm |title=China H5N1 outbreak puts vaccines under spotlight |date=March 17, 2006 |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318225839/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HKG28205.htm |archive-date=March 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported that Wendy Barclay, a virologist at the [[University of Reading]], UK, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Chinese have made a vaccine based on reverse genetics made with H5N1 antigens, and they have been using it. There has been a lot of criticism of what they have done, because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected; and then you get drift – the virus mutates in response to the antibodies – and now we have a situation where we have five or six "flavours" of H5N1 out there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4737276.stm BBC] ''Bird flu vaccine no silver bullet'' February 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Keeping wild birds away from domestic birds is known to be key in the fight against H5N1. Caging (no [[free range]] poultry) is one way. Providing wild birds with restored wetlands so they naturally choose nonlivestock areas is another way that helps accomplish this. Political forces are increasingly demanding the selection of one, the other, or both based on nonscientific reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayonline.com/articles/112247.asp Today on line] article ''Restoring wetlands key to curbing bird flu: UN'' published April 13, 2006.{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this system of pig production grower pigs are housed indoors in group-housing or straw-lined sheds, whilst pregnant sows are confined in sow stalls ([[gestation crate]]s) and give birth in farrowing crates.

The use of sow stalls (gestation crates) has resulted in lower production costs, however, this practice has led to more significant [[animal welfare]] concerns.  Many of the world’s largest producers of pigs ([[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]]) use sow stalls, but some nations (e.g. the [[United Kingdom|UK]]) and some [[US States]] (e.g. [[Florida]] and [[Arizona]]) have banned them.

Intensive piggeries are generally large warehouse-like buildings.  Indoor pig systems allow the pig’s condition to be monitored, ensuring minimum fatalities and increased productivity. Buildings are ventilated and their temperature regulated.  Most domestic pig varieties are susceptible to heat stress, and all pigs lack sweat glands and cannot cool themselves. Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death.  Maintaining a more specific temperature within the pig-tolerance range also maximizes growth and growth to feed ratio.  In an intensive operation pigs will lack access to a wallow (mud), which is their natural cooling mechanism.  Intensive piggeries control temperature through ventilation or drip water systems (dropping water to cool the system).

Pigs are naturally omnivorous and are generally fed a combination of grains and protein sources (soybeans, or [[meat and bone meal]]).  Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed-grain crops are grown.  Alternatively, piggeries are reliant on the grains industry.  Pig feed may be bought packaged or mixed on-site.  The intensive piggery system, where pigs are confined in individual stalls, allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed.   The individual feeding system also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed. This has more significance to intensive farming methods, as the close proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly. To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth, drug programs such as [[antibiotic]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[hormone]]s and other supplements are preemptively administered.

Indoor systems, especially stalls and pens (i.e. ‘dry,’ not straw-lined systems) allow for the easy collection of waste. In an indoor intensive pig farm, manure can be managed through a lagoon system or other waste-management system. However, odor remains a problem which is difficult to manage.

The way animals are housed in intensive systems varies.  Breeding sows will spend the bulk of their time in sow stalls (also called gestation crates) during pregnancy or farrowing crates, with litter, until market.

Piglets often receive range of treatments including castration, tail docking to reduce tail biting, teeth clipped (to reduce injuring their mother's nipples and prevent later tusk growth) and their ears notched to assist identification.  Treatments are usually made without pain killers.  Weak [[runt]]s may be slain shortly after birth.

Piglets also may be [[wean]]ed and removed from the sows at between two and five weeks old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhogfarmer.com/mag/farming_revisiting_weaning_age|title=Revisiting Weaning Age Trends, Dynamics|date=October 15, 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed in sheds. However, grower pigs - which comprise the bulk of the herd - are usually housed in alternative indoor housing, such as batch pens.  During pregnancy, the use of a stall may be preferred as it facilitates feed-management and growth control. It also prevents pig aggression (e.g. tail biting, ear biting, vulva biting, food stealing).  Group pens generally require higher stockmanship skills.  Such pens will usually not contain straw or other material.  Alternatively, a straw-lined shed may house a larger group (i.e. not batched) in age groups.

Many countries have introduced laws to regulate treatment of farmed animals. In the USA, the federal [[Humane Slaughter Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusfd7usca1901.htm|title=US - Food Animal - Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter - Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires pigs to be stunned before slaughter, although compliance and enforcement is questioned.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

===Cattle===
{{main|Cattle}}
Cattle are [[domestication|domesticated]] [[ungulate]]s, a member of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Bovidae]], in the [[subfamily]] [[Bovinae]], and descended from the [[aurochs]] (''[[Bos primigenius]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Bollongino, Ruth &amp; al.

Accessed April 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They are raised as livestock for meat (called beef and [[veal]]), [[dairy product]]s (milk), leather and as [[draught animal]]s (pulling [[cart]]s, [[plow]]s and the like). In some countries, such as [[India]], they are honored in religious ceremonies and revered. As of 2009–2010 it is estimated that there are 1.3–1.4 billion head of cattle in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cattle-today.com/|title=Breeds of Cattle at CATTLE TODAY|publisher=|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/07/global-livestock-counts |title=Counting chickens |publisher=[[The Economist]] |accessdate=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle are often raised by allowing herds to [[graze]] on the grasses of large tracts of [[rangeland]] called [[ranching|ranches]]. Raising cattle in this manner allows the productive use of land that might be unsuitable for growing crops. The most common interactions with cattle involve daily [[Fodder|feeding]], cleaning and [[milking]]. Many routine husbandry practices involve [[ear tag]]ging, [[Horn (anatomy)|dehorning]], loading, [[Veterinary surgery|medical operations]], vaccinations and [[Cloven hoof|hoof]] care, as well as training for agricultural shows and preparations. There are also some cultural differences in working with cattle - the cattle husbandry of Fulani men rests on [[Ethology|behavioural techniques]], whereas in Europe cattle are controlled primarily by physical means like [[fence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lott | first = Dale F. |author2=Hart, Benjamin L. | title = Applied ethology in a nomadic cattle culture | journal = Applied Animal Ethology | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 309–319 | publisher = Elsevier B.V. | date=  October 1979 | doi = 10.1016/0304-3762(79)90102-0 }}&lt;!--| accessdate =November 7, 2006 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Once cattle obtain an entry-level weight, about {{convert|650|lb|kg}}, they are transferred from the range to a [[feedlot]] to be fed a specialized [[animal feed]] which consists of corn byproducts (derived from ethanol production), barley, and other grains as well as alfalfa and [[cottonseed meal]]. The feed also contains premixes composed of microingredients such as vitamins, minerals, chemical preservatives, [[Antibiotic use in livestock|antibiotics]], fermentation products, and other essential ingredients that are purchased from premix companies, usually in sacked form, for blending into commercial rations. Because of the availability of these products, a farmer using their own grain can formulate their own rations and be assured the animals are getting the recommended levels of minerals and vitamins.

Breeders can utilise cattle husbandry to reduce [[Mycobacterium bovis|M. bovis infection]] susceptibility by selective breeding and maintaining herd health to avoid concurrent disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Krebs JR, Anderson T, Clutton-Brock WT, etal |title=Bovine tuberculosis in cattle and badgers: an independent scientific review |publisher=Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food |year=1997 |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/publications/hpanel.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040722232232/http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/publications/hpanel.pdf |archivedate=July 22, 2004  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cattle are farmed for beef, veal, dairy, leather and they are sometimes used simply to maintain grassland for wildlife - for example, in [[Epping Forest]], England. They are often used in some of the most wild places for livestock. Depending on the breed, cattle can survive on hill grazing, heaths, marshes, moors and semi desert. Modern cows are more commercial than older breeds and having become more specialised are less versatile. For this reason many smaller farmers still favour old breeds, such as the dairy breed of cattle [[Jersey cattle|Jersey]].

There are many potential impacts on human health due to the modern cattle industrial agriculture system. There are concerns surrounding the antibiotics and growth hormones used, increased E. Coli contamination, higher saturated fat contents in the meat because of the feed, and also environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Pollan, Michael. 2002. This Steer's Life. ''The New York Times''. March 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, in the U.S. 766,350 producers participate in raising beef. The beef industry is segmented with the bulk of the producers participating in raising beef calves. Beef calves are generally raised in small herds, with over 90% of the herds having less than 100 head of cattle. Fewer producers participate in the finishing phase which often occurs in a [[feedlot]], but nonetheless there are 82,170 feedlots in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Agricultural Statistics Board, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 2010; [http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/USCatSup/USCatSup-12-17-2010.pdf Overview of the United States Cattle Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aquaculture==
{{main|Aquaculture}}

Aquaculture is the cultivation of the natural produce of water (fish, [[shellfish]], [[algae]] and other aquatic organisms). The term is distinguished from fishing by the idea of active human effort in maintaining or increasing the number of organisms involved, as opposed to simply taking them from the wild. Subsets of aquaculture include [[Mariculture]] (aquaculture in the ocean); [[Algaculture]] (the production of [[kelp]]/[[seaweed]] and other [[algae]]); [[Fish farming]] (the raising of [[catfish]], [[tilapia]] and [[milkfish]] in freshwater and brackish ponds or [[salmon]] in marine ponds); and the growing of [[pearl|cultured pearls]]. Extensive aquaculture is based on local photosynthetical production while intensive aquaculture is based on fish fed with an external food supply.

Aquaculture has been used since ancient times and can be found in many cultures. Aquaculture was used in China c. 2500 BC. When the waters lowered after river floods, some fishes, mainly [[Common carp|carp]], were held in artificial lakes. Their brood were later fed using [[nymph (biology)|nymph]]s and [[silkworm]] feces, while the fish themselves were eaten as a source of [[protein]]. The [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] people practiced aquaculture by constructing [[fish pond]]s (see [[Hawaiian aquaculture]]). A remarkable example from [[ancient Hawaii]] is the construction of a fish pond, dating from at least 1,000 years ago, at [[Menehune Fishpond|Alekoko]].&lt;ref&gt;Footnote: According to legend, it was constructed by the mythical [[Menehune]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese practiced cultivation of [[seaweed]] by providing [[bamboo]] poles and, later, nets and [[oyster]] shells to serve as anchoring surfaces for [[spores]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] often bred fish in ponds.

The practice of aquaculture gained prevalence in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], since fish were scarce and thus expensive. However, improvements in transportation during the 19th century made fish easily available and inexpensive, even in inland areas, causing a decline in the practice. The first North American fish hatchery was constructed on [[Dildo Island]], Newfoundland Canada in 1889, it was the largest and most advanced in the world.

Americans were rarely involved in aquaculture until the late 20th century, but California residents harvested wild kelp and made legal efforts to manage the supply starting c. 1900, later even producing it as a wartime resource.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neushul, Seaweed for War: California's World War I kelp industry, Technology and Culture 30 (July 1989), 561–583)&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to agriculture, the rise of aquaculture is a contemporary phenomenon. According to professor Carlos M. Duarte About 430 (97%) of the aquatic species presently in culture have been domesticated since the start of the 20th century, and an estimated 106 aquatic species have been domesticated over the past decade. The [[domestication]] of an aquatic species typically involves about a decade of scientific research. Current success in the domestication of aquatic species results from the 20th century rise of knowledge on the basic [[biology]] of aquatic species and the lessons learned from past success and failure. The stagnation in the world's [[fisheries]] and [[overexploitation]] of 20 to 30% of marine fish species have provided additional impetus to domesticate marine species, just as overexploitation of land animals provided the impetus for the early domestication of land species.

In the 1960s, the price of fish began to climb, as wild fish capture rates peaked and the human population continued to rise. Today, commercial aquaculture exists on an unprecedented, huge scale. In the 1980s, open-netcage [[Aquaculture of salmon|salmon farming]] also expanded; this particular type of aquaculture technology remains a minor part of the production of farmed finfish worldwide, but possible negative impacts on wild stocks, which have come into question since the late 1990s, have caused it to become a major cause of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Oceans/Aquaculture/Salmon/|title=Oceans|publisher=|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the total world production of fisheries product was 132.2 million tonnes of which aquaculture contributed 41.9 million tonnes or about 31% of the total world production. The growth rate of worldwide aquaculture is very rapid (greater than 10% per year for most species) while the contribution to the total from [[Wild fisheries of the world|wild fisheries]] has been essentially flat for the last decade.

In the US, approximately 90% of all shrimp consumed are farmed and imported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5600e/y5600e00.HTM|title=The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture|publisher=|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years salmon aquaculture has become a major export in southern [[Chile]], especially in [[Puerto Montt]] and [[Quellón]], Chile's fastest-growing city.

Farmed fish are kept in concentrations never seen in the wild, e.g. 50,000 fish in a {{convert|2|acre|m2|adj=on}} area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF9/984.html|title=Fuss over Farming Fish, Alaska Science    Forum|publisher=|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with each fish occupying less room than the average bathtub. This can cause several forms of pollution. Packed tightly, fish rub against each other and the sides of their cages, damaging their fins and tails and becoming sickened with various diseases and infections.&lt;ref&gt;This also causes stress.[http://www.advocatesforanimals.org.uk/resources/farmed/fish.html "Facts about Fish and Fish Farming", Advocates for Animals.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of sea lice have been noted to target farmed coho and farmed Atlantic salmon specifically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umaine.edu/livestock/Publications/sea_lice_bullets.htm University of Maine, Department of Animal, Veterinary and Aquaculture Sciences, "Sea Lice Information"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521115210/http://www.umaine.edu/livestock/Publications/sea_lice_bullets.htm |date=May 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such parasites may have an effect on nearby wild fish. For these reasons, aquaculture operators frequently need to use strong drugs to keep the fish alive (but many fish still die prematurely at rates of up to 30%&lt;ref&gt;[Lymbery, P. CIWF Trust report, "In Too Deep – The Welfare of Intensively Farmed Fish" (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;) and these drugs inevitably enter the environment.

The lice and pathogen problems of the 1990s facilitated the development of current treatment methods for sea lice and pathogens. These developments reduced the stress from parasite/pathogen problems. However, being in an ocean environment, the transfer of disease organisms from the wild fish to the aquaculture fish is an ever-present risk factor.&lt;ref&gt;[BULLETIN OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF FISH PATHOLOGISTS 22 (2): 117–125 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

The very large number of fish kept long-term in a single location produces a significant amount of condensed feces, often contaminated with drugs, which again affect local waterways. However, these effects appear to be local to the actual fish farm site and may be minimal to non-measurable in high current sites.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture===
{{main|Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture}}

Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is a practice in which the by-products (wastes) from one species are recycled to become inputs ([[fertilizer]]s, food) for another. Fed [[aquaculture]] (e.g. fish, [[shrimp]]) is combined with inorganic extractive (e.g. [[seaweed]]) and organic extractive (e.g. [[shellfish]]) aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability (biomitigation), economic stability (product diversification and risk reduction) and social acceptability (better management practices).&lt;ref name="Chopin et al. 2001"&gt;Chopin T, Buschmann AH, Halling C, Troell M, Kautsky N, Neori A, Kraemer GP, Zertuche-Gonzalez JA, Yarish C and Neefus C. 2001. Integrating seaweeds into marine aquaculture systems: a key toward sustainability. Journal of Phycology 37: 975–986.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Multi-trophic" refers to the incorporation of [[species]] from different [[trophic level|trophic]] or [[nutritional]] levels in the same system.&lt;ref name="Chopin 2006"&gt;Chopin T. 2006. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture. What it is, and why you should care... and don’t confuse it with polyculture. Northern Aquaculture, Vol. 12, No. 4, July/August 2006, pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one potential distinction from the age-old practice of aquatic [[polyculture]], which could simply be the co-culture of different fish species from the same trophic level. In this case, these organisms may all share the same biological and chemical processes, with few [[Synergy|synergistic]] benefits, which could potentially lead to significant shifts in the [[ecosystem]]. Some traditional polyculture systems may, in fact, incorporate a greater diversity of species, occupying several [[Ecological niche|niche]]s, as extensive cultures (low intensity, low management) within the same pond. The "Integrated" in IMTA refers to the more intensive cultivation of the different species in proximity of each other, connected by nutrient and energy transfer through water, but not necessarily right at the same location.

Ideally, the biological and chemical processes in an IMTA system should balance. This is achieved through the appropriate selection and proportions of different species providing different ecosystem functions. The co-cultured species should be more than just [[biofilters]]; they should also be harvestable crops of commercial value.&lt;ref name="Chopin 2006"/&gt; A working IMTA system should result in greater production for the overall system, based on mutual benefits to the co-cultured species and improved [[ecosystem health]], even if the individual production of some of the species is lower compared to what could be reached in [[monoculture]] practices over a short term period.&lt;ref name="Neori et al. 2004"&gt;Neori A, Chopin T, Troell M, Buschmann AH, Kraemer GP, Halling C, Shpigel M and Yarish C. 2004. Integrated aquaculture: rationale, evolution and state of the art emphasizing seaweed biofiltration in modern mariculture. Aquaculture 231: 361–391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the more general term "integrated aquaculture" is used to describe the integration of monocultures through water transfer between organisms.&lt;ref name="Neori et al. 2004"/&gt; For all intents and purposes however, the terms "IMTA" and "integrated aquaculture" differ primarily in their degree of descriptiveness. These terms are sometimes interchanged. [[Aquaponics]], fractionated aquaculture, IAAS (integrated agriculture-aquaculture systems), IPUAS (integrated peri-urban-aquaculture systems), and IFAS (integrated fisheries-aquaculture systems) may also be considered variations of the IMTA concept.

===Shrimp===
{{main|Shrimp farm}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
A [[shrimp farm]] is an [[aquaculture]] business for the cultivation of marine [[shrimp]] or [[prawn]]s for human consumption. Commercial shrimp farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply, particularly to match the market demands of the USA, Japan and Western Europe. The total global production of farmed shrimp reached more than 1.6 million [[tonne]]s in 2003, representing a value of nearly 9 Billion&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT replace this figure with "9 billion" due to the different meanings of "billion" (can be 10^9 or 10^12, depending on U.S/European usage). "9,000 million" is unambiguous. [[User:Lupo|Lupo]] 07:10, October 17, 2005 (UTC) --&gt; US$. About 75% of farmed shrimp is produced in Asia, in particular in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Thailand]]. The other 25% is produced mainly in Latin America, where [[Brazil]] is the largest producer. The largest exporting nation is Thailand.

Shrimp farming has moved from China to Southeast Asia into a meat packing industry. Technological advances have led to growing shrimp at ever higher densities, and [[broodstock]] is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are penaeids (i.e., of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Penaeidae]]), and just two species of shrimp—the ''[[Whiteleg shrimp|Penaeus vannamei]]'' (Pacific white shrimp) and the ''[[Penaeus monodon]]'' (giant tiger prawn)—account for roughly 80% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial [[monoculture]]s are very susceptible to diseases, which have caused several regional wipe-outs of farm shrimp populations. Increasing ecological problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both NGOs and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulation by governments.

==Regulation==
{{main|Animal law}}
In various jurisdictions, intensive animal production of some kinds is subject to regulation for environmental protection.  In the United States, a [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation]] (CAFO) that discharges or proposes to discharge waste requires a permit and implementation of a plan for management of manure nutrients, contaminants, wastewater, etc., as applicable, to meet requirements pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act.&lt;ref name=CAFOCDCP&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/cafos/about.htm "Concentrated animal feeding operations"], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 122.42(e)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some data on regulatory compliance and enforcement are available.  In 2000, the US Environmental Protection Agency published 5-year and 1-year data on environmental performance of 32 industries, with data for the livestock industry being derived mostly from inspections of CAFOs.  The data pertain to inspections and enforcement mostly under the Clean Water Act, but also under the Clean Air Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Of the 32 industries, livestock production was among the top seven for environmental performance over the 5-year period, and was one of the top two in the final year of that period, where good environmental performance is indicated by a low ratio of enforcement orders to inspections.   The five-year and final-year ratios of enforcement/inspections for the livestock industry were 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.  Also in the final year, the livestock industry was one of the two leaders among the 32 industries in terms of having the lowest  percentage of facilities with violations.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA. 2000. Profile of the agricultural livestock production industry. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Office of Compliance. EPA/310-R-00-002. 156 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Canada, intensive livestock operations are subject to provincial regulation, with definitions of regulated entities varying among provinces.  Examples include Intensive Livestock Operations (Saskatchewan), Confined Feeding Operations (Alberta), Feedlots (British Columbia), High-density Permanent Outdoor Confinement Areas (Ontario) and Feedlots or Parcs d'Engraissement (Manitoba).  In Canada, intensive animal production, like other agricultural sectors, is also subject to various other federal and provincial requirements.

In the United States, farmed animals are excluded by half of all state [[animal cruelty]] laws including the federal [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]]. The 28-hour law, enacted in 1873 and amended in 1994 states that when animals are being transported for slaughter, the vehicle must stop every 28 hours and the animals must be let out for exercise, food, and water. The United States Department of Agriculture claims that the law does not apply to birds. The Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter Act is similarly limited. Originally passed in 1958, the Act requires that livestock be stunned into unconsciousness prior to slaughter. This Act also excludes birds, who make up more than 90 percent of the animals slaughtered for food, as well as [[rabbit]]s and fish. Individual states all have their own animal cruelty statutes; however many states have a provision to exempt standard agricultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=1027] ALDF Farmed Animals and the Law&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States there is a growing movement to mitigate the worst abuses by regulating factory farming. In Ohio animal welfare organizations reached a negotiated settlement with farm organizations while in California, [[California Proposition 2 (2008)|Proposition 2, Standards for Confining Farm Animals]], an initiated law was approved by voters in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartvoter.org/2008/11/04/ca/state/prop/2/ Proposition 2, Standards for Confining Farm Animals]. Retrieved August 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations have been enacted in other states and plans are underway for referendum and lobbying campaigns in other states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/us/12farm.html "Farmers Lean to Truce on Animals’ Close Quarters"] article by Erik Eckholm in ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 11, 2010. Retrieved August 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

An action plan has been proposed by the USDA in February 2009, called the Utilization of Manure and Other Agricultural and Industrial Byproducts. This program’s goal is to protect the environment and human and animal health by using manure in a safe and effective manner. In order for this to happen, several actions need to be taken and these four components include:
•	Improving the Usability of Manure Nutrients through More Effective Animal Nutrition and Management
•	Maximizing the Value of Manure through Improved Collection, Storage, and Treatment Options
•	Utilizing Manure in Integrated Farming Systems to Improve Profitability and Protect Soil, Water, and Air Quality
•	Using Manure and Other Agricultural Byproducts as a Renewable Energy Source

In 2012 Australia's largest supermarket chain, Coles, announced that as of January 1, 2013, they will stop selling company branded pork and eggs from animals kept in factory farms. The nation's other dominant supermarket chain, Woolworths, has already begun phasing out factory farmed animal products. All of Woolworth's house brand eggs are now cage-free, and by mid-2013 all of their pork will come from farmers who operate stall-free farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ocean-robbins/animal-cruelty_b_2194615.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Ocean | last=Robbins | title=Is Animal Cruelty Doomed? | date=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are differences around the world as to which practices are accepted and there continue to be changes in regulations with animal welfare being a strong driver for increased regulation. For example, the EU is bringing in further regulation to set maximum stocking densities for meat chickens by 2010, {{update inline|date=July 2015|reason=It is past 2010}} where the UK Animal Welfare Minister commented, "The welfare of meat chickens is a major concern to people throughout the European Union. This agreement sends a strong message to the rest of the world that we care about animal welfare."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070508b.htm DEFRA press release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221050856/http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070508b.htm |date=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factory farming is greatly debated throughout Australia, with many people disagreeing with the methods and ways in which the animals in factory farms are treated. Animals are often under stress from being kept in confined spaces and will attack each other. In an effort to prevent injury leading to infection, their beaks, tails and teeth are removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poultryhub.org/health/health-management/beak-trimming/|title=Beak trimming|accessdate=August 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2075225/Pain-pigs-Undercover-filming-shows-animals-having-teeth-clipped-metal-pliers-anaesthetic.html|title=Pain of the pigs: Undercover filming shows animals having their teeth clipped off with metal pliers without anaesthetic|date=December 16, 2011|accessdate=August 5, 2012|work=Daily Mail|first=Sean|last=Poulter|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many piglets will die of shock after having their teeth and tails removed, because painkilling medicines are not used in these operations. Factory farms are a popular way to gain space, with animals such as chickens being kept in spaces smaller than an A4 page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/669754727|title=Eating Animals|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Hachette Book Group USA|others=Foer, Jonathan Safran|year=|isbn=9780316127165|location=|pages=47|oclc=669754727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the UK, de-beaking of chickens is [[deprecated]], but it is recognized that it is a method of last resort, seen as better than allowing vicious fighting and ultimately cannibalism.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Between 60 and 70 percent&lt;ref&gt;Barnett JL, Hemsworth PH, Cronin GM, Jongman EC, and Hutson GD. 2001.

===Human health impact===
According to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), farms on which animals are intensively reared can cause adverse health reactions in farm workers. Workers may develop acute and chronic lung disease, musculoskeletal injuries, and may catch [[zoonosis|infections that transmit from animals to human beings]] (such as tuberculosis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/conference/2006_conference/abstracts/session_D1.html | title=Factory Farming: The Impact of Animal Feeding Operations on the Environment and Health of Local Communities | accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC writes that chemical, bacterial, and viral compounds from animal waste may travel in the soil and water. Residents near such farms report problems such as unpleasant smell, flies and adverse health effects.&lt;ref name="CAFOCDCP"/&gt;

The CDC has identified a number of pollutants associated with the discharge of animal waste into rivers and lakes, and into the air. [[Antibiotic use in livestock]] may create antibiotic-resistant pathogens; parasites, bacteria, and viruses may be spread; [[ammonia]], [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]] can reduce oxygen in surface waters and contaminate drinking water; pesticides and hormones may cause hormone-related changes in fish; animal feed and feathers may stunt the growth of desirable plants in surface waters and provide nutrients to disease-causing micro-organisms; trace elements such as [[arsenic]] and [[copper]], which are harmful to human health, may contaminate surface waters.&lt;ref name="CAFOCDCP"/&gt;

Intensive farming may make the evolution and spread of harmful diseases easier. Many communicable animal diseases spread rapidly through densely spaced populations of animals and crowding makes genetic reassortment more likely. However, small family farms are more likely to introduce bird diseases and more frequent association with people into the mix, as happened in the [[2009 flu pandemic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/24/AR2009102402280.html?hpid=topnews | work=The Washington Post | first=David | last=Brown | title=Back where virus started, new scrutiny of pig farming | date=October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], growth hormones are banned on the basis that there is no way of determining a safe level. The UK has stated that in the event of the EU raising the ban at some future date, to comply with a precautionary approach, it would only consider the introduction of specific hormones, proven on a case by case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2006/jul/vpcreport|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] Food Standards Agency - VPC report on growth hormones in meat|author=Food Standards Agency|publisher=|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the [[European Union]] banned feeding animals antibiotics that were found to be valuable for human health.

In the United States, the use of antibiotics in livestock is still prevalent. The FDA reports that 80 percent of all antibiotics sold in 2009 were administered to livestock animals, and that many of these antibiotics are identical or closely related to drugs used for treating illnesses in humans. Consequently, many of these drugs are losing their effectiveness on humans, and the total healthcare costs associated with drug-resistant bacterial infections in the United States are between $16.6 billion and $26 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr965/text|title=H.R. 965: Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2011|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=August 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] (MRSA) has been identified in pigs and humans raising concerns about the role of pigs as reservoirs of MRSA for human infection.

CC398 is a new clone of MRSA that has emerged in animals and is found in intensively reared production animals (primarily pigs, but also cattle and poultry), where it can be transmitted to humans.

A 2011 nationwide study reported nearly half of the meat and poultry sold in U.S. grocery stores — 47 percent — was contaminated with S. aureus, and more than half of those bacteria — 52 percent — were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tgen.org/news/index.cfm?newsid=1948|title=Nationwide study finds U.S. meat and poultry is widely contaminated|date=April 15, 2011|accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Staph should be killed with proper cooking, it may still pose a risk to consumers through improper food handling and cross-contamination in the kitchen.

This sometimes results in the [[pollution]] of water, soil and air by [[agrochemical]]s and manure waste, and use of limited resources such as water and energy at unsustainable rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/549|title=Is Meat Sustainable?|date=|website=Worldwatch Institute: Vision for a Sustainable World|publisher=World Watch Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entomophagy]] is evaluated by many experts{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} as a sustainable solution to traditional [[livestock]], and, if intensively farmed on a large-scale, would cause a far-lesser amount of environmental damage.

Industrial production of pigs and poultry is an important source of [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions and is predicted to become more so. On intensive pig farms, the animals are generally kept on concrete with slats or grates for the manure to drain through. The manure is usually stored in slurry form (slurry is a liquid mixture of urine and feces). During storage on farm, slurry emits [[methane]] and when manure is spread on fields it emits [[nitrous oxide]] and causes [[nitrogen pollution]] of land and water.

===Labor===
Small farmers are often absorbed into factory farm operations, acting as contract growers for the industrial facilities. In the case of poultry contract growers, farmers are required to make costly investments in construction of sheds to house the birds, buy required feed and drugs - often settling for slim profit margins, or even losses.

Research has shown that many immigrant workers in concentrated animal farming operations (CAFOs) in the United States receive little to no job-specific training or safety and health information regarding the hazards associated with these jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramos|first=Athena K.|last2=Fuentes|first2=Axel|last3=Trinidad|first3=Natalia|date=November 9, 2016|title=Perception of Job-Related Risk, Training, and Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) among Latino Immigrant Hog CAFO Workers in Missouri: A Pilot Study|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2313-576X/2/4/25|journal=Safety|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=25|doi=10.3390/safety2040025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers with limited English proficiency are significantly less likely to receive any work-related training, since it is often only provided in English. As a result, many workers do not perceive their jobs as dangerous. This causes inconsistent personal protective equipment (PPE) use, and can lead to workplace accidents and injuries. Immigrant workers are also less likely to report any workplace hazards and injuries.

===Market concentration===
The major concentration of the industry occurs at the slaughter and meat processing phase, with only four companies slaughtering and processing 81 percent of cows, 73 percent of sheep, 57 percent of pigs and 50 percent of chickens.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}   This concentration at the slaughter phase may be in large part due to regulatory barriers that may make it financially difficult for small slaughter plants to be built, maintained or remain in business. Factory farming may be no more beneficial to livestock producers than traditional farming because it appears to contribute to [[overproduction]] that drives down prices. Through "forward contracts" and "marketing agreements", meatpackers are able to set the price of livestock long before they are ready for production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/this-cattlemans-got-a-beef/Content?oid=1121453|title=This Cattleman's Got a Beef|work=Colorado Springs Independent|date=November 20, 2003|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies often cause farmers to lose money, as half of all U.S. family farming operations did in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodandwater.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/FactoryFarmNation-web.pdf|title=''Factory Farm Nation: How America Turned its Livestock Farms into Factories''|date=November 2010|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, there were one million pig farms in America; as of 2002, there were 114,000.&lt;ref name=dominion/&gt;{{rp|29}}

Many of the nation's livestock producers would like to market livestock directly to consumers but with limited USDA inspected slaughter facilities, livestock grown locally can not typically be slaughtered and processed locally.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony by Leland Swenson, president of the U.S. National Farmers' Union, before the House Judiciary Committee, September 12, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demonstrations===
From 2011 to 2014 each year between 15,000 and 30,000 people gathered under the theme ''[[We are fed up]]!'' in Berlin to protest against industrial livestock production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/berlin-protests-focus-on-farming-and-food-safety-1.1316948|title=Berlin protests focus on farming and food safety|date=January 21, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/protesters-in-berlin-call-for-an-end-to-factory-farming/a-14780207-1 Deutsche Welle, ''Protesters in Berlin call for an end to factory farming'', 22 January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/farmers-defend-themselves-at-berlins-green-week/a-17369859|title=Farmers defend themselves at Berlin′s Green Week - Business - DW.COM - 17.01.2014|work=DW.COM|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fast Food===
The meat that is used in fast food industries often comes from factory farms because of the low prices. The animals that the meat comes from are treated with drugs and antibiotics for the purpose of accelerating weight gain, and preventing disease in crowded and unsanitary farming conditions. However, these animals suffer greatly because their internal organs and bones can not keep up with the rapid increase in weight. Chickens that go through this process can hardly take a few steps because of their underdeveloped bones. The antibiotics used on the animals can have a negative effect on the consumers as well. When a certain antibiotic is issued to a group of animals for a long period of time, the bacteria residing in the animals will develop a resistance to the drug. If a person consumes improperly cooked meat with drug resistant bacteria and becomes sick, that person would become unresponsive to any antibiotic treatment. There have been regulations implemented on fast food companies to restrict the usage of antibiotics. Surveys and tests are conducted on industries to determine their antibiotic usage rate, and each industry is issued a grade ranging from an A to a F. As of 2018, only two fast food chains earned an A and 11 earned a F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/27/health/fast-food-antibiotics-grades/index.html|title=Restaurant report card: What's in your meat?|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''J'ouvert''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|u|v|eɪ}}) is a large [[street party]] held annually as part of [[Carnival]] in many [[Caribbean]] islands (primarily in the [[Lesser Antilles]]) and in areas where Caribbean peoples have immigrated. 

''J'ouvert'' is likely a gallicization of ''jou ouvè'', the [[Antillean Creole|Antillean Creole French]] term meaning "dawn" or "daybreak" as this is the time at which the festival is typically held. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Allsopp |encyclopedia=Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage |isbn=0-198-66152-5 |first=R. |publisher=Oxford University Press |title= |volume=1 |location=Kingston |pages=776 |date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
J'ouvert is celebrated in many countries throughout the Caribbean. J'ouvert is also celebrated in many places outside the Caribbean as part of Carnival celebrations throughout the year, with the biggest celebrations happening in places around the world with large Caribbean [[ex-pat]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/bloodshed-nyc-promises-safer-jouvert-festival-41856773 "After Bloodshed, NYC Promises a Safer J'ouvert Festival"] ABC News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37024463 "In pictures: Fifty years of the Notting Hill Carnival"] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Caribana]] Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the celebration involves [[Calypso music|calypso]]/[[Soca music|soca]] bands and their followers dancing through the streets. The [[festival]] starts well before dawn and peaks a few hours after sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/up-close-at-trinidads-carnival-45542504/?no-ist "Up Close at Trinidad's Carnival"] Smithsonian.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnival was introduced to Trinidad by French settlers in 1783, a time of [[slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/Carnival/tabid/105/Default.aspx "'Mama Dis is Mas': A Historical Overview of the Trinidad Carnival, 1783 – 1900"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215115554/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/Carnival/tabid/105/Default.aspx |date=15 December 2014 }} National Library and Information System Authority&lt;/ref&gt; Banned from the [[masquerade balls]] of the French, the enslaved people would stage their own mini-carnivals in their backyards — using their own [[rituals]] and [[folklore]], but also imitating and sometimes mocking their masters’ behavior at the [[masquerade balls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allahwe.org/History.html "History of Carnival"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831061843/http://www.allahwe.org/History.html |date=2009-08-31 }} All Ah We&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of street parties associated with J'ouvert coincide with the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]] from [[slavery]] in 1838. Emancipation provided Africans with the opportunity not only to participate in Carnival, but to embrace it as an expression of their newfound freedom. Some theorize that some J'ouvert traditions are carried forward in remembrance of civil disturbances in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]], when the people smeared themselves with oil or paint to avoid being recognized.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The [[traditions]] of J'ouvert vary widely throughout the Caribbean. In [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Grenada]], a part of the tradition involves smearing paint, mud or oil on the bodies of participants known as "[[Jab Jabs]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncctt.org/new/index.php/about-ncc/departments/regional/trad-carnival-characters/312-traditional-mas-characters-jab-molassie.html "Traditional Mas Characters - Jab Molassie"], National Carnival Commission of Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/Carnival/tabid/105/Default.aspx?PageContentID=81 "Carnival - Traditional Carnival Characters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215172237/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/Carnival/tabid/105/Default.aspx?PageContentID=81 |date=15 December 2014 }} National Library and Information System Authority (Trinidad &amp; Tobago)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/up-close-at-trinidads-carnival-45542504/?no-ist "Up Close at Trinidad's Carnival"] Smithsonian.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://groundationgrenada.com/2011/08/18/a-carnival-theme-rooted-in-our-traditions-by-dr-nicole-phillip/ "A Carnival Theme Rooted in our Traditions by Dr. Nicole Phillip"] GroundationGrenada.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, J'ouvert is celebrated on the first day of August (Emanicipation Day), and yet for other West Indian countries J'ouvert is observed the night before the daytime "Pretty Mas" parade. Pretty Mas, a bright and festive version of the celebration, features colorful feathers and beaded costumes and is more popular and commercially publicized. J'ouvert values the transgressive dirt, while Pretty Mas celebrates the transcendent glitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jedsonline.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Sheriff-.pdf | title = J'ouvert Speaks to the Present. | last = Sheriff | first =Nai-Whedai | date = 2014 | publisher = World Dance Alliance |work= Journal of Emerging Dance Scholarship | access-date = 30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; J'ouvert can further be contrasted with Pretty Mas such that J'ouvert is said to be for "the people" while Pretty Mas is intended for the establishment.

[[Barbados]] does not celebrate J'ouvert, but instead celebrates Foreday Morning, which is often likened to J'ouvert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donaldson|first1=Tara|title=How to Do Barbados Crop Over Like a Local|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tara-donaldson/how-to-do-barbados-crop-o_b_5663880.html|accessdate=7 September 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Six-Day War}}
The '''Jordanian campaign''' of 1967 was part of the broader [[Six-Day War]], in which [[Israel]] inflicted a devastating defeat on [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Iraq]]. For Israel, it was the most significant part of the war, as it resulted in the capture of many Jewish monuments by the Israelis.

==Background==
On 5 June 1967, Israel launched [[Operation Focus]], in which the [[Israeli Air Force]] almost annihilated the air force of Egypt. After defeating Egypt in desert combat, which took place in Egypt's [[Sinai Peninsula]], Israel then turned its attention to Jordan, which had launched an attack on Israel in aid of Egypt.

==Battle==
[[King Hussein]] of Jordan had not only Jordanian troops but also a force of Iraqi commandos to assist him in the defense. Israel's objective was to capture [[East Jerusalem]], then under Jordanian administration. The main battle was in [[Jerusalem]]. Fighting also raged in other areas of the West Bank, where Iraqi commandos and Jordanian soldiers defended their positions. The Jordanians fought from their bunkers and strongpoints, and had to be dislodged by the Israelis. The [[Battle of Ammunition Hill]] was one of the fiercest battles of the  war, in which a force of Israeli troops faced Jordanian soldiers on a hill in East Jerusalem; 71 Jordanians and 37 Israelis were killed.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/122473 |title=Jerusalem Day: Remembering the Critical Ammunition Hill Battle |work=[[Arutz Sheva|Israel National News]]|last=Fendel |first=Hillel |date=16 May 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli troops also seized [[Bethlehem]]. Israeli troops moved behind tanks and left holy sites untouched. Forty Jordanian defenders were killed, and the remainder retreated. The Israelis pushed into Jerusalem. They engaged in [[urban warfare]] in [[Jerusalem]], aiming to reach the [[Old City of Jerusalem]]. [[Mandelbaum Gate]] was the first major objective. The Israelis ran into a camouflaged firing post, which brought down every soldier who tried to break through. A tank finally neutralized the enemy position. After the gate was breached, the next objectives were the [[Damascus Gate]] and the [[Rockefeller Museum]]. These were captured. In hand-to-hand fighting, Israeli troops broke into the old city. The Israeli high command issued the order to use no armor in the old city. This resulted in heavier casualties, but the Israelis were concerned that many Jewish relics and monuments would be destroyed. The Israelis eventually took the Old City and could once again pray at the [[Western Wall]], the first time in 19 years.

==Aftermath==
{{main|Reunification of Jerusalem}}
Seven hundred Jordanian and ten Iraqis were killed and 2,500 Jordanians and 30 Iraqis were wounded, whilst 550 Israelis had been killed, and 2,400 wounded.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The Israelis moved on to the mountainous [[Golan Heights]], then under [[Syria]]n control. After mountain fighting with Syrian troops, the Israelis occupied the Golan Heights.

The '''Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia''' ({{lang-it|Regno Lombardo-Veneto}}, {{lang-de|Königreich Lombardo–Venetien}}; {{lang-la|Regnum Langobardiae et Venetiae}}), commonly called the '''Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom''', was a constituent land ([[crown land]]) of the [[Austrian Empire]]. It was created in 1815 by resolution of the [[Congress of Vienna]] in recognition of the Austrian [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]]'s rights to [[Lombardy]] and the former [[Republic of Venice]] after the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]], proclaimed in 1805, had collapsed.&lt;ref name=RRS&gt;{{cite book|title=Diglossia and Power |first=Rosita |last=Rindler Schjerve |year=2003 |place=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally dissolved in 1866 when its remaining territory was incorporated into the recently proclaimed [[Kingdom of Italy]].

==History==
[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (56).JPG|thumb|left|235px|An Austrian [[herald]]'s [[tabard]] ''(Wappenrock)'' with the [[coat of arms]] of Lombardy-Venetia (1834) – Weltliche Schatzkammer in [[Vienna]]]]
In 1814, [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] the Austrians had confirmed their claims to the territories of the former Lombard [[Duchy of Milan]], which had been ruled by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] since 1718 and together with the adjacent [[Duchy of Mantua]] by the [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] tree branch of the dynasty from 1713 to 1796, and of the former [[Republic of Venice]], which had been under Austrian rule intermittently upon the 1797 [[Treaty of Campo Formio]].

The Congress of Vienna combined these lands into a single kingdom, ruled in [[personal union]] by the Habsburg [[Emperor of Austria]]; as distinct of the neighbouring [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio]] as well as the [[Duchy of Parma]], which remained independent entities under Habsburg rule. The Austrian emperor was represented day-to-day by [[viceroy]]s appointed by the Imperial Court in [[Vienna]] and resident in [[Milan]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=RSF&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of the World: Volume 2 |first=Richard S. |last=Fisher |year=1852 |place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FYS&gt;{{cite book|title=Garibaldi: His Life and Times |last=Francis Young &amp; W.B.B. Stevens |year=1864 |place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AWA&gt;{{cite book|title=The United Service magazine: Vol.75 |first=Arthur William Alsager |last=Pollock |year=1854 |place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ERF&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbuch für Reisende in Italien: Vol.1 |first=Ernst |last=Förster |year=1866 |place=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia was first ruled by Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] from 1815 to his death in 1835. His son [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] ruled from 1835 to 1848. In Milan on 6 September 1838 he became the last king to be crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]. The crown was subsequently brought to Vienna after the loss of Lombardy in 1859, but was restored to Italy after the loss of Venetia in 1866.

Though the local administration was Italian in language and staff, the Austrian authorities had to cope with the [[Italian unification]] (''Risorgimento'') movement. After a popular revolution on 22 March 1848, known as the "[[Five Days of Milan]]", the Austrians fled from [[Milan]], which became the capital city of a ''Governo Provvisorio della Lombardia'' (Lombardy Provisional Government). The next day, [[Venice]] also rose against the Austrian rule, forming the ''[[Republic of San Marco|Governo Provvisorio di Venezia]]'' (Venice Provisional Government). The Austrian forces under Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Joseph Radetzky]], after defeating the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian]] troops at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] (24–25 July 1848), entered Milan (6 August) and Venice (24 August 1849), and once again restored Austrian rule.

Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] ruled over the Kingdom for the rest of its existence. The office of Viceroy was abolished and replaced by a [[Governor-General]]. The office was initially assumed by Field Marshal Radetzky, upon his retirement in 1857 it passed it to Franz Joseph's younger brother [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] (who later became [[Emperor of Mexico]]), who served as Governor-General in Milan from 1857 to 1859.

===End of the Kingdom===
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] and the defeat in the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859, Austria by the [[Treaty of Zurich]] had to cede Lombardy up to the [[Mincio]] River, except for the fortresses of [[Mantua]] and [[Peschiera del Garda|Peschiera]], to the French Emperor [[Napoleon III]], who immediately passed it to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and the embryonic [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] state. Maximilian retired to [[Miramare Castle]] near [[Trieste]], while the capital was relocated to [[Venice]]. However, remaining Venetia and Mantua likewise fell to the Kingdom of Italy in the aftermath of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], by the 1866 [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]].&lt;ref name=Schjerve /&gt; The territory of Venetia and Mantua was formally transferred from Austria to France, and then handed over to Italy on 19 October 1866, for diplomatic reasons; a [[plebiscite]] marked the Italian annexation on 21–22 October 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raixevenete.com/21-22-ottobre-1866-annessione-del-veneto-allitalia-2/ "21st-22nd October 1866: annexation of Veneto to Italy" (in [[Italian language|Italian]])]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
Administratively the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia comprised two independent governments (''Gubernien'') in its two parts, which officially were declared separate crown lands in 1851. Each part was further subdivided in several provinces, roughly corresponding with the ''[[Departments of France|départements]]'' of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy.

Lombardy included the provinces of Milan, Como, Bergamo, Brescia, Pavia, Cremona, Mantova, Lodi-Crema, and Sondrio. Venetia included the provinces of Venice, Verona, Padova, Vicenza, Treviso, Rovigo, Belluno, and Udine.&lt;ref name=Schjerve&gt;Rosita Rindler Schjerve (2003) "Diglossia and Power: Language Policies and Practice in the 19th Century Habsburg Empire", {{ISBN|3-11-017653-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=w6W9V70JgvAC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;vq=Lombardy-Venetia&amp;dq=%22utraquist+schools%22&amp;sig=RdPsUVamoozKVuLo5Er38FmKifw#PPA199,M1 pp. 199-200]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ethnographic map of Karl von Czoernig-Czernhausen, issued by the [[Imperial and Royal|k.u.k.]] Administration of Statistics in 1855, the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia had a population of 5,024,117 people, consisting of the following ethnic groups: 4,625,746 Italians; 351,805 [[Friuli]]ans; 12,084 Germans ([[Cimbrian language|Cimbrians]] in Venetia); 26,676 [[Slavia Friulana|Slovenians]] and 7,806 [[Jews]].

[[File:Cimetière de Bruxelles 10.jpg|thumb|Memorial to the victims of the ''Innovation'' Department Store Fire in [[Evere]], [[Belgium]]]]

The '''''L'Innovation'' fire''' was a fire which took place at the ''À L'Innovation'' [[department store]] on the [[Rue Neuve (Brussels)|Rue Neuve]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] on 22 May 1967. 251  people were killed, 62 injured and the department store itself, the work of the architect [[Victor Horta]], was destroyed. In the aftermath of the fire, there was speculation that it might have been started by anti-American, Maoist protestors in the context of the [[Cold War]] and [[opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War]].

The ''Innovation'' fire was a major [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] and remains the most deadly fire in Belgian history.

==The ''Innovation'' store==
The ''Innovation'' department store was situated on the fashionable [[Rue Neuve (Brussels)|Rue Neuve]] in [[Brussels]]. It was housed in a purpose-built edifice constructed by the leading [[Art Nouveau]] architect [[Victor Horta]] in 1901. The store had five floors and, in 1967, had daily [[revenue|takings]] of 30 million [[Belgian franc]]s (roughly 4,300,000 [[euro]]s of 2015).

==Fire==
[[File:Department store « A L’Innovation » (destroyed, Brussels).jpg|thumb|The ''Innovation'' store, pictured soon after its construction in 1901.]]
An exhibit featuring American merchandise that began on 5 May and included [[Jeans|blue jeans]], [[barbecue]] equipment and paper dolls had created outrage among a pro-[[China]] group called "Action for the Peace and Independence of Peoples."  In the days leading up to the fire, [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] outside the store had taken place, while [[pamphlet]]s promising greater conflict also circulated.  

The blaze began in the five-story structure at approximately 13:30 when more than 1,000 people were in the store. The store was built with an atrium in the center open to all floors and topped with a skylight, an architecture that behaved like a chimney giving a steady air draft to the store's wooden floors and walls.  Cries of "fire!" caused [[panic]], with virtually the entire store engulfed in just 10 minutes. No [[Fire sprinkler system|sprinkler system]] or other active fire fighting system was present. Many shoppers rushed to windows, since the main stairway was enveloped in thick  black [[smoke]], while some jumped to their deaths before fire ladders arrived.  Still others went to the roof and escaped via nearby buildings.  Some employees, having become used to the exploding [[fireworks]] that protestors had set off, ignored pleas to leave the building until it was too late.

The origin of the fire was a source of confusion, with store management first stating that the inferno began in the first-floor children's wear department.  That was a contradiction of witnesses who had seen exploding butane canisters in the third floor camping department, as well as fourth floor problems{{what?|date=June 2013}} in the kitchen of the store's restaurant. Further controversy came about when one witness claimed to have heard one person shout after the fire began, "I'm giving my life for [[Vietnam]]!"

On May 30, a funeral service for the victims, attended by Belgium's [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin I]] and [[Queen Fabiola]], was held at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Belgium|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]].  Other towns also held funeral masses. The fire marked the worst single-building fire worldwide since the 1961 [[Niteroi circus fire]] in [[Brazil]], and was Belgium's greatest disaster since the August 1956 coal mine tragedy at the [[Bois du Cazier]] colliery in [[Marcinelle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5336">The '''''Ludi Apollinares''''' were solemn games (''[[ludi]]'') held annually by the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] in honor of the god [[Apollo]]. The tradition goes that at the first celebration hereof, they were suddenly invaded by the enemy, and obliged to take to their arms. A cloud of darts and arrows fell upon their enemies, and the Romans soon returned victorious to their sports.

== First Ludi ==

The games were established after inspecting a collection of prophecies, the Carmina Marciana.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;“Ludi” Brill’s New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the ancient world. 2005 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; One of several seers (vates) responsible for these predictions was Marcius.&lt;ref&gt;“Marcius” Brill’s New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the ancient world. 2005 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The games were organized in accordance with the Oracles of Marcius, which had predicted the disaster at [[Cannae]] (the defeat of the Romans by Hannibal) &lt;ref&gt;Livy – Periochae, book 25, line 3. Obtained online at http://www.livius.org/li-ln/livy/periochae/periochae023.html#25&lt;/ref&gt;

The prophecies dictated that the Romans should use Greek ritual to honor Diana and Latona, and that they should help contribute to the costs of the games, according to their means. The [[Sibylline Books]] were also consulted and confirmed this prophecy.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; This occurred at the height of the [[Second Punic War]], when [[Hannibal]] was invading northern Italy.  As in other times, the games were used to allay the public’s fears and distract them from Hannibal’s invasion.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Cook, 2002. The Calpurnii and Roman Family History: An Analysis of the Piso Frugi Coin in the Joel Handshu Collection at the College of Charleston. Chrestomathy: Annual Review of Undergraduate Research at the College of Charleston. Volume 1, 2002: pp. 1-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The games were held in the [[Circus Maximus]], with equestrian games as well as stage performances, including ''[[praetexta]]e'', a category of Roman drama.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, 1995. Fabulae Praetextae in Context: When Were Plays on Contemporary Subjects Performed in Republican Rome? The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 45, No. 1. (1995), pp. 170-190.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ennius]] (239-169 BC) had [[Thyestes]] performed as part of this festival in 169 BC.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, 1940. Marcus Junius Brutus and the "Brutus" of Accius. The Classical Journal, Vol. 35, No. 8. (May, 1940), pp. 460-470.&lt;/ref&gt; The ludi Apollinares received less funding from the Roman government than other games/festivals such as the [[ludi Romani]] or ludi plebeii, because it was shorter and had only one day of races.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 1930. Appropriations for the Games at Rome in 51 A. D. The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 51, No. 3. (1930), pp. 249-250.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timing ==

The Ludi Apollinares were games which were first organized in 212 BC, when [[Publius Cornelius Sulla (flamen dialis)|C. Sulla]] was [[praetor]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;“Cornelii Sullae” Brill’s New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the ancient world. 2005 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially a vow was made to hold them only once.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; There is some discussion as to who officially made them annual games.

One version of events proposes that [[L. Varus]], the praetor urbanus at the time, renewed this vow and celebrated them again in 210 BC.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; They were made an annual festival by a law in 208 BC by L. Varus, who was then ''[[curule aedile]]''.&lt;ref&gt;“Licinius” Brill’s New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the ancient world. 2005 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; A severe plague in 208 BC may have prompted the Senate to make them permanent, in honor of Apollo, who they regarded as a god of healing.&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; From this day on, they were celebrated on July 13 and eventually grew to last 8 or 9 days.,&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="multiref1"/&gt;

However, [[Livy]] suggests that it was [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso (praetor 211 BC)|C. Calpurnius Piso]], not L. Varus, who made the games permanent as praetor in 211 BC. “The Games of Apollo had been exhibited the previous year, and when the question of their repetition the next year was moved by the praetor Calpurnius, the senate passed a decree that they should be observed for all time.” &lt;ref&gt;Livy 26.23.3 Translated by Rev.

Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., London, 1905 Obtained online at http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy26.html&lt;/ref&gt; He continues, “…Such is the origin of the Apollinarian Games, which were instituted for the cause of victory and not, as is generally thought, in the interests of the public health.” &lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Livy (25.12) Translated by Rev.

The '''Milperra Massacre''', '''Milperra bikie shoot-out'''{{sfn|NSW Parliament|1995|p=4488}} or '''Father's Day Massacre'''&lt;ref name=TheAge20050126&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/TV--Radio/The-day-death-rode-in/2005/01/26/1106415606296.html  |title=The day death rode in  |author=Paul Kalina |publisher=[[The Age]] |date=27 January 2005 |accessdate=6 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a firearm battle between rival motorcycle gang members on 2 September ([[Father's Day]] in Australia&lt;ref name=TheAge20050126 /&gt;) 1984, in [[Milperra, New South Wales|Milperra]], a south-western suburb of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]. The shootout had its roots in an intense rivalry that developed after a group of [[Comanchero Motorcycle Club|Comancheros]] broke away and formed the first [[Bandidos]] Motorcycle Club chapter in Australia. Seven people were killed and twenty-eight injured when the two groups clashed at Milperra.  The event was a catalyst for significant changes to gun laws in New South Wales.

==Prelude==
Police believe that the war began over turf or drugs or a combination of both. However, both clubs at that time had a strong no drugs policy and Colin "Caesar" Campbell, [[Sergeant-at-Arms]] of both Comanchero Chapters and Sergeant-at-Arms of the Bandidos after they were patched over, points to the acrimony of the split as the sole reason. According to Campbell, in late 1983, one of his brothers and another Comanchero had called on another member and caught the Comancheros' president (and founder) William George "Jock" Ross, in a compromising position with the member's wife. As Sergeant-at-Arms, he ordered Ross to face charges of breaking one of the 10 firm rules the club observed.{{efn|Comanchero Club Rule 4: "Any member found guilty of screwing another member’s Ol’ Lady, or taking advantage of a rift between them for future conning up, will be thrown out"{{sfn|Kent|2009}}}} If found guilty, Ross would have been expelled from the club. Ross failed to appear at the first two scheduled meetings and, after arriving at the third, simply announced that the club would be split into two chapters and walked out. Those who supported bringing charges against Ross, the six Campbell brothers, the three McElwaine brothers, Anthony "Snodgrass" Spencer (Snoddy) and Charles "Charlie" Sciberras remained at the [[Birchgrove, New South Wales|Birchgrove]] clubhouse that overlooked [[Yurulbin Park]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=150+Louisa+Road,+Birchgrove,+New+South+Wales&amp;ll=-33.846574,151.18578&amp;spn=0.009962,0.013711&amp;sll=-33.848108,151.18192&amp;sspn=0.009962,0.013711 Google Maps location of Bandido clubhouse]&lt;/ref&gt; while Ross and the remaining Comancheros set up a new clubhouse in [[Harris Park, New South Wales|Harris Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?q=65+Harris+St,+Harris+Park&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=-25.335448,135.745076&amp;sspn=43.569223,56.162109 Google Maps location of Comanchero clubhouse]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the club's 1983 [[Run (motorcycle)|Christmas run]] fighting broke out between the two Chapters, prompting the Birchgrove chapter to  break away and form a new club. Spencer had visited several outlaw clubs in America two years earlier and remembered how much respect U.S Bandidos showed to him, so he contacted their National President [[Ronnie Hodge]]. After much correspondence, he received approval to form the first Australian Bandidos chapter and become its national president. The new Bandidos members then incinerated their Comanchero colours in a ceremonial act. Clubhouse attacks and other violence continued until August when Campbell alleged that Spencer and Ross "declared war" in a phone call.{{sfn|Kent|2009}}

==Battle==
An advertisement for a British motorcycle club [[Flea market|swap meet]] was placed in a few local press releases, to be held at the Viking Tavern, with a scheduled start at 10 am on Sunday, 2 September 1984. On that day at around 1&amp;nbsp;pm, 19  armed Comancheros entered the car park of the Viking Tavern during the swap meet and took up positions in hiding. Using [[walkie-talkie]]s for communication, Comanchero leader "Jock" Ross, a military enthusiast, intended to stand in the open to give the appearance he was alone, hoping to draw the Bandidos into a [[pincer movement]] that was based on the [[Impi#Tactics|"Bullhorn Ambush"]] that he read had been used in the [[Second Boer War]]. However, he was distracted by the presence of members of a rival club the [[Mobshitters]] and went to the back of the tavern to ensure they were not going to get involved.

The Bandidos were late and thinking that they were not coming, some of the Comancheros went into the Viking Tavern bar. Approximately 20&amp;nbsp;minutes later, 34 equally armed Bandidos members arrived. Caught off guard, the Comancheros were scattered around the car park when the Bandidos arrived. The Bandidos pulled up in a group at the western end of the car park and after distributing guns and other weapons, moved to confront the Comancheros president. The initial confrontation between the clubs was verbal, involving the brandishing of "non-lethal" weapons and challenges to drop the guns and settle it like men, but ended with the accidental discharge of a shotgun into the air. The involuntary discharge was the catalyst for [[pitched battle]] involving fists, guns and other weapons. Contrary to some newspaper reports, there was no charge toward one another, nor were formal battle lines drawn. Although never mentioned by the media or charged, several wives and girlfriends of the club members took part. Once the first shot was fired, it evolved into a series of bashings and kickings with sporadic gunfire. Bandido member Gregory "Shadow" Campbell  was shot in the throat by a shotgun and died instantly. Because of the number of charges this man’s own brother was charged with the murder. Bandidos vice president Mario "Chopper" Cianter  was shot twice in the chest with a shotgun and died instantly. After realising he'd been caught off guard and not having had the chance to set up a formal battle plan, Jock Ross ran from the back of the tavern holding a machete in one hand and a pick handle in the other. Almost immediately he was hit in the foot by shotgun pellets. Staggering on he was then hit again in the head and chest and collapsed.{{sfn|Harvey|Simpson|1989|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2012}}{{sfn|Brown|2001a}}

Police responded after receiving reports that a man had gone berserk with a rifle at the Viking Tavern in Milperra and shots had been fired. The fighting continued for at least 10&amp;nbsp;minutes while police helicopters circled overhead with members of the public fleeing to the tavern and nearby properties as soon as the shooting started. The first of more than 200&amp;nbsp;police arrived 15 minutes after the fighting ended and cordoned off the area. Two Comancheros had died from shotgun wounds, another two Comancheros died after being shot with a [[Taurus (manufacturer)|Rossi]] [[.357 Magnum]] [[rifle]], two Bandidos died from shotgun wounds and a 14-year-old bystander, Leanne Walters, also died after being hit in the face by a stray .357 bullet. A further 28 people were wounded with 20 requiring hospitalisation. Bandidos [[Serjeant-at-Arms|sergeant-at-arms]], Colin "Caesar" Campbell, was shot six times and spent six weeks in intensive care before checking himself out. Four shotgun pellets remained in his body which were dug out by his wife before he fled to [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/indepth/caesar-campbell-comes-clean/story-fn2mt2ft-1225697156716 Caesar Campbell comes clean]  [[The Daily Telegraph]] 15 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell later claimed that the wife of one of the Comancheros had shot him several times with a handgun.

Mark Pennington, one of the first police officers on the scene, was later awarded $380,000 (2011: $1,026,500) compensation for psychological damage. Bandido Member John "Whack" Campbell never fully recovered from the injuries he received and in 1987 died in jail from complications. Jock Ross suffered a brain injury after being shot in the head. He lost much of his vision as well as the ability to read and write.{{sfn|Brown|2001b}} The Viking Tavern has since been renamed the Mill Hotel.

==Aftermath==

===Trial===
The court case following the "Milperra Massacre" was at the time one of the largest in Australian history.{{sfn|BBC News|1984}} In total 43 people were originally charged with seven counts of murder under the doctrine of "[[common purpose]]"{{sfn|BBC News|1984}} however, charges against 10 were dropped before trial and Bernard "Bernie" Podgorski, secretary of the Bandidos, was granted immunity after turning [[Turn state's evidence|Queen's Evidence]].{{sfn|Morton|Lobez|2010|p=book pages are un-numbered:alphabetical listing of topics}}
[[Solicitor]] Christopher Murphy acted for the Bandidos' members charged as a result of the incident. [[Greg James (judge)|Greg James QC]], as he then was, represented all but one of the Bandidos' members during their trial, that being Colin Campbell. Greg James QC was Juniored by a number of Juniors including John Korn, Kenneth Rosin, Andrew Martin, and Philip Young. Mr. Campbell was represented by Mr [[Greg Woods]] QC, as he then was. Anthony "Snoddy" Spencer, the Bandidos National President, hanged himself in prison before he could stand trial.

During the longest joint criminal trial in New South Wales history,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} 58 policemen provided security including armed members of the [[State Protection Group|Tactical Operations Unit]] who were stationed in the courtroom and witnesses required armed guards from the [[State Protection Group|Witness Security Unit]] to escort them home. With 31 accused, each by law able to reject 20 jurors without giving a reason, 1,500 jurors were called up and housed at the [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith Leagues Club]] to await selection. The first day of selection saw only five jurors accepted from 208 presented, the following day it was found that two were ineligible with justice Roden dismissing all five and ordering that jury selection begin again. Eventually some 1,000 jurors were presented before 12 were found acceptable to sit on the case.  More than two years later, on 12 June 1987, the jury delivered 63 murder convictions, 147 manslaughter convictions and 31 of affray. The judge in the case named the instigator of the violence as William "Jock" Ross, the "supreme commander" of the Comancheros, saying "Ross was primarily responsible for the decision that members of his club go to Milperra in force and armed".{{sfn|BBC News|1984}}

Ross received a life sentence for his role in the violence. Four other members of the Comancheros gang received life sentences for murder and 16 Bandidos received sentences of seven years for manslaughter. As the Bandidos arrested were charged in regards to all the deaths, this resulted in Colin Campbell being found guilty of the manslaughter of his own brother. Another Campbell brother, John "Wack" Campbell, died three years later from the injuries he received that day.  [[Commonwealth Games]] gold medallist boxer [[Philip McElwaine|Philip "Knuckles" McElwaine]] was found guilty only of affray, he was the only motorcycle club member to be acquitted of the manslaughter and murder charges that were brought against him.{{sfn|Simpson|Harvey|1989|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2012}}{{efn|McElwaine was a volunteer at the [[Police and Community Youth Club]] and police acted as character witnesses for him, stating that he was "a monument to the police boys' movement as a whole"{{sfn|Simpson|1986|p=5}}}} In 1989, three Comancheros successfully appealed their murder convictions with the charge quashed and reduced to manslaughter. In 1992, Ross was the last to be released after serving five years and three months.{{sfn|Morton|Lobez|2010|p=book pages are un-numbered:alphabetical listing of topics}}

===Changes to gun laws===
The Comancheros were notorious for carrying registered shotguns openly while riding.{{sfn|Brown|2001}} As a result of the [[massacre]], the ''New South Wales Firearms and Dangerous Weapons Act 1973'', which allowed registered owners the right to carry firearms in public, was subsequently amended to require "a good reason for the issue of a [firearm] licence".{{sfn|NSW Police Force}}{{efn|For example, rural landholders, members of an approved gun club and persons engaged in lawful business involving the use of firearms were deemed to have a good reason and the police could refuse to issue licences to any persons they saw as not having a good reason.}}

===Resumption of hostilities===
In a repetition of the circumstances that led to the Milperra massacre, in early 2007 more than 60 members of the [[Parramatta]] and [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]] chapters of the [[Nomads (motorcycle club)|Nomads]], previously affiliated with the Comancheros, defected to the Bandidos. The defection resulted in a new eruption of violence between the Comancheros and Bandidos involving fire-bombings and drive-by shootings.{{sfn|Kennedy|2009}} [[New South Wales Police]] set up Operation Ranmore to stop the violence escalating, which resulted in 340 people arrested on 883 charges as of January 2008.{{sfn|Brisbane Times|2008}}

==Dramatisation==
In 2002, Australian film maker [[Martin Brown (producer)|Martin Brown]] produced a documentary titled "1% One Percenters Search For A Screenplay" in an effort to raise interest for a big budget movie of the massacre. The documentary, first aired on 2 February 2003, follows Brown as he looks for screenwriters, funds and a director for his movie. It includes interviews with the police investigating officer, ex superintendent Ron Stephenson, Comanchero president "Jock" Ross, Bandido vice president "Bullets" and several other Milperra survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/netw/200502/highlights/248780.htm|date=2 February 2011|title=1% One Percenters Search For A Screenplay|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A television mini-series ''[[Bikie Wars: Brothers in Arms]]'', based on the book ''Brothers in Arms'' by  Lindsay Simpson and Sandra Harvey, screened on Australias  [[Network Ten]] in May 2012. The screenplay was written by [[Greg Haddrick]], Roger Simpson and Jo Martino. It is directed by Peter Andrikidis.{{sfn|Knox|2011}} It stars [[Callan Mulvey]], [[Matthew Nable]], [[Susie Porter]], [[Maeve Dermody]], [[Anthony Hayes (actor)|Anthony Hayes]], [[Todd Lasance]], [[Luke Ford (actor)|Luke Ford]], [[Jeremy Lindsay Taylor]], [[Damian Walshe-Howling]], [[Nathaniel Dean]] and [[Luke Hemsworth]].  Colin "Caesar" Campbell has criticized the series for a lack of consultation with those who were there, its incorrect chronology of events, errors in motives and the portrayal of "lazy stereotypes".{{sfn|Gridneff|2012}}

'''Minority Treaties'''{{Ref label|a|a|none}} refer to the [[treaty|treaties]], [[League of Nations mandate|League of Nations Mandates]],&lt;ref&gt;In the south West Africa Case the International Court of Justice noted that the mandates were always regarded as treaties or conventions. See International Law Reports, Elihu Lauterpacht, Cambridge University Press, 1971, {{ISBN|0-521-46382-3}}, page 93&lt;/ref&gt; and unilateral declarations &lt;ref&gt;In the Albanian Schools case the Permanent Court of International Justice held that Declarations made before the League Council were tantamount to a treaty. See International Human Rights in Context, Henry J. Steiner, Philip Alston, Ryan Goodman, Oxford University Press US, 2008, {{ISBN|0-19-927942-X}}, page 100&lt;/ref&gt; made by countries applying for membership in the League of Nations and United Nations. Most of the treaties entered into force as a result of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].

The treaties conferred basic rights on all the inhabitants of the country without distinction of birth, nationality, language, race or religion and protected the rights of all nationals of the country who differed in race, religion, or language from the majority of the inhabitants of the country. The country concerned had to acknowledge the clauses of the treaty: as fundamental laws of state; and as obligations of international concern placed under the guarantee of the League of Nations, or United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Background==
The protection of religious and minority rights had been a matter of international concern and the subject of protections ever since the days of the Peace of Westphalia.&lt;ref&gt;Essays on International Law and Organization, Leo Grossman, BRILL, 1984, {{ISBN|0-941320-15-4}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1878 Treaty of Berlin had a new type of provision that protected minorities in the Balkans and newly independent states Great Power recognition was nominally conditional on the promise of guarantees of religious and civic freedoms for local religious minorities. Historian Carol Fink argues:
:the imposed clauses on minority rights became requirements not only for recognition but were also, as in the cases of Serbia, Montenegro, and Romania, conditions for receiving specific grants of territory. &lt;ref&gt; Carole Fink, ''Defending the Rights of Others: The Great Powers, the Jews, and International Minority Protection'' (2004). p 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fink reports that these provisions were generally not enforced--no suitable mechanism existed and the Great Powers had little interest in doing so. Protections were part of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and became increasingly important after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Jackson Preece, "Minority rights in Europe: from Westphalia to Helsinki." ''Review of international studies'' 23#1 (1997): 75-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Paris Peace Conference the Supreme Council established 'The Committee on New States and for The Protection of Minorities'. All the new successor states were compelled to sign minority rights treaties as a precondition of diplomatic recognition. It was agreed that although the new States had been recognized, they had not been 'created' before the signatures of the final Peace Treaties.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar I. Janowsky, ''The Jews And Minority Rights, (1898-1919)'' (Columbia University Press, 1933), p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Clemenceau noted in an [[aide-memoire]] attached to the Polish treaty that the minority protections were consistent with diplomatic precedent:{{quote|This treaty does not constitute any fresh departure. It has for long been the established procedure of the public law of Europe that when a State is created, or when large accessions of territory are made to an established State, the joint and formal recognition of the Great Powers should be accompanied by the requirement that such States should, in the form of a binding International convention undertake to comply with certain principles of Government. In this regard I must recall for your consideration the fact that it is to the endeavors and sacrifices of the Powers in whose name I am addressing you that the Polish nation owes the recovery of its independence. It is by their decision that Polish sovereignty is being restored over the territories in question, and that the inhabitants of these territories are being incorporated into the Polish nation.... ...There rests, therefore, upon these Powers an obligation, which they cannot evade, to secure in the most permanent and solemn form guarantees for certain essential rights which will afford to the inhabitants the necessary protection, whatever changes may take place in the internal constitution of the Polish State.|&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QfPhO8SCjJsC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6HjqqX7krE&amp;sig=6Xc1jACLVJppqloLWNf4SOA7PwA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result#PPA92,M1 Stephen D. Krasner, ''Sovereignty,'' (Princeton UP, 1999], pp 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The new treaties gave minorities the right to appeal directly to the League or UN General Assembly. In the case of the Mandates and the UN Partition Plan for Palestine compromissory clauses provide for the International Court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/summaryofworkofl00leagiala Summary of the work of the League of Nations, January 1920-March 1922, League of Nations Union, 1922, page 4] and [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/res181.htm United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181, Part I. - Future Constitution and Government of Palestine, C. Declaration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029150108/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/res181.htm |date=2006-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Allies of World War I|victorious powers]] attempted to ensure the stable development of the region between defeated Germany and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], a region characterized by the existence of many ethnic groups and the emergence of new nations. The idea behind the Minority Treaties was that by subjecting those countries to the scrutiny of others and to the threat of [[International sanctions|sanction]] and [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]] from the newly created international body, the League of Nations, the rights of minorities would be safeguarded.

As with most of the principles adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilsonian]] [[Idealism (international relations)|idealist]] approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.

Many international law norms and customary practices developed in the inter-war years by the League of Nations are still in use today. The procedures for managing intrastate and inter-ethnic issues include international supervision, regional economic unions, minority protection, plebiscites, and territorial partition. The Palestine and Bosnian Partition Plans{{clarify|reason="Bosnian Partition Plans" is not a term commonly found to describe anything positive in 1990s Bosnia|date=September 2013}} and European Union practice are modern examples of conditioning recognition of statehood on human rights, democracy, and minority protection guarantees.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;see the discussion on pages 97-98 and footnote 353 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=aotUTOW1Q7UC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FCsXFeW8DX&amp;sig=i1flD_QV64KAgo6116B0CjpwPHE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA97,M1 Managing Babel: The International Legal Protection of Minorities in the Twentieth Century, Li-ann Thio, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2005] {{ISBN|90-04-14198-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilateral treaties==
There were several [[bilateralism|bilateral]] Minority Treaties, each signed between one of the countries in question and the League. The treaties were signed between the League and some of the newly established nations: [[Poland]], [[Yugoslavia]] (also known then as the ''Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes''), [[Czechoslovakia]]. Similar treaties were also imposed on [[Greece]] and [[Allies of World War I|Entente]]-allied [[Romania]] in exchange for their territorial enlargement, and on some of the nations defeated in the [[First World War]] ([[Hungary]], [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]]). At the same time, [[Albania]], [[Lithuania]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and, outside of Europe, [[Iraq]] were persuaded to accept minority obligations as part of the terms of their admission to the League of Nations.&lt;ref name="Preece"&gt;Jennifer Jackson Preece, ''[http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0260210597000752 Minority Rights in Europe: From Westphalia to Helsinki]'' Review of International Studies, 1997, Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish treaty (signed in June 1919, as the first of the Minority Treaties, and serving as the template for the subsequent ones)&lt;ref&gt;Aimee Genell, "[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=85981145976858 Were the Minority Treaties a Failure?]" - H-net 2005 review of Carole Fink. 2004. ''Defending the Rights of Others: The Great Powers, the Jews, and International Minority Protection''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-83837-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as either the '''[[Little Treaty of Versailles]]''' or the '''Polish Minority Treaty'''; the Austrian, Czechoslovak and Yugoslavian treaties are referred to as '''[[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of St Germain-en-Laye]]''' (1919); the Romanian treaty as the '''[[Treaty of Paris (1919)]]''', the Greek as the '''[[Treaty of Sèvres]]''' (1920); the Hungarian as the '''[[Treaty of Trianon]]''' (1920), the Bulgarian as the '''[[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]]''' (1919), and the Turkish as the '''[[Treaty of Lausanne]]''' (1923).&lt;ref name="Preece"/&gt; In most of the above cases the minority treaties were only one of many articles of the aforementioned treaties.

==System==
The Minority Treaties were the basis of the League's system of minorities. Their aim was to protect the minorities without alienating the majority of the countries' population. The procedure was centered on the Council of the League (rather than the more encompassing Assembly) which had the right and obligation to raise complaints of treaty violations. Individual Council members had the unique privilege of placing complaints on the agenda, even through the petitions for that could be sent from any source.&lt;ref name="Fink"/&gt; The majority of cases, however, has never been handled by the council. Before reaching the Council, the petition passed through: the minority section of the Secretariat which selected the petitions according to some criteria (prohibition of violent language, integrity of the state, complaints about specific violations...), tried a first mediation and asked for supplementary information; the special committee of three that was appointed by the council and had the faculty of:
# dismissing the petition;
# trying a second stage of mediation
# submitting the question to the Council, which had the opportunity to seek a final agreement between the parties.&lt;ref name=Motta&gt;Giuseppe Motta, Less of Nations. Central-Eastern European minorities after WW1, vol.1; http://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/59407&lt;/ref&gt; If the accused government and the League could not reach a satisfactory compromise, the final decision was referred to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] (most cases were solved by negotiations between affected governments before the International Court intervention).&lt;ref name="Fink"&gt;[[Carole Fink]], "The minorities question at the Paris Peace Conference" in ''The Treaty of Versailles: A Reassessment After 75 Years'', Manfred Franz Boemeke, Gerald D. Feldman, Elisabeth Gläser (eds.), Cambridge University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-521-62132-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zqj-oHp4KsgC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=versailles+minority+treaty+1919&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5iZRs5-pyk&amp;sig=jdFQMqbljRkd-GZKxFLImEC-h58 Google Print - p. 249 onward]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
The Minority Treaties, recognized as history's first minority treaties,&lt;ref name="Fink"/&gt; were an important step in protection of minorities and recognition of [[human rights]], bringing the subject to an international forum. In them, for the first time, states and international communities recognized that there are people living outside normal legal protection and who required an additional guarantee of their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within individual states itself may not be sufficient.&lt;ref name="Preece"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink"/&gt; Among issues successfully resolved by the Minority Treaties was the [[Åland crisis]].&lt;ref name="Preece"/&gt;

Nonetheless, the treaties were also subject to past and present criticism. The countries subject to the treaties saw it as limiting their [[sovereignty]] and infringing their right for [[self-determination]], as the League was allowed to influence national, religious and educational policy in those countries, and suggesting that they were not competent enough to deal with their internal matters. Further criticism centered on the treaties not being obligatory for the established countries (like France, Germany, United Kingdom or Russia). The Western countries, who dictated the treaties in the aftermath of the First World War, saw minority safeguards as unnecessary for themselves, and trusted that they could fulfill the "standard of civilization".&lt;ref name="Preece"/&gt; It was the new Central and Eastern European countries that were not trusted to respect those rights, and, of course, [[Bolshevik Russia]], still in the throes of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], was a separate case.

This inequality further offended the smaller countries. Finally, this inequality also meant that the minority rights were not seen as a universal right; it was exclusively a foreign policy issue, and thus populations that had no state to back up their claims were relatively disadvantaged when compared to ones backed up by a powerful state or group of interests.&lt;ref name="Preece"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boris Tsilevich, [http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2001/oct/euenlarge EU Enlargement and the Protection of National Minorities: Opportunities, Myths, and Prospects], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the decline of [[League of Nations]] in the 1930s, the treaties were increasingly considered unenforceable and useless. The League Council, charged with enforcing the various minority treaties, often failed to act upon complaints from minorities. There was an unwritten rule that state policies aimed at the [[cultural assimilation]] of minorities should be ignored as the "minor evil" with regard to the rights enshrined in the Minority Treaties when those policies were seen as guaranteeing the internal stability of the state concerned.

When the Council did review cases, the reviews were commonly dominated by the countries whose ethnic groups were affected and that tried not only to resolve the problem of mistreatment of their minorities but also score other political goals on the international scene, sometimes even sacrificing the very minority in question (German and Hungarian governments are recognized as having abused the system the most). Also, of course, the League, lacking its own army, could not coerce any state to adhere to its recommendations.&lt;ref name="Preece"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink"/&gt;

Even before [[Adolf Hitler]] seized control of Germany in 1933, the problems with the Minority Treaties were evident. Various European governments continued to abuse minorities, the latter loudly protested, their complaints were exploited by interested parties with ulterior motives, and the League interfered as little as possible.&lt;ref name="Fink"/&gt; The system suffered an apparent death blow with Poland's rejection of its treaty in 1934.

===Renewed interest===
Judge Sir Hersch Lauterpacht explained the legal effectiveness of the operation of this system of minority protection treaties. He pointed out the Court's determination to discourage the evasion of these international obligations, and its repeated affirmation of {{quote|the self-evident principle of international law that a State cannot invoke its municipal law as the reason for the non-fulfillment of its international obligations.|&lt;ref&gt;see [https://books.google.com/books?id=piU8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Og6Yhjh177&amp;sig=v8Utt8om8HvpwvZy2CO6a-8IlAE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA262,M1 The Development of International Law by the International Court, Hersch Lauterpacht, page 262]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The United Nations established a formal minority rights protection system as an integral part of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Plan for the Future Government of Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;A complete list of the various legal instruments still in force was compiled by the UN Secretariat in 1950. [https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=E/CN.4/367 E/CN.4/367 Symbol: E/CN.4/367, Date: 7 April 1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024041738/http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=E%2FCN.4%2F367 |date=24 October 2012 }} (see CHAPTER III THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER AND THE TREATIES CONCLUDED AFTER THE WAR, resolution 181(II) of 29 November 1947, "The Future Government of Palestine", pages 22-23)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BJg6T7SqJ1gC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=&amp;client=#PPR38,M1 Self-determination and National Minorities, Thomas D. Musgrave, Oxford Monographs in International Law, Oxford University Press, 1997], {{ISBN|0-19-829898-6}}, Table of Treaties, Page xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of the treaties was questioned by the [[United Nations Secretariat]] in 1950, but a modern-day Chairman-Rapporteur of the UN Working Group on Minorities subsequently advised that no competent UN organ had made any decision which that extinguish the obligations under those instruments. He added that it was doubtful whether that could even be done by the United Nations. The provision that 'No discrimination of any kind shall be made between the inhabitants on the ground of race, religion, language or sex.' is enshrined in a multitude of international human rights conventions and the UN Charter itself.&lt;ref&gt;see the discussion in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDMQllP5-zcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA119,M1 Justifications of Minority Protection in International Law, Athanasia Spiliopoulou Akermark, pages 119-122.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Li-ann Thio, a professor of international and human rights law at the National University of Singapore noted that many international law norms and customary practices developed in the inter-war years by the League of Nations are still in use today. She specifically addressed the procedures for managing intrastate and inter-ethnic issues through (1) international supervision, (2)supranational integration, (3)minority protection, (4)plebiscites, and (5)partitions. She cited the Palestine and Bosnian Partition Plans{{clarify|reason="Bosnian Partition Plans" is not a term commonly found to describe anything positive in 1990s Bosnia|date=September 2013}} and 1990s European practice as examples of conditioning recognition of statehood on human rights, democracy, and minority protection guarantees.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

The International Court of Justice performed a legal analysis of the status of the territory of Palestine in order to determine the applicable law, before seeking to establish whether that law had been breached. The Court said that in addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement
under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account had to be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. It noted that minority and religious rights had been placed under international guarantee by Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin, 13 July 1878, and observed that those "existing rights" had been preserved in accordance with the safeguarding provisions of Article 13 of the League of Nations Mandate and a chapter of General Assembly resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;See paragraphs 69, 70, and 129 of the International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion, Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory {{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021237/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] recognized the urgent need to respect and promote the rights of indigenous peoples affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States. It also noted that the rights affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples are, in some situations, matters of international concern, interest, responsibility and character. In many instances the minority rights treaties provided for arbitration and granted the International Court of Justice jurisdiction to resolve disputes.

Rashid Al-Din's figures give Batu and Subutai about 40,000 horsemen total when they invaded Central Europe in 1241 (including Turkic auxiliaries recruited since the conquest of Rus), divided into five columns (three in Hungary, one in Transylvania, and one in Poland).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'''other estimates:'''&lt;br&gt;70,000&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Carey states on p. 128 that Batu had 40,000 in the main body and ordered Subutai to take 30,000 troops in an encircling maneuver. Batu commanded the central prong of the Mongols' three-pronged assault on Europe. This number seems correct when compared with the numbers reported at the Battles of [[Battle of Legnica|Leignitz]] to the north and [[Battle of Hermannstadt|Hermannstadt]] ([[Sibiu]]) to the south. All three victories occurred in the same week.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;25,000&lt;ref name="Markó 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liptai 1985"/&gt;

Excerpt: "If we assume that each of the larger cities could field, say, between 3,000 and 5,000 men, we can arrive at a total of about 60,000 fighting troops. If we add to this another 40,000 from smaller towns and from the various Turkic allies in the Principality of Kiev, then the total coincides with the 100,000 estimated by S.M. Solov'ev in his ''History o Russia''. But then this is only a rough estimate of the ''potential'' number. We have no idea how many, towns and districts actually mustered troops- for instance, it seems highly unlikely that Novgorod sent any at all. Certainly none came to help their outpost at Torzhok. Perhaps then half or a quarter - or even a smaller fraction- of the total was the most the Russians could muster."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;hr
/&gt;b) ~10,000 soldiers (2,000–8,000 at Legnica)&lt;ref&gt;Numbers disputed, vary from as low as 2,000 to above 10,000; see [[Battle of Legnica]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;d) 10,000–15,000 soldiers (contemporary sources)&lt;ref&gt;Sverdrup, pp. 114–115, pp. 109–110, contains lists of cited estimates provided by various sources and historians as well as the author's own estimates. The estimates for the Hungarian army at the time of the first Mongol invasion vary from not far above 10,000 (Grassman), to 25,000 (Jackson), to 50,000 (Kosztolnyik), to 65,000 (Sinor), to 80,000 (Todd). For his part, Sverdrup finds 10,000 to be the most likely estimate of those listed, based on other army sizes of the time and the fact that the 10,000 figure is attested to in two primary sources.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''other estimates:'''&lt;br&gt;80,000&lt;ref name="Carey, Brian Todd, p. 124"&gt;Carey, Brian Todd, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;25,000&lt;ref name="Markó 2000"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Markó |first=László |title=Great Honours of the Hungarian State |year=2000 |publisher=Magyar Könyvklub |location=Budapest |isbn=963-547-085-1 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The '''Mongol invasion of Europe''' in the 13th century was the conquest of Europe by the [[Mongol Empire]], by way of the destruction of [[Early East Slavs|East Slavic]] principalities, such as [[Kievan Rus'|Kiev]] and [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Vladimir]]. The Mongol invasions also occurred in Central Europe, which led to warfare among [[fragmented Poland]], such as the [[Battle of Legnica]] (9 April 1241) and in the [[Battle of Mohi]] (11 April 1241) in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Thomas T.  Allsen|title= Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0StLNcKQNUoC&amp;pg=PA4|publisher= Cambridge UP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operations were planned by General [[Subutai]] (1175–1248) and commanded by [[Batu Khan]] ({{circa}} 1207–1255) and [[Kadan]] (d. {{circa}} 1261). Both men were grandsons of [[Genghis Khan]]; their conquests integrated much European territory to the empire of the [[Golden Horde]]. Warring European princes realized they had to cooperate in the face of a Mongol invasion, so local wars and conflicts were suspended in parts of central Europe, only to be resumed after the Mongols had withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Ögedei Khan]] ordered Batu Khan to conquer Rus' in 1235.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/chronicleofnovgo00michrich | title=The Chronicle of Novgorod 1016–1471 | publisher=London, Offices of the society | work=Michell | date=1914 | accessdate=4 June 2014 |author1=Michell, Robert |author2=Forbes, Nevell | page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main force, headed by [[Jochi]]'s sons, and their cousins, [[Möngke Khan]] and [[Güyük Khan]], arrived at [[Ryazan]] in December 1237. Ryazan refused to surrender, and the Mongols sacked it and then stormed [[Suzdalia]]. Many Rus' armies were defeated; Grand Prince [[Yuri II of Vladimir|Yuri]] was killed on [[Battle of the Sit River|the Sit River]] (March 4, 1238). Major cities such as [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Torzhok]], and [[Kozelsk]] were captured.

Afterward, the Mongols turned their attention to the steppe, crushing the [[Kypchak]]s and the [[Alans]] and sacking [[Crimea]].  Batu appeared in Ukraine in 1239, sacking [[Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi|Pereiaslav]] and [[Chernihiv]]. Most of the Rus' princes fled when it became clear resistance was futile. The [[Siege of Kiev (1240)|Mongols sacked Kiev]] on December 6, 1240, and conquered [[Galich, Russia|Galich]] and [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]]. Batu sent a small detachment to probe the [[Poles]] before passing on to Central Europe. One column was routed by the Poles while the other defeated the Polish army and returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eddie Austerlitz|title=History of the Ogus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aM1Kp--SXQC&amp;pg=PA27|year= 2010|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongols had acquired Chinese [[gunpowder]], which they deployed in battle during the invasion of Europe to great success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=43UzTvWVL8y40AHRy9CQDA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=tWAjAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=He+swept+his+hosts%2C+organized+to+a+very+high+level+of+efficiency%2C+armed+with+a+Chinese+invention%2C+gunpowder%2C+that+they+used+in+small+field-guns%2C+and+commanded+with+a+sense+of+strategy+quite+beyond+the+capacity+of+any+European+general&amp;q=gunpowder+field+guns|title=Continental stakes: marshes of invasion, valley of conquest and peninsula of chaos |author=Odette Keun|accessdate=2011-11-28 |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1944 |month= |publisher=Letchworth printers ltd. |location= |language= |isbn= |page=53 |pages= |quote=Ogdai Khan continued this stupendous career of conquests.

==Invasion of Central Europe==
The attack on Europe was planned and executed by Subutai, who achieved perhaps his most lasting fame with his victories there. Having devastated the various Rus' principalities, he sent spies into Poland and Hungary, and as far as eastern Austria, in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bitwa pod Legnicą Chwała Oręża Polskiego Nr 3. Rzeczpospolita and Mówią Wieki. Primary author Rafał Jaworski. 12 August 2006 (in Polish) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Having a clear picture of the European kingdoms, he prepared an attack nominally commanded by Batu Khan and two other familial-related princes. Batu Khan, son of [[Jochi]], was the overall leader, but Subutai was the strategist and commander in the field, and as such, was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against Rus' principalities.&lt;ref&gt;Bitwa pod Legnicą Chwała Oręża Polskiego Nr 3. Rzeczpospolita and Mówią Wieki. Primary author Rafał Jaworski. 12 August 2006 (in Polish) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He also commanded the central column that moved against Hungary. While [[Kadan]]'s northern force won the [[Battle of Legnica]] and [[Güyük Khan|Güyük's]] army triumphed in [[Transylvania]], Subutai was waiting for them on the Hungarian plain. The newly reunited army then withdrew to the [[Sajó]] river where they inflicted a decisive defeat on King [[Béla IV of Hungary]] at the [[Battle of Mohi]]. Again, Subutai masterminded the operation, and it would prove one of his greatest victories.

===Invasion of Poland===

The Mongols invaded Central Europe with three armies. One army defeated an alliance which included forces from [[fragmented Poland]] and their allies, led by [[Henry II the Pious]], [[Duke of Silesia]] in the [[Battle of Legnica]].

Surprise gave the Poles an initial advantage and they managed to kill many Mongol soldiers. When the invaders realized the actual numerical weakness of the [[Poles]], they regrouped, broke through the Polish ranks and defeated them. During the fighting, many Polish prisoners of war found ways to escape and hide in the nearby woods. The Polish defeat was partly influenced by the initially successful Polish knights having been distracted by looting.

King [[Wenceslaus I of Bohemia]] fled back to protect his kingdom after arriving late and discovering the devastation the Mongols caused in those places; gathering reinforcements from [[Thuringia]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] as he retreated.

===Invasion of Hungary===
{{main|First Mongol invasion of Hungary}}

The Hungarians had first learned about the Mongol threat in 1229, when [[Andrew II of Hungary|King Andrew II]] granted asylum to some fleeing Ruthenian [[boyars]]. Some Magyars (Hungarians), left behind during the main migration to the [[Pannonian plain|Pannonian basin]], still lived on the banks of the upper [[Volga]] (it is believed by some{{who|date=August 2018}} that the descendants of this group are the modern-day [[Bashkirs]], although this people now speaks a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language, not Magyar). In 1237 a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]], [[Friar Julian|Julianus]], set off on an expedition to lead them back, and was sent back to King Béla with a letter from Batu Khan. In this letter, Batu called upon the Hungarian king to surrender his kingdom unconditionally to the [[Tatar]] forces or face complete destruction. Béla did not reply, and two more messages were later delivered to Hungary. The first, in 1239, was sent by the defeated [[Cumans|Cuman]] tribes, who asked for and received asylum in Hungary. The second was sent in February 1241 by the defeated Polish princes.

Only then did King Béla call upon his magnates to join his army in defense of the country. He also asked the papacy and the Western European rulers for help. Foreign help came in the form of a small knight-detachment under the leadership of [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria]], but it was too small to change the outcome of the campaign. The majority of the Hungarian magnates also did not realize the urgency of the matter. Some may have hoped that a defeat of the royal army would force Béla to discontinue his centralization efforts and thus strengthen their own power.

Although the Mongol danger was real and imminent, Hungary was not prepared to deal with it; in the minds of a people who had lived free from nomadic invasions for the last few hundred years, an invasion seemed impossible, and Hungary was no longer a predominantly soldier population. Only rich nobles were trained as heavy-armored cavalry. The Hungarians had long since forgotten the light-cavalry strategy and tactics of their ancestors, which were similar to those now used by the Mongols. The Hungarian army (some 60,000 on the eve of the [[Battle of Mohi]]) was made up of individual knights with tactical knowledge, discipline, and talented commanders. Because his army was not experienced in nomadic warfare, King Béla welcomed the Cuman King Kuthen (also known as [[Kotony]]) and his fighters. However, the Cuman invitation proved detrimental to the Hungarians because Batu Khan considered this acceptance of a group he considered rebels as justifications for his invasion of Hungary. After rumors began to circulate in Hungary that the Cumans were agents of the Mongols, some hot-headed Hungarians attacked the Cuman camp and killed Kotony. This led the enraged Cumans to ride south, looting, ravaging the countryside, and slaughtering the unsuspecting Magyar population. The Austrian troops retreated to Austria shortly thereafter to gain more western aid. The Hungarians now stood alone in the defense of their country.

[[File:Battle of Mohi 1241.PNG|250px|thumb|right|Battle of Mohi in a Medieval-era depiction]]

The 1241 Mongol invasion first affected [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] (situated east and south of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]). Tens of thousands of Wallachians and Moldavians lost their lives defending their territories from the [[Golden Horde]]. Crops and goods plundered from Wallachian settlements seem to have been a primary supply source for the Golden Horde. The invaders killed up to half of the population and burned down most of their settlements, thus destroying much of the cultural and economic records from that period. Neither Wallachians nor the army of Hungary offered much resistance against the Mongols.&lt;ref name='VioletaEpure'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rocsir.goldenideashome.com/archiv/2004_1-2/2VioletaEpure2004.pdf |title=''Invazia mongolă în Ungaria şi spaţiul românesc'' |accessdate=2009-02-05 |last=Epure |first=Violeta-Anca |format=PDF |work=ROCSIR - Revista Româna de Studii Culturale (pe Internet) |language=Romanian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014083856/http://rocsir.goldenideashome.com/archiv/2004_1-2/2VioletaEpure2004.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The swiftness of the invasion took many by surprise and forced them to retreat and hide in forests and the enclosed valleys of the Carpathians. In the end, however, the main target of the invasion was the Kingdom of Hungary.&lt;ref name='VioletaEpure'/&gt;

The Hungarian army arrived and encamped at the [[Sajó]] River on April 10, 1241, without having been directly challenged by the Mongols. The Mongols, having largely concealed their positions, began their attack the next night; after heavier-than-expected losses inflicted by Hungarian crossbowmen, the Mongols adjusted their strategy and routed the Hungarian forces rapidly. A major Hungarian loss was imminent, and the Mongols intentionally left a gap in their formation to permit the wavering Hungarian forces to flee and spread out in doing so, leaving them unable to effectively resist the Mongols as they picked off the retreating Hungarian remnants. While the king escaped with the help of his bodyguard, the remaining Hungarian army was mercilessly killed by the Mongols or drowned in the river as they attempted escape. Following their decisive victory, the Mongols now systematically occupied the [[Great Hungarian Plain]]s, the slopes of the northern [[Carpathian Mountains]], and [[Transylvania]]. Where they found local resistance, they ruthlessly killed the population. Where the locale offered no resistance, they forced the men into servitude in the Mongol army. Still, tens of thousands avoided Mongol domination by taking refuge behind the walls of the few existing [[fortresses]] or by hiding in the forests or large marshes along the rivers. The Mongols, instead of leaving the defenseless and helpless people and continuing their campaign through [[Pannonia]] to Western Europe, spent the entire summer and fall securing and pacifying the occupied territories. On [[Christmas day]] 1241, the costly [[Siege of Esztergom (1241)|siege of Esztergom]] destroyed the capital and economic center of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], forcing the capital to be moved to [[Buda]]pest.&lt;ref&gt;"Genghis Khan: his conquest, his empire, his legacy"by Frank Lynn&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter, contrary to the traditional strategy of nomadic armies which started campaigns only in spring-time, they crossed the [[Danube]] and continued their systematic occupation, including [[Pannonia]]. They eventually reached the Austrian borders and the Adriatic shores in [[Dalmatia]]. The Mongols appointed a ''[[darughachi]]'' in Hungary and minted coins in the name of Khagan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Prawdin]], Gerard (INT) Chaliand ''The Mongol Empire'', p.268&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael Prawdin]], the country of Béla was assigned to Orda by Batu as an [[appanage]].
At least 20%-40% of the population died, by slaughter or epidemic. [[Rogerius of Apulia]], an [[Italian people|Italian]] monk and chronicler who witnessed and survived the invasion, pointed out not only the genocidal element of the occupation, but also that the Mongols especially "found pleasure" in humiliating local women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Bessel|author2=Dirk Schumann|title=Life after death: approaches to a cultural and social history of Europe during the 1940s and 1950s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NilW70Yol74C&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00922-5|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt; But while the Mongols claimed control of Hungary, they could not occupy fortified cities such as [[Székesfehérvár|Fehérvár]], [[Veszprém]], [[Tihany]], [[Győr]], [[Pannonhalma]], [[Mosonmagyaróvár|Moson]], [[Sopron]], [[Vasvár]], [[Újhely]], Zala, [[Léka]], [[Pozsony]], [[Nyitra]], [[Komárom]], [[Fülek]] and [[Abaújvár]]. Learning from this lesson, fortresses came to play a significant role in Hungary. King Béla IV rebuilt the country and invested in fortifications. Facing a shortage of money, he welcomed the settlement of Jewish families, investors, and tradesmen, granting them citizenship rights. The King also welcomed tens of thousands of Kun (Cumans) who had fled the country before the invasion. Chinese [[Fire Arrow|fire arrow]]s were deployed by Mongols against the city of Buda on December 25, 1241, which they overran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hMtbFlKW5AC&amp;pg=PT11&amp;dq=mongol+invasion+hungary+chinese+gunpowder&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cXUzTozgIqfb0QGPm42IDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTge#v=onepage&amp;q=mongol%20%20hungary%20chinese%20gunpowder&amp;f=false|title=This Is Rocket Science: True Stories of the Risk-Taking Scientists Who Figure Out Ways to Explore Beyond Earth |author=Gloria Skurzynski|accessdate=2011-11-28  |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |date= |year=2010 |month= |publisher=National Geographic Books |location= |language= |isbn=1-4263-0597-4 |page=1958 |pages= |quote=In A.D. 1232 an army of 30,000 Mongol warriors invaded the Chinese city of Kai-fung-fu, where the Chinese fought back with fire arrows...Mongol leaders learned from their enemies and found ways to make fire arrows even more deadly as their invasion spread toward Europe. On Christmas Day 1241 Mongol troops used fire arrows to capture the city of Buda in Hungary, and in 1258 to capture the city of Baghdad in what's now Iraq. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongolian invasion taught the Magyars a simple lesson: although the Mongols had destroyed the countryside, the forts and fortified cities had survived. To improve their defense capabilities for the future, they had to build forts, not only on the borders but also inside the country.  In the siege of [[Esztergom]], the defenses managed to hold off the Mongolians despite the latter having overwhelming numerical superiority and 30 siege machines which they had just used to reduce the wooden towers of the city.&lt;ref name="Poww"&gt;Stephen Pow, Lindsay -- Deep Ditches and Well-built walls. pp. 72, 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zark"&gt;Z.

Kosztolnyik -- Hungary in the 13th Century, East European Monographs, 1996.  p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; During the remaining decades of the 13th century and throughout the 14th century, the kings donated more and more royal land to the magnates with the condition that they build forts and ensure their defenses.

When routed on the banks of the [[Sajó]] river in 1241 by the Mongols, Béla IV fled to today's [[Zagreb]] in [[Croatia]]. Batu sent a few tumens (roughly 20,000 men at arms) under Khadan in pursuit of Bela. The major objective was not the conquest but the capture of the Arpad king. The poorly fortified Zagreb was unable to resist the invasion and was destroyed, its [[cathedral]] burned by Mongols.&lt;ref name="mirror.veus.hr"&gt;[http://mirror.veus.hr/stamps/1992/bula.html 750th Anniversary of the Golden Bull Granted by Bela IV]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428125414/http://mirror.veus.hr/stamps/1992/bula.html |date=April 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for a second invasion, [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]] was granted a royal charter or [[Golden Bull of 1242]] by King Béla IV, after which citizens of Zagreb engaged in building defensive walls and towers around their settlement.&lt;ref name="Klaić V"&gt;Klaić V., Povijest Hrvata, Knjiga Prva, Druga, Treća, Četvrta i Peta Zagreb 1982{{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongols' pursuit of Béla IV continued from Zagreb through [[Pannonia]] to [[Dalmatia]]. While in pursuit, the Mongols under the leadership of [[Kadan]] (Qadan) attacked [[Klis Fortress]] in Croatia in March 1242. Due to the strong fortifications of Klis, the Mongols dismounted and climbed over the walls using nearby cliffs. The defenders were able to inflict a number of casualties on the Mongols, which enraged the latter and caused them to fight hand to hand in the streets and gathered a sizable amount of loot from houses. As soon as they learned that King Bela was elsewhere, they abandoned the attack and split off to attack Split and Trogir.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas of Split, Historia Salonitana.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongols pursued Béla IV from town to town in Dalmatia, while [[Croatian nobility]] and Dalmatian towns such as [[Trogir]] and [[Rab]] helped Béla IV to escape. After their defeat against the Croatian soldiers, the Mongols retreated and Béla IV was awarded Croatian towns and nobility. Only the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] did not aid Béla IV in his escape from the Mongols. Some historians claim that the mountainous terrain of Croatian Dalmatia was fatal for the Mongols because of the great losses they suffered from [[Croat]] ambushes set up in mountain passes.&lt;ref name="Klaić V"/&gt; In any case, though much of Croatia was plundered and destroyed, long-term occupation was unsuccessful.

[[Saint Margaret of Hungary|Saint Margaret]] (January 27, 1242 – January 18, 1271), a daughter of Béla IV and [[Maria Laskarina]], was born in Klis Fortress during the Mongol invasion of Hungary-Croatia in 1242.&lt;ref name="građevinar"&gt;[http://www.casopis-gradjevinar.hr/dokumenti/200109/6.pdf Klis - A gateway to Dalmatia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718202355/http://www.casopis-gradjevinar.hr/dokumenti/200109/6.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasion of Austria===
The subjugation of Hungary opened a pathway for the Mongol Horde to invade [[Vienna]]. Using similar tactics during their campaigns in previous Eastern and Central European countries, the Mongols first launched small squadrons to attack isolated settlements in the outskirts of Vienna in an attempt to instill fear and panic among the populace.&lt;ref name="Viennana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapwalk2013.clevelandhistory.org/vienna/|title=Map Walk 20132013: The Conquests of the Mongols|publisher=''Cleveland History''|author=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309064952/http://mapwalk2013.clevelandhistory.org/vienna/|archivedate=2017-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1241 the Mongols raided [[Wiener Neustadt]] and its neighboring districts, located south of Vienna. Wiener Neustadt took the brunt of the attack and like previous invasions the Mongols committed horrible atrocities on the relatively unarmed populace. The Duke of Austria, [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria|Frederick II]], had previously engaged the Mongols in Olomouc and in the initial stages of the Battle of Mohi. Unlike in Hungary however, Vienna under the leadership of Duke Frederick and his knights, together with their foreign allies, managed to rally quicker and annihilate the small Mongolian squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter.

===Invasion of Bulgaria===
{{main|Mongol invasion of Bulgaria and Serbia}}
During his withdrawal from Hungary back into Ruthenia, part of Batu Khan's army invaded Bulgaria. A Mongolian force was defeated by the Bulgarian army under Tsar [[Ivan Asen II]].&lt;ref&gt;Андреев (Andreev), Йордан (Jordan); Лалков (Lalkov), Милчо (Milcho) (1996).

Велико Търново (Veliko Tarnovo): Абагар (Abagar). {{ISBN|954-427-216-X}}.pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt; A larger force returned to raid Bulgaria again the same year, though little is known of what happened. According to the Persian historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]], the Bulgarian capital of Tarnovo was sacked. This is unlikely, but rumor of it spread widely, being repeated in Palestine by Bar Hebraeus.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson. The Mongols and the West: 1221-1410. 2005. p.65&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of Bulgaria is mentioned in other contemporary sources, such as Philippe Mouskès, Thomas of Cantimpré and Ricoldo of Montecroce.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary documents indicate that by 1253, [[Kaliman I of Bulgaria|Kaliman I]] was a tribute-paying vassal of the Mongols, a status he had probably been forced to accept during the invasion of 1242.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

==European tactics against Mongols==
The traditional European method of warfare of [[melee]] combat between knights ended in catastrophe when it was deployed against the Mongol forces as the Mongols were able to keep a distance and advance with superior numbers.  The ''New Encyclopædia Britannica'', Volume 29 says that "Employed against the Mongol invaders of Europe, knightly warfare failed even more disastrously for the Poles at the [[Battle of Legnica]] and the Hungarians at the [[Battle of Mohi]] in 1241. Feudal Europe was saved from sharing the fate of China and Muscovy not by its tactical prowess but by the [[Ögedei Khan#Aftermath of Ögedei's death|unexpected death]] of the Mongols' supreme ruler, Ögedei, and the subsequent eastward retreat of his armies."&lt;ref name="inc2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZKIxAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Employed+against+the+Mongol+invaders+of+Europe%2C+knightly+warfare+failed+even+more+disastrously+for+the+Poles+at+Legnica+and+the+Hungarians+at+Mohi+in+1241.+Feudal+Europe+was+saved+from+sharing+the+fate+of+China+and+Muscovy+not+by+its&amp;q=china+muscovy|year=2003|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=978-0-85229-961-6|page=663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during the initial Mongol invasion and the subsequent raids afterwards, heavily armored knights and cavalry proved more effective at fighting the Mongols than their light-armored counterparts. During the [[Battle of Mohi]] for example, while the Hungarian light cavalry and infantry were decimated by Mongol forces, the heavily armored knights in their employ (such as the [[Knights Templar]]) fought significantly better.&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Sugar, Péter Hanák, Tibor Frank -- ''A History of Hungary''. p.27: "The majority of the Hungarian forces consisted of light cavalry, who appeared 'foreign' to the Western observers. Yet this army had given up nomadic battle tactics and proved useless when facing the masters of this style of warfare. Hungarian tactics were a mix of eastern and western military traditions, as were the ineffective walls of clay bricks and palisades. Two elements of the Hungarian defense had proved effective, however: close combat with mass armored knights and stone fortifications".&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Legnica]],  the Knights Templar that numbered between 65-88 during the battle lost only three knights and 2 sergeants.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter (2005).

A later legend arose in Europe about a mysterious [[Berthold Schwarz]] who is credited with the invention of [[gunpowder]] by 15th- through 19th-century European literature.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (2005), p.23&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is known that [[William of Rubruck]], a Flemish missionary who visited the Mongol court of [[Möngke Khan]] at [[Karakorum]] and returned to Europe in 1257, was a friend of English philosopher [[Roger Bacon]], who recorded the earliest known European recipe for gunpowder in his ''[[Opus Majus]]'' of 1267.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; et al.

==End of the Mongol advance==
In ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'', [[Winston Churchill]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But Asia too was marching against the West. At one moment it had seemed as if all Europe would succumb to a terrible menace looming up from the East. Heathen Mongol hordes from the heart of Asia, formidable horsemen armed with bows, had rapidly swept over Russia, Poland, Hungary, and in 1241 inflicted simultaneous crushing defeats upon the Germans near Breslau and upon European cavalry near Buda. Germany and Austria at least lay at their mercy. Providentially in this year the Great Khan died in Mongolia; the Mongol leaders hastened back the thousands of miles to [[Karakorum]], their capital, to elect his successor, and Western Europe escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=q4hmTuDtFKfy0gG19oT-CQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=8ZkMAQAAMAAJ|title=The great republic: a history of America |author=Sir Winston Churchill, Winston Spencer Churchill|editor=Sir Winston Churchill, Winston Spencer Churchill|accessdate=2011-11-28 |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1999 |month= |publisher=Random House |location= |language= |isbn=0-375-50320-X |page=7 |pages= |quote=But Asia too was marching against the West.

Germany and Austria at least lay at their mercy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the summer and autumn of 1241, most of the Mongol forces were resting on the Hungarian Plain. In late March, 1242, they began to withdraw. The most common reason given for this withdrawal is the Great Khan [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]]'s death on December 11, 1241. [[Ögedei Khan]] died at the age of fifty-six after a binge of drinking during a hunting trip, which forced most of the Mongolian army to retreat back to Mongolia so that the princes of the blood could be present for the election of a new great khan. This is attested to by one primary source: the chronicle of [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], who after [[Europeans in Medieval China|visiting the Mongol court]], stated that the Mongols withdrew for this reason; he further stated that [[God]] had caused the Great Khan's death to protect Latin Christendom.&lt;ref&gt;John of Plano Carpini, "History of the Mongols," in ''The Mission to Asia'', ed. Christopher Dawson (London:
Sheed and Ward, 1955), 44&lt;/ref&gt; By Carpini's account, a messenger would have to be able to make the journey from Mongolia to Central Europe in a little over 3 months at a minimum; according to Carpini, the messenger actually arrived in January, meaning he took about 1 month in the middle of winter. Carpini himself accompanied a Mongol party in a much shorter journey (from Kiev to Mongolia) during the summer and fall of 1246, where the party "made great speed" in order to reach the election ceremony in time, and made use of several horses per person while riding nearly all day and night. It took five months.&lt;ref&gt;Carpini, "History of the Mongols", 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid Al-Din]], a historian of the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]], explicitly states in the Ilkhanate's official histories that the Mongols were not even aware of Ogedei's death when they began their withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid al-Din, Successors, 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Rashid Al-Din, writing under the auspices of the Mongol Empire, had access to the official Mongol chronicle when compiling his history ([[Altan Debter]]). John Andrew Boyle asserts, based on the orthography, that Rashid Al-Din's account of the withdrawal from central Europe was taken verbatim from Mongolian records.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid al-Din, Successors, 10-11. Translated by John Andrew Boyle. Boyle's preamble notes: "There are not infrequent interpolations from the Mongolian chronicle, and he even adopts its faulty chronology, in accordance with which the events of the European campaign take place a year later than in reality. In the present volume, Juvaini is down to the reign of Mongke (1251-1259) Rashid al-Din's main authority, but with considerable additional material from other sources. Thus the earlier historian's account of the invasion of eastern Europe (1241-1242) is repeated almost verbatim and is then followed, in a later chapter, by a much more detailed version of the same events, based, like the preceding description of the campaigns in Russia (1237-1240), on Mongol records, as is evident from the orthography of the proper names."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory is that weather data preserved in tree rings points to a series of warm, dry summers in the region until 1242. When temperatures dropped and rainfall increased, the local climate shifted to a wetter and colder environment. That, in turn, caused flooding of the formerly dry grasslands and created a marshy terrain. Those conditions would have been less than ideal for the nomadic Mongol cavalry and their encampments, reducing their mobility and pastureland, curtailing their invasion into Europe west of the Hungarian plain,&lt;ref name="climate change"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate probably stopped Mongols cold in Hungary, Science News, Science Ticker: Climate, Anthropology|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/climate-probably-stopped-mongols-cold-hungary?tgt=nr|year=2016|work=By Helen Thompson|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803134208/https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/climate-probably-stopped-mongols-cold-hungary?tgt=nr|archivedate=3 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hastening their retreat.

The true reasons for the Mongol withdrawal are not fully known, but numerous plausible explanations exist. The Mongol invasion had bogged down into a series of costly and frustrating sieges, where they gained little loot and ran into stiff resistance. They had lost a large number of men despite their victories (see above). Finally, they were stretched thin in the European theater, and were experiencing a rebellion by the [[Cumans]] in what is now southern Russia, and the [[Caucasus]] (Batu returned to put it down, and spent roughly a year doing so).&lt;ref&gt;Rashid al-Din, Successors, 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue Europe's bad weather had an effect: Hungary has a high water table so it floods easily. An analysis of tree rings there found that Hungary had a cold wet winter in early 1242, which likely turned Hungary’s central plain into a huge swamp; so, lacking pastures for their horses, the Mongols would have had to fall back to Russia in search of better grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25606|title=Climatic and environmental aspects of the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary in 1242 CE|first1=Ulf|last1=Büntgen|first2=Nicola|last2=Di Cosmo|date=26 May 2016|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|issue=1|accessdate=28 April 2018|doi=10.1038/srep25606|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202010115/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25606|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of their reasons, the Mongols had completely withdrawn from Central Europe by mid-1242, though they still launched military operations in the west at this time, most notably the 1241–1243 [[Mongol invasion of Anatolia]]. In fact, Batu specifically decided against attending the kurultai in favor of staying in Europe, which delayed the ceremony for several years.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Saunders, ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1971), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Jack Weatherford]] claims that European survival was due to Mongol unwillingness to fight in the more densely populated German principalities, where the weather affected the glue and sinew of the [[Mongol bow]]s. However, a counter to this assertion is that the Mongols were willing to fight in the densely populated areas of Song China and India. Furthermore, the Mongols were able to conquer Southern China which is located in a tropical climate zone and would have received far more rainfall and humidity than anywhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Climate]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rain#Wettest known locations]]&lt;/ref&gt; The territory of Western Europe had more forests and castles than the Mongols were accustomed, and there were opportunities for the European heavy cavalry to counter-attack. Also, despite the steppe tactics of the Avars and early Hungarians, both were defeated by Western states in the 9th and 10th centuries. A significant number of important castles and towns in Hungary had also resisted the formidable and infamous Mongol siege tactics.

Sir [[John Keegan]] claimed the Mongols failed against the geographical and weather conditions of Europe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Mongol armies], ferocious though they were, ultimately failed to translate their light cavalry power from the semi-temperate and desert regions where it flourished in to the high-rainfall zone of Western Europe.  Whenever [they] encountered ... peoples living by intensive agriculture, accumulating thereby food surpluses which enabled them to sustain campaigns longer than the foraging nomads ever could, and breeding on their rich grasslands horses which outmatched the nomad pony in battle, [they] had to admit defeat.  Light cavalry conquerors were in time either forced back into the arid environment where nomadism flourished, as on the borders of Western Europe, or, as in China, corrupted by the softness of agricultural civilization and absorbed by it.&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Keegan (1987) [i]The Mask of Command[/i], Viking: London, page 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some historians believe that the reason for Batu's stopping at the Mohi River was that he never intended to advance further.&lt;ref name="deremilitari"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mongols in the West, Journal of Asian History v.33 n.1|url=http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/sinor1.htm|year=1999|work=By Denis Sinor|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901020511/http://deremilitari.org/resources/articles/sinor1.htm|archivedate=1 September 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had made the Russian conquest safe for the years to come, and when the Great Khan died and Batu rushed back to Mongolia to put in his claim for power, it ended his westward expansion. Subutai's recall at the same time left the Mongol armies without their spiritual head and primary strategist. Batu Khan was not able to resume his plans for conquest to the "Great Sea" (the Atlantic Ocean) until 1255, after the turmoil after Ögedei's death had finally subsided with the election of [[Möngke Khan]] as Great Khan. Though he was capable of invading Western Europe, he was no longer interested.

===Mongol infighting===
From 1241 to 1248 a state of almost open warfare existed between Batu, son of Jochi, and [[Güyük Khan|Güyük]], son of Ögedei. The Mongol Empire was ruled by a regency under Ögedei's widow [[Töregene Khatun]], whose only goal was to secure the Great Khanate for her son, Güyük. There was so much bitterness between the two branches of the family that Güyük died in 1248 on his way to confront Batu to force him to accept his authority. He also had problems in his last years with the Principality of Halych-Volhynia, whose ruler, [[Danylo of Halych]], adopted a policy of confronting the Golden Horde and defeated some Mongol assaults in 1254. He was only defeated in 1259, under the Berke's rule. Batu Khan was unable to turn his army west until 1255, after Möngke had become Great Khan in 1251, and he had repaired his relations with the Great Khanate. However, as he prepared to finish the invasion of Europe, he died. His son did not live long enough to implement his father and Subutai's plan to invade Europe, and with his death, Batu's younger brother [[Berke]] became Khan of the [[Kipchak Khanate]]. Berke was not interested in invading Europe as much as halting his cousin [[Hulagu Khan]] from destroying the [[Holy Land]]. Berke had converted to Islam and watched with horror as his cousin destroyed the [[Abbasid Caliph]], the spiritual head of Islam as far as Berke was concerned. The [[Mamluk]]s of Egypt, learning through spies that Berke was both a Muslim and not fond of his cousin, appealed to him for help and were careful to nourish their ties to him and his Khanate.

Both entities were [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] in origin.&lt;ref name="Amitai-Preiss"&gt;Amitai-Preiss, Reuven. ''The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War''&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Mamluks were of Turkic descent and Berke's Khanate was almost totally Turkic also. Jochi, Genghis Khan's oldest son, was of disputed parentage and only received 4,000 Mongol warriors to start his Khanate. His nearly 500,000 warriors were virtually all [[Turkic people]] who had submitted to the Mongols. Thus, the Khanate was Turkic in culture and had more in common with their Muslim Turkic Mamluks brothers than with the Mongol [[shamanist]] Hulagu and his horde. Thus, when Hulagu Khan began to mass his army for war against the Mamluk-controlled Holy Land, they swiftly appealed to Berke Khan who sent armies against his cousin and forced him to defend his domains in the north.

Hulagu returned to his lands by 1262, but instead of being able to avenge his defeats, had to turn north to face Berke Khan, suffering severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the Caucasus in 1263, after Berke Khan had lured him north and away from the Holy Land. Thus, the Kipchak Khanate never invaded Europe; keeping watch to the south and east instead. Berke only sent troops into Europe twice, in two relatively light raids in 1259 and 1265, simply to collect booty he needed to pay for his wars against Hulagu from 1262-65.

==Europe at the time of the Mongol Invasion==
The Papacy had rejected the pleas of Georgia in favor of launching crusades in Spain and the Middle East, as well as preaching a Crusade against Kievan Rus in 1238 for refusing to join his earlier Balkan Crusade. Meanwhile, [[Emperor Frederick II]], a well-educated ruler, wanted to annex Italy to unite his separated kingdoms of Germany and Sicily. In addition to calling a council to depose the Holy Roman Emperor, Pope Gregory IX and his successor Innocent IV excommunicated Frederick four times and labeled him the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015); Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015); Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War (2016). pp. 448-51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1240s the efforts of Christendom were already divided between five Crusades, only one of which was aimed against the Mongols. Initially when Bela sent messengers to the Pope to request a Crusade against the Mongols, the Pope tried to convince them to instead join his Crusade against the Holy Roman Emperor. Eventually Pope Gregory did promise a Crusade and the Church finally helped sanction a small Crusade against the Mongols in mid-1241, but it was diverted when he died in August 1241. Instead of fighting the Mongols, the resources gathered by the Crusade was used to fight a Crusade against the Hohenstaufen Dynasty after the German barons revolted against the Holy Roman Emperor's son Conrad in September 1241.&lt;ref&gt;Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015); Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015); Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War (2016). pp. 450-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later raids==
The [[Golden Horde]] raids in the 1280s (those in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland), were much greater in scale than anything since the 1241–1242 invasion, due to the lack of civil war in the Mongol Empire at the time. They have sometimes been collectively referred to as "the second Mongol invasion of Europe", "the second Tatar-Mongol invasion of central and south-eastern Europe",&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson, "The Mongols and the West", 2005. Page 199&lt;/ref&gt; or "the second Mongol invasion of central Europe."&lt;ref name="Victor Spinei 1986. Pages 121-122"&gt;Victor Spinei. "Moldavia in the 11th-14th centuries." Editura Academiei Republicii Socialiste România. Bucharest, 1986. Pages 121-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against Poland (1259 and 1287)===
[[File:Meczennicy Sandomierscy.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Martyrdom of Sadok and 48 Dominican martyrs of Sandomierz during the Second Mongol invasion of Poland.]]

{{main|Second Mongol invasion of Poland}}
In 1259, eighteen years after the first attack, two tumens (20,000 men) from the [[Golden Horde]], under the leadership of Berke, attacked Poland after raiding Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;Stanisław Krakowski, ''Polska w walce z najazdami tatarskimi w XIII wieku'',  MON, 1956, pp. 181-201&lt;/ref&gt; This attack was commanded by general [[Burundai]] with young princes [[Nogai Khan|Nogai]] and [[Talabuga]]. [[Lublin]], [[Sieradz]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Zawichost]], [[Kraków]], and [[Bytom]] were ravaged and plundered. Berke had no intention of occupying or conquering Poland. After this raid the [[Pope Alexander IV]] tried without success to organize a crusade against the Tatars.

{{main|Third Mongol invasion of Poland}}
An unsuccessful invasion followed in 1287, led by [[Talabuga]] and Nogai Khan. 30,000 men (three tumens) in two columns under Nogai (10,000 Mongol cavalry) and Talabuga (20,000 Mongols and Ruthenians) respectively raided Lesser Poland to plunder the area and meet up north of [[Kraków]]. Lublin, [[Mazovia]], and [[Sieradz]] were successfully raided, but the Mongols failed to capture Sandomierz and Kraków and were repulsed with heavy casualties when they attempted to assault the cities, although the cities were devastated. Talabuga's main army (the rest of his column having dissolved across the countryside for raiding) was defeated by Duke [[Leszek II the Black|Leszek II]] at the [[Battle of Łagów]]. After this severe setback, Talabuga linked back up with the raiding parties and fled Poland with the loot that was already taken. Nogai's column, after suffering losses during the assault on Kraków, split up to raid the lands both north and south of the city. One detachment headed towards the town of [[Stary Sącz]], another to [[Podolínec]], and others to the [[Duchy of Sieradz]]. The first detachment was surprised and defeated by the Poles and their Hungarian allies in the [[Battle of Stary Sącz]], while the second devastated the area of [[Podhale]] while skirmishing with the locals. After the defeat at Stary Sącz, Nogai's whole column retreated into Ruthenia.&lt;ref&gt;Stanisław Krakowski, ''Polska w walce z najazdami tatarskimi w XIII wieku'', MON, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against Byzantine Thrace (1265, 1324 and 1337)===
{{main|Mongol invasion of Thrace}}
During the reign of Berke there was also a raid against [[Thrace]]. In the winter of 1265, the Bulgarian czar, Constantine Tych, requested Mongol intervention against the Byzantines in the Balkans. [[Nogai Khan]] led a Mongol raid of 20,000 cavalry (two ''tumens'') against the territories of Byzantine eastern Thrace. In the spring of 1265, [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] confronted the Mongols, but his smaller squadron apparently had very low morale and was quickly routed. Most of them were cut down as they fled. Michael was forced to retreat to Constantinople on a Genoese ship while Nogai's army plundered all of Thrace. Following this defeat, the Byzantine emperor made an alliance with the [[Golden Horde]] (which was massively beneficial for the latter), giving his daughter [[Euphrosyne Palaiologina (daughter of Michael VIII)|Euphrosyne]] in marriage to Nogai. Michael also sent much valuable fabric to Golden Horde as tribute.&lt;ref&gt;René Grousset The Empire of Steppes, page 399-400&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during [[Uzbeg Khan]] reign Thrace suffered raids in 1324 and 1337.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Sinor, "The Mongols in the West." ''Journal of Asian History'' (1999) pp: 1-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against Bulgaria (1271, 1274, 1280 and 1285)===
The successors of Tsar Ivan Asen II – the regency of Kaliman Asen I decided to pay tax to the [[Golden Horde]]. In 1271 Nogai Khan led a successful raid against the country, which was a vassal of the Golden Horde until the early 14th century. Bulgaria was again raided by the Tatars in 1274, 1280 and 1285. In 1278 and 1279 Tsar [[Ivailo]] lead the Bulgarian army and crushed the Mongol raids before being surrounded at [[Silistra]].&lt;ref&gt;Андреев (Andreev), Йордан (Jordan); Лалков (Lalkov), Милчо (Milcho) (1996).

In 1280 a rebellion inspired by Byzantium left [[Ivailo]] without much support, and so he fled to [[Nogai Khan|Nogai]]'s camp, asking him for help before being killed by the Mongols. Tsar [[George I of Bulgaria|George I]], however, became a Mongol vassal before the Mongol threat was finally ended with the reign of [[Theodore Svetoslav]].
[[File:MongolsInHungary1285.jpg|thumb|Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1285]]

===Against Hungary (1285)===
{{Main|Second Mongol invasion of Hungary}}

In 1285 Nogai Khan led a raid of Hungary alongside [[Talabuga]]. Nogai lead an army that ravaged [[Transylvania]] with success: Cities like [[Reghin]], [[Brașov]] and [[Bistrița]] were plundered and ravaged. However Talabuga, who led the main army in Northern Hungary, was stopped by the heavy snow of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and the invading force was defeated&lt;ref&gt;Pál Engel, Tamás Pálosfalvi, Andrew Ayton: ''The Realm of St. Stephen: A History of Medieval Hungary, 895-1526'', I.B.Tauris &amp; Co Ltd, London, pp. 109
[https://books.google.com/books?id=vEJNBqanT_8C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=mongol+ladislaus+hungary+1285&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LScqT-CyGKuTiAfZodDGDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22in%201285%20he%20succeeded%20in%20driving%20back%20the%20second%20Mongol%20invasion%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] by the royal army of [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]] and ambushed by the [[Székely]] in the return. Nogai's own column suffered serious casualties at the hands of the local troops (Saxons and Vlachs), and was harried on his withdrawal by the royal army, fresh from their victory over Talabuga. As with later invasions, it was repelled handily, the Mongols losing much of their invading force. The outcome could not have contrasted more sharply with the 1241 invasion, mostly due to the reforms of [[Béla IV of Hungary|Béla IV]], which included advances in military tactics and, most importantly, the widespread building of stone [[castle]]s, both responses to the defeat of the Hungarian Kingdom in 1241. The failed Mongol attack on Hungary greatly reduced the Golden Horde's military power caused them to stop disputing Hungarian borders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DTxu6RxdecUC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=cumans+fierce&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ThHdU_jQE4OJ7AbqkYGAAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=cumans&amp;f=false The Roots of Balkanization: Eastern Europe C.E. 500-1500 - By Ion Grumeza] Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Victor Spinei 1986.

===Against Serbia (1291)===
{{Main|Second Mongol invasion of Serbia}}

[[File:Victory of king Milutin over Tatars.jpg|thumb|200px|Serbian king Uroš II Milutin after victory over Mongols.]]
In 1291 a large Mongol-Bulgarian alliance raided into Serbia, where Serbian king [[Stefan Uroš II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Uroš II Milutin]] defeated them. However, the Serbian king acknowledged Nogai's supremacy and sent his son as hostage to prevent further hostility when Nogai threatened to lead a punitive expedition himself.&lt;ref&gt;István Vásáry ''Cumans and Tatars: Oriental military in the pre-Ottoman Balkans, 1185–1365'', p.89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter-Invasions of Europe===
By the mid-14th century the grip of the Golden Horde over Central and Eastern Europe had started to weaken. Several European kingdoms started various incursions into Mongol-controlled lands with the aim of reclaiming captured territories as well as add new ones from the Empire itself. The Kingdom of Georgia, under the leadership of  King [[George V the Brilliant]], restored Georgian dominance in their own lands and even took the [[Empire of Trebizond]] from Mongol hands.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kldiashvili, ''History of the Georgian Heraldry'', Parlamentis utskebani, 1997, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithuania]], taking advantage of internal strifes in the Golden Horde, started an invasion of their own, defeating the Mongols at the [[Battle at Blue Waters]], as well as conquering territories of the Golden Horde such as the [[Principality of Kiev]] all the way to the Dnieper River, before being halted after their defeat at the [[Battle of the Vorskla River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Borys |last=Cherkas |url=http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2011/12/30/66894/ |script-title=uk:Битва на Синіх Водах.

(1994). ''East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000–1500''. [[University of Washington Press]]. p. 380. {{ISBN|0-295-97290-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia also started to reclaim many Rus lands. In 1345, the Kingdom of Hungary, took the initiative and launched their own invasion force into Mongolian territory, capturing what would become [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kortüm, Hans-Henning. ''Transcultural Wars: from the Middle Ages to the 21st Century'' Akademie Verlag (March 22, 2006). p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

By this point, some Western European armies also started to meet the Mongols in their conquered territories. In [[Caffa]] for example, when the Mongols under [[Janibeg]] besieged it after a large fight between Christians and Muslims began, a relief force of an Italian army came and defeated the Mongols, killing 15,000 of their troops and destroying their siege engines. A year later, the Italians blockaded Mongol ports in the region, forcing Janibeg to negotiate, and in 1347 the Italians were allowed to reestablish their colony in Tana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/9/01-0536_article|title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa|first=Mark|last=Wheelis|date=1 September 2002|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=8|issue=9|pages=971–975|accessdate=28 April 2018|doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307230023/https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/9/01-0536_article|archivedate=7 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seybold Seminars''' was a leading seminar and "the premier trade show for the desktop publishing and pre-press industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Charles| last = Piller| title = The Web and the Future of Desktop Publishing| work = Los Angeles Times| date = 1996-09-23| accessdate = 2010-09-14| url = http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-23/business/fi-46769_1_desktop-publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1981 by Jonathan Seybold, son of the printing innovator [[John W. Seybold]], and complemented Seybold Publications, a branch of the Seybold business that was known for its influential ''Seybold Report'' newsletters.

Seybold Seminars focused on electronic publishing, printing and graphics. Its biannual events covered the industry in rapid transformation by computing technology and created a forum for theoretical discussion as well as practical applications of that technology. Initially focusing on the issues surrounding computers delivering images and text to print, the Seminars came to deal with a much wider range of new issues and technology as publishers embraced multimedia, online publishing, and rapid advances in color technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Seybold San Francisco '94| work = Newsbytes| location = San Francisco| date = 1994-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Seybold successes: New York move; melds print, new media| work = The Cole Papers| accessdate = 2010-05-23| date = May 1997| url = http://www.colepapers.net/TCP.archive/Cole_Papers_97/TCP_97_05/seybold.HTML}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web became a dominant concern in May 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Cole| first = David| title = Web discussions dominate 15th annual Seybold Seminars| work = The Cole Papers| accessdate = 2011-07-09| date = May 1995| url = http://www.colepapers.net/TCP.Archive/Cole_Papers_95/TCP_95_05/seybold.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''strategic steam reserve''' (SSR) is a collection of withdrawn [[steam locomotive]]s which is kept in working order for possible use in a national emergency. During the [[Cold War]] several countries, including [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], kept SSRs and the [[United Kingdom]] is reported to have done so, albeit without hard evidence.

== Need for a SSR ==
Many European railways have a large mileage which is [[Railway electrification system|electrified]].  In the event of a war, or major natural disaster, electricity supplies could be disrupted and [[electric locomotive]]s would be unworkable.  [[Diesel locomotive]]s could also be at risk for two reasons:
* Supplies of imported oil might be cut off,
* [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] components in diesel locomotives might be destroyed by the [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) from a [[nuclear weapon]]. In practice, locomotives of this period contained no such sensitive components.

== Feasibility ==
Although the availability and even storage of large numbers of steam locomotives would be practical (at least, on the scale of other Cold War strategic projects), the overall usefulness of such a reserve is far less practical.

* Steam locomotives require an infrastructure for their coaling, maintenance and especially water supply. This infrastructure was mostly dismantled with the withdrawal of the locomotives.
* Trained footplate crews might be drawn from the ranks of those previously experienced with steam, although their numbers will inevitably reduce over time. There would also be a need for ongoing refresher training.
* Certification of boilers involves a boiler certificate, issued for a fixed period of usually ten years. Even in storage, such boilers degrade by corrosion and would require a policy of careful storage, inspection and at least some maintenance.

== The British 'Strategic Reserve' ==
The alleged British 'Strategic Reserve' is a potent and frequently recurring [[urban myth]] amongst railway enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="Box, Jeep" &gt;http://www.willys-mb.co.uk/strategic-reserve.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwayscene.co.uk/showthread.php?thread=4657 RailwayScene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lner.info/forums/strategic-reserve-t455s0.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |title=The Strategic Reserve: A Practical Consideration
  |journal=Labyrinth magazine

  |title=On the Trail of the Strategic Reserve
  |url=http://www.angelfire.com/mn2/Oubliette/StratReserve.html
  |author=Rory Lushman
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the complete [[Steam_locomotives_of_British_Railways#Withdrawal|withdrawal of mainline steam traction in 1968]], the myth persisted for decades that a reserve of locomotives had been retained for such a strategic purpose. As no official reserve existed, nor was any reserve obviously visible, this encouraged many fanciful explanations for where the reserve might be hidden, usually in some tunnel or mine. One theory even claimed that the growing [[Heritage railway|steam preservation movement]] was itself the Strategic Reserve. 

Some support for these theories was given by the young age and high quality of the British locomotive fleet. The British Railways Standard classes were the pinnacle of British locomotive design and had been constructed until only a few years before withdrawal, even after the withdrawal of steam had been planned. Rather than applying [[Hanlon's razor]] to this evident wastefulness, the assumption was that there must have been some other secret justification to constructing a fleet of new, capable and standardised locomotives.

Another theory was that the reserve comprised the [[National Coal Board|NCB]]'s continued operational fleet of [[Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST|Austerity saddle tank]] locomotives. The Austerities were solidly constructed, reliable and easy to maintain; despite slow speed and short range, they were also powerful in terms of [[tractive effort]]. They were the last [[standard gauge]] steam locomotives to be constructed in the UK in the 20th Century, and were in a good condition, especially regarding their projected boiler life remaining. As they had also been operated by [[Royal Corps of Transport|the Army]] themselves, this was taken as further "evidence" to support the theory, amongst the fringes of rail enthusiasts.

In fact all scrapped steam locomotives have been accounted for, and the alleged hiding places, for example [[Box Tunnel]]&lt;ref name="Box, Jeep" /&gt;, proved to be innocuous. In 2008, [[BBC Radio 4]]'s  programme ''[[Punt PI]]'', with [[Steve Punt]], investigated the alleged Strategic Reserve, but found no evidence for its existence.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

'''Stålboga Summer Opera''' (Swedish: '''Stålboga sommaropera''') is an annual event staged at the privately owned Stålboga Manor House on a small peninsula in the lake Eklången 35 kilometers from [[Eskilstuna]] and 100 kilometers from [[Stockholm]], Sweden.

==Mill and manor house==

Stålboga was a well known farm back in the 15th century. In 1560, the farm is included on the road map commissioned by king [[Gustav I of Sweden]]. On the  earliest known detailed map of the province of [[Södermanland]] (Behmebergkartan) from 1625 Stålboga is indicated as an iron mill. Stålboga Mill was officially founded in 1641 and the mansion was erected around this time. On 17 September 1650 [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]] issued a nobility letter for Stålboga Mill, which included tax exemption. The preserved document is issued on parchment with a large royal seal. From the late 17th century the land area of the property was approximately 5,000 hectares, with its own blast furnace and iron mine. The mansion burned down in 1870 and was not rebuilt until 1984-85.&lt;ref name="dunker"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dunker.nu/Stalbogabruk.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908184024/http://www.dunker.nu/Stalbogabruk.htm |title=Stålboga bruk |publisher=Dunker Parish database |language=Swedish |archivedate=2016-09-08 |accessdate=2016-09-08 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mill operation included [[rod iron]] forging, Lancashire [[pig iron]], cannons and cannonballs, and carriages. A [[rolling mill]] was erected in the 19th century, and a railway station on the Stockholm to Eskilstuna line was built in the 1890s to promote goods transport from the mill. Mill operations stopped in the 1890s. The forest company [[Holmen (company)|Holmen]] bought Stålboga in 1910.&lt;ref name="dunker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hembygd.se/malmkoping/har-verkar-var-forening/dunkers-socken |title=Dunkers socken |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908184025/http://www.hembygd.se/malmkoping/har-verkar-var-forening/dunkers-socken |publisher=Sveriges Hembygdsförbund |language=Swedish |archivedate=2016-09-08 |accessdate=2016-09-08 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dr. Juto and his wife Dr. Maria Juto, who died in 2011, bought the central part of the estate with 500 hectares in 1979. They bought and moved the 1680s Tunafors mansion house from Eskilstuna and placed it on the old Stålboga foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/groena-kusten/pressreleases/aarets-soermlaenning-2011-685134 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908184028/http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/groena-kusten/pressreleases/aarets-soermlaenning-2011-685134 |title=Årets Sörmlänning 2011 |publisher=Gröna Kusten |language=Swedish |archivedate=2016-09-08 |accessdate=2016-09-08 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music pavilion==
[[File:Stålboga Paviljong.jpg|right|thumb|Stålboga pavilion 2014. Photo by Nils Juto.]]
Dr. Juto, [[ophthalmologist]] and an avid classical music fan, decided in 2005 to build a music [[pavilion]] on the Stålboga premises with the idea of staging intimate music events of the highest possible standard. As a starting point Dr. Juto was able to acquire the late 18th century [[state room]] interiors of the [[De Geer]] family's great city palace in Stockholm, razed in 1926 to make way for the new headquarters of Swedish industrialist [[Ivar Kreuger|Ivar Kreuger's]] match business, the predecessor of [[Swedish Match]]. The interiors were designed by the same interior designers that were at the same time designing the interior of the [[Stockholm Palace|Royal Palace]] in Stockholm: [[Jean Eric Rehn]], [[Jean Baptiste Masreliez]], [[Adrien Masreliez]], [[Christoffer Gjörwell]] and [[Nicodemus Tessin the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stalbogabruk.se/paviljong/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905184455/http://www.stalbogabruk.se/paviljong/ |publisher=Stålboga Bruk |title=Paviljongen |language=Swedish |archivedate=2016-09-05 |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of construction of the music pavilion the interior decorations had then been stored for 80 years at the De Geer family's estate at [[Lövstabruk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sormlandsbygden.se/2011/09/arets-sormlanning-fran-stalboga-bruk/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905190712/http://sormlandsbygden.se/2011/09/arets-sormlanning-fran-stalboga-bruk/ |title=Årets Sörmlänning från Stålboga bruk |author=Helena Wistrand |publisher=Sörmlandsbygden |language=Swedish |date=1 September 2011 |archivedate=2016-09-05 |accessdate=2016-09-05|deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior of the music pavilion is inspired by the [[orangerie]] at the [[Ulriksdal Palace]] and [[Gustav III's Pavilion]], both near Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knorring.se/stalboga.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908184028/http://www.knorring.se/stalboga.htm |title=Stålboga, Flen, Fest- och musikpaviljong |publisher=Peter von Knorring arkitektkontor |language=Swedish |archivedate=2016-09-08 |accessdate=2016-09-08 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pavilion was built by the same carpenters who rebuilt the dome of [[Katarina Church]] in Stockholm after the fire in 1990, with Swedish timber from [[Dalarna]] using 18th century methods, including hand forged nails. The pavilion was developed with advice from the company responsible for the acoustics of the [[Gothenburg Opera]].

==Summer opera==
[[File:Cosi fan tutte opera.jpg|right|thumb|Cosí fan tutte, 7 September 2014]]
[[File:Stalboga exterior.jpg|thumb|Stålboga pavilion 15 August 2015; intermission]]
The Summer Opera started in 2013 as an independent project sponsored by Dr. Juto, the owner of the Stålboga Manor House. The opera concept usually includes dinner and wine in the ticket price.

Given the limited size of the music pavilion, the total number of singers cannot readily exceed ten at the most. Also, the space available for the orchestra is very limited. Management has therefore chosen a repertoire with limited cast and orchestra requirements, and has strived to find plots that harmonize with the intimate character of the 17th century interior. For the first seasons the orchestral part has been played on piano and cembalo, with the piano confined to [[aria]]s and the cembalo used for the [[recitative]].&lt;ref name="operapågång"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ekuriren.se/kulturnoje/1.1888400-opera-pa-gang-i-paviljong |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140907162306/http://ekuriren.se/kulturnoje/1.1888400-opera-pa-gang-i-paviljong |archive-date=7 September 2014 |title=Opera på gång i paviljong |author=Therése Norén |publisher=Eskilstuna-Kuriren |language=Swedish |date=26 August 2013 |accessdate=7 September 2014 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The productions at Stålboga have included opera singers such as soprano [[Hillevi Martinpelto]], mezzo [[Katarina Karnéus]], the 1995 winner of the biennial [[BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition]], and the young rising star baritone [[Luthando Qave]] who made his [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan]] debut at age 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neue-stimmen.de/en/history/all-participants/participants-a-to-z/details/269/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905190132/http://www.neue-stimmen.de/en/history/all-participants/participants-a-to-z/details/269/ |publisher=Neue Stimme |title=Luthando Qave |archivedate=2016-09-05 |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The director for the first productions was the former Opera Director of [[Drottningholm Palace Theatre]], [[Per-Erik Öhrn]].&lt;ref name="operapågång"/&gt; In 2016 the Director was [[Mattias Ermedahl]] who is also a soloist [[baryton]] at [[GöteborgsOperan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.opera.se/om-oss/personal/portratt/mattias-ermedahl/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905185436/http://en.opera.se/om-oss/personal/portratt/mattias-ermedahl/ |publisher=GöteborgsOperan |title=Mattias Ermedahl |archivedate=2016-09-05 |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Art and video games}}

'''''The Art of Video Games''''' was an exhibition by the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] which was on display from March 16, 2012 through September 30, 2012. The exhibition was designed to highlight the evolution of art within the [[video game]] medium over its forty-year history. Following its time at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the exhibition toured to 10 additional venues in the United States. [[Chris Melissinos]], founder of Past Pixels and collector of video games and gaming systems, was the curator of the exhibition.

==Purpose==
''The Art of Video Games''&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Art of Video Games, http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first exhibitions to explore the forty-year evolution of video games as an artistic medium, with a focus on striking visual effects and the creative use of new technologies. It featured some of the most influential artists and designers during five eras of game technology, from early pioneers to contemporary designers (see grid below). The exhibition focused on the interplay of graphics, technology and storytelling through some of the best games for twenty gaming systems ranging from the Atari VCS to the PlayStation 3.

==Public vote==
The Smithsonian American Art Museum invited the public to help select the video games to be included in the exhibition. The 240 games on the ballot were selected by [[Chris Melissinos]], who worked with the museum and an advisory group consisting of game developers, designers, industry pioneers, and journalists. The games were selected based on a variety of criteria, including visual effects, creative use of new technologies, and how the game fit into the narrative of the exhibition. Voting took place between February 14 and April 17, 2011. More than 3.7 million votes were cast by 119,000 people in 175 countries.

==Galleries==
Visitors to ''The Art of Video Games'' at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] were greeted by a 12-foot projection that included excerpts from most of the 80 games featured in the exhibition with a chipmusic soundtrack written and recorded by [[8 Bit Weapon]] and [[ComputeHer]]. An interior gallery included a series of short videos showing the range of emotional responses players of all ages have while interacting with games. Five themed videos addressing the themes of Beginnings, Inspiration, Narrative, Experience and The Future showcased excerpts from interviews with 20 influential figures in the gaming world—[[Nolan Bushnell]], [[David Cage]], [[Steve Cartwright]], [[Jenova Chen]], [[Don Daglow]], [[Noah Falstein]], [[Ed Fries]], [[Ron Gilbert]], [[Robin Hunicke]], [[Henry Jenkins]], [[Jennifer MacLean]], [[RJ Mical]], [[Mike Mika]], [[David Perry (game developer)|David Perry]], [[Jane Pinckard]], George L. Rose, [[Kellee Santiago]], [[Tim Schafer]], [[Jesse Schell]], [[Warren Spector]] and [[Tommy Tallarico]]. The videos are also available on the museum’s website.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian American Art Museum, Exhibition Videos, ''The Art of Video Games'', {{cite web |url=http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/artists/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629123332/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/artists/ |archivedate=2017-06-29 |df= }} (retrieved 4-3-2012)&lt;/ref&gt; A five-channel installation displaying advances in core mechanics illustrated how home video games have evolved dramatically since their introduction in the 1970s through elements like avatars, jumping, running, climbing, flying, cutscenes and landscapes &lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian American Art Museum, ''The Art of Video Games'', {{cite web |url=http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/mechanics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511072009/http://www.americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/mechanics/ |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The room also held a selection of concept art from several games of different eras. Five playable games, one from each era, showed how players interact with diverse virtual worlds, highlighting innovative techniques that set the standard for many subsequent games. The playable games were [[Pac-Man]], [[Super Mario Brothers]], [[The Secret of Monkey Island]], [[Myst]], and [[Flower (video game)]]. Interactive kiosks in the final gallery covered five eras of game technology, from early pioneers to contemporary designers, and 20 gaming systems from Ataric VCS to PlayStation 3. Each kiosk featured a game from each of four genres—action, target, adventure and tactics—that visitors could select to listen to commentary, game dialogue and music.

==Games exhibited==

The following list of games are those that were selected by Melissinos and the advisory board for inclusion in the exhibition. The exhibition is divided into five chronological eras, showcasing platforms from within that era. For each platform, three games from each of four game genres were initially selected for inclusion, with one game determined by the public voting to be part of the final exhibition. In addition, playable versions of five games are available: ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]'', ''[[Myst]]'', and ''[[Flower (video game)|Flower]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian American Art Museum, ''The Art of Video Games'', Featured Games, {{cite web |url=http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/featuredgames/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203152720/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/featuredgames// |archivedate=2016-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Sundering''' is a fictional event set in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' [[campaign setting]] of the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]]. It is described in a series of novels and game supplements beginning in 2013 in anticipation of the newest version of the game, known at the time as ''D&amp;D Next''.&lt;ref name=forbes-aug-2012/&gt;

==History and development==

[[File:Thevar Jayanthi in Madurai, 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|Garlanding Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar's statue in [[Madurai]] during the 2007 Thevar Jayanthi centenary]]'''''Thevar Jayanthi''''', celebrated on 30 October, is an annual commemoration of the birthday of [[U. Muthuramalingam Thevar|Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar]]. It is celebrated in a grand way by the [[Thevar]] community in the southern districts of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/oct/28tn1.htm |title=Security beefed up in Madurai for Thevar Jayanthi |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not an official public holiday, many schools and businesses in the area remain closed on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/31/stories/2006103105270300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions peaceful |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2006 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/31/stories/2005103116560300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions pass off peacefully |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2005 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/31/stories/2007103159910300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions peaceful |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thevar's legacy==
Whilst having been active in politics, it is mainly the spiritual discourse of Thevar that explains his following after his death. Also, the fact that his date of birth and death lie some close to each other has been interpreted as a sign of supernatural powers.&lt;ref name="s"/&gt;

==Thevar Samadhi==
One of the main events on Thevar Jayanthi takes place at the ''samadhi'' (burial place) of Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar, located at some 50 miles distance from [[Madurai]]. Pilgrims gather to take part in the ceremonies at the ''samadhi'' on 30 October. In later years the ceremony at the ''samadhi'' has begun to attract prominent politicians.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;Robinson, Rowena. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2cIOqGcvHqoC&amp;pg=PA167 Sociology of Religion in India]''. New Delhi [u.a.]: SAGE, 2004. pp. 165-168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political controversy==
The [[All India Forward Bloc]], the [[political party]] to which Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar belonged, has demanded that Thevar Jayanthi be declared a public holiday in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/ar_showdetails.asp?id=710090655&amp;cat=&amp;n_date=20071009 |title=Mid term polls linked to Cong stand on US nuke pact: AIFB|publisher=webindia123.com |date=9 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event is not entirely uncontroversial. The [[CPI(ML) Liberation]] has charged that the Tamil Nadu government should stop sponsoring Thevar Jayanthi celebrations, claiming that the event is utilised by [[caste]]ist forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_2009/jan_09/reports.html |title=Kerala : Land Reforms Undone |publisher=[[Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation]]|date= |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 centenary celebrations==
On 30 October 2007, the birth centenary of Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar was celebrated. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[M. Karunanidhi]] took part in the celebrations in [[Pasumpon]] village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2007/10/30/karunanidhi-jaya-pay-floral-tributes-to-muthuramalinga-thevar-1193737346.html |title=Karunanidhi, Jaya pay floral tributes to Muthuramalinga Thevar|publisher=[[Oneindia.in]]|date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time in two decades that Karunanidhi participated in Thevar Jayanthi.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; At the celebrations, Karunanidhi suggested that [[Madurai Airport]] be renamed after Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar. These moves were seen as an attempt by Karunanidhi's [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) party to challenge the supremacy of the rival [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) over the Thevar community. The AIADMK leader [[J. Jayalalitha]] criticised Karunanidhi's participation in the Thevar Jayanthi centenary programme, stating that he did not believe in Thevar's ideas. Moreover, she claimed that her previous government had allocated 30&amp;nbsp;million [[Indian rupee|rupees]] for the Thevar Jayanthi centenary, but that Karunanidhi's government had spent only five million rupees.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianchristians.in/news/content/view/1732/48/ |title=New Icon, Old Wounds |publisher=All India Christian Council|date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2807">'''Twinkie''' is a racial pejorative used by most [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] to refer to a [[European American]], with little or no social or blood links to any tribe, who claims to be an American Indian. Particularly applies to those who claim to be [[shaman]], healers, or other prominent respected positions in Indian culture. They try to incorporate [[New Age]] ideas such as "Energy Healing", "Atlantis" and [[Tantric sex]] into a fanciful Native American spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mihesuah|first=Devon A.|title=American Indians: stereotypes &amp; realities|year=2002|publisher=Clarity|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=978-0-932863-22-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAgJx4Ag_jIC|edition=Reprint|page=70|quote=It's little wonder that Indians are closed-mouthed about their spirituality. Non-Indians claiming to be "spiritual leaders," "healers," and "medicine men and women" abound in this country, and these "crystal twinkies" (as a former Hopi student likes to call them) make a pretty decent living at deceiving the public.|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twinkieism is seen by many as an example of [[cultural appropriation]]. It is used as a humorous comment and not as a racial slur. Natives who fall for New Age falsehoods may also be teased as being "twinkies".{{cn|date=September 2015}}

Another use of the pejorative can be in describing [[Asian American|Asian Americans]] (along with others) who has become completely (or almost completely) integrated into [[White American]], or mainstream [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], thus losing their traditional [[Asian values]] (and etc.). A reference to "Twinkie" can be seen in the 2004 film ''[[Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', where Harold, a [[Korean American]], is referred to as a "Twinkie". This term is derived from the traditional metaphor "[[Banana (slur)|banana]]" and means "yellow on the outside, white on the inside". This term is also used in the film, ''[[Crazy Rich Asians]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Lee |editor-first=Jonathan H.X. |title=Encyclopedia of Asian American folklore and folklife|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-0-313-35066-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0sEJ_0vV1QC&amp;pg=PA88 |editor2=Kathleen M.

[[File:Overview of the festival terrain during the World Liberty Concert, as broadcasted live on televion on May 8th, 1995.jpg|thumb|Overview of the concert, showing the stage next to the bridge.]]The '''World Liberty Concert''' was a concert that took place on May 8, 1995 next to the [[John Frost Bridge]] in [[Arnhem]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The concert was held in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of Europe and is the largest memorial concert ever held in the Netherlands and was thought of by [[Arno Geul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadkill.com/APP/faq/#3.03 |title=The Alan Parsons Project List of Frequently Asked Questions: Okay, then what is the World Liberty Concert? |website=Roadkill Consulting |date=September 1996 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparations lasted for about a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theproductionfactory.eu/en/projects/world-liberty-concert |title=World Liberty Concert |website=The Production Factory |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narrative ===
[[File:Walter Cronkite narrating the World Liberty Concert, as broadcasted on television on May 8th, 1995.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Cronkite]] as he appeared during the television broadcast of the concert.]]
During the concert, [[Walter Cronkite]] [[Narrative|narrated]] parts of history during and after the [[World War II|Second World War]], in order to illustrate the historical meaning of the concert. During the concert Walter Cronkite was positioned at the side of the Rhine, in a military [[Jeep]].

In his initial appearance at the beginning of the concert, [[Walter Cronkite]] both describes the reason for his presence and the reason for the concert:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am here tonight, because as a [[war correspondent]], I was part of the [[Operation Market Garden|allied airborne operation]] that for a brief moment in history, more than fifty years ago, focused the world's attention on this [[John Frost Bridge|crossing of the Rhine]] and this Dutch City of [[Arnhem]]. I speak tonight from hallowed ground, for here more than 1500 brave [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|British parachutists]] died in a futile attempt to gain the bridge. 6000 were captured, many of them wounded. They represent for us tonight, the millions of others, soldiers, sailors, airmen and civilians, claimed in [[World War II|history’s worst calamity]]. In a war whose long delayed ending, this concert commemorates and celebrates. In May 1944 the [[Europe|European continent]] had been a major battleground for almost four years. The country's provinces, cities and more importantly the people of Europe were devastated by the toll of mankind’s [[World War II|Second World War]]. Beginning just 50 kilometers upstream from this City of [[Arnhem]], stretched the heartland of the aggressor's war industry. While the sounds of the factories were of course too far off to be heard from here, life was dominated by the ominous sound of a not so distant thunder.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In total, [[Walter Cronkite]] makes 11 appearances during the concert, covering the history in chronological order:
# Introduction and description of the situation of the region in 1944.
# Description of the [[Normandy landings]], and the significance of [[D-Day (military term)|D-Day]] as a turning point.
# [[Arnhem]] and its Rhine bridge was becoming a strategic focal point in the summer of 1944, which caused preparations for an operation to be made.
# Paratroops were dropped in [[Operation Market Garden]], but the effort failed.
# The defeat during [[Operation Market Garden]] destroyed the hopes and the city of [[Arnhem]].
# On may 5th 1945, the [[Netherlands]] were liberated and three days later the peeace treaty was signed.
# In June 1945 the [[United Nations]] was established, to maintain international peace and security.
# In 1995 the benefits of the [[United Nations]] are visible to us all.
# The [[European Union]] is a new reality and a growing world power.
# Much work is being done by organizations such as [[UNICEF]], for the youth of today, the world leaders of tomorrow.
# It is up to the next generation to accomplish world peace, which the current generation has failed to accomplish.
