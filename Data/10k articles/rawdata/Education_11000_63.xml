      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5158">[[File:Tom-Erdbeermarmeladenbrot-Band.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Tom and the slice of bread with strawberry jam and honey]]'''Andreas Hykade''' (born 1968 in [[Altötting]], [[Bavaria]]) is an animation director from Germany. Before studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Stuttgart]] from 1988 to 1990, he attended König-Karlmann-Gymnasium [[Altötting]]. He worked as an animator in London in 1991, then studied animation at the [[Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg]] until 1995. Since then he works as animation director, partly at "Studio Filmbilder" in Stuttgart, and as the Professor for Animation at the Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg.

Hykade's trademark style is based on very simple characters which move in smooth animation. Sometimes, like in the two music videos for [[Gigi D'Agostino]], there's just a line over a flat color, much like the classical ''[[La Linea (TV series)|La Linea]]''-character of [[Osvaldo Cavandoli]] (to which they are a loving homage). Often his characters feature single strokes as arms and legs, in this Hykade is similar to German comic artist {{Interlanguage link multi|OL (cartoonist)|de|3=OL (Cartoonist)|lt=OL}}.

"We Lived in Grass" (1995) is a student film and Hykade's first part of  The Country Trilogy. The set of the film is a place just two streets away from the end of the world. The film is told from the point of view of a little boy. "All women is whore and all men is soldier," the father of the boy says. "So go into Grass and kill a tiger for the best tits you can find." As the father gets testicular cancer, a journey into Grass for the young hero begins. We lived in Grass won numerous awards including the German short film Price.
"Ring of Fire" (2000) is the second part of The Country Trilogy. It is set in a bright and shining bazaar of sexual desires. The film is describing an archaic Machomyth and the desire of two cowboys to break with this myth. "Ring of Fire" won countless awards including the Grand Price at the Ottawa Animation Festival.

In 1995, Hykade, along with [[Gil Alkabetz]] and [[Film Bilder]], were commissioned to do a series of network ID's and commercials for [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon UK]].

"The Runt" (2006) is Hykade's third and final part of The Country Trilogy. The once dead father of "We Lived in Grass" returns. "I give you the runt," he says. "But you take care of it and you kill it next year." With "The Runt", Hykade finished what he calls his early work.

At present, Hykade is working at his first feature-length film. During a live talk at the [[Bradford]] Animation Festival on 17 November 2006, he revealed that the film would revolve around the life of [[Jesus]]. Hykade did not reveal exactly how he would treat the project, but mentioned his admiration for the films ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.

Since 2008, Hykade has taught animation at [[Harvard University]].

== Trivia ==
Whilst creating "We Lived in Grass" (1995) at the Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg, he met Philip Hunt. Hunt was employed as the animator in residence working on the award-winning short, "Ah Pook is Here". Hunt enlisted the help of the entire Academy staff, all apart from Hykade who continued producing his graduation piece.

However, Hunt asserts that whilst Andreas escaped a role on the film, he was a motivational force in making AH POOK happen - if only for his good humour and support when the project was at its hardest. Hunt recently interviewed 'Hugi' on stage at the Bradford animation festival where a retrospective of Hykade's work was shown.

The '''Comenius programme''' is a [[European Union]] educational project. It concerns school-level education, and is part of the EU's [[Erasmus Plus|Erasmus + 2014-2020 Programme]]. It aims "to help young people and educational staff better understand the range of European cultures, languages and values".&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|title=Comenius: Europe in the Classroom|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-programme/doc84_en.htm|work=European Commission: Education and Training|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Its name derives from the 17th-century Czech educator [[John Amos Comenius]].

==Programs==
The program is focussed on several areas:&lt;ref name=EC /&gt; 
*The basic problems of learning motivation, and skills in learning how to learn; 
*The key skills of Language learning, greater literacy, science learning, learning to support entrepreneurship, and the development of creativity and innovation;
*Digital educational, both content and services; 
*Improving school management, of teaching, and teacher education; 
*Reducing socio-economic disadvantages and discouraging early school leaving; 
*Increasing participation in sports; 
*Educating groups of students with diverse abilities; 
*Development of early and pre-primary learning.

The goal of the program is to have participation of more than three million students and teachers in international activities, thus improving mobility of students and teachers in the EU.

'''Continuing education''' (similar to [[further education]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and Canada.

Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by [[non-traditional student]]s, non-degree career training, college remediation, workforce training, and formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLean|first=S.|date=2007|title=About us: Expressing the purpose of university continuing education in Canada|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.21225/D5CS3K|journal=Canadian Journal of University Continuing Education|volume=33|issue=2|pages=65–86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirby|first=D.|last2=Curran|first2=V.|last3=Hollett|first3=A.|date=2009|title=Non-formal adult learning programs at Canadian post-secondary institutions: Trends, issues, and practices|url=https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/cjuce-rcepu/index.php/cjuce-rcepu/article/viewFile/8522/6881|journal=Canadian Journal of University Continuing Education|volume=35|issue=2|pages=63–86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General continuing education is similar to [[adult education]], at least in being intended for adult learners, especially those beyond traditional [[undergraduate]] [[college]] or [[university]] age.

Frequently, in the United States and Canada continuing education courses are delivered through a division or school of continuing education of a college or university known sometimes as the '''university extension''' or '''extension school'''. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] argued, however, that continuing education should be "'fully integrated into institutional life rather than being often regarded as a separate and distinctive operation employing different staff' if it is to feed into mainstream programmes and be given the due recognition deserved by this type of provision".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Perspectives on Higher Education and Lifelong Learners|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-67507-9|editor-last=Schütze|editor-first=Hans G.|location=NY, New York|pages=75|editor-last2=Slowley|editor-first2=Maria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georgetown University]], [[Michigan State University]], and the [[University of Denver]] have benefited from non-credit programs as it relates to strengthening partnerships with corporations and government agencies, helping to inform and shape the curriculum for degree programs, and generating revenue to support the academic enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Millard, E. (2014). {https://www.universitybusiness.com/article/extra-credit-non-credit "Extra credit for non-credit"}, {{University Business}}. Retrieved 2017-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Chautauqua Institution]], originally the Chautauqua Lake Sunday School Assembly, was founded in 1874 "as an educational experiment in out-of-school, vacation learning. It was successful and broadened almost immediately beyond courses for Sunday school teachers to include academic subjects, music, art and physical education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ciweb.org/about-us/about-chautauqua/our-history | title=Our History | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109035909/http://ciweb.org/about-us/about-chautauqua/our-history | archivedate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornell University]] was among higher education institutions that began offering university-based continuing education, primarily to teachers, through extension courses in the 1870s. As noted in the ''Cornell Era'' of February 16, 1877, the university offered a "Tour of the Great Lakes" program for "teachers and others" under the direction of Professor [[Theodore B. Comstock]], head of Cornell's department of geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornell Era 1875-1876, February 16, 1877, p.131|url=https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/22175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] began its continuing education program in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1976 the [[University of Florida]] created its own [[University of Florida Division of Continuing Education|Division of Continuing Education]] and most courses were offered on evenings or weekends to accommodate the schedules of working students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dce.ufl.edu/ UF Division of Continuing Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==For professionals==
{{Main|Professional development}}

Within the domain of continuing education, professional continuing education is a specific learning activity generally characterized by the issuance of a certificate or [[continuing education unit]]s (CEU) for the purpose of documenting attendance at a designated seminar or course of instruction.  [[Licensure|Licensing]] bodies in a number of fields (such as teaching and healthcare) impose continuing education requirements on members who hold licenses to continue practicing a particular profession. These requirements are intended to encourage professionals to expand their foundations of knowledge and stay up-to-date on new developments.

Depending on the field, these requirements may be satisfied through college or university coursework, extension courses or conferences and seminars attendance.  Although individual professions may have different standards, the most widely accepted standard, developed by the International Association for Continuing Education &amp; Training, is that ten contact hours equals one Continuing Education Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iacet.org/content/continuing-education-units.html|title=The IACET Standard: Continuing Education Units (CEUs)|publisher=International Association for Continuing Education and Training|accessdate=2008-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017205043/http://www.iacet.org/content/continuing-education-units.html|archivedate=2008-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all professionals use the CEU convention. For example, the American Psychological Association accredits sponsors of continuing education and uses simply a CE approach. In contrast to the CEU, the CE credit is typically one CE credit for each hour of contact.

In the spring of 2009, [[Eduventures]], a higher education consulting firm, released the results of a study that illustrated that the recession had made a significant impact on the views of prospective continuing education students. A survey of 1,500 adults who planned to enroll in a course or program within the next two years determined that while nearly half of respondents believed that the value of education had risen due to the recession, over two-thirds said the state of the economy had affected their plans to pursue continuing education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Recession-Has-Changed-Views/47151].The Chronicle of Higher Education, April 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work &lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; explains that flexible learning opportunities at universities and adult learning programs that allow workers to retrain and retool are vital in order for labor markets to adjust to the future of work.

==Method and format==
The method of delivery of continuing education can include traditional types of classroom lectures and laboratories.  However, many continuing education programs make heavy use of [[distance education]], which not only includes independent study, but can also include [[videotape]]d material, [[broadcasting|broadcast programming]] or [[online education]] which has more recently dominated the distance learning community.

Each different game focuses on a particular major learning category with selectable skill settings for preschooler, kindergarten and elementary learners. '''''Millie's Math House''''' (1992) on mathematics, '''''Bailey's Book House''''' (1993) on language, '''''Sammy's Science House''''' (1994) on science, and '''''Trudy's Time and Place House''''' (1995) on history and geography. A spin-off, '''''Stanley's Sticker Stories''''' (1996), sees players create animated storybooks with the series' characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.synapse-ada.com/edmark/prod/house/stanley/|title=Stanley - Overview|website=www.synapse-ada.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Millie &amp; Bailey Preschool''''' and '''''Millie &amp; Bailey Kindergarten''''' each contain the combined activities from two of the four software products. In addition the programs can be configured by an adult mode to suit students with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helsinki.fi/~reunamo/apu/kidsmart/Teachers_Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the activities in every game have two modes, one to allow learners to explore and try it out for themselves and the other for learners to follow specific tasks set by the game characters. Learners also have the option to print pictures of creative activities and record sounds in phonics activities. Later the games were re-developed by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Learning Technology]] and re-published by [[The Learning Company]] with newer graphics and additional activities.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The [[The New York Times|New York Times]] deemed ''Edmark'' an "impressive series", adding that "all four programs are a lot of fun".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/12/garden/childrens-s-software-for-navigating-tropics-alphabet-programs-that-go-through.html|title=Childrens's Software for Navigating Tropics and Alphabet;Programs that go through an entire grade|last=Mills|first=Joshua|date=1995-10-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer from SuperKids said '''''Millie's Math House''''' was an "excellent introductory math program for pre-schoolers" that was both educational and fun, while adding that the sound and graphics were adequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.superkids.com/aweb/pages/reviews/early1/millies/merge.shtml|title=SuperKids Software Review of Millie's Math House.|website=www.superkids.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer from TechWithKids thought the title was "well thought out" and offered a "supportive" environment within which the player could learn, noting that it was suitable for both the classroom and home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techwithkids.com/Review_SR00058S_millies-math-house|title=Millie's Math House Review - TechWithKids.com|website=www.techwithkids.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education International''' (EI) is a [[global union federation]] (GUF) of [[teacher]]s' [[trade union]]s consisting of 401 member organizations in 172 countries and territories that represents over 30 million education personnel from pre-school through [[university]]. This makes it the world's largest sectoral global union federation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

== Introduction ==
Education International is the voice of teachers and other education employees around the globe. It promotes the principle that quality education, funded publicly, should be available to every student in every country regardless of race. Education International advocates for equity in society by working to combat xenophobia and racism, and challenging discrimination on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and racial or ethnic origin or characteristics. In addition, Education International assists the development of independent democratic organizations to represent teachers and other education employees that represent and promote the interests of teachers and other education employees on the international level. The organization also works with other global federations of unions to promote and achieve solidarity in education.

==History==
Prior to the 1950s, teacher and other education unions played little role in international trade union federations. In 1912, the [[International Committee of National Federations of Teachers in Public Secondary Schools]] was established in [[Belgium]]. Internationally, it was known as FIPESO, an acronym derived from its French name: The Federation Internationale des Professeurs de l'Enseignement Secondaire Officiel. In 1923, the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) founded the [[World Federation of Education Associations]] (WFEA) in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Then in 1926, the [[International Federation of Teachers' Associations]] (IFTA) was formed.  The same year, the [[International Trade Secretariat of Teachers]] (ITST), a grouping of teachers' unions affiliated with the [[International Federation of Trade Unions]] (IFTU), was established. But few of these organizations obtained membership of any size, joined the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), or proved influential. Many were international in name only, with membership usually coming from a few European nations.  Except for the WFEA (which was dominated by the NEA), most ceased to function during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Towsley"&gt;Towsley, &lt;nowiki&gt;''The Story of the UNESCO/ILO 1966 Recommendation Concerning the Status of Teachers,''&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant reorganization of the international trade union movement occurred in the wake of the second world war. The [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] (WFTU) was founded in October 1945 to bring together trade unions across the world in a single international organization. But a number of conservative Western labor federations, notably the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), felt that trade unions from [[Communism|Communist]] countries were government-dominated. Their inclusion, it was feared, would lead to domination of the WFTU by the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1949, the AFL and other trade unions formed the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU), an international organization which rejected communist or communist-led trade unions.

International education trade centers also underwent a reorganization. The WFEA broadened its membership and was renamed the [[World Organization of the Teaching Profession]] (WOTP) in 1946. The same year, the ITST affiliated with the WFTU. But the split over communism in the WFTU affected the international education secretariats as well. In 1948, several socialist and communist teachers' unions formed the [[World Federation of Teachers Unions]] (known as FISE from its French title, Fédération Internationale Syndicale de l'Enseignement) in [[Budapest]]. Most non-communist national teachers' unions refused to join FISE. IFTA, FIPESO and FISE formed a liaison group, the Joint Committee of International Teachers' Federations, the same year. But the American-dominated WOTP refused to join. In 1951, following the split in the WFTU and the creation of the anti-communist ICFTU, two new international education secretariats were created.  WOTP, FIPESO and the IFTA formed the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP). The AFL (primary backer of the ICFTU) and its teacher union (the [[American Federation of Teachers]]) pushed the ICFTU to form its own international secretariat to compete with the much more liberal WCOTP.  The conservative and determinedly anti-communist [[International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions]] (IFFTU) was created the same year as the WCOTP. FISE, meanwhile, affiliated with the WFTU.&lt;ref name="Towsley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Docherty"&gt;Docherty, ''Historical Dictionary of Organized Labor,'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;Guthrie, ''Encyclopedia of Education,'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IFFTU remained the much smaller organization until the mid-1970s.  Although both the WCOTP and IFFTU gained members through the next 25 years, by 1976 the IFFTU represented unions with only 2.3 million members while the WCOTP represented unions with more than 20 million members.&lt;ref&gt;''Quadrennial Reports...:  Addendum,'' Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations, United Nations, March 20–31, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The WCOTP worked closely with the [[United Nations]], [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] and the ILO to study the problems of teachers throughout the world, and focused much of its attention on Africa and Asia.  For the first 15 years of its existence, the WCOTP worked heavily on a draft UNESCO instrument which would create a consensus on the status, salaries, and protections teachers should have. The final document, "Recommendation Concerning the Status of Teachers," was adopted by UNESCO on October 5, 1966.&lt;ref name="Towsley" /&gt;

The IFFTU and WCOTP remained strong rivals, each organization's policies and actions often reflecting the rivalry between the NEA and AFT (which were their respective secretariat's largest members).  But the surge in growth in AFT membership in the 1960s and 1970s significantly improved the membership figures of the IFFTU. A turn away from radical political views by a number of European, African and Asian education unions led a number of national organizations to disaffiliate from the WCOTP and join the IFFTU.&lt;ref name="Towsley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Docherty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rütters, "International Trade Secretariats – Origins, Development, Activities," ''International Trade Union Organisations,'' no date.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 1993, the WCOTP and IFFTU merged at a convention in [[Stockholm]] to form Education International. The stronger membership of the IFFTU at WCOTP expense led both organizations to see merger as a resolution to continuing conflict and competition, and merger was strongly advocated by AFT president [[Albert Shanker]]. The collapse of [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]] communist also helped to remove lingering political differences between the two groups (as well as the reason for the IFFTU's existence). Merger was first proposed in 1985, talks became serious in 1988, and merger achieved five years later. Shanker was elected EI's founding president.&lt;ref&gt;"Albert Shanker, 1928-1997," ''American Teacher,'' April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osava"&gt;Osava, "Teachers of the World - United and Underpaid," ''Inter Press Service,'' July 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Education International is a democratic organization which is governed by a World Congress.  Any national organization composed predominantly of teachers and/or education employees may belong.&lt;ref&gt;Education International Constitution, Article 4, "Membership." Article 5 stipulates that a "Committee of Experts" appointed by the EI Executive Board may examine prospective members to ensure the applicant meets the conditions of membership established in Article 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Each member is entitled to at least one delegate (up to a maximum of 50 delegates) for every 10,000 members or fraction thereof. Voting rights are more expansive than delegates, however.  Each member with up to 5,000 members receives one vote, but organizations with more than 5,000 members receive an additional vote for every 5,000 members. There is no cap on the number of votes a member organization may cast. For large organizations (such as those in the United States, Canada and Europe), this means each delegate may cast tens or even hundreds of votes.&lt;ref&gt;Education International Constitution, Article 5, f.&lt;/ref&gt; A World Congress composed of delegates meets every three years,&lt;ref&gt;Education International Constitution, Article 5, j.&lt;/ref&gt; at a place set by the Executive Board.&lt;ref&gt;Education International Constitution, Article 5, i.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Congress elects the President, Vice Presidents, General Secretary and members of the Executive Board; determines the policies and program of the organization; and adopts the budget and sets membership fees.&lt;ref&gt;Education International Constitution, Article 5, b.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Executive Board governs the organization between meetings of the World Congress. In addition to the President and five Vice-Presidents, the Executive Board has two additional Board members elected from each region, nine at-large members, and the General Secretary. At least one member from each region must be a woman.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Education International Constitution, Article 10, c.&lt;/ref&gt; The term of office for a Board member is three years (the time between World Congresses), and members are limited to two consecutive terms.&lt;ref&gt;Education International Constitution, Article 10, d.&lt;/ref&gt; The Board meets at least once a year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Education International Constitution, Article 10, i.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are seven officers of EI.  The President is the primary officer and spokesperson for the organization.  The General Secretary is the primary executive officer, and has day-to-day oversight of EI.  The EI constitution establishes five geographical regions,&lt;ref&gt;Education International Constitution, Article 13, a.&lt;/ref&gt; and each region is represented by a Vice-President. At least three of the six non-executive offices (e.g., President and Vice-Presidents) must be women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The officers and General Secretary must meet at least once a year, between Executive Board meetings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

EI's daily operations are overseen by a Secretariat. The Secretariat is run by a Deputy General Secretary appointed by the Executive Board in consultation with the General Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Education International Constitution, Article 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The EI Secretariat is located in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. The regional offices are located in the following:
*Africa: [[Accra]], [[Ghana]]
*Asia and the Pacific: [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Fiji]] – [[The Council of Pacific Education (COPE)]]
*Europe: [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]
*Latin America: [[San José, Costa Rica]]
*North America and the Caribbean: [[St. Lucia]].&lt;ref name="EE" /&gt;

The EI constitution also establishes largely autonomous regional structures to carry out work appropriate for each geographic region. Each regional body adopts its own constitution and by-laws (although these must be in accordance with the EI constitution), holds its own congresses and meetings, establishes dues and budgets, and carries out programs.&lt;ref&gt;Education International Constitution, Article 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

EI is affiliated with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] and enjoys formal associate relations with UNESCO, including the [[International Bureau of Education]] (IBE), and has consultative status with the [[UN Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).&lt;ref name="Osava" /&gt;

'''Education in [[Belgium]]''' is regulated and for the most part financed by one of the three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|communities]]: [[Flemish Community|Flemish]], [[French Community of Belgium|French]] and [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking]]. Each community has its own school system, with small differences among them. The federal government plays a very small role: it decides directly the age for mandatory schooling and indirectly the financing of the communities.

The schools can be divided in three groups ({{lang-nl|netten}}; {{lang-fr|réseaux}}):
# Schools owned by the communities (''GO! Onderwijs van de Vlaamse gemeenschap''; ''réseau de la Communauté française'')
# Subsidized public schools (''officieel gesubsidieerd onderwijs''; ''réseau officiel subventionné''), organized by provinces and municipalities
# Subsidized free schools (''vrij gesubsidieerd onderwijs''; ''réseau libre subventionné''), mainly organized by an organization affiliated to the [[Catholic]] church
The latter is the largest group, both in number of schools and in number of pupils.

Education in Belgium is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 18 or until one graduates from secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;(Dutch) [http://www.belgium.be/nl/Leren/onderwijs/rechten_en_plichten/leerplicht/ Leerplicht]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the past there were conflicts between state schools and [[Catholicism|Catholic]] schools, and disputes regarding whether the latter should be funded by the government (see [[First School War|first]] and [[second School War]]s). The 1958 School Pact was an agreement by the three large political parties to end these conflicts.

The 1981 [[State reform in Belgium|state reform]] transferred some matters from the federal Belgian level to the communities. In 1988, the majority of educational matters were transferred. Nowadays, very few general matters are regulated on a national level. The current ministries for education are the [[Flemish Government]], the [[Government of the French Community]] and the [[Government of the German-speaking Community]] for each community respectively. Brussels, being bilingual French-Dutch, has schools provided by both the Flemish and French-speaking community. [[Municipalities with language facilities]] often have schools provided by two communities (Dutch-French or German-French) as well.

==Stages of education==
The different stages of education are the same in all communities:
* Basic education ({{lang-nl|basisonderwijs}}; {{lang-fr|enseignement fondamental}}), consisting of
** [[Preschool education]] (''kleuteronderwijs''; ''enseignement maternel''): -6 years
** [[Primary school]] (''lager onderwijs''; ''enseignement primaire''): 6–12 years
* [[Secondary education]] (''secundair onderwijs''; ''enseignement secondaire''): 12–18 years
* [[Higher education]] (''hoger onderwijs''; ''enseignement supérieur'')
** [[University]] (''universiteit''; ''université'')
** [[Institute of technology#Belgium and the Netherlands|Polytechnic]]/[[Vocational university]] (''hogeschool''; ''haute école'')

==Pre-school==
Free pre-primary schooling ({{lang-nl|kleuterschool}}; {{lang-fr|enseignement maternel}}; {{lang-de|Kindergarten}}) is provided to every child from the age of 2 years 6 months. In most schools the child can start in school as soon as they reach this age, so class size for the youngest children grows during the year. In the [[Flemish region]], start dates are limited to 6 per year, after a school holiday period and the first school day in February.

The aim of pre-school is to develop, in a playful way, children's [[cognitive]] skills, their capacity to express themselves and communicate, their creativity and independence. There are no formal lessons or assessments, and everything is taught through a framework of play.

Although it is not compulsory, more than 90% of all children in the age category attend pre-school.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation | title = Structures of education, vocational training and adult education systems in Europe | url = http://www.eurydice.org/portal/page?_pageid=217,163540&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;pubid=047EN&amp;country=null&amp;countryreg=null | publisher = National Foundation for Educational Research | year = 2003 | format = &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AStructures+of+education%2C+vocational+training+and+adult+education+systems+in+Europe&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2003&amp;as_yhi=2003&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080119233416/http://www.eurydice.org/portal/page?_pageid=217,163540&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;pubid=047EN&amp;country=null&amp;countryreg=null | archivedate = January 19, 2008 | df =  }}  &lt;/ref&gt;

Most pre-schools are attached to a particular primary school.  Preschools and primary schools often share buildings and other facilities. Some schools offer special pre-primary education for children with disabilities or other special needs.

==Primary school==
[[File:École primaire de Viesville (DSCF7676).jpg|thumb|Primary school in [[Viesville]]]]
Primary school ({{lang-nl|lager onderwijs}}; {{lang-fr|enseignement primaire}}; {{lang-de|Grundschule}}) consists of six years and the subjects taught are generally the same at all schools. Primary schooling is free and age is the only entrance requirement.

Primary education is divided into three cycles ({{lang-nl|graden}}; {{lang-fr|degrés}}):
* First cycle (year 1 and 2)
* Second cycle (year 3 and 4)
* Third cycle (year 5 and 6)

Education in [[primary school]]s is rather [[Traditional education|traditional]]: it concentrates on reading, writing and basic mathematics, but also touches already a very broad range of topics (biology, music, religion, history, etc.). School usually starts about 8:30 and finishes around 15:30. A lunch time break is usually provided from 12:00 to 13:30. Wednesday afternoon, Saturday and Sunday are free. While morning lessons often concentrate on reading, writing and basic mathematics, lessons in the afternoon are usually about other topics like biology, music, religion, history or "[[do it yourself]]" activities.

Flemish schools in Brussels and some [[municipalities with language facilities|municipalities near the language border]], must offer French lessons starting from the first or the second year. Most other Flemish schools offer French education in the third cycle. Some of the latter schools offer non-mandatory French lessons already in the second cycle. Primary schools in the French Community must teach another language, which is generally Dutch or English, depending on the school. Primary schools in the German Community have obligatory French lessons.

There are also some private schools set up to serve various international communities in Belgium (e.g. children of seafarers or European diplomats), mainly around the larger cities. Some schools offer special primary education for children with disabilities or other special needs.

==Secondary education==
When graduating from primary school around the age of 12, students enter secondary education. Here they have to choose a course that they want to follow, depending on their skill level and interests.

Secondary education consists of three cycles ({{lang-nl|graden}}; {{lang-fr|degrés}}; {{lang-de|Grad}}):
* First cycle (year 1 and 2)
* Second cycle (year 3 and 4)
* Third cycle (year 5 and 6)
The Belgian secondary education grants the pupils more choice as they enter a higher cycle. The first cycle provides a broad general basis, with only a few options to choose from (such as Latin, additional mathematics and technology). This should enable students to orient themselves in the most suitable way towards the many different courses available in the second and third stages. The second and third cycle are much more specific in each of the possible directions. While the youngest pupils may choose at the most two or four hours per week, the oldest pupils have the opportunity to choose between different "menus": like Mathematics and Science, Economics and Languages or Latin and Greek. They are then able to shape the largest part of the time they spend at school. However, some core lessons are compulsory like the first language and sport, etc. This mix between compulsory and optional lessons grouped in menus, makes it possible to keep class structures even for the oldest students.

===Structure===
Secondary school is divided into four general types. Each type consists of a set of different directions that may vary from school to school. The general types are as follows:
* General Secondary Education ({{lang-nl|Algemeen Secundair Onderwijs}}; ASO; {{lang-fr|Enseignement Secondaire général}}): A very broad, general education, preparing for higher education. Once students have completed all six years, it is expected that they will continue studying (e.g.: university or college). Possible directions include (combinations of): ancient Greek and Latin, Modern Languages (stressing French and Dutch, English, German, and sometimes optional Spanish), Sciences (chemistry, physics, biology and geography), Mathematics, Economics, and Human Sciences (psychology, sociology, media).
* Technical Secondary Education ({{lang-nl|Technisch Secundair Onderwijs}}; TSO; {{lang-fr|Enseignement Secondaire technique}}): The TSO is divided into two groups of education again: TTK and STK. The TTK courses focus more on technical aspects, the STK courses focus more on practical matters. Both offer a general education in mathematics, languages, history, science, and geography, but mostly not on the same level as ASO courses. Lessons have a less theoretical, but more technical and practical approach. Once students have completed all six years they are either ready for the job market (STK courses mostly) or continue to study (TTK courses mostly). The continued studies could be a seventh specialization year (mostly STK students take this as an option), or studying for a bachelor's or master's degree. Possible directions include several office management-like directions, practical ICT, tourism, health, teaching, trade, practical engineering or communications.
* Vocational Secondary Education ({{lang-nl|Beroepssecundair Onderwijs}}; BSO; {{lang-fr|Enseignement Secondaire professionnel}}): Very practical and very job specific education. Afterwards, several directions offer seventh, sometimes eighth, specialisation years. Possible directions include carpentry, car mechanics, jewellery or masonry. BSO is the only type of secondary education that does not qualify students to pursue higher education. If the student chooses to follow the optional 7th (and sometimes 8th) year, they will receive a diploma of the same level as a TSO diploma, which does allow them to pursue higher education.
* Art Secondary Education ({{lang-nl|Kunstsecundair onderwijs}}; KSO; {{lang-fr|Enseignement Secondaire artistique}}): These schools link general and broad secondary education development with active art practice, ranging from performance arts to visual arts. Depending on the direction, several subjects might be purely theoretical, preparing for higher education. Directions include dancing (Ballet school), acting, and several graphical and musical arts. Many students graduating from these schools go to music conservatories, higher ballet or acting schools or art colleges to further develop their art.

Students with disabilities can follow Special Secondary Education ({{lang-nl|Buitengewoon Secundair Onderwijs}}; BuSO; {{lang-fr|Enseignement Secondaire spécial}}), of different types.

==Higher education==
{{See also|List of universities in Belgium}}Higher education in Belgium is organized by the two main communities, the [[Flemish Community]] and the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]]. [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German speakers]] typically enroll in institutions in the French Community or in [[Germany]].

=== Types of institutions of higher education ===
Flanders' higher education in separated between Universities (5 universities, ''universiteiten'') and University Colleges (''hogescholen''). The French Community organises higher education in Universities (6 universities), but makes a difference between the two types of schools that make up University Colleges : ''Hautes écoles'' and ''Écoles supérieures des Arts'' (a limited number of artistic institutions allowed to process selection of incoming students).

===Admission to universities and colleges===
In Belgium anybody with a qualifying diploma of secondary education is free to enroll at any institute of higher education of their choosing. The 4 major exceptions to this rule are those wanting to pursue a degree in:
; [[Medicine]]/[[Dentistry]] : prospective medicine or dentistry students must take an entrance exam organized by the government. This exam was introduced in the 1990s for the [[Flemish Community]] and in 2017 for the [[French Community of Belgium]] (where citizens of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking community]] can take their test in German), to control the influx of students. The exam assesses the student's knowledge of science, their ability to think in abstract terms (IQ test) and their psychological aptitude to become a physician.
; [[Arts]] : entrance exams to arts programs, which are mainly of a practical nature, are organized by the colleges individually.
; Engineering Sciences: leading to the degree of [[Master of Science]], these faculties had a long-standing tradition of requiring an entrance exam (mainly focused on [[mathematics]]); the exam has now been abolished in the [[Flemish Community]] but is still organized in the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]].
; Management Sciences: Leading to a master's after master's degree (Flanders), specialisation master's degree (French Community) or a [[Master of Business Administration|Master in Business Administration]] degree, these management schools organise admission tests that focus on individual motivation and pre-knowledge of a specialised domain. E.g. A Master in Financial Management programme requires prior knowledge on corporate finance and management control topics.

===Cost of higher education===

The registration fee for any university or college is fixed by the government of the French-speaking or the Dutch-speaking community, and indexed yearly. Depending on whether the student is eligible and applies for financial aid, there are 3 prices:
; Bursary-student : A student who is receiving financial aid. In French-speaking institutions, their tuition is free; in Dutch-speaking institutions, their tuition fee is between €80 and €100.
; Almost-bursary student : A student who is not eligible for financial aid but has a family income below €1286.09 per month. In Dutch-speaking institutions, their tuition fee is between €333.60 and €378.60.&lt;ref name="ond.vlaanderen"&gt;http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/werken/studentadmin/mededeling-gegevensbeheer/md20090325studiegeld0910.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and in French-speaking instutions, the fee must not exceed half of the full tuition fee.

; Non-bursary student : Anyone not eligible for financial aid with an income above €1286.09 per month. In Dutch-speaking institutions their tuition fee is between €890,00 and €910,00.&lt;ref name="ond.vlaanderen" /&gt; and in French-speaking institutions, around €830.

The financial aid awarded by the community governments depends on the income of the student's family, and other familial circumstances, but is never more than approximately €5,000 per year. The aid is not at all based on the student's results, however, students who fail too many classes can lose their financial aid.

===Bologna changes===
Prior to the adoption of the [[Bologna process]], the Belgian higher education system had the following degrees:

* Graduate degree (Dutch: ''gegradueerde'', French: ''gradué''): typically a 3-year-long programme at a college, with a [[vocational]] character, also called ''short type'' or ''one cycle'' higher education.
* Candidate degree (Dutch: ''kandidaat'', French: ''candidat''): the first 2 years at a University (3 years for medicine studies) or at some colleges offering ''long type'' or ''two cycle'' programs. This diploma had no finality than to give access to the licentiate studies.
* Licentiate diploma (Dutch: ''licentiaat'', French: ''licencié''): The second cycle, leading to a degree after typically 2 years (3 years for civil engineers or lawyers, 4 years for medicine).
* [[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]] (French:''diplôme d'études approfondies'') this is a 2 years postgraduate degree exists in the French speaker universities, the admission to this degree requires a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]]. the [[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]] is equivalent to the [[Master's degree]] in the American-English systems. [Note: The latter description is inaccurate. A DEA is a French (France) diploma and is not a recognized Belgian diploma. A Licentiate degree is customarily considered to be the equivalent of the French (France) ''maîtrise''. Pre-Bologna Licenciate diplomas are also considered to be a close equivalent to an American-English master's degree: they require 2 to 3 years of advanced coursework in the study area and  they may require the production of a final, substantial written thesis based on original research in the area of study (Dutch: ''eindscriptie'', French:''mémoire de licence'')].

A University education was not considered finished until the licentiate diploma is obtained. Occasionally it was possible to switch specializations after obtaining the candidate diploma. For example, a student with a mathematics candidate diploma was often allowed to start in the third year of computer science class. Sometimes a graduate diploma was also accepted as an equivalent to a candidate diploma (with additional courses if necessary), allowing for 2 or 3 more years of education at a University.

Since the adoption of the [[Bologna process]] in most European countries, the higher education system in Belgium follows the Bachelor/Master system:

; [[Bachelor's degree]]&lt;nowiki&gt; (French: &lt;/nowiki&gt;''bachelier''&lt;nowiki&gt;; Dutch: &lt;/nowiki&gt;''bachelor''):delivered after 3 years (180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) of Bachelor's studies (French: ''baccalauréat''; Dutch: ''bacheloropleiding''). Distinction is to be made between:
:* the ''professional bachelor'', (French: ''bachelier professionnel'' delivered after a ''formation de type court''; Dutch: ''professionele bachelor'') issued only by University Colleges, which replaces the former graduate degree and which has a finality.
:* the ''academic bachelor, (French: bachelier académique; Dutch: academische bachelor)'' issued by Universities and some University Colleges, which replaces the candidate degree and gives access to Master's studies.
:* So-called ''Banaba'' (Flemish Community) or ''Bachelier de spécialisation'' (French Community), specialisation degrees offered after a professional bachelor's degree.
; [[Master's degree]] : delivered after 1 or 2 years (60 or 120 ECTS) of Master's studies. ''Manama''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s (Flemish Community) or ''Masters de spécialisation'' (French Community) exist in Universities and are specialisation degrees offered after a Master's degree.

After obtaining a Master's degree, talented students can pursue research projects leading to a [[PhD|doctorate degree]]. PhDs are only awarded by Universities, but theses can be written at University Colleges or Art Schools, in collaboration with and published by a University.

== Quality ==
In the 2003 [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA-study]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=Learning for Tomorrows World – First Results from PISA 2003| url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/1/60/34002216.pdf| publisher = [[OECD]]| year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of secondary school students by the [[OECD]], the Belgian students scored relatively highly. The results of the [[Flemish Community|Dutch-speaking]] students were significantly higher than the scores of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking]] students which were in turn significantly higher than the [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking]] students&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=Learning for Tomorrows World – First Results from PISA 2003| url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/60/36324368.pdf| publisher = Universiteit Gent| year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The United Nations [[Education Index]], which is measured by the adult literacy rate and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrolment ratio, ranks Belgium on the 18th place in the world as of 2011. A 2007 study found that [[school violence|violence]] experienced by teachers in francophone Belgium was a significant factor in decisions to leave the teaching profession&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1348/000709906X114571 | last1 = Galand | first1 = B. | last2 = Lecocq | first2 = C. | last3 = Philipott | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = School violence and teacher professional disengagement | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=18781276 | journal = British Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 77 | issue = Pt 2| pages = 465–477 | pmid = 17504557 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Badrul Khan]]'s '''eight-dimensional e-learning framework''' is a detailed self-assessment instrument for institutions to organize their evaluation of [[educational technology]]  (e-learning) readiness and opportunities for growth. The framework provides a structure for systematically reviewing initiatives and programs, so that desired learning outcomes are achieved. The framework is composed of eight dimensions, each reviewed by practical checklists of 50 - 70 questions. The checklist does not include a scoring system, but serves as an instrument that verifies that each area is cultivated.

== Background ==
Public and private educational institutions, corporations and government agencies have been transferring their courses and professional development training from traditional, on site instruction to [[World Wide Web|web]]-based instruction. The programs are systematically assessed by frameworks that guide design, development and implementation of online programs.

Several successful [[educational technology]] (e-learning) frameworks have been developed, including:

* [http://elearning.tki.org.nz/Professional-learning/e-Learning-Planning-Framework2 e-Learning Planning Framework] 
* [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/jtap/htm/jtap-041.html Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) Framework] 
* [http://www.niace.org.uk/sites/default/files/project-docs/ACL-eLPS%20(1).doc ACL e-Learning Positioning Statement]

* [http://insight.eun.org/ww/en/pub/insight/thematic_dossiers/articles/quality_criteria/equality1.htm The Common Framework for E-Learning Quality]
* [http://asianvu.com/bk/framework/ Eight Dimensional E-Learning Framework]

Aligning organizational training goals and plans towards a design framework can benefit the stakeholders (i.e., administrators, designers, developers, and users), as well as improve the overall success and effectiveness of the program. Existing educational technology  programs hoping to streamline, modernize, or reform current practices and systems can utilize one of the aforementioned frameworks to ensure success.

== Overview ==

[[File:E-learning, blended learning framework and model.png#file|thumb|right|Khan's e-learning framework]]
Khan's framework was developed as a response to questions from readers requesting to see exemplars of effective Web-based instruction as defined in ''Web-Based Instruction'' (1997). The framework does not constitute a model because it does not prescribe a specific process for developing [[educational technology]]  environments. However, it does take into consideration the design, development, delivery, and evaluation of [[Web-Based_Instruction#Web-Based_Training_and_Online_Distance_Learning|web-based]] and [[Hybrid Course|hybrid]] instruction and can provide guidance in:&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;Khan, B. H. (n.d.). Elearning framework dimensions and subdimensions. Retrieved from http://asianvu.com/bookstoread/framework/elearning_framework_flyer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* organizing resources for educational technology, blended, and simulated [[Virtual learning environment|virtual-learning environments]]
* designing [[distributed learning]] systems for corporations, public and private universities, [[Virtual Universities|virtual universities]] and [[Virtual schools|cyber schools]]

* evaluating educational technology, [[blended-learning]] courses, and programs
* evaluating educational technology authoring tools/systems, [[Learning management system|LMS]] and [[Learning management system|LCMS]]

== Dimensions ==
The framework consists of eight dimensions, sometimes referred to as factors. Each dimension represents a category of issues that need to be considered in order to create successful experiences.  The framework offers a practical and detailed checklist to serve as a self-assessment instrument for institutions to evaluate their educational technology readiness or their opportunities for growth.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, B. H. (2005). Managing e-learning: Design, delivery, implementation, and evaluation. Information Science Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pedagogical ===

The [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] dimension addresses issues such as [[content analysis]], [[audience analysis]], goal analysis, [[design]], and methods and strategies&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; which assess the principles and methods of instruction (i.e., teaching and learning). It addresses how the content of a course is designed; identifies the learner's needs; and how the learning objectives will be achieved. This dimension also addresses the delivery method for the course activities and the appropriateness of the online environment for achieving the learning goals of its intended audience. When strictly face-to-face or online approaches are not feasible, the pedagogical dimension addresses the issues that enable stakeholders to prescribe alternatives, including a [[blended learning]] approach that combines elements of on-site and online instruction.

=== Technological ===

The [[technological]] dimension assesses the hardware, software, and [[infrastructure]] planning.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; It also addresses issues pertaining to the selection of the most suitable [[learning management system]] (LMS) and communication tools (i.e., audio and video conferencing platforms) for achieving the institution's learning goals and objectives. Technical requirements such as the server capacities, [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], security, backups, and other infrastructure issues are also addressed.

=== Interface ===

The [[interface design]] dimension addresses issues five sub-dimensions that pertain to the overall look and feel of an educational technology course or program: [[web design]], content design, navigation, [[accessibility]], and [[usability testing]].&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; For online learners the [[user interface]] is the first thing they see when they login to a course. The first impression students get from a course or program is often based on the site's user interface appearance and ease of use.

=== Evaluation ===

The [[evaluation]] dimension addresses the assessment of learners; evaluation of the instruction and learning environment;  assessment of content development processes and of the persons involved in the design process (i.e., the planning team, design team, production team, and evaluation team); review of [[instructional design]]  processes (i.e., planning, design, development and evaluation); and evaluation of e-learning at the program and institutional levels.

=== Management ===

The [[management]] dimension addresses the continuation, updating, and upkeep of the learning environment.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; This continuation may be used to determine whether the educational technology atmosphere is performing adequately, and whether the instruction is meeting its intent. This dimension also addresses issues of [[quality control]], budgeting, staffing, security, and scheduling.

=== Resource support ===

The [[resource]] support dimension considers all of the technical and [[human resources]] support required to create meaningful and successful online learning environments. Examples of the support services include web-based and telephone [[technical support]], [[digital libraries]], [[online tutorials]], newsletters, journals, [[podcasts]], glossaries, [[FAQs]], and career counseling services.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt;

=== Ethical ===

The [[ethical]] dimension addresses issues pertaining to social and political influence, [[Cultural diversity|diversity]], [[bias]], the [[digital divide]], information accessibility, [[etiquette]], and legal issues.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; Legal issues include privacy, [[plagiarism]] and [[copyright]] issues.

=== Institutional ===

The [[institutional]] dimension addresses three sub-dimensions: issues of administrative affairs, academic affairs and student services related to educational technology.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; Administrative affairs issues relate to admissions, financial aid, registration and payment, informational technology services, graduation, and grades. Academic Affairs refers to [[accreditation]], policy, instructional quality, faculty and support staff, and class size. Student services is a wide field that covers everything from counseling and library support to book store, internships, and alumni affairs. Before a fully online program is launched, each of the aforementioned issues must be addressed for a smooth implementation. Online students should not be required to set foot on campus to participate in or take advantage of student services.

'''Eye Level Learning''', formerly known as '''E.nopi''', offers supplementary educational programs from [[Daekyo]]. The name "Eye Level Learning" is used internationally whilst in [[South Korea]], where [[Daekyo]] is headquartered, it is named "Noonnoppi" ({{korean|hangul=눈높이}}) meaning "eye level".

Established in 1976, Daekyo provides a systematic learning method developed by Dr. Young Joong Kang. The program consists of Eye Level Math, which includes Basic and Critical Thinking Math, Eye Level English which includes four main concepts (reading, writing, speaking, and listening) and Eye Level Korean.

Eye Level has centers and student enrollment throughout North America and Asia. More than 2.5 million children in 25 countries have benefited from the Eye Level program. Eye Level Learning centers are located around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myeyelevel.com/Global/English/ List of all Eye Level Learning franchises by country]. Find a learning center&lt;/ref&gt; Eye Level Franchise provides its franchisees with thorough training and comprehensive ongoing support.

==Academics==
===Mathematics===
Eye Level Math has two main sections: Basic Thinking Math and Critical Thinking Math. In Basic Thinking Math, students focus on the arithmetic part of mathematics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). In Critical Thinking Math, students focus on patterns and relationships, geometry, problem solving, measurement and reasoning. Students are assigned to their levels based on test results, not by their grade levels.  The "eye level" name means to look at the problem from the children's level.  A teacher should get down to the child's level and see the problem to better assist them in solving it. 

===English===
Eye Level English focuses on four main fundamental skills: Reading, Listening, Writing, and Speaking. Within the program, students have the ability to reinforce their English skills with such activities as Active Listening, writing prompts, and phonics.

===Chinese===
Eye Level Chinese (Only in [[China]]) is reviewed by Beijing University. It focuses on listening, speaking, reading and writing. They learn about Chinese characters by role-playing, songs, games and other engaging activities.

===Supplemental Education Services===
Eye Level works through the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. Eye Level offers tutoring known as [[Supplemental Education Services]]. Eye Level is an approved provider in the following U.S. states: California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2013/05/01/eye-level-learning-center-franchises.html|title=Eye Level learning center franchise making big push into region|date=May 1, 2013|publisher=bizjournals.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecticut, Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/morton-grove/news/ct-mgc-eye-level-literacy-awards-tl-0827-20150817-story.html|title=Morton Grove's Eye Level Learning participates in annual literary competition|date=August 17, 2015|publisher=chicagotribune.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mebs.gmnews.com/node/78855|title=gmnews.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/nyregion/cram-schools-no-longer-just-an-asian-pursuit.html?_r=0&amp;referrer=|title=Centers See New Faces Seeking Test Prep|date=April 2, 2013|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania and Texas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1550">[[File:Krul.svg|thumb|Krul]]A '''flourish of approval''' or ''krul'' is a mostly Dutch [[symbol]] used for grading schoolwork or to show that one has seen and agreed with a paragraph. The ''krul'' first appeared in the early 19th century together with the rising bureaucracy in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waar komt het vandaan?|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2011/02/09/waar-komt-het-en-vandaan-het-11995186-a946165|website=NRC|language=Dutch|accessdate=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians believe that the symbol is derived from a hastily written 'g' which would stand for good (''goed'') or seen (''gezien''). The symbol is rarely used outside of the Netherlands apart from (former) Dutch colonies like [[Indonesia]], [[South Africa]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Suriname]].

Despite its wide usage throughout the country and its former colonies there is no unicode symbol for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to make a “krul” (unofficial Dutch symbol for OK)|url=https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/313281/how-to-make-a-krul-unofficial-dutch-symbol-for-ok|website=Stackexchange|language=English|accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the name or Unicode for this symbol (similar to ₰, Dutch, called Krul)|url=https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/58320/what-is-the-name-or-unicode-for-this-symbol-similar-to-₰-dutch-called-krul|website=Stackexchange|language=English|accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table''' ('''GLBTRT''') is part of the [[American Library Association]] and is dedicated to serving and meeting the information needs of [[LGBT]] individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/about/bylaws GLBTRT Bylaws &amp; Mission Statement | Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Round Table (GLBTRT)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Round Table also serves library professionals who are LGBT.  One of the core values of the ALA is to reflect the diversity of the United States by "providing a full spectrum of resources and services to the communities [they] serve."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/statementspols/corevalues#diversity Core Values of Librarianship | Advocacy, Legislation &amp; Issues&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GLBTRT provides an online toolkit for library professionals who want to promote or display LGBT materials. The toolkit also explains how to deal with complaints from the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/iftoolkits/glbttoolkit/glbttoolkit Out in the Library: Materials, Displays and Services for the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Community | Advocacy, Legislation &amp; Issues&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the GLBTRT was formed. It was originally called the Task Force on Gay Liberation, and it was formed within the American Library Association. It is the oldest LGBT professional organization in the United States. [[Barbara Gittings]] became its coordinator in 1971.

In the early 1970s, the GLBTRT (then called the Task Force on Gay Liberation) campaigned to have books about the gay liberation movement at the Library of Congress reclassified from HQ 71–471 ("Abnormal Sexual Relations, Including Sexual Crimes"). In 1972, after receiving a letter requesting the reclassification, the Library of Congress agreed to make the shift, reclassifying those books into a newly created category, HQ 76.5 ("Homosexuality, Lesbianism—Gay Liberation Movement, Homophile Movement").

In 1971 the GLBTRT created the first award for GLBT books, the [[Stonewall Book Award]], which celebrates books of exceptional merit that relate to LGBT issues.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/award Stonewall Book Awards | Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Round Table (GLBTRT)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822082408/http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/award |date=2015-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Patience and Sarah]]'' by [[Alma Routsong]] (pen name Isabel Miller) was the first winner.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 1992, American Libraries published a photo of the GLBTRT (then called the Gay and Lesbian Task Force) on the cover of its July/August issue, drawing both criticism and praise from the library world. Some commenters called the cover "in poor taste" and accused American Libraries of "glorifying homosexuality," while others were supportive of the move. Christine Williams, who wrote an essay about the controversy surrounding the cover, concluded that in the mid-90s, the library world was "not an especially welcoming place to gays and lesbians."

In 2010, the GLBTRT announced a new committee, the Over the Rainbow Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glbtrt.ala.org/overtherainbow/|title=Over the Rainbow Books|last=|first=|date=|website=Over the Rainbow Books|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This committee annually compiles a bibliography of books that show the GLBT community in a favorable light and reflects the interests of adults. The bibliographies provide guidance to libraries in the selection of positive GLBT materials.The bibliographies are split by age with the Rainbow Book List providing material for children and teens, and the Over the Rainbow Book List supplying titles for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.library.illinois.edu/ala/lots-love-revolutionary-non-revolutionary-kind-history-glbt-round-table/|title="Lots of Love (of both the revolutionary and non-revolutionary kind)": the History of the ALA’s GLBT Round Table|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ALA's Office for Diversity, Literacy, and Outreach Services and the GLBTRT assumed oversight of GBLT Book month which occurs annually in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=70642|title=Political Notebook: Library group takes lead in promoting LGBT books|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts to increase visibility of GLBT material included promoting the Rainbow Books and the Over the Rainbow Books lists, marketing on social media using a specific hashtag, and providing resources for libraries to participate in GLBT Book month.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6015">The '''Gifted Education Resource Institute (GERI)''' is a multidimensional center dedicated to the study, discovery, and development of human potential. It was founded by [[John F. Feldhusen]] in 1977 and is situated in the College of Education, [[Purdue University]] in West Lafayette, Indiana. GERI’s mission is holistic development of [[Gifted education|giftedness]], creativity, and talent among individuals throughout their lifespan. This is accomplished through enrichment programs for talented youth, graduate programs for future scholars and leaders, professional development and coursework for educators, and ongoing research on the psychology of giftedness, creativity, and talent development.
GERI faculty and staff work with [[K–12 (education)|P-12]]  educators in developing and improving services for gifted, creative, and talented children, as well as training school teachers and administrators in [[gifted education]]. In addition, GERI has developed several programs for talented youth. The Super Saturday program, a six-week enrichment program, was created in the spring of 1976. In 1977, GERI began Summer Residential Camps, aimed at providing a preview of college life to talented students. 

__TOC__

== Talent development programs ==

The talent development programs at GERI help talented students explore their areas of interest in a college atmosphere where they study topics typically not offered in school. Together, students learn challenging content and create meaningful projects in which they apply their learning in new and relevant ways. Participation in GERI programs provides students in-depth and clear understanding of the fields they might like to pursue.  Many students attend GERI Talent Development Programs for multiple years.

=== Summer residential camps ===

Every summer, for over 34 years, GERI has engaged gifted, creative, and talented students from across the country and around the world in residential camps designed to stimulate their imagination and expand their abilities.  Students who have completed grades 5 through 12 live in campus residence halls, take challenging courses, and participate in engaging recreational activities. 
GERI offers three programs each summer. 
* Comet, 1 week sessions:  For students who have completed grade 5-6.
* Star, 2 week sessions:  For students who have completed grades 7-8.
* Pulsar, 2 week sessions: For students who have completed grades 9-12.
The application process includes:
* Completing the application form.
* Creating a one-to two-page essay or alternative media (such as a Web site, PowerPoint presentation, or art portfolio) that addresses the applicant’s desire and motivation to participate.
* Submitting evidence of notable ability, achievement, or involvement in the areas of study as detailed in the program brochure.  Such evidence can include grades, test scores, letters of recommendation, and awards.

=== Super Summer and Super Saturday programs ===
The Super Summer and Super Saturday programs are two enrichment programs designed to meet the needs of academically, creatively, and artistically gifted students from Pre-Kindergarten (age 4) through grade 8. The courses include science, technology, engineering, mathematics, visual and performing arts, as well as original interdisciplinary studies.  Super Saturday is offered both fall and spring semesters for six Saturdays, and Super Summer is offered week days during the summer for two, one-week sessions. 
Research on these programs found that students had positive experiences, learned new, above-grade-level concepts, and participated in interactive learning.

== Graduate programs ==
=== Ph.D. and master's ===

The internationally recognized [[Ph.D.]] and master's degree programs in gifted, creative, and talented studies attract students from across the country and around the world. Working closely with faculty scholars as mentors, students prepare for productive leadership roles in research, teaching, and program development. Funding may be available to support exceptional students pursuing full-time Ph.D. study.

=== Licensure ===

The accredited [[licensure]] program is available online and on campus for teachers interested in adding a high-ability license to their Indiana teaching credentials or as a certificate in gifted, creative, and talented studies for educators in other states and countries. In this program, educators develop the knowledge and skills to meet the cognitive, affective, and social needs of gifted, creative and talented learners. They learn to how to develop and differentiate curriculum and instruction; and they prepare for leadership and teaching roles in working with and developing programs for gifted, creative, and talented students

== Research ==

The faculty and graduate students at GERI engage in cutting-edge research that informs and influences theory and practice. Some examples include: 
* Total School Cluster Grouping Model
* Purdue Three-Stage Model
* Theory of Personal Talent
* Developing talent in the [[STEM fields|STEM]] disciplines
* Applying gifted education know-how to improve general education
* Understanding social and affective needs
* Investigating students’ perceptions of their learning experiences
* Studying [[twice-exceptional]] learners
* Recognizing and developing talent among underserved populations and in non-traditional areas

== Professional development ==

Faculty and staff conduct professional development related to their research using online, on-site, and campus-based delivery methods, engaging educators from across the [[United States]] and from schools worldwide.

A Higher Certificate academic programme is two years of full-time study. Students can complete an additional (add-on) year to obtain the Ordinary Bachelors degree (level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications), and may then complete a further add-on year to obtain the Honours Bachelors degree (level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications). The Higher Certificate is, in effect, two years of a four year undergraduate degree. The Higher Certificate should not be confused with the Advanced Certificate which is a two year Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) program of further education, typically delivered by community colleges, and is also awarded at level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications and can be used to gain entry to a third level undergraduate program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7070">In English-language education, '''History of the English language''' ('''HEL''') is a commonly required class for students in [[English studies]] and [[Education theory|Education]], though in the nineteenth and early twentieth century it was often required of all US college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baugh|first=Albert C.|year=1962|title=Historical Linguistics and the Teacher of English|journal=[[College English]]|volume=24|issue=2|pages=106–10|jstor=373743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

Since HEL is often the only linguistics class required of English majors and Education students, it usually includes a basic introduction to linguistic concepts and theories (on phonetics, dialects, language families, etc.) as well as the historical stages of English--[[Old English]], [[Middle English]], [[Early Modern English]], and [[Modern English]].

Among the topics which may be taught in HEL are the following: origin and development of the language; vocabulary and etymology; meaning and expression; the role of reference books and dictionaries; varieties of spoken English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/details.php?id=Q100-38|title=History of the English Language|date=2002–2013|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and place in the curriculum==

The need for HEL, as perceived by college professors and (English) department heads, was found to vary widely in a poll of department heads done in 1952. The poll asked heads to comment on the selection of language courses they'd require an MA candidate who applies for a teaching position to have taken; of 46 heads, 20 marked HEL, more than any other option (including advanced grammar, Old English, Chaucer, etc.). The author of the study noted that at the time no graduate courses in language study were required for the MA programs at many notable institutions, including Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Ohio State, and Penn State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Donald W|year=1952|title=English Language Studies and the M. A. Program|journal=[[College English]]|volume=14|issue=3|pages=164–66|jstor=372130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occasional passionate plea is made to promote HEL—J. E. Graves notes in a 1956 article in ''[[College English]]'' that proper courses in HEL are necessary for any future English teacher, and bemoans the perceived shoving aside of "language study in high school with non-rigorous semantics and 'learning situations.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graves|first=J. E.|year=1956|title=Training English Teachers|journal=[[College English]]|volume=17|issue=8|jstor=495707}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such plea came in 1961 from [[Albert C. Baugh]], professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania and author of ''A History of the English Language'',&lt;ref name=kent&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=Ronald G.|year=1936|title=Rev. of Baugh, ''A History of the English Language''|journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=72–75|jstor=409029|doi=10.2307/409029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomfield&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloomfield|first=Morton C.|year=1958|title=Rev. of Baugh, ''A History of the English Language''|journal=[[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]|volume=57|issue=4|page=796|jstor=27707189}}&lt;/ref&gt; who "justified" HEL by arguing that it teaches skills necessary for teachers of literature who often have students read older texts (Baugh cites Shakespeare throughout), including etymology (and the history of word changes), pronunciation and accentuation, and grammar and idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baugh|first=Albert C.|year=1962|title=Historical Linguistics and the Teacher|journal=[[College English]]|volume=24|issue=2|pages=106–10|jstor=373743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many, though by no means all, scholars of education suggest the importance of HEL. Marcia Henry, taking the [[Orton-Gillingham]] approach for dyslexic children as a structural starting point, argues that teaching the subject aids students in decoding and spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=Marcia K.|year=1998|title=Beyond Phonics: Integrated Decoding and Spelling Instruction Based on Word Origin and Structure|journal=[[Annals of Dyslexia]]|volume=38|pages=258–75|url=http://ld4elementaryliteracy.edublogs.org/files/2008/07/beyondphonics.pdf|doi=10.1007/bf02648260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of English education, a field now often referred to as English Language Arts in which HEL is often required, the position of history of the English language is tenuous: it is not universally acknowledged that elementary and high-school students need to be taught anything about the subject. James Ney, a linguist at Arizona State University, argues that the shift in contemporary linguistics toward [[transformational grammar]] has taken attention away from historical linguistics. Ney's study of high-school textbooks suggested that history of English only takes up a minute amount of coverage; if it is there at all, it pertains to etymology and dictionary usage. Though some curriculum proposals (some of which very ambitious; Ney singles out the 1968 Atlanta Regional Curriculum Project) did promote a more rigorous study of the subject in elementary and high school, no discernible impact seems to have been made on actual school curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ney|first=James W.|editor=James Flood|others=Diane Lapp, James R. Squire, Julie M.

The '''Institute of Public Administration and Management''' ('''IPAM''') is an institute of the University of Sierra Leone. It operates like other constituent colleges of the [[University of Sierra Leone]], under the authority of the University Senate and the University Court. IPAM is in the centre of Freetown at AJ Momoh Street, Tower Hill, close to the British Council, Statistics Sierra Leone, the West African Examination Council (WAEC) and the National Fire Force headquarters. The institute has four departments offering a range of business, information technology, finance and public administration courses to the public.

==Establishment==

The establishment of IPAM can be traced to 1970. It came as a result of a government white paper on education which proposed the closure of the Civil Service Training College. The responsibility for the training of middle- and upper-level staff was transferred to [[Fourah Bay College]] and that of the clerical cadre to the Freetown Technical Institute.

Subsequent review by the World Bank suggested the need for a more specialised establishment in public administration and management. Discussions between the World Bank and the government of Sierra Leone resulted in the decision to establish the Institute of Public Administration and Management as an institute of the University of Sierra Leone.

Funds were made available under the Second IDA Education Project for construction of suitable accommodation for the institute. The building on the site of the then Civil Service Training College was occupied in June 1980 and the institute started work in the 1980/81 academic year.  

==Management==

The institute is managed by a dean of campus (formerly director) who reports directly to the vice-chancellor and principal of the University of Sierra Leone. A management team comprises the dean of campus, assistant dean of campus, deputy registrar and all heads of departments (administrative and academic).

==Functions==

The main functions of the institute include:

# Offering courses leading to the award of certificates, diplomas and degrees of the [[University of Sierra Leone]];
# Designing and organizing management training courses and programmes for personnel in the public and private sectors and NGOs;
# Organising conferences, workshops and seminars;
# General management, financial management and banking, human resource management, procurement and logistic, public policy, organisational effectiveness and capacity building, basic office skills, entrepreneurship, marketing management and information technology;
# Providing advisory and consultancy services on aspects of management, finance and administration;
# Carrying out studies, enquiries and research in its areas of competence either independently or in collaboration with interested parties; and
# Conducting tests and other evaluation exercises for both the public and private sector organisations.

'''International Association for Jazz Education (IAJE)''', formerly a [[not-for-profit]] corporation based in [[Manhattan, Kansas]], was a volunteer-run organization that, among other things, allocated student [[scholarship]]s through its approved festivals program.  Its annual conference was a gathering point for professional artists as well as [[jazz]] enthusiasts.  Many considered IAJE to be a foundation of the jazz community, and its many programs to be a cornerstone of [[jazz education]].&lt;ref name="GroveMusicOnline-IAJE-article" /&gt;

IAJE was first incorporated as a non-profit on August 18, 1989, having developed from the '''International Association of Jazz Educators''' (since 1971) and the U.S. National Association of Jazz Education (since 1968). The association organized more than 7,000 teachers, musicians, producers, and others interested in jazz, from more than thirty countries. They organized a yearly conference, which included numerous musical presentations.

IAJE filed for bankruptcy April 2008, and ceased as a corporation March 15, 2009.  The bankruptcy filing was necessitated, in part, because of financial problems stemming from a lack of donations, and losses &amp;ndash; notably from the small turnout at the Toronto conference of 2008.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|title=A Jazz Lifeline to Academia Is Severed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/26/arts/music/26jazz.html?ex=1209873600&amp;en=eb562ae3706118f9&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1|accessdate=30 June 2011|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karen Burns''' (born 1962) is an architectural historian and theorist based in [[Melbourne]], Australia.  She is currently a senior lecturer in architecture at the Melbourne School of Design, [[University of Melbourne]].

== Early years and education ==
Born in January 1962, Burns grew up in the Melbourne suburb of [[Beaumaris, Victoria|Beaumaris]]. Her feminist activism first found expression in 1978 when she worked as a volunteer at a newly established refuge for women and children escaping family violence.

Burns studied English literature and art history at [[Monash University]], the latter with [[Patrick McCaughey]] and Conrad Hamann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.architecture.com.au/docs/vic-citations/conrad_hamann_citation.pdf?sfvrsn=2|title = Citation For Honorary Fellow – Conrad Hamann|date = |accessdate = 11 October 2015|website = |publisher = Royal Australian Institute of Architects|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was Hamann’s first honours student. Burns graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (hons) in 1984 and a Master of Arts in 1987. She began studying architecture at [[RMIT University]] in 1986, and began editing the magazine ''Transition'' the same year. Her PhD, "Urban Tourism, 1851-53: sightseeing, representation and ''The Stones of Venice''" was completed in 1999 at the School of Fine Arts, Classical Studies and Archaeology, University of Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/36040|title = Urban tourism, 1851-53: sightseeing, representation and the Stones of Venice|date = 1999|accessdate = |website = Minerva access|publisher = University of Melbourne|last = Burns|first = Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Burns has held academic positions at a number of universities in Melbourne. She began her academic career at RMIT University (1986–1995) and then joined the [[University of Melbourne Faculty of Arts|Department of English and Cultural Studies]] and Department of Fine Arts, Classics and Archaeology, University of Melbourne (1997–1999, 2001). She spent three years at the Centre for Ideas, [[University of Melbourne Faculty of VCA and MCM|Victorian College of the Arts]] (2002–2004), of which she was Acting Director in 2002–2003. She joined the new Department of Architecture at [[Monash University]] in 2008 and was later appointed as a Senior Lecturer in Architecture at the Melbourne School of Design, University of Melbourne, a position she still holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lunchtime Art Forum - Dr Karen Burns (Monash University) Research in Architecture, Monash University|url = http://monash.edu/news/events/show/lunchtime-art-forum-dr-karen-burns-monash-university-research-in|website = monash.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DR KAREN BURNS - The University of Melbourne|url = http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person15488|website = www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Melbourne School of Design {{!}} University of Melbourne {{!}} Dr Karen Burns|url = https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/people/karen-burns|website = Melbourne School of Design|accessdate = 2015-10-11|first = Melbourne School of Design {{!}} University of|last = Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her academic research focuses on three principal areas: Australian frontier housing and problems of interpretation, late-twentieth-century feminist architectural history and theory, and alliances between architects, aesthetics and manufacturers in mid-nineteenth-century Britain. In relation to the last topic she is working on a book titled ''Object Lessons: Demonstrating Victorian Design Reform, 1835–1870.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DR KAREN BURNS - The University of Melbourne|url = http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person15488#tab-overview|website = www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns was an active researcher on the [[Australian Research Council]] funded project Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architectural Profession: women, work and leadership (2011-2014), which was led by [[Naomi Stead]] of the [[University of Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: Women, Work, and Leadership - UQ Researchers|url = http://researchers.uq.edu.au/research-project/12113|website = researchers.uq.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its key outcomes was [[Parlour: women, equity, architecture]]. Burns was instrumental in establishing this organisation with colleagues from the research project, and was responsible for coining the name Parlour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/about/research/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be understood in the context of her long engagement in feminist and social activism in architecture.

Burns' has given invited keynote presentations at three conferences: ''Fabulations,'' the Annual Conference of [[SAHANZ]], [[University of Tasmania]], July 2012; ''Interstices'', University of Tasmania, November 2011; Whirlwinds Symposium, ''Sexuate Subjects: Politics, Poetics and Ethics'', [[The Bartlett|Bartlett School of Architecture]], [[University College London]], December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Confirmed Invited Speakers|url = https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sexuate-subjects/keynotespeakers|website = www.ucl.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2011 Interstices Under Construction Symposium: Technics, Memory and the Architecture of History - Events|url = http://www.events.utas.edu.au/2011/november/2011-interstices-under-construction-symposium-technics,-memory-and-the-architecture-of-history|website = www.events.utas.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SAHANZ Conferences|url = http://www.sahanz.net/conferences/|website = www.sahanz.net|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Update: Technics, Memory and the Architecture of History|url = https://intersticesjournal.wordpress.com/2011/10/03/update-technics-memory-and-the-architecture-of-history/|website = Interstices: Journal of Architecture and Related Arts|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has presented her research work at many more conferences and symposia and is an active member of the academic community.

== Editorial work and architectural criticism ==
Burns has played important roles in a range of publications, both scholarly and professional, as editor, contributor and advisor.

=== ''Transition: Discourse on Architecture'' ===

She was editor of ''[[Transition: Discourse on Architecture]]'', an influential&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; quarterly journal published by RMIT University, from July 1986 – December 1991. This saw her edit 17 issues of the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transition (Collingwood, Vic.) - Details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/44725233|website = trove.nla.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1987, this was an editorial partnership with [[Harriet Edquist]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://sahanz2015.be.unsw.edu.au/papers/Sawyer_Call-and-Response.pdf|title = Call-and-Response: Group Formation and Agency enacted through an Architectural Magazine, its Letters and Editorials|last = Sawyer|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Architecture Institutions and Change, Proceedings of SAHANZ |volume=32|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |isbn = 978 0 646 94298 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Companion City {{!}} ACCA|url = https://www.accaonline.org.au/exhibition/companion-city|website = www.accaonline.org.au|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights of the journal over this period include:
* no. 25 (1988) ''Women &amp; Architecture'' 
* no. 26 (1988) ''The Bicentennial Issue'' 
* no. 27/28 (1989) ''New Urbanism'', which included a 25-page review of the New Parliament House by [[James Weirick]]. 
Transition was also a vehicle for exhibitions and competitions, including:
* 1991 ''Transition Companion City Competition''. The competition "explored the future for our cities through ideas of design, energy conservation, planning and the environment" and also resulted in exhibition at [[Australian Centre for Contemporary Art]] (ACCA) curated by Burns and Edquist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.accaonline.org.au/sites/default/files/1991_Transition%2C%20Companion%20City%20Forum%20review.pdf|title = Companion City Forum at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art|last = London|first = Geoffrey|date = 1995|journal = Transition: Discourse on Architecture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.accaonline.org.au/sites/default/files/1991_30%20March_The%20Age%2C%20A%20wild%20ride%20for%20planning%20theory.pdf|title = A Wild Ride for Planning Theory|last = Stephens|first = John|date = 30 March 1991|work = The Age|access-date = 11 October 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 1989 Transition 10th Anniversary Conference. This focussed on the topic ''[[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]]', the Architect as Critic'', and was accompanied by a tour of Boyd's houses and an exhibition (curated with [[Philip Goad]]) of Boyd's publications at the State Library of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Robin Boyd : the architect as critic : an exhibition at the La Trobe Library of Victoria, 1989 / [editors: Karen Burns, Harriet Edquist]. - Version details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/209616773|website = trove.nla.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference papers were published together with Boyd's catalgoue raisonnee in 1992.

=== ''Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Art'' ===

Burns edited four issues of this publication, which is the journal of the Art Association of Australia &amp; New Zealand between 2004 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = journal - AAANZ {{!}} The Art Association of Australia and New Zealand|url = http://aaanz.info/journals/|website = AAANZ {{!}} The Art Association of Australia and New Zealand|accessdate = 2015-10-11|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Editorial boards ===

Burns also sits on the editorial boards of a number of academic journals: ''Fabrications'' (journal of [[SAHANZ]]), ''[http://interstices.ac.nz/ Interstices]'', ''Ultima Thule'' and ''Architectural Theory Review.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FABRICATIONS latest issue|url = http://www.sahanz.net/publications/editors.html|website = www.sahanz.net|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been a contributing editor to ''Architecture Australia''.

=== Criticism ===

Architectural criticism by Burns has been published in a range of professional journals including [[Architecture Australia]], Architectural Review Australia, Monument and Landscape Architecture Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dr Karen Burns|url = http://architectureau.com/contributors/Burns-Dr-Karen/|website = ArchitectureAU|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism and public engagement ==
Burns has a long history of involvement with feminist activism and social justice issues in architecture. She is a founding member of the Melbourne-based organisation E1027: Women in Architecture (1990) – established with [[Harriet Edquist]] and others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = E1027: from Modernist House to Feminist Collective|last = Burns|first = Karen|publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-4438-4027-9|location = Cambridge|pages = |editor-last = Edquist|editor-first = Harriet|chapter = |work = The Design Collective: An Approach to Practice|editor-link = Harriet Edquist|editor-last2 = Vaughan|editor-first2 = Laurene}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 the organisation had 80 members, including  architects [[Maggie Edmond]], [[Anne Cunningham]], [[Ann Keddie]], Mary Ruth Sindrey, Val Austin, [[Suzanne Dance]], [[Eli Giannini]], Mardi Butcher, [[Jill Garner]] and Anna Ely. Members also included women artists such as Kathy Temin, Sarah Curtis, Lauren Berkowitz and Jan Nelson.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = E1027 Women’s Architecture Collaborative - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/e1027/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-10-12|last = Burns|first = Karen|date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Burns curated the exhibition ''Insight Out'' with Anna Horne.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Insight/ Out. Exhibition at the 200 Gertrude Street Gallery, 3-25 July 1992|last = Hennessy|first = Peter|date = 1992|journal = Transition|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Piccinini|first2 = Patricia|issue = 39|pages = 68–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took the form of architectural installations at 200 Gertrude Street and five other outdoor sites in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], Melbourne. The exhibition examined urban change, gentrification, housing stress and historical memory.

In 2013 Burns played a key role in establishing Parlour: women, equity, architecture, with [[Justine Clark]], [[Naomi Stead]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome to Parlour - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/about/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview: Justine Clark &amp; Dr Karen Burns, Parlour {{!}} Australian Design Review|url = http://www.australiandesignreview.com/features/27445-interview-justine-clark-dr-karen-burns-parlour|website = www.australiandesignreview.com|accessdate = 2015-10-12|last = Tweeddale|first = Anna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed as a "space to speak" for women in architecture, this provides research, resources and informed opinion about gender equity and architecture. Writing by Burns on Parlour includes:
* Who Wants to be a Woman Architect?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who wants to be a Woman Architect? - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/who-wants-to-be-a-woman-architect/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parlour also ran the 2012 symposium, Transform: Altering the Future of Architecture, which was co-convened by Burns with colleagues Justine Clark and Naomi Stead and hosted by the University of Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transform: Altering the Future of Architecture - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/transform/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transform: Altering the Future of Architecture|url = http://architectureau.com/articles/transform-altering-the-future-of-architecture-1/|website = ArchitectureAU|accessdate = 2015-10-12|last = Kalms|first = Niki|publisher = Architecture Media|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kate Fanny Loder''', later '''Lady Thompson''', (21 August 1825 &amp;ndash; 30 August 1904) was an English composer and pianist.&lt;ref name="Grove_KL"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Temperley | first=Nicholas |editor1-last=Sadie |editor1-first=Stanley |editor2-last= | editor2-first= | encyclopedia=New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |title=Kate (Fanny) Loder (b.

==Biography==
Kate Loder was born on 21 August 1825,&lt;ref name="Grove_KL"/&gt; on Bathwick Street, [[Bathwick]],&lt;ref name=rootsweb&gt;{{cite web|title=Kate Fanny Loder|url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=haydencowan&amp;id=I14727|publisher=Rootsweb|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  within [[Bath, Somerset]] where the Loder family were prominent musicians. Her father was the [[flautist]] [[George Loder (flautist)|George Loder]]. According to ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove]]'', her mother was a piano teacher born Fanny Philpot, who was the sister of the pianist [[Lucy Anderson]].&lt;ref name="Grove_GL"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Temperley | first=Nicholas |editor1-last=Sadie |editor1-first=Stanley |editor2-last= | editor2-first= | encyclopedia=New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |title=George Loder jr (b.

However, genealogical research suggests Kate's mother was Frances Elizabeth Mary Kirkham (1802–50), daughter of Thomas Bulman Kirkham (1778–1845) and Marianne Beville Moore (c.1781 – 1810).&lt;ref name=rootsweb/&gt; Frances Kirkham's step-mother was Jane Harriett Philpot (1802–63), second wife to Thomas Bulman Kirkham and sister of the Lucy Philpot who married the violinist [[George Frederick Anderson]], becoming Lucy Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/18927761/family?cfpid=734276569 |title=Lawleys of Bath Tree |publisher=Ancestry.co.uk |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Kater Loder studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London.  Her performance of [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Mendelssohn's G minor piano concerto]] at the Hanover-square Rooms on 27 May 1843, when she was aged 17, may have been her public debut.&lt;ref&gt;''The Morning Post'', Monday May 29, 1843&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, in 1844, aged just 18, she became the first female professor of harmony at the Royal Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Symphonies|author=Smith, Alice Mary Smith|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The concise Oxford dictionary of opera|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbDbuLJPKBgC&amp;pg=PA295&amp;lpg=PA295&amp;dq=Kate+Loder+(1825%E2%80%931904)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5jPINfqzAT&amp;sig=uSYzknM4G4i-z3lAT2TaUi5bP3Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PxIlTcXEJcT38Abj5vnDAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Kate%20Loder%20(1825%E2%80%931904)&amp;f=false|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|accessdate=5 January 2011|first=

A '''low-residency program''' (or limited residency program) is a form of education, normally at the university level, which involves some amount of [[distance education]] and brief on-campus or specific-site residencies—residencies may be one weekend or several weeks. These programs are most frequently offered by colleges and universities that also teach standard full-time courses on campus. There are numerous [[Master's degree]] programs in a wide range of content areas; one of the most popular limited residency degree programs is the [[Master of Fine Arts]] in [[creative writing]].  The first such program was developed by [[Evalyn Bates]] and launched in 1963 at [[Goddard College]] in [[Plainfield, Vermont]].&lt;ref name="Carlson, Scott"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlson|first=Scott|title=Goddard College Takes a Highly Unconventional Path to Survival|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=Sep 9, 2011|volume=LVIII|pages=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are low-residency MFA programs in creative writing, visual arts, photography, and painting. Other graduate programs that can earn a student a degree include Master of Arts, Master of Science, Master of Business Administration, and Master of Accounting. A few schools offer limited residency undergraduate options: [[Goddard College]], [[Prescott College]], [[Lesley University]], [[New Hampshire Institute of Art]], and [[Union Institute &amp; University]]. 

== Structure ==
Programs vary, but an intensive, low-residency model requires students to come to campus every six months for 1-2 weeks, during which time students engage in a variety of activities and lectures during the day, and create detailed study plans. During the non-residency semester periods, students study independently, sending in "packets" to their faculty mentors every month or so. The content of the packets varies with each individual, but focuses on research, writing, and reflection related to each student's individualized study plan. A few schools, such as Western State Colorado University, actually conduct live online classes via Skype each week during the non-residency periods as well as having instructors reading students' work and provide written feedback weekly.

&lt;ref&gt;cfr. G. De Rosa, L. Sturzo, in Dizionario storico del movimento cattolico italiano. 1860-1980, dir. da F. Traniello e G. Campanini, vol. II (I protagonisti), Casale Monferrato, Marietti, 1982, pp. 614-24. D'obbligo è poi la segnalazione dell'ormai classico lavoro di G. De Rosa Sturzo, Torino, Utet, 1977 (con ampi riferimenti bibliografici alle pp. 483-505).&lt;/ref&gt;
of the Partito Popolare (Italian [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Popular Party]]). The mission of The Luigi Sturzo Institute &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sturzo.it&lt;/ref&gt; is to endorse research in the historical sciences, [[sociology]], political and economical fields by providing vast documentation in the archive library, facilitate canvassers, issue publications and maintain various alliances with other national and international institutes. 
	
Located in [[Palazzo Baldassini]], the institute’s remarkable building was constructed by architect [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Antonio da Sangallo il Giovane]]&lt;ref&gt;Tafuri, Manfredo. Ricerca del Rinascimento. Roma: 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1515. The interior walls are decorated with [[fresco]]s from various artists including several who attended La Scuola di Raffaelo. 
	
Within the edifice, the institute organizes and preserves archives containing documentation specified around the validation of the [[Roman Catholic]] Movement. In the library, other documentation is assembled, more specifically around the [[social science]]s as well as modern and contemporary [[history]]. 
	
Ongoing research in the institute extends to the fields of [[psychology]], [[politics]], history, [[jurisprudence]] and [[economics]]. The conducted research is integrated with seminars organized by the institute to share the new information and provide information in areas of interest. 

The formation sector provides courses for graduates that teach the work specifics of several jobs in the cultural organization career based on the common [[Europe]]an model.

The diffusion and verifications of scientific results are dispersed predominantly by our publications, one of which is our journal, ''Sociologia'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sturzo.it/newsite/pubblica/pub_riv.htm Fondazione Sturzo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325222040/http://www.sturzo.it/newsite/pubblica/pub_riv.htm |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published every four months, which discusses historical and social sciences. 

The institute develops numerous of its activities in collaboration with other national and international institutes.

'''Mahinder Watsa''' is an [[India]]n [[sexologist]] who is well known for his [[sex column]]s in newspapers and magazines and his contributions to promote [[sex education]] in India.&lt;ref name=sexguru&gt;{{cite news|title=Ask the Sexpert: The 90-year-old sex guru|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28353027|accessdate=21 July 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sexpert&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lhendup G. Bhutia|title=An Appointment with the Sexpert|url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/living/an-appointment-with-the-sexpert|accessdate=21 July 2014|work=[[OPEN (magazine)|OPEN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Mahinder Watsa's father was a [[military physician]]. Watsa is [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]. When he was around 7 years old, his family spent some time in [[Rangoon]].&lt;ref name=sexguru/&gt;

During his time at a medical college in Mumbai, Watsa stayed with friends of his family. Through them, he met his future wife, Promila. Despite coming from different backgrounds and castes (he is [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]], she was originally from [[Sindh]]), and going against a tradition of arranged marriages, the two wed after being friends for a number of years. The couple had a son and lived for a while in the 1950s in the [[United Kingdom]], during which time Watsa worked as a hospital [[residency (medicine)|houseman]] and [[Specialist registrar|registrar]]. The family returned to India after his father fell ill and Watsa found work in for [[Glaxo]] as a medical officer, while simultaneously running a private practice as a [[gynecologist]] and [[obstetrician]].&lt;ref name=sexguru/&gt;

Watsa began a career as a columnist in the 1960s when, in his late 30s, he was asked to start writing a medical advice column for a women's magazine. He continued authoring health columns for several women's magazines, such as [[Femina (India)|Femina]], Flair, and Trend, into the 1970s until he encountered resistance from an editor who insisted upon censoring queries about sexual health. Watsa however maintained his writing through numerous alternative outlets including [[List of men's magazines|men's magazines]] (such as 'Fantasy') and, later, websites.&lt;ref name=sexguru/&gt;&lt;ref name=sexpert/&gt;&lt;ref name=sex@90&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pawar|first1=Yogesh|title=Mahinder Watsa: Talking sex @ 90|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-mahinder-watsa-talking-sex-90-1997076|accessdate=21 July 2014|work=[[DNA India]]|date=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the readers of the Femina column had filed an obscenity lawsuit claiming that the publishers were fabricating the letters to increase readership. The editor, Sathya Saran, managed to convince the judge to drop the case by delivering a sack of unopened letters to him.&lt;ref name=ellen_barry/&gt;

Through his work as a columnist he became aware of the lack of [[sex education]] in India. In 1974, while working as a consultant for the [[Family Planning Association of India]] (FPAI), Watsa proposed that a sexual counselling and education program should be introduced. Despite oppositions, FPAI accepted his advice and started India's first sex education, counselling and therapy centre. In 1976, he organised India's first workshop on [[human sexuality]] and family life. The workshop was also addressed by [[Ashok Row Kavi]], a notable [[LGBT rights]] activist in India. In the early 1980s, Watsa left his practice to work full-time in counselling and education.&lt;ref name=sexguru/&gt;

===''Ask the Sexpert'' column===
In 2005, aged 80, Watsa began writing a column called ''Ask the Sexpert'' for the newspaper [[Mumbai Mirror]], which is noted for its witty replies to queries.&lt;ref name=sexguru/&gt; The newspaper has subsequently been threatened with lawsuits and accusations of obscenity.&lt;ref name=sexguru/&gt;&lt;ref name=ignorance&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sean McLain|title=India’s Sex Guru: The Problem is Ignorance|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/11/25/the-problems-indias-sex-guru-faces/|accessdate=21 July 2014|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suchitra Dalvie, a gynaecologist, conducted a study by analysing more than 500 letters sent to the column. According to her, the study revealed a lack of sex education even among urban and relatively well-educated Indians.&lt;ref name=sexguru/&gt; In August 2014, his editor estimated that he has received more 40,000 queries for the column.&lt;ref name=ellen_barry&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barry|first1=Ellen|title=90-Year-Old Sex Columnist Shatters Taboos in India|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/asia/mahinder-watsa-offers-sex-advice-to-indians.html|accessdate=10 November 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2711">'''Markos Mamalakis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Μάρκος Μαμαλάκης; born October 30, 1932) is a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[economist]] specialising in [[Economic development|development]] economics, particularly in [[Latin America]].

Born in [[Salonika]], he graduated from the Experimental High School of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in 1950, then attended the Law School of the University and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Law, with the distinction ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1955. He did graduate work at [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]] from 1955 to 1957, and [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1957 to 1962, where he received his [[Master's degree|M.A.]] (1959), and [[Ph.D.]] (1962) with a dissertation entitled ''Inflation and Growth: An Asset Preference Analysis.

He is a professor of economics at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]].

He was one of the first to argue that there is no "[[wikt:magic bullet|magic bullet]]" to development, but that development solutions must take into account the effects and circumstances of the location. He has published widely on [[macroeconomics]] in developing economies and welfare and sector effects.  He  argued for the fruitfulness of a [[mesoeconomics|mesoeconomic]] analysis of social interactions, rather than a strictly microeconomic or macroecomic approach.

Markos is a father of twelve and grandfather of thirty-seven. He and his wife celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on January 31, 2010.

The '''Mermaid Theatre''' was a theatre encompassing the site of [[Puddle Dock]] and [[Worshipful Company of Curriers|Curriers' Alley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/LONDON-COMPANYS/2000-08/0967625368 www.ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] in the [[City of London]], and the first built in the City since the time of [[Shakespeare]]. It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides.

==History==
The 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor [[Bernard Miles]] with his wife, [[Josephine Wilson]]. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the [[St. John's Wood]] area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' with [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Maggie Teyte]] and [[Thomas Hemsley]], conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McArthur |first=Edwin |date=1965 |title=Flagstad, A Personal Memoir |publisher=A. A. Knopf |location=New York |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, and his revenues from publicity spots for the [[Egg Marketing Board]]; he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the [[Jacobean era]], to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by [[Philip Rosseter]] with distant backing from [[Philip Henslowe|Henslowe]] and [[Edward Alleyn|Alleyn]], was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The new Mermaid Theatre opened in 1959 with a successful production of ''[[Lock Up Your Daughters (musical)|Lock Up Your Daughters]]'' and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as ''[[Cowardy Custard]]'' (often cited{{who|date=October 2015}} as responsible for the revival of interest in [[Noël Coward]]'s works) and including an annual staging of ''[[Treasure Island]]'', with Miles reprising his role of [[Long John Silver]], which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 February 1991 |title=The life and stage of Josephine Wilson – One of the founders of the Molecule Club |first=Donald |last=Gould|work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12917556-900-forum-the-life-and-stage-of-josephine-wilson-one-of-the-founders-of-the-molecule-club/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1961 the poet and author [[Sylvia Plath]] read her poem "Tulips" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, [[Ted Hughes]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Other notable productions include the 1978 première of ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway?]]'', with [[Tom Conti]] and [[Rona Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/10250854/Rona-Anderson.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Obituary: Rona Anderson | date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] sometimes transferred Stratford productions to the Mermaid, including a residency during 1987 which saw the staging of seven plays.&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn2.rsc.org.uk/sitefinity/press-resources/performance-history---june-2016.pdf?sfvrsn=8&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined.

After a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 [[Ken Livingstone]], the [[Mayor of London]], ordered the council to block the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mayor gives theatre a lifeline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/2939777.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, ''[[Friday Night is Music Night]]'' that showcased musicians such as the violinist [[Nigel Kennedy]] and singer [[Josh Groban]]. In 2006, music duo [[Pet Shop Boys]] played a mid-length set accompanied by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled [[Concrete (Pet Shop Boys album)|Concrete]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Loss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans==
In September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the [[Theatres Trust]] and noted actors, producers and artistic directors,&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt; granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer £6 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/18/arts.artsnews | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Ward | title=Manchester theatre eyes Mermaid | date=2003-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners were concerned that the entire building might be demolished.&lt;ref name="Outrage"&gt;{{cite web |first= Lalayn |last= Baluch |date= 30 September 2008 |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/21927/campaigners-outraged-as-city-of-london|title=Outrage as Mermaid Theatre developer released from £6m donation deal |website= [[The Stage]] |accessdate= 11 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former chairman of the Save London's Theatres Campaign, John Levitt, called the decision “a tragedy” and “sheer meanness”.&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt;

In 2018 the Mermaid Theatre still exists as a conference centre called The Mermaid London.

'''Mnemosyne''' (named for the Greek goddess of memory, [[Mnemosyne]]) is a line of [[spaced repetition]] software developed from 2003 until the present.

==Features==
* Spacing algorithm based on an early version of the [[SuperMemo]] algorithm, SM-2,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm SM-2] Optimization of learning, Master's Thesis, University of Technology in Poznan, 1990 and adapted for publishing as an independent article on the web. (P.A.Wozniak, May 10, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; with some modifications that deal with early and late repetitions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/principles.php Principles]", The Mnemosyne Project, retrieved June 3rd, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* Supports [[Image|pictures]], [[sound]], [[video]], [[HTML]], Flash and [[LaTeX]]
* Portable (can be installed on a [[USB stick]])
* Categorization of cards
* Learning progress statistics
* Stores learning data (represented as decks of cards that each have a question and an answer side) in ".mem" database files, which are interoperable with a number of other spaced repetition applications
* Plugins and [[JavaScript]] support
* Review cards on Android devices.
* Synchronization between other machines

== Overview ==
Each day, the software displays each card that is scheduled for repetition. The user then grades their recollection of the card's answer on a scale of 0-5. The software then schedules the next repetition of the card in accordance with the user's rating of that particular card and the database of cards as a whole. This produces an active, rather than passive, review process.

==Software==
Mnemosyne is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], which allows for its use on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and {{nowrap|[[Mac OS X]]}}. A client program for review on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices is also available but needs to be synchronized by the desktop program. Users of the software usually make their own database of cards, although pre-made Mnemosyne databases are available, and it is possible to import SuperMemo collections and text files. [[SQLite]] is used by the program to store files.

==Research==
Mnemosyne collects data from volunteering users, and is a research project{{clarify|In what capacity? Associated with a university?|date=April 2017}} on [[long-term memory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/principles.php&lt;/ref&gt;

An August 2009 version of the dataset was made available via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/mnemosyne-proj-users/browse_thread/thread/5f7ede5242badc9f Announcement]; [http://www.legittorrents.info/index.php?page=torrent-details&amp;id=29b67f580ed97d6a10429697d5006c3eb47b2f18 torrent index]&lt;/ref&gt; a January 2014 version is available for download.&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mnemosyne-proj-users/tPHlkTFVX_4/oF61BF44iQkJ&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the latest version is available from the author, Peter Bienstman, upon request.&lt;ref&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/mnemosyne-proj-users/browse_thread/thread/e00801ebb3bbfa72&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philippine Registry of Cultural Property''', abbreviated as '''PRECUP''' is a national registry of the [[Philippine Government]] used to consolidate in one record all cultural property that are deemed important to the [[cultural heritage]], tangible and intangible, of the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="RA1066"&gt;Section 14, Republic Act No. 10066.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 11, 2018, the entries in the newly-updated PRECUP was at 3,921. Additionally, 1,259 out of 1,715 LGUs (provincial, municipal/city-levels), or 73 percent of LGUs have established local cultural inventories (LCI).&lt;ref&gt;http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/296974/unregulated-infrastructure-projects-threat-cultural-heritage/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
This registry was established by the [[National Cultural Heritage Act]] of 2009 ([[Republic Act]] No. 10066) Section 14 which says "All cultural property of the country deemed important to cultural heritage shall be registered in the Philippine Registry of Cultural Property."

==Implementation==
The [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] is mandated to establish and maintain the registry, through the appropriate cultural agencies and local government units, within three years from the effectivity of the act. As stated in Section 14 of said legislation, the guidelines in the registration of cultural property are as follows:&lt;ref name="RA1066"/&gt;

{{cquote|(a) All cultural agencies concerned shall individually maintain an inventory, evaluation and documentation of all cultural properties it has declared according to their category and shall submit the same to the Commission. For cultural property declared as Immovable Cultural Property, the appropriate cultural agency shall, after registration, give due notice to the Registry of Deeds having jurisdiction for annotation on the land titles pertaining to the same;

(b) Local government units, through their cultural offices, shall likewise maintain an inventory of cultural property under its jurisdiction and shall furnish the Commission a copy of the same;

(c) Both cultural agencies concerned and local government units shall continuously coordinate in making entries and in monitoring the various cultural properties in their respective inventory;

(d) All government agencies and instrumentalities, government-owned and/or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, including public and private educational institutions, shall report their ownership and/or possession of such items to the pertinent cultural agency and shall register such properties within three (3) years from the effectivity of this Act;

(e) Private collectors and owners of cultural property shall register such properties, within three (3) years from the effectivity of this Act. The private collectors and owners of cultural property shall not be divested of their possession and ownership thereof even after registration of said property as herein required.

Information on registered cultural properties owned by private individuals shall remain confidential and may be given only upon prior consent of the private owner. The Commission shall operate the Registry in the NCCA portal cultural databank.}}

===Issue on ownership===
It was clarified that by its enactment, Republic Act No. 10066 does not transfer ownership of the properties, identified as part of the Philippines' cultural heritage, to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Anthony Henares.

The '''pre-university course''' or  '''pre-degree course''', popularly abbreviated to PUC or PDC, is an intermediate course (which is known as 10+2) of two years' duration, conducted by state education institutions or boards in [[India]]. This pre-university course is also known as the '''Plus-two''' or '''Intermediate course'''. A person desiring admission to an Indian university must pass this course, which can be considered as a degree bridge course to prepare students for university education.

Admission to this course is based on marks obtained for the [[SSLC|Secondary School Leaving Certificate]], awarded after successful completion of five years of [[primary school]], followed by five years of [[secondary school]]. The Indian education system follows a 10+2+3 (4 or 5) pattern, so that a bachelor's degree requires a minimum of 10 years of school, plus two years of PUC, plus either three, four or five years at university. Colleges offering a pre-university course are known as PU Colleges or [[Junior colleges]] in India.

For example, the state of [[Karnataka]] conducts examinations at the end of the second year of the PUC for university admissions. This has three program streams with options focusing on science, commerce and arts, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govindadasacollege.com/courses.htm|title=Courses offered|accessdate=2010-01-20|publisher=www.govindadasacollege.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113214209/http://www.govindadasacollege.com/courses.htm|archivedate=2010-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students desiring to study professional programs in [[Karnataka]] must pass the science stream of this exam and qualify through the [[Common Entrance Test]] of the state. Recently, the Karnataka PUC Board made the first-year PUC exams public, to filter out low-scoring students and improve overall average scores. Only about 40% of students usually pass the exam, and only about 1.5% score above 85% overall.

== Courses after PUC==
Students who have completed the PUC in the science stream can enroll in specialist degree courses in [[nursing]], [[pharmacy]], [[agriculture]], engineering or medicine. They can also enroll for a pure-sciences [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]]. Admission to these courses depends upon marks scored in PUC exams conducted by the institutes or by the state board.

Students who succeed in the commerce stream may enroll in a graduate [[Bachelor of Commerce]] or [[Bachelor of Business Management]] degree program at an Indian university.

Those who have passed the arts-stream PUC can opt to study for a Bachelor of Arts (B.A) or Diploma in Education (DEd), Bachelor of Social Work (BSW), or may be admitted to vocational programs in fashion design — offered by the National Institute of Fashion Design (NIFT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nift.ac.in/admissions1.html|title =Admissions |accessdate= 2010-01-20 |publisher=http://www.nift.ac.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; — or apparel and knitwear manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atdcindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&amp;task=admissionvocational|title=ATDC vocational training|accessdate=2010-01-20|publisher=http://www.atdcindia.co.in|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208075049/http://www.atdcindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&amp;task=admissionvocational|archivedate=2010-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Euler''' (named after [[Leonhard Euler]]) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/opinion/the-importance-of-recreational-math.html| title=The importance of recreational math |last=Suri |first=Manil |date=2015-10-12 |access-date=2018-06-05 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Learning to Program|series=Addison-Wesley learning series|first=Steven|last=Foote|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2014|isbn=9780789753397|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4IhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project attracts adults and students interested in [[mathematics]] and [[computer programming]].  Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; It includes over 600 problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projecteuler.net/problems |title=Project Euler (list of problems) |accessdate = 2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new one added once every two weeks. Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.  {{as of|May 2018}} Project Euler has about 800,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://projecteuler.net/statistics|title=About - Project Euler|last=Hughes|first=Colin|website=projecteuler.net|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; users, from all over the world, who have solved at least one problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projecteuler.net/statistics |title=Project Euler (Statistics) - login required |accessdate = 2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of the site==
A forum specific to each question may be viewed after the user has correctly answered the given question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projecteuler.net/about |title=Project Euler - About |accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems can be sorted on ID, number solved and difficulty. Participants can track their progress through achievement levels based on the number of problems solved. A new level is reached for every 25 problems solved. Special awards exist for solving special combinations of problems, for instance there is an award for solving fifty prime numbered problems. A special "Eulerians" level exists to track achievement based on the fastest fifty solvers of recent problems so that newer members can compete without solving older problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://projecteuler.net/news_archives |title=Project Euler (News Archives) |accessdate = 2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example problem and solutions ==
The first Project Euler problem is
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though this problem is much simpler than the typical problem, it serves to illustrate the potential difference that an efficient algorithm makes. The [[brute-force search|brute-force]] algorithm examines every natural number less than 1000 and keeps a running sum of those meeting the criteria. This method is simple to implement, as shown by the following [[pseudocode]]:

&lt;pre&gt;
Set TOTAL to 0;
for NUM from 1 through 999 do
  if NUM mod 3 = 0 or if NUM mod 5 = 0 then
    add NUM to TOTAL;
output TOTAL
&lt;/pre&gt;

For harder problems, it becomes increasingly important to find an efficient algorithm. For this problem, we can reduce 1000 operations to a few by using the [[inclusion–exclusion principle]] and a [[Closed-form expression|closed-form]] [[summation]] formula.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathrm{sum}_{\text {3 or 5}}(n) &amp; = \mathrm{sum}_3(n) + \mathrm{sum}_5(n) - \mathrm{sum}_{15}(n) \\[4pt]

\mathrm{sum}_k(n) &amp; = \sum_{i=1}^{\left \lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right \rfloor} ki \\[4pt]

\sum_{i=1}^p ki &amp; = \frac{kp(p+1)}{2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sum}_k(n)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the sum of multiples of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; below &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
In [[big O notation]], the brute-force algorithm is O(''n'') and the efficient algorithm is O(1) (assuming constant time arithmetic operations).

'''Reading Is Fundamental, Inc. (RIF)''' is the largest non-profit children's [[literacy]] [[organization]] in the [[United States]]. RIF is committed to a literate America by inspiring a passion for reading among all children, providing quality content and resources to make an impact, and engaging communities in the solution to give every child the fundamentals for success.  RIF is the leading champion for children’s literacy, empowering millions of children to read, learn, and grow.

==History==

While reading to children at a school in Washington, D.C. Margaret McNamara, wife of the United States Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, was surprised to learn that many of the students did not have any books of their own.  That experience in 1966 led to the formation of Reading Is Fundamental (RIF), a nonprofit children's literacy organization dedicated to making reading a fun and beneficial part of everyday life.  In the first year, 41,000 D.C. school children received 200,000 books. With the help of a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] in 1967, the RIF bookmobile was launched, expanding reach and impact outside of the classroom.  Following the success RIF had in Washington, the Ford Foundation increased RIF's grant to $285,000 in August 1968, enabling RIF to launch ten model programs across the country. From these early beginnings, RIF evolved into a national motivating force for literacy.

In 2001, [[Carol Rasco]], the former senior adviser to [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Richard Riley]], became the president and CEO of RIF.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/carol-rasco|title=Carol Rasco {{!}} HuffPost|website=www.huffingtonpost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communications department encouraged her to start blogging to help the organization attain its goals of improving its reach.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.childrensbooksandreviews.com/children-reading-and-literacy-interview-with-carol-rasco-reading-is-fundamental/|title=Interview: Carol Rasco, Reading is Fundamental|last=Mead|first=Aaron|date=2010-10-30|work=Children's Books and Reviews|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Congress approved and President [[Barack Obama]] signed a bill that cut all federal funding for RIF.&lt;ref&gt;The source explains "More than a dozen education programs—including high-profile efforts focused on literacy, teaching, and learning—face the prospect of a permanent federal funding loss after they were chopped from a stopgap spending measure signed into law by President Barack Obama last week.
The temporary spending law, intended to keep the government running until March 18 while Democrats and Republicans try to hash out a deal for the rest of the fiscal year, finances most federal programs at fiscal year 2010 levels.
But education programs such as Even Start, Striving Readers, and the privately organized Teach For America, ended up taking dramatic hits after Republican leaders insisted on cuts even in the temporary spending bill. The measure slashes nearly $750 million from the U.S Department of Education’s most recent overall discretionary budget of $46.6 billion, excluding Pell Grant funding.
Literacy programs bore the brunt. The funding for Striving Readers, which was financed at $250 million, was eliminated. The Even Start family-literacy effort lost its $67 million appropriation.".[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/04/reading-is-fundamental_n_831545.html]&lt;/ref&gt; During the budget cuts, several newspapers across the United States published Rasco's commentary on the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-parenting/post/reading-is-fundamental-unless-its-too-expensive/2011/11/02/gIQAAZtsiM_blog.html|title=Reading is Fundamental (unless it’s too expensive)|last=D'Arcy|first=Janice|date=2011-11-03|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, RIF celebrated its 50th anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Reading Is Fundamental|title=Carol Rasco, President and CEO of RIF|date=2015-11-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5Z56BUd10|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released the results of Read for Success, a two-year research study funded by a grant from the Department of Education. Read for Success is centered around motivating children to read by providing access to high-quality classroom book collections, summer books for students to choose and own, enriching STEAM-themed classroom activities, professional development for teachers and parent engagement.

Rasco left in 2016, succeeded by Alicia Levi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To date, RIF has given 412 million books to more than 40 million children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rif.org/what-we-offer/books-for-ownership/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
RIF has 400,000 volunteers across all U.S. states and territories provide 4.5 million children with 15 million books and a growing number of literacy resources each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://readingisfundamental.org/us/about-rif.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/reading-is-fundamental-combats-summer-slide/ |title=Reading Is Fundamental Combats 'Summer Slide'|last=Lahey|first=Jessica|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; RIF's largest priority is providing books and companion literacy resources for underprivileged children from birth to age 10.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4390|title=Charity Navigator - Rating for Reading Is Fundamental|website=Charity Navigator|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RIF's flagship program is '''Books for Ownership''' (formerly known as the National Book Program), which also supplies children with free paperback books. By 1989 the RIF had distributed 100 million books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/2685676/ |date=August 15, 1989 |newspaper=The Kokomo Tribune |title=Books and socks paired up for kids |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Irish Academy''' ('''RIA'''; {{lang-ga|Acadamh Ríoga na hÉireann}}), based in [[Dublin]], is an [[all-Ireland]], independent academic body that promotes study and excellence in the sciences, humanities and social sciences. It is one of Ireland's premier [[List of Irish learned societies|learned societies]] and [[List of Irish cultural institutions|cultural institutions]], and currently has around 501 members including Honorary Members, elected in recognition of their academic achievements. The Academy was established in 1785 and granted a [[royal charter]] in 1786.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Peter (2003). "Royal Irish Academy", in Lalor, Brian (ed) ''Encyclopaedia of Ireland'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, pp 948–949.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the late 19th century the Royal Irish Academy was also the owner of the main national collection of Irish antiquities.  It presented its collection of archaeological artefacts and similar items, which included such famous pieces as the [[Tara Brooch]], the [[Cross of Cong]] and the [[Ardagh Chalice]] to what is now the [[National Museum of Ireland]], but retains its very significant collection of manuscripts including the famous [https://www.ria.ie/cathach-psalter-st-columba Cathach of Colmcille], the [[Book of the Dun Cow]] (c. 1100), the later medieval [[Leabhar Breac]], the [[Book of Ballymote]], and the [[Annals of the Four Masters]].

==Mission statement==
The Academy has issued the following mission statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Royal Irish Academy, the academy for the sciences and humanities for the whole of Ireland, will vigorously promote excellence in scholarship, recognise achievements in learning, direct research programmes and undertake its own research projects, particularly in areas relating to Ireland and its heritage.

It will reflect upon, advise on and contribute to, public debate and public policy formation on issues of major interest in science, technology and culture.

It will continue to offer an independent forum to Irish scholars, it will provide a network of support for scholarly disciplines through its network of academy committees, it will maintain and enhance its unique library, it will publish scholarly papers and it will represent the world of Irish learning internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mission statement |publisher=Royal Irish Academy |url=http://www.ria.ie/about/governance/mission-statement.aspx |accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Membership==
Election to Membership of the Royal Irish Academy is a public recognition of academic excellence and is sometimes held to be the highest academic honour in Ireland. Those elected are entitled to use the designation "MRIA" after their name. The criterion for election to Membership is a significant contribution to scholarly research as shown in the candidate's published academic work. However some of those elected to membership are not academics at all but receive the accolade in recognition of other contributions to society - these include former public servants, philanthropists, leaders in political and business life, and others (see Notable Members below).  

To be elected, a candidate has to be proposed and recommended by five Members, and selection is made by a rotating committee of existing Members, their names not made known outside the Academy. Presently, twenty Members are elected each year, equally divided between the sciences and humanities. Membership is open only to those resident in Ireland. 

Honorary Membership can be awarded to persons who have made outstanding contribution to their academic discipline, but who are normally resident outside the island of Ireland. At least two existing Members must propose and recommend a candidate for Honorary Membership. Honorary members are entitled to use the designation "Hon. MRIA" after their name.

==Publishing==
The Academy is one of the longest-established publishers in Ireland, beginning in 1787. The Academy currently publishes six journals: ''[[Ériu (journal)|Ériu]]'', ''Irish Studies in International Affairs'', ''Mathematical Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'', ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Section C'', ''Irish Journal of Earth Sciences'' and ''Biology and Environment'' . The Academy's research projects also regularly publish the ''Irish Historic Towns Atlas'' series, the ''Documents on Irish Foreign Policy'', ''[[Foclóir Stairiúil na Nua-Ghaeilge|Foclóir na nua-Ghaeilge]]'', the ''Dictionary of Medieval Latin from Celtic Sources'', and the ''New Survey of Clare Island''. In 2014 the Academy published (in association with [[Yale University Press]]) the five-volume ''Art and Architecture of Ireland''.

The Academy is committed to publishing work which not only influences scholarship, but also the wider community, for example ''Flashes of Brilliance'' by Dick Ahlstrom, and ''Judging Dev'' by [[Diarmaid Ferriter]]. Both of these publications have been accompanied by either a television or a radio series.

==Academy committees==
During the 1950s the Academy began forming national committees, each relating to a specific discipline. Today the main focus of the Academy committees is to serve as a strategic vehicle for the disciplines they represent, and to act as a national forum, providing input into policy, research priorities and issues of public concern, such as [[climate change]]. They also organise public outreach activities, such as lectures and public interviews, and award grants for research and travel. The Academy committees are made up of both Members and non-Members, including representatives from universities, research institutions, government agencies and, where appropriate, industry.

'''Science Committees:''' Climate Change and Environmental Sciences; Engineering and Computer Sciences; Geosciences and Geographical Sciences; Life and Medical Sciences; Physical, Chemical and Mathematical Sciences

'''Humanities and Social Sciences Committees:''' Ethical, Political, Legal and Philosophical Studies; Historical Studies; Social Sciences; Study of Languages, Literature, Culture and Communication; Coiste Léann na Gaeilge, Litríocht na Gaeilge agus na gCultúr Ceilteach

==Academy House==
[[File:Royal Irish Academy.jpg|thumb|Royal Irish Academy building on Dawson Street]]
In 1852 the Royal Irish Academy moved from 114 [[Grafton Street]] to its current premises at 19 [[Dawson Street]], [[Dublin 2]], known as "Academy House".&lt;ref name="Raifeartaigh, T.O. 1985"/&gt; Built in c.1750, the building has some fine decorative plasterwork and a handsome meeting room designed in 1854 by [[Frederick Clarendon]] and now used for conferences, exhibitions and public talks. Academy House was home to many of Ireland's finest national treasures, including the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and the [[Tara Brooch]], until 1890 when the Academy transferred its collections to the newly established [[National Museum of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/history.asp?site_id=0] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503161004/http://www.museum.ie/history.asp?site_id=0 |date=3 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy Library holds the largest collection of [[Old Irish]] manuscripts in the world.&lt;ref name="Raifeartaigh, T.O. 1985"&gt;Raifeartaigh, T.O. (1985). ''The Royal Irish Academy: A bicentennial history 1785–1985''. Dublin: Royal Irish Academy.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important research centre for studies covering Irish history, [[Irish language|language]], [[archaeology]] and the history of Irish science. The Library is home to the sixth-century Latin [[psalter]], the [[Cathach of St. Columba|''Cathach'']], reputedly copied by [[St Columcille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mary |last=Jones |url=http://www.maryjones.us/jce/cathach.html |title=An Cathach |work=Jones's Celtic Encyclopedia |publisher=Maryjones.us |date= |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library also holds the personal library of [[Thomas Moore]] and the [[philological]] collection of [[Osborn Bergin|Osborn J. Bergin]].

==Cunningham Medal==
The Academy’s premier award is its Cunningham Medal,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ria.ie/ga/grants-and-awards/cunningham-medal Royal Irish Academy: Cunningham Medal]&lt;/ref&gt; which was established in 1796 at the bequest of barrister [[Timothy Cunningham]] of [[Gray's Inn]].

After a period of uncertainty and experimentation regarding the terms and conditions of the award, it was agreed in 1848 that the medals would be open to the authors of works or essays in the areas of Science, Polite Literature and Antiquities, published in Ireland or about Irish subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| jstor= 20489903| title= Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy (1836-1869)|publisher= Royal Irish Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medal is awarded every three years to Members of the Academy in recognition of "outstanding contributions to scholarship and the objectives of the Academy" &lt;ref name = MED/&gt;

'''Savivo''' is a Danish [[e-learning]] [[company]] based in [[Copenhagen]]. The company was founded in 2006, and is known for their [[educational game]]s, which has millions of users around the world.

Savivo started out developing content for [[web browser]]s, and has since embraced [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablets]] running on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].

==History==
Savivo was founded in 2006 by company [[CEO]] Stephan Stephensen. The name itself reflects the philosophy of the company. Savivo is a [[portmanteau]] of the words savvy and vivo, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for [[life]].

The company's first project was the first educational game, Mingoville English, which purpose is to help children learn [[English language|English]]. Mingoville English was designed and developed as part of a project initiated by Denmark’s IT Center for Education and Research under the auspices of the [[Danish Ministry of Education]].

In 2008 Savivo developed [[Savivo#SkoleMat|SkoleMat]], a series of [[Mathematics|math]] games. SkoleMat is designed to cover the entire [[Danish Folkeskole Education|Danish Folkeskole]] from [[pre-school]] up to lower [[secondary education]]. In 2012 the first part of SkoleMat, called Mondiso which covers first to third grade, was released in English.

In 2009 the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] government appointed Savivo to integrate Mingoville English on half a million of [[Intel]]’s [[Classmate PC]]s in Portugal. 1.000 Classmate PCs were also sent to [[Botswana]].&lt;ref name="Mingoville is on a half mission ClassMate PCs"&gt;[http://onokah.blogspot.dk/2008/12/mingoville-is-on-half-million-classmate.html Mingoville Is On Half A Million ClassMate PCs Called Magalhães]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The same year, Savivo joined the Chilean government’s ''Chile habla Ingles'' campaign,&lt;ref name="Chile habla Inglés"&gt;[http://www.chilehablaingles.com/ Chile habla Inglés. Retrieved 2013-09-10.]&lt;/ref&gt; to combat English illiteracy in Chile. Within two weeks of the campaign, more than 200,000 Chileans signed up for Mingoville English.

In 2011, Savivo approached all major [[Telephone company|telephone companies]] in Denmark, e.g. [[TDC A/S|TDC]], [[Telenor]], [[3 Mobile#Denmark and Sweden|3]] and [[TeliaSonera|Telia]] to enable their Math app for mobile phones to be streamed for free to all school children in Denmark.

In 2012, Savivo entered a partnership with the Danish publishing house [[Gyldendal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bogmarkedet.dk/nyheder/gyldendal-allierer-sig-med-mingoville "Gyldendal allurer sig med Mingoville", ''BogMarkedet'', August 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; a partnership where the two companies will develop new digital learning content and gain a larger presence abroad.

In 2013, Savivo saw international success. The [[iPad]] version of Mingoville Preschool was well received in China, where it held the first place in the highly competitive Chinese app market.&lt;br&gt;
In the beginning of September, Mingoville Preschool started a similar rise to the top in [[Latin America]]. The app occupied the top 3 positions in [[iTunes|iTunes']] education category in a number of countries, e.g. [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]].

==Stephan Stephensen==
With a background in business, Stephan Stephensen's first foray into e-learning was a program designed to teach refugees Danish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/savivo-blog-assets/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Savivo+Media+Kit.pdf Savivo Media Kit, Copenhagen 2013, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; He is responsible for the company's [[Philosophy of education|learning philosophy]] and proponent of e- and [[m-learning]] in all their incarnations. The potential of m-learning in various areas of the world, like Africa, is something he continues to explore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.mingoville.com/es/company/news/44-mingoville-is-preparing-to-go-to-egypt.html ''Mingoville team is going to Egypt to explore new partnership on the African continent'' - Mingoville.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning philosophy==
Savivo utilizes various teaching approaches in their apps. Besides using [[gamification]] elements to increase the time children play the games, Savivo is a proponent for [[learning through play]]. Savivo's approach is structured and uses both dialogue and visual elements to stimulate learning.

According to a report created by a series of consultants and [[Copenhagen Municipality]],&lt;ref name="Analyse og vurdering af ITiF-læremidler"&gt;[http://www.digitalelaeremidler.dk/media%289283,1030%29/Analyse_og_vurderign_af_ITiF-l%C3%A6remidler_2010.pdf ''Analyse og vurdering af ITiF-læremidler'', Copenhagen 2010, p. 119]&lt;/ref&gt; students feel challenged by Mingoville English and think they learn more English from playing the game. The strong focus on dialogue between child and game are used to explain topics and subjects in a dynamic way.

In the virtual world, the safety of the children is guaranteed thanks to Savivo's Safe Chat-system,&lt;ref name="Mingoville Safe Chat"&gt;[http://blog.savivo.com/2013/07/25/mingoville-the-safe-virtual-world/ "''Mingoville: The safe virtual world''" - From Savivo's blog]&lt;/ref&gt; which only allows pre-approved words to be used.

Mingoville English features voice acting with voice actors from both [[North America]], [[Australia]] and the [[UK]]. Native voice actors ensure that the children are exposed to as authentic an English experience as possible. Mingoville English was developed with the assistance of English teachers and the program has a comprehensive system for handling [[lesson plans]], [[homework]] and [[grading (education)|grading]].

While Mingoville English is the flagship of Savivo, the universe and activities have spun off several other games and apps. Most notably the Mingoville Preschool app, which shortly after release climbed the [[China|Chinese]] [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and claimed the first place.&lt;ref name="Preschool triumphs in China"&gt;[http://blog.savivo.com/2013/04/15/preschool-triumphs-in-china/ "''Preschool triumphs in China''" - From Savivo's blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Mingoville English was developed for web browsers, a new and enhanced version of Mingoville English is being developed for both web, iOS and Android.

General '''Secondary Education in Cyprus''' is a six-year [[educational program]] for [[students]] between the ages of 12 and 18. The Upper cycle of the Public Secondary General Education offers a three-year program for older students between the ages of 15 and 18.

It is made up of the [[Gymnasium (school)]] (Lower Secondary School), where the main concentration is a general [[humanistic]] education. Education is compulsory until the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moec.gov.cy/dme/en/gymnasium.html DEPARTMENT OF SECONDARY GENERAL EDUCATION Gymnasium]&lt;/ref&gt; From there students attend the Lykeio/[[Lyceum]] (Upper Secondary School), a more flexible [[educational system]] which offers various specializations depending on the inclinations, skills and interests of the students. Technical and vocational tracks are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moec.gov.cy/dme/en/index.html DEPARTMENT OF SECONDARY GENERAL EDUCATION]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schedule==
The school year runs from September 10 to May 20. Students attend classes Monday through Friday, from 7:30 AM to 1:35 PM. Breaks occur  at 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. for 15 minutes, at 10:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. for 25 minutes and at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. for 10 minutes. Periods are 45 minutes in length and students have 35 periods each week.

School Holidays are October 1, October 28, December 23 until January 6, January 30, March 25, April 1, May 1, Good Monday (the Friday after [[Easter Week]]), Holy Spirit, Green Monday and the Summer holidays from June to September.

==Certification of secondary education==
* Unified Lyceum: An indicative certificate (for those who successfully complete grades A and B) or a School Leaving Certificate (APOLYTERION), for those who graduate, is awarded at the end of the school year to all successful students. The School Leaving Certificate is a qualification for employment in office work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justaboutcyprus.com/cyprus_education_secondary_education.html Cyprus Education - Secondary Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Secondary Technical and [[Vocational Education]]: After successfully completing the program, students of TVE are awarded a School Leaving Certificate (APOLYTERION), which is recognized as equivalent to a School Leaving Certificate of a public three-grade Upper - Secondary school.

==Clubs ==
The Unified Lyceum Program "Action – Creativity – Social Contribution" (ACS) is organized by the [[school]] and is approved by the Ministry of Education and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/citizenship/pdf/national_report_cy_en.pdf Study on Volunteering in the European Union Country Report Cyprus]&lt;/ref&gt; The program is compulsory for all students and is a prerequisite to successful completion of each grade and for obtaining a school leaving certificate. The activities that have been organized by schools so far, are now regulated, enriched and upgraded through this program.

==Uniforms==
[[School uniform|Uniforms]] are compulsory.&lt;ref name=cl&gt;[http://cyprus-life.info/cyprus_education.html Education in Cyprus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202114407/http://cyprus-life.info/cyprus_education.html |date=2014-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The uniform consists of grey trousers or jeans for boys, grey skirts or jeans for girls and white, black or grey T-shirts.  A special uniform is required for PE classes.

==Costs==
[[Secondary education]] in [[Cyprus]] is free for all students.

==Private lessons==
Private lessons in Cyprus are very common. Almost all students prepare for external exams, usually [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] A´ and O´ Levels through private tuition, to ensure access to foreign universities, especially in the [[UK]]. Many students, especially in Lyceum, take private lessons for difficult [[Course (education)|subjects]].&lt;ref name=cl/&gt;

==Access to higher education==
Access to Public Tertiary Institutions in [[Cyprus]] and [[Greece]] can be achieved through the National Entrance exams, while the School Leaving Certificate can ensure access to private tertiary institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroeducation.net/prof/cypco.htm The European Education Directory - Cyprus]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sigfrid Gauch''' (born 9 March 1945) is a German writer. He lives in Mainz.

Gauch is the son of [[Hermann Gauch]], a [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] official and member of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. He was born in [[Offenbach-Hundheim]] in the last few weeks of the [[Second World War]]. His parents separated when he was a young boy.&lt;ref name = "cop"&gt;Copley, Antony, "Hitler's Children, A Preface to Sigfid Gauch's Vaterspuren", in Gauch, Sigfrid, ''Traces of My Father'', trans. [[William Radice]], Northwestern University Press, xi-xx.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the Universities of [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]] and [[University of Mainz|Mainz]].

He worked as a school teacher, teaching German, philosophy and ethics at the ''Integrierte Gesamtschule'' in [[Mainz]]. He was awarded a doctorate from the University of Mainz in 1985 for a dissertation on "Overt and covert spellings in literary [[Jacobinism]]". It was later published as ''Friedrich Joseph Emerich – ein deutscher Jakobiner. Studien zu Leben und Werk''.

In the 1970s Gauch published essays and poetry. He made his name with his book ''Vaterspuren'' (Traces of My Father) in 1979, an influential memoir that began what later became a genre of literature about children of Nazi parents attempting to come to terms with their family's past.&lt;ref&gt;Figge, Susan, "Father books: Memoirs of the Children of Fascist Fathers", ''Revealing Lives'', Yallom and Bell, eds, pp 196-200.&lt;/ref&gt; He later published ''Fundsachen. Die Quellen zum Roman Vaterspuren'', a collection of primary source material related to the book. His novels ''Winterhafen'' (2010) and ''Schattenbilder'' (2012) explore the same issues through fiction.&lt;ref name = "cop"/&gt;

In addition to his novels, short stories and poetry collections Gauch has co-edited numerous anthologies, especially with regard to literature from [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], including, from 1994, the ''Rheinland-pfälzisches Jahrbuch für Literatur'' (Rhineland-Palatinate Yearbook of literature) published by Brandes &amp; Apsel. Since 2002 this has come out under the title ''Jahrbuch für Literatur'' (Yearbook for Literature). Since 2004 he has edited the Edition Schrittmacher series of books, of which 30 volumes have been published.

'''''SimPark''''' is a 1996 [[video game]] by [[Maxis]]. The object of the game is to cultivate and manage a successful [[park]]. Similar to ''[[SimTown]]'', it is targeted more towards [[child]]ren than the average player.  ''SimPark'' attempts to show the importance of [[ecology|ecological]] balance. It could well be considered a 'lite' version of ''[[SimIsle: Missions in the Rainforest|SimIsle]]''.

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:Simpark.jpeg|thumb|left|''SimPark'' screenshot]]
Players have to quickly learn how doing (or not doing) various things will affect how their park grows.  For instance, if certain [[flower]] types aren't planted, the park won't attract [[bee]]s.  If the bees aren't flying around the park, then [[pollination]] won't occur, which is an important aspect of keeping the park growing.  On top of properly managing the [[plant]] and [[animal]] population, players are also required to identify the park's plants and animals.

Players often receive in-game email, such as their boss telling them to make the park more diverse, or their virtual mother telling about life back at home (e.g.: "I baked you a cake..." etc.) Occasionally, the Boss's pet frog Rizzo will make an appearance on the screen to give the player advice, or nag about the way they're handling things.

The park can experience disasters, including:
*[[Waste|Garbage]] Dump: The Garbage Dump is just a big pile of rubbish. As soon as it is made, rats start to produce from it and inhabit your park. The only way to get rid of the garbage dump is to put water on it or place lots of garbage-eating animals such as rats and black bears, around the garbage dump.
*[[Fire]]
* [[Kudzu]]
* [[Alien invasion]]: The Alien Invasion consists of flat, pink-and-blue creatures that litter the park grounds and sometimes float on the water. If the map is clicked to get a zoomed-out map view, the pattern the Aliens form may be in the shape of letters. One example of this is a message which reads: "Surrender, Dorothy". This is a parody of the movie ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. The only way to get rid of aliens, aside from using cheat codes, is to bulldoze them with the "[[Bulldozer]]" tool.

The option of using a microphone feature allows you to click on park-goers and listen to what they have to say. Some of the more memorable quotes include, "My socks don't match," "I didn't brush my teeth this morning," "Eddie! Oh Eddie! Where are you?" and "My favourite book is ''Wind in the Willows."

'''Song Yoo-geun''' (born November 27, 1997) is a [[South Korea]]n ex-[[graduate school]] student, who has been enrolled in the [[Korean University of Science and Technology]] (UST) from 2008 to 2017. He is broadly known as 'Genius Boy' in South Korea since 2004. 

In October 2015, his first paper, written with his advisor, Dr. [[Park Seok-jae]], entitled "Axisymmetric, Nonstationary Black Hole Magnetospheres: Revisited"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = AXISYMMETRIC, NONSTATIONARY BLACK HOLE MAGNETOSPHERES: REVISITED|url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/812/1/8|journal = The Astrophysical Journal|volume = 812|issue = 1|doi = 10.1088/0004-637x/812/1/8|first = Yoo Geun|last = Song|first2 = Seok Jae|last2 = Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in the ''[[Astrophysical Journal]]'' (ApJ). As UST requires one published paper in a journal listed in the [[Science Citation Index]] as a graduation requirement, this article, along with his Ph.D. defense titled "Astrophysical Applications of General Relativity"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title = 천재소년 송유근, 내년 2월 최연소 박사 된다|url = http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2015/11/18/0200000000AKR20151118066700063.HTML|website = 연합뉴스|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; qualified him to apply for a Ph.D. degree to be conferred in February 2016. This would have made him the youngest-ever Korean to earn a Ph.D. degree.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the paper was soon retracted due to plagiarizing a 2002 book chapter.&lt;ref name="plagiarism1"&gt;{{cite web |author=The Astrophysical Journal |title=Astrophysical Journal Paper Retracted for Plagiarism | URL = http://aas.org/posts/news/2015/11/astrophysical-journal-paper-retracted-plagiarism |accessdate=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plagiarism2"&gt;{{cite web |author=Retraction Watch |title=Black hole paper by teenaged prodigy retracted for duplication | URL = http://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/black-hole-paper-by-teenaged-prodigy-retracted-for-duplication |accessdate=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life before October 2015 ==
Song Yoo-geun left a prodigy school he attended in 2003. Six months of his independent study enabled him to solve pre-calculus problems. In August 2004, at age 6, he passed [http://www.q-net.or.kr/crf005.do?id=crf00503&amp;jmCd=6921 "Craftsman Information Processing" (정보처리기능사)] certification examination. In November of the same year, his parents tried to enroll him at a local elementary school (Shim Seok Elementary School; 심석초등학교) as a sixth grader. While Song did not perform well, obtaining a score of 12% on his math exam, his parents maintained that Song was neither used to, or interested in, calculating equations that lacked meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="공부에 빠진 유근이 배울 곳이 없었다" : 주간동아|url = http://weekly.donga.com/List/3/all/11/77317/1|website = weekly.donga.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the school allowed this at first, it later reversed its decision, citing administrative difficulties. Song's parents took the elementary school to court, where the court ruled that the school's decision was unlawful in April 2005, allowing Song to study there as a sixth grader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 진학시기 놓친 '일곱살 영재'|url = http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=2005041896698&amp;sid=01062004&amp;nid=910|website = www.hankyung.com|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Korean students must enroll in middle school within 30 days of the beginning of the school year, Song could not enroll in middle school even after winning the lawsuit. Song's parents decided to opt for a Korean equivalent of the [[General Educational Development|GED]]. Song passed the test, which gave him the right to enroll in high school in May 2005. He then went on to pass the test that certified him as a high school graduate in August 2005. Thus, Song finished the twelve-year curriculum spanning elementary school – middle school – high school in nine months, setting a new record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 9세 대학생? 8세 신동 송유근군 고졸검정고시 합격 : 뉴스 : 동아닷컴|url = http://news.donga.com/3/all/20050825/8222190/1|website = news.donga.com|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, he applied and was accepted to [[Inha University]] through its early decision plans, which allows exceptional students to bypass the Korean equivalent of [[SAT]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s at age 7, being the youngest [[university]] student ever. During his interview with [[Inha University]], Song demonstrated his understanding of the [[Schrödinger equation]], a [[partial differential equation]] which is of central importance to [[quantum mechanics]] theory. Considering his young age, Inha University formed a committee of seven, named "Song Yoo-Geun Committee," including professors and his mother, who gave him private lessons instead of the usual classroom style lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ‘천재소년’ 인하대 송유근군의 최근 생활은？ – Sciencetimes|url = http://www.sciencetimes.co.kr/?news=%25EC%25B2%259C%25EC%259E%25AC%25EC%2586%258C%25EB%2585%2584-%25EC%259D%25B8%25ED%2595%2598%25EB%258C%2580-%25EC%2586%25A1%25EC%259C%25A0%25EA%25B7%25BC%25EA%25B5%25B0%25EC%259D%2598-%25EC%25B5%259C%25EA%25B7%25BC-%25EC%2583%259D%25ED%2599%259C%25EC%259D%2580%25EF%25BC%259F|website = www.sciencetimes.co.kr|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inha University also provided Song with his own lab, and a residence space, so that he can stay with his parents, at his parents' request. His first semester [[GPA]] was 3.8/4.5,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 천재소년 송유근 1학기 성적 3.8 - 조선닷컴 인물|url = http://www.chosun.com/national/news/200608/200608220162.html|website = www.chosun.com|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately equivalent to a B+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ‘천재소년’ 송유근, 8살때 대학 입학 첫 학기 학점이 ‘B+’...못말리는 천재성|url = http://sports.khan.co.kr/news/sk_index.html?art_id=201511181737543&amp;sec_id=540201|website = sports.khan.co.kr|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, In December 2008, mere two years after he has begun his studies, he decided to withdraw from Inha University, since he felt "difficult to study within the framework that the professor has arbitrarily decided for themselves." He said, "I want to study string theory or big bang theory, but I cannot do that as an undergraduate student."Of the 140 credits required for graduation, Song received 53 credits from Inha University, and 113 credits from an on-line degree institution. On this, Inha University said, that it "respects Song's decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 인하대, 송유근군 대학원 진학 결정 존중|url = http://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1000516016|website = SBS NEWS|accessdate = 2015-12-06|language = ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;" To fulfill total credit hours to apply for a graduate school, he achieved [[Bachelor's degree]] using [http://www.cb.or.kr/creditbank/info/info7_1.do Credit Bank System].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=미디어다음 |title=`천재소년' 송유근 학점은행으로 학사모 | URL = http://media.daum.net/breakingnews/view.html?cateid=1067&amp;newsid=20090223162417627&amp;p=yonhap |accessdate=2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Korea University of Science and Technology|University of Science &amp; Technology]] (UST) as a master's student&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = '천재소년' 송유근 UST 석사과정 입학|url = http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/02/25/2009022501597.html|website = news.chosun.com|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in February 2009, with the intention of studying astronomy. Like Inha University, UST formed a committee of professors, titled "Song Yoo-Geun Project," and Song was given private lessons in lieu of classroom lectures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = ‘13세’ 송유근 군 UST 석박사 통합과정 합격   {{!}} 동아사이언스|url = http://www.dongascience.com/news/view/-387254/bef|website = dongascience.com|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topics of the lectures varied from [[quantum field theory]], [[nuclear physics]], [[astronomy]], and [[topology]]. The university set aside 100 million Korean won (approximately $80,000 USD) for Song's classes and research. In February 2010, UST announced that Song was accepted to its combined master's and Ph.D. program,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with the goal of obtaining a Ph.D. in 2012.

He studied under the guidance of Dr. [[Park Seok-jae]], whose specialized area is [[black hole]] modeling. He passed his candidacy exam in November 2014, by a presentation entitled "Gromov-Witten Invariants on Real Hypersurfaces of Kähler Manifold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = '수학자로 진로 정해' '천재소년' 송유근 근황 - 케이신문 K신문|url = http://search.ksinmun.com/view/y/2014-11-21/51663.html|website = search.ksinmun.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208110244/http://search.ksinmun.com/view/y/2014-11-21/51663.html|archivedate = 2015-12-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;" and declared his intention to become a mathematician to the press. However, he again changed his mind to study [[black hole]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Controversy ==

=== Air Purification System Controversy ===
During a press conference in 2005, after he was admitted to Inha University, he brought a machine that purifies air, and gave a demonstration of it. The press and the Inha University officials reported that Song claimed it to be a machine that he invented himself, to thank the Korean citizens for their support, it became known later that the machine was in fact designed by a small company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 송유근군이 발명했다던 '공기 정화기' 알고보니 중소기업 제품|url = http://news.joins.com/article/1710137|website = news.joins.com|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to CEO of JC Technologies, Song's father told him that being able to show off the machine in front of the press will help with its sales, and he had borrowed it from the company. Song's father quickly admitted this misunderstanding, saying that "Song has ambitions to study air purification methods using photosynthesis, so he just did a demonstration. There may have been parts where we were misunderstood, as this was our first large-scale press conference."

=== Plagiarism Controversy ===
In 2015, ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]'' (ApJ) retracted Song's paper due to plagiarism issue. ApJ noticed that the paper plagiarized a 2002 book chapter,&lt;ref name="plagiarism1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plagiarism2"/&gt; which was originally a proceeding paper of Song's advisor, Dr. [[Park Seok-jae]].

{{Quote|text=Song &amp; Park (2015) draws extensively from an earlier publication by Dr. Park, "Stationary Versus Nonstationary Force-Free Black Hole Magnetospheres," in Black Hole Astrophysics 2002: Proceedings of the Sixth APCTP Winter School (World Scientific Publishing Co., 2002). In fact, the differences are modest, mostly confined to an alternate formulation of the analytic results, and could raise the question of copyright violation. Park (2002) is not part of the peer-reviewed literature, and scientists frequently use a conference proceeding as the rough draft of a subsequent submission to a professional peer-reviewed journal. However, in this case the overlap between the 2002 book chapter and 2015 paper is exceptionally large. |author=The American Astronomical Society |source=[https://aas.org/posts/news/2015/11/astrophysical-journal-paper-retracted-plagiarism Astrophysical Journal Paper Retracted for Plagiarism] }}

Dr. Park first denied the plagiarism controversy towards Song, insisting he will "resign his position if any part of his paper is found unoriginal."&lt;ref name="yh"&gt;[http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2015/11/20/0200000000AKR20151120109500063.HTML]&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that Song's work on partial differential equation is totally of Song's, which is worth to be a "meaningful contribution as a doctoral student."&lt;ref name="yh" /&gt; Against the argument that several parts of Song's paper is appeared to overlap Dr. Park's proceeding in 2002, Dr. Park said that the proceeding is conventionally not considered as an 'official' paper, so citing the proceeding paper is not a requirement nor an offence against academic integrity or research ethics{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

In November, UST finally decided to take a disciplinary action to Song, punishing him for an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ZDNet Korea |title=UST "송유근, 표절 유감…학칙에 따라 징계 진행" |URL= http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=001&amp;oid=092&amp;aid=0002087075 |accessdate=2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, UST officially announced that Song was disqualified in the final defense and he failed to have the Ph.D. degree.

[[File:NWFBTrainingBuses.png|thumb|300px|Two training buses of [[New World First Bus]] in [[Hong Kong]].]]
A '''training bus''' is a special kind of [[bus]] or [[coach (vehicle)|coach]] that is used by [[list of bus operating companies|bus operators]] for training the driving skills of bus drivers. It is also used to train the driving skill of a person who is learning to become a bus driver. Driving a training bus on the road is an important part of driving training, as it is the most practical to train one's driving skill.

A training bus is usually a bus that has been retired from the passenger-serving fleet. Some bus companies may like to repaint the bus with a special livery for training bus after the bus is retired from the passenger-serving fleet, which is usually white or a plainer version of the company's regular livery. Some bus companies may also remove most of the facilities (such as passenger seats) from a training bus, so that those facilities can be installed onto some newer buses. On a training bus, there is usually another seat for the [[driving instructor]] (trainer) next to the driver's seat. This allows the instructor to monitor how trainee is driving and give appropriate instruction when necessary.

==Hong Kong==
The use of training buses for practical training is especially popular among the [[:Category:Bus companies of Hong Kong|Hong Kong franchised bus companies]]. In [[Hong Kong]], training buses are known in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as "訓練巴士" ([[pinyin]]: Xùn liàn bā Shì). Training buses used in Hong Kong, such as those used at [[Kowloon Motor Bus]], are typically buses that are older buses and retired from its main bus fleet, therefore only used for training purposes and not for passenger services.  However, for route training and other service or safety improvement trainings, in-service buses may be used.

==Other places==
In contrast, other jurisdictions may use active-service buses for training; this will be at non-peak service times when more buses are available. The head sign may be set to read 'TRAINING', and a sign mounted at the rear as well.

===Toronto===
The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] uses training buses on regular routes or roads with sign display the bus as a training bus for real life training for new drivers. The bus will not be in service and will only stop briefly at select bus stops.

[[File:Students work on robots at Cañada College.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Students working on a project.|Community college students are being increasingly sought after by many colleges, particularly if they earn an [[Associate Degree]], get high grades, and coordinate with counselors at their community college as well as Transfer Coordinators at their target school.]]
{{Education in the U.S.}}
'''Transfer admissions in the United States''' refers to college students changing universities during their college years. While estimates of transfer activity vary considerably, the consensus view is that it is substantial and increasing,&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311c/&gt; although media coverage of student transfers is generally less than coverage of the high school to college transition. A common transfer path is students moving from two-year community colleges to four-year institutions, although there is also considerable movement between four-year institutions. Reasons for transferring include unhappiness with campus life, cost, and course and degree selection.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311d/&gt; There are no standardized rules nationwide for transfers, and requirements vary by college.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S312/&gt; However, many states have taken steps to make the transition easier and less problematic, particularly from community colleges to four-year schools within the state, by various methods including school-to-school credit arrangements called [[Articulation (education)|articulation agreement]]s. While many state universities are constrained by budget cuts which have sometimes lessened the number of spots open to transfer students, there are reports that many private colleges are becoming more assertive in seeking transfer applicants.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311c&gt;{{cite news

 |title= Transfers a hot commodity for colleges

 |accessdate= May 18, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the transfer process can be difficult, such that transfer applicants have been described as collegiate "academic nomads"&lt;ref name=twsMay2S411/&gt; who face various obstacles trying to make sure their credits transfer properly to their new school. Unlike admission from high school directly to college, there is less data nationwide about transfer admissions, although there are signs that this is changing.

Advisors agree that much of the advice applicable to high school applicants to college is the same for transfer applicants, such as the need for [[College tour|visiting schools]] and trying to find one which is the "right fit".&lt;ref name=twsMay2S312/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMay2S115/&gt; The admissions process for transfer students is somewhat different from that for high school seniors. Transfer applicants are more often evaluated by college grades, with standardized test results being less important. The statistical chance of being accepted into a college by a transfer arrangement was 64%, a figure slightly lower than the acceptance rate for first-year college students of 69%.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt; Transferring into elite and highly selective schools is still quite difficult.

==Overview==

===Transfer pathways===
The most common transfer pathway is from two-year community colleges to four-year colleges within a state. Students beginning their collegiate education at community colleges save "enormously" on tuition,&lt;ref name=twsMay2S315&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; since most live with their parents and many work full-time.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S114/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; And many students switch between four-year colleges. Some students find themselves unhappy with their current college, and decide to switch for a variety of reasons, usually having to do with a program of study or a feeling about a particular school that the "fit" is not right, or concerns over cost.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S115&gt;{{cite news

===Demographics of transfer students===
Estimates vary considerably regarding how many college students transfer. Several reports suggested about a third of college-aged students had transferred at least once during their college careers,&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311d/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes transfers from community or two-year colleges to four-year colleges, as well as transfers between four-year colleges or universities.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt; A high estimate was that 60% of students attended more than one collegiate institution between the ages of 18 and 24, and this estimate includes 20% who transferred from one four-year institution to another one.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311c/&gt; A third estimate was that only 20% of students in four-year colleges were transfer students.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S112/&gt; A fourth estimate, from the National Center of Education Statistics, was that 2.5 million college students transferred each year.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S115/&gt; In 2009, one report was that 566,400 students at schools surveyed by ''[[US News]]'', transferred from one institution to another in that year.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311e&gt;{{cite news

 |title= 10 Colleges With Most Transfer Students

 |accessdate= May 18, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report in 1999–2000 suggested that a fifth of community college students intended to transfer to four-year colleges, and an additional 24% were taking courses for personal enrichment or for transfer purposes.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S315/&gt; Another report suggested that only about a quarter of community college students followed through on their plan to transfer to a four-year college or university.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S411/&gt;

Transfer students tend to be disproportionately from poorer families, according to one report.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S112/&gt; A report suggests that many transfer students have "far more experience in the ups and downs of the working world" and tend to bring more diversity to a college campus.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S114/&gt; A second report confirms that "transfers graduate at a higher rate than students who just finished 12th grade", and have "adjusted to a more independent lifestyle."&lt;ref name=twsMay2S211/&gt; Demographic analysis suggests that a slight decline in high school graduates is underway since about 2009, prompting many four-year colleges to make up for the shortfall by bringing in more transfer students.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S411/&gt;

===Financial considerations for transfer students===
Transfer students can get financial assistance in the form of merit aid. One estimate was that over three-quarters of colleges (77%) offer merit aid to transfer applicants. Merit aid often varies by college size: smaller colleges with less than 3,000 students were somewhat more likely to offer merit aid (81%) than medium-sized colleges (66%) or large schools (67%).&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt; Greater than three-quarters of schools (77%) said that they offer merit scholarships for transfer students.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt; And there are reports that the practice of offering "transfer scholarships" is becoming more prominent.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311c/&gt; There are reports that there is more [[Student financial aid in the United States|financial aid]] for transfer students in states such as [[New Jersey]], which have increased state funds for scholarships such as the [[Higher education in New Jersey#NJ STARS|NJ STARS II]] program.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S211/&gt; There was a report that less selective colleges and universities were somewhat less likely than competitive colleges to award merit scholarships to incoming transfer students.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt;

==The process of transferring==

===Obstacles and difficulties===
One reporter described the transfer process as problematic:

{{Quote|The trouble can begin during the clunky and overly complicated transfer admissions process. While students who come from community colleges are often assisted by long-standing agreements between a state's junior colleges and its flagship universities, the path for everyone else—those who are crossing state lines, who come from another four-year university, or who have spent years in the workforce—is far more treacherous. The process is difficult to navigate without the help of counselors and advisers, positions that often are left unfilled when budget cuts need to be made.|Alison Go in ''[[US News]]'', 2008&lt;ref name=twsMay2S112/&gt;}}

Openings for transfers vary by type of college, and can vary at a particular college year by year. One source suggested that small liberal arts colleges which have most freshmen completing all four years, tend to have few openings available; in contrast, large state universities often have many positions open, typically to accommodate graduates from two-year colleges.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt; For example, 412 students applied for transfer admission into [[Amherst College]] and admitted about 6% of them;&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt; in contrast, the much larger [[Arizona State University]] had 11,427 transfer applicants and admitted 84% of them. One report described transfer students as "academic nomads" struggling to keep credit hours they have earned.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S411&gt;{{cite news

Transfer students, particularly community college students, face many additional obstacles when trying to achieve their transfer goals. While attending a community college is a financially attractive choice to numerous students in the United States, studies have shown that students who enroll in community colleges are significantly less likely to complete a bachelor’s degree when compared to four-year students who started at a university as freshmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alfonso|first=Mariana|title=The Impact of Community College Attendance on Baccalaureate Attainment|journal=Research in Higher Education|date=December 2006|volume=47|issue=8|pages=873–903|doi=10.1007/s11162-006-9019-2|jstor=40197515}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is estimated that only 20% of the 1992 high school class originally enrolled at a community college received a bachelor’s degree by the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alfonso|first=Mariana|title=The Impact of Community College Attendance on Baccalaureate Attainment|journal=Research in Higher Education|date=December 2006|volume=47|issue=8|pages=873–903|jstor=40197515|doi=10.1007/s11162-006-9019-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who have a strong sense of self-efficacy, and feeling of belonging to the campus community, are more likely to persist in their studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tinto|first=Vincent|date=2015|title=Through the Eyes of Students|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286637525_Through_the_Eyes_of_Students|journal=Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory &amp; Practice|volume=19|pages=254-269|doi=10.1177/1521025115621917|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, transfer students' confidence can be hindered by the stigma associated with having attended community college, which is perceived to be less academically rigorous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chin-Newman|first=Christina|last2=Shaw|first2=Stacy|date=2013|title=The anxiety of change: How transfer students face challenges|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262377028_The_anxiety_of_change_How_transfer_students_face_challenges|journal=Journal of College Admission|volume=221|pages=15–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor preventing transfer out of community colleges is the requirement of remedial courses for new students. The large need for remedial classes, especially in writing and math, has left students discouraged, as they feel they are repeating high school.&lt;ref group=laird&gt;{{cite news|last=Laird|first=Bob|title=The Trouble With Transferring: It Shouldn't Be So Difficult|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA196376936&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=saddleback_col&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w|accessdate=29 July 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the lack of quality academic counseling has been a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gard|first=Dwight|last2=Paton|first2=Valerie|last3=Gosselin|first3=Kevin|date=2012|title=Student Perceptions of Factors Contributing to Community College-to-University Transfer Success|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10668920903182666|journal=Community College Journal of Research and Practice|volume=36|pages=833-848|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that many community college students attend more than one college, proper advising has been hard to come by since each school has its each course numbering system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Laird|first=Bob|title=The Trouble With Transferring: It Shouldn't Be So Hard|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA196376936&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=saddleback_col&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w|accessdate=29 July 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a student wishes to transfer to an institution out of state, the process becomes even more complicated as there may be limited articulation agreements.

The obstacles preventing two-year college students from transferring and earning a bachelor's degree may also be related to motivational and psychological issues. While work, family, and financial issues are the common factors to blame for the decline in transfer rates from community college students, research has shown that motivation to learn and succeed can make a major impact on a student's future. After examining the results from National Longitudinal Surveys, it was discovered that students entering a community college who aimed during their last few years in high school to earn a B.A. or graduate degree yielded the highest transfer rates in 1972 and 1980, the two classes of the study.&lt;ref name=grubb&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grubb|first=W|title=The Decline of Community College Transfer Rates: Evidence from National Longitudinal Surveys|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|date=March–April 1991|volume=62|issue=2|page=204|doi=10.2307/1982145|jstor=1982145}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the transfer rates in this study declined, a correlation between positive educational aspirations and transfer success was noted. Additional studies have also examined the relationship of psychological and motivational factors with transfer rates. Students who have ambitious career goals are more likely to transfer, and students whose expectations don't exceed the two-year college level are less likely to transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Velez|first=William|author2=Rajshekhar G. Javalgi |title=Two-Year College to Four-Year College: The Likelihood of Transfer|journal=American Journal of Education|date=November 1987|volume=96|issue=1|page=89|doi=10.1086/443882|jstor=1085178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making significant progress and steps at a community college may also be a beneficial factor in maintaining motivation and overcoming the difficulties that transfer students face. Referring back to the results from the National Longitudinal Surveys, it was found that students who transferred without an Associate degree were less likely to complete a B.A. degree than those without one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grubb|first=W|title=The Decline of Community College Transfer Rates: Evidence from National Longitudinal Surveys|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|date=March–April 1991|volume=62|issue=2|page=208|doi=10.2307/1982145|jstor=1982145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Researching transfer options===
Only in the past decade has the federal government begun requiring colleges to post statistics about transfer students. As a result, there is not much readily-accessible information about historical trends about transfer students.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311c/&gt; The [[United States Department of Education]] did a tracking study in 2003 to analyze the progress of students who started at community colleges in that year, and found that of those planning to transfer to a four-year college, only 15% of them had actually done so within a three-year time interval.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S411/&gt; Record keeping and data about transfer admissions is not as complete as comparable data for freshman admissions; it varies by school. Researching transfer possibilities is generally more complex than applying to college from high school.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt; Advisors suggest one method to get information about specific schools is to search online and use the [[Common Data Set]]:

{{Quote|The Common Data Set is a document that four-year schools across the country complete that contains lots of information on such topics as admission criteria, freshman academic profile, campus safety and transfer admissions. You can often find a college's Common Data Set by Googling that term and the name of the institution.|Lynn O'Shaughnessy in ''[[US News]]'', 2010&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt;}}

So-called "transfer friendly" colleges which seek transfer applicants often have a transfer coordinator, housing arrangements for transfer students, an orientation program for transfer students, and are likely to accept most or all of a student's credits from their previous college.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt;

===Transferring credits===
Generally in the past, the uncertainty surrounding the issue of credit transfers has been a continuing headache for transfer applicants. An applicant might find out, belatedly, that coursework taken at one school would not be accepted at a second school. A general issue with transferring colleges is getting the new college to accept the coursework from the old one. Students often speak with the target college's transfer credit evaluator to get a sense of which credits will be accepted.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt; In past years, the willingness of target colleges to approve credits was described as a "thorny proposition".&lt;ref name=twsMay2S211/&gt; The issue of transferring credits could be further complicated if an incoming school decided that a specific grade in the former school was insufficient for credit or if a transfer student decided to switch majors. There have been stories of students who arrived on campus with worthless transcripts:

{{Quote|There's nothing more frustrating for a transfer student than to sit down with a four-year school and realize they wasted two years because they didn't take the right classes.|Alan Byrd, admissions director at [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]], 2012&lt;ref name=twsMay2S411/&gt;}}

A reporter explained that community colleges do not have articulation agreements with every possible target school, and that course catalogs can not provide information about which courses will be accepted at which colleges:

{{Quote|Course catalogs offer little or no guidance to students, why one class might transfer and the other won't. But that's because each four-year school may treat a particular class differently. The University of Missouri might accept an English course rejected by the University of Kansas. There can even be differences within a campus, with a science course counting toward a general education degree but failing to satisfy a school's nursing program. As a result, it's not always clear whether a course will be accepted when a student decides to transfer.|Reporter Tim Barker in ''St. Louis Today'', 2012&lt;ref name=twsMay2S411/&gt;}}

Despite past difficulties with transferring credits, there are numerous reports that colleges are seeking more transfer applicants. To expedite this process, many colleges are taking steps to streamline the credit-approval process&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311c/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMay2S412&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are being more open-minded about accepting credits. Some colleges have "one-stop transfer centers" to make final determinations about which course credits will transfer.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311c/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMay2S211/&gt; The [[American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers]] oversees colleges and universities and determines such matters as college accreditation, and as a result, most four-year colleges accept credits from colleges that this body approves provided that the student has earned a grade of "C" or higher in those courses.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S315/&gt; One advisor suggested that students should "get in touch with their target schools as early as possible to make sure their course plan will work."&lt;ref name=twsMay2S411/&gt; Another successful transfer strategy is for students to complete their [[Associate Degree]] which, according to one report, will "essentially guarantee that all of their credits will transfer."&lt;ref name=twsMay2S411/&gt;

===Statistics on acceptances===
Statistics regarding transfer admissions are becoming easier to obtain since most schools follow the [[Common Data Set]] format and post information on numerous variables on a website. However, formats vary: some schools use a spreadsheet while others use a pdf. And in some cases, the common data set information is hard to find on a college's website, or buried in a "Fast Facts" section. The data in the adjacent table is for selected colleges for the 2010–2011 year. It is average data only, and may change substantially from year to year, and from college to college. Click on the triangles to sort columns by school name, state, number of applicants, and percent acceptances.&lt;ref&gt;Note: many colleges had not yet posted the 2011-2012 data at the time of this chart. If contributors wish to add data for other colleges, please do so.&lt;/ref&gt;

Admissions departments, when evaluating transfer applicants, weigh the student's grade point average at their current college to a considerable extent; it is usually the single most important factor overall.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt; One estimate was that 90% of colleges surveyed felt that the college grade point average was "considerably important."&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt; A second source confirms that post-secondary grade point average is the "most important factor for transfer admission."&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt; Other factors entering into transfer evaluations may include high school grade point average (56% of colleges consider this), recommendations and quality of current college or university programs (48%), essays or writing samples (47%), and scores on standardized tests (42%).&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt; As a rule of thumb, the more time that a student has spent with his or her current college, the less another school will be interested in standardized tests taken during high school such as the [[ACT (test)|ACT test]] or [[SAT|SAT test]]. A student who has completed two-years at a community college and earned an [[Associate Degree]] often will not be asked to supply a high school record or ACT/SAT scores unless he or she earned less than 30 credits.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S312/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt; About a tenth of colleges (11%) consider it a negative if the transfer applicant planned to only attend the new school "part-time".&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt;

Transfer students are usually asked to explain why they would like to transfer, particularly when changing from one four-year college to another. One report advised applicants to avoid saying anything negative about their current school but rather to focus on specific reasons for the change.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311a/&gt;

Admissions consultants Howard and Matthew Greene suggested that students should contact target schools early:

{{Quote|... if you have particular universities in mind as targets, start contacting them early to know their time schedule and particular requirements in the first two years of their program so that you can try to match up your curriculum. Be certain of specific requirements for any special school programs (business, communications, fine arts, engineering, etc.). The transfer process is typically more mature and directed, and students should have a better sense of their interests, majors, and what they're looking for. Colleges expect direct contacts from students as mature learners.|Howard and Matthew Greene, 2003&lt;ref name=twsMay2S213/&gt;}}

===Adjusting to a new school===
[[File:RutgersHall1462.JPG|thumb|right|300px|alt=Buildings behind trees.|[[Rutgers University]] in New Jersey has a one-credit required "course" to teach incoming transfer students about the particulars of campus life at the public university.]]

Transfer applicants sometimes have difficulty adjusting to a new school. Unlike four-year students, they often have to get acclimated to the institution at a time when they are expected to make decisions about majors and courses of study, and often have to learn new procedures and routines.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311d/&gt; In addition to reduced housing options, other difficulties encountered include often having to register for courses after four-year students, so many courses are filled up before a transfer student has a chance to sign up for them.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311d/&gt; Some universities such as [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]] have a required one-credit seminar "course" to teach incoming transfer students about university life, including topics ranging from football games to art museums, and has 25 "transfer mentor" students to help them adjust to campus life.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S211/&gt;

==Transferring to different types of schools==

===Transferring to a private college===
There are reports of private colleges making more active efforts to woo community college students as an effort to "bolster and diversify their enrollments".&lt;ref name=twsMay2S113&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= May 19, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private college admissions departments are more likely to evaluate transfer applicants based on nonacademic variables such as the interview, recommendations, writing samples, and the quality of the applicant's current college.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt; One estimate was that 40% of these schools recalculate a transfer applicant's GPA as part of the evaluation process,&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt; by using algorithms to factor in perceived course difficulty and comprehensiveness. One report suggested that private schools, while they tend to be more expensive, were a "strong option for transfer students" since they were often unaffected by state budget cuts and tend to have "better counseling services."&lt;ref name=twsMay2S112/&gt; Private colleges often view applicants from community colleges positively since many have had a track record of finishing their four-year degrees, or what colleges term "high persistence", and being successful students with relatively high graduation rates.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S113/&gt; There are reports that the percentage of community college students who are transferring to private schools is increasing; in the past, the percentage was about 15% to 20%, but the figure is more likely to be higher in recent years.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S113/&gt;

There tend to be more transfers to large private institutions, such as [[DePaul University]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] which accepted 1,400 transfer students in 2009, mostly from community colleges.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S115/&gt; In New Jersey, [[Seton Hall University]] keeps track of high school students which it accepts but who then decide to enroll in a community college, and then it sends them letters and emails after a year to try to get them to transfer; in addition, Seton Hall purchases lists of students from [[Phi Theta Kappa]], the two-year college honor society.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S211/&gt;

===Transferring to a public university===
[[File:OCC3-NJ.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Building in winter.|Community colleges such as [[Ocean County College]] in [[New Jersey]] often have clearly specified transfer pathways to four-year colleges within the state.]]

This is the most likely pathway for students transferring from community colleges, usually to a four-year public university within their state. About half of public universities recalculate a transfer applicant's GPA when deciding whether to admit the student.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt; Often large public universities are well-suited to absorb many transfer applicants.

[[File:Gville UF old Dairy Sci bldg front01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Picture of building behind palm trees.|Budget cuts at the [[University of Florida]] have left fewer spots open for transfer students.]]
[[File:USC Bovard Auditorium.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Building.|Well-endowed large private universities such as the [[University of Southern California]] have ramped up efforts to attract transfer students, according to one report.]]

However, there are numerous reports from states about constraints placed on incoming transfers because of budget cuts, although the general pattern is that states are working harder to ensure a smoother transition, with transfers of credit, from community colleges to four-year flagship schools. In [[Virginia]], the [[University of Virginia]], which has approximately 14,000 undergraduate students, had 2,434 transfer applications in 2008, and of these, admitted 958, an acceptance rate of 39%.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt; In 2008 in [[Florida]], the [[University of Florida]] announced reductions in its transfer class by 33% to cope with budget shortfalls.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S112&gt;{{cite news

{{Quote|It helps the selective privates with their diversity, in terms of race and socioeconomic status ... To get students in certain income brackets, it matters. Oftentimes it's easier to recruit at community colleges than at challenged high schools. For those who value diversity, whether it's because of the college rankings or their mission, this is where you go.|Sociologist Josipa Roksa of the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref name=twsMay2S113/&gt;}}

===Transferring to an elite university===
[[File:Amherst College College Row.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Building.|[[Amherst College]] accepts very few transfer applicants.]]

A general picture is that elite colleges and universities accept very few transfer applications and are "extremely picky", generally because most of their enrolled students continue through all four years without changing to another school or dropping out, and there are few empty slots to fill. For example, [[Yale University]] had 751 transfer applications in 2008, and accepted only 24 of these.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt; [[Harvard University]] has not accepted any transfer students in the last few years; [[Columbia University|Columbia]] accepted only 8% in 2007, and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] accepted only 16% in 2008.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311d/&gt; These schools are more likely to consider such factors as the quality of the applicant's high school and current college, as well as factors such as the applicant's state and county of residence, race and ethnicity, and alumni relations.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311b/&gt; One report suggested the essay was highly important, and that an applicant should explain why they wished to change schools.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311d/&gt; Generally, elite schools do not look favorably on students who try to "trade up" to a more "prestigious bumper sticker."&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311d/&gt; Successful transfers into elite schools have "great grades and test scores,"&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311d/&gt; and students usually transfer from other elite schools. Some top schools such as [[Cornell University]] have articulation agreements specifying how a community college student can transfer into Cornell by taking specific courses and getting good grades in them.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311d/&gt;

===Transferring within a state===
The consensus view is that transferring from a two-year college to a four-year college—within one state—is smoother than transfers from one state to another.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S112/&gt; Since community and two-year college programs are often supported by government subsidies at the county or state level, and lawmakers strive to increase educational opportunities for students within their state, there have been many efforts by state legislatures and administrators in flagship universities to facilitate the switch-over from two-year to four-year colleges within each state. In addition, many state colleges standardize their requirements for incoming transfer students, which helps to expedite intrastate transfers. For example, the [[California State University]] system gives priority to community college students transferring to four-year colleges within California; one estimate was that 60% of students on its 23 different campuses were transfer students.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R311e/&gt; The [[University of California]] has an arrangement to accept many students conditionally to one of its 10 undergraduate campuses if students first complete two years of community college; the plan extended these so-called "provisional offers of admission" to 12,700 students in the year 2000 (before the [[University of California, Merced|tenth campus]] opened).&lt;ref name=twsMay2S212&gt;{{cite news

'''Trinity University College''' ({{lang-cy|Coleg Prifysgol y Drindod}}) was a Church University College in [[Carmarthen]], Wales. In 2010, it merged with the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]] to become the new [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David]].

The institution was founded in 1848 as the South Wales and Monmouthshire Training College.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==
Trinity University College began life in 1848 as the South Wales and [[Monmouthshire]] Training College, making it the oldest teacher training college in continuous operation in Wales. The college's role was to train young men for teaching in Church primary schools. In the first year of operation, 22 students were recruited and were taught by three members of staff including the first Principal, William Reed. Walter Powell is recorded as the first student; he was 17, previously a draper and worked in a grocery store. The College required its students to follow a strict schedule which included getting up at half past six for a cold bath. Students were often recruited from humble backgrounds, and to remind them of this, the college curriculum included subjects such as gardening and woodwork. The students were expected to have a knowledge of grammar and arithmetic and received education in Latin and Greek. By 1936, the college also had an art block and a gym. The college also placed restrictions on the interaction with the local town, particularly with women and fines were issued for 'girling' (interaction with local women). The strict regime of college life was however broken for activities such as smoking and reading newspapers in the common rooms, musical concerts and entertainment. In the late [[Victorian era]], photography became a great hobby at the college. In the inter-war era, the college gained a reputation for sports (which still exists to this day). The sports practised at the college included, [[badminton]], [[tennis]] and [[hockey]]. The main sport however was rugby, which has a strong tradition at Trinity and many past students have gone on to become great successes in the sport.

An account of college life in the 1930s is provided by ex-student George Head, who wrote that the Old Building and the Dewi Hostel combined contained all of the teaching rooms, a gymnasium, the library, the smoking room and common rooms, the secretary offices and the 'Sick Ward' and medical facilities. Church was still at this period a large part of the college life. Interaction with women was still forbidden and punishable. Head does however speak of how fond the students were of the college and how much they took away from it. In particular he recounts the old Trinity College Anthem called ''There is a tavern in the town''

During the [[Second World War]] many students were expected to take 'fire watches' and serve as lookouts at night, although this job came with little danger in a town like Carmarthen. Many of the students at the college also joined the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] and took part in drills. In 1938 a Broadcast room was constructed, the foundation stone being laid by the Duke of Kent.

In 1931, the College changed its name to ''Trinity College, Carmarthen''. Female students were first admitted in 1957 and in 2009, the College achieved "[[university college]]" status, changing its name to Trinity University College.

===College anthem===
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;There is a tavern in the town, in the town
And there my true love settled down, settled down
She read her books so merrily
And never, never thought of me, thought of me.

And we saddened as the days drew near to part, to part
We do, O Trinity, we do, we do, we do
Regard thee with affection true, affection true
I'll hang my hat on the Old Oak Tree,
And may the world go well with thee, well with thee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/alumni/trinitycollegealumni/history/yourmemories/mrgeorgeheadmbe/|title=University of Wales Trinity Saint David – Error 404: Page not found|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[Image:Trinity College, Carmarthen Wales.jpg|thumb|left|Trinity College, Carmarthen]]

==Location==
Trinity College is situated on the outskirts of Carmarthen. It is in a rural setting, surrounded by fields and hills, but is within 10 minutes walk of the town centre. The University is situated around the original 'Old College' of 1848 and is a mixture of lawns and gardens surrounding modern buildings. The main bulk of the university lies at along College Road and Job's Well Road, with some buildings situated away from the main grounds. On the outskirts of the town, near the town leisure centre there is the university's outdoor weather pitch. These facilities were inherited by the new university and continue in use today.

==Buildings==

===Original buildings===

====Old Building====
The campus is centred on the original 1848 'Old Building' of Trinity College. It originally contained all of the original dormitories, common rooms, libraries, an original university quadrangle and teaching spaces. The building today houses several lecture theatres and smaller classrooms often used by the University's school of Justice and Social Inclusion (including Psychology) and, Theology, Religious Studies and Islamic Studies.

[[File:Picture of Old Building Carmarthen.jpg|thumb|Picture of Old Building Carmarthen]]

Another feature of the old building of Carmarthen is the Archbishop Childs' hall. Named after [[Derrick Greenslade Childs]], who was [[Archbishop of Wales]], [[Bishop of Monmouth]] and director of the [[Church in Wales]]. Childs was principal of Trinity from 1965 and died in 1987 shortly after his retirement. The hall is of a classical shape and is hung with framed paintings of Childs. The hall is today used as a venue for conferences, lectures and performances (it contains a grand piano). On the outside of the building, there is a carved crest of the Bishops of Wales. The name of Childs is also given to an upper room in the old building named 'Archbishop Childs room'

====Cwad====
The original 1848 quadrangle has been modified and renamed the "Cwad". This comprises a collection of computer suites and study rooms as well as a coffee shop located in the "old Library" which serves Starbucks coffee and small meals. This area is also home to the University shop which sells daily essentials for learning.

====Chapel====
[[File:Chapel at Trinity University College Carmarthen.JPG|thumb|Trinity University College Carmarthen, Chapel building exterior]]

Attached to the main body of the building is the University Chapel. This space is divided into 3 areas; the main chapel, the ante-chapel and the chaplaincy lounge. The Main chapel is an extension added in 1932, it retains many of its original features such as a large pipe organ and several stained glass features. The ante-chapel is the original 1848 chapel, now dedicated to past students and lecturers who served during the [[First World War]]. It has a central font and is decorated with student artwork. Connected to this is the Chaplaincy lounge. This space serves as a comfortable relaxed meeting space for students. It also houses the chaplaincy library, a small collection of literature serving needs of the chapel and its congregation.

===Later additions===

====Halliwell Centre====
The Halliwell Centre was the College's main conference facility. It is named after Rev. Dr. [[Thomas Halliwell]] LL.D. M.A., a former lecturer and principal of the college. The building comprised several large lecture halls, smaller conference rooms and suites, a larger conference hall complete with bar facilities and the Halliwell Theatre, which regularly hosted shows by travelling companies and the universities acclaimed performing arts students. The facilities of the Halliwell were often used by the various schools of the college for lectures and larger seminars. Beneath the main complex were also several more lecture rooms and the drama department.

The Halliwell Centre also housed the [[Merlin]] restaurant, which was the main refectory for catered students.

====Carwyn James Building====
This building was named after [[Carwyn James]], a rugby player and former lecturer of the college. This facility was home to the Faculty of Education and Training. It was used to teach degrees such as primary education and its interior was designed to resemble that of a school building. On the second floor of the building, overlooking the [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] was the college's 'Quiet Study Facility' which allowed students a comfortable space to work in peace.

====Emyr Wyn Jones Building====
This building housed office space, music suites and practice rooms for the School of Performing Arts. Adjoining this building was the School's main workshop for the degree of theatre production and design.

====Dewi Building====
The Dewi building was originally built in 1925 as the Dewi Hostel. It was an extension of the original old college and served as an extra wing for student accommodation. An account of the conditions of the hostel survives from a student living in them at the time; "To keep oneself warm in the new wing during the Winter months was a problem for although it had a system of heating, the heat seldom reached even the second floor. To wash we depended on the rain-water caught in the roof of the building and this was always cold". In 2010 the building was entirely refurbished primarily as office space into a modern building. It contained the university's main reception, finance office and registry as well as IT facilities which were sometimes used by the School of Business and Tourism.

====Students' Union====
The Students' Union building was the centre of student social life on the campus. Constructed in 1972 it comprised two main venues: the Attic Bar which served food and drinks and downstairs 'Unity', the main entertainment venue of the Union. This facility hosted club nights as well as other social events. The Union incorporated many societies, ranging from sports such as rugby and hockey to historical societies.

====Learning Resources Centre====
The main library of the university Campus was constructed in 1995 to accommodate the growing diversity of subjects on the campus and was located opposite the Parry Block. It was dedicated to the poet [[Raymond Garlick]], who was a principal lecturer in Trinity's Welsh Department. It contained a total of 110,000 books along with academic journals and DVDs. It also housed public computers, printing and photocopying facilities. The first floor contained the bulk of the main collection as well as specialist collections, IT spaces and larger collections. The second floor contained quieter working spaces and the rest of the main collection.

====Parry Block====
Named after Canon Parry, a former head of the college, the Parry Block contained a variety of teaching facilities which were used largely by the University's School of Justice and Social inclusion and School of Creative Arts. These included large classrooms and smaller art studios.

====Norah Isaac====
Named after [[Norah Isaac]], a former lecturer and important figure in Welsh drama, this building had a selection of classrooms and lecture suites. Degrees in English and Creative Writing were also taught in this building. It was located directly opposite the Parry Building.

====Robert Hunter====
Named after Robert Hunter, this building contained laboratories, classrooms and lecture halls used by the School of Sport, Health and Outdoor Education. The facility was located near the Myrddin Accommodation blocks, and was surrounded by picturesque gardens and ponds.

====Dafydd Rowlands====
Named after the author [[Dafydd Rowlands]], this building was the hub of the School of Film and Visual Media. It was used by many of the creative arts degrees and contained lecture rooms, crafting spaces and an office space for the School of Visual Media.

==Student life==

===Student Union===
The students' union building at the college was constructed in 1972 for the purposes of serving the growing number of students deciding to live on campus. It was a large building, complete with a club called Unity and the Attic Bar. Trinity had several sporting and academic societies and clubs run by the union. The university college also had a Christian Union and Amnesty groups.

==Accommodation==
[[Image:Arch Bishop Noakes Student accommodation.jpg|thumb|right|Archbishop Noakes Hall of Residence]]

* [[Archbishop Noakes]] Hall: this was a large accommodation facility that was split into three sections. It could house hundreds of students and was reserved for returning students. The Blocks were all self catered, each room is en-suite, and are divided into flats of eight with one kitchen per flat.
* [[Myrddin]] Hall: this was a catered first year hall, built in the late1960s to accommodate growing numbers of students. The Halls had shared common room space and shared bathrooms. 
* Non Hall: originally built in 1957 opposite the old Dewi Hostel to accommodate the first female students. The building had similar facilities to the Myrddin Halls. It remained a single-sex, female block up until the merger, and was reserved for first year catered students. 
* Tower Hall: this too was a first year catered block. It was 10 stories tall and could accommodate many students.
* Picton Hall: Situated on Picton Terrace by the junction with Picton Place, this was used during the 1990s as accommodation for male students. It comprised three Georgian houses, two of which were joined. Picton residents ate their meals on campus in the canteen. During the late 1990s the hall was unsupervised by a warden and was in poor repair. The buildings are no longer part of the University.

The college could accommodate 600 of its students, though many elected to live in private accommodation in town.

==Sports==
Trinity had a long history of sport and from its very beginnings sport played an important role in students' life. Rugby was an important and strong tradition at Trinity and many of its past Alumni went on to become very successful in the sport.

===Facilities===
Shortly before merger, the college had a fully equipped gymnasium and sports hall. It had a climbing wall, a swimming pool, tennis courts and an [[astroturf]]. As well as this the college had large playing fields and all-weather pitch near the town leisure centre. Sport was also studied academically through the Schools of Nutrition Health and Exercise and Sport, Health and Outdoor Education.

==Performing arts==
The campus' general workshop and costume workshops were used by students of theatre design. Venues for theatrical performances included a tiered theatre in the Halliwell Centre, a 160-seat facility with a sprung floor which could be used for dance rehearsals, Theatr Parry, and Theatr Fach (which contained a green screen and was used as a recording studio).

==Creative arts==
The college also housed workshops designed for different arts and crafts such as woodwork, fine art and ceramics. There were also modern media suites which allowed students to engage with 2D and 3D moving artwork and an Apple Mac lab equipped with dual core i-Macs, as well as Mac Pro towers to enable students to have an industry standard experience. In addition, the campus was home to the 'final cut' film studio and recording and editing studios used by Film and Media students.

==Courses==
Historically, Trinity College was primarily concerned with the discipline of teacher training. It had a long and constant history with the subject. This tradition continued throughout the institution's history and the college became one of the UK's chief providers of the subject.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} As it developed, Trinity College began to teach a wide range of subjects including:

* Business and Tourism,
* IT, Computer and Internet technology,
* Health Science, Nutritional science, and Sports Science,
* Social Inclusion and Justice,
* Psychology,
* Religious Studies, Theology and Islamic Studies,

* Physical Education, Outdoor Education,
* Art and Design,
* Film, Media and Photography,
* Childhood Studies,
* Archaeology,
* English and Creative Writing,
* Heavy Craft (Woodwork &amp; Metalwork),
* Mathematics.

After obtaining university status, the College also began awarding postgraduate degrees.

The '''National University of South''' (in Spanish: ''Universidad Nacional del Sur'', '''UNS''') is the largest [[national university]] in southern [[Argentina]]. Its motto is ''Ardua Veritatem'', which means "through the difficulties to the truth".

The university was founded on January 5, 1956, and absorbed what had been the '''Technological Institute of South''' (Instituto Tecnológico del Sur, ITS), a former [[National University of La Plata]] affiliate established in 1946. Located in the city of [[Bahía Blanca]], the school became the sixteenth in Argentina's national university system &lt;ref&gt;https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/latin-american-university-rankings/2016&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

The Instituto Tecnológico del Sur was created on October 9, 1946 by Provincial Act No. 5051, and it began its activities under the academic dependence on the National University of La Plata. In 1947, the Nation and the province Buenos Aires signed an agreement that stated that both of them would supply the funds for the operation and maintenance of the institute. On February 12, 1948, the incumbent president, [[Juan Domingo Perón]], appointed Dr. Miguel López Francés as President of the University, who was in charge of adopting the necessary measures for the organization thereof. The official inauguration ceremony of the ITS was held on February 20, 1948. The category of university was granted in 1950, however, it was cancelled in 1952, and it depended again on the Ministry of Economy of the Nation. The first graduate of the Institute was Engineer Nereo Roberto Parro, in 1953, who was a natural of the town of Tornquist. In 1955, after the fall of Perón's government, Professor Pedro González Prieto was appointed auditor of the institute, and proceedings before the national government began for the institute to become a national university. After the studies carried out by an advisor committee appointed by the Executive Power, the creation of the Universidad Nacional del Sur was approved by decree law No. 154, dated January 5, 1956.

==The Universidad Nacional del Sur==

In 1956 Professor Vicente Fatone was appointed Auditor President. Classes at the brand new institution began on April 1 of that same year. The UNS was the seventh national university created in the country, after the universities of Córdoba (1613), La Plata (1890), Tucumán (1912), Litoral (1919), and Cuyo (1939).

The new institution organized its academic structure into Departments, instead of the traditional Schools. Departments have a smaller administrative structure and allow for knowledge flexibility and inter-disciplinarity. Thus, academic units do not have to create for their careers those courses given at other departments, so that students can take them at the corresponding departments. The first Departments were Accountancy, Economics, Physics, Geology and Geography, Mathematics, Engineering, Humanities, and Chemistry.

After just a month of its opening, two students who had begun their careers at the Institute, Jorge Laurent and David Tomás Prieto, took the exams for the last courses, thus becoming the first graduates in the institution. The first woman to obtain her degree at the UNS was Betty Kerlleñevich, from Bahía Blanca, one of the founding students of the ITS, who also obtained a degree in engineering.

==Campus and facilities==

The main university complex is located at Alem 1253, where most of the Departments and laboratories operate as well as the Central Library. It is a large building that takes up more than a block and at the front there is a fountain with a sculpture by the artist Lola Mora. There are other buildings at the same premises:

At the intersection of 12 de Octubre and San Juan streets, are the buildings for the Departments of Humanities, Economics, Geography and Tourism, and Administration Sciences.

In the area known as "Altos del Palihue" there is another complex where the Departments of Agronomy and Law are located. There, the university has several acres of land, in which the Escuela de Agricultura y Ganadería "Ing. Agr. Adolfo J. Zabala" is also located.

The building located at Colon 80 originally corresponded to the headquarters of the Universidad Nacional del Sur. At present, the activities of the President's Office and its Secretariats are focused here, together with other administrative offices.

At Alem 925 is the "Casa de la Cultura", a colonial mansion that was formerly the center of an important villa. In this building, the General Secretariat of Communication and Culture organizes artistic and cultural activities. The University Foundation (FUNS) and Publishing House (EdiUNS) are also located there. In the buildings located at 11 de Abril 445 are the Escuela Superior de Comercio, Escuela de EGB (Initial Level, Levels 1, 2, and 3) and Escuela Normal Superior.

Currently, it includes sixteen departments: 
*[[Agronomy]]
*[[Biochemistry]]
*[[Biology]]
*[[Chemistry]]
*[[Computer science]]
*[[Economics]]
*[[Electrical engineering]]
*[[Engineering]]
*[[Geography]]
*[[Geology]]
*[[Humanities]]
*[[Law]]
*[[Management]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7085">A '''university college''' (Swedish: ''högskola''; Norwegian: ''høyskole'', ''høgskole'' or ''høgskule''; Danish: ''professionshøjskole''; literally meaning "high school" and "professional high school") in [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] is an independent institution that provides [[tertiary education]] (bachelor and master's degrees) and [[quaternary education]] (PhD). Most of these institutions traditionally had emphasis on less academic and more vocational programmes such as teacher or nursing education as well as shorter technical education; historically, these institutions were somewhat similar to a [[Fachhochschule]] in Germany and to a [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|Polytechnic]] in the United Kingdom. The term is also used for some specialized universities.

Today, the distinction between university colleges and universities is of less importance in Sweden and Norway. In Denmark university colleges grant non-academic degrees, but these may in some cases give access to further education at master level at a university.

==Situation in Scandinavia==

===Sweden===
The [[Swedish government]] is the only entity that can attribute university status.&lt;ref name="sweden"&gt;http://www.uka.se/fakta-om-hogskolan/universiteten-och-hogskolorna.html#h-Vadarskillnadenmellanuniversitetochhogskola&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact situation of Swedish university colleges varies in that respect, i.e. many them may are engaged in substantial research and grant doctoral degrees in a number of fields. The main difference between an institution with full university status and a university college lies in the larger variety of academic subjects offered at a university, and the traditional right of the university to award doctoral degrees in any field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.studyinsweden.se/Study-options/Basic-information/University-vs-university-college/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
In Norway three separate categories of university colleges exist:
*University-level colleges (''vitenskapelig høgskole/høyskole''), which hold the same rights as the universities and are sometimes known as specialized universities in English
*Institutionally accredited university colleges (''høgskole/høyskole'')
*Educational institutions with accredited programs, which have the right to call themselves university colleges (''høgskole/høyskole'')

The difference between a university and a university college is that a university has received the status of university from the Norwegian government. Only the government has the authority to grant university status. In the past years, any institution that offered at least four PhD programmes has been allowed apply for university status, and in recent years several university colleges have received university status, becoming so-called ''new universities''. In 2014 the government announced that no institutions would become new universities in the near future. In 2015 the government announced new and more strict criteria.

The practical distinction between universities and university colleges has been gradually reduced through legislative reforms in 1995 and 2005, and the two types of institutions are now governed by the same law, have the same basic structure and in principle the same obligation to provide research-based education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/debatt/article3682310.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
{{Main|University colleges in Denmark}}
In Denmark, university colleges (professionshøjskoler) are similar to universities of applied sciences. Danish university colleges offer profession specific tertiary education, also known as medium higher education (MVU) and diploma courses, but do not offer university education at postgraduate level.
 
The duration of bachelor’s programmes is seven semesters and corresponds to 210 ECTS. Specific to university college programmes is that curricula always include internships and placements. This focus on professional practice as opposed to academics is what separates a bachelor's degree at university colleges from a bachelor’s from a university.
 
The difference between a university and university college degree is narrowing. Since 2012, university colleges have been awarded the right and governmental funding to carry out applied research.
 
In addition, several bachelor's degrees are articulated with master's degrees at research universities in Denmark and abroad.
 
Denmark has 7 university colleges, which all have a school of health and a school of education, pedagogy, and social studies. Some also have a school of technology, a school of business, and a school of design.
 
In addition to higher educational programmes, university colleges are important suppliers of lifelong education for public and private industries.

==Translation==
University college is the most widely used official English translation in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, although some such institutions use the term [[university]] in English instead (for instance [[Malmö University]] and [[Södertörn University]]). The terminology may be confusing to foreigners as university colleges are not constituent ''colleges of another university'' as some may understand the word literally, but rather ''institutions in their own right and standing''.

The Swedish term ''högskola'' and the Norwegian term ''høyskole'', ''høgskole'' or ''høgskule'' would mean "high school" in a word-by-word translation. This translation is also misleading, as these institutions provide tertiary level education, not secondary education as American [[high school]]s do.

Some of these university colleges do aspire a lift to full university status by the Swedish or Norwegian government, and have therefore changed their translated English name to "university", although they are not a university by Swedish and Norwegian law. A full university in Sweden requires extensive own research, a breadth of academic disciplines and a licence to award doctor's degrees in all fields it teaches. In Norway, university status may be conferred to an institution offering at least four PhD programmes.

The term ''högskola'', ''høyskole'',''høgskole'' or ''høgskule'' is also used by a number of specialised universities, especially the technical universities. Some subunits of the universities in Sweden also use of the term "högskola" to mark their status within the larger university or for traditional reasons. For instance, several engineering faculties call themselves "teknisk högskola" in Swedish, like [[Lund Institute of Technology|Lunds Tekniska Högskola]] and [[Linköping Institute of Technology|Linköpings Tekniska Högskola]] which both were originally established independently of their respective universities.

The '''University of Pedagogical Sciences "Hector Alfredo Pineda Zaldivar" (UCPETP)''' ({{lang-es|Universidad de Ciencias Pedagógicas  [[Héctor Alfredo Pineda Zaldívar]]}}), originally named '''"Héctor Alfredo Pineda Zaldívar Higher Pedagogical Institute"''' ({{lang-es|Instituto Superior Pedagogico para la Ensenanza Tecnica y Profesional}}, '''ISPETP''') is a [[Higher Education]], post-graduate and doctoral research university located in [[Boyeros]], [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. It has the mission to prepare professors capable of developing high level professionals in different areas of engineering. It works to become the national leader of scientific and technical-pedagogical excellence for the improvement of the Technical and Professional Education and for its leading role of the technical careers in the rest of the pedagogical institutions.

== History==

The creation of the university has its origin in a project of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) requested by Cuban Government. It was originally named Higher Technical Pedagogical Institute of Technical Education (ISPET) and it was installed in the Center of Students of Agricultural Sciences (CEDCA), in the municipality of [[Boyeros]]. This project was included in the United Nations Development Program ([[PNUD]]) with the specification CUB 71-511. It began in the 1972-1973 academic year with an emerging training course. It is officially created in the course 1973-1974.

In the academic year 1976-1977 with the network of Pedagogical Institutes of the MINED, the center becomes the ISPETP and works with the Faculties of: Technology, Agricultural Sciences and Economic Sciences. The licentiate degree of all the specialties was imparted in the present Superior School of Management of the Industry Ministry and in some places of the Polytechnic "[[José Martí]]".

In 1979 the Faculty of Mechanics was approved. From 1986 the ISPETP was made with students graduated from the related specialties and is assigned the name of Héctor Alfredo Pineda Zaldívar, outstanding educator of the center that lost his life in the fulfillment of his professional duty.

In 1987, the creation of the Center's Scientific Council was approved. In 1991 arises the Center of Studies for Technical and Professional Pedagogy (CEPROF). From 1992-1993 the faculties merged in:

* Industrial Faculty.
* Faculty of Agricultural and Economic Sciences.

Due to the economic difficulties, faculties were created in Pedagogical Institutes in the rest of the country and the students were transferred to each of their provinces of origin.

The Institute now leads the Technical Education in the country, being responsible for the work of scientific and methodological advice. Today the institution carries out an intense academic work that extends in and out of our geographical borders, forming and training hundreds of professionals of the teaching in Professional Pedagogy.

==Organization==

At present, the faculties are arranged as follows:

* Faculty of [[Mechanical Engineering]]
* Faculty of [[Electrical Engineering]]
* Faculty of [[Accounting]]
* Faculty of [[Agricultural Engineering]]
* Faculty of [[Computer science|Computer Science]]s
* Faculty of [[Civil Engineering]]

==Names and confusion ==
This University of Pedagogical Sciences is named after one of its professors: Héctor Alfredo Pineda Zaldívar, who fell in unequal combat in the Zumbe region, in the People's Republic of Angola where he collaborated as a teacher. The person after whom ISPETP is named is unknown to the outside world.

It was originally named Higher Technical Pedagogical Institute of Technical Education (ISPET). In the academic year 1976-1977 the name changed to Instituto Superior Pedagogico para la Ensenanza Tecnica y Profesional "Hector Pineda Zaldivar" (ISPETP) to reflect the evolution from Technical to Technical and Professional education.

Sometimes, ISPETP is written as '''University of Pedagogical Sciences''' ({{lang-es|Universidad de Ciencias Pedagógicas}}) in some English literature, such as journals, etc. It is still known as ISPETP, due to the popularity and easy pronunciation of that short name.

Facebook, a [[social network service]], is increasingly being used by school administrations and [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] as a source of evidence against student users. The site, a popular online destination for college students, allows users to create profile pages with personal details. In the early years of the site, these pages could be viewed by other registered users from the same school, including [[resident assistant]]s, [[campus police]], or others who signed up for the service. The [[Privilege (computing)|user privileges]] and [[terms of service]] of the site have since been changed to allow users to control who has the ability to view their content.

Recent disciplinary actions against students based on information made available on Facebook has spurred debate over the legality and ethics of school administrators' harvesting such information. Facebook's [http://www.facebook.com/terms.php Terms of Use] specify that "the website is available for your personal, noncommercial use only," misleading some to believe that college administrators and police may not use the site for conducting investigations.  However, Facebook spokespeople have made clear that Facebook is a public forum and all information published on the site should be presumed available to the general public, school administrators included.  Legal experts agree that public information sources such as Facebook can be legally used in criminal or other investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/media/paper472/news/2005/11/03/CampusWatch/The-Facebook.Not.Just.For.Students-1044229.shtml | title=The Facebook: not just for students | date=2005-11-03 | accessdate=2006-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot]], community participation in assisting police to identify the rioters has been described as unprecedented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globaltvbc.com/Vancouver+riots+2011+Crown+look+potential+charges/4976048/story.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004041852/http://www.globaltvbc.com/Vancouver+riots+2011+Crown+look+potential+charges/4976048/story.html |archivedate=2011-10-04 |title=Vancouver riots 2011: Crown to look at potential charges |publisher=Global News |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Police admitted to being overwhelmed by the amount of evidence provided by social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2011/06/20/bc-vancouver-police-riot.html? | title=Police overwhelmed by social media evidence | date=2011-06-20 | accessdate=2011-06-20 | work=CBC News}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol policy violations===
It has become increasingly common for colleges and universities to use Facebook to investigate [[underage drinking]] and violations of [[dry campus]] policies. Students who violate these policies may be discovered through photographs of illicit drinking behavior, membership in drinking-related groups, or party information posted on the Facebook website.  Some examples of such investigations are listed below:

*In October 2005, pictures from Facebook were used to cite violators of university alcohol policy at [[North Carolina State University]].  Charges included underage drinking and violations of the dormitory alcohol policy, specifically holding open bottles of alcoholic beverages in the dorm hallway. A dorm resident advisor originally wrote up citations for 14 different students, some of which were dropped.  Details were not released by the university, but the incident received news coverage including articles in the official school newspaper and segments on local TV stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031084848/http://www.wral.com/news/5204275/detail.html |work=WRAL.com|title= NCSU Students Face Underage Drinking Charges Due To Online Photos|date=October 29, 2005|url=http://www.wral.com/news/5204275/detail.html|archivedate=October 31, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In November 2005, four students at [[Northern Kentucky University]] were fined for posting pictures of a drinking party on Facebook.  The pictures, taken in one of NKU's dormitories, proved that the students were in violation of the university's dry campus policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenortherner.com/news/2005/11/02/facebook-postings-photos-incriminate-dorm-party-goers/|work=The Northerner|title=Facebook postings, photos incriminate dorm party-goers|date=November 2, 2005|author= Chalfant, Drew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2005, [[Emory University]] officials cited members of the [[Facebook group]] "Dobbs 2nd Alcoholics," referring to the second floor of a campus residence hall, for conduct code violations.  A similar drinking group, "Wooddruff=Wasted," was also investigated.  The group's club members only discussed "having fun in Wooddruff" and said no photos of students were ever posted on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/03/29/1518943.htm|title=Officials at institutions nationwide using Facebook site|date=March 29, 2006|work=TMCNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In response to the monitoring, some students have begun to submit "[[Red herring (plot device)|red herring]]" party listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/09/facebook_prank_on_po.html|title=Facebook prank on police|work=Boing Boing|date=January 9, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111075622/http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/09/facebook_prank_on_po.html|archivedate=January 11, 2006|author=Pescovitz, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case at [[George Washington University]], students advertised their party and were raided by campus police. The police found only cake, no alcohol, and later claimed the dorm raid had been triggered by a noise complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051004133455/http://www.collegehumor.com/pictures/1607781/|title=How much cake is an inordinate amount?

===Other investigations===
*In December 2004, ''[[The Student Life]]'' (the [[student newspaper]] at [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]]) reported that an assistant football coach at the college had been living in the team's equipment room and hosting parties there. The paper cited postings by football players on a Facebook group page titled "We Miss Coach Baker" as evidence of the alleged parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213060242/http://www.tsl.pomona.edu/index.php?article=385|archivedate=December 13, 2004|title= Football Coaches Living, Partying in Rains Equipment Room|work=The Student Life|url=http://www.tsl.pomona.edu/index.php?article=385|author=Antenen, Jay|date=December 3, 2004|volume=116|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In October 2005, sophomore Cameron Walker was [[Expulsion (academia)|expelled]] from [[Fisher College]] in [[Boston]] for comments about a campus police officer made on Facebook.  These comments, including the statement that the officer "loves to antagonize students...and needs to be eliminated," were judged to be in violation of the college's code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/10/06/fisher_college_expels_student_over_website_entries/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Fisher College expels student over website entries | first=Sarah | last=Schweitzer | date=2005-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In November 2005, [[Kansas State University]] authorities announced that they were using Facebook to investigate a possible violation of the school's [[honor code]] potentially involving over 100 students.  Students used the message board of a Facebook group to share class information without authorization from the professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319042926/http://www.kstatecollegian.com/article.php?a=8004|title=Facebook involved in possible Honor Pledge violation|date=November 17, 2005|author=Kennedy, Owen|work=Kansas State Collegian|archivedate=March 19, 2006 |url=http://www.kstatecollegian.com/article.php?a=8004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In October 2005, [[Pennsylvania State University]] police used Facebook to track down students who rushed the field after the October 8 [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] game. Two students were later charged with criminal trespass for their involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208010655/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2005/11/11-10-05tdc/11-10-05dnews-09.asp|title=Site used to aid investigations|author=Lash, Devon|archivedate=December 8, 2005|date=November 10, 2005|work=The Digital Collegian|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2005/11/11-10-05tdc/11-10-05dnews-09.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In January 2006, [[Syracuse University]]'s student newspaper, ''[[The Daily Orange]]'', featured an article about a student who claimed Syracuse City Police personally warned him in advance about having a party he had listed on Facebook. The university denied the allegations and stated that their own [[peace officer]]s would have handled the case in any event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118160331/http://www.dailyorange.com/media/paper522/news/2006/01/25/News/Su.Officials.Use.Of.Facebook.Creates.Problems.For.Students.With.A.False.Sense.Of-1503587.shtml?norewrite|work=The Daily Orange|url=http://www.dailyorange.com/media/paper522/news/2006/01/25/News/Su.Officials.Use.Of.Facebook.Creates.Problems.For.Students.With.A.False.Sense.Of-1503587.shtml?norewrite|archivedate=November 18, 2007|title=SU officials' use of Facebook creates problems for students with a false sense of privacy|author=Pepitone, Julianne|date=January 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2006, ''The Daily Orange'' reported about another Syracuse University incident, in which four students were placed on disciplinary probation after creating a group entitled "Clearly [instructor's first name] doesn't know what she's doing ever." The group featured derogatory and personal attacks aimed at the instructor.  After meeting with judicial affairs, the students admitted that their comments on the site were inappropriate and accepted an agreement that they would not contact the instructor again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Daily Orange|url=http://dailyorange.com/2006/02/kicked-in-the-face-freshmen-claim-judicial-affairs-threatened-expulsion-for-creation-of-facebook-group-critical-of-ta/|date= February 7, 2006|title=Kicked in the face: Freshmen claim Judicial Affairs threatened expulsion for creation of Facebook group critical of TA|author=Pepitone, Julianne}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2006, police in Oxford, Ohio were directed to the Facebook profile of a [[Miami University]] student because it showed the [[Facial composite|police sketch]] of a suspect in the [[rape]] of another Miami University student as the account owner's personal picture.  The police arrested the student and charged him with inducing panic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Student arrested for inducing panic with Facebook picture |date=February 9, 2006 |author=Wolfe, Graham |publisher=[[The Miami Student]] |url=http://miamistudent.net/?p=107571 |accessdate=20 May 2015 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Students that had created a Facebook group to complain about a professor's teaching shortcomings at the [[University of Louisville]] were responsible in part for dismissal of that instructor in February 2006.  The students were not punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Opinion: Students should voice their rights in the classroom |date=February 6, 2006 |url=http://www.louisvillecardinal.com/2.6451/editorial-1.727846 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726073422/http://www.louisvillecardinal.com/2.6451/editorial-1.727846 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |work=[[The Louisville Cardinal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pictures posted of unrelated parties thrown by students at the [[University of Connecticut School of Law]] and [[Baylor University]] drew attention to the presence of uninstitutionalized racism on both campuses. In March 2006, Baylor’s student newspaper reported a call to action made by outraged students after pictures were posted on Facebook depicting partygoers wearing bandanas and carrying 40-ounce beer bottles wrapped in brown paper, with one young woman sporting layers of bronzer to darken her skin. An advisor for a campus fraternity denied the party was sponsored by the organization and said the party theme was not to dress "ghetto", as critics alleged, but as [[E-Dawg]], a Seattle rapper. Facebook removed the photos from the site as black student groups called for a university-sponsored open forum to discuss the racially insensitive undercurrent on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Similar action was taken with the UConn pictures, which depicted a "Bullets and Bubbly" themed party held days after [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Day in 2007. Half the partygoers brought champagne and dressed in formalwear for the "bubbly" portion of the theme, while the other half brought 40 ounces and dressed in do-rags, baggy hip-hop inspired clothing, gold teeth, and in some cases carried fake machine guns. The university responded by holding an open forum discussing the insensitive nature of the party and resulting photos. Controversy over similar parties has also occurred at [[Clemson University]] (South Carolina), [[Tarleton State University]] (Texas), [[Texas A&amp;M University]], and the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In April 2006, [[University of Dayton]] student Christopher Herbert was fined approximately $10,000 for damages caused by an annual event known as "LowesFest."  Herbert had posted a public invitation to the event on Facebook, though he did not attend the event himself.  The University informed him 24 hours before "LowesFest" that he would have to pay for any and all extra costs (police, cleaning, etc.) stemming from that evening. However, Christopher Herbert chose to not pay the fine and he transferred out of the University of Dayton.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110711013400/http://flyernews.com/articles/volume/53/issue/39/category/opinion/id/2659 Flyer News - Junior unfairly blamed for Lowesfest problems]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2006, officials at the [[State University of New York at Cobleskill]] took a student from [[Sri Lanka]], Tharindu Meepegama into custody after Meepegama posted pictures of him with a shotgun and wrote comments that the school officials found "troubling". Meepegama, who was later allowed to return to the school, said it was all a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name="news observer"&gt;{{cite news

* In August 2006, police officers at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] arrested two students who were spotted urinating in public.  One of the students ran, and the other was apprehended by police.  When queried about the identity of the student who ran, the student in custody lied saying he did not know him.  The arresting officer, upon talking with witnesses, obtained the name of the student who ran.  He later found that the two were Facebook friends, and therefore that the questioned student had lied.  This student was charged with obstruction of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516045506/http://media.www.dailyillini.com/media/storage/paper736/news/2006/08/01/News/Student.Arrested.After.Police.Facebook.Him-2142717.shtml|title=Student arrested after police Facebook him|author=Martinez, Kiyoshi|date=August 1, 2006|archivedate=May 16, 2007|work=The Daily Illini|url=http://media.www.dailyillini.com/media/storage/paper736/news/2006/08/01/News/Student.Arrested.After.Police.Facebook.Him-2142717.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2006, a male [[Southern Illinois University]] student faced possible expulsion for creating a Facebook page detailing his sexual relationship with a young female he’d been involved with in the past. Other male students added to the page with their own experiences with the woman, until she brought it to the attention of Facebook administrators, who permanently removed the page. The 19-year-old female cited slander while the young man claimed it was an inside joke and assumed she would understand the humor. In an interview he stated, "I never thought something on Facebook would get me into trouble out in the real world." During the debacle, his fellow students created yet another Facebook page with updates on the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In December 2006, campus police at the [[University of North Carolina at Wilmington]] were investigating the theft of two [[PlayStation]] consoles, which had been stolen by the two perpetrators of a beating and robbery on campus. They planned to raid the rented house of Peyton Strickland, an 18-year-old student at nearby [[Cape Fear Community College]]. They discovered that the other alleged robber, Ryan Mills, had posted photographs of himself on Facebook in which he posed with guns. Expecting "heavily armed resistance" at Strickland's house, the officers called in a [[SWAT team]] for backup to raid Strickland's house. When they arrived at the residence, which three students rented, they were not immediately let in. As one officer began to break down the door with a [[battering ram]], another officer mistook the sound of the battering ram for gunshots and shot through the glass door multiple times, killing the unarmed Strickland and his dog.&lt;ref name="news observer"/&gt; The officer, Christopher Long, was not charged with second-degree [[murder]] by two different [[grand jury|grand juries]].&lt;ref name="news observer"/&gt; He was however initially indicted by one grand jury, which was later attributed to a clerical error and overturned.

* In January 2007, a long-standing debate over the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]'s dancing [[Chief Illiniwek]] mascot intensified after racist remarks about [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were discovered on a pro-mascot Facebook group. The group, entitled "If They Get Rid of the Chief, I'm Becoming a Racist," contained wall posts by students that said things like, "What they don't realize is that there never was a racist problem before...but now I hate redskins and hope all those drunk casino owning bums die." Another student directed a post towards a particularly vocal Native American grad student, saying, "I say we throw a tomahawk into her face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Student government===
* In October 2005, [[University of Pennsylvania]] freshmen student government election results were delayed due to early campaigning violations on Facebook. Though candidates were forbidden from campaigning before a certain date, many Facebook advocacy groups appeared before that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wissner|first=Jennie|title=Accused students defend actions: Final results will not be released until NEC finishes deliberations|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2005/10/accused_students_defend_actions|accessdate=May 27, 2015|newspaper=[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]|date=October 3, 2005|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527133045/http://www.thedp.com/article/2005/10/accused_students_defend_actions|archive-date=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[High Point University]], and [[The George Washington University]] have also experienced similar problems. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Cyber-bullying===
Facebook and other social networking sites are being used to bring [[bullying]] outside of school. Students are being targeted on the internet and even mobile devices. A new strategy to catch cyber-bullies is being implemented in [[Reading, Berkshire]]: 
* From February 28, 2011 until May 2011, [[Thames Valley Police]] Officers will be using Facebook to catch cyber-bullies. With the help of a teenage volunteer, the police will go through Facebook pages to investigate reported instances of [[cyber-bullying]]. If there is anything inappropriate found, a Facebook message will be sent to the offender which will warn them of the consequences of bullying. Along with the message, the student's parents will also receive a letter highlighting the incident and the potential consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-02/28/police-facebook Thames Valley Police to use Facebook to catch cyberbullies (Wired UK)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305020141/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-02/28/police-facebook |date=2016-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2012, Lake Havasu Unified School District #1 used evidence found on Facebook to catch multiple cyber-bullies after a discussion on a post that the one who felt bullied was not involved in. The school district acquired the list of comments through another student, who printed them out and handed them in to the school administration.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
*In Bangalore, India, school students of certain schools were all asked to delete their Facebook profiles in the wake of cyber bullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/article/cities/no-facebook-bangalore-schools-ask-students-to-delete-profiles-435723 No Facebook! Bangalore schools ask students to delete profiles | NDTV.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Indian law addresses some of the components of cyber-bullying. However, the perpetrators are children and therefore alternatives to criminalization and other policies should be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=2396955 Cyber-Bullying in India: The Search for a Solution - Why the Current Law in India is Ill-Equipped by Mukta Batra :: SSRN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myspace==

*In February 2006, a 16-year-old [[Colorado]] boy was arrested for juvenile possession of a [[firearm]] after police saw pictures that he had posted on MySpace of himself posing with rifles and handguns.&lt;ref name="rocky mountain news"&gt;{{cite news

The '''''Wall of the Sun''''' and '''''Wall of the Moon''''' are a pair of [[mural]]s made of ceramics and designed by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] artist [[Joan Miró]] for the [[UNESCO]] building in Paris. The works were carried out by the ceramicist [[Josep Llorens Artigas]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=Dupin&gt;{{cite book|last=Dupin|first=Jacques|title=Miró|date=2004|publisher=Éditions Flammarion|location=Paris|isbn=2-0803-0450-X|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the walls were installed on the Place de Fontenoy in Paris, but afterwards were enclosed in a building that was constructed in order to protect them from damage caused by acid rain.&lt;ref name=Unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wall of the Sun|url=http://www.unesco.org/visit/uk/notices/miro1.htm|publisher=UNESCO website|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Joan Miró]] and [[Josep Llorens Artigas]] met in 1910 at the school of art of the artist [[Francesc Galí]] (1880–1965), in Barcelona. Since the 1940s, Miró and Josep Llorens Artigas started an artistic duo that spawned objects and large ceramic murals such as one at the [[Unesco]] building in Paris or the ceramic wall of the [[Barcelona–El Prat Airport|Barcelona Airport]]. These works fused Miró lexicon with the essential qualities of the arts of earth and fire.&lt;ref name=artigas&gt;{{Cite web | title= Joan Gardy Artigas, Spanish (1938 - )|url=http://rogallery.com/Artigas_Joan_Gardy/artigas-biography.html| editor = rogallery.com| accessdate= 28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Joan Miró was contacted by the heads of UNESCO to ask if he want to take part of the team of artists that decorated the future headquarters of the institution that is located in Paris.&lt;ref name=runner93&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corredor-Matheos|first=Josep|title=The Miró-Artigas Murals|journal=Catalonia Culture|date=October 1993|pages=34–37|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once agreed, they granted the exterior walls of the building conferences, two perpendicular walls of three meters high and seven meters long and fifteen, respectively. Miró proposed to make a ceramic mural in collaboration with Llorens Artigas.

In 1956, Miró began working on the mural in his studio in [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]]. The following year he went to the [[Cave of Altamira|Caves of Altamira]] in with Llorens Artigas inspired to carry on the work,&lt;ref name="Mink2000"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Janis |last=Mink|title=Joan Miró, 1893-1983|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDW3HgIw7aYC&amp;pg=PA93|year=2000|editor=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-5975-9|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Preckler2003"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Ana María |last=Preckler|title=Historia del arte universal de los siglos XIX y XX|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ_edWCq2UoC&amp;pg=PA236|date= 1 January 2003|editor=Editorial Complutense|isbn=978-84-7491-707-9|pages=236–}}&lt;/ref&gt; by seeing "the first mural in the world".&lt;ref name=BYN59&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miró|first=Joan|title=Como hice los murales para la UNESCO|journal=Blanco y Negro|date=6 July 1959|volume=2457|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also visit the [[Colegiata y Claustro de Santa Juliana]] and the romanesque collection of the Museum of Art of Catalonia, the current [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|MNAC]].&lt;ref name=runner93 /&gt;

=== Construction ===
Once inspired, Miró moved to [[Gallifa]], at the workshop of Artigas, to proceed to prepare the tile mural. It took 35 batches, 25 tons of wood, 4 tons of sandstone and 200 kilos of enamel.&lt;ref name=runner93 /&gt; Once finished, the pieces were transported to Paris. Although he had worked in large formats, he had never done ceramics. Beside the ceramist Josep Llorens Artigas, they failed to find technical feasibility for baking pottery in a way that allows to obtain a background textures similar to the paintings of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Rebull, Melania (1994) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided that the composition was on the subjects of "Sun" and "Moon".&lt;ref&gt;Malet, Rosa M. (1992) pg. 107-112&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inauguration ===
The two mosaic murals were assembled ''in situ'' by a team of technicians under the direct supervision of Miró and Llorens Artigas.&lt;ref name=caca/&gt; The works were inaugurated in 1958, as same as the building, and received rave reviews. Even one of the murals, the ''Wall of the Sun'' won the Biennial Prize of Guggenheim Foundation.&lt;ref name=runner93 /&gt;&lt;ref name=caca/&gt; Miró later return to work for UNESCO, designing the UNESCO Medal for [[Pablo Picasso]].

=== Conservation ===
Initially, the walls were outdoors, but later moved inside the building to protect them from damage caused by [[acid rain]].&lt;ref name=caca /&gt;
