'''''3:10 to Yuma''''' is a 2007 American [[Western (genre)|Western film]] directed by [[James Mangold]] and produced by [[Cathy Konrad]], and starring [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Christian Bale]] in the lead roles, with supporting performances by [[Peter Fonda]], [[Gretchen Mol]], [[Ben Foster]], [[Dallas Roberts]], [[Alan Tudyk]], [[Vinessa Shaw]], and [[Logan Lerman]]. It is about a drought-impoverished rancher (Bale) who takes on the dangerous job of taking a notorious outlaw (Crowe) to justice. It is a [[remake]] of the [[3:10 to Yuma (1957 film)|1957 film of the same name]], making it the second adaptation of [[Elmore Leonard]]'s short story "[[Three-Ten to Yuma]]". Filming took place in various locations in [[New Mexico]]. ''3:10 to Yuma'' opened September 7, 2007, in the United States and received positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metacritic" /&gt;

==Plot==
Dan Evans (Bale) is an impoverished rancher and [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]] veteran. He owes money to Glen Hollander (Loftin) and when he fails to pay, two of Hollander's men set fire to his barn. The next morning, as Evans and his two sons William (Lerman) and Mark look for their herd, they stumble upon outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) and his gang, who have taken advantage of Evans' cattle in order to block the road and ambush an armored [[stagecoach]] staffed by [[Pinkerton Government Services|Pinkerton]] agents. As Wade's outfit loots the upended stage, Wade discovers Evans and his two sons watching from the hills. Determining that they pose no threat to him and his gang, Wade takes their horses and tells Evans that he will leave them tied up on the road to [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]]. Wade's gang departs, and Evans rescues the lone surviving coach guard, Byron McElroy (Fonda), left alive but severely wounded by Wade.

Wade travels with his gang to Bisbee to celebrate at the local saloon and divide up the loot, then chooses to stay behind to enjoy the company of the barmaid while his gang departs. Evans arrives separately with McElroy and delivers him to Doc Potter (Tudyk), then tries in vain to negotiate with Hollander, who shoves him to the ground and departs. Enraged, Evans barges into the saloon looking for him, but instead encounters Wade emerging from an upstairs room. Evans coaxes a few dollars from Wade over the trouble the outlaw has caused him, delaying the outlaw long enough for the railroad men to ambush and arrest him.

The railroad's representative, Grayson Butterfield, enlists McElroy, Potter, Tucker (one of Hollander's men), and Evans, to deliver Wade to [[Contention City, Arizona|Contention]], where Wade will be put on the 3:10 afternoon train to [[Yuma Territorial Prison]]. Evans requests a $200 fee to deliver Wade for transport, which Butterfield accepts. From Evans' ranch, McElroy arranges a [[decoy]] wagon to distract Wade's gang, now led by [[Charlie Prince]], with the real prisoner transport departing later that night.

During the journey, both Tucker and McElroy provoke Wade, who in turn kills them. Wade attempts to escape, but is stopped when William appears, having followed the group all the way from the ranch. When the group is then attacked by [[Apache (tribe)|Apache]]s, Wade kills the attackers and escapes to a [[coolie|Chinese laborer]] construction camp, where the foreman captures him. Evans, William, Potter and Butterfield arrive to regain custody of their prisoner, but the local posse is unwilling to give him up, and a fight ensues. The group manages to escape, but Potter is killed in the process. The remaining foursome arrives in Contention hours before the train's arrival time and check into a hotel, where several [[Marshal#State and local marshals|local marshal]]s join them.

Wade's gang members ambush the decoy wagon, interrogating the lone survivor before killing him, then depart for Contention. Upon arriving, Prince offers a reward to any citizen who shoots any of Wade's captors, and numerous men volunteer, causing the town's marshals to desert immediately, only to be killed by Wade's men. Butterfield resigns as well, but agrees to keep William safe, as Evans is determined to complete the mission.

Evans escorts Wade out of the hotel, and the two make their way across town, evading continuous gunfire from the combined gang and townsmen. Wade surprises Evans and nearly strangles him, but relents when Evans reveals that delivering Wade to the train is not only to provide for his family, but to restore his own sense of honor, and give his sons something good to remember him for. Wade then admits he has already been to Yuma Prison and escaped twice, and agrees to board the train, allowing Evans' contract to be fulfilled.

Wade helps Evans evade his gang, and as he finally boards the train, congratulates Evans, but Prince appears from behind and shoots Evans despite Wade's order to stop. Wade steps off the train, and when Prince returns his gun belt, abruptly executes Prince along with the rest of his gang. William appears and draws his gun on Wade but does not kill him, instead turning to his dying father. Wade boards the train and politely surrenders his weapon. Evans dies as William tells him he accomplished his mission and got the money. As the train disappears around a bend, Wade whistles, and his faithful horse pricks up his ears and gallops after the train indicating that Wade is planning to escape.

==Production==
In June 2003, [[Columbia Pictures]] announced a negotiation with Mangold to helm a remake of the 1957 [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''3:10 to Yuma'', based on a script written by [[Michael Brandt]] and [[Derek Haas]].&lt;ref name="McNary"/&gt;  After being apart from the project for several years, Mangold resumed his role as director in February 2006.  Production was slated to begin in summer 2006.&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt;  In the same month, [[Tom Cruise]] expressed an interest in starring as the villain in the film.&lt;ref name="Cruise"/&gt; [[Eric Bana]] also briefly sought a role in the film.&lt;ref name="spurs"/&gt;

[[File:310YumaWagonFilming.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A stagecoach used during filming]]
In summer 2006, Columbia placed the film in [[turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], and the project was acquired by Relativity Media. Crowe and Bale were cast as the main characters, and Relativity began seeking a distributor for the film.&lt;ref name="spurs" /&gt;  By September, [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] signed on to distribute the film.&lt;ref name="distrib"/&gt;  Later in the month, [[Peter Fonda]], [[Gretchen Mol]], [[Dallas Roberts]], [[Ben Foster]], and [[Vinessa Shaw]] were cast.  Filming was slated to begin on October 23, 2006 in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="aboard"/&gt;  On the first day of filming, a rider and his horse were seriously injured in a scene when the horse ran directly into a camera-carrying vehicle instead of veering off as planned.  The rider was hospitalized, and the horse had to be [[euthanize]]d on the set.  The animal's death prompted an investigation from the [[American Humane Association]].&lt;ref name="AHA"/&gt;  By November, the AHA concluded its investigation, finding that the horse did not respond accordingly due to having received a dual training approach and the rider not being familiar with the mount.  The organization recommended no charges against the producers.&lt;ref name="SharpeOne"/&gt;  Principal photography took place in and around [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[Abiquiú, New Mexico|Abiquiú]], and [[Galisteo, New Mexico|Galisteo]].&lt;ref name="mishap"/&gt;  The Bonanza Creek Ranch represented the film's town of [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]] as a "kinder, gentler frontier town" while Galisteo was set up to be [[Contention City, Arizona|Contention]] (now a ghost town), a "much rougher, bawdier, kind of sin city".&lt;ref name="SharpeTwo"/&gt;  Another location was the scenic [[Caja del Rio#Diablo Canyon|Diablo Canyon]], and another was the Gilman Tunnels ({{coord|35.734081|-106.76475|scale:10000|display=inline}}) along [[New Mexico State Road 485]].  Filming concluded on January 20, 2007.&lt;ref name="mishap" /&gt;

After filming concluded, the owners of the [[Cerro Pelon Ranch]] petitioned to keep a $2 million expansion to the movie set on their property, which was supposed to be dismantled within 90 days.  The set of ''3:10 to Yuma'' made up 75% of the overall sets on the ranch.&lt;ref name="Cordova"/&gt;  In April 2007, the request was met by the county's development review committee to keep the expansion, which would potentially generate revenue in the future.&lt;ref name="KeepExpansion"/&gt;

==Release==
''3:10 to Yuma'' was originally slated for an October 5, 2007 release, but Lionsgate moved the film's release a month earlier to September 7, 2007 to beat competing Western films ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' and ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]''.  As a result of the move, the studio was not able to use the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] as a platform for the film's release, but it was released before a cluster of films similarly vying for awards.  According to Lionsgate president [[Tom Ortenberg]], "In what is shaping up to be a very impressive and crowded field of upscale commercial motion pictures this fall, we wanted to be one of the first ones out, so that everything else will be measured against us." The earlier theatrical run positioned it for a prominent high-definition [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[DVD]] release in the first week of January, during awards seasons.  Lionsgate similarly planned this strategy for ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] that year.&lt;ref name="Lionsgate"/&gt;

In Germany, the film was released by [[Columbia Pictures]], which had produced the 1957 original.

==Reception==

===Box office===
''3:10 to Yuma'' debuted in the United States and Canada on September 7, 2007, in 2,652 theaters.  In its opening weekend, the film grossed $14,035,033 and ranked #1 at the U.S. and Canadian box office.  ''3:10 to Yuma'' grossed an estimated $53,606,916 in the United States and $16,409,304 in other territories for a worldwide total of $70,016,220.&lt;ref name="BoxOfficeMojo"/&gt;&lt;!-- Please update the accessdate attribute when you update the box office information! --&gt;

===Critical response===
''3:10 to Yuma'' received positive reviews from critics. Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a rating of 89%, based on 219 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "The remake of this classic Western improves on the original, thanks to fiery performances from Russell Crowe and Christian Bale as well as sharp direction from James Mangold."&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes" /&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 76 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="Metacritic" /&gt;

[[Andrew Sarris]] of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' said "There is more greed-driven corruption in the remake than there was in the original" and that the film is less a remake "than a resurrection of both the film and its now unfashionable genre." Sarris said Fonda and Foster "are especially memorable" and said "the performances of Mr. Crowe and Mr. Bale alone are worth the price of admission."&lt;ref name="Sarris"/&gt;
''[[The New Yorker]]'' film critic [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] wrote that the film "is faster, more cynical, and more brutal" than the 1957 film.  Denby wrote that Fonda "gives an amazingly fierce performance" and that Crowe "gives a fascinating, self-amused performance", saying "Crowe is an acting [[genius]]."  Denby said "this is by far [director James Mangold's] most sustained and evocative work." Denby wrote that "much of this Western is tense and intricately wrought."&lt;ref name="Denby"/&gt;
[[Ty Burr]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called the film "lean, almost absurdly satisfying."  Burr wrote that Crowe and Bale "are among the best, most intuitively creative we have, and whatever transpires offscreen in Crowe’s case, onscreen they only serve their characters. Neither man showboats here, and it’s a thrill to watch them work."  Burr said that the character of Ben Wade is "a snake and a snake charmer in one irresistible package" and said Foster as Charlie Prince is "mesmerizing." Burr said "Bale and Crowe never once misstep" and that Mangold "steers clear of ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' revisionism."  Burr, however, wrote that the ending "makes little to no sense in a post-[[Clint Eastwood]] universe."&lt;ref name="Burr" /&gt;

Bruce Westbrook of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' gave the film 3½ stars and called it "the best Western since ''[[Unforgiven]]''", calling it "both cathartic and intelligent."  He wrote that the film "draws clear inspiration from the lonely heroics of ''[[High Noon]]''" and said "While a wildly eventful action-adventure and outlaw shoot-'em-up, it's also a vibrant story of heroism, villainy and hard-earned redemption."  Westbrook said that Crowe and Bale are "at the top of their game" and "Crowe is reliably charismatic as a man who's less craven and bloodthirsty than wise, resourceful and expedient."&lt;ref name="Westbrook" /&gt; [[Shawn Anthony Levy|Shawn Levy]] of ''[[The Oregonian]]'' gave the film a "B+" and said the film is "grounded in something like the credible realism of a [[John Ford]] Western but which also can appease the thirsts for blood, wit and tension harbored by fans of [[Quentin Tarantino]]."  Levy wrote "The original film spends much time on conversation between Wade and Evans and focuses more on Evans' wife, whereas the new film has more action sequences and is infused subtly with themes that echo vexing contemporary political and moral issues."  Levy said "Christian Bale gives us another of his wounded, desperate, stubborn men" and "Russell Crowe fills a role originated by [[Glenn Ford]] with a big dose of the mocking charisma, cool discernment and casual cruelty of [[Robert Mitchum]]."  Levy said the climax "sews up the narrative too quickly", but called the film "a fine and sturdy picture."&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt;

''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' critic Peter Rainer gave the film a "B+" and wrote "what [[Alfred Hitchcock]] once said about thrillers also applies to Westerns: The stronger the bad guy, the better the film.  By that measure, ''3:10 to Yuma'' is excellent."  Comparing the film to the 1957 film, Rainer wrote that the film "is larger in scope than its predecessor, and significantly altered in its ending, but essentially it's the same old morality play."  Rainer said the "drippy father-son stuff is the least successful aspect of the movie."  Rainer also wrote "Bale acts as if he's still playing the [[POW]] survivalist from [[Werner Herzog]]'s ''[[Rescue Dawn]]''" and said "his hyperrealistic performance is a drag next to Crowe's dapper prince of darkness."  Rainer said Crowe's "underplaying here is in many ways as hammy as if he were overplaying, and that's just fine."&lt;ref name="Rainer"/&gt; 
[[Richard Schickel]] of [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] said "when a movie is as entertaining as this one, you begin to think this formerly beloved genre is due for a revival."  Schickel said the 1957 film "was, in my opinion, not as good as a lot of people thought" and said Crowe "never settles for predictability when he's on screen and never lets us settle into complacency as we watch him."  Schickel wrote that director Mangold "never loses his crispness or his narrative efficiency." Schickel said the comparisons to ''Unforgiven'' "are not entirely apt", saying that "Mangold's offering lacks the blackness and absurdity" of that film.  He wrote, "It is more in the vein of [[Anthony Mann]]'s westerns of the 1950s — trim, efficiently paced, full of briskly stated conflicts that edge up to the dark side, but never fully embrace it."&lt;ref name="Schickel"/&gt;

===Awards and nominations===

'''[[576i]]''' is a [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] video mode originally used for [[broadcast television]] in most countries of the world where the [[utility frequency]] for electric power distribution is 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. Because of its close association with the color encoding system, it is often referred to as simply '''[[PAL]]''', PAL/[[SECAM]] or [[SECAM]] when compared to its 60&amp;nbsp;Hz (typically, see [[PAL-M]]) [[NTSC]]-color-encoded counterpart, [[480i]]. In digital applications it is usually referred to as "576i"; in analogue contexts it is often called "'''625 lines'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/576i.cfm|title=576i - AfterDawn: Glossary of technology terms &amp; acronyms|first=|last=AfterDawn.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the aspect ratio is usually 4:3 in analogue transmission and 16:9 in [[Digital Video Broadcasting|digital transmission]].

The ''576'' identifies a vertical resolution of 576 lines, and the ''i'' identifies it as an [[interlacing|interlaced]] resolution. The [[field rate]], which is 50 [[Hertz|Hz]], is sometimes included when identifying the video mode, i.e. '''576i50'''; another notation, endorsed by both the [[International Telecommunication Union]] in [[BT.601]] and SMPTE in [[SMPTE 259M]], includes the [[frame rate]], as in '''576i/25'''.

Its basic parameters common to both analogue and digital implementations are: 576 scan lines or vertical pixels of picture content, 25 frames (giving 50 fields) per second.

In analogue [[Vertical blanking interval|49 additional lines without image content]] are added to the displayed frame of 576 lines to allow time for older [[cathode ray tube]] circuits to retrace for the next frame,&lt;ref&gt;The 625-line television standard was introduced in the early 1950s. After tracing a frame on a CRT, the electron beam has to be moved from the bottom right to the top left of the screen ready for the next frame. The beam is blanked, no information is transmitted for the duration of 49 lines, and circuitry relatively slow by modern standards executes the retrace.&lt;/ref&gt; giving 625 lines per frame. Digital information not to be displayed as part of the image can be transmitted in the non-displayed lines; [[teletext]] and other services and test signals are often implemented.

Analogue television signals have no pixels; they are rastered in scan lines, but along each line the signal is continuous. In [[digital television|digital]] applications, the number of pixels per line is an arbitrary choice as long as it fulfils the [[sampling theorem]]. Values above about 500 pixels per line are enough for conventional free-to-air television; DVB-T, DVD and DV allow better values such as 704 or 720.

The video format can be transported by major [[digital television]] formats, [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] and [[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting|ISDB]], and on [[DVD]], and it supports [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratios]] of standard [[4:3]] and [[anamorphic widescreen|anamorphic]] [[16:9]].

==Baseband interoperability (analogue)==
[[File:Pal channel.svg|thumb|400px|right|Spectrum of a System I (bands IV and V) television channel with PAL or SECAM color]]

When 576i video is transmitted via baseband (i.e., via consumer device cables, not via [[radio frequency|RF]]), most of the differences between the [[broadcast television system|"one-letter" systems]] are no longer significant, other than vertical resolution and frame rate.

In this context, unqualified '''576i''' invariably means
* 625 lines per frame, of which 576 carry picture content
* 25 frames per second interlaced yielding 50 fields per second
* Two interlaced video fields per frame
* With [[PAL]] or [[SECAM]] color (4.43&amp;nbsp;MHz or 3.58&amp;nbsp;MHz (576i-N &amp; 576i-NC))
* [[Frequency modulated|frequency-modulated]] or [[amplitude modulated|amplitude-modulated]] audio (mono)
* Mono or stereo audio, if sent via connector cables between devices

==Modulation for TVRO transmission==
576i when it is transmitted over [[Television receive-only|free-to-air satellite]] signals is transmitted substantially differently from terrestrial transmission.

Full transponder mode (e.g., 72&amp;nbsp;MHz)
* Luma signal is frequency-modulated (FM), but with a 50&amp;nbsp;Hz [[dithering]] signal to spread out energy over the transponder
* Chroma is phase-modulated (PM)
* An FM subcarrier of 4.50, 5.50, 6.0, 6.50 or 6.65&amp;nbsp;MHz is added for mono sound
* Other FM subcarriers (usually 7.02, 7.20, 7.38, 7.56, 7.74 and 7.92&amp;nbsp;MHz) are added for a true-stereo service and can also carry multi-lingual sound and radio services. These additional subcarriers are normally narrower bandwidth than the main mono subcarrier and are companded using Panda 1 or similar to preserve the signal-to-noise ratio.
* Data subcarriers may also be added

Half-transponder mode (e.g., 36&amp;nbsp;MHz)
* All of the above is done, but signal is bandwidth-limited to 18&amp;nbsp;MHz
* The bandwidth limiting does not affect audio subcarriers

==Baseband interoperability (digital)==
In digital video applications, such as [[DVD]]s and [[Digital Video Broadcasting|digital broadcasting]], color encoding is no longer significant; in that context, '''576i''' means only
* 576 frame lines
* 25 frames or 50 fields per second
* Interlaced video
* PCM audio ([[baseband]])

There is no longer any difference (in the digital domain) between PAL and SECAM. Digital video uses its own separate [[color space]], so even the minor color space differences between PAL and SECAM become moot in the digital domain.

==Use with progressive sources==
When 576i is used to transmit content that was originally composed of 25 full progressive frames per second, the odd field of the frame is transmitted first. This is the opposite than of [[NTSC]]. Systems which recover progressive frames, or transcode video should ensure that this field order is obeyed, otherwise the recovered frame will consist of a field from one frame and a field from an adjacent frame, resulting in 'comb' interlacing artifacts.

==PAL speed-up==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[NTSC]] --&gt;
{{anchor|576i speed-up}}
[[Motion picture]]s are typically shot on film at 24 frames per second. When [[telecine]]d and played back at PAL's standard of 25 frames per second, films run about 4% faster. This also applies to most TV series that are shot on film or digital 24p.&lt;ref name=pal-speed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaeldvd.com.au/Articles/PALSpeedUp/PALSpeedUp.asp |title=PAL speedup |website=www.michaeldvd.com.au |author=Demtschyna, Michael |date=2 November 1999 |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike NTSC's telecine system, which uses [[Telecine#2:3 pulldown|3:2 pulldown]] to convert the 24 frames per second to the 30 fps frame rate, PAL speed-up results in the telecined video running 4% shorter than the original film as well as the equivalent NTSC telecined video.

Depending on the sound system in use, it also slightly increases the pitch of the soundtrack by 70.67 [[cent (music)|cents]] (0.7067 of a [[semitone]]). More recently, digital conversion methods have used algorithms which preserve the original pitch of the soundtrack, although the frame rate conversion still results in faster playback.

Conversion methods exist that can convert 24 frames per second video to 25 frames per second with no speed increase, however image quality suffers when conversions of this type are used. This method is most commonly employed through conversions done digitally (i.e. using a computer and software like [[VirtualDub]]), and is employed in situations where the importance of preserving the speed of the video outweighs the need for image quality.

Many movie enthusiasts prefer PAL over NTSC despite the former's speed-up, because the latter results in [[Telecine#Telecine judder|telecine judder]], a visual distortion not present in PAL sped-up video.&lt;ref name="Enthusiasts"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060114015926/http://www.dvdlard.co.uk/Content.aspx?ContentID=109 DVDLard] www.dvdlard.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; states ''"the majority of authorities on the subject favour PAL over NTSC for DVD playback quality"''. Also DVD reviewers often make mention of this cause. For example, in his PAL vs. NTSC article,&lt;ref name=pal-v-ntsc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaeldvd.com.au/Articles/PALvsNTSC/PALvsNTSC.asp |title=PAL vs. NTSC |website=www.michaeldvd.com.au |author=Demtschyna, Michael |date=7 July 2000 |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of  MichaelDVD says: ''"Personally, I find [3:2 pulldown] all but intolerable and find it very hard to watch a movie on an NTSC DVD because of it."'' In the DVD review of [[Frequency (film)|''Frequency'']],&lt;ref name=freq-review&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaeldvd.com.au/Reviews/Reviews.asp?ID=3999 |title=DVD review ''Frequency'' (2000) - R4 vs R1  |website=www.michaeldvd.com.au |author=Williams, Paul |date=28 January 2001|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of his reviewers mentions: ''"because of the 3:2 pull-down artefacts that are associated with the NTSC format (…) I prefer PAL pretty much any day of the week"''. This is not an issue on modern [[Video scaler|upconverting]] DVD players and [[personal computer]]s, as they play back 23.97 frame/s–encoded video at its true frame rate, without 3:2 pulldown.

PAL speed-up does not occur on native 25 fps video, such as British or European TV-series or movies that are shot on video instead of film.

Software which corrects the speed-up is available for those viewing 576i DVD films on their computers, [[WinDVD|WinDVD's]] "PAL TruSpeed" being the most ubiquitous{{Citation needed|reason=Statements like this need some data to support them|date=April 2014}}. However, this method involves resampling the soundtrack(s), which results in a slight decrease in audio quality. There is also a DirectShow Filter for Windows called ReClock developed by RedFox (formerly SlySoft) which can be used in a custom DirectShow Graph to remap the reference audio timing clock to correct the clock timing skew using an accurate self-adaptive algorithm resulting in effective removal of judder during panning caused by Euro pulldown including audio pitch correction via time-stretching with WASAPI Exclusive Mode and SPDIF AC/3 Encoding output modes.

==Background and artistic contribution==
Roser has made a major contribution working with marionettes. He first came to public attention in 1951 with his marionette, ''Clown Gustaf''.&lt;ref name="Baird, B p.193"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baird, B, ''The Art of the Puppet'', p.206&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his characters, ''Grandmother'', is outwardly charming but savagely humorous in her observations about all aspects of society and the absurdities of life.&lt;ref name="Billington, M p.163"/&gt;

Roser has toured worldwide with resounding success. He has made 7 tours through Asia and Australia and 17 tours in North and South America.&lt;ref name="Baird, B p.193"/&gt; A large number of his tours were organised with assistance from the German Cultural Institute.

In 1977, Roser was invited to spend a semester as guest artist at the University of Connecticut, United States of America, by the Department of Puppetry. In 1983 he established the Figurentheaterschule Stuttgart, a school for puppetry at the Conservatory for Music and the Dramatic Arts, where he was professor and head of the department.

Roser's work was admired by master puppeteer [[Jim Henson]], who made a film on Roser's work.&lt;ref&gt;'' The World of Puppetry with Albrecht Roser'' (1985)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amerika''''' is an American television [[miniseries]] that was [[1987 in television|broadcast in 1987]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The miniseries inspired a [[novelization]] entitled ''Amerika: The Triumph of the American Spirit''. ''Amerika'' starred [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Mariel Hemingway]], [[Sam Neill]], [[Robert Urich]], and a 17-year-old [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] in her first major role. ''Amerika'' was about life in the United States after a [[coup d'état|bloodless takeover]] engineered by the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="gl"&gt;Guy Lometti, "Amerika", in Horace Newcomb, ''Encyclopedia of Television''.  London, Routledge, 2005. {{ISBN|9781135194727}}  (pp. 104–5)&lt;/ref&gt; Not wanting to depict the actual takeover, ABC Entertainment president [[Brandon Stoddard]] set the miniseries ten years after the event, focusing on the demoralized U.S. people a decade after the Soviet conquest. The intent, he later explained, was to explore the U.S. spirit under such conditions, not to portray the conflict of the Soviet coup.

Described in promotional materials as "the most ambitious American miniseries ever created," ''Amerika'' aired for 14½ hours (including commercials) over seven nights (beginning February 15, 1987), and reportedly cost US$40 million to produce. The miniseries was filmed in the [[Golden Horseshoe]] and [[southwestern Ontario]] [[Canada|Canadian]] cities of [[Toronto]], [[London, Ontario|London]],&lt;ref&gt;''The old South Street campus of [[Victoria Hospital (London, Ontario)|Victoria Hospital]] in London, Ontario, was the site that depicted the "Peoples' Acceptance Hospital" in [[Omaha]], in what the storyline refers to as the former [[U.S. state]] of [[Nebraska]].''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]],&lt;ref name=hamfilm&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/List?endings=on&amp;&amp;locations=Hamilton,+Ontario,+Canada |title=List of Films shot in Hamilton, Ontario|work=[[IMDb]]|publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]|accessdate=January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various locations in the U.S. [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Nebraska]] – most notably the small town of [[Tecumseh, Nebraska|Tecumseh]], which served as "Milford", the fictional setting for most of the series. [[Donald Wrye]] was the executive producer, director, and writer of ''Amerika'', while composer [[Basil Poledouris]] scored the miniseries, ultimately recording (with the [[Hollywood Symphony Orchestra]]) eight hours of music – the equivalent of four feature films.&lt;ref name="gl" /&gt;

==Genesis==
''Amerika'' has an indirect connection to another notable ABC program, the 1983 television film ''[[The Day After]]'', which some critics felt was too [[pacifism|pacifist]] for portraying the doctrine of nuclear deterrence as pointless.  Stoddard cited a column in the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]'' by [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] speechwriter (and later, television personality) [[Ben Stein]] that appeared a few weeks before ''The Day After'' aired. Stein wrote, in part:

{{blockquote|...since my dear friends at ABC-TV have made a TV movie very rightly describing the terror of an atomic attack on America, perhaps they might consider something else. Perhaps they might make a TV movie about why the people of the United States face such a dreadful risk.  They might make a movie about what life in the United States would be like if we lived under Soviet domination.

Here is the idea: Let's have a movie called "In Red America." It would be about a few days or weeks in the life of several American families after the Soviet Union had taken over America.}}

Stoddard acknowledged that Stein's remarks provided the inspiration for the series. Stein received a [[quitclaim deed|quitclaim fee]] for the idea and otherwise was not involved in the production of "Amerika".&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/arts/tv-view-amerkia-slogging-through-a-muddle.html "TV VIEW; 'AMERKIA' (sic) – SLOGGING THROUGH A MUDDLE"] By [[John J. O'Connor (journalist)|John J. O'Connor]]. Published February 15, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Originally envisioned as a four-hour made-for-TV movie entitled "Topeka, Kansas, U.S.S.R.", the project soon was expanded into a miniseries.

== Plot ==
[[File:Tecumseh, Nebraska city hall from SW.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The city hall and downtown area of Tecumseh, Nebraska, served as the fictional Milford, Nebraska.]]

[[File:John Cattle Seward NE.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The John Cattle Jr.-Hughes Mansion in Seward, Nebraska, served as the Bradford home in Milford.]]

=== Major characters ===
The storyline of ''Amerika'' primarily follows three political leaders:
*'''Devin Milford''' (played by [[Kris Kristofferson]]): a maverick politician before the Soviet occupation who ran for President in 1988 (in the novel, 1992), after the Soviet takeover began.  Milford was placed in a [[internment|prison camp]] for daring to speak the truth about the Soviet conquest; at the beginning of the miniseries, Devin is declared "rehabilitated" and released back into society into the custody of his father, who lives in the Nebraska county run by Peter Bradford.
*'''Colonel Andrei Denisov''' of the [[KGB]] (played by [[Sam Neill]]): the Soviet administrator for the American Central Administrative Area.  He is romantically involved with actress Kimberly Ballard (played by [[Mariel Hemingway]]). Andrei's superior and mentor is General Petya Samanov (played by [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]), the Soviet military leader in charge of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Samanov's [[shoulder boards]] indicate a rank of [[Colonel General]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Peter Bradford''' (played by [[Robert Urich]]): a county administrator in [[Nebraska]] who cooperates with the Soviets to create a better life for his community.  He attracts the attention of the Soviet leadership because, while cooperative, he is independent and respected by his constituents. At the series' climax, the Soviets carve a new country called "Heartland" out of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], with Bradford as its "Governor-General."

Major female characters, in addition to Ballard, include Peter Bradford's wife, Amanda (played by [[Cindy Pickett]]), Devin Milford's ex-wife, Marion (played by [[Wendy Hughes]]), and most notably, Devin's sister Alethea (played by [[Christine Lahti]]), who at the outset is prostituting herself to the local occupation leader. "Alethea is the center," noted Donald Wrye. "She is a metaphor for America – not just phonically – and it is she who discovers her moral core through(out) the course of the series." [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] played Bradford's teenage daughter, Jackie.

The human drama of these characters intersects with the political intrigue of the Soviet plans for the breakup of the United States. Bradford, the pragmatist, clashes with Milford, the idealist; Bradford's wife is Milford's ex-girlfriend, who finds she still has feelings for Milford upon his release from the prison camp; Denisov appoints Milford's ex-wife, a powerful magistrate (and General Samanov's mistress), to serve as Bradford's deputy and assistant in Heartland; and Kimberly's renewed sense of U.S. pride ultimately affects her relationship with Denisov.

=== Backstory ===
Towards the end of the 1980s, as the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|decline]] of the [[Soviet Union]] puts it in danger of losing the [[Cold War]], the Soviet leadership makes a desperate gamble to rearrange the global [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]].  Four large [[thermonuclear weapons]] are detonated in the [[ionosphere]] over the United States. The resulting [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] (or EMP) destroys the nation's communications and computer systems, cripples the U.S. electrical grid, and affects any equipment that relies on computer technology, such as most late-model automobiles. With its [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] inoperative—and the [[National Command Authority]] unable to contact U.S. military forces abroad or their foreign [[NATO|allies]] in western Europe to launch a counterattack—the U.S. is forced to accept Soviet terms for [[Surrender (military)|surrender]]: unilateral disarmament, the end of the dollar as a [[reserve currency]], and integration into the Soviet military/economic bloc. The United States quickly falls under Soviet military occupation under the command of Russian General Petya Samanov, and the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] and [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] become mere [[puppet government|figureheads]] for their Soviet overseers.

The above events are implied in the miniseries, although never directly explained. The description is taken from the novelization of the miniseries, ''Amerika: The Triumph of the American Spirit'' by [[Brauna E. Pouns]] and Donald Wrye (Pocket Books, 1987), based on Wrye's screenplay. Communications between the administrative areas have been cut off, and the damage to the electrical grid caused by the EMP attack has never been fully repaired.

=== Geopolitical situation ===
A decade after its defeat, the contiguous United States is occupied by a [[United Nations]] [[United Nations peacekeeping|peacekeeping]] force, the United Nations Special Service Unit (UNSSU), composed primarily of [[Communist state]] forces. The UNSSU in Milford is under a command of an officer from [[East Germany]], Major Helmut Gurtman (played by [[Reiner Schöne]]). UNSSU troops periodically engage in destructive [[combined arms]] training exercises which are deliberately intimidating to the local population.

Those Americans who engage in dissent are stripped of their privileges and sent to exile camps, where they are anathema to the Soviets and their fellow citizens. Association and communication with the exiles is prohibited and forbidden, although some risk their own remaining freedoms by offering humanitarian aid. [[Production quota]]s have been imposed, and foodstuffs rationed, with the surplus being shipped to the Soviet Union.

Against this background, Bradford ascends to the leadership as Governor General of Heartland. He acts a collaborator, hoping to reform the Soviet occupation from within with ideals of the old United States. Milford is released from the prison camp, hoping to be reunited with his children and fight to end the occupation and restore the United States. Denisov hopes to "salvage as much as possible" of the old U.S., while realizing that the U.S. essentially must cease to exist as a nation in order to appease the Soviet Union's leadership.

=== Climax and resolution ===
The Soviet leaders of the occupation are faced with the dual problem of keeping the U.S. pacified and convincing the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] that their fears of a revitalized U.S. are unfounded because the country can no longer pose a threat. The Politburo is not convinced, and considers exploding [[nuclear weapons]] over four or five unnamed U.S. cities as a warning to the U.S. people and to the world. Samanov and Denisov, both of whom want Soviet control of the United States to be relatively humane, are horrified by this idea.

At great personal risk, Samanov convinces the Soviet leadership to accept a compromise plan. The United States will be divided into "[[client state]]s", such as Heartland. Additionally, members of the [[United States Congress]] will be executed if they refuse to dissolve the nation's government and disperse in peace. After Samanov asks the assembled Congress to disband the [[legislative]] body and dissolve the United States government, the members angrily refuse to do so. Samanov walks out of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] chamber and his men begin firing into the crowd of legislators. All the members of Congress are killed in the attack, along with the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] and the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. The [[United States Capitol]] building and the artwork in its rotunda are destroyed in a terrorist-style attack. After the act is carried out, Samanov surveys the damage and the dead bodies of the members of Congress. He then sits in the United States House of Representatives chamber and commits [[suicide]].

In the final episode of the miniseries, Heartland is about to secede from the United States, with other regions to follow within the next few weeks. Instead, Heartland soldiers and local militia attack the local UNSSU compound. There is talk of a "[[Second American Revolution]]" that could undermine the Soviet Union's plans to break up the United States. The miniseries ends on a downbeat note, however, when Devin Milford is shot and killed as he is about to make a nationwide broadcast calling on Americans to resist the breakup of the United States. With Milford gone, the hopes to restore the United States through the resistance is muted. Although there is hope that the spirit of the U.S. lives on in the hearts and minds of some people, in the end it appears that the Soviet plan to dissolve the United States will come into being.

Some sources have claimed that the finale of the miniseries was deliberately left unresolved to allow for the possibility of a weekly television series [[sequel]]; but such plans never materialized.

=== The divided United States ===
In this fictional timeline, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] divided the United States into multiple "administrative areas" in 1988, one year after the Communist takeover. These areas are intended to become polities modelled on the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], joined together in a new [[North American Union]]. A map shown on screen reveals these administrative areas to be:

*California Special District: [[California]], [[Nevada]]
*Western Semi-Autonomous: [[Colorado]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Utah]], [[Wyoming]]
*Northwest: [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]
*Southwest: [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]]
*North Central: [[Minnesota]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Wisconsin]], and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]].
*Central: [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]] (this is Peter Bradford's administrative area, and the territory which eventually becomes Heartland, with [[Omaha, Nebraska]] as its capital)
*South Central: [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]]
*Southern: [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Mississippi]]
*Mid-Atlantic: [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Virginia]]
*Appalachia: [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[West Virginia]]
*Ameritech: [[Indiana]], the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]] (presumably named after the [[Ameritech|phone company]] that serviced these areas)
*Northeastern: [[Connecticut]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]]

In addition to these areas, [[Washington, D.C.]] comprises its own National Administrative District, South [[Florida]] is described by a character as the "Space Zone," and there is a passing reference to three "International Cities," one of which is [[San Francisco]].  [[Michigan]] is separated into two administrative regions, with the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] belonging to Ameritech, and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] belonging to the North Central region. [[Alaska]] is described as never having been pacified, requiring continued engagement by Soviet troops, and there are pockets of armed resistance in the [[Rocky Mountains]] and in [[West Virginia]]. There is no mention of what has happened to [[Hawaii]], or to U.S. territories such as [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], and [[American Samoa]].

The [[Rust Belt]] (presumably "Ameritech") faces its own special problems. Most of its advanced factory equipment was removed at the start of the occupation and taken to the Soviet Union. The region suffers 50% unemployment as a result, and its residents are not permitted to leave, except to volunteer for factory work in the Soviet Union, from which no one has yet returned.

Travel and communications between the various zones is heavily restricted, part of the "[[divide and rule|divide and conquer]]" plan of the Soviet occupation.

=== Communist occupation elsewhere ===
Both the novel and miniseries imply that the Soviet Union has conquered other countries after the U.S. coup (it can be surmised, for example, that the EMP which disabled U.S. technology also would have crippled [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]], a minor character says that he and his wife fled East Germany for the United States and remarked that "the promised land [had] become worse than what [they] left", and Denisov says at one point that "we control most of the world").

In this new world, [[Fidel Castro]] heads what is now called "Greater [[Cuba]]", embracing most of the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]], and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] has been [[Chinese unification|absorbed]] into China. [[North Korea]] has conquered and occupied [[South Korea]] and Korea is [[Korean reunification|united]] under Communist rule. A politician named "Mbele" heads the "Socialist Republic of Southern Africa" which also includes [[South Africa]], "Barghout" is the leader of "Iraqistan" which includes present day [[Israel]] and all of the [[Arab world]] in both the Middle East and North Africa. [[Eastern Europe]] is in a state of unrest, echoing the turmoil in the former United States. The Soviet leader mentions being stationed in England before being posted in America, implying that Western Europe is also under Soviet control, much like America.

=== National symbols ===
The flag of the occupation is the pale blue [[Flag of the United Nations|United Nations flag]], with crossed [[Flag of the United States|U.S.]] and [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flags]] superimposed on the sides. The U.S. flag is shown without its stars, and this flag is displayed during the "Lincoln Week" ceremonies. The standard U.S. flag is outlawed, although one scene shows a group of war veterans marching with the old U.S. flag upside down, this being a [[distress signal]]. The U.S. [[national anthem]], "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]," also is outlawed, but this does not stop a group of citizens from singing it (haltingly at first) after the "Lincoln Week" parade.

[[Abraham Lincoln]] is included with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] in propaganda. One of the signature scenes in the film is a twenty-minute, dialogue-free depiction of the celebration of "Lincoln Week" (a holiday replacing the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]), with both Lincoln and Lenin displayed on red banners that were most likely intended to be striking and startling to television audiences of the time.

A new [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] is given by "rehabilitated" political prisoners upon release from the U.S. [[gulags]]. While the prisoners are told that they are free to refuse to make this pledge, the circumstances under which it is administered suggest otherwise. The pledge states: 

{{quote|I pledge my allegiance to the flag of the community of American, Soviet, and United Nations of the World, and to the principle for which it stands – a nation, indivisible with others of the Earth, joined in peace, and justice for all.}}

=== Social criticism and commentary===
Although it aired only two years before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]], ''Amerika'' implied that American apathy and an unwillingness to defend [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] on the part of many citizens made the Soviet takeover rather easy. At one point, a key Soviet official observes that their plans for conquering the United States succeeded far beyond their wildest dreams, because once the nation had been defeated, the U.S. turned inward, not caring about national issues, seeking only to retain a piece of the prosperity that had once been theirs. "[The Soviet coup] worked because you lost your country before we ever got here," says the Soviet leader. "You had political freedom, but you lost your passion [...] How could we not win?"

This theme is echoed by Devin Milford later in the film:

{{quote|Nobody wanted to risk anything for anybody else. Everybody was afraid they were going to lose what they had. They knew it was bad. They were just afraid it'd get worse. That's all they lived for – for things not to get worse.}}

Further dialogue, by politician Peter Bradford, lashes out at apathetic U.S. attitudes:

{{quote|Damn, I'm so tired of this "I'm an American" bull! Where was all that patriotism when it counted? Where was that willingness to sacrifice? Nobody wanted to join the damn army to defend the country unless they got paid well! Nobody wanted to give any time to public service unless they could make a career out of it! And I didn't notice a lot of us giving up our lives in the last 10 years!}}

A speech delivered by one child (Devin Milford's son) demonstrates the extent of Soviet indoctrination in the new U.S.:

{{quote|We are the voice of the new generation. We are the voice of the new people. The destructive ways of the past are gone. We will replace them with our vision of the future. The Party will lead us to the new age. There have been those who have tried to stop the new age. They are the corrupt reminder of the past. They have tried to confuse us with the idea that the old America was a good country. We know that lie. History teaches us that lie. We are grateful to our Soviet brothers who saved the world from destruction, and we can now join them in a world of socialist brotherhood. Everyone will go to school, everyone will have a job, everyone will be equal. No one will exploit or be exploited, and all those who oppose this wonderful vision will be crushed.}}

General Samanov sums up the futility of the hypothetical Soviet domination:

{{quote|When you lose and fail, that is understandable; but when you win and fail--that brings madness.}}

== Ratings ==
The first two nights of ''Amerika'' garnered big ratings, but audience numbers dropped thereafter, and the overall miniseries averaged a 19 rating and a 29 share of American television households, compared to a 46 rating/62 share for ''[[The Day After]]''. "It wasn't as big a hit as its supporters had hoped," said [[Ted Koppel]], "but it wasn't a disaster, either." ''Amerika'' was the second-highest rated miniseries of the [[1986-87 United States network television schedule|1986–87 U.S. television season]].&lt;ref&gt;(Three or more parts.) [[TV Guide]] magazine, June 27–July 3, 1987, issue #1787. All figures are based on the [[Nielsen ratings]]. The rating represents the percentage of the 87.4 million TV households tuned to a station (sets watching this show). The share represents the percentage of TV sets tuned to a television station at the time of the broadcast (sets in use).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a 35 share reportedly had been promised to advertisers, Stoddard was happy with the performance of ''Amerika'', claiming that all or part of the miniseries had been watched by 100 million people – a ratings bonanza for ABC, then in third place among the three major networks.

== Critical reception ==

''Amerika'' received mixed reviews; the series created controversy with some.&lt;ref name="gl" /&gt; Certain critics and viewers felt it was too long and unrealistic, others argued that it would be damaging to [[Soviet-American relations]], and a spokesperson for the [[United Nations]] objected to it being portrayed as an occupying force under Soviet control.&lt;ref name="gl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="te"&gt;[[Tom Engelhardt]], "The Winds of Snore". ''[[In These Times]]'', February 11, 1987 (pp. 21,24).&lt;/ref&gt; Some conservatives felt that Soviet brutality was greatly underplayed; conversely, a number of liberals dismissed the entire miniseries as right-wing paranoia.&lt;ref name="gl" /&gt; At various points, the program was scrapped, delayed, and rewritten. Prior to the show's airing, several left-wing magazines, including ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The Progressive]]'', ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'' and ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' carried articles strongly criticizing ''Amerika''.&lt;ref name="te" /&gt; The [[American Friends Service Committee]] also protested against ''Amerika''.&lt;ref name="te" /&gt;

For its part, the Soviet Union threatened to shut down the ABC News Moscow bureau, although this threat was not carried out and indeed seemed to strengthen ABC's resolve regarding the miniseries.&lt;ref name="gl" /&gt;"We’re going to run that program come rain, blood, or horse manure," said ABC president [[John B. Sias]], after the yet-to-be-aired ''Amerika'' had generated more controversy and viewer response than any other ABC program in history, including ''[[The Day After]]''.

''Amerika'' was preceded by an ABC special addressing the considerable controversy prior to its airing (''The Storm Over Amerika''), and was followed by an "ABC News Viewpoint" panel discussion moderated by Ted Koppel, with Brandon Stoddard, Donald Wrye, and others addressing the issues along with questions and comments from a live studio audience in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].

After seeing the first episode and reading the shooting script, Tom Engelhardt stated that ''Amerika'' had "a plot line that makes suspension of disbelief into an act of grace." &lt;ref name="te" /&gt; In its summary of the [[1986-87 United States network television schedule|1986–87 US television season]], ''[[TV Guide]]'' called the miniseries "arguably the most boring miniseries in a decade," adding that "ABC's ''Amerika'' tried to hold America hostage for seven tedious nights (and a stupefyingly dull 14½ hours) by conjuring up a fuzzy vision of a Communist occupation of the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;''[[TV Guide]]'', June 27–July 3, 1987, issue #1787&lt;/ref&gt;

== Availability ==
''Amerika'' has been unseen on U.S. television since its original telecast on ABC. A [[VHS]] [[box set]] of the miniseries was released by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] in 1995, but no official [[DVD]] release is available. Portions of the soundtrack by Basil Poledouris were released on [[Compact Disc|CD]] by Prometheus Records in 2004 (in a limited edition of 3,000 copies). The [[novelization]] is widely available from used-book sellers and online auction sites. The miniseries itself can be found pirated on YouTube.

==Parodies==
In February 1987, the miniseries was parodied on the [[NBC]] show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as "Amerida," in which a debt-ridden United States is mortgaged to [[Canada]] and subsequently repossessed. It posited [[Wayne Gretzky]] as the Prime Minister of Amerida. The U.S. protagonist (played by Canadian actor [[Phil Hartman]]) longs for a country "where you don't have money that's all the colours of the rainbow" and "you can spell words like colour and flavour without a 'u'." 
To calm him down, his wife makes the offer of a beer: "How about a Labatt's, eh?"  The flag of "Amerida" was the U.S. flag with the stars replaced by a white maple leaf.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFueCN3r8SM&amp;sns=tw Amerida!], [[YouTube]], 5 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The satirical Canadian radio program ''[[Double Exposure (comedy series)|Double Exposure]]'' parodied the series in a sketch called ''Kanada with a K'', in which "[[Joe Clark|Joe Klark with a K]]" rescues the nation from "[[Ed Broadbent|Comrade Ed]]".

A '''barker channel''' is a form of [[digital signage]], operating in the form of a [[television channel]] that is entirely composed of [[sales promotion]] and [[advertising]], usually [[marketing]] various features of the service carrying the channel. The name is derived from the [[Barker (occupation)|circus barker]], who stood outside a [[circus]] and shouted to passers-by to encourage them to enter to view the entertainment being provided by the attraction.

The systems are similar to [[character generator]]s (CG), incorporating features such as [[motion graphic]]s and have the ability to play [[video clip]]s controlled by [[broadcast automation]] systems. 

==Overview==
Several barker channels exist on [[digital cable]] systems, and especially on [[direct broadcast satellite]] systems such as [[DirecTV]]. On [[interactive television]] systems, these also allow for [[Order (business)|ordering]] of [[pay-per-view]] program selections or other [[pay television]] services. Prior to its 2008 purchase by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] and subsequent conversion into a general entertainment channel (eventually leading to its rebranding as [[Pop (U.S. TV network)|Pop]] in January 2015), the TV Guide Network – along with featuring listings for upcoming programs – functioned essentially as a barker channel with film and program descriptions. During its years as [[Pop (U.S. TV network)#Prevue Guide|Prevue Guide/Channel]], it served as a barker channel outright, incorporating video [[promo (media)|program promotions]] and short-form [[trailer (promotion)|film trailers]] at the top half of the screen.

In its Prevue incarnation, the channel operated a sister barker service, [[Sneak Prevue]], which provided information on pay-per-view programming along with ordering information; the service operated until 2002 (three years after its parent network evolved into the TV Guide Channel), as a result of the rise in in-house barker channels operated by pay-per-view services to promote their content.

Barker channels are normally [[free-to-view]] or occasionally [[free-to-air]], even without a [[subscription business model|subscription]]; this also indicates success in the installation of satellite systems, and particularly in aiming small [[satellite dish]]es.

An example of a barker channel is the NBA League Pass Preview Channel, which is used to advertise and promote the [[NBA League Pass]] [[out-of-market sports package]] available to digital cable and satellite systems. In a technical form, [[specialty channel]]s focused on a single sport such as [[NBA TV]], [[NFL Network]], [[NHL Network (Canada)|NHL Network]] and [[MLB Network]] could be considered barkers, which may push devoted viewers into ordering those leagues' respective pay-per-view packages to watch complete game broadcasts.

In some occasions, the barker method is used on [[radio station]]s, looping 30 to 60 second messages leading to a pending [[radio format|format]] change, a process called "[[stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]]".

'''''Barry Butts In''''' is a 1919 Australian film comedy from director [[Beaumont Smith]] starring British vaudevillian [[Barry Lupino]], who was then visiting Australian. It is considered a [[lost film]].

==Plot==
Barry ([[Barry Lupino]]), works in a grocery store in the country. He falls in love with a beautiful young girl (Agnes Dobson) in a touring pantomime show who is the granddaughter of Barry's uncle, a wealthy man who years ago disowned the girl's mother because she married an actor. The old man requests his nephews come to Sydney so he can choose an heir. Barry's cousins try to humiliate him but he manages to triumph and inherit his uncle's fortune, and marry the girl.

From its earliest days in the African-Brazilian communities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro the genre has grown into a countrywide phenomena. Rappers, DJs, break dancers and graffiti artists are active across the complete spectrum of society blending Brazil's cultural heritage with American hip hop to form a contemporary musical fusion.

Initially Brazilian hip hop was an assertion of African-Brazilian identity and a continuation of the ethos of the 1970s Bailes Black.

Publication: Anthropological Quarterly Vol.80 (2007). Retrieved 16 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; examines the concepts of "periferia" (periphery) and "marginalidade" (marginality) in relation to hip hop identity as well as hip hop's potential pedagogical value. Pardue proposes that the common perception of hip hop as a US cultural entertainment phenomena reflecting exclusive themes of urban gang membership and masculinity may be discarded for a more realistic assessment of its educational benefits especially with regards to the young people of the favelas. Pardue cites the expansion of CEUs (Unified Educational Centers) into favelas and the employment of hip hop educationalists as examples of educational models that build upon earlier social and communal actions initiated by those from rural Brazil that settled on the outskirts of major Brazilian cities. Pardue highlights that many hip hop artists and residents from the favelas have formed educational [[NGO]]s and have actively participated in state sponsored schemes designed not only to improve the lives of those who are economically marginalized but also with a view of promoting hip hop as a positive contribution to citizenship within wider society. Pardue points out that hip hop educationalists realize the importance of hip hop and its role in the lives of the young people of the favelas and that its pedagogical value serves to benefit not only those on the periphery but also the wider aims of state education.

A '''buddy cop film''' is a film with plots involving two people of very different and conflicting personalities who are forced to work together to solve a crime and/or defeat criminals, sometimes learning from each other in the process. The two are normally either [[police officer]]s or [[secret agent]]s (''cops''), but some films that are not about two officers may still be referred to as ''buddy cop films''. It is a subgenre of [[buddy film]]s. They can be either [[comedy film|comedies]] or [[thriller film|thrillers]].

Frequently, although not always, the two heroes are of different ethnicity or cultures. However, regardless of ethnicity, the central difference is normally that one is "wilder" than the other: a hot-tempered [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] is paired with a more even-tempered partner. Often the "wilder" partner is the younger of the two, with the even-tempered partner having more patience and experience. These films sometimes also contain a variation on the [[good cop/bad cop]] [[Motif (literature)|motif]], in which one partner is kinder and law-abiding, while the other is a streetwise, "old school" police officer who tends to break (or at least bend) the rules. Another frequent plot device of this genre is placing one of the partners in an unfamiliar setting (like a different city or foreign country) or role (like requiring police field work of a non-cop, rookie, or office-bound "desk jockey").  In these cases, they are usually guided by the other partner.

In his review of ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] coined the term "Wunza Movie" to describe this subgenre, a pun on the phrase "One's a..." that could be used to describe the contrasts between the two characters in a typical film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ebert, Roger| date= September 18, 1998| title=Rush Hour | format=| work=rogerebert.com | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980918/REVIEWS/809180303/1023 | accessdate=2006-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cliché was satirized in the film ''[[Last Action Hero]]''. While the movie in itself was a buddy cop film (i.e. pairing a fictional cop with a real world boy), the film's police department obligatorily assigned all cops a conflicting buddy to work with, even to the extreme of one officer being partnered with a cartoon cat.

A subgenre of the buddy cop film is the '''buddy cop-dog movie''', which teams a cop with a [[dog]], but uses the same element of unlikely partnership to create comedic hijinks. Examples include ''[[Turner &amp; Hooch]]'', ''[[Top Dog (1995 film)|Top Dog]]'' and ''[[K-9 (film)|K-9]]''.

==History==
[[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1949 [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]] ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'', starring [[Toshiro Mifune]] and [[Takashi Shimura]], is considered a precursor to the buddy cop film genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FilmInt|journal=Film International|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y50qAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 April 2012|page=163|publisher=[[Arts Council Norway|Kulturrådet]]|location=Sweden|quote=In addition to being a masterful precursor to the buddy cop movies and police procedurals popular today, Stray Dog is also a complex genre film that examines the plight of soldiers returning home to post-war Japan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early pioneers of the buddy cop film genre are the 1967 [[Cinema of the United States|American film]] ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' and 1974's ''[[Freebie and the Bean]]''. The genre was later popularized by the 1982 film ''[[48 Hrs.]]'', starring [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Nick Nolte]], one of the most successful buddy cop films. 1987 saw the buddy cop genre reach its apex when Lethal Weapon made a theatrical debut. 1989 saw the release of ''[[Tango and Cash]]'', starring [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Kurt Russell]].

The company's site allowed customers to preview and purchase music, and chat through a proprietary client. Customers wishing to sell music through their own custom pages were required to purchase a subscription.  Subscription costs varied, and consisted of either an annual fee or an annual fee with an additional monthly charge.  These fees only allowed one to redeem sales points for BurnLounge products; participants paid additional fees if they wished to exchange earned sales points for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title="Sell music" package descriptions | publisher=BurnLounge | url=http://www.burnlounge.com | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040729222731/http://burnlounge.com/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2004-07-29 | accessdate=2006-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' article places the commission at five cents per 99-cent download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/04/03/8373063/index.htm | title=Money to Burn? | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | last=Tucker |first=Reed | date=2006-03-30 | accessdate=2006-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BurnLounge offered only music downloads, but other products such as [[audiobook]]s, video, ring tones, and physical merchandise were said to be planned.  Burnlounge 2.0 (or BL2) launched quietly on Friday, April 27, 2007.

==FTC pyramid scheme lawsuit==
[[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) filed a lawsuit on June 5, 2007 against specific BurnLounge participants for involvement in a [[pyramid scheme]]. The FTC claimed that BurnLounge is a pyramid scheme because the company pays more money for recruiting new store owners than for selling music. The lawsuit claimed that BurnLounge made very little money from the sale of music, and made the vast majority of its money from independent associates (named "moguls") paying between $29.95 and $429.95 a year plus fees, for the right to sell music. The lawsuit also stated that associates were paid a cash reward for recruiting others into the program.&lt;ref name=hull/&gt;&lt;ref name=gullo/&gt;

One person named in the lawsuit, Rob DeBoer, says that he recruited about 45 other people to open their own BurnLounge sites. Those recruited would then pay a commission on their sales to DeBoer.  DeBoer stated that he made almost US$300,000 from BurnLounge.  The lawsuit is the result of a year-long investigation into BurnLounge by the state of [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="The State"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestate.com/2010/02/28/1178735/final-chapter-yet-to-be-written.html |title=Final chapter yet to be written on Columbia cases |publisher=The State |date=2010-02-28 |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626064109/http://www.thestate.com/2010/02/28/1178735/final-chapter-yet-to-be-written.html |archivedate=June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others named in the lawsuit include former BurnLounge CEO Alex Arnold, and two Texas men who promoted BurnLounge similarly to DeBoer. The case went before a Federal Judge in December 2008, and while many of the accusations against the company were dropped by the FTC, on February 29, 2012 an order was issued barring the defendants from operating a pyramid scheme and ordering them to pay some $17 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/03/burnlounge.shtm | title=FTC Action Leads to Court Order Shutting Down Pyramid Scam Thousands of Consumers Burned by BurnLounge | date=March 14, 2012 | accessdate=March 14, 2012 | publisher=[[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/2013-04_burnloungebrief.pdf | title=Burnlounge Brief | date=April 4, 2013 | accessdate=March 18, 2014 | publisher=[[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Court ruling ===
In June 2014, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] unanimously upheld the ruling, declaring BurnLounge to be an illegal pyramid scheme.&lt;ref name=hull&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hull|first1=Tim|title=9th Circuit Affirms BurnLounge Judgment|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/06/02/68376.htm|accessdate=19 June 2014|work=Courthouse News|date=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BurnLounge was considering appeal to the Supreme Court.  Multi-level marketing analysts describe the ruling as being likely significant to an FTC investigation of [[Herbalife]]. Herbalife praised the ruling, saying that it clarified that its own business model does not fall under the appellate court's definition of pyramid scheme.&lt;ref name=gullo&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gullo|first1=Karen|title=BurnLounge Ruling in FTC Case Seen as Good for Herbalife|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-06-02/burnlounge-shutdown-by-ftc-upheld-by-federal-appeals-court|accessdate=19 June 2014|work=Bloomberg Business Week|date=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Redress ====
In June 2015, the FTC began mailing checks to consumers who had lost money in the pyramid scheme. The FTC was mailing 52,099 checks totaling almost $1.9 million.&lt;ref name="vb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ftc-pr" /&gt; The company is dormant pending additional appeals. As of November 2018, the company's website hosts a teaser promoting BurnLounge 3.0 with the statement, "Get ready", which has remained unchanged for over ten years.&lt;ref name="hull" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mullin|first1=Joe|title=How an online music pyramid scheme conned 50,000 people|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/06/how-an-online-music-pyramid-scheme-conned-50000-people/|accessdate=19 June 2015|work=Ars Technica|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''CZW Medal of Valor Championship''' is a championship contested at the [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW) training dojo.

Being a professional wrestling championship, it is not won via direct competition; it is instead won via a predetermined ending to a match. Each Medal of Valor match was a 2 out of 3 falls contest, until this stipulation was suspended by Mike Del upon his becoming champion. There have been thirteen reigns by eleven wrestlers. Conor Claxton was the first champion, who won it by defeating Ryan Galeone in a tournament final. Eran Ashe is the current champion.

The '''Cercle Funambulesque''' (1888-1898)—roughly translatable as "Friends of the Funambules"&lt;ref&gt;The ''funambule'' of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was a rope-dancer and sometimes, as in the case of [[Madame Saqui]], a mime.  But by the late nineteenth century, the word would have conjured up specifically the old [[Théâtre des Funambules]], where [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]] forged his career (see next section).&lt;/ref&gt;—was a Parisian theatrical society that produced [[Mime artist|pantomimes]] inspired by the [[Commedia dell'Arte]], particularly by the exploits of its French [[Pierrot]].  It included among its approximately one hundred and fifty subscriber-members such notables in the arts as the novelist [[J.-K. Huysmans]], the composer [[Jules Massenet]], the illustrator [[Jules Chéret]], and the actor [[Coquelin cadet]].  Among its successes was ''L'Enfant prodigue'' (1890), which was filmed twice, [[L'Enfant prodigue (film)|first]] in 1907, then in 1916, making history as the first European feature-length movie and the first complete stage-play on film.

Storey (1985), p 111.&lt;/ref&gt; created, in his celebrated mute [[Pierrot]], a legendary, almost mythic figure, immortalized by [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] in [[Marcel Carné]]'s film ''[[Children of Paradise]]'' (1945).&lt;ref&gt;Deburau reigned as the star of the Funambules from about 1825 to his death in 1846; on his pantomime, see Storey (1985), pp. 3-35.&lt;/ref&gt;  After his death, his son [[Charles Deburau|Charles]], playing at the same theater, revived for the grateful enthusiasts of the genre his father's agility and gaity;&lt;ref&gt;His tenure at the theater was, however, short-lived: he left it in 1855 (see Hugounet [1889], [https://archive.org/stream/mimesetpierrotsn00hugouoft#page/106/mode/2up/search/Charles+Deburau p. 107)].&lt;/ref&gt; and Charles's rival [[Paul Legrand]], who reinvented Pierrot as the sensitive soul so familiar to post-nineteenth-century devotees of the figure, earned warm admiration from his public (including Gautier) for his performances at the [[Folies-Nouvelles]].&lt;ref&gt;He débuted at the Funambules in the same year, 1847, as Deburau ''fils'', who soon saw him as a rival.  Legrand left for the Folies-Nouvelles in 1853, where he performed until 1859.  For a detailed account of his career, see Storey (1985), pp. 37-71, 304-305.&lt;/ref&gt;  But, by the early 1860s, interest in the pantomime, at least in the capital, had begun to flag, and both Legrand and Deburau ''fils'' had to seek out audiences elsewhere.  Deburau died young, in 1873, having taken his art to Marseille and Bordeaux, where he founded a so-called school of pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;On the founding of this school, see the [https://archive.org/stream/mimesetpierrotsn00hugouoft#page/98/mode/2up/search/Charles+Deburau section devoted to Charles Deburau in Hugounet (1889)], and also Séverin, pp. 36ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Legrand, after working in Bordeaux and abroad, found employment in the 1870s at the Tertulia, a Parisian ''café-concert'', and in the late 1880s, at the end of his career, at a children's theater, the Théâtre-Vivienne.&lt;ref&gt;See Storey (1985), pp. 71, 304-305.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both venues represented a considerable step down from the Folies-Nouvelles.  One of the historians of French pantomime, Robert Storey, writes that Legrand, in these years, "seems to have been forgotten by his public, the pantomime itself suffering death-throes at the capital while struggling for rebirth in the south of France."&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the mime made an appearance, around 1880, in a pantomime at the Variétés, he struck [[Paul Margueritte|Paul]] and [[Victor Margueritte]], rare admirers of his art, as "a survivor of a quite distant epoch."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Storey (1985), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be the self-assumed task of one of those brothers, Paul Margueritte, to revive the pantomime.  In 1882, Paul sent his just-published ''Pierrot assassin de sa femme'' (Pierrot, Murderer of His Wife), a pantomime he had devised the previous year for the audiences of his amateur theatricals in Valvins, to several writers, hoping to renew interest in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Margueritte, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  It apparently found a receptive spirit in [[Jean Richepin]], whose ''Pierrot assassin'', also a pantomime, appeared at the [[Trocadéro]] in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;  (It would hardly go unnoticed: [[Sarah Bernhardt]] was its titular Pierrot.)  And other forces were at work to promote the pantomime with the general public.  In 1879, the [[Hanlon-Lees]], a troupe of English acrobatic mimes, had performed to great acclaim at the [[Folies-Bergère]], inspiring [[J.-K. Huysmans]], the [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalistic]] novelist and future creator of the arch-aesthete [[Des Esseintes]], to collaborate on a pantomime with his friend [[:fr:Léon Hennique|Léon Hennique]].&lt;ref&gt;O.R. Morgan, "Huysmans, Hennique et 'Pierrot sceptique'", ''Bulletin de la Société J.-K. Huysmans'', No. 46 (1963), 103; cited in Storey (1985), pp. 217-218.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their [https://archive.org/details/pierrotsceptique00hennuoft ''Pierrot sceptique''] (Pierrot the Skeptic, 1881) presented its readers with a dandified Pierrot even more savage than Margueritte's or Richepin's assassin: for he not only murders his tailor and executes a mannikin he has lured to his chambers, but also sets fire to the rooms themselves to obliterate all evidence of his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;A fairly detailed synopsis in English can be found in Storey (1985), pp. 219-221.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such waggish ferocity delighted the young [[Jules Laforgue]], who, upon reading the pantomime, produced his own ''Pierrot fumiste'' (Pierrot the Cut-up, 1882), in which Pierrot is guilty of similar (if not homicidal) enormities.&lt;ref&gt;See Storey (1978), pp. 145, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these writers were refining an art that elevated Pierrot to criminal heights, others were imagining a pantomime animated by a much more conventional Pierrot.  The ''Petit Traité de pantomime à l'usage des gens du monde'' (1887), by the mime and scenarist Raoul de Najac, championed the pantomime as a recreation for the ''salons''—and reminded its readers that, in devising such an entertainment, "One must ... not forget that one is in good company."&lt;ref name="Najac"&gt;Najac (1887), p. 27; tr. Storey (1985), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;  Najac's ideal Pierrot, consequently, is innocent of all "indecent or funereal ideas,"&lt;ref name="Najac"/&gt; like those that motivate Pierrot ''sceptique''.  Such also had been the pure-hearted Pierrot of Legrand, a collection of whose pantomimes was published—in the same year as Najac's treatise—by two fraternal men of the theater, Eugène and Félix Larcher.&lt;ref&gt;Félix was at the time a drama critic; Eugène was the director of the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]]: see Storey (1985), p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  In undertaking their collaboration, the Larchers discovered talents and ambitions in themselves, vis-à-vis the pantomime, that neither knew he possessed.  Eugène, in incarnating the Pierrot of one of Legrand's pantomimes, ''Le Papillon'' (The Butterfly), found that he was a more-than-competent mime, and Félix was inspired by his brother's performance to conceive the Cercle Funambulesque.&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985), p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding, statutes, and first productions==
Through friendships and professional contacts, Félix was introduced to Najac, Paul Margueritte, and Fernand Beissier, a colleague of Margueritte's who had written the preface for ''Pierrot assassin de sa femme''.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed account of the founding of the Cercle, see Storey (1985), pp. 285-286.&lt;/ref&gt;  He persuaded them to join him as founding members of the Cercle and drew up the goals of the society.  Paul Hugounet, whom Storey calls the "most energetic publicist and chronicler" of the Cercle,&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; summarized those goals in his ''Mimes et Pierrots'' of 1889:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. To revive the classical pantomime [i.e., the pantomimes of the Deburaux and their successors].&lt;br /&gt;2. To encourage the development of the modern pantomime by providing authors and musical composers the opportunity of producing publicly their works in this genre, whatever the artistic tendencies of those works may be.&lt;br /&gt;3. To return to the stage the ''[[parade (French street entertainment)|parades]]'' and farces of the old [[Théâtre de la foire|Théâtre de la Foire]], as well as the works known as ''improvised comedies''.&lt;br /&gt;4. To present the plays of the [[Comédie-Italienne]].&lt;br /&gt;5. To stage, eventually, new comedies, in verse or in prose, on the formal condition that these works have some express relationship, in their general makeup, to the old Italian comedies or the [[Commedia dell'Arte]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugounet (1889), [https://archive.org/stream/mimesetpierrotsn00hugouoft#page/238/mode/2up/search/Cercle+Funambulesque p. 238].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Cercle grew rapidly.  By the time of its first constitutive assembly in February 1888, it boasted seventy-five members, including many of the leading celebrities of the day, among them actors ([[Paul Legrand]], [[Coquelin cadet]]), playwrights ([[Jules Lemaître]], [[Jacques Normand]], Paul Eudel, [[Félix Galipaux]]), novelists ([[Champfleury]], [[J.-K. Huysmans]], [[:fr:Léon Hennique|Léon Hennique]], [[Jean Richepin]]), painters ([[Jules Chéret]], Jules Garnier), composers ([[Jules Massenet]], [[Francis Thomé]]), and critics and historians of the theater ([[Léopold Lacour]], [[Arthur Pougin]], Edouard Stoullig).&lt;ref&gt;Hugounet (1889), [https://archive.org/stream/mimesetpierrotsn00hugouoft#page/238/mode/2up/search/Cercle+Funambulesque pp. 238-239].&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first evening of performances, in May 1888, at a small concert hall at 42, rue de Rochechouart,&lt;ref&gt;Hugounet (1889),  [https://archive.org/stream/mimesetpierrotsn00hugouoft#page/238/mode/2up/search/Cercle+Funambulesque p. 239]; [https://archive.org/stream/evolutionofpanto00levi/evolutionofpanto00levi_djvu.txt Levillain, p. 278].&lt;/ref&gt; consisted of a prologue with verses by Jacques Normand accompanied by the miming of Paul Legrand; a pantomime, ''Colombine pardonée'' (Columbine Pardoned), written by Paul Margueritte and Beissier, its Pierrot mimed by Paul himself; Najac's pantomime ''L'Amour de l'art'' (The Love of Art), with Eugène Larcher as Harlequin; and a ''parade'' of the boulevards, ''Léandre Ambassadeur'' (Ambassador Leander), starring [[Félicia Mallet]], who would later create memorable Pierrots for the Cercle.&lt;ref&gt;Hugounet (1889), [https://archive.org/stream/mimesetpierrotsn00hugouoft#page/240/mode/2up/search/Cercle+Funambulesque pp. 241-242].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m&amp;n"&gt;Storey (1985) notes that a scene from the ''théâtre-italien'' of [[Jean-François Regnard]], ''Arlequin Barbier'' (Harlequin-Barber), "was announced on the program for the first soirée, but the reviews make it clear that the piece was omitted" (p. 287, n. 11).&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all subsequent performances would be held at the small Théâtre d'Application, later called [[La Bodinière]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugounet (1889), [https://archive.org/stream/mimesetpierrotsn00hugouoft#page/238/mode/2up/search/Cercle+Funambulesque p. 239].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissentions, defections, and "the Wagnerian tradition"==

As Tristan Rémy has pointed out, "each of the promoters"—that is, the founders of the Cercle— "had personal projects, projects that were disparate, that were even opposed to one another".&lt;ref&gt;Rémy (1954), p. 212; tr. Storey (1978), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Margueritte was doubtful that any "society", such as the Cercle aspired to be, could appreciate the kinds of pantomime that he had written or wished to write.  His ideal was what he called the "Théâtre-Impossible":
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the elastic boards of a house with scenery painted by the most fervid colorists and pervaded by strains of the "enervating and caressing" music of the most suave musicians, it would charm me if, for the amusement of a few simple—or very complicated—souls, there could be presented the prodigious and tragicomic farces of life, love, and death, written exclusively by authors who had no connection whatsoever with the Society of Men of Letters.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Margueritte, "Eloge de Pierrot", ''La Lecture'', February 25, 1891; tr. Storey (1985), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Najac, on the other hand, was repulsed by Margueritte's criminal Pierrot and offended when the Cercle turned his pantomime ''Barbe-Bluette'' (Pink-Beard, 1889) into an "old melodrama rejuvenated by indecent innuendoes."&lt;ref&gt;Najac (1909), p. 38; tr. Storey (1985), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;  And, like Margueritte, he "had wanted," as Storey observes, "a close circle of associates, committed to the pantomime in a spirit of comradeship".&lt;ref name="Storey 1985, p. 287"&gt;Storey (1985), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Larchers had grander plans: as Félix told Paul Hugounet, "we wanted—still while preserving the Cercle form, such as I had sketched out in the statutes—to approximate a theatrical organization, which, in our opinion, had the only chance of succeeding."&lt;ref name="Comment"&gt;Paul Hugounet, "Comment fut fondé le Cercle Funambulesque", ''La Plume'', IV (September 15, 1892), 407; tr. Storey (1985), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Larchers' model was the [[Théâtre-Libre]] of [[André Antoine|Antoine]]—"with this difference: we resisted the intervention of amateur actors."&lt;ref name="Comment"/&gt;  Their ambitions went farther: the "conventional and unintelligible gestures of the old pantomime" were to be suppressed; the music was to follow closely the business on stage, putting "the utterance of the gesture into the orchestra"; in short, "the best theories of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]" were to be applied to the pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hugounet, "Comment fut fondé le Cercle Funambulesque", ''La Plume'', IV (September 15, 1892), 406; tr. Storey (1985), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hugounet later even went so far as to interview the composers of the Cercle on their response to "the Wagnerian tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Hugounet (1892), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  The upshot was predictable: Margueritte and Najac withdrew from the Cercle, and Margueritte's friend Beissier followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;See Storey (1985), pp. 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was an organization that was very different from what they had imagined: the Cercle strove to please its public—while encouraging its authors to embrace what was then the theatrical vanguard.  As such, it would seem to its critics both ''au-courant'' and anodyne.

==Implementation of statutes: impact of reformist tendencies and censorship==

As Larcher's words and especially his allusion to Wagner suggest, his focus was almost exclusively upon the pantomime, and his chief intention was to persuade the Cercle to "modernize" it.  Hougunet seems to have been eager to push the pantomimic envelope, but his work proved problematic.  On the one hand, there was the threat of unintelligibility, to which his pantomime ''La Fin de Pierrot'' (Pierrot's End, 1891) appears to have succumbed.  Here, true to the ideals of the [[avant-garde]] [[Symbolist movement|Symbolists]], Pierrot is urged by Hermonthis, a kind of [[Salome|Salomé]] ''à la'' [[Gustave Moreau]], to renounce the pleasures of the senses—all nourishment, love, and even life itself.  He does so and is granted the "treasure of his dreams".&lt;ref&gt;Hugounet (1891), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the reviewer of ''[[La Plume]]'', usually an ally of the Symbolists, could not make sense of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;"In this work, at least," wrote Georges Roussel, "there is an idea.  I must admit that I could not grasp it.  But a friend assured me that it was very interesting": "Critique dramatique", ''La Plume'', III (May 1, 1891), 156; tr. Storey (1985), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there was intelligible pantomimic territory into which the authors of the Cercle could not trespass.  In expanding its membership far beyond the "close circle of associates" desired by their fellow-founders, the Larchers, perhaps inadvertently, ensured that mass opinion and mass taste ruled.  The result was, inevitably, censorship, which meant that not radical modernity but a certain mediocrity prevailed.  When, for example, a jealous Pierrot disguised in a cassock sneaked into the priest's side of the confessional in ''Pierrot confesseur'' (Pierrot-Confessor, 1892), a piece by Galipaux and Pontsevrez, what Hugounet called the "terrible representatives of the Censorship of the Cercle" appointed two auditors to make cuts in the libretto and so stave off potential offense.&lt;ref&gt;Larcher and Hugounet, pp. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;  The final curtain of Hugounet's own ''Doctoresse!'' (1890)&lt;ref&gt;Written in collaboration with G. Villeneuve.&lt;/ref&gt; finds physician Isabelle (like Hermonthis, a ''[[femme fatale]]''), who has already been guilty of strangling a canary, plotting the dissection of her unfaithful husband.  Although this ending, as Félix Larcher recalled, "pleased some by its very boldness",
&lt;blockquote&gt;... the majority of us thought it impossible on the stage.  On one point everyone was in agreement: the murder of the bird, an act of coldblooded cruelty, rendered Isabelle utterly odious.&lt;ref&gt;The distance between the pantomimes of the Cercle and those of Paul Margueritte may be gauged by comparing these remarks with a scene from Margueritte's ''Au cou du chat'' (At the Cat's Neck).  Columbine has forced one of her bracelets over her pet cat's head, and, when it cannot be removed from its neck, her lover Harlequin picks up a cleaver: "The cat's head comes off like a champagne cork, and the bracelet, thrown up around a crimson fountain, goes rolling into the bloody grass."  Columbine then wipes off the bracelet on the "immaculate" blouse of the horrified bystander (and husband), Pierrot.  The pantomime appears in Paul [and Victor] Margueritte; the quotations are translations by Storey (1985), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;  The author yielded easily: he even admitted the possibility of another dénouement and, at the following meeting, he brought us the one that ends the play today.&lt;ref&gt;Larcher and Hugounet, p. 20; tr. Storey (1985), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The new version ends as a comedy: the husband and his lover, Columbine, having expired in a suicide pact, are brought back to life by one of Isabelle's electrical machines, and, as they stagger about like robots, the ''doctoresse'' reveals her new shingle: ''Resurrections My Specialty''.&lt;ref&gt;See the plot-summary in Storey (1985), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The reforms of the Cercle", writes Robert Storey, "were in fact very timid reforms.  Pathos was permissible—was, indeed, encouraged—but rarely cruelty or irreverence."&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;  And obscenity, of course, was out of the question.  This helps, in part, to explain the Cercle's ignoring two of its own statutes.  The Pierrot of [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]] often flirted with the obscene,&lt;ref&gt;See Storey (1985), p. 24, n. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gilles (stock character)|Gilles]] of the boulevard ''[[parade (French street entertainment)|parades]]'' fully reveled in it.&lt;ref&gt;See Storey (1978), pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not, therefore, surprising that, during the ten years of the Cercle's existence, it produced only one "classical" pantomime (J.-G. Deburau's ''Pierrot Coiffeur'')&lt;ref&gt;It appears as the [https://archive.org/stream/pantomimesdegasp00debu#page/n5/mode/2up opening pantomime] in the Goby collection.  Hugounet (1889) ascribes the authorship of the pantomime to J.-G. Deburau ([https://archive.org/stream/mimesetpierrotsn00hugouoft#page/242/mode/2up p. 242]), but Storey (1985) notes that the Goby collection represents Charles's pantomimes (i.e., his somewhat sanitized versions of his father's pieces) much more accurately than Jean-Gaspard's originals (p. 11. n. 25).&lt;/ref&gt; and only one ''parade'', ''Léandre Ambassadeur'',&lt;ref&gt;Appearing originally in Volume III of the anonymously published ''Théâtre des Boulevards'' of 1756, the ''parade'' is reprinted, with notes and commentary, in Spielmann and Polanz.&lt;/ref&gt; on its second and first evening of performances respectively, "when the statutes were being conscientiously observed."&lt;ref name="Storey 1985, p. 287"/&gt;  And, despite their explicit inclusion in the statutes, no plays from the Théâtre de la Foire or the Comédie-Italienne were mounted:&lt;ref name="m&amp;n"/&gt;  the theater of the past was shouldered aside by "the Wagnerian tradition".  "Modernity" reigned, in other words—but it was modernity of a rather pallid kind.  "The Cercle", writes Storey, "was, despite its intentions, the very triumph of banality."&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;  He summarizes the plots of several of its pantomimes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pierrot loses his fiancée when his "art"—of thievery—inspires him to reckless heights (Najac's ''L'Amour de l'art'' [1888]); he botches his own suicide and then, stuffing the noose in his pocket for luck, is emboldened to court Colombine ([Fernand] Boussenot's ''La Corde de pendu'' [1892]); he plays out a dream of heroic exploit that leads ''alla gloria militar'' ([Henri] Ferdal's ''La Rève du conscrit'' [1892]). ...  Sometimes his drama has a hackneyed lesson to teach: Woman is fickle (Camille de Saint-Croix's ''Blanc et noir'' [1888]); Earth's the right place for love (Beissier's ''La Lune'' [1889]). ...  Sometimes it is tearful, in the manner of the old-fashioned ''[[Comédie larmoyante|comédie-larmoyante]]''....&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985), pp. 291-292.  The titles may be translated, respectively, as ''The Love of Art'', ''The Hanged Man's Rope'', ''The Conscript's Dream'' ("''alla gloria militar''" [It. "to military glory"] is a quotation from the aria ''[[Non più andrai]]'' at the end of the first act of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Marriage of Figaro]]''),  ''White and Black'' ("Woman is fickle" is an allusion to the famous [[canzone]] ''[[La donna è mobile]]'' from the beginning of the third act of [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]''), and ''The Moon'' ("Earth's the right place for love" is a quotation from "Birches" by [[Robert Frost]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Notable achievements==

Although the Cercle left behind no enduring monuments of the theater, it provided a stage, orchestra, and audience to thirty-nine authors who, over the course of fourteen evenings of production, presented sixty-five playlets performed by and before (along with the paying public) its some hundred and fifty members.&lt;ref&gt;Rémy (1954), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;  It even had significant successes, producing pantomimes that moved to stages outside the Bodinière and even outside the country.  One of the most notable of these was ''L'Enfant prodigue'' (Pierrot the Prodigal, 1890) by [[Michel Carré (director)|Michel Carré ''fils'']], in which a provincial Pierrot, seeking his fortunes in Paris, is disabused of his illusions by the decadence of the city and of his mistress, the faithless Phrynette; he returns to his home, a prodigal, to beg the forgiveness of Mère and Père Pierrot.&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985) gives a detailed synopsis (pp. 292-293).&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only did the panto find audiences in London, at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] in 1891, and in New York, at the [[Booth Theatre]] in 1916, but it was revived in Paris in various commercial theaters well into the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985), p. 292, n. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[Laurette Taylor]] starred in a New York revival in 1925.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/evolutionofpanto00levi/evolutionofpanto00levi_djvu.txt Levillain, p. 519.]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was, moreover, instrumental in offering a footing to the fledgling art of film: Carré directed the first [[L'Enfant prodigue (film)|celluloid version]] in 1907.  Featuring the mime [[Georges Wague]] as Père Pierrot, it premièred as the first European feature-length film and the first uncut stage-play on screen.&lt;ref&gt;See Rémy (1964), pp. 122-123.  His dating of the film to 1906 is an error (repeated by Storey [1985], p. 292, n. 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cercle opened up other avenues, as well.  It both welcomed the work of mimes outside Paris, such as that of Hacks from Marseille and Mourès from Bordeaux,&lt;ref&gt;Hugounet (1889), [https://archive.org/stream/mimesetpierrotsn00hugouoft#page/244/mode/2up/search/Cercle+Funambulesque p. 245].&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed female mimes the freedom to assume male roles: [[Félicia Mallet]], "the brightest star of the Cercle", was the prodigal of ''L'Enfant prodigue''.&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985), pp. 286, 292. On female mimes in late-19th-century French pantomime, see especially Rolfe, pp. 149-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, it brought to the fore the possibilities of "modern" pantomime, sometimes arguing, through articles in the press or lectures given under the auspices of the Cercle, that the genre should dispense with its ties to the [[Commedia dell'Arte]] and venture into "realistic" territory.&lt;ref&gt;See Storey (1985), pp. 296-297, 310-311.&lt;/ref&gt;  (As early as 1889, the pantomime ''Lysic'' by Eugène Larcher had entertained the Cercle audience with a provincial maid's misadventures in Paris.)&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1985), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus did the work of the Cercle anticipate such twentieth-century creations as [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[Little Tramp]], [[Jacques Tati]]'s [[Monsieur Hulot]], [[Red Skelton]]'s Freddie the Freeloader, and [[Jackie Gleason]]'s Poor Soul.

'''Chop Socky Boom''' is an award-winning comedy web series created by Darlene Sellers and Heath Ward and filmed in [[Seattle, Washington]].  The series is broadcast on the internet and premiered on May 1, 2012. Season one includes eight episodes, with season two currently under development. Chop Socky Boom follows the adventures of misfit [[indie film]] [[actors]] cast in the fictional [[kung fu film]], “Final Zodiac Warrior.”  '''CSB''' focuses on main character Khanh and her friends, Scottie, Paige, Daisy and Max, as they audition for a poorly run [[chop socky]] series created by Trick, an [[Ed Wood]] like Director with his own unique vision.&lt;ref name="IMDB.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379647/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title=IMDB - Chop Socky Boom Full Credits |publisher= IMDB.com |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Chop Socky Boom was created by Sellers and Ward as a tribute to the adventures and misadventures of Seattle indie filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=At Stake Magazine|author=Stacey Gillard |date= August 1, 2015|title=Chop Socky Boom, a Chat with the Creators|url=  http://atstakemagazine.com/2014/08/01/chop-socky-boom-a-chat-with-the-creators-2//}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first season was funded in part through a crowdfunding campaign &lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web |url= https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1569420893/chop-socky-boom-episodes-v-viii/|title=Chop Socky Boom episodes V-VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from a small grant awarded by [[4Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web |url= http://www.4culture.org/about/past_awards/index.htm/|title=4Culture 2014 Award Recipients}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Khanh is a talented, Seattle actress working hard to find her big break. She and eleven other
local actors are cast in a new action show, “Final Zodiac Warrior.” '''FZW''' is a cross between [[Enter the Dragon]] and [[Highlander (film)|Highlander]] and features twelve warriors based on the [[Chinese zodiac]].  Portraying the signs of [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]], [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]], [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]], [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]] and [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]], Khanh and her friends survive the indie film making process, all the while doing battle with their own individual demons. Be it mistreatment from their fabulous and beautiful cast member counterparts, ambiguous direction from the director Trick, or even the threat of looming unemployment at the day job, the misfits boldly fight the [[demons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=WebVee Guide|author=Kyle Price-Livington |date= March 31, 2014|title=Chop Socky Boom Review|url=  http://webveeguide.com/reviews/2014/03/chop-socky-boom/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4819">The '''CTBF''' ('''Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund''') is the leading [[United Kingdom|UK]] charity for people working behind the scenes in the film, cinema and television industries, whose careers cover all aspects of pre-production and beyond, from script to screen and in a variety of roles. For creatives, production professionals, marketers and administration staff, the CTBF exists for those with a need and it offers financial support to those who encounter accident, illness, bereavement or unemployment. Its chief executive is Richard Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Wilson appointed CEO of CTBF|url=http://www.screendaily.com/richard-wilson-appointed-ceo-of-ctbf/5048745.article|publisher=ScreenDaily.com|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It raises money through events such as the [[Royal Film Performance]], an annual film evening attended by [[Elizabeth II|HM The Queen]] or other members of the British Royal Family, and from membership subscriptions and donations.

As well as helping those who have worked in the Film and TV industries, the CTBF also supports up and coming talent in Film and TV through the [http://www.jbawards.org.uk JBAs] (John Brabourne Awards), which provides financial assistance of between £1000 and £5000.

The '''tenth season of ''Degrassi'' ''' premiered in Canada on July 19, 2010, concluded on April 22, 2011, and consists of 44 episodes. ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation|Degrassi]]'' is a Canadian serial [[teen drama]] television series. Previously known as ''Degrassi: The Next Generation'',&lt;ref name="transgender storyline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20100715/transgender-in-degrassi-100715 |title='Degrassi' tackles transgender storyline |author=The Canadian Press |date=July 15, 2010 |work=CTV News |accessdate=July 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716194114/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20100715/transgender-in-degrassi-100715/ |archivedate=July 16, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the suffix "the Next Generation" was dropped this season, due to the original ''next'' generation of students having all been written out. With the start of the tenth season, the series has survived longer than the nine-year gap between ''[[Degrassi High]]'''s telemovie ''[[School's Out (1992 film)|School's Out]]'', and ''Degrassi''’s premiere episode "[[Mother and Child Reunion (Degrassi: The Next Generation)|Mother and Child Reunion]]".

Although only two [[Academic term#Canada|school years]] have passed in the story timeline since season six, season ten is set in the first semester, and first half of the second semester, in which the years it aired. Writers have been able to use a semi-[[floating timeline]], so that the issues depicted are modern for their viewers. This season depicts the lives of a group of high school [[Tenth grade|sophomores]], [[Eleventh grade|juniors]], [[Twelfth grade|seniors]], and [[graduate diploma|graduates]] as they deal with some of the challenges and issues that teenagers face such as [[domestic violence]], [[dysfunctional families]], [[body image|self image]], [[bullying]], [[sexual harassment]], [[gender identity]]/[[transsexualism]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[online predator]]s, [[homophobia]], [[school violence]], [[divorce]], [[religion]], [[kidney failure]], [[self-harm]], [[alcoholism]], [[sexual identity]], financial difficulties, running away and relationships.

This season doubled the order of episodes, and switched to a [[telenovela]]/[[soap opera]] format, with the show airing new episodes four days a week, for the first 24 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stohn|first=Stephen|title=Tweet 48730418761048064|url=https://twitter.com/stephenstohn/status/48730418761048064|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=March 18, 2011|date=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/03/12/2010-03-12_testing_soapy_waters_nickelodeon_to_use_degrassi_the_next_generation_to_try_out_.html#ixzz0hykkjzy5 |title=Testing soap-y waters: Nickelodeon to use 'Degrassi: The Next Generation' to try out telenovelas |author=Richard Huff |date=March 12, 2010 |work=NY Daily News |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production for the season began on March 26, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://degrassiblog.com/2010/03/06/degrassi-season-10-starts-shooting-march-26/ |title=Degrassi Season 10 Starts Shooting March 26 |date=March 6, 2010 |publisher=DegrassiBlog.com |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Epitome Pictures]]' studios in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. This was the first season not to air on [[broadcast television]]. It is also the first season to have simultaneous airings in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/stephenstohn/status/10745657024 |title=Tweet 10745657024 |author=Stephen Stohn |date=March 19, 2010 |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the earliest start to a season. In the US, the first 24 episodes of season ten were promoted as ''Degrassi: The Boiling Point'', while the final twelve episodes of the season were promoted as ''Degrassi: In Too Deep''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRF8HkKA4A |title=Degrassi: In Too Deep |publisher=TeenNick |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth Degrassi dedicated [[soundtrack]], ''[[Degrassi: The Boiling Point (Music from the Series)|Degrassi: The Boiling Point]]'', was released February 1, 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20811">'''Digital terrestrial television''' was launched in '''[[Sweden]]''' in 1999. The shutdown of the analogue equivalent started on September 19, 2005, and was finalized on October 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sverige/sista-analoga-tv-natet-slackt/|title=Sista analoga TV-nätet släckt|publisher=Sydsvenskan|language=Swedish|date=15 October 2007|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network uses the [[DVB-T]]-standard and broadcasts several free-to-air and encrypted channels on a number of multiplexes. The majority of the channels are encrypted and viewing them requires a decoding card.

==History==
On April 9, 1997, the [[Riksdag|Swedish Riksdag]] decided that digital terrestrial television (DTT) was to be introduced in Sweden. In June 1998, the government decided which channels were to broadcast in the network. The channels that received a national license were: [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]], [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]], [[C More Entertainment|Canal+]], Kunskaps-TV i Sverige (to be [[K World]]), [[TV8 (Sweden)|TV8]] and Cell Internet Commerce Development ([[eTV (Sweden)|eTV]]) in addition to [[SVT1]], [[SVT24]] and [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]]. Originally, only two multiplexes were planned and therefore [[SVT2]] was omitted. However, before the launch a third multiplex was decided on and SVT2 would be allowed to broadcast.

Two companies were created to handle the encryption services, as all channels would be encrypted: [[Senda i Sverige]] who managed the system and decoding cards and [[Boxer TV Access|Boxer]] who rented out set-top-boxes.

The digital terrestrial television network was launched on April 1, 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rtvv.se/_upload/infomatrial/4-861296215106800037407563.pdf |title=En guide till digital-TV |publisher=Swedish Radio and TV Authority |page=11 |year=2000 |isbn=91-973833-2-5 |author=redaktör: Susan Gollenia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020185450/http://www.rtvv.se/_upload/infomatrial/4-861296215106800037407563.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making Sweden the second country in Europe to launch digital terrestrial television. It then contained only [[SVT1]], [[SVT2]] and [[SVT24]]. Five regional SVT channels launched some months later.

Private companies didn't launch until the autumn when TV3, TV4, Kanal 5, TV8, K World, Canal+ and eTV launched. Canal+ were granted two extra licenses to broadcast Canal+ Gul and Canal+ Blå. Boxer started their business in the autumn.

The take-up was slow at first. When the network had been running for six months, only about 500 households had rented the necessary set-top-boxes.

New licenses were granted in January 2000. A fourth multiplex was launched in the spring. After this, the DTT network looked like this:
*MUX A: [[SVT1]], [[SVT2]], [[SVT24]] and five regional channels.
*MUX B: [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]], an extra stream from TV4, [[eTV (Sweden)|eTV]] and regional channels (Stockholm 1, NollEttan, DTU7 and Skånekanalen)
*MUX C: Canal+, Canal+ Gul, Canal+ Blå, [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]], [[K World]]
*MUX D: [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]], [[ZTV]], [[TV8 (Sweden)|TV8]], [[Viasat Film|TV1000]] and [[Viasat Sport]]

MTG said they weren't allowed to use commercial breaks in the terrestrial network. The commercial break were replaced by captions. Kanal 5 did however continue broadcasting their commercial breaks as they did on satellite. In January 2001, MTG introduced an extra fee of 115 SEK for TV3, ZTV and TV8 to cover the losses made as they didn't broadcast advertising.

In June 2001, MTG decided to cease their terrestrial broadcasts in August, which they did. As they didn't broadcast anything at all, the license was taken back, making MTG claim that they were thrown out of the DTT network.

The five MTG were replaced by other channels during the autumn of 2001: [[Discovery Channel Sweden|Discovery Channel]], [[Animal Planet Nordic|Animal Planet]], [[MTV Nordic]], [[Nickelodeon (Scandinavia)|Nickelodeon]]/[[VH1 Europe|VH1]] and [[Eurosport]]. TV4 were granted a license to broadcast [[CNN International]].

During 2002, both eTV and K World went bankrupt. The SVT regional channels were closed down and replaced by an event channel called [[SVT Extra]]. [[NonStop Television]] started broadcasting a channel called [[Star! Scandinavia|E!]] in the autumn. Senda and Boxer merged on October 1, 2002, to form the new [[Boxer TV Access]].

In December 2002, SVT launched the children's channel [[SVT Barnkanalen|Barnkanalen]] followed in February 2003 by a relaunch of [[SVT24]]. TV4 launched their first major digital channel [[Sjuan|TV4 Plus]], now Sjuan, in March.

During 2003 and 2004 the sale of set-top-boxes increased after several years of financial difficulties.

The shutdown of the analogue network was decided on in the spring of 2003.

In 2004 the launch of a fifth multiplex and more efficient compression made it possible to allow more channels to launch: [[Disney Channel (Scandinavia)|Disney Channel]], [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]], [[ZTV]], [[TV4 Film]], [[TV8 (Sweden)|TV8]], [[TCM Nordic|TCM]], [[BBC World]], [[Discovery Travel &amp; Living Europe|Discovery Travel &amp; Adventure]] and [[Showtime Scandinavia|Showtime]]. This meant that MTG returned to the DTT network. They did broadcast free-to-air for some months, but in August they decided to scramble their broadcasts. 2004 also saw the launch of [[Kunskapskanalen]] from SVT and [[Utbildningsradion|UR]]. At the end of 2004, the DTT networked looked like this:
*MUX 1: [[SVT1]], [[SVT2]], [[SVT24]], [[SVT Barnkanalen|Barnkanalen]]/[[Kunskapskanalen]] (and [[SVT Extra]])
*MUX 2: [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]], [[Sjuan|TV4 Plus]], [[Med i tv]], [[TV4 Film]], [[CNN International]] and regional channels.
*MUX 3: Canal+, Canal+ Film 1, Canal+ Film 2 Weekend Sport, [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]], [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] and [[Disney Channel (Scandinavia)|Disney Channel]]/[[Canal 7 (Sweden)|Canal 7]]
*MUX 4: [[Discovery Channel Sweden|Discovery Channel]], [[Animal Planet Nordic|Animal Planet]], [[MTV Nordic]], [[Nickelodeon (Scandinavia)|Nickelodeon]]/[[VH1 Europe|VH1]], [[Eurosport]], [[Star! Scandinavia|Star!]] and [[ZTV]]
*MUX 5: [[Discovery Travel &amp; Living Europe|Discovery Travel &amp; Living]], [[TCM Nordic|TCM]], [[BBC World]], [[Showtime Scandinavia|Showtime]] and [[TV8 (Sweden)|TV8]].

In early 2005, TV8 was moved to MUX 3 which had higher coverage than MUX 5, which at start only covered 50 percent of the households. Several changes were made to the local programmes during 2005. TV4 started making their local stations available in the digital network (previously [[TV4 Stockholm]] was shown nationwide) and SVT started providing an alternative local output so the viewer could choose to watch a neighbouring region. New regional commercial channels started: [[ByTV Jämtland]] in [[Jämtland]] and [[Kanal Lokal]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]] and [[Skåne]].

On September 19, 2005, the island of [[Gotland]] became the first region to have its analogue transmitters turned off. This continued during the autumn when the Gävle and Motala transmitters were shut down.

The fact that only the SVT channels, TV4 and the local channels were available [[free-to-air]] was a problem during the switch-off as those affected didn't feel they got enough in return for the trouble of having to buy set-top-boxes and in some cases a new antenna.

When new licenses for 2006 were pending, the Minister of Education and Culture [[Leif Pagrotsky]] stated that those broadcasters who were going to broadcast free-to-air would be more likely to receive a new license. New licenses were awarded in February 2006. This meant that:
* [[Viasat]] would be awarded a license to broadcast [[TV6 (Sweden)|TV6]] round-the-clock in MUX 2
* The newspaper [[Aftonbladet]] and [[Axel and Margaret Ax:son Johnson Foundation]] would share free-to-air one stream in MUX5. Aftonbladet would broadcast what became [[Aftonbladet TV7]] on Weekdays while [[Axess TV]] was broadcast in the weekend.
* [[SBS Broadcasting]] received one stream in MUX 4 that would be shared by [[The Voice TV Sweden|The Voice TV]] and a channel called "C 5". The Voice TV would broadcast free-to-air from 6 a.m to 6 p.m. while "C 5", renamed [[ONE Television]] at launch, would broadcast 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
* [[NonStop Television]] had to replace [[Showtime Scandinavia|Showtime]] with a new channel called "NonStop Filmfestival". It launched in May as [[Silver (TV channel)|Silver]].
* [[BBC Prime]] would broadcast one pay channel in MUX 5.
* [[Star! Scandinavia|Star!]] got its hours cut and would now broadcast in the Nickelodeon downtime from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
* [[VH1 Europe|VH1]], which was previously broadcast in the Nickelodeon downtime, would now broadcast "if space was available". Initially it did broadcast round-the-clock, but when this space was taken over by The Voice/ONE the channel disappeared. VH1 returned in June 2006, broadcasting overnight on the MTV's space.

In June 2006, SVT and TV4 did broadcast the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in [[High-definition television|high-definition]] on temporary frequencies from a few transmitters. Those frequencies were taken back when the World Cup ended.

In December 2006, the new right-wing government decided that a sixth multiplex would be taken into regular use, initially only to secure that the broadcasts of [[TV Finland]] would be secured when the transmitter of the capital region was turned off.

The Boxer monopoly on pay television was criticized by the [[European Commission]] and on October 17, 2006, it announced would be taking Sweden to the [[European Court of Justice]] as the country had failed to abolish the monopoly.

SBS Broadcasting decided to replace [[ONE Television]] with a new channel called [[Kanal 9]] in February 2007. With the launch of Kanal 9, they were allowed to adjust the Kanal 9/The Voice TV timeshare.

On May 26, 2007, [[SVT HD]] was launched on the remaining capacity of the multiplex that broadcast TV Finland, broadcasting HDTV programmes from four transmitters around the capital using MPEG-4 AVC compression.

On March 27, 2008, new broadcasts licenses were announced by the [[Swedish Radio and TV Authority|Radio and TV Authority]] (RTVV). This was the first time that the RTVV issued broadcast licenses and not government. New channels granted national licenses were [[Comedy Central Sweden|Comedy Central]], [[Discovery Science Europe|Discovery Science]], [[Jetix]], [[National Geographic Channel Scandinavia|National Geographic Channel]], [[Showtime Scandinavia|Showtime]], [[TV4 Sport]], [[Viasat Film|TV1000]] and [[Viasat Sport 1]]. In addition, new regional licenses were given to [[24nt]], [[24 Västra Götaland]], [[Borås Tidning TV]], [[Kanal 12]] and [[ST TV]] as well as [[Kanal Lokal]] in Dalarna, Gävleborg, Jämtland, Norrbotten, Västernorrland, Småland and Blekinge.

Out of the new channels, Discovery Science, National Geographic Channel, Showtime, Jetix, TV1000 and Viasat Sport 1 would be put in the new sixth national multiplex. I addition, [[BBC World]] and [[Discovery Travel &amp; Living Europe|Discovery Travel &amp; Living]] would move to this multiplex. The new multiplex would use the newer [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] compression which would allow ten channels to broadcast from one network simultaneously, as opposed to the older, less efficient, [[MPEG-2]] used by the existing multiplexes.

Some channels got new broadcasting hours. [[Axess TV]] could start broadcasting the entire week, [[Aftonbladet TV7]] and [[Canal 7 (Sweden)|Canal 7]] would timeshare so TV7 broadcast during the daytime and Canal 7 during the evening and night, [[VH1 Europe|VH1]] got to broadcast between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., [[Nickelodeon (Scandinavia)|Nickelodeon]] had its hours extended, reducing those of [[Star! Scandinavia|Star!]].

The new licenses also stipulated that TV7, [[The Voice TV Sweden|The Voice TV]] and Star! would have to move to the sixth multiplex on January 1, 2009. This makes TV7, Canal 7, [[Kanal 9]], The Voice TV and Star! to become 24-hour channels and also provides the space where Comedy Central will broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtvv.se/_upload/Nyheter/pdf/Tillst%E5nd%20att%20s%E4nda%20TV-program.pdf Tillstånd att sända TV-program]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Radio and TV Authority, March 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Droitwich transmitting station''' is a large broadcasting facility for [[longwave|long-wave]] and [[mediumwave|medium-wave]] transmissions, established in 1934 in the [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Dodderhill]], just outside the village of [[Wychbold]], near [[Droitwich]] in [[Worcestershire]], [[England]] ({{gbmapping|SO929663}}). The site is the location of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]'s most powerful long-wave transmitter, which together with the two Scottish long-wave transmitters at [[Burghead transmitting station|Burghead]] and [[Westerglen transmitting station|Westerglen]] forms a [[Single frequency network|network broadcasting on the same frequency]]. The masts can be seen to the east from the [[M5 motorway]], between Droitwich and [[Bromsgrove]], as well as to the west from the Herefordshire/Worcestershire border. At night, the two sets of [[aircraft warning lights]] are visible from a long distance. Due to the bright red lights illuminated at night, some locals have renamed the site "the devil horns of Wychbold". The station is owned and operated by [[Arqiva]].

==Technical specifications==
The long-wave frequency used was 200&amp;nbsp;kilohertz (frequently referred to by the wavelength, 1,500 metres) until 1 February 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbceng.info/Operations/transmitter_ops/Reminiscences/Droitwich/droitwich_calling.htm | title = BBCEng.Info - Droitwich Calling | accessdate = 31 January 2012 | work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was changed to 198&amp;nbsp;kilohertz, and the power is currently 500&amp;nbsp;kilowatts. The carrier frequency is controlled by a [[rubidium]] [[atomic clock|atomic frequency standard]] in the transmitter building, enabling the transmission to be used as an [[radio clock|off-air frequency standard]]. For long-wave, a [[T-aerial]] is used, which is suspended between two {{convert|213|m|ft|-high|adj=mid|sigfig=2}} guyed steel lattice [[radio masts and towers|radio masts]], which stand {{convert|180|m|ft|sigfig=2}} apart from each other. There are also two guyed [[mast radiator]]s at the site, which are used for transmitting AM medium-wave radio programmes on 693&amp;nbsp;kilohertz, 1053&amp;nbsp;kilohertz and 1215&amp;nbsp;kilohertz.

==Transmissions==
[[BBC Radio 4 Longwave]] is transmitted on 198 kHz. This signal also carries radio data encoded using [[phase modulation]], giving a time-of-day signal, and [[radio teleswitch]] control signals for [[Economy 7]] electric-heating systems.

[[BBC Radio 5 Live]] is broadcast on 693&amp;nbsp;kHz medium wave (MW), providing coverage for most of the [[Midlands (England)|English Midlands]] and [[Wales]] at a signal strength (150&amp;nbsp;kW) which is one of the strongest for that station, equal to [[Brookmans Park Transmitter|Brookmans Park]] and second only to [[Moorside Edge Transmitter|Moorside Edge]].

During [[World War II]] coded messages, read during normal programme broadcasts, were sent to the [[French Resistance]] using the transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/herefordandworcester/content/articles/2005/10/21/droitwich_transmitter_feature.shtml BBC Feature] Retrieved 29 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 as part of the [[BBC]] cuts it was announced that there would be no re-investment in [[longwave|long wave]] which may mean an eventual end to [[BBC Radio 4]] in this part of the [[radio spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15165926 BBC set to cut 2,000 jobs by 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' published a story in October 2011 saying that the transmitter relies upon a pair of glass valves, of which there are fewer than 10 left in the world, and the BBC did not believe it was safe enough to manufacture more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/09/bbc-radio4-long-wave-goodbye Radio 4's long wave goodbye]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] LW signal from Droitwich covers most of England and Wales. There are supplementary long-wave transmitters in Scotland (Burghead and Westerglen, both 50&amp;nbsp;kW), with medium-wave transmitters in various parts of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The station can also be heard clearly in most of the Republic of Ireland, particularly along eastern and southern counties. Reception is also possible in Western Europe, including Italy.

An '''editor's cut''' of a [[motion picture]] is made by the [[film editor]] on their own, or working with the [[film director]]. The editor tapes together the first cut of the film, the "editor's cut", arranging the separate takes into a coherent story according to the plan communicated by the director. The editor's version of the film will often be as much as two hours beyond the final running time of the film. Working from the editor's cut, decisions then need to be made, usually together with other creative staff, to improve continuity, balance the story, trim or delete scenes, etc.
  
A version supposedly nearer to the director's original creative vision is sometimes marketed as a ''[[director's cut]]''. These special-market versions of a movie [[DVD]] are more expensive than the regular edition, as they are usually longer than the theatre version, and have extra discs often including "making of ... " documentaries, out-take collections, extended interviews with cast and crew, etc.

'''Edward Arthur Henry Pakenham, 6th Earl of Longford''' (29 December 1902 – 4 February 1961) was an Irish [[Peerage of Ireland|peer]], [[Politics of the Republic of Ireland|politician]], and ''[[littérateur]]''. Also known as '''Eamon de Longphort''', he was a [[Members of the 5th Seanad|member]] of the fifth [[Seanad Éireann]], the upper house of the Irish Parliament, in the 1940s.

==Family and education==
Edward Longford was the elder son of [[Thomas Pakenham, 5th Earl of Longford]] and Mary, Countess of Longford, ''née'' Child-Villiers. He was the only one of the Pakenham children on whom his mother doted, apparently because he would succeed to the [[Earl of Longford|earldom]] on his father's death and because he was always in delicate health.

As a pupil at [[Eton College]] (where he twice received the Wilder Divinity Prize) he succeeded to the [[Earl of Longford|earldom]] when his father was killed in action at the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] on 21 August 1915.

He became an undergraduate at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] and met his future wife, [[Christine Longford|Christine Patti Trew]], an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[undergraduate|"undergraduette"]]. They were married on 18 July 1925. He died without issue and was succeeded by his younger brother [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Frank]].

==Politics and religion==
He was an [[Irish nationalism|Irish Nationalist]] since his days at [[Eton College|Eton]], taking inspiration from the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. He learned [[Irish language|Irish]] and adopted the name Eamon de [[Longphort]]. His political views made him unpopular at both [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], where he was famously put in "Mercury", the pond containing a statue of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] in [[Tom Quad]].

He was an [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] who never left the [[Church of Ireland]].

On 13 November 1946 he was [[Nominated members of Seanad Éireann|nominated by the Taoiseach]], [[Éamon de Valera]] as a member of [[5th Seanad|5th Seanad Éireann]], filling a vacancy caused by the death of Professor [[William Magennis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0033/S.0033.194611130004.html |title=Official Report (Seanad Éireann), Volume 33, 13 November 1946: New Senator Takes His Seat |publisher=Oireachtas |accessdate=14 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607082139/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0033/S.0033.194611130004.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not re-appointed to the [[6th Seanad]].

==Theatrical and literary activities==
Lord Longford became Chairman of the [[Gate Theatre]] in Dublin in 1930 and continued to work for the theatre until 1936, when he founded the Longford Players.

His plays include ''Ascendancy'', ''The Melians'', ''The Vineyard'', and ''Yahoo'' (about [[Jonathan Swift]]). An excellent linguist and [[Literae Humaniores|Classical]] scholar, he translated ''[[Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme]]'', ''[[Le Malade Imaginaire]]'', [[The School for Wives|''L'école des femmes'']], ''[[Tartuffe]]'', and ''[[Le Barbier de Séville]]'' (from French) and [[Agamemnon (play)#Agamemnon|''Agamemnon'']] and ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (or ''Oedipus Tyrannus'') (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]) and adapted the novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' for the stage.

He often collaborated with his wife, Christine, with whom he was also responsible for redecorating [[Tullynally Castle|Pakenham Hall]], now [[Tullynally Castle]], in [[Chinese art|Chinese]] style.

[[Tullynally Castle|Pakenham Hall]] was often the scene of gatherings of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]-educated intellectuals such as [[John Betjeman]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], and [[Maurice Bowra]].

Lord Longford also had several volumes of poetry published, some at the expense of his mother when he was still at [[Eton College|Eton]], but he is not considered to have been a very good poet.

Lord Longford is buried at [[Mount Jerome Cemetery and Crematorium|Mount Jerome Cemetery]] in Dublin.

== Education ==
Lewis is a graduate of [[Walter Payton College Prep]], and a student at [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfw.org/eva-lewis/|title=Eva Lewis - Chicago Foundation for Women|work=Chicago Foundation for Women|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Community activism ==
After the shooting of [[Trayvon Martin]], Lewis protested for the first time, marching with her mother on [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Lewis became further engaged while attending high school at Walter Payton College Prep, after attending primary school in the less-affluent, majority [[African Americans|African American]] South Side.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/meet-chicago-activist-mission-speak-out-women-everywhere-n742771|title=Young, Gifted &amp; Black: Chicago teen leads a new movement in Chicago|last=Hall|first=Mia|date=May 1, 2017|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-04-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, when she was a junior in high school, Lewis founded the non-profit The I Project. The I Project supports intersectional activism through art, with fundraising and community outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itstheiproject.com/mission.html|title=Mission|website=The I Project|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events have included a photo shoot for people of all sizes and shapes, with a discussion of culture and body image, and a screening of [[Beyoncé]]'s [[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]] with inter-generational panel discussion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In 2016, Lewis joined three other black teen women activists to organize a youth sit-in in Chicago, to protest police shootings of people of color, particularly [[Shooting of Alton Sterling|Alton Sterling]] and [[Philando Castile]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The organizers rallied young community members on [[social media]], with a [[Facebook]] event and the [[hashtag]] #BLMCHIYouth. The four organizers led a crowd of over 1,000 (some sources say 2,000)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; people in a peaceful sit-in in Millennium Park, and a march down Michigan Avenue and [[State Street (Chicago)]]. There were no arrests, a symbolic victory because of the reputation of violence in Chicago, especially among youth of color, and a strained relationship between anti-racism activists and Chicago police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/teen-activists-shut-down-chicago-streets-peaceful-blm-protest|title=Meet the Teenage Girl Who Shut Down Chicago's Streets With a #BlackLivesMatter Protest|last=Lewis|first=Eva|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the march, Lewis and the organizers started Youth for Black Lives (Y4BL) to activate youth voices against systemic oppression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With Y4BL, Lewis organized a second march beginning in Millennium Park on August 7, 2016, to protest police brutality following the death of [[Paul O'Neal]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youthforblacklives.org/projects/|title=Past Actions|website=Youth for Black Lives|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, in response to a deadly police shooting in [[Mount Greenwood, Chicago]] and racist text messages sent among students of [[Marist High School (Chicago, Illinois)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-youth-for-black-lives-meeting-met-20170117-story.html|title=Meeting with top cop sometimes frustrating for student activists|last=Cherney|first=Elyssa|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Y4BL organized another march. However, Lewis and the organizers received threats on social media, and CPS leadership contacted the organizers parents, and the march was cancelled due to safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/six-south-side-teens-spark-activism-using-social-media/|title=Six South Side teens spark activism using social media|date=2017-03-07|work=Medill Reports Chicago|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Y4BL organized meetings with [[Chicago Police Department]] Superintendent [[Eddie T. Johnson]]. The first, held on November 11, 2016, included Johnson, the Chief of Patrol, the Alderman of [[Mt. Greenwood]], and the principle of Marist High School. During the first and subsequent meetings, Lewis and the other Y4BL members questioned Johnson and discussed racism and policing in Mt. Greenwood and Chicago at large.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-youth-for-black-lives-meeting-met-20170117-story.html|title=Meeting with top cop sometimes frustrating for student activists|last=Cherney|first=Elyssa|date=January 17, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2018-04-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== United Nations ==
Through her decade of involvement with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]], Lewis participated in the [[United Nations]]’ 60th Annual [[Commission on the Status of Women]] in New York in March 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20161014/south-shore/evan-lewis-united-nations-international-day-of-the-girl|title=Chicago Teen Delivers Powerful Speech To U.N.

'''''Feature Funnies''''' was an American comic book magazine published by Comic Favorites, Inc. in the [[United States]] for 20 issues from 1937 until 1939. ''Feature Funnies'' cannily mixed color reprints of popular [[newspaper comic strip]]s like ''[[Joe Palooka]]'', ''[[Mickey Finn (comics)|Mickey Finn]]'' and ''[[Dixie Dugan]]'' with a smattering of new features.

== Publication history ==
Publisher [[Everett M. "Busy" Arnold]], deducing that [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] audiences wanted established quality and familiar [[comic strips]] for their hard-earned dimes, formed the suitably titled '''Comic Favorites, Inc.''' in collaboration with three newspaper [[syndicate]]s: the [[McNaught Syndicate]], the [[Frank J. Markey Syndicate]] and Iowa's [[Register and Tribune Syndicate]]. (Comic Favorites later became an imprint of Arnold's [[Quality Comics]], established in 1939.)

Hiring [[cartoonist]] [[Rube Goldberg]] and Goldberg's assistant, Johnny Devlin,&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Alex. [https://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2018/06/ink-slinger-profiles-by-alex-jay-johnny.html "Ink-Slinger Profiles by Alex Jay: Johnny Devlin,"] ''Stripper's Guide'' (June 11, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold in mid-1937 began publishing ''Feature Funnies'' from his office as at 389 [[Lexington Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]]. Goldberg drew many of the covers.

The new material came from comics "packagers," small studios that sprang up to produce comics on demand for publishers looking to enter the emerging comic-book field. Arnold initially bought from the quirkily named [[Harry "A" Chesler]] shop but later relied solely on [[Eisner &amp; Iger]], headed by [[Will Eisner]] and [[Jerry Iger]]. "I believe the first feature I purchased from Eisner &amp; Iger was 'Espionage' in 1938 for ''Feature Comics'' (then ''Feature Funnies'')," Arnold recalled in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="js"&gt;[[Jim Steranko|Steranko, Jim]], ''The Steranko History of Comics 2'' (Supergraphics, 1972), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Other newspaper comic strip characters in ''Feature Funnies'' included the constantly bickering [[Bungle Family]] and girl reporter [[Jane Arden (comics)|Jane Arden]].

Arnold changed the title to ''[[Feature Comics]]'' beginning with issue number 21.

A '''film''', also called a '''movie''', '''motion picture''', '''moving picture''', '''theatrical film''', or '''photoplay''', is a series of still images that, when shown on a [[Projection screen|screen]], create the illusion of moving images. (See the [[glossary of motion picture terms]].)

This [[optical illusion]] causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed in rapid succession. The process of [[filmmaking]] is both an [[art film|art]] and an [[film industry|industry]]. A film is created by [[photography|photographing]] actual scenes with a [[movie camera|motion-picture camera]], by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional [[animation]] techniques, by means of [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and [[computer animation]], or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other [[visual effects]].

The word "'''cinema'''", short for [[cinematography]], is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art of filmmaking itself. The contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences to communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribecafilm.com/future-of-film/future-of-the-movie-theater-is-in-your-mind|title=The Movie Theater of the Future Will Be In Your Mind|last=Severny|first=Andrei|date=2013-09-05|work=[[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907214603/http://tribecafilm.com/future-of-film/future-of-the-movie-theater-is-in-your-mind|archivedate=September 7, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=September 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films were originally recorded onto plastic film through a [[Photographic film|photochemical]] process and then shown through a [[movie projector]] onto a large screen. Contemporary films are now often [[Digital recording|fully digital]] through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous [[sound-on-film|optical soundtrack]] (a graphic [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] of the spoken words, music and other [[sound]]s that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected).

Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important [[art]] form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for [[documentary film|educating]]—or [[propaganda film|indoctrinating]]—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] to [[translation|translate]] the dialog into other languages.

The individual images that make up a film are called [[Film frame|frames]]. In the projection of traditional celluloid films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as [[persistence of vision]], whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called the [[phi phenomenon]].

The name "film" originates from the fact that [[photographic film]] (also called [[film stock]]) has historically been the [[Recording medium|medium]] for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including ''picture'', ''picture show'', ''moving picture'', ''photoplay'', and ''flick''. The most common term in the [[United States]] is ''movie'', while in [[Europe]] ''film'' is preferred. Common terms for the field in general include ''the big screen'', ''the silver screen'', ''the movies'', and ''cinema''; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In early years, the word ''sheet'' was sometimes used instead of ''screen''.

(Pictured here is a [[variety show]] at the theater in July 1940.)]]

===Preceding technologies===
Preceding film in origin by thousands of years, early [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[dances]] had elements common to film: [[Script (performing arts)|scripts]], [[Set construction|sets]], [[costumes]], [[Filmmaking#Production|production]], [[Film director|direction]], [[actors]], [[audiences]], [[storyboards]] and [[Film score|scores]]. Much terminology later used in film theory and criticism apply, such as [[mise en scène]] (roughly, the entire visual picture at any one time). Owing to the lack of any technology for doing so, the moving images and sounds could not be recorded for replaying as with film.

The [[magic lantern]], probably created by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the 1650s, could be used to project [[animation]], which was achieved by various types of mechanical slides. Typically, two glass slides, one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that was to move, would be placed one on top of the other and projected together, then the moving slide would be hand-operated, either directly or by means of a lever or other mechanism. Chromotrope slides, which produced eye-dazzling displays of continuously cycling abstract geometrical patterns and colors, were operated by means of a small crank and pulley wheel that rotated a glass disc.&lt;ref name="Barber, Theodore X. 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barber | first1 = Theodore X | year = 1989 | title = Phantasmagorical Wonders: The Magic Lantern Ghost Show in Nineteenth-Century America | url = | journal = Film History | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 73–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, inventions such as [[Joseph Plateau]]'s [[phenakistoscope]] and the later [[zoetrope]] demonstrated that a carefully designed sequence of drawings, showing phases of the changing appearance of objects in motion, would appear to show the objects actually moving if they were displayed one after the other at a sufficiently rapid rate. These devices relied on the phenomenon of [[persistence of vision]] to make the display appear continuous even though the observer's view was actually blocked as each drawing rotated into the location where its predecessor had just been glimpsed. Each sequence was limited to a small number of drawings, usually twelve, so it could only show endlessly repeating cyclical motions. By the late 1880s, the last major device of this type, the [[praxinoscope]], had been elaborated into a form that employed a long coiled band containing hundreds of images painted on glass and used the elements of a [[magic lantern]] to project them onto a screen.

The use of sequences of [[photography|photographs]] in such devices was initially limited to a few experiments with subjects photographed in a series of poses because the available [[photographic emulsion|emulsions]] were not sensitive enough to allow the short [[exposure (photography)|exposures]] needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving. The sensitivity was gradually improved and in the late 1870s, [[Eadweard Muybridge]] created the first animated image sequences photographed in real-time. A row of cameras was used, each, in turn, capturing one image on a [[photographic plate|photographic glass plate]], so the total number of images in each sequence was limited by the number of cameras, about two dozen at most. Muybridge used his system to analyze the movements of a wide variety of animal and human subjects. Hand-painted images based on the photographs were projected as moving images by means of his [[zoopraxiscope]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Alan Larson (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ESVZOghoi6kC&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=Eadweard%20Muybridge%20horse%20-%20english%20photographer Republic of images: a history of French filmmaking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428103430/https://books.google.com/books?id=ESVZOghoi6kC&amp;pg=PA17 |date=2016-04-28 }} Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===First motion pictures===
By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of [[celluloid]] [[photographic film]] and the invention of [[Movie camera|motion picture cameras]], which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact [[reel]] of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a "peep show" device such as the [[Kinetoscope]] and the [[mutoscope]]. Others were intended for a [[movie projector|projector]], mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these "moving pictures" could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was [[Blacksmith Scene]], produced by [[Edison Manufacturing Company]] in 1893. The following year the company would begin [[Edison Studios]], which became an early leader in the film industry with notable early shorts including [[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]], and would go on to produce close to 1,200 films.

The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American [[Woodville Latham]] and his sons, using films produced by their company, and by the – arguably better known – French brothers [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] with ten of their own productions.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham's slightly predating the Lumière brothers'.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Another opinion is that the first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in America was at [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University|Brooklyn Institute]] in [[New York City]] 9 May 1893.

===Early evolution===
The earliest films were simply one static [[Shot (filming)|shot]] that showed an event or action with no [[Film editing|editing]] or other [[cinematic technique]]s. Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several [[Scene (filming)|scenes]] together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until [[sound film]] became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely [[visual arts|visual art]], but these innovative [[silent film]]s had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a [[piano|pianist]] or [[organ (music)|organist]] or, in large urban theaters, a full [[orchestra]] to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete [[film score]]s were composed for major productions.

[[File:Charlie Chaplin, the Marriage Bond.ogg|thumb|alt=A clip from the Charlie Chaplin silent film, The Bond from 1918 Motion Picture Division of the U.S. National Archives|A clip from the [[Charlie Chaplin]] silent film ''[[The Bond]]'' (1918)]]

The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]], while the film industry in the United States flourished with the rise of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], typified most prominently by the innovative work of [[D. W. Griffith]] in [[The Birth of a Nation]] (1915) and [[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]] (1916). However, in the 1920s, European filmmakers such as [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|F. W. Murnau]] and [[Fritz Lang]], in many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through Griffith, along with the contributions of [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]] and others, quickly caught up with American film-making and continued to further advance the medium.

===Sound===
In the 1920s, the development of electronic [[sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] technologies made it practical to incorporate a [[soundtrack]] of speech, music and [[sound effects]] synchronized with the action on the screen.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The resulting [[sound film]]s were initially distinguished from the usual silent "moving pictures" or "movies" by calling them "talking pictures" or "talkies."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The revolution they wrought was swift. By 1930, silent film was practically extinct in the US and already being referred to as "the old medium."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Colour===
Another major technological development was the introduction of "[[color motion picture film|natural color]]," which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring, stencil-coloring or other arbitrary procedures, although the earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from "natural" in appearance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While the advent of sound films quickly made silent films and theater musicians obsolete, color replaced black-and-white much more gradually.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three-strip version of the [[Technicolor]] process, first used for animated cartoons in 1932, then also for live-action [[short film]]s and isolated sequences in a few [[feature film]]s, then for an entire feature film, ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'', in 1935. The expense of the process was daunting, but favorable public response in the form of increased [[box office]] receipts usually justified the added cost. The number of films made in color slowly increased year after year.

===1950s developments===
In the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North American theater attendance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed, [[widescreen]] processes, [[polarized 3D system|polarized 3D projection]], and [[stereophonic sound]] were introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule rather than the exception. Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s, but at first, they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color. During the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear. After the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid-decade, all Hollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with rare exceptions reluctantly made only at the insistence of "star" directors such as [[Peter Bogdanovich]] and [[Martin Scorsese]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===1960s and later===
The decades following the decline of the [[studio system]] in the 1960s saw changes in the production and style of film. Various New Wave movements (including the [[French New Wave]], [[Parallel Cinema|Indian New Wave]], [[Japanese New Wave]], and [[New Hollywood]]) and the rise of film-school-educated independent filmmakers contributed to the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Digital technology has been the driving force for change throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. Digital 3D projection largely replaced earlier problem-prone 3D film systems and has become popular in the early 2010s.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Film theory==
[[File:BolexH16.jpg|right|thumb|alt=16 mm spring-wound Bolex H16 Reflex camera|This [[16 mm film|16 mm]] spring-wound [[Bolex]] "H16" Reflex camera is a popular entry level camera used in [[film school]]s.]]
"Film theory" seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film as [[art]]. The concept of film as an art-form began with [[Ricciotto Canudo]]'s ''The Birth of the Sixth Art''. [[Formalist film theory]], led by [[Rudolf Arnheim]], [[Béla Balázs]], and [[Siegfried Kracauer]], emphasized how film differed from reality and thus could be considered a valid [[fine art]]. [[André Bazin]] reacted against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its differences from reality, and this gave rise to realist theory. More recent analysis spurred by [[Jacques Lacan]]'s psychoanalysis and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s [[semiotics]] among other things has given rise to [[psychoanalytic film theory]], [[structuralist film theory]], [[feminist film theory]], and others. On the other hand, critics from the [[analytical philosophy]] tradition, influenced by [[Wittgenstein]], try to clarify misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film's vocabulary and its link to a [[Form of life (philosophy)|form of life]].

===Language===
Film is considered to have its own [[language]]. [[James Monaco]] wrote a classic text on film theory, titled "How to ''Read'' a Film," that addresses this. Director [[Ingmar Bergman]] famously said, "[[Andrei Tarkovsky]] for me is the greatest [[Film director|director]], the one who invented a ''new language'', true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream." An example of the language is a sequence of back and forth images of one speaking actor's left profile, followed by another speaking actor's right profile, then a repetition of this, which is a language understood by the audience to indicate a conversation. This describes another theory of film, the [[180-degree rule]], as a visual story-telling device with an ability to place a viewer in a context of being psychologically present through the use of visual composition and editing. The "[[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood style]]" includes this narrative theory, due to the overwhelming practice of the rule by movie studios based in Hollywood, California, during film's classical era. Another example of cinematic language is having a shot that zooms in on the forehead of an actor with an expression of silent reflection that cuts to a shot of a younger actor who vaguely resembles the first actor, indicating that the first person is remembering a past self, an edit of compositions that causes a time transition.

===Montage===
{{Main|Montage (filmmaking)|l1=Montage}}
Montage is the technique by which separate pieces of film are selected, edited, and then pieced together to make a new section of film. A scene could show a man going into battle, with flashbacks to his youth and to his home-life and with added special effects, placed into the film after filming is complete. As these were all filmed separately, and perhaps with different actors, the final version is called a montage. Directors developed a theory of montage, beginning with [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] and the complex juxtaposition of images in his film ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]''.&lt;ref name=JNFilmtheory&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelmes|first=Jill|title=An introduction to film studies|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-26269-9|page=394|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jcCADouuE_UC&amp;pg=PA394&amp;q=montage|edition=3rd ed., Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporation of musical and visual [[counterpoint]], and scene development through [[mise en scene]], [[editing]], and effects has led to more complex techniques comparable to those used in [[opera]] and [[ballet]].

===Film criticism===
{{Main|Film criticism}}

Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films. In general, these works can be divided into two categories: academic criticism by film scholars and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in [[newspaper]]s and other media. Film critics working for newspapers, [[magazine]]s, and [[broadcast media]] mainly review new releases. Normally they only see any given film once and have only a day or two to formulate their opinions. Despite this, critics have an important impact on the audience response and attendance at films, especially those of certain [[film genre|genres]]. Mass marketed [[action film|action]], [[horror film|horror]], and [[comedy film]]s tend not to be greatly affected by a critic's overall judgment of a film. The plot summary and description of a film and the assessment of the director's and screenwriters' work that makes up the majority of most film reviews can still have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film. For prestige films such as most [[drama film|dramas]] and [[art film]]s, the influence of reviews is important. Poor reviews from leading critics at major papers and magazines will often reduce audience interest and attendance.

The impact of a reviewer on a given film's [[box office]] performance is a matter of debate. Some observers claim that [[movie marketing]] in the 2000s is so intense, well-coordinated and well financed that reviewers cannot prevent a poorly written or filmed [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] from attaining market success. However, the cataclysmic failure of some heavily promoted films which were harshly reviewed, as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent films indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence. Other observers note that positive film reviews have been shown to spark interest in little-known films. Conversely, there have been several films in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film. However, this usually backfires, as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a result. Journalist film critics are sometimes called film reviewers. Critics who take a more academic approach to films, through publishing in film journals and writing books about films using [[film theory]] or [[film studies]] approaches, study how film and filming techniques work, and what effect they have on people. Rather than having their reviews published in newspapers or appearing on television, their articles are published in scholarly journals or up-market magazines. They also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities as professors or instructors.

==Industry==

{{Main|Film industry}}
[[File:Filmstudio Babelsberg Eingang.jpg|thumb|alt=Babelsberg Studio near Berlin gate with pedestrian island|Founded in 1912, the [[Babelsberg Studio]] near [[Berlin]] was the first large-scale film studio in the world, and the forerunner to [[Hollywood]]. It still produces global blockbusters every year.]]
The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented. Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was in their native France, the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumières]] quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses. In each country, they would normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export, import, and screen additional product commercially. The [[Oberammergau Passion Play]] of 1898{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} was the first commercial motion picture ever produced. Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world. Dedicated [[movie theater|theaters]] and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion picture actors became major [[celebrity|celebrities]] and commanded huge fees for their performances. By 1917 [[Charlie Chaplin]] had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars. From 1931 to 1956, film was also the only image storage and playback system for [[television programming]] until the introduction of [[videotape recorder]]s.

In the United States, much of the film industry is centered around [[Hollywood, California]]. Other regional centers exist in many parts of the world, such as [[Mumbai]]-centered [[Bollywood]], the [[Cinema of India|Indian film industry's]] [[Hindi]] cinema which produces the largest number of films in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/04/07/india.sexywood/index.html Bollywood Hots Up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307024113/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/04/07/india.sexywood/index.html |date=2008-03-07 }} cnn.com. Retrieved June 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the expense involved in making films has led cinema production to concentrate under the auspices of [[movie studio]]s, recent advances in affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions to flourish.

Profit is a key force in the industry, due to the costly and risky nature of filmmaking; many films have large [[cost overruns]], an example being [[Kevin Costner]]'s ''[[Waterworld]]''. Yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting social significance. The [[Academy Awards]] (also known as "the Oscars") are the most prominent film awards in the [[United States]], providing recognition each year to films, based on their artistic merits. There is also a large industry for educational and instructional films made in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts. Revenue in the industry is sometimes volatile due to the reliance on [[blockbuster film]]s released in [[movie theater]]s. The rise of alternative home entertainment has raised questions about the future of the cinema industry, and Hollywood employment has become less reliable, particularly for medium and low-budget films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christopherson|first=Susan|date=2013-03-01|title=Hollywood in decline?

==Associated fields==
{{Further|Film theory|Product placement|Propaganda}}
Derivative academic fields of study may both interact with and develop independently of filmmaking, as in [[film theory]] and analysis. Fields of academic study have been created that are derivative or dependent on the existence of film, such as [[film criticism]], [[film history]], divisions of [[film propaganda]] in authoritarian governments, or psychological on subliminal effects (e.g., of a flashing soda can during a screening). These fields may further create derivative fields, such as a [[movie review]] section in a newspaper or a television guide. Sub-industries can spin off from film, such as popcorn makers, and film-related toys (e.g., [[Star Wars action figures|''Star Wars'' figures]]). Sub-industries of pre-existing industries may deal specifically with film, such as [[product placement]] and other [[advertising]] within films.

==Terminology==
The terminology used for describing motion pictures varies considerably between [[British and American English]]. In British usage, the name of the medium is "film". The word "movie" is understood but seldom used.&lt;ref name="britam"&gt;{{cite web|title=British English/American English Vocabulary|url=https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/british-american.htm|accessdate=26 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621191145/http://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/british-american.htm|archivedate=21 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sdope"&gt;{{cite web|title=British English vs. U.S. English – film vs. movie|url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=363802|work=Straight Dope Message Board|accessdate=26 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110091840/http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=363802|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "the pictures" (plural) is used semi-frequently to refer to the place where movies are exhibited, while in American English this may be called "the movies", but it is becoming outdated. In other countries, the place where movies are exhibited may be called a cinema or [[movie theatre]]. By contrast, in the United States, "movie" is the predominant form. Although the words "film" and "movie" are sometimes used interchangeably, "film" is more often used when considering [[artistic]], [[theoretical]], or [[technology|technical]] aspects. The term "movies" more often refers to [[entertainment]] or [[Commerce|commercial]] aspects, as where to go for fun evening on a date. For example, a book titled "How to Understand a Film" would probably be about the aesthetics or theory of film, while a book entitled "Let's Go to the Movies" would probably be about the history of entertaining movies and [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]].

Further terminology is used to distinguish various forms and media used in the film industry. "Motion pictures" and "moving pictures" are frequently used terms for film and movie productions specifically intended for theatrical exhibition, such as, for instance, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. "[[DVD]]" and "[[videotape]]" are video formats that can reproduce a photochemical film. A reproduction based on such is called a "transfer." After the advent of theatrical film as an industry, the television industry began using videotape as a recording medium. For many decades, tape was solely an analog medium onto which moving images could be either recorded or transferred. "Film" and "filming" refer to the photochemical medium that chemically records a visual image and the act of recording respectively. However, the act of shooting images with other visual media, such as with a digital camera, is still called "filming" and the resulting works often called "films" as interchangeable to "movies," despite not being shot on film. "[[Silent films]]" need not be utterly silent, but are films and movies without an audible dialogue, including those that have a musical accompaniment. The word, "[[Talkies]]," refers to the earliest sound films created to have [[Hearing (sense)|audible]] [[dialogue]] recorded for playback along with the film, regardless of a musical accompaniment. "Cinema" either broadly encompasses both films and movies, or it is roughly synonymous with film and theatrical exhibition, and both are capitalized when referring to a category of art. The "[[silver screen]]" refers to the projection screen used to exhibit films and, by extension, is also used as a [[metonym]] for the entire film industry.

"[[Widescreen]]" refers to a larger width to height in the [[film frame|frame]], compared to earlier historic [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s.&lt;ref name="imdbmovietermsw"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/W |title=Movie Terminology Glossary: W |work= |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722052010/http://www.imdb.com/glossary/W |archivedate=2010-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "feature-length film", or "[[feature film]]", is of a conventional full length, usually 60 minutes or more, and can commercially stand by itself without other films in a ticketed screening.&lt;ref name="imdbmovietermsf"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/F |title=Movie Terminology Glossary: F |work= |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722051945/http://www.imdb.com/glossary/F |archivedate=2010-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[short subject|short]]" is a film that is not as long as a feature-length film, often screened with other shorts, or preceding a feature-length film. An "[[Independent film|independent]]" is a film made outside the conventional film industry.

In US usage, one talks of a "[[Film screening|screening]]" or "[[Movie projector|projection]]" of a movie or video on a [[Projection screen|screen]] at a public or private "theater." In British English, a "film showing" happens at a [[movie theatre|cinema]] (never a "[[theatre]]", which is a different medium and place altogether).&lt;ref name="sdope" /&gt; A cinema usually refers to an arena designed specifically to exhibit films, where the screen is affixed to a wall, while a theater usually refers to a place where live, non-recorded action or combination thereof occurs from a podium or other type of stage, including the amphitheater. Theaters can still screen movies in them, though the theater would be retrofitted to do so. One might propose "going to the cinema" when referring to the activity, or sometimes "to the pictures" in British English, whereas the US expression is usually "going to the movies." A cinema usually shows a mass-marketed movie using a front-projection screen process with either a film projector or, more recently, with a digital projector. But, cinemas may also show theatrical movies from their home video transfers that include Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and videocassette when they possess sufficient projection quality or based upon need, such as movies that exist only in their transferred state, which may be due to the loss or deterioration of the film master and prints from which the movie originally existed. Due to the advent of [[digital cinema|digital film production and distribution]], physical film might be absent entirely. A "[[double feature]]" is a screening of two independently marketed, stand-alone feature films. A "viewing" is a watching of a film. "[[Sales]]" and "at the box office" refer to tickets sold at a theater, or more currently, rights sold for individual showings. A "[[Film release|release]]" is the distribution and often simultaneous screening of a film. A "[[preview (theatre)|preview]]" is a screening in advance of the main release.

Any film may also have a "[[sequel]]", which portrays events following those in the film. ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' is an early example. When there are more films than one with the same characters, story arcs, or subject themes, these movies become a "series," such as the [[James Bond]] series. And, existing outside a specific story timeline usually, does not exclude a film from being part of a series. A film that portrays events occurring earlier in a timeline with those in another film, but is released after that film, is sometimes called a "[[prequel]]," an example being ''[[Butch and Sundance: The Early Days]]''.

The "credits," or "end credits," is a list that gives credit to the people involved in the production of a film. Films from before the 1970s usually start a film with credits, often ending with only a title card, saying "The End" or some equivalent, often an equivalent that depends on the language of the production{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. From then onward, a film's credits usually appear at the end of most films. However, films with credits that end a film often repeat some credits at or near the start of a film and therefore appear twice, such as that film's acting leads, while less frequently some appearing near or at the beginning only appear there, not at the end, which often happens to the director's credit. The credits appearing at or near the beginning of a film are usually called "titles" or "beginning titles." A [[post-credits scene]] is a scene shown after the end of the credits. ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' has a post-credit scene in which Ferris tells the audience that the film is over and they should go home.

A film's "cast" refers to a collection of the actors and actresses who appear, or "star," in a film. A star is an actor or actress, often a popular one, and in many cases, a [[celebrity]] who plays a central character in a film. Occasionally the word can also be used to refer to the fame of other members of the crew, such as a director or other personality, such as [[Martin Scorsese]]. A "crew" is usually interpreted as the people involved in a film's physical construction outside cast participation, and it could include directors, film editors, photographers, grips, gaffers, set decorators, prop masters, and costume designers. A person can both be part of a film's cast and crew, such as [[Woody Allen]], who directed and starred in ''[[Take the Money and Run]]''.

A "film goer," "movie goer," or "film buff" is a person who likes or often attends films and movies, and any of these, though more often the latter, could also see oneself as a student to films and movies or the filmic process. Intense interest in films, film theory, and film criticism, is known as [[cinephilia]]. A film enthusiast is known as a cinephile or cineaste.

===Preview===
{{main|Test screening}}
A preview performance refers to a showing of a film to a select audience, usually for the purposes of corporate promotions, before the public film premiere itself. Previews are sometimes used to judge audience reaction, which if unexpectedly negative, may result in recutting or even refilming certain sections based on the [[audience response]]. One example of a film that was changed after a negative response from the test screening is 1982's ''[[First Blood]]''. After the test audience responded very negatively to the death of protagonist [[John Rambo]], a [[Vietnam veteran]], at the end of the film, the company wrote and re-shot a new ending in which the character survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/bp/first-blood-turns-30-rambo-original-dark-end-174610790.html|title='First Blood' Turns 30: Rambo's original dark end|location=[[Yahoo!

===Trailer and teaser===
{{main|Film trailer}}

Trailers or previews are advertisements for films that will be shown in 1 to 3 months at a cinema. Back in the early days of cinema, with theaters that had only one or two screens, only certain trailers were shown for the films that were going to be shown there. Later, when theaters added more screens or new theaters were built with a lot of screens, all different trailers were shown even if they weren't going to play that film in that theater. Film studios realized that the more trailers that were shown (even if it wasn't going to be shown in that particular theater) the more patrons would go to a different theater to see the film when it came out. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film program. That practice did not last long because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film (or the "A film" in a [[double feature]] program) begins. Film trailers are also common on [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Trailers are created to be engaging and interesting for viewers. As a result, in the Internet era, viewers often seek out trailers to watch them. Of the ten billion videos watched online annually in 2008, film trailers ranked third, after news and user-created videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | title = AWFJ Opinion Poll: All About Movie Trailers | publisher = AWFJ | date = 2008-05-09 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011641/http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | archivedate = 2013-12-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teasers are a much shorter preview or advertisement that lasts only 10 to 30 seconds. Teasers are used to get patrons excited about a film coming out in the next six to twelve months. Teasers may be produced even before the film production is completed.

==Education and propaganda==
{{Main|Educational film|Propaganda film}}

Film is used for a range of goals, including education and propaganda. When the purpose is primarily educational, a film is called an "[[educational film]]". Examples are recordings of academic lectures and experiments, or a film based on a classic novel. Film may be [[propaganda film|propaganda]], in whole or in part, such as the films made by [[Leni Riefenstahl]] in Nazi Germany, US war film trailers during World War II, or artistic films made under Stalin by [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]. They may also be works of political protest, as in the films of [[Andrzej Wajda]], or more subtly, the films of [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]. The same film may be considered educational by some, and propaganda by others as the categorization of a film can be subjective.

== Production ==
{{Main|Filmmaking}}

At its core, the means to produce a film depend on the content the filmmaker wishes to show, and the apparatus for displaying it: the [[zoetrope]] merely requires a series of images on a strip of paper. Film production can, therefore, take as little as one person with a camera (or even without a camera, as in [[Stan Brakhage]]'s 1963 film ''[[Mothlight]]''), or thousands of actors, extras, and crew members for a live-action, feature-length epic.

The necessary steps for almost any film can be boiled down to conception, planning, execution, revision, and distribution. The more involved the production, the more significant each of the steps becomes. In a typical [[production cycle]] of a Hollywood-style film, these main stages are defined as [[Script development|development]], [[pre-production]], [[Film production|production]], [[post-production]] and [[Film distributor|distribution]].

This production cycle usually takes three years. The first year is taken up with ''development''. The second year comprises ''preproduction'' and ''production''. The third year, ''post-production'' and ''distribution''. The bigger the production, the more resources it takes, and the more important [[Film budgeting|financing]] becomes; most [[feature film]]s are artistic works from the creators' perspective (e.g., [[film director]], [[cinematographer]], [[screenwriter]]) and for-profit business entities for the production companies.

===Crew===
{{Main|Film crew}}

A film crew is a group of people hired by a film company, employed during the "production" or "photography" phase, for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture. ''Crew'' is distinguished from ''cast'', who are the [[actor]]s who appear in front of the [[camera]] or provide voices for characters in the film. The ''crew'' interacts with but is also distinct from the ''production staff'', consisting of producers, managers, company representatives, their assistants, and those whose primary responsibility falls in pre-production or post-production phases, such as [[screenwriter]]s and [[film editor]]s. Communication between ''production'' and ''crew'' generally passes through the director and his/her staff of assistants. Medium-to-large crews are generally divided into departments with well-defined hierarchies and standards for interaction and cooperation between the departments. Other than acting, the crew handles everything in the photography phase: props and costumes, shooting, sound, electrics (i.e., lights), sets, and production special effects. [[Caterer]]s (known in the film industry as "craft services") are usually not considered part of the crew.

===Technology===
{{see also|Cinematic techniques}}
[[Film stock]] consists of transparent [[celluloid]], [[acetate]], or [[polyester]] [[film base|base]] coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals. Cellulose nitrate was the first type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials. Stock widths and the [[film format]] for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] prints.
Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked [[movie camera|cameras]] and [[movie projector|projectors]]; though 1000 frames per minute (16{{sfrac|2|3}} frame/s) is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates most films were shot between 16 frame/s and 23 frame/s and projected from 18 frame/s on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_car_1.htm |title=Silent Film Speed |publisher=Cinemaweb.com |date=1911-12-02 |accessdate=2010-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407224839/http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_car_1.htm |archivedate=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sound film]] was introduced in the late 1920s, a constant speed was required for the sound head. 24 frames per second were chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} Improvements since the late 19th century include the mechanization of cameras&amp;nbsp;– allowing them to record at a consistent speed, quiet camera design&amp;nbsp;– allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large "blimps" to encase the camera, the invention of more sophisticated [[film stock|filmstocks]] and [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], allowing [[Film director|directors]] to film in increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action. The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action pictures, many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously.

As a medium, film is not limited to motion pictures, since the technology developed as the basis for [[photography]]. It can be used to present a progressive sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow. Film has also been incorporated into [[multimedia]] presentations and often has importance as primary historical documentation. However, historic films have problems in terms of preservation and storage, and the motion picture industry is exploring many alternatives. Most films on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films. Some studios save color films through the use of [[separation masters]]: three B&amp;W negatives each exposed through red, green, or blue filters (essentially a reverse of the [[Technicolor]] process). Digital methods have also been used to restore films, although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them (as of 2006) a poor choice for long-term preservation. [[Film preservation]] of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and archivists and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in order to make them available to future generations (and thereby increase revenue). Preservation is generally a higher concern for nitrate and single-strip color films, due to their high decay rates; black-and-white films on safety bases and color films preserved on Technicolor imbibition prints tend to keep up much better, assuming proper handling and storage.

Some films in recent decades have been recorded using [[analog (signal)|analog]] [[video]] technology similar to that used in [[television production]]. Modern [[Digital video|digital video cameras]] and [[digital projector]]s are gaining ground as well. These approaches are preferred by some film-makers, especially because footage shot with [[digital cinema]] can be evaluated and edited with [[non-linear editing system]]s (NLE) without waiting for the film stock to be processed. The migration was gradual, and as of 2005, most major motion pictures were still shot on film.{{update after|2015|6|3}}

===Independent===
{{Main|Independent film}}
[[File:Fratelli Lumiere.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Auguste and Louis Lumière brothers seated looking left|[[Auguste and Louis Lumière|The Lumière Brothers]], who were among the first filmmakers]]
Independent filmmaking often takes place outside Hollywood, or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or indie film) is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major film studio]]. Creative, business and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century. On the business side, the costs of big-budget studio films also lead to conservative choices in cast and crew. There is a trend in Hollywood towards co-financing (over two-thirds of the films put out by [[Warner Bros.]] in 2000 were joint ventures, up from 10% in 1987).&lt;ref name="VARIETY_2003"&gt;{{cite web|first=Meredith|last=Amdur|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VR1117895718&amp;categoryid=10|title=Sharing Pix is Risky Business|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2003-11-16|accessdate=June 23, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915040337/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VR1117895718&amp;categoryid=10|archivedate=September 15, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hopeful director is almost never given the opportunity to get a job on a big-budget studio film unless he or she has significant industry experience in film or television. Also, the studios rarely produce films with unknown actors, particularly in lead roles.

Before the advent of [[digital cinematography|digital]] alternatives, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce, direct, or star in a traditional studio film. But the advent of consumer [[camcorder]]s in 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of high-resolution [[digital video]] in the early 1990s, have lowered the technology barrier to film production significantly. Both production and post-production costs have been significantly lowered; in the 2000s, the hardware and software for post-production can be installed in a commodity-based [[personal computer]]. Technologies such as [[DVD]]s, [[FireWire]] connections and a wide variety of professional and consumer-grade [[video editing software]] make film-making relatively affordable.

Since the introduction of digital video [[DV]] technology, the means of production have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot a film with a digital video camera and edit the film, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a high-end home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent filmmakers rely on [[film festival]]s to get their films noticed and sold for distribution. The arrival of internet-based video websites such as [[YouTube]] and [[Veoh]] has further changed the filmmaking landscape, enabling indie filmmakers to make their films available to the public.

===Open content film===
{{Main|Open content film}}

An open content film is much like an independent film, but it is produced through open collaborations; its source material is available under a [[license]] which is permissive enough to allow other parties to create [[fan fiction]] or derivative works, than a traditional copyright. Like independent filmmaking, open source filmmaking takes place outside Hollywood, or other major [[studio system]]s.

===Fan film===
{{Main|Fan film}}

A fan film is a film or video inspired by a film, [[television program]], [[comic book]] or a similar source, created by [[fan (aficionado)|fans]] rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been [[amateur]]s, but some of the most notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to rarer full-length motion pictures.

==Distribution==
{{Main|Film distribution|Film release}}

Film distribution is the process through which a film is made available for viewing by an [[audience]]. This is normally the task of a professional [[film distributor]], who would determine the marketing strategy of the film, the media by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing, and may set the [[film release|release date]] and other matters. The film may be exhibited directly to the public either through a [[movie theater]] (historically the main way films were distributed) or [[television]] for [[home video|personal home viewing]] (including on [[DVD-Video]] or [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]], online [[download]]ing, [[television program]]s through [[broadcast syndication]] etc.). Other ways of distributing a film include rental or personal purchase of the film in a variety of media and formats, such as [[VHS]] tape or [[DVD]], or [[Internet]] [[download]]ing of [[streaming media|streaming]] using a computer.

==Animation==
{{Main|Animation}}
[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.9|An animated image of a horse, made using eight pictures.]]
Animation is a technique in which each frame of a film is produced individually, whether generated as a computer graphic, or by photographing a drawn image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see [[claymation]] and [[stop motion]]), and then photographing the result with a special [[animation camera]]. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second, there is an illusion of continuous movement (due to the [[phi phenomenon]]). Generating such a film is very labor-intensive and tedious, though the development of [[computer animation]] has greatly sped up the process. Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for [[Television|TV]] and films comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of [[independent animation]] has existed at least since the 1950s, with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.

[[Limited animation]] is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using "short cuts" in the animation process. This method was pioneered by [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and popularized by [[Hanna-Barbera]] in the [[United States]], and by [[Osamu Tezuka]] in [[Japan]], and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from [[movie theater]]s to [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6193603.stm|title= Hanna Barbera's golden age of animation|accessdate= 2007-01-25|last= Savage|first= Mark|date= 2006-12-19|work= |publisher= BBC News|pages= |language= |deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061219211006/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6193603.stm|archivedate= 2006-12-19|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most animation studios are now using digital technologies in their productions, there is a specific style of animation that depends on film. Camera-less animation, made famous by film-makers like [[Norman McLaren]], [[Len Lye]], and [[Stan Brakhage]], is painted and drawn directly onto pieces of film, and then run through a projector.

'''Groundshare''' is the principle of sharing a stadium between two local sport teams. This is usually done for the purpose of reducing the costs of either construction of two separate facilities and related maintenance.&lt;ref name="main"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/tottenham/article2821147.ece Main Article]-Main Article&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of groundshare==

===Intersport Groundshares===
Given sufficient compatibility between facility requirements, two teams that do not play the same sport may share a ground or a stadium. North American indoor arenas commonly feature [[basketball]] and [[ice hockey]] teams sharing the facility during their common fall-to-spring season; a layer of insulation and a basketball floor can easily be laid over or removed from the hockey rink, and dasherboards disassembled or reconfigured, in a matter of hours.  Historically [[baseball]] and [[American football]] teams often shared a large general-purpose outdoor or domed stadium, particularly during the [[multi-purpose stadium]] era of the 1960s-1990s, despite the dissimilarity of their fields.&lt;ref name="main" /&gt; This practice fell out of fashion in the 1990s as baseball teams constructed highly specialized stadia in which football fields fit awkwardly if at all.  Football teams in turn built more specifically rectangular stadia, often with a floor slightly wider than American football requirements to comfortably accommodate domestic or international soccer as American spectator interest in that sport grew.

A variation on the groundshare concept exists commonly within the [[NBA]] and the [[NHL]].  As the requirements for a regulation NHL hockey rink and a regulation NBA basketball court do not differ significantly, in the majority of cases where a metropolitan area has both an NBA and an NHL franchise, the teams share the same arena.

===Intrasport Groundshares===
This is two teams that play the same sport share the same ground. These may be two non-competing teams who play at different levels, such as [[Bury F.C.]], renting [[Gigg Lane]] to [[F.C. United of Manchester]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name="main" /&gt;

===Intraleague Groundshare===
This is where two teams in the same league share the same ground, such as the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]] sharing [[MetLife Stadium]].

In the American [[NBA]], only two franchises share one arena: both the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] share [[Staples Center]].

'''Hip-hop theater''' is a form of theater that presents contemporary stories through the use of one or more of the four elements of hip-hop culture—[[b-boying]], [[Graffiti#Modern graffiti|graffiti]] writing, [[rapping|MCing]] (rapping), and [[Turntablism|DJing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4183762 | title = Will Power, Telling Stories through 'Hip Hop Theatre' | website = [[NPR]] | publisher = The Tavis Smiley Show | host = Tavis Smiley | date = November 23, 2004 | accessdate = October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mania&gt;{{cite news|last=Hopkins |first=Philip |title=Hip-Hop Takes the Stage |work=Theater Mania |date=June 3, 2003 |url=http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm?int_news_id=3579 |accessdate=November 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/628apiFhB?url=http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm?int_news_id=3579 |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |quote='Everyone has a different definition of how hip-hop applies to theater,' says Valentin, who published the hip-hop-culture-focused Stress Magazine before becoming involved as a producer with some of the genre's bigger names. According to Valentin, 'Every show doesn't necessarily have to include the four basic elements of hip-hop: a DJ, graffiti-based visual art, breakdancing, and an MC or rapper.' But he concurs with Forbes about the importance of 'the language on stage, the story, and the vibe,' adding that 'relevance to today's world, urban or otherwise, is a major part' of the hip-hop theater experience. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cultural markers of [[hip-hop]] such as [[performance poetry|spoken word]], [[beatboxing]], and [[hip-hop dance]] can be included as well although they are not always present.

Hip-hop theater productions appear in a wide range of platforms including single performances, week-long festivals, and traveling [[Theatre#Repertory companies|repertory]] companies. [[Marc Bamuthi Joseph]] is an award-winning [[spoken word]] poet and dancer who has been commissioned several times to create and direct single hip-hop theater works. [[British people|British]] choreographer Jonzi D is the artistic director of the London-based Breakin' Convention, a week long hip-hop theater festival. [[Rennie Harris]], Mourad Merzouki, and Victor Quijada are artistic directors who run hip-hop theater companies in the U.S., France, and Canada respectively. The Rock Steady Crew, Magnificent Force, and the Rhythm Technicians pioneered this theatrical genre which started in the United States.

==History==
Though hip-hop culture has managed to establish itself on film, on television, in fashion, in music, and in the dance industry, it has not gained the same momentum in theater.

The series is well received, and is the first non-variety sketch show on the site to make it past a first season.&lt;ref name="Weband1"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://theweband1.blogspot.com/2009/08/i-3-vampires-episodes-1-17.html | title = I &lt;3 Vampires (episodes 1-17) | date = 2009-08-14 | work = [[The Web and 1]] | accessdate = 2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show, like many on the site, takes fan submissions and integrated them into each episode.

==Plot==
The show is a parody of the fandom that surrounds popular vampire franchises like ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]''.

===Season One===
Corbin and Luci, two best friends, run "I &lt;3 Vampires" - a fansite for their favorite book, ''Confessions of a High School Vampire'', for which Corbin makes daily [[vlogging|vlogs]] regarding the book series. When Luci receives an anonymous e-mail containing the first six chapters of the upcoming book in the ''Confessions'' series (derived from the online leak of part of the fifth [[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]] book, [[Midnight Sun (Stephenie Meyer novel)|Midnight Sun]]), the best friends are so excited that Corbin posts the chapters on "I &lt;3 Vampires" without thinking about the consequences. When the books' author, Siona McCabre, learns that chapters of her new book have been leaked, and announces that she has halted the publication of the book indefinitely, Corbin and Luci take it upon themselves to find Siona and apologize, hoping that Siona will continue with the book's publication. With the help of Corbin's annoying neighbour, Wyatt, the three go on a quest to find Siona, which proves to be more difficult - and much more complicated - than they had originally thought.

===Season Two===
A year ago, Corbin and Luci found out that their favorite book, ''Confessions of a High School Vampire'', was more real than they ever could have imagined. Now the two are no longer friends, and have abandoned "I &lt;3 Vampires," the fansite they created for ''Confessions''. They have also broken up with their supernatural boyfriends, Nick and Wyatt, and so Corbin is surprised when Siona McCabre, author of ''Confessions'' and mother to Corbin's ex-boyfriend Nick, asks Corbin to help her find Nick, who has been missing for several weeks. Corbin refuses. Three days later, Corbin learns that Siona has been killed, and so she makes her first vlog since abandoning "I &lt;3 Vampires," in which she apologizes for leaving the fansite without an explanation. Corbin then goes missing, and it's up to her college roommate, ''Confessions'' fan Sam, to reunite Luci and Wyatt so that the three of them can find Corbin together.

==Hiatus and Series Future==
At the conclusion of the second season there was not any news on whether or not there would be a third season. Cherilyn Wilson and Alli Kinzel later stated in a YouTube video that there would not be another season coming in the foreseeable future as they have not been contacted about continuing the series, despite high fan demand.&lt;ref name="season3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcYeg8Ob510|title=corbin and sam vlog again |author=Alli Kinzel|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 15, Josh Nuncio announced on Twitter that both seasons with cast commentary and alternate endings would be available on [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/JoshDNun/status/81112553031352321|title=I&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;3Vampires fans we just finished filming the new cast commentary and both season will soon be available at Amazon with alternative endings|author=Josh Nuncio|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=June 15, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601081210/https://twitter.com/JoshDNun/status/81112553031352321#|archive-date=2014-06-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
In 2011 [[Disney Publishing Worldwide]] published ''I Heart Vampires: Birth (A Confessions of a High School Vampire Novel)'' which was written by Siona McCabre. It is the same book that Corbin and Luci read in the series. The book is about the student Noah Vance who discoveres two bite marks in a morning after a high school party. He realizes that he is turning into a vampire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/i-heart-vampires-siona-mccabre/1113019032?ean=9781423167686 |title=I Heart Vampires: Birth (A Confessions of a High School Vampire Novel) [NOOK Book] |publisher=barnesandnoble.com |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''It's Bad for Ya''''' is the 19th album, and 14th and final [[HBO]] [[stand-up comedy]] special by stand-up comedian [[George Carlin]]. It was televised live on March 1, 2008, on HBO, less than four months before Carlin died of [[heart failure]] at age 71.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/events/george-carlin/index.html ''HBO: George Carlin: IT'S BAD FOR YA'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The album is the follow-up to the 2005 HBO special ''[[Life Is Worth Losing]]''. Carlin worked on this material since ending his ''Life Is Worth Losing'' tour. The working title for this show was ''The Parade of Useless Bullshit''. 

Filmed in the [[Luther Burbank Center for the Arts|Wells Fargo Center for the Arts]] in [[Santa Rosa, California]], the show's stage behind Carlin was designed to represent a cozy living room theme. The CD was released July 29, 2008, and the DVD and Blu-ray Disc on November 25, 2008.

''It's Bad for Ya'' received the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]], awarded posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE5171UA20090208 |title=Comedian George Carlin wins posthumous Grammy |date=February 8, 2009 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kazem El-Solh''' (1904 – 25 December 1976) was a Lebanese politician, a diplomat and the founder of a political party and a newspaper. He was a member of parliament in Lebanon and served as the country's ambassador to Iraq. He hails from a prominent [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]] family which gave Lebanon four prime ministers, his brother [[Takieddine Solh]], as well as [[Riad Solh]], [[Sami as-Solh|Sami Solh]] and [[Rachid Solh]]. The Solh family is originally from the ancient port city of [[Sidon]] in southern Lebanon.

==Career==
Kazem El-Solh served as Lebanese Ambassador in Baghdad from 1947 to 1960, leaving Iraq a year after the coup ousting the Hashemite monarchy in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lebanon and Arabism |publisher=Raghid el-Solh, I.B. Tauris Publishers |date= 2004|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=49z7AFqIE2IC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=kazem+solh+ambassador+iraq&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=44hRqnrKx6&amp;sig=Xf5cMa3_RJIZ30Ezad-PXy80RAw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWn8zvyZHbAhXBtBQKHVd7CxcQ6AEIPjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=kazem%20solh%20ambassador%20iraq&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960-1964, he was a member of the [[Lebanese Parliament]], representing the eastern region of [[Zahle]]. He was also the head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee.
Prior to that, Kazem El-Solh was a staunch activist for Arab nationalism and the region's independence from foreign powers. He also established the Arab Nationalist Party in 1935.

In 1936, El-Solh wrote a paper during the Coastal Conference, published later, and which was the precursor to Lebanon's [[National Pact]], promoting Lebanese coexistence. His paper is generally considered as one of the foundations of the Lebanese Constitution and it’s citizen’s charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Actualité du manifeste de Kazem el-Solh en 1936 |publisher=L'Orient Le Jour |date=April 18, 2008 |url=https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/587924/Actualite_du_manifestede_Kazem_el-Solh_en_1936%252AProfesseur_Antoine_MESSARRA.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943-1947, he set up a law practice in downtown Beirut and in 1944-1960 he formed a political party called Al Nida, together with other prominent intellectuals and his brother [[Takieddin el-Solh]], who later became prime minister.

===''Al Nida''===
In 1930, he was the founding owner of the daily newspaper Al Nida (The Appeal) in Beirut, to which his brothers contributed articles.

==Personal life==
Kazem El-Solh was born in 1904, in Beirut. He attended the [[International College, Beirut]], then studied at the Jesuit School, also in Beirut, before graduating with a law degree from the University of Damascus. 
In 1934, he married his first cousin Yesser Kamel El-Solh. They had four children: Hannah, Khaldoun, Nawal and [[Raghid El-Solh]].
He died on December 25, 1976.

A '''limerick''' is a form of verse, almost always humorous and sometimes rude, in five-line, predominantly [[Anapaest|{{H:title|Two short, unstressed syllables followed by one long stressed syllable.|anapestic}}]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cuddon|first1=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|date=1999|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0140513639|page=458|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[meter (poetry)|meter]] with a strict [[rhyme scheme]] of AABBA, in which the first, second and fifth line rhyme, while the third and fourth lines are shorter and share a different rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBJAAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=limerick&amp;pg=PR3-IA3|title=Limerick Lyrics|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following example is a limerick of unknown origin:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
The limerick packs laughs anatomical
Into space that is quite economical.
: But the good ones I've seen
: So seldom are clean 
And the clean ones so seldom are comical.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Leonard. ''The Secret of Humor''. Rodopi, 1978. {{ISBN|9789062033706}}. p102&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The form appeared in England in the early years of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;An interesting and highly esoteric verse in limerick form is found in the diary of the Rev. [[John Thomlinson]] (1692–1761):

''1717. Sept. 17th. One Dr. Bainbridge went from Cambridge to Oxon [Oxford] to be astronomy professor, and reading a lecture happened to say'' de Polis et Axis, ''instead of'' Axibus.'' Upon which one said, Dr. Bainbridge was sent from Cambridge,—to read lectures'' de Polis et Axis; ''but lett them that brought him hither, return him thither, and teach him his rules of syntaxis.''
From ''Six North Country Diaries'', Publications of the [[Surtees Society]], Vol. CXVIII for the year MCMX, p. 78. Andrews &amp; Co., Durham, etc. 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized by [[Edward Lear]] in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; although he did not use the term. [[Gershon Legman]], who compiled the largest and most scholarly anthology, held that the true limerick as a folk form is always obscene, and cites similar opinions by [[Arnold Bennett]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]],&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1988, pp. x-xi.&lt;/ref&gt; describing the clean limerick as a "periodic fad and object of magazine contests, rarely rising above mediocrity". From a folkloric point of view, the form is essentially transgressive; violation of taboo is part of its function. 

==Form==
[[File:Hercules &amp; Waggoner2.jpg|thumb|An illustration of the [[Aesop's Fables|fable]] of ''Hercules and the Wagoner'' by [[Walter Crane]] in the limerick collection "Baby's Own Aesop" (1887)]]

The standard form of a limerick is a stanza of five lines, with the first, second and fifth rhyming with one another and having three [[Foot (prosody)|feet]] of three [[syllables]] each; and the shorter third and fourth lines also rhyming with each other, but having only two feet of three syllables. The defining "foot" of a limerick's meter is usually the [[anapaest]], (''ta-ta-TUM''), but [[catalexis]] (missing a weak syllable at the beginning of a line) and extra-syllable rhyme (which adds an extra unstressed syllable) can make limericks appear [[amphibrach]]ic (''ta-TUM-ta'').

The first line traditionally introduces a person and a place, with the place appearing at the end of the first line and establishing the rhyme scheme for the second and fifth lines. In early limericks, the last line was often essentially a repeat of the first line, although this is no longer customary.

Within the genre, ordinary speech stress is often distorted in the first line, and may be regarded as a feature of the form: "There ''was'' a young ''man'' from the ''coast'';" "There ''once'' was a ''girl'' from De''troit''…" Legman takes this as a convention whereby [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]] is violated simultaneously with propriety.&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1988, p. xliv.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation of geographical names, especially exotic ones, is also common, and has been seen as invoking memories of geography lessons in order to subvert the decorum taught in the schoolroom; Legman finds that the exchange of limericks is almost exclusive to comparatively well-educated males, women figuring in limericks almost exclusively as "villains or victims". The most prized limericks incorporate a kind of twist, which may be revealed in the final line or lie in the way the rhymes are often intentionally tortured, or both. Many limericks show some form of [[internal rhyme]], [[alliteration]] or [[assonance]], or some element of [[word play]]. Verses in limerick form are sometimes combined with a [[refrain]] to form a [[limerick (song)|limerick song]], a traditional humorous [[drinking song]] often with obscene verses.

David Abercrombie, a phonetician, takes a different view of the limerick, and one which seems to accord better with the form.&lt;ref&gt;Abercrombie, David, ''Studies in Phonetics and Linguistics'' 1965 Oxford University Press: Chapter 3 ''A Phonetician's View of Verse Structure''.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is this: Lines one, two, and five have three feet, that is to say three stressed syllables, while lines three and four have two stressed syllables.  The number and placement of the unstressed syllables is rather flexible.  There is at least one unstressed syllable between the stresses but there may be more – as long as there are not so many as to make it impossible to keep the equal spacing of the stresses.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name ''limerick'' for this type of poem is debated. The name is generally taken to be a reference to the [[Limerick|City]] or [[County Limerick|County of Limerick]] in Ireland&lt;ref&gt;Loomis 1963, pp. 153–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5LNhn_LKo4|title=Siar sna 70idí  1973 Lios Tuathail - John B Keane, Limericks, Skinheads|work=YouTube|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes particularly to the [[Croom, County Limerick|Maigue Poets]], and may derive from an earlier form of [[nonsense verse]] parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included "Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?"&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "come to Limerick" is known in American Slang since the Civil War, as documented in the ''Historical Dictionary of American Slang'' and subsequent posts on the American Dialect Society List. One meaning for the phrase, proposed by Stephen Goranson on ADS-list, would be a reference to the Treaty of Limerick, and mean ''surrender'', ''settle'', ''get to the point'', ''get with the program''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently,{{when|date=February 2015}} the first known usage in England was from 1898 (''[[OED|New English Dictionary]]'') and in the United States from 1902, but in recent years several earlier examples have been documented, the earliest being an 1880 reference, in a [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune,&lt;ref&gt;reported by Stephen Goranson on the ADS-list and in comments at the Oxford Etymologist blog&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;

who drew but a very small salary.
: When he went to the show,
: his purse made him go

==Edward Lear==
[[Image:1862ca-a-book-of-nonsense--edward-lear-001.jpg|thumb|''A Book of Nonsense'' (ca. 1875 James Miller edition) by [[Edward Lear]]]]

The limerick form was popularized by [[Edward Lear]] in his first ''Book of Nonsense'' (1846) and a later work, ''More Nonsense, Pictures, Rhymes, Botany, etc''. (1872). Lear wrote 212 limericks, mostly considered [[nonsense literature]]. It was customary at the time for limericks to accompany an absurd illustration of the same subject, and for the final line of the limerick to be a variant of the first line ending in the same word, but with slight differences that create a nonsensical, circular effect. The humour is not in the "punch line" ending but rather in the tension between meaning and its lack.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, Wim. "The Limerick: The Sonnet of Nonsense?". ''Explorations in the Field of Nonsense''. ed. Wim Tigges. 1987. page 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is an example of one of Edward Lear's limericks.
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
There was a Young Person of Smyrna
Whose grandmother threatened to burn her.
: But she seized on the cat,
: and said 'Granny, burn that!
You incongruous old woman of Smyrna!'
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

Lear's limericks were often typeset in three or four lines, according to the space available under the accompanying picture.

==Variations==

[[File:Haptic limerick.jpg|thumb|"Amstaff named Yoko from Zgierz" haptic limerick by Witold Szwedkowski as an example of [[haptic poetry]]]]

The limerick form is so well known that it has been parodied in many ways. The following example is of unknown origin:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
There was a young man from Japan
Whose limericks never would scan.
: And when they asked why,
: He said "I do try!
But when I get to the last line I try to fit in as many words as I can."
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

Other parodies deliberately break the rhyme scheme, like the following example, attributed to [[W.S. Gilbert]]:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
There was an old man of St. Bees,
Who was stung in the arm by a wasp,
: When asked, "Does it hurt?"
: He replied, "No, it doesn't,
I'm so glad it wasn't a hornet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA683|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells 1903, pp. xix-xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

Comedian [[John Clarke (satirist)|John Clarke]] has also parodied Lear's style:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
There was an old man with a beard,
A funny old man with a beard
: He had a big beard
: A great big old beard
That amusing old man with a beard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/02/craig-brown-lost-diaries-parody|title=Craig Brown: The Lost Diaries|work=the Guardian|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

The British wordplay and recreational mathematics expert [[Leigh Mercer]] (1893–1977) devised the following mathematical limerick:
:&lt;math&gt;	\frac{12 + 144 + 20 + 3 \sqrt{4}}{7} + (5 \times 11) = 9^2+0&lt;/math&gt;
This is read as follows:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
A [[dozen]], a [[Gross (unit)|gross]], and a [[20 (number)|score]]
Plus three times the square root of four
: Divided by seven
: Plus five times eleven
Is nine squared and not a bit more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/mayhem.htm |title=Math Mayhem |publisher=Lhup.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4319">The '''London Opera Glass Company''' was officially formed in [[London]], [[England]] on 20 May 1913 to produce [[opera glasses]] for theatres in London.&lt;ref name="company-info"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.companiesintheuk.co.uk/ltd/the-london-opera-glass-company | title=The London Opera Glass Company Limited | work=Companies in the UK | accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Team2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Quiz Team|title=The Only Quiz Book You Will Ever Need|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJl-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT177|date=9 October 2014|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4735-1764-6|pages=177–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's purpose was to offer fashionable [[theatre]] goers in London's [[West End (London)|West End]], technology that had started in [[Vienna]] and [[Paris]] in the 19th century. Opera glasses were not new at the time of the company's formation. In fact they were a fashion accessory at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. It was not until 1912 that the London Opera Glass Company installed discrete dispensers on the backs of seats, enabling patrons to rent them for 6d (2{{frac|1|2}}p in today's money).

Since the formation of the company, around 11 million patrons have used its opera glasses to view theatre productions such as [[Noël Coward]]'s comic play ''[[Hay Fever]]'' in 1925 and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' musical by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. In 2009, two major London theatres, the [[Comedy Theatre]] and the [[Savoy Theatre]], installed £1 opera glasses from the company throughout their auditoriums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs085/1101966345958/archive/1102666739235.html |title=Two famous London theatres get Opera Glasses in time for new productions |work=Theatre Views Newsletter | date=Summer 2009 | accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Asof|October 2011}}, around 1.8 million people have used the company's opera glasses at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] during performances of the ''[[Lion King (musical)|Lion King]]'' since it opened in October 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs085/1101966345958/archive/1107747364051.html | title=1.8 million views of Lion King | work=Theatre Views Newsletter | date=October 2011 | accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''long poem''' is a literary genre including all [[poetry]] of considerable length.  Though the definition of a long poem is vague and broad, the genre includes some of the most important poetry ever written.

With more than 220000 (100000 [[shloka]] or couplets) verses and about 1.8 million words in total, the ''[[Mahābhārata]]'' is the longest [[epic poetry|epic poem]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Spodek|Spodek, Howard]]. Richard Mason. The World's History. Pearson Education: 2006, New Jersey. 224, 0-13-177318-6&lt;/ref&gt; It is roughly ten times the size of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' combined, roughly five times longer than Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', and about four times the size of the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]''. 

In English, ''[[Beowulf]]'' and [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' are among the first important long poems. The long poem thrived and gained new vitality in the hands of experimental [[Modernism|Modernists]] in the early 1900s and has continued to evolve through the 21st century.

The long poem has evolved into an umbrella term, encompassing many subgenres, including [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[verse novel]], verse narrative, [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] sequence, lyric series, and [[collage]]/[[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]]. 
==Definitions==

===Length and meaning===
Lynn Keller describes the long poem as being a poem that is simply "book length," but perhaps the simplest way to define "long poem" is this: a long poem is long enough that its bulk carries meaning.  Susan Stanford Friedman describes the long poem as a genre in which all poems that are not considered to be short can be a considered a part. These overly inclusive definitions, though problematic, serve the breadth of the long poem, and have fueled its adaptation as a voice for [[cultural identity]] among [[Marginalization|marginalized persons]] in [[History of poetry#Modern developments|Modern]] and [[Contemporary poetry]].  Only a broad definition can apply to the genre as a whole. In general, a poem is a "long poem" when its length enhances and expands upon the thematic, creative, and formal weight of the poem.

Though the term "long poem" may be elusive to define, the term is now finally getting the attention it deserves.  The genre has gained importance both as a [[literary form]], and as a means of collective expression. Lynn Keller solidifies the genre's importance in her essay, "Pushing the Limits," by stating that the long poem will always be recognized as a notable genre of importance in early twentieth-century [[American literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keller|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==

===Tale of the tribe===

A long poem often functions to tell a "tale of the tribe," or a story that encompasses a whole culture's values and history.  Ezra Pound coined the phrase, referring to his own long poem ''The Cantos.''  The long poem's length and scope can contain concerns of a magnitude that a shorter poem cannot address. The poet may see himself or herself as the "bearer of the light," to use Langston Hughes' term, who leads the journey through a culture's story, or as the one who makes known the light already within the tribe. The poet may also serve as a poet-prophet with special insight for their own tribe.

In Modern and Contemporary long poems the "tale of the tribe" has frequently been retold by culturally, economically, and socially marginalized persons.  Thus, pseudo-epic narratives, such as Derek Walcott's "Omeros," have emerged to occupy voids where post colonial persons, racially oppressed persons, women, and other people who have been ignored by classic epics, and denied a voice in the prestigious genre.

===Revisionary mythopoesis===

Various poets have undertaken a "revisionary mythopoesis" in the long poem genre.  Since the genre has roots in forms that traditionally exclude poets who have minimal cultural authority, the long poem can be a "fundamental re-vision," and function as a discourse for those poets (Friedman).  These "re-visions" may include neglected characters, deflation of traditionally celebrated characters, and a general reworking of standards set by the literary tradition. This revision is noted especially by feminist critical work that analyzes how women are given a new voice and story through the transformation of a previously "masculine" form.

===Cultural commentary===

Lynn Keller notes that the long poem enabled modernists to include sociological, anthropological, and historical material.  Many long poems deal with history not in the revisionary sense but as a simple re-telling in order to prove a point.  Then there are those who go a step further and recite a place's or people's history in order to teach.  Like revisionary mythopoesis, they may attempt to make a point or demonstrate a new perspective by exaggerating or editing certain parts of a history.

==Concerns and controversies==

===Fears of the writer===

Long poem authors sometimes find great difficulty in making the entire poem coherent and/or deciding on a way to end it or wrap it up. Fear of failure is also a common concern, that perhaps the poem will not have as great an impact as intended. Since many long poems take the author's lifetime to complete, this concern is especially troubling to anyone who attempts the long poem. [[Ezra Pound]] is an example of this dilemma, with his poem ''The Cantos''.&lt;ref name="Keller 1993"&gt;Keller 1993&lt;/ref&gt; As the long poem's roots lie in the epic, authors of the long poem often feel an intense pressure to make their long poems the defining literature of the national identity or the shared identity of a large group of people. The American long poem is under pressure from its European predecessors, revealing a special variety of this anxiety. [[Walt Whitman]] tried to achieve this idea of characterizing the American identity in ''[[Song of Myself]]''. Thus, when the author feels that their work fails to reach such a caliber or catalyze a change within the intended audience, they might consider the poem a failure as a whole.

Poets attempting to write a long poem often struggle to find the right form or combination of forms to use. Since the long poem itself cannot be strictly defined by one certain form, a challenge lies in choosing the most effective form.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generic conundrums===

'''Inclusivity'''

The long poem has been considered a problematic genre for women writers. Its roots in epic make the genre appear to be non-inclusive of female writers. This is due to the epic's long history of being primarily a realm of writing for men.&lt;ref name="Friedman 1990"&gt;Friedman 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lyric intensity'''

Some critics, most emphatically [[Edgar Allan Poe]], consider poetry as a whole to be more closely tied to the lyric.  They complain that the emotional intensity involved within a lyric is impossible to maintain in the length of the long poem, thus rendering the long poem impossible or inherently a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Poe 1850&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article "The long poem: sequence or consequence?" Ted Weiss quotes a passage from M. L. Rozenthal and Sally M. Gall's "The Modern Poetic Sequence" inspired by Poe's sentiments, "What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely a succession of brief ones.... It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such, only inasmuch as it intensely excites, by elevating, the soul; and all intense excitements are, through a psychal-necessity, brief. For this reason, at least one half of the Paradise Lost is essentially prose—a succession of poetical excitements interspersed, inevitably,with corresponding depressions—the whole being deprived, through the extremities of its length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity, of effect. In short, a poem to be truly a poem should not exceed a half hour's reading. In any case, no unified long poem is possible."&lt;ref&gt;Weiss 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multivocality'''

One genre theory claims that once a poem takes on multiple voices, it becomes a novel.  Many long poems do make use of multiple voices, while still maintaining all the element of a poem, and therefore cause even more confusion when trying to define their genre.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

'''Naming and subgenres'''

Critic Lynn Keller also expresses concerns about the genre in her essay "Pushing the Limits." Keller states that because of the debate over and prevalence of subgenres and forms within the overarching genre of long poem, critics and readers tend to choose one subgenre, typically the epic form, as being the "authentic" representative form of the genre. Therefore, this causes the other equally important subgenres to be subject to criticism for not adhering to the more "authentic" form of long poem.&lt;ref name="Keller 1997 p"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keller|1997|p=???}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics of the long poem sometimes hold the belief that with long poems, there is no "middle ground."  They view long poems as ultimately being either epics or lyrics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Many critics refer to the long poem by various adjective-filled subgenre names that often are made of various components found within the poem. These can lead to confusion about what a long poem is exactly. Below you will find a list describing the most common (and agreed upon) subgenre categories.&lt;ref name="Keller 1993"/&gt;

==Advantages of the genre==
{{Refimprove|date=June 2009}}
The long poem genre has several advantages over prose and strictly lyric poetry.  The most obvious difference between the long poem and other literary genres is the sheer difficulty of composing a long work entirely in verse.  Poets who undertake the long poem face the serious problem of creating a work that is consistently poetic, sometimes taking strict forms and carrying them through the whole poem.  However, the poets who do choose the long poem turn this liability into an advantage—if a poet can write a long poem, they prove themselves to be worthy.  The very difficulty gives the genre an implicit prestige.  Long poems have been among the most influential texts in the world since Homer.  By writing a long poem, a poet participates in this tradition and must prove their virtuosity by living up to the tradition. As discussed below, the traditionally difficult long poem's prestige can be revised to serve radical purposes.

Additional benefits of the long poem:

*The long poem provides the artist with a greater space to create great meaning.
*A long poem allows the author to be encyclopedic in their treatment of the world, as opposed to the potentially narrow focus of the lyric.
*A long poem poet can work on a long poem their entire life, weaving in their impressions gleaned from the span of several generations (and historical events); it can be an ongoing work.
*A long poem can encapsulate not just traditional poetry, but incorporate dialogue, prose passages, and even scripting.
*A reader can absorb an entire world view from a long poem.

==Female authors in the genre==

Critic Lynn Keller voices the concerns of female poets writing within the genre of the long poem.  In her essay "Pushing the Limits", she discusses the long poem in regards to its female contributors, a group often forgotten or marginalized in favor of the more privileged white male author. Not only does Keller discuss women and their place in the authorship of the long poem, but she also talks about the tendency of the genre to forget authors who are not white and male, therefore leaving out minority writers, foreign writers, and writers of different sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Keller 1997 p"/&gt;

Keller explains the long poem as being a "generic hybrid".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keller|1997|p=??}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this, Keller means that the form, in large part because of its indefinable nature, gives authors creative leeway to mold and form the genre of long poem to fit their creative needs. The long poem's flexibility should not only be open to include women and minority writers, but should be a haven in which these writers can use their writing to voice their identity, a primary topic for the long poem genre.

As stated above in "Concerns and Controversies", many female writers have felt that they have no place within the long poem genre because of its epic roots. The epic is a historically masculine genre and has not welcomed female writers or other authors who are not male and white. The long poem is often understood as the epic reborn, making it seem like a genre inaccessible to women. Women who did participate within the long poem and epic forms were often highly criticized or overlooked until recently, as there has been increasing interest in such authors as H.D.

Keller also discusses a primary critic of the long poem, Kamboureli, in her essay. Kamboureli's stance is that long poem's readers and contributors should not preference one form of long poem over another. To extend this idea, it is also equally important to say that one type of author within this genre should not be privileged over another. The textual "betweeness", an idea coined by Kamboureli and discussed in Keller's essay, provides a place where writers can create their art in a genre that is by its nature less restrictive than other poetic forms.  This lack of restriction should be the very reason that the genre should be open to all.  Its hybridisms and variety will only be enhanced by the presence of women and other writers.

Keller states that this new perspective on long poem and reexamination of forgotten long poems has revived the form as a realm of possibilities for upcoming female writers. Female writers are seeing the long poem as a genre that should not only be open and inclusive to them, but also as a genre that theoretically could benefit the female writer as much if not more than the male writers the form previously favored. Women writers are now able to combat the "dominant traditions" at play within the long poem genre to mold the genre into their own, creating what critic Susan Friedman terms a "re-vision" of the form.

[[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] was one of the first female authors to attempt an epic poem.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In her article "Written in blood: the art of mothering epic in the poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning", Olivia Gatti Taylor explores Browning's attempt to write an authentically feminine epic poem titled ''Aurora Leigh''. Taylor posits that Browning began this process with the structure of her poem, "While earlier epics like the ''[[Aeneid]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' have twelve books, [[Aurora Leigh]] was conceived as a nine-book epic; thus, the very structure of the work reveals its gestational nature. According to Sandra Donaldson, Barrett Browning's own experience at age forty-three of "giving birth and nurturing a child" greatly influenced her poetry "for the better", deepening her "sensitivity".

==Genealogy==

The most important "parent genre" to the long poem is the [[Epic poetry#cite note-0|epic]].  As stated on the page of the main article on the epic, "An epic is a lengthy, revered narrative poem, ordinarily concerning a serious subject containing details of heroic deeds and events significant to a culture or nation."  The term "long poem" includes all the generic expectations of epic and the reactions against those expectations.  Many long poem subgenres share characteristics with the epic, including: telling the tale of a tribe or a nation, quests, history (either recitation or re-telling in order to learn from the past), a hero figure, or prophecies.

Other subgenres of the long poem include lyric sequence, series, collage, and verse-novel.  What unites each of these subgenres under the heading of long poem is that their length has importance in their meaning. Each subgenre, however, is unique in its style, manner of composition, voice, narration, and proximity to outside genres.

Sequence poetry uses the chronological linking of poems to construct meaning, as each lyric builds on the poems previous to it.  Examples include [[Louise Glück]]'s ''The Wild Iris'', and older sonnet cycles, such as [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[Astrophel and Stella]]'' or [[Dante]]'s ''[[Vita Nuova]]''.  Serial lyrics similarly depend on the juxtaposition and dialogue between individual lyrics to build a greater depth of meaning. Narrative poems rely heavily on

Often, these subgenres are blended, blurred or overlapped to create second-generation subgenres. The blurring between the lines of the subgenres is what makes the long poem so hard to define, but it also marks the growing creativity in the use of the form.

==Subgenres==

===Epic===

[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|right|The first page of the Beowulf manuscript. Beowulf was one of the first long poems in English.]]
Critic Joseph Conte describes the [[Epic poetry|epic]] as a long poem that "has to have grand voice and purpose. . . it has to say something big."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conte|1992|p=??}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn Keller describes one of the epic's aspects as including a "quasi-circular quest-journey structure" that she says is present in the long poem ''Song of Myself'' by Whitman.  Yet that long poem, Keller notes, does not have a "specified end toward which the poem or speaker is directed," unlike a more traditional long poem.  Though long poems do have roots in the epic form, that does not mean long poems that are epic-like are completely epic.  A second example of long poems distancing themselves from the traditional epic form is seen in ''Helen In Egypt'' by H.D.  Though traditional epics feature physical quests or journeys, ''Helen In Egypt'' is about the psychological journey of Helen.

Other characteristics of the epic include a hero figure, myths, and quests for the characters. Many such characteristics are seen in various long poems, but with some changes.  For example, ''Helen In Egypt'' brings mythic revision, or revisionary mythopoesis, into play. Even though it includes the myth from the epic, the revised telling of the myth makes the long poem stand out as its own form.  Additionally, one cannot look at the epic as a single, unified form of inspiration for long poems.  As Keller points out, certain long poems can have roots in very specific epics instead of the overall epic category.

The long poem ''Omeros'' by Derek Walcott has drawn mixed criticism on whether it should or should not be tied to the traditional epic form.  Those against that idea say that the poem's story is not as important as those found in traditional epics.  ''Omeros'' tells the tale of fishermen in the Caribbean fighting over and lusting after a waitress instead of a typically heroic tale of battles and quests.  On the other side of the argument lies the point that it is important to keep in mind that ''Omeros'' has ties to the epic genre, if only as a contrast.  By putting more simple characters in the forefront as opposed to warriors, Walcott revises the traditional epic form, which these critics say is something to notice as opposed to cutting off ''Omeros'' from any ties to the epic whatsoever.  Furthermore, these critics say that one cannot ignore the epic influence on the poem since its characters' names are taken from Homer.  In ''Omeros'' there are distinct elements obviously influenced by traditional epics, such as a trip to the underworld, talk of a muse, etc.

In interviews, Walcott has both affirmed and denied that ''Omeros'' is tied to the epic form.  In one interview he stated that it was a type of epic poem, but in another interview he said the opposite, stating as part of his evidence that there are no epic-like battles in his poem.  In ''Omeros'' Walcott implies that he has never read Homer, which is probably untrue based on the character names derived from Homer. Walcott's denial of his poem being tied too heavily to the epic form may stem from his concern that people might only think of it as being an epic-influenced poem instead of transcending the epic genre.

Based on this criticism of ''Omeros'' it is clear that the generic identity of a long poem greatly contributes to its meaning.  Because long poems are influenced by many more strictly defined genres, a long poem revising strict generic rules creates striking contrast with epic-genre expectations.

Keller also notes that she agrees with critic Susan Friedman when Friedman expresses her concern that the long poem associated with the epic has been "the quintessential male territory whose boundaries enforce women's status as outsiders on the landscape of poetry."  Considering that there are many long poem authors that are women, one cannot fully associate the long poem with the epic genre.

However, the typical exclusion of women in the epic tradition is for many female authors what makes the long poem an appealing form for laying cultural claim to the epic.

Control of or at least inclusion in the creation of a cultural epic is important because the traditional epic poem like ''The Odyssey'' or Virgil’s ''Aeneid'' is, at its core, a written history. Written history defines the good and the bad of a culture, the winners and losers, and the author of that history controls the very future by manipulating the knowledge of later generations. For Friedman to deny epic associations to the long poem because they are sometimes written by women is to counter the efforts of many female long poets.

If the long poem is considered an epic or invokes an epic in its length as many critics and readers aver then breaching its traditional exclusivity by using the epic to tell the story of marginalized peoples such as women rather than the victors is essentially an opportunity for the poet to rewrite history. Walcott’s ''Omeros'' is an excellent example of a long poem recording the untold history of a marginalized people.

Likewise H.D.’s revision of the story of Helen of Troy in ''Helen'' is an attempt to exonerate women from the blame of the Trojan War. In this sense, form inexorably serves the function and meaning of the poem by indicating to the reader that the poem is, if not an epic, epic-like and therefore a history. For some female authors using the well known form of an epic is a way to legitimize their stories, but by slightly altering the epic tradition they also indicate that the traditional way is unacceptable and insufficient for their purposes. Embodying the modernist dilemma, the long poem as epic often contains the seeming belief in the futility of tradition and history paired with the obvious dependence on them.

===Lyric sequence===

A lyric sequence is a collection of shorter lyric poems that interact to create a coherent, larger meaning. The lyric sequence often includes poems unified by a theme. A defining characteristic of this subgenre is that each lyric enhances the meaning of the other lyrics in the work, creating an enhanced collective metaphor, that opens the lyric sequence to unique adaptations of dialogue and other narrative/theatrical characteristics.
	
Critic Lynn Keller lends some insight to the lyric sequence by placing it in opposition to the epic: “At the opposite end of the critical spectrum are the treatments of the long poem that do not consider issues of quest, hero, community, nation, history and the like, and instead regard the form as essentially lyric.

===Lyric series===

The lyric series is a genre of poetry in which the seriality of short (but connective) lyric poems enhances the long poem's meaning. Seriality may contribute narrative coherence or thematic development, and it is often read in terms of the poem's productive process, i.e. how the poem "produces its own experience"(Shoptaw). Each lyric poem is distinct and has meaning in itself, yet it functions as an integral part of the series, giving it a greater meaning as within the long poem as well.

Deborah Sinnreich-Levi and Ian Laurie examine the work of Oton de Grandson in the lyric series, or "ballad series" form.  Grandson wrote several sets of short love lyrics, using the series form for narrative coherence and thematic construction, as well as to examine different aspects of a single narrative.  George Oppen's ''Discrete Series'' relates its poetic seriality to the mathematic concept of a discrete series.  Langston Hughes' ''Montage of a Dream Deferred'' qualifies as a serial lyric as well as a montage.

===Collage/Montage===

The best-known and most highly regarded example of a collage long poem is [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]''. Critic Philip Cohen describes Eliot's use of the collage in his article "The Waste Land, 1921: Some Developments of the Manuscript's Verse":

"Eliot gradually created a more modernist poem, one which resembles a cubist collage: [[satiric narrative]]s were abandoned in favor of first of [[dramatic poetry]] and then of a bold amalgamation of genres. The speakers shifted from omniscient narrators to a variety of separate-person voices and then to different voices of one shadowy character."{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The collage combines seemingly disparate parts or "fragments" of different voices, pieces of mythology, popular song, speeches, and other utterances in an attempt to create a somewhat cohesive whole.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The best known Bengali long poem is JAKHAM (The Wound) written by [[Malay Roy Choudhury]] of India during the famous [[Hungryalist]] movement in 1960s.

A montage is similar to a collage in that it consists of many voices, most famously portrayed in [[Langston Hughes]]' ''[[Montage of a Dream Deferred]]''. The poet provides a comprehensive portrait of 20th century [[Harlem]] through the use of numerous different voices and thus creates a cohesive whole through this fragmentary lens.

What is perhaps the most debatable characteristic of this collage/montage form is the question of what is added to the message or content of the poem by using a more fragmented view. This debate is clearly visible within Langston Hughes' ''Montage'' in the question of who the primary voice belongs to and what is added by having Harlem shown through multiple people, as opposed to Hughes simply speaking from his own understanding of what makes Harlem.

===Verse-narrative===

A verse narrative, as one might expect, is simply a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. What is interesting about this subgenre is that owing to its place in the flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to ''Gilgamesh'', which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.

As one of the main subgenres, Verse-Narrative gets the least attention because it so effortlessly overlaps the other subgenres. It does not necessarily have the components of an Epic, nor the lyricism and shifting scope of a Lyric Sequence or a Lyric Series, nor the close relation to narrative of Verse Novel. It exists for critics generally as an accepted part of the long poem Tradition.

The Greek poet Vasileios Vasileiadis(1958-) with his two long poems &lt;Blind to see the Darkness&gt; and &lt;Point Zero&gt; is an example for the Verse-Narrative long poetry.

===Romantic long poem===

The critic Lilach Lachman describes the Romantic long poem as one that, "questioned the coherence of the conventional epic's plot, its logic of time and space, and its laws of interconnecting the narrative through action."  Examples of the Romantic long poem is Keats' long poem [[Hyperion (poem)|Hyperion: A Fragment]] (1820), William Wordsworth's [[Recluse (Wordsworth)|Recluse]] (Including the [[The Prelude|Prelude]] (1850), and [[Excursion (poem)|The Excursion]]), and Percy Bysshe Shelley's [[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]].

The Romance long poem contains many of the same components of the Romance Lyric. Michael O'Neil suggests that "much romantic poetry is torn out of its own despair" and, in fact, can exist as the tremulous fusion between "self-trust and self-doubt."

===Meditations===

Meditations are reflective thought poems. Like the Montage and the Series subgenres, Meditations can be somewhat fragmented, yet their connectivity is what makes the long poem a coherent and cohesive idea. This subgenre is based on meditations (or thoughts). Wallace Stevens believes, as do other writers in this genre, that the work does not rely on the use of multiple voices.

In her essay "The Twentieth Century Long Poem," Lynn Keller states that a more philosophical influence on these meditative long poems deals with relating imagination to reality, specifically in long poems by Wallace Stevens.  Keller notes, "Uninterested in American landscape, American history, modern mechanical triumphs, or the urban scene, his process-oriented long poems are speculative philosophical works exploring the relation of imagination to reality and the imagination's role in compensating for the loss of religious belief."

[[W. H. Auden]]'s ''New Year Letter'' is an example of a long-form meditative poem.

'''''Man v. Food''''' is an American [[food reality television series]]. It premiered on December 3, 2008 on the [[Travel Channel]]. The program was originally hosted by actor and food enthusiast [[Adam Richman]].&lt;ref name="chi9"/&gt; In each episode, Richman explores the "big food" offerings of a different American city before facing off against a pre-existing eating challenge at a local restaurant. The program airs in [[television syndication|syndication]] at various times during the week.

Travel Channel announced in May 2017 that the series would be revived, with actor, food lover, and restaurant business veteran Casey Webb replacing Richman as host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Rani Craft|title=Just Announced!

Casey Webb's second season on ''Man v. Food'' has been renewed with new episodes beginning later this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/man-v-food-1/articles/travel-channel-serving-up-season-two-of-man-v-food-|title=Breaking: Travel Channel Serving Up Season Two of 'Man V.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Host==
Series host [[Adam Richman (actor)|Adam Richman]] grew up in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], completed his [[undergraduate degree]] in [[international relations|International Studies]] at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and earned a [[master's degree]] from the [[Yale School of Drama]].&lt;ref name="lat5w"/&gt; A self-educated food "fanatic", since 1995 he has kept a travel journal including each of the restaurants he visited and what he learned from the trip.&lt;ref name="chi9"/&gt; Although described as "a bit on the husky side", to maintain his health while indulging for the show, Richman exercises twice a day while he's on the road.&lt;ref name="lat5w"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uri090205"/&gt; When the schedule permits, he does not eat the day before a challenge and he tries to stay "crazy hydrated" by drinking lots of water or club soda and foregoing coffee or soft drinks.&lt;ref name="411in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lv809"/&gt; After taping for a challenge is complete, Richman spends an hour or so on a treadmill, telling the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'', "Being sedentary is incredibly uncomfortable. Despite the fact that the first 10 minutes or 15 minutes on the treadmill might suck, it actually does alleviate a lot of pressure, and you feel better."&lt;ref name="lv809"/&gt;

==Premise==
In ''Man v. Food'', Adam Richman travels across the United States to explore the culture and unique "big food" of one city in each episode. In some episodes, Richman takes on food challenges involving very hot and spicy (or [[piquance|piquant]]) foods (such as foods spiced with [[habanero peppers]]), and also large quantities of food, such as a 5-pound-sandwich challenge. He finds places in each city to indulge his appetite and visits local landmarks.&lt;ref name="gbpg"/&gt; Richman interacts with local restaurateurs as they demonstrate the making of a house specialty or element of local cuisine. He gives a brief insight to the local community by talking to patrons at the establishments and asking about the most-talked about orders. The show emphasizes quality as well as quantity—a number of the locations in season one are [[Zagat]]-rated, while others have received honors from ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine as home of "The Best Sandwiches in America".&lt;ref name="esq080216"/&gt; Over the course of the series, his personal record was 37–22 (win-loss) in his food challenges. Combined with the team events in season four, the overall record stands at 48 wins for "Man" and 38 wins for "Food".

Episodes sometimes include a brief fantasy sequence where Richman pretends to be a character to psych himself up for the episode's big food challenge. The half-hour show culminates in Richman facing off against an established local food challenge. Each show wraps with a fake [[press conference]] where Richman fields questions about the challenge as if it were a just-concluded sporting event or as if he had just won, or in some cases lost, a big award.&lt;ref name="gbpg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsu902"/&gt;

Richman made one attempt at a [[Guinness World Record]] when he and a group of 40 regional eaters attempted a 190&amp;nbsp;pound burger in two hours, in which case food won the battle with about 30&amp;nbsp;pounds left of the burger.&lt;ref name="ml0911"/&gt;

==Critical reaction and reviews==
The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that the [[Travel Channel]] received its highest-ever ratings for a new debut with ''Man v. Food''. They highlighted the show as an example of other networks moving in on the traditional turf of the [[Food Network]].&lt;ref name="lat080114"/&gt;

In the ''[[Star-Ledger]]'', television critic Alan Sepinwall wrote, "It ain't deep, and it certainly ain't healthy (I could feel my arteries clog just from watching), but it's fun."&lt;ref name="sl081231"/&gt;

Features reporters Thomas Rozwadowski of the ''Green Bay Press-Gazette'' said that "playfully eager host Adam Richman has won me over" and that "it's all in good fun."&lt;ref name="gbpg"/&gt;

''CityPages Minneapolis/St. Paul'' describes the show, "...like the food version of ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'', with host Adam Richman as its very own [[Steve-O]]."&lt;ref name="cpms1"/&gt;

Christopher Lawrence of the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' describes Richman as "impressive" and "likable" saying "think a beefier [[Fred Savage]], although one who somehow weighs less than he did last season."&lt;ref name="lv809"/&gt;

Jonathan Bernstein of British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' described "mixed feelings" about the series saying he likes "the concept" and "the guy" but that the challenges make him "a little uneasy".&lt;ref name="ukg829"/&gt;

[[Charlie Brooker]], also of ''The Guardian'', was largely critical of the show's celebration of excess, stating "if food is the new porn, this is an all-out orgy between wobbling gutsos and farmyard animals&amp;nbsp;– a snuff orgy, no less, since the latter end up sawn in half and smothered in BBQ sauce."&lt;ref name="tg100313"/&gt;

[[Alton Brown]], host of the food science show ''[[Good Eats]]'', was also critical of the show, calling ''Man v. Food'' "disgusting," stating: "That show is about gluttony, and gluttony is wrong. It's wasteful. Think about people that are starving to death and think about that show. I think it's an embarrassment."&lt;ref name="eat100928"/&gt;

Food's entry on Facebook on November 9, 2010 |publisher=Facebook.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous seasons of ''Man v. Food'', Richman would recruit locals of the selected cities to take on the food challenges, while he serves as their coach. Richman stated that the change is not due to any lack of ability or desire to do the challenges himself, but instead to keep the show interesting.&lt;ref name="btc110422"/&gt; The locales featured on ''Man v. Food Nation'' were [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]],&lt;ref name="mvn110609"/&gt; [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Alburquerque]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], the [[Florida Keys]], the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Dallas]], [[U.S. Route 66]], [[Harlem|Harlem, New York City]], the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]], [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Oahu]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], as well as a "Street Eats" special and a Thanksgiving "Feast" special.

Food Nation'' premiered on June 1, 2011, with back-to-back episodes in New Haven and Tampa, and concluded on April 11, 2012 with back-to-back episodes in Charlotte and Jackson.

;Opening: {{cquote|''I'm Adam Richman. For years I was one man on a quest to discover the country's greatest chowdown joints and take on its legendary food challenges. Now it's your turn. Together we'll find the most delicious local eats and face down the mightiest meals. This is...Man v. Food Nation. ''|}}

The final record for this season was 11 wins for "Man" and 16 wins for "Food", and this was the first season in which "Food" won both the season opener and the finale, and most of all, "Food" had more wins than "Man."

This was Richman's final season on the show.

{{cquote|''For years, food's army has grown unchecked...bigger, spicier, bolder. But a hero rises, ready to taste the nation's most epic eats. I'm Casey Webb.

==Clip shows==
On March 3, 2010, ''Man v. Food: Carnivore Edition'' aired. The episode was mainly a [[clip show|compilation of clips]] from Richman's more "carnivorous" food stops. Some clips included [[barbecue]] in Amarillo, Texas, and the [[Thurman's|Thurman Burger]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="zap110408"/&gt;

On October 27, 2010, a special series of episodes, ''Man v. Food presents Carnivore Chronicles'' debuted on the Travel Channel; this series features clips from past meat-related episodes, including some segments that were featured in previous clip shows, with some unseen material included. This series is seen Wednesday nights at 9 pm ET.

Other clip shows included a ''Breakfast Edition'', featuring the series' most memorable breakfast dishes; a ''Dessert Edition'' and a ''Tailgate Edition'' were also shown.

Another clip show was ''Man v. Food's Greatest Moments'', which featured the challenges in Amarillo, New Orleans, New Brunswick, Fifth Third Ballpark (Comstock Park), San Francisco, San Jose, Little Rock, Washington D.C., and San Antonio, and featured commentary on the challenges by Adam.

The newest clip show, ''Amazing Eats'', premiered in January 2012, and it features previous ''Man v. Food'' and ''Man v. Food Nation'' clips in episodes set by certain themes (cheese, pork, burgers, etc.).

==Richman's retirement==
On January 27, 2012, Richman announced his retirement from food challenges.&lt;ref name="fb120127"/&gt; No exact reason was given as to why Richman retired, other than moving on and wishing his audience farewell. Explaining the show's re-tooling to become ''Man V. Food Nation'', Scripps Networks chairman Ken Lowe cited concerns over ensuring Adam Richman's health if the show had continued in its previous format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2011/nov/03/scripps-networks-interactive-reports-lower-q3/|date=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors Richman had since turned vegan were found to be untrue, though it is true he has since lost about {{convert|70|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. On Friday, August 5, 2016, Adam tweeted "I honestly have begun to feel bad for those buying in to the tabloid rumors suggesting I'm anything but an omnivore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pkbaseline.com/adam-richman-weight-loss-how-man-finds-food-star-lost-70-pounds

==Logo==
The ''Man vs Food'' logo (seasons 1-2) is almost identical to a well known eatery established in Mexico City in 1992. The logo for "El Cuadrilatero" ("The ring") differs very slightly from that of the TV show in that a coffee cup is present instead of a chicken leg.&lt;ref name="play24" /&gt;

'''Metacafe''' is a [[Video hosting service|video-sharing]] website that specializes in short-form video entertainment in the categories of movies, video games, sports, music and TV.

The company was headquartered in San Francisco, California, with an office in Los Angeles. Metacafe was acquired by the Collective Digital Services in 2012 and at this point Metacafe ceased to exist.

In its early years, Metacafe was similar to other video viewing websites such as YouTube or [[Dailymotion]], but has since turned into a short-form video entertainment. The company's partners had included marquee content providers such as major movie studios, video game publishers, broadcast and cable TV networks, music labels and sports leagues.

The site is advertising supported, working closely with brands in the entertainment, consumer electronics, telecommunications, consumer packaged goods, food &amp; beverage, and automotive sectors.

==Company statistics==
Metacafe used to attract more than 13 million unique monthly U.S. viewers and streams more than 53 million videos in the U.S. each month, according to comScore Video Metrix (March 2011). The site's global audience was more than 40 million unique monthly viewers.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==History==
Metacafe Inc. was founded in July 2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3337353,00.html Metacafe to be sold for USD 200 million] ''Ynetnews''. Retrieved January 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tel Aviv]] by [[Israelis|Israeli]] entrepreneurs Eyal Hertzog ([[Chief Technical Officer]]) and Arik Czerniak (CEO) and raised $3 million from [[Benchmark Capital]]. In June 2006, the company closed a [[venture capital|Series B financing]] round of $12 million. Investors included [[Accel Partners]] and [[Benchmark Capital]]. That September, the company moved its headquarters to [[Palo Alto]], California and in October, Metacafe was ranked the third largest video site in the world according to [[comScore]].&lt;ref name="try_harder"&gt;''We Try Harder,'' article from [http://ipcommunications.tmcnet.com/news/2006/11/29/234159.htm?p=video IPcommunications.tmcnet.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203204424/http://ipcommunications.tmcnet.com/news/2006/11/29/234159.htm?p=video |date=February 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Erick Hachenburg, previously an executive with [[Electronic Arts]], took over as CEO of the company but left in 2011 after being acquired by The Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/viral-videos-still-rule-at-metacafe/|title=Viral Videos Still Rule at Metacafe|last=Saul Hansell|date=10 October 2007|work=Bits|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, it was reported that Metacafe had been acquired by digital talent agency, The Collective. Although the terms of the deal were not released, the speculation suggested that the amount paid was significantly less than the total investment in Metacafe to date.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Producer rewards==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Directors cut screenshot.jpg|thumb|Metacafe's Director's Cut Page|{{deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 26 March 2008}}]] --&gt;

In October 2006, Metacafe announced its Producer Rewards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Metacafe.com/producer_rewards/ Metacafe - Producer Rewards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
program in which video producers were paid for their original content.

Pay only for U.S. views.

The program had several success stories, some of which have been featured on national TV, such as The Can Tossing Video,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1402448/can_toss/ Metacafe.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Beer Launching Fridge]] on [[David Letterman]], and the Ron Paul Girl series&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livfilms.com/?cat=6 Livfilms.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317112718/http://www.livfilms.com/?cat=6 |date=2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Liv Films,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacafe.com/channels/Liv+Films Liv Films' Channel]&lt;/ref&gt; that has been featured on [[Fox News]] and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livfilms.com/ Livfilms.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620070822/http://www.livfilms.com/ |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metacafe has also teamed up with notable TV producers like [[Steven Bochco]] (''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', ''[[L.A. Law]]'') with a series called ''Cafe Confidential'', a 44 [[webisode]] series consisting of teens and twenty-somethings sharing semi-autobiographical stories. The short-form videos, shot close-up, were taken from interviews of more than 100 people talking about memorable moments.

By the end of 2008, Producer Rewards was considerably curtailed before being shut down completely due to a lack of demonstrable profitability. Once the Producer Rewards program closed, users like Kipkay switched their focus to YouTube.

'''''Nuts and Wine''''' was a theatrical [[revue]], with lyrics by [[C. H. Bovill]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]] and music by [[Frank E. Tours]], with additional numbers by Guy Jones and [[Melville Gideon]], from a book by Bovill and Wodehouse. It was performed at the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]], London, opening on 3 January 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Variety Theatres (classified ads) |newspaper=Daily Express |date=3 January 1914}} Most sources incorrectly state 4 January (which was a Sunday, when it was against the law for UK theatres to open). The ''Daily Express'' advertisement reads "To-night at 8.30, First Performance of ''NUTS AND WINE'', The latest revue, by C H BOVILL and G P {{sic}} WODEHOUSE" and a review on Monday, 5 January, referred to the performance on "Saturday night".&lt;/ref&gt; The show closed on 28 March 1914, after a run of 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Classified advertisements) |newspaper=The Times |date=28 March 1914}}The advertisement for The Empire states "''NUTS AND WINE'' (Last Night)". Several authorities mistakenly state that there were only seven performances.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot synopsis==

The revue did not have a coherent plot,&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Barry|title=The complete lyrics of P G Wodehouse|year=2004|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0-8108-4994-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; its six scenes being linked only by a surreal vision of an England changed beyond recognition and by the appearance in each scene of the character of [[Punch Magazine|Mr Punch]], as [[Master of Ceremonies|compère]]:&lt;ref name="Day" /&gt;

Scene 1 – New [[Eton College|Eton]]

Scene 2 — ''New News''

Scene 3 – New ''[[Mayflower]]''

Scene 4 – New [[Ellis Island]]

Scene 5 – New [[Haymarket Theatre|Little Theatre]]

Scene 6 – New Empire Stores

Two other scenes—the New Clown and the New Idol—seem to have been dropped before the show opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dramatis personæ|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=28 December 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each scene provided a setting for a series of songs and dances, mostly satirising topics of the day, with frequent references to well-known personalities or topical events.

In the first scene, the playing fields of Eton have been turned into a [[market garden]], and the school curriculum has been reduced to just three subjects, [[music hall]], [[Argentine tango|tango]] (taught by music-hall star [[Gertie Millar]]), and agriculture.

The second scene is set in the offices of the ''New News'', a newspaper that has absorbed ''[[The Times]]'' and whose editor—one George L. Washington of Pittsburg, grandson of the famous president—prints the news first, then makes it happen. The newspaper's gossip columnist is Lady Teazle, actually one of the characters in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]'s ''[[The School for Scandal]]''. This scene included a lengthy song poking fun at [[David Lloyd George]], the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].

Scene 3 takes place on the New ''Mayflower'', a yacht which is carrying passengers to New Ellis Island. Though the yacht catches fire and sinks, the next scene is still set in New Ellis Island, a newly discovered country to which Britain has taken to banishing its bores and other inconvenient inhabitants.

The fifth scene is set in a music hall, the New Little Theatre, and features a [[play within a play]] supposedly written by the Vicar of Brixton, who watches from a [[Box (theatre)|box]] in the company of Mr Punch, while world boxing champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] shares another box with [[Frederick Brotherton Meyer|Rev F B Meyer]].&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuts and Wine": The new revue at the Empire|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=4 January 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real vicar of Brixton, the Rev A J Waldron, had recently authored a "semi-morality play".,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vicar's "problem" sketch|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=29 October 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Johnson, to the annoyance of many music-hall artistes, had been engaged to appear at a number of music halls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jack Johnson and the musichall|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=22 August 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play-with-a-play is performed by caricatures of well-known theatrical entertainers, including [[George Graves (actor)|George Graves]], [[Edmund Payne]], [[Wilkie Bard]], and [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]].&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt;

The final scene is set in the New Empire Stores and is a parody of ''[[Within the Law (play)|Within the Law]]'',&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;{{cite news |title="Nuts and Wine": New revue produced at the Empire |newspaper=Daily Express |date=5 January 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; a play (adapted from that of [[Bayard Veiller]]) which was then being performed at the [[Haymarket Theatre]]. and which featured a department store, the Emporium. The scene also included a sketch parodying another popular play, the French farce ''Who's the Lady'', by [[Jose Levy]], which had opened at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in November 1913.&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt;

==Performers==

Among those appearing in the revue, the following were specifically mentioned in the reviews or advertisements:&lt;ref name="Express" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Classified advertisements |newspaper=The Times |date=3 March 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[R G Knowles]]

==Critical reception==

The revue had a mixed reception. ''[[The Daily Express]]'' noted that "half a dozen scintillating items ... in these days of much dulness is probably not a bad achievement", but remarked of the script by Bovill and Wodehouse that "it does little credit to their ingenuity". The ''Express'' reserved most praise for the dancing of Phyllis Bedells, who was "thunderously cheered" for what it described as "the one purely and delightfully artistic contribution of the whole entertainment".&lt;ref name="Express" /&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' referred to "a number of clever artists for the most part making good fun out of material that was not very funny" and commented that "for lack of wit in the treatment, some of the best things miss fire",&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |title="Nuts and Wine": The new revue at the Empire |newspaper=The Times |date=5 January 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the London correspondent of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', in paragraph on the continuing craze for revues in England, dismissed it as "not a very brilliant specimen".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite news |title=Mimes and Music |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19140221.2.142&amp;srpos=15&amp;e=-------10--11----0%22Nuts+and+Wine%22-- |accessdate=21 February 2011 |newspaper=Evening Post |location=Wellington |date=21 February 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Express'' described the first scene as "one of the best" and referred to "the final brilliance of the New Empire Stores", but considered the marionette show in the fifth scene to be "very clever, but over-long".&lt;ref name="Express" /&gt; In sharp contrast, ''[[The Observer]]'' concluded: "Perhaps the most successful of all the scenes is the play at the New Little Theatre." But the ''Observer'''s final summing-up matched that of the other reviews: "For the rest, there did not seem to us to be quite as much novelty about the revue as the titles of the scenes suggested."&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt;

Despite their reservations, most of the reviews noted that the show was "very heartily applauded at the close",&lt;ref name="Express" /&gt; which may explain why it was performed nightly for 12 weeks; and it seems that the run came to an end not because the show was unsuccessful but because the management of the Empire Theatre changed during March 1914 and the new management&amp;mdash;[[Alfred Butt]] and [[Charles B. Cochran]]—wanted a change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bedells|first=Phyllis|title=My Dancing Years|year=1954|publisher=Phoenix House|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the name==

"Nuts and wine" is a reference to the British tradition of serving walnuts with the port that was passed around at the end of a dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The lexicographer's arm chair|journal=The Literary Digest|date=23 November 1918|volume=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Pac-Man'''|パックマン|Pakkuman|lead=yes}} is the [[protagonist]] fictional character of [[Pac-Man (series)|the game franchise of the same name]] by [[Namco]], who was first introduced in the Japanese arcade game ''[[Pac-Man]]'' on May 22, 1980, in Japan, and released in the United States in October the same year. He has since appeared in more than 30 officially licensed game spin-offs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamecenter.com/Features/Exclusives/Pacman/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980121102807/http://www.gamecenter.com/Features/Exclusives/Pacman/|title=The Legacy of Pac-Man|archivedate=1998-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in numerous unauthorized clones and bootlegs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.adelphia.net/~68hc11/bootpac/bootpac.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702002820/http://users.adelphia.net/~68hc11/bootpac/bootpac.htm|archivedate=2007-07-02|title=Pac-Man Bootleg Board Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; spawned a variety of ''Pac-Man'' merchandise with his image, as well as a [[Pac-Man (TV series)|television series]].&lt;ref name=pacpage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/25smartest/index6.shtml |title=The Pac-Page (including database of ''Pac-Man'' merchandise and TV show reference) |accessdate=2008-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218003840/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/25smartest/index6.shtml |archivedate=February 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pac-Man has become a worldwide social phenomenon and [[Bandai Namco Entertainment|Bandai Namco's]] [[mascot]].&lt;ref name=pacphenomenon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&amp;id=249 |title=Pac-Man: The Phenomenon - Part 1 |date=2002-01-31 |last=Goldberg |first=Marty |publisher=GameSpy |accessdate=2006-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016203822/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com:80/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&amp;id=249 |archivedate=2007-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character design==
Pac-Man's origins are debated. According to the character's creator [[Tōru Iwatani]], the inspiration was [[pizza]] without a slice, which gave him a vision of "an animated pizza, racing through a maze and eating things with its absent-slice mouth".&lt;ref name=greenpac&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2002/06/17/pac_man/|title=Pac-Man|last=
Green|first=Chris|date=2002-06-17|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=2006-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he said in a 1986 interview that the design of the character also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for a mouth, ''kuchi''.&lt;ref name=1986int&gt;{{cite book|last=Lammers|first=Susan|title=Programmers at Work: Interviews|year=1986|page=266|publisher=Microsoft Press|location=New York|isbn=0-914845-71-3|url=http://www.pacmanmuseum.com/history/Toru-artwork.php}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's name comes from {{nihongo|''paku-paku''|パクパク}}, an onomatopoeic Japanese word for gobbling something up.&lt;ref name="powerup"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohler|first=Chris | title = Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life | title-link=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life | publisher=Brady Games|date = 2005|isbn=0-7440-0424-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paku-paku"&gt;{{cite web | title=Daijisen Dictionary entry for ぱくぱく (''paku-paku''), in Japanese | accessdate =January 27, 2007|url=https://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%81%B1%E3%81%8F%E3%81%B1%E3%81%8F-600437#E5.A4.A7.E8.BE.9E.E6.9E.97.20.E7.AC.AC.E4.B8.89.E7.89.88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's name was originally written in English as "Puck-Man", but when Namco localized the game for the United States they changed it to "Pac-Man", fearing that vandals would change the P in Puck to an F.

The arcade art on the original Pac-Man portrayed him as a yellow circle with a large mouth as well as hands, feet, eyes and a long nose. In-game Pac-Man was represented as a two-dimensional sprite of a simple yellow circle with a mouth, which is his current design as of 2018. 1984's ''[[Pac-Land]]'' was the first game (of many) to use his arcade art in-game. More recently Pac-Man appears as a full three-dimensional polygonal model. His design went through two minor changes from the Puck-Man cabinet art over the years, the first made his nose smaller in the 1990s and the second altered his eyes and shoes in 2010.

[[File:Original PacMan2.png|thumb|left|upright|Pac-Man as he appears in [[Pac-Man|the original game]] from 1980]]
Pac-Man first appeared in [[Pac-Man|the original action game of the same name]]. Despite ''Pac-Man''{{'}}s legacy, Pac-Man himself would not appear again until the 1982 arcade release of ''[[Super Pac-Man]]'', which introduced a change into Super Pac-Man (Pac-Man increased in size and invulnerability). Later arcade games include ''Pac-Land'', ''[[Pac-Mania]]'' and ''[[Pac-Man Arrangement]]'', a remake of the original ''Pac-Man''. ''[[Pac-Man World]]'' was released in 1999 on the [[PlayStation]], and introduced new abilities to him (reminiscent to [[Mario]]'s and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'s abilities).&lt;ref name=worldreview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/puzzle/pacmanworld/review.html|title=Pac-Man World Review for PlayStation|publisher=GameSpot|last=Mielke|first=James|date=1999-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game contributed heavily to the series as well as the character and spawned two sequels and a spin-off as well. ''[[Pac-Man World 2]]'' features Pac-Man on an adventure to rescue Pac-Land from an ancient spirit known as Spooky. ''[[Pac-Man World 3]]'' was released in 2005 to celebrate Pac-Man's 25th anniversary.&lt;ref name=world3reviewGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/pacmanworld3/review.html|title=Pac-Man World 3 Review for PlayStation 2|last=Gouskos|first=Carrie|accessdate=2006-01-12|publisher=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=world3reviewIGN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/667/667752p1.html|title=Pac-Man World 3 - PlayStation 2 Review|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2005-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Pac 'n Roll]]'', a young Pac-Man is being trained by the great Pac-Master.&lt;ref name=pacnreview/&gt;

Several spin-offs have been released, such as a racing game ''[[Pac-Man World Rally]]''. [[Midway Games]] established a spin-off titled ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'' (featuring Pac-Man's wife of the same name), which was created without Namco's consent.&lt;ref name=essentialpacman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3122102|title=The Essential 50 Part 10 – Pac-Man|publisher=1UP.com|last=Kennedy|first=Sam|accessdate=2006-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pac-Man appears in ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]'' as a playable guest fighter, riding a giant [[Mokujin]] robot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-01-27-mega-man-and-pac-man-ps3-vita-exclusives-for-street-fighter-x-tekken|title=Mega Man and Pac-Man PS3/Vita exclusives for Street Fighter x Tekken • News &amp;bull; Eurogamer.net|date=27 January 2012|work=Eurogamer.net|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Everybody's Golf 6]]'' as a playable guest golfer (through DLC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=『みんなのGOLF 6』 追加DLC、『龍が如く』シリーズより|url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/scej/title/mingol/6/update/dlc.html|publisher=PlayStation.com|accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pac-Man has also appeared in all three ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP]]'' installments as a playable racer along with Ms. Pac-Man.

Pac-Man was recently threatened by lawyers from NAMCO thretening to sue him out of oblivian so he now resides in unblocked games for school websites. Pac-Man is also a playable character in [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']], co-developed by [[Sora Ltd.]] and [[Bandai Namco Games]]. Sporting his classic design used in artwork for the original game and in the ''Pac-Man World'' trilogy, Pac-Man's moveset is based around early ''Pac-Man'' games and various other Namco arcade titles, such as deploying a Power Pellet and dashing after it, summoning fire hydrants from ''Pac-Land'', or jumping on the trampoline from ''[[Mappy]]''. An [[Amiibo]] figure released of Pac-Man also allows ''Pac-Man'' elements to appear in compatible [[Nintendo]] titles, such as ''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Maker]]''.

Pac-Man also appears, in a larger role (including being prominently featured in promotional posters), in the 2015 film ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]'' among the arcade game characters that the aliens unleash as monsters upon Earth. His creator Tōru Iwatani also appears in the movie as an Electric Dreams Factory Arcade repairman while [[Denis Akiyama]] portrays the film's Tōru Iwatani, who tries to reason with Pac-Man only to get his right arm pixelated upon it being bitten by Pac-Man.

==Characterization==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}

Pac-Man is often portrayed as a family man, as a result of the multiple spin-offs of his games which star family members. He is often seen married to Ms. Pac-Man, and the father to either one or two children. In many incarnations he also has a pet dog, named Chomp-Chomp in his most famous depiction in the cartoon and Pac-Land. They are often seen living inside of a house shaped like Pac-Man's face with windows for eyes and a door in place of his mouth. In the cartoon series, this house was painted white, while often in the games it is painted yellow. ''[[Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures]]'', the new 2013 cartoon, portrays Pac-Man as being a high schooler who goes to school with friends Cylindria and Spiral.

In the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series, he nicknames Ms. Pac-Man "Pepper", Baby Pac-Man is a boy (in the games, she is a girl with a bow like her mother's) and he also had a pet cat named Sourpuss. The second season of the cartoon introduced Pac-Man Jr. as a greaser who was actually Pac-Man's nephew, and Super Pac-Man who was not Pac-Man himself, but a separate character who came into scenes after unzipping a zipper in the middle of the open sky. ''Pac-Land'' marks the first official use of Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Baby in a Namco title.

Pac-Man himself is often characterized as happy-go-lucky and fun loving, often with a voracious appetite, who enjoys adventure but often prefers a quiet family life. His first platforming title, Pac-Land, illustrating him taking frequent breaks between levels at signs that said "Break Time" while ending three-level arcs by returning to his home, leading to cutscenes where he is seen sitting with his family at dinner and sleeping in his bed. ''Pac-Man 2'' begins with Pac-Man doing chores for his family, with various elements of the game causing him to abruptly change his mood from happy, to sad, to angry, to silly, and even flaky. It culminates with the Ghost Witch's plot to create a monster made of chewed bubble-gum sparking a sense of heroism in Pac-Man causing him to seek out the witch and put a stop to her plot. The ''Pac-Man World'' series portrays Pac-Man as being generally happy, though slightly sarcastic, protecting his family, and ultimately his whole world from an evil-doing ghost named Orson and his plans to take over Pac-Land from the spectral zone, where the Ghosts from his games are said to come from.

Pac-Man's job varies from game-to-game. In the Hanna-Barbera animated series he is said to be the protector of the Power Pellet Forest, which the main villain Mezmaron hopes to infiltrate and steal power pellets for energy to use in his evil schemes. In the games, he is often portrayed as not having a job, but is recognized throughout Pac-Land as a hero who constantly rids them from the threat of ghosts. Pac-Man World indicates that he has a job, since he is seen walking home from work with a lunchbox in hand, but it is never specified exactly what his job is. Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures portrays Pac-Man as a student.

Pac-Man has had a variety of arch enemies through the years. The mysterious Mezmaron, the villain of the Hanna-Barbera series, used the five main "ghost-monsters" (as they were called in the television series) from the game — Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde and Sue — as henchmen in his plot to steal the power pellets from the Power Pellet forest. His second nemesis, the Ghost Witch, appeared in ''Pac-Man 2'' and ''[[Pac-In-Time]]'', also using the main five ghosts from the games as henchmen. In the first game, she attempted to take over Pac-Man's city by creating a monster out of pre-chewed gum. In the second, she attempted to rid herself of Pac-Man by banishing him to a time warp. The ''Pac-Man World'' games' main villain was Orson, an ordinary ghost who was also an inventive genius. Orson was the villain in the first title, but assisted Pac-Man in the third game against a greater threat to the both of them, Erwin. Spooky, a ghost once vanished by Pac-a-Lot, that was freed (albeit unintentionally) by Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde. In Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, the villain is Betrayus, the dead brother of President Spheros.

Pac-Man's relationship to the original four ghosts who appeared in his game is usually one of friendly antagonism. In virtually every game and cartoon Pac-Man sees the ghosts as a nuisance rather than a threat, and often has a power pellet handy to dispatch their bullying attempts in an instant. The ghosts in turn are often portrayed as being crude, boorish, and bullying but ultimately bumbling and useless in their attempts to get the better of Pac-Man. In ''Ghostly Adventures'', the girl ghost Pinky has a crush on Pac.

What happens to Pac-Man when he is caught by the ghosts varies. The cartoon made stated that if the ghosts "chomped" Pac-Man, he would temporarily lose his skeleton. However, after seeing that as too graphic for children, later seasons instead stated that Pac-Man would be temporarily weakened after being chomped. ''Pac-Man 2'' indicated that the Ghosts were actually adept at scaring Pac-Man, often by making funny faces, and Pac-Man was powerless against them unless he had a Power Pellet. ''Pac-Man World'' simply indicates that when Pac-Man touches a ghost, it is similar to them coming to blows with one another. The 2011 cartoon pilot suggests that Pac-Man could actually eat the ghosts without the aid of a power-pellet, but if he does the ghost turns into tasteless goo in Pac-Man's mouth which he would prefer not to eat.

In ''A Guide to Research in Music Education,'' Phelps, Ferrara and Goolsby define research as the identification and isolation of a problem into a workable plan; the implementation of that plan to collect the data needed; and the synthesis, interpretation and presentation of the collected information into some format which readily can be made available to others. Research typically falls into one of four categories: experimental, descriptive, historical, or philosophical.

==Types of Research==

===Experimental===
Experimental research is used to determine what will be or to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. An example of experimental research is a 2000 study by Prickett and Bridges. The purpose of the study was to determine if the basic song repertoire of vocal/choral music education majors is significantly better than instrumental music education majors. The study revealed no significant difference between the two groups, and that neither group had developed a strong repertoire of standard songs outside of the college music classroom. The impact of the study was the recommendation that professors preparing music education students for their future careers consider adding activities to music education courses that build a strong song repertoire.

===Descriptive===
Descriptive research is used to determine what is and is usually conducted for one of three purposes:
#to obtain data on the current status of existing phenomena, such as conditions, practices, and situations
#to establish relationships among several variables, using the data about the current status to investigate relationships that may provide greater insight into the current status
#to determine developments, trends, or changes by describing variables as they develop over a period of time
There are three broad categories of descriptive research: survey studies, relationship studies, and development studies.

====Survey Studies====
A survey is a systematic method of collecting information on one or more variables. An example of a survey study is a 1998 study by Gillespie and Hamann. The purpose of the study was to gather descriptive information about orchestra programs that can be used as baseline data when considering the needs of school string programs. The findings indicated a continued enrollment increase in school orchestras in the 1990s although the number of orchestra teachers remained stable, and that larger schools are more likely to offer orchestra instruction. The impact of the study was the recommendation that school systems should provide larger, more adequate teaching facilities and that universities and string teachers should emphasize strategies for teaching larger string classes in their teacher preparation programs.

====Development Studies====
Development studies collect information on existing situations, determine relationships, and examine changes in these variables over a period of time. Development studies include:
#longitudinal studies, which are conducted over a period of time with data collected from the same sample at specific intervals during the study
#trend studies, in which a population is sampled and subjects at the same level of development are tested
#cohort studies, which measure an entire population at periodic intervals over a period of time

===Historical===
Historical research refers to the collection of data to record and interpret past events. Source materials used by the historical researcher are normally of two kinds, primary and secondary. A primary source is first-hand information, observed directly by the researcher. A secondary source is second-hand information, not original to the researcher. Through the process of external criticism, the researcher learns whether or not the object of scrutiny is authentic. Through the process of internal criticism, the researcher determines if the information contained in the object is credible. An example of historical research is a 1993 study by Gruhn. The purpose of the study was to determine if [[Lowell Mason]]'s ''Manual of the Boston Academy of Music for the Instruction in the Elements of Vocal Music on the System of Pestalozzi'' is truly based on Pestalozzian principles. A detailed comparison of the ''Manual,'' a work by Pfeiffer and Nageli, and a work by Kubler revealed that the Pfeiffer and Nageli work is much closer to the ideas advocated by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] than the Kubler work, and that Mason's ''Manual'' is little more than a translation of Kubler.

===Philosophical===
[[International Society for Philosophy of Music Education|Philosophical research]] is used to examine the underlying principles in any field. An example of philosophical research is a 1999 article by [[Bennett Reimer]] published in ''The Music Educators Journal'': "Facing the Risks of the Mozart Effect." This article is a response to the practice of music educators who advocated music education because of its relationship to spatial task performance. A 1993 research report from the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irving by Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky is an example of the research literature that supported what became to be known as "the [[Mozart Effect]]." Reimer rejects spatial task performance as justification for music education because, according to Reimer's aesthetic philosophy, music education should be justified by its merit as an art, not for extra-musical reasons.

==History of Research in American Music Education==
In 1837 the Connecticut General Assembly voted to collect educational data. Questionnaires were sent to all Connecticut schools in 1838. Eight questions were about music instruction. This was probably the first attempt in the U.S. to collect data on music instruction on a wide-scale basis and perhaps the earliest example of research in music education.

In 1918 the Educational Council was established by the Music Supervisors National Conference (later the Music Educators National Conference or [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|MENC]]). The Educational Council published bulletins, mostly based on survey data and including recommendations for the profession. One such bulletin was ''The Present Status of Music Instruction in Colleges and High Schools 1919-1920.'' In 1923 the name of the organization was changed form Educational Council to the National Research Council of Music Education. The name changed again in 1932 to the Music Education Research Council. The ''Journal of Research in Music Education'' began publication in 1953 under the editorship of [[Allen Britton]]. At first many of the articles were based on historical and descriptive research, but in the early 1960s the journal began to shift to experimental research. The Society for Research in Music Education was established in 1960, and in 1963 the ''Journal of Research in Music Education'' became its official publication. The MENC Historical Center was established in 1965. In 1978, MENC founded several Special Research Interest Groups.

==Research Publications==
Price and Chang (2000) provide an overview of the many diverse music education research journals including annotation and publication details for each source. While the ''Journal of Research in Music Education'' continues to be the dominant journal in the field, other journals include the ''[[Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education]],'' ''The Missouri Journal of Research in Music Education,'' ''The Bulletin of Research, Contributions to Music Education, The Bulletin of Historical Research in Music Education,'' and ''Update: The Applications of Research in Music Education. '' Research on the impact of music education research journals includes investigations of initial citation speeds (Hancock, 2015) and accumulated citations (Hamann &amp; Lucas, 1998).

==Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning==
One of the dominant events in the field of music education research was the 1992 publication of the ''Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning.'' Edited by Richard Colwell, the ''Handbook'' contains fifty-five chapters written by more than seventy scholars. Colwell edited a second volume in 2002, ''The New Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning.''

To see the shift of emphasis that has taken place in music education research in recent years, one need only compare the contents of the 1992 volume and the 2002 volume. The inclusion of sections on "Conceptual Framework" and "Evaluation" in the 1992 volume is evidence of emphasis on standards and a set body of knowledge. The absence of similar sections in the 2002 volume is evidence of a shift toward a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosophical and a [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] teaching theory. The inclusion of a section on "related arts" in the 2002 volume recalls the research of the late 1960s and 1970s.

A '''ring girl''' is a woman who enters the ring between rounds of a [[combat sport]], carrying a sign that displays the number of the upcoming round. Ring girls are often seen in [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]].

==History==
Ring girls first appeared in a 1965 edition of ''[[Ring Magazine]]''. The magazine published a photo of a Las Vegas model holding a sign at a boxing match. Boxing promotions adapted the concept of ring girls at their events.&lt;ref name="livestrong"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/422685-what-are-the-girls-who-walk-around-the-boxing-rings-between-rounds/|title=What Are the Girls Who Walk Around the Boxing Rings Between Rounds?|author=Steven Kelliher|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=August 9, 2017|publisher=livestrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In professional wrestling, ring girls are attendants who remove the entrance gear (such as jackets, robes, and other clothing) and championship belts from the ring after a wrestler takes them off before his match. Throughout the 1980s, [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] employed ring girls known as the Federettes. Since its inception in 2002, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] has featured various independent female wrestlers and valets as ring girls.

During the first year of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'', WWE featured traditional boxing-style ring girls who carried signs featuring various ''Raw''-themed slogans in the ring between matches.

==Controversies==
===Sexism===
Some sports viewers, medias and fighters claim that ring girls are unnecessary. Ring girls first appeared in boxing, when viewers are mostly men. Having half-naked women at the games provided sexual attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/92032564/boxings-ring-girls-harmless-entertainment-or-dark-ages-sexism|title=Boxing's ring girls: harmless entertainment or Dark Ages sexism?|date=April 28, 2017|author=Kevin Norquay|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We have women as part of the actual athletic competition in MMA," argued sports columnist Ben Fowlkes, "We have a multitude of female fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/03/trading-shots-what-outdated-tradition-should-mma-ditch-once-and-for-all|title=Trading Shots: What outdated tradition should MMA ditch once and for all?|date=March 8, 2015|author=Ben Fowlkes and Danny Downes|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports journalist Malissa Smith called ring girls "blatant sexual exploitation".

In contrast, some people see ring girls as a harmless tradition. Boxing promoter Lisa Elovich calls the practice "part of the show."&lt;ref name="livestrong"/&gt; Neuroscientist Jack Pemment argues that ring girls help grow modeling careers for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/blame-the-amygdala/201307/the-role-ring-girls-professional-fighting-events|title=The Role of Ring Girls at Professional Fighting Events|date=July 4, 2013|author=Jack Pemment|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ring boys" or "ring guys" have been proposed for women's matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1402083-ufc-2012-should-the-ufc-get-rid-of-ring-card-girls|title=In Light of the Ronda Rousey News, Should the UFC Get Rid of Ring Card Girls?|date=November 8, 2012|author=Matt Saccaro|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/mma-say-hello-to-ring-dudes|title=MMA,Say Hello to Ring Dudes|date=October 11, 2013|author=Amy Winters|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-boxer [[Mikaela Laurén]] said "I want a number boy. I think that's only fair, and I'm sure it will give the women in the audience some pleasure as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/boxing-champ-mikaela-lauren-wants-ring-boys-for-her-next-fight|title=Boxing Champ Mikaela Lauren Wants "Ring Boys" for Her Next Fight|date=April 21, 2016|author=Sarah Kurchak|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While all-female fighting promotion [[Invicta FC]] utilizes ring girls, the promotion brought in UFC fighter and sometimes model [[Elias Theodoreau]] to serve as a ring boy at Invicta FC 28. In an appearance on [[Ariel Helwani]]'s [[The MMA Hour]], Theodoreau said that "Mixed martial arts has been at the forefront of equality in many different ways. You can see in regards to women being on top of pay-per-views and selling millions and also now myself included as the first ring boy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/2/19/17028530/elias-theodorou-to-act-as-ring-boy-at-invicta-fc-28|title=Elias Theodorou to act as ‘ring boy’ at Invicta FC 28|date=February 19, 2018|author=Alexander K. Lee|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodoreau received criticism, however, for using the occasion to promote sponsors, and for showing less skin than a ring girl traditionally would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mmajunkie.com/2018/03/ufc-ring-boy-elias-theodorou-steal-invicta-spotlight-or-add-shine|title=Trading Shots: Did 'ring boy' Elias Theodorou steal Invicta FC spotlight or add shine?|date=March 25, 2018|author=Ben Fowlkes and Danny Downes|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payments===
There were speculations that ring girls are paid more than some female athletes. In 2015, former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] bamtamweight champion [[Ronda Rousey]] protested. "Do you think her walking in circles, " argued Rousey, "is worth more (than fighters)? ... either the ring card girls are paid too much, or the fighters aren't paid enough." UFC ring girls are reputedly paid $18,000 a year. This excludes jobs outside the UFC, like modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ladbible.com/more/viral-sport-this-is-how-much-ufc-ring-card-girls-earn-20170324|title=This Is How Much UFC Ring Card Girls Earn|date=March 24, 2017|author=Mark McGowan|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UFC ring girl [[Arianny Celeste]] protested, calling Rousey a "big bully".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/26/big-bully-ronda-rousey-in-heated-feud-with-ufc-ring-girl/|title='Big bully' Ronda Rousey in heated feud with UFC ring girl|author=Brian Lewis|date=February 26, 2015|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/02/ronda-rousey-responds-to-arianny-celestes-bully-comments-im-sorry-but-im-not-impressed-with-the-job/|title=Rousey on Celeste's 'bully' comments: 'I'm sorry, but I'm not impressed with the job'|author=Brent Brookhouse and John Morgan|date=February 25, 2015|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I think people don't realise how much work it is to be a model," argued Celeste, "Trying being like a live mannequin and having clients put you in a million different outfits... It's not as easy as it looks... Not a lot of people would know that unless they were in my shoes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/02/arianny-celeste-on-ufc-champ-ronda-rouseys-criticism-i-see-her-as-a-big-bully|title=Arianny Celeste on UFC champ Ronda Rousey's criticism: 'I see her as a big bully'|date=February 25, 2015|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''TR-55''', released in 1955, was [[Sony]]'s first [[transistor radio]], and the first to be made in [[Japan]].  The use of [[transistor]]s allowed the device to be much smaller than earlier [[vacuum tube]] [[radio]]s. 

==History==
[[Akio Morita]] and [[Masaru Ibuka]], then operating under the business name [[Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo]], had been working on plans to introduce a transistor radio to the market since 1953. When the TR-55 was released in Japan in August 1955, it was the first transistor radio marketed in that country. The TR-55 featured the Sony name, but the company did not officially change its name to Sony until January 1958.&lt;ref name="Nathan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Nathan|title=Sony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XZ11jJPKQQC&amp;pg=PA35|date=8 March 2001|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-12694-5|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1955, Morita met with a representative of the [[Bulova]] watch company in New York City. Bulova agreed to order 10,000 units on the condition they carry the Bulova name. Morita declined the deal.&lt;ref name="Grayson2012" /&gt; Sony later signed a deal with New York importer Adolph Gross to distribute an improved and slightly more compact model, and in March 1957, the Sony TR-63 transistor radio would become Sony's first product sold in the US.&lt;ref name="Grayson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Grayson|title=Sony: The Company and Its Founders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ORVw3rodZAC&amp;pg=PA40|date=1 September 2012|publisher=ABDO Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-61480-183-2|pages=40–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TR-63 would not fit in existing shirt front pockets, so the company issued shirts with expanded pockets to salesmen so they could claim the product was "the world's first pocket sized transistor radio".&lt;ref name="Schiffer1991" /&gt;

==Technical specifications==
Powered by four AA batteries, the TR-55 used a [[superheterodyne]] circuit incorporating two AF stages and covered the [[medium wave]] broadcast band. The TR-55 used the following transistors:&lt;ref name="RM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Model TR-55, Sony; Tokyo|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/sony_sony_tr55_tr_55_tr_55.html|website=Radiomuseum.org|publisher=RadioMuseum|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*(1) 2T51 (oscillator-mixer)
*(2) 2T52 (for IF)
*(1) 2T53 (AF driver) 
*(1) 2T12

The TR-55's five transistors were designed in house by Sony, the technology having been licensed from [[Bell Labs]]. This made Sony the first company to produce commercial transistor radios from the ground up. American company Regency had launched their [[Regency TR-1]] transistor radio earlier in 1954, but bought the transistors from [[Texas Instruments]]. Printed circuit boards were used, which was unusual for the time.&lt;ref name="Schiffer1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Schiffer|title=The Portable Radio in American Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5C87BmhRegC&amp;pg=PA208|year=1991|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0-8165-1284-3|pages=208–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sony.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=TR-55 Product Design|url=https://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/product/1950/tr-55.html|website=Sony.net|publisher=Sony|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical specifications==
The speaker grille was made from punched aluminum, and its design was reportedly inspired by [[Lincoln Motor Company]] automobiles of the era. Although it was not as compact as originally intended, the relatively small size of the TR-55 was a novelty, and attracted the attention of Japanese consumers.&lt;ref name="Grayson2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sony.net" /&gt;

==''Take It or Leave It''==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Takeitorleaveit.jpg|right]] --&gt;
''The $64,000 Question'' had its roots in the [[CBS Radio|CBS]] [[Old time radio|radio]] quiz show, ''Take It or Leave It'', which followed in the wake of the pioneering ''[[Professor Quiz]]'' (radio's first quiz program) and ''[[Uncle Jim's Question Bee]]'' (the second radio quiz show). ''Take It or Leave It'' ran from April 21, 1940 to July 27, 1947. It was first hosted by [[Bob Hawk]] (1940–41), followed by [[Phil Baker (comedian)|Phil Baker]] (1941–47).

Contestants were asked questions devised by the series' writer-researcher Edith Oliver. She attempted to make each question slightly more difficult than the preceding one. After answering a question correctly, the contestant had the choice to "take" the prize for that question or "leave it" in favor of a chance at the next question. The first question was worth one dollar, and the value doubled for each successive question, up to the seventh and final question worth [[United States dollar|$64]].

During the 1940s, "That's the $64 question" became a common [[catchphrase]] for a particularly difficult question or problem. In addition to the common phrase "Take it or leave it", the show also popularized another phrase, widely spoken in the 1940s as a taunt but now mostly forgotten (except in [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. cartoons]]). Chanted in unison by the entire audience when someone chose to risk their winnings by going for the $64 prize, it was vocalized with a rising inflection: "You'll be sorrr-REEEE!"

The popularity of the radio program inspired a 1944 [[20th Century Fox]] feature film, ''[[Take It or Leave It (1944 film)|Take It or Leave It]]'', about a man who needs $1,000 to pay his wife's obstetrician. When he is chosen as a contestant on the radio quiz show, the prize money is increased beyond the usual $64.

In 1947, the series switched to NBC, hosted at various times by Baker, [[Garry Moore]] (1947–49), [[Eddie Cantor]] (1949–50) and [[Jack Paar]] (beginning June 11, 1950). On September 10, 1950, the title of ''Take It or Leave It'' was changed to ''The $64 Question''. Paar continued as host, followed by Baker (March–December 1951) and Paar (back on December 1951). The series continued on NBC Radio until June 1, 1952.

Only five recordings of ''Take It or Leave It'' are known to survive.

==''The $64,000 Question''==
''The $64,000 Question'' was created by Louis G. Cowan, formerly known for radio's ''[[Quiz Kids]]'' and the television series ''[[Stop the Music (TV series)|Stop the Music]]'' and ''[[Down You Go]]''. He drew the inspiration for the name from the earlier show "Take It or Leave It", and its $64 top prize offering. He decided to expand the figure to $64,000 for the new television program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/peopleevents/pande06.html&lt;/ref&gt; Cowan had difficulty locating sponsorship for ''The $64,000 Question''. Cosmetics giant [[Helena Rubenstein]], which eventually did become a familiar television advertiser, rejected the idea, reportedly because its wealthy founding namesake did not own a television set at the time and had no idea of the medium's advertising potential. The [[Chrysler Corporation]] turned down the chance to launch the show because the automaker reportedly feared sponsoring a big-money quiz show would outrage company workers whose wages they were trying not to inflate. A vacuum cleaner company also said no to Cowan, reportedly because the concept would be too glamorous for its product.

Finally, Cowan convinced [[Revlon]]. The key: Revlon founder and chieftain [[Charles Revson]] knew top competitor [[Hazel Bishop]] had fattened its sales through sponsoring the popular ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', and he wanted a piece of that action if he could have it. According to ''Fire and Ice''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewtobias.com/fireandice.html|title=Fire and Ice, by Andrew Tobias|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114044749/http://www.andrewtobias.com/fireandice.html|archivedate=January 14, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1976), [[Andrew Tobias]]' biography of Revson, Revlon first signed a deal to sponsor Cowan's brainchild for 13 weeks with the right to withdraw when they expired.

''The $64,000 Question'' premiered June 7, 1955 on CBS-TV, sponsored by cosmetics maker Revlon and originating from the start live from CBS-TV Studio 52 in New York (later the disco-theater [[Studio 54]]). The first contestant on the show was Thelma Farrell Bennett, [a NYC fashion model from Trenton, New Jersey] who failed to make it to the first plateau but won a 1955 Cadillac convertible which she sold a month after taking delivery. 

To increase the show's drama and suspense, it was decided to use an actor rather than a broadcaster as the host. Television and film actor [[Hal March]], familiar to TV viewers as a supporting regular on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'' and ''[[My Friend Irma (radio-TV)|My Friend Irma]]'', found instant fame as the quiz show's host, and Lynn Dollar stood nearby as his assistant. Author and TV panelist [[Bergen Evans|Dr. Bergen Evans]] was the show's expert authority, and actress [[Wendy Barrie]] did the "Living Lipstick" commercials. (Coincidentally, in 1978, Evans and Barrie died within 72 hours of each other.) To capitalize on the initial television success, the show was also simulcast for two months on CBS Radio where it was heard from October 4, 1955 to November 29, 1955.

The J. Fred &amp; Leslie W. MacDonald Collection of the [[Library of Congress]] contains one kinescoped episode featuring Virgil Earp, elderly nephew of [[Wyatt Earp]], winning $32,000.  It was broadcast in early 1958.

==Gameplay==
Contestants first chose a subject category (such as "Boxing", "Lincoln" or "Jazz") from the Category Board. Although this board was a large part of the set, it was seen only briefly, evidently to conceal the fact that categories were sometimes hastily added to match a new contestant's subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://potrzebie.blogspot.com/2008/08/charles-van-doren-and-fake-construct.html|title=Potrzebie: &lt;span style="font-size:110%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:110%;"&gt;Charles Van Doren and the Rip in the Fabric of Reality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contestant would then be asked questions only in the chosen category, earning money which doubled ($64, $128, $256 to $512, then $1,000, $2,000, $4,000, $8,000, $16,000, $32,000 to $64,000) as the questions became more difficult. At the $4,000 level, a contestant would return each week for only one question per week. They could quit at any time and retire with their money, but until they won $512, if they got a question wrong, they were eliminated without winning anything. Missing a question worth between $1,000 and $4,000 left the contestant with $512. Once the contestant won $4,000, if they missed a question they received a [[consolation prize]] of a new [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]]. Starting with the $8,000 question, they were placed in the [[Revlon]] "[[isolation booth]]", where they could hear nothing but the host's words. As long as the contestant kept answering correctly, they could stay on the show until they had won $64,000. The first contestant to win the top prize money, on September 13, 1955, was Richard S. McCutchen, a [[United States Marines|Marine]] whose subject was [[cooking]]. McCutchen became an instant celebrity, with people stopping him in the street to ask for his autograph.

==Public reception==
Almost immediately, ''The $64,000 Question'' beat every other program on Tuesday nights in ratings. Broadcast historian Robert Metz, in ''CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye'', claimed U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] himself did not want to be disturbed while the show was on and that the nation's crime rate, movie theater, and restaurant patronage dropped dramatically when the show aired. It earned the #1 [[Nielsen ratings|rating spot]] for the 1955–56 season, holding the distinction of being the only television show to knock ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' out of the #1 spot, and finished at #4 in the 1956–57 season and #20 in 1957–58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/index.htm|title=ClassicTVHits.com: TV Ratings|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its imitators or inspirations were ''[[The Big Surprise]]'', ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]]'', and ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]''.

===''The $64,000 Challenge''===
Not only did Charles Revson not exercise his withdrawal right, but he wanted another way to take advantage of ''Question'''s swollen audience. April 8, 1956 saw the debut of ''The $64,000 Challenge'' (initially co-sponsored by [[Revlon]] and [[Lorillard Tobacco Company]]'s [[Kent]] cigarettes), hosted through August 26 by future children's television star [[Sonny Fox]] and then, for the remainder of the show's life, [[Ralph Story]].

It pitted contestants against winners of at least $8,000 on ''The $64,000 Question'' in a new, continuing game where they could win another $64,000. The contestants took turns answering questions from the same category starting at the $1,000 level. If they each answered a question correctly, the next level would be twice that of the previous level. Starting at the $4,000 level, both contestants answered the same question while each standing in their own isolation booth. If, at any given level, a contestant answered correctly with the other contestant missing a question, the winning contestant may keep that money and face a new opponent or continue playing against the same challenger at the next money level.

In time, the sister show came to include various celebrities, including bandleader [[Xavier Cugat]] and child star [[Patty Duke]], as well as former ''Question'' champions.

The J. Fred &amp; Leslie W. MacDonald Collection of the [[Library of Congress]] contains one kinescoped episode featuring Capt. Richard McCutchen as a contestant.  It was broadcast July 1, 1956.

===Everyday celebrities===
''Question'' contestants sometimes became celebrities themselves for a short while, including 11-year-old Robert Strom (who won $192,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|192000|1954}}}} today)) and Teddy Nadler ($252,000 across both shows (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|252000|1954}}}} today)), the two biggest winners in the show's history. Other such newly made celebrities included Italian-born Bronx shoemaker Gino Prato, who won $32,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|32000|1954}}}} today) for his encyclopedic knowledge of [[opera]]. The longest enduring of these newly made celebrities was psychologist [[Joyce Brothers]]. Answering questions about [[boxing]], she became, after McCutchen, the second top winner, and went on to a career providing psychological advice in newspaper columns and TV shows for the next four decades. Another winner, Pennsylvania typist Catherine Kreitzer, read [[Shakespeare]] on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. ''[[TV Guide]]'' kept a running tally of the money won on the show, which hit $1 million by the end of November 1956 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1956}}}} today).

The ''American Experience'' (PBS) episode probing the scandal noted, "All the big winners became instant celebrities and household names. For the first time, America's heroes were intellectuals or experts–jockey Billy Pearson on art, Marine Captain McCutchen on cooking–every subject from the Bible to baseball. Not only had the contestants become rich overnight, but they were also treated to a whirlwind of publicity tours, awards, endorsements and meetings with dignitaries. Traveler Gino Prato, whose category was opera, was brought to Italy for a special performance at la Scala and honored by an audience with the Pope. After winning $64,000, spelling whiz Gloria Lockerman, an [[African American]], became a guest speaker at the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]]. She also appeared as a guest on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]'' where she was warmly greeted by [[Martha Raye]] and fellow guest [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Baseball expert Myrtle Power was made a sports commentator on CBS. Eleven-year-old stock market expert [[Leonard Ross|Lenny Ross]] was asked to open up the New York Stock Exchange. And with only an eighth-grade education, supply clerk Teddy Nadler, an expert on everything, won more money than any other contestant. It was a new kind of hero in America, a common person with the uncommon gift of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/filmmore/transcript/index.html|title=The American Experience – Quiz Show Scandal – Program Transcript|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchandising and parodies===
One category on the Revlon Category Board was "Jazz", and within months of the premiere Columbia Records issued a 1955 album of various jazz artists under the tie-in title ''$64,000 Jazz'' (CL 777, also EP B-777), with the following tracks: "The Shrike" (Pete Rugolo), "Perdido" (J.J. Johnson, Kai Winding), "Laura" (Erroll Garner), "[[Honeysuckle Rose (song)|Honeysuckle Rose]]" (Benny Goodman), "Tawny" (Woody Herman), "One O'Clock Jump" (Harry James), "How Hi the Fi" (Buck Clayton), "I'm Comin', Virginia" (Eddie Condon), "A Fine Romance" (Dave Brubeck, Paul Desmond), "I Let A Song Go Out of My Heart" (Duke Ellington) and "Ain't Misbehavin'" (Louis Armstrong).

Other musical tie-ins included the 1955 song "The $64,000 Question (Do You Love Me)", recorded by Bobby Tuggle (Checker 823), Jackie Brooks (Decca 29684) and the Burton Sisters (RCA Victor 47-6265). "Love Is the $64,000 Question" (1956), which used the show's theme music by Norman F. Leyden with added [[Fred Ebb]] lyrics, was recorded by Hal March (Columbia 40684), Karen Chandler (Decca 29881), Jim Lowe (Dot 15456) and Tony Travis (RCA Victor 47-6476).

When the show was revived in 1976 as '''''The $128,000 Question''''', its theme music and cues were performed (albeit with a new disco-style arrangement for the theme) by [[Charles Randolph Grean]], who released a three-and-a-half-minute single, "The $128,000 Question" (the show's music and cues as an instrumental), with the B-side ("Sentimentale") on the Ranwood label (45rpm release R-1064). For the show's second season, Grean's music package was re-recorded by Guido Basso.

There were numerous parodies of the program, including in the [[Foghorn Leghorn]] cartoon "[[Fox Terror]]", [[Bob and Ray]]'s ''The 64-Cent Question''. ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' featured Hal March as a contestant in an October 20, 1957 spoof&lt;ref&gt;[http://epguides.com/JackBennyProgram/ The Jack Benny Program episode guide]&lt;/ref&gt; with Benny asking the questions. As a gag, Benny actually appeared as a contestant on ''The $64,000 Question'' on October 8, 1957, but insisted on walking away with $64 after answering the first question. Hal March finally gave him $64 out of his own pocket.

At the height of its popularity, ''The $64,000 Question'' was referenced in the scripts of other CBS shows, usually but not exclusively through punch lines that included references to "the isolation booth" or "reaching the first plateau." Typical of these was spoken by ''[[The Honeymooners]]''' Ed Norton ([[Art Carney]]), who identified three times in a man's life when he wants to be alone, with the third being "when he's in the isolation booth of ''The $64,000 Question''." At least three other ''Honeymooners'' episodes referenced ''Question'': In ''A Woman's Work Is Never Done'' Ralph proposes to Alice that he go on the show because he's an expert in the "Aggravation" category. In ''Hello, Mom'' Norton tells Ralph that his mother-in-law's category on the show would be "Nasty". In ''The Worry Wart'', Ralph advises Alice to become a contestant because she's an expert in the "Everything" category.

Another episode of ''The Honeymooners'', delivered one of the best known ''Question'' references – a parody of the show itself, in one of the so-called "Original 39" episodes of the timeless situation comedy. In that episode, blustery bus driver Ralph Kramden becomes a contestant on the fictitious ''$99,000 Answer''. Regarded as one of the [[Golden Age of Television]]'s best quiz show parodies, the ''Honeymooners'' episode depicted Kramden spending a week intensively studying popular songs, only to blow the first question on the subject when he returned to play on the show. The host of the fictitious ''$99,000 Answer'' was one Herb Norris, played by former ''[[Twenty Questions]]'' emcee and future ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]]'' host [[Jay Jackson]].

The show has been referenced on other game shows. On the U.S. version of ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', an episode aired January 15, 2007, in which the banker's offer was $64,000. Host [[Howie Mandel]] said, "This is the $64,000 question."

==Cancellation==
Three years after it exploded into a nation's consciousness, ''Question'' and ''Challenge'' were dead. Having faded in popularity as it was, in the wake of the hugely popular ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' championship of [[Charles Van Doren]], ''Question'' and ''Challenge'' were yanked off the air within three months of the [[quiz show scandal]]'s eruption. ''Challenge'' went first on September 14, 1958 with ''Question''—once the emperor of Tuesday-night television—taking its Sunday-night timeslot after a three-month hiatus until it was killed on November 9.

===Scandal===
The relatively new but phenomenally popular ''[[Dotto]]'', and then ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'', were found to have been rigged and were promptly canceled. A ''Challenge'' contestant, Rev. Charles Jackson, told the federal grand jury probing the quiz shows that he received answers during his screening for his appearance. That prompted ''Challenge'''s sponsor, the [[Lorillard Tobacco Company]] (Kent, Old Gold cigarettes), to drop the show.

''The $64,000 Question'' had the opposite problem: sponsor [[Revlon]]—possibly under pressure from its chieftain, Charles Revson, who has been credited with expressing the desire for famous faces that prompted ''Challenge'''s expansion to include celebrities—often tried to interfere with the production of ''Question'', including and especially trying to bump contestants it simply disliked, no matter whether the audience liked them. Revson's brother, Martin, was assigned to oversee ''Question''–including heavy discussions of feedback the show received. The would-be bumpees included Joyce Brothers herself, who managed to outwit the question writers and Revlon long enough to win the maximum prize.

According to producer Joe Cates in a PBS documentary on the scandals, he used an IBM sorting machine to give the illusion that the questions were randomly selected – in fact, all of the cards were identical. Since all of the buttons were on one line {{clarification needed|date=December 2017}}, they were mostly for show.&lt;!--Reference is the transcript of the PBS "Quiz Show Scandals" documentary.--&gt;

It was revealed during Congressional investigations into the quiz show scandal that Revlon was as determined to keep the show appealing – even if it meant manipulating the results – as the producer of ''Twenty-One'' (albeit also under sponsor pressure) had been. Unlike ''Twenty-One'' and ''Dotto'', where contestants got the answers in advance, Revlon was reportedly far more subtle: they may have depended less on asking questions on the air that a contestant had already heard in pre-air screenings than on switching the questions kept secure in a bank vault at the last minute, to make sure a contestant the sponsor liked would be suited according to his or her chosen expertise.

The most prominent victim may have been the man who launched the franchise in the first place. Louis Cowan, made CBS Television president as a result of ''Question'''s fast success, was forced out of the network as the quiz scandal ramped up, even though it was [[NBC]]'s and not CBS' quiz shows bearing the brunt of the scandal – and even though CBS itself, with a little help from sponsor [[Colgate-Palmolive]], had moved fast in cancelling the popular ''[[Dotto]]'' at almost the moment it was confirmed that that show had been rigged. Cowan had never been suspected of taking part in any attempt to rig either ''Question'' or ''Challenge''; later CBS historians suggested his reputation as an administrative bottleneck may have had as much to do with his firing as his tie to the tainted shows. Cowan may have been a textbook sacrificial lamb, in a bid to preempt any further scandal while the network scrambled to recover, and while president [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]] accepted complete responsibility for any wrongdoing committed under his watch.

The quiz show scandals ultimately resulted in a "shift in the power to program television". The networks used the scandal as an argument to eliminate the abuse of sponsor controlled programming in prime-time broadcasting, which would then allow the networks to take control of program production into their own hands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/shows/64000-question-aka-64000-challenge&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
By the end of 1959, all first generation big-money quizzes were gone with single-sponsorship television following and a federal law against fixing television game shows (an amendment to the 1960 Communications Act) coming. Except for the skill-based ''[[Jackpot Bowling]]'' (1959–1961) and ''[[Make That Spare]]'' (1960–1964), a period on ''[[Beat the Clock]]'' (1960) when its Bonus Stunt grew in $100 increments past the $10,000 mark until finally being won for $20,100 on September 23, and the short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] quiz ''[[100 Grand (game show)|100 Grand]]'' (1963), the networks stayed away from awarding five-figure cash jackpots until the premiere of ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10,000 Pyramid]]'' and ''[[Match Game]] 73'' in 1973. The disappearance of the quiz shows gave rise to television's next big phenomenon–[[Western (genre)|Westerns]].

None of the people directly involved in rigging any of the quiz shows faced any penalty more severe than suspended sentences for perjury before the federal grand jury that probed the scandal, even if many hosts and producers found themselves frozen out of television for many years. One ''Question'' contestant, Doll Goostree, sued both CBS and the producers in a bid to recoup $4,000 she said she might have won if her match of ''Question'' hadn't been rigged. Neither Goostree nor any other quiz contestant who similarly sued won their cases.

* '''Louis Cowan''' – In addition to ''[[Quiz Kids]]'' (1949–1951) and ''[[Stop the Music (TV series)|Stop the Music]]'' (1949–52, 1954–56), Cowan also created ''[[Down You Go]]'' (1951–1956) and the short-lived ''Ask Me Another'' (1952). Cowan briefly served as [[CBS]] Television Network president before leaving in the wake of the quiz show scandals. He later joined the faculty of the [[Columbia University]] school of journalism. He and his wife Polly were killed in an apartment fire in New York City in 1976. Lou Cowan's son Geoffrey later produced brief revivals of ''Quiz Kids'' in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and is currently dean of the [[University of Southern California]] Annenberg School for Communication.
* '''Hal March''' – The former comic actor who became an overnight star on ''Question'' continued to appear as an actor in television and movies throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Shortly after he signed on as host of ''[[It's Your Bet]]'' in 1969, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and died in 1970, four months short of his 50th birthday.
* '''Irwin "Sonny" Fox''' – The first ''Challenge'' host was also known at the time for co-hosting the CBS children's travelogue ''Let's Take a Trip'' (Fox described it as "Taking two children on sort of an electronic field trip every week–live, remote location, no audience, no sponsors"), but his fame rests predominantly on his eight-year (1959–1967) tour as the suave, congenial and dryly witty fourth host of New York's Sunday morning children's learn-and-laugh marathon, ''[[Wonderama]]''. Fox hosted ''Way Out Games'' (1976–1977), a Saturday-morning series for CBS, then later spent a year (1977–1978) running children's programming for NBC and eventually became a chairman of the board for Population Communications International, a nonprofit dedicated to "technical assistance, research and training consultation to governments, NGOs and foundations on a wide range of social marketing and communications initiatives", for which he is still an honorary chairman. Fox has also been a board chairman for the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
* '''Patty Duke''' – A child star (thanks to her [[The Miracle Worker|Broadway]] portrayal of [[Helen Keller]]) when she appeared on ''Challenge'', she eventually testified to Congressional investigators – and broke to tears when she admitted she'd been coached to speak falsely, an incident Sonny Fox described when interviewed for the PBS program reviewing the quiz scandals. Duke survived to become a television star (''[[The Patty Duke Show]]'') in the early-to-mid-'60s, before moving on to more film and television work (including a memorable role in ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]''), becoming an activist in the [[Screen Actors Guild]], writing two memoirs (''Call Me Anna'' and ''A Brilliant Madness'') describing her troubled child acting career and her lifelong battle with [[manic depression]], and becoming an advocate for better protection and benefits for child actors. She died on March 29, 2016, from Sepsis, resulting from a ruptured Intestine.
* '''Charles Revson''' – Inspired by cosmetics competitor [[Hazel Bishop]] (whose sponsoring of ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' provided big sales to Bishop) to think about television sponsorship in the first place, Revson was never investigated in his own right for his role in the quiz show scandals despite testifying (as did his brother, Martin) before Congress when the scandals broke in earnest. The cosmetics empire he founded, however, continued its success – and continued to sponsor television programming – for many years after the scandals faded away. Known as a hard-driving, hard-driven perfectionist whose overbearing manner usually alienated even his closest business partners, Revson's success left him a billionaire when he died in 1975. His charitable foundation has since given over $145 Million in grants to schools, hospitals, and service organizations in various Jewish communities.
* '''Dr. [[Joyce Brothers]]''' – Only the second contestant to win the show's big prize (after expertly thwarting numerous attempts to bump her from the show because Martin Revson was said to have disliked her and doubted her credibility as a boxing expert), Brothers has enjoyed the most enduring fame and media success among anyone who rose to prominence by way of ''Question''. Her championship as a boxing expert led to an invitation to become a commentator for CBS' telecast of a championship boxing match between [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] and [[Carmen Basilio]]. By August 1958, Brothers was given her own television program, first locally in New York and then in national syndication. Making numerous television and radio appearances as a psychologist, not to mention numerous television comedy roles, Brothers has also written a long-running syndicated advice column in newspapers and magazines, which was used as a source for some questions on the 1998–2004 revival of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''. She is still considered, arguably, the first media psychologist and had been licensed by New York as a psychologist since 1958. She died from respiratory failure on May 13, 2013 at age 85.
* '''Ralph Story''' – He became the much-loved host of ''Ralph Story's Los Angeles'' (1964–1970), still considered the highest-rated, best-loved local show in Los Angeles television history. Story has also hosted ''A.M. Los Angeles'' and was the narrator for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''Alias Smith and Jones'' in 1972–1973. He died on September 26, 2006 at the age of 86.

==Revivals==
Selected PBS outlets showed surviving kinescopes of the original ''Question'' in Summer 1976, as a run-up to a new version of the show called ''[[The $128,000 Question]]'', which ran for two years. The first season was hosted by Mike Darrow and produced at the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in New York City, while the second was produced at [[Global Television Network]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada and hosted by [[Alex Trebek]].

In 1999, television producer [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]] attempted to revive ''Question'' as ''The $640,000 Question'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], before abandoning that project in favor of producing an American version of the British game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''. ''Millionaire'' has a very similar format to ''The $64,000 Question'' – 15 questions (now 14) in which the contestant's money roughly doubles with each correct question until reaching the top prize. However, the questions in ''Millionaire'' are of a broader variety than ''Question'''s one-category line of questioning and have a different category for each question, contestants are allowed to leave the game with their money after a question is revealed but before it is answered, and ''Millionaire'' offers three chances for help (called "lifelines"), which were not present in ''Question''.

In 2000, responding to the success of ''Millionaire'', [[CBS]] bought the rights to the property in a reported effort to produce another revival attempt, ''The $1,064,000 Question'', to be hosted by [[sportscaster]] [[Greg Gumbel]]. Because of format issues similar to those encountered by Davies for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], this version was never broadcast.

==International versions==

===Australia===
A similar version was successful in Australia from 1960 to 1971 on [[Seven Network]]. Initially called ''Coles £3000 Question'', the show changed its name to ''Coles $6000 Question'' on February 14, 1966 (the date Australia converted to decimal currency) and was sponsored for most of its run by [[Coles Supermarkets]]. In July 1971, Coles dropped its sponsorship and the show became ''The $7000 Question''. It was hosted by Malcolm Searle (1960-1963) and Roland Strong (1963-1971).

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|The $64,000 Question (UK game show)}}

===Mexico===
The Mexican version, "El Gran Premio de los 64,000 pesos" lasted from 1956 to 1994 with some interruptions, changes of name to compensate peso devaluation, and changes of TV network. Most of the time it was hosted by Pedro Ferriz. A movie was made in which Ferriz asks questions to a character played by Sara García, known then as "Mexican Cinema's Granny."

'''''The Shout''''' is a 1978 British [[horror film]] directed by [[Jerzy Skolimowski]], based on a short story by [[Robert Graves]] that was adapted for the screen by Michael Austin. The film was the first to be produced by [[Jeremy Thomas]] under his [[Recorded Picture Company]] banner.

== Plot ==
Crossley ([[Alan Bates]]), a mysterious travelling man invades the lives of a young couple, Rachel and Anthony Field ([[Susannah York]] and [[John Hurt]]). Anthony is a composer, who experiments with sound effects and various electronic sources in his secluded [[Devon]] studio. The couple provides hospitality to Crossley but his intentions are gradually revealed as more sinister. He claims he has learned from an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] [[shaman]] how to produce a "terror shout" that can kill anyone who hears it unprotected.

==Cast==
* [[Alan Bates]] as Crossley
* [[Susannah York]] as Rachel Fielding
* [[John Hurt]] as Anthony Fielding
* [[Robert Stephens]] as Chief Medical Officer
* [[Tim Curry]] as Robert Graves
* Julian Hough as Vicar
* [[Carol Drinkwater]] as Wife
* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Fielder in cowpat
* [[Susan Wooldridge]] as Harriet

== Production ==
The North Devon coastline, specifically [[Saunton Sands]] and [[Braunton Burrows]], was used for the bulk of the location shooting.
The church of St Peter in Westleigh Bideford used in church scenes. The producer, Jeremy Thomas, later remembered his experience making the film,

{{quote|Because I had a great director, and a quality piece of literature I managed to get a wonderful cast such as John Hurt and Alan Bates. Skolimowski had a sense of shooting style then, this was the second director who I had worked closely with, and it was fascinating watching Skolimowski work. He came from a Polish tradition, the Wajda Film School, he had a different background to other directors I had been working with in the cutting rooms or elsewhere. And it made the film much more creative to me. I saw it more as an artistic endeavour by him.

The film went to Cannes and won the Grand Prix de Jury. We were incredibly lucky and the film was appreciated by the jury. It was a very small festival then, nothing like the [[Cannes Film Festival]] of today, it was a small event in a cinema of 800 people or so.&lt;ref name=berlinale&gt;{{cite web |title="At the Cutting Edge" – Producer Jeremy Thomas, interviewed by producer Sandy Lieberson |first=Jeremy |last=Thomas |author2=Lieberson, Sanford |date=2006-04-11 |url=http://www.berlinale-talentcampus.de/story/89/1789.html |publisher=[[Berlinale Talent Campus]] |accessdate=2010-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524091710/http://www.berlinale-talentcampus.de/story/89/1789.html |archivedate=24 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The soundtrack is by [[Mike Rutherford|Michael Rutherford]] and [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] of the rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The central theme "From the Undertow" features on Banks's album ''[[A Curious Feeling]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Accolades==
The film was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1978 Cannes Film Festival]] and received the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prize of the Jury]],&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1972/year/1978.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Shout |accessdate=2009-05-21|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a tie with ''[[Bye Bye Monkey]]''.

==In popular culture==
* In ''[[The Guard (2011 film)|The Guard]]'' (2011), Sergeant Boyle ([[Brendan Gleeson]]) is seen watching ''The Shout'' on television.

==History and leadership==
Varsity Spirit was founded by Jeff Webb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheercoachmagazine.com/display_article.php?uniqueid=136 |title=Industry Profile: Jeff Webb of Varsity Brands, Inc |publisher=Cheercoachmagazine.com |date=2006-05-01 |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a yell leader at the University of Oklahoma contemplating law school. While working in summers as a camp instructor for National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) with [[Lawrence Herkimer]],&lt;ref name="philstar"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.philstar.com/sports/2015/02/23/1426732/ncc-nationals-continuing-rich-tradition | title=NCC Nationals: Continuing a rich tradition | work=Philstar.com | date=23 February 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he decided to start Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA). Webb had a vision to combine cheerleading with high energy entertainment and traditional school leadership. He founded UCA in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/print-edition/2015/06/19/top-100-varsity-squad-leader-jeff-webb-rallies.html | title=Top 100: Varsity squad leader Jeff Webb rallies billion-dollar spirit brands | work=[[Bizjournals.com]] | date=19 June 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015 | author=Michael Sheffield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb used marketing and promotional campaigns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marketers Are Joining the Varsity|publisher=''New York Times''|date=June 11, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/business/media/11adcol.html | first=Stuart | last=Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase cheerleading's profile. In 1983, ESPN first broadcast eight hours of Varsity's national championships, a relationship that continues to this day. In 2002, Webb was featured in a USA Today article entitled From Megaphones to Mega-Profits.&lt;ref name="usatoday2002"/&gt; Varsity worked on driving the development of an international phenomenon that now not only includes millions of young Americans, but also a rapidly growing number of participants worldwide. In 2004, they announced a merger to form the largest partnership in the cheerleading and dance team industry.

In June 2010, Jeff Webb was called upon Title IX Case: Quinnipiac University in the federal trial in Connecticut, as an expert witness to clarify if Competitive College Cheerleading was a Title IX Compliant Sport to allow for the Quinnipiac University Volleyball Team to be replaced by the less costlier Quinnipiac University All Girl Cheerleading Team as proposed by the Quinnipiac University Athletic Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20100623/quinnipiac-trial-legitimacy-of-cheerleading-as-sport-focus-of-plaintiffs | title=Quinnipiac trial: Legitimacy of cheerleading as sport focus of plaintiffs | work=[[New Haven Register|New Haven Register News]] | date=23 June 2010 | accessdate=6 August 2015 | author=Bill Cloutier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Varsity merged with Herff Jones, the Indianapolis-based provider of graduation, achievement and educational products and services, such as class rings and jewelry, yearbooks, motivation and recognition tools, and educational products. Jeff Webb was named President and COO in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2012/12/11/jeff-webb-named-president-coo-of.html | title=Jeff Webb Named President, COO of Herff Jones | work=[[Bizjournals.com]] | date=11 December 2012 | accessdate=6 August 2015 | author=Michael Sheffield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varsity Spirit and cheerleading safety==
Varsity Spirit requires a Safety Awareness class for all of its more than 350,000 cheerleading camp attendees and worked with the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) to require that all college programs are under the direction of a safety certified coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kristin Hoskinson |url=http://www.aacca.org/ |title=aacca.org |publisher=aacca.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For cheerleading safety, it partnered with the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators (AACCA), a nonprofit risk management organization that has certified more than 20,000 coaches from its founding, and is seen as the standard of cheerleading safety. AACCA was founded in 1987 with initial funding from Varsity Spirit.&lt;ref name="philstar" /&gt;

Since 2006, Varsity Spirit has provided safety audits for several of the NCAA Basketball Conference tournaments, including the Big 10 and others, to ensure the cheerleading squads are in compliance with safety requirements.

The NCAA's insurance company has only had a single catastrophic injury claim from cheerleading since 2006, when the NCAA partnered with Varsity and started requiring that coaches receive safety training like the AACCA course. Under the new safety program, both participant and coach training on technical cheerleading skills will emphasize learning in a progressive format, as well as on basic safety rules and limitations for games and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://aacca.org/media/resources/AACCA_Study_Release_6-27.pdf | title=New Study Finds Cheerleading Safety Efforts Are Starting to Pay Off | work=The American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training is provided at Varsity Spirit summer camps throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eacourier.com/sports/cheerleaders-are-athletes-too/article_52ae0db0-f97d-11e1-b3ba-001a4bcf887a.html | title=Cheerleaders are athletes, too! | publisher=Eastern Arizona Courier | date=8 September 2012 | accessdate=6 August 2015 | author=Jay David Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS) developed a Spirit Coaches Education Program in 2007, and selected the AACCA Safety Course as the first course offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.athleticmanagement.com/2008/10/30/support_needed/index.php | title=Support Needed | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varsity Spirit's educational curriculum also provides technical training in the more advanced safety modules presented by the NFHS.

In 2009, AACCA and Varsity Spirit announced stricter safety standards for all competitions, which addressed the proper environment and equipment for cheerleading activity and clarified the requirements for spotters on the competition floor. In May 2010, AACCA released new safety guidelines for elementary, middle and junior high school teams. In 2011, Varsity Spirit covered the cost of the AACCA Safety Course for 200 coaches.

In March 2011, Varsity Spirit supported USA Cheer as it developed the USA Cheer Safety Council in partnership with the American Sports Medicine Institute (ASMI) in Birmingham, Alabama, founded by Dr. James Andrews, the renowned orthopedic surgeon.

==Philanthropy==
===St. Jude Children's Research Hospital===
In 2011, Varsity Spirit began "Team Up for St. Jude," a fundraising campaign to support the children's research hospital. "Team Up for St. Jude" includes a letter writing campaign and Team Up for St. Jude Game Day events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Student-roundup-6374123.php | title=Student roundup | work=Times Union | date=8 July 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2015, Varsity Spirit, through the Team Up for St. Jude Spirited by Varsity campaign, has contributed more than $2.6 million to St. Jude.

===National School Spirit Day===
Varsity Spirit created National School Spirit Day in 2009 to share stories and to encourage cheerleaders and dancers to participate in community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2030273/Kendall-Jenner-shows-school-spirit-cheerleading-uniform.html | title=Go team!

In 2015, National School Spirit Day expanded to all of Varsity Brands, creating America's Most Spirited High School contest.

===Varsity Brands School Spirit Awards===
In 2016, Varsity Spirit took part in the Varsity Brands School Spirit Awards to honor schools, school groups and individuals who go the extra mile to build school pride, student engagement and community spirit.

==Gameplay==

===Setting===
''White Knight Chronicles: Origins'' signs the player character up to the Mobile Corps, a mercenary organization that operates via train. Traversing into the no-man's-land between Athwan and Yshrenia, whisking you into a thrilling world of shuddering battles between hulking warriors.

Rattling across the vast plains that separate two sworn foes is the special steam train that acts as your central hub. Through this hub you access missions as they become available, and spend earned Grace Points on new equipment.

When the trusty Mobile Corps train rolls into a new, exotic location, you select a team of three skilled mercenaries to accompany you and stride out into the unknown. You can even add carriages to it to make room for new characters; plus, if you own White Knight Chronicles II on PlayStation 3, you can transfer data between the two games and receive special bonuses aboard the train.

===Battle system===
The battle system used in White Knight Chronicles: Origin is a real-time system identical to its console counterpart, where the battle mode is initiated automatically when enemies are present.

Before a battle the player optionally goes into the "Battle Preparation" menu (accessible at any time) and chooses up to three sets of five commands for your in-game avatar.

This set of commands is called a "Function Palette" and several of these palettes can be saved, making tactical palette preparing and switching essential to the game. The commands can also be linked in order to create combos. These can then be used in battle. The player controls one of the characters while the others are controlled by the AI, as also seen in the previous games.

The main character possess the ability to transform into a mighty Optimus, a powerful warrior with heightened defences and a range of thunderous attacks. Along with teammates who can do the same, you form an impressive war machine capable of shredding even the fiercest beasts.

After defeating an enemy, players will obtain raw materials. While this occurs in both the offline and online modes, some raw materials will only be obtainable in online quests. Materials are used for crafting, and upgrading, equipment and items.

==Plot==
10,000 years before the original PS3 game takes place, there was a period of strife known as the Dogma Wars. This struggle is between the Yshrenian Empire who are harnessing the power of the Knights in a bid to conquer the world, and the Athwani Mage Kingdom who are trying to stop them. These events would shape history to come in the White Knight Chronicles saga, and White Knight Chronicles: Origins tells the story of the unsung heroes who lived through this period of unrest, only to be forgotten in the annals of time.
