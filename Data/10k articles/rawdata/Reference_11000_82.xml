      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6624">The [[Louisiana State Museum]]'s '''1850 House''' is an [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] row house furnished to represent life in mid-nineteenth-century [[New Orleans]]. It is located at 523 St. Ann Street on [[Jackson Square (New Orleans)|Jackson Square]] in the [[French Quarter]]. 
[[File:1850 House - Jackson Square.jpg|framed|Furniture on display]]

==History==
The Upper and Lower [[Pontalba Buildings]], which line the St. Ann and St. Peter Street sides of Jackson Square, were built in 1850 by [[Micaela Almonester, Baroness de Pontalba]], the daughter of Don [[Andres Almonaster y Rojas]], the Spanish colonial landowner appointed to the ''Cabildo'' for life, and who built the Cathedral and Presbytere. Inspired by the imposing Parisian architecture the Baroness favored, the distinctive [[row houses]] were intended to serve as both elegant residences and fine retail establishments. In 1921 the Pontalba family sold the Lower Pontalba Building to philanthropist William Ratcliff Irby who subsequently, in 1927, bequeathed it to the State Museum.

Baroness Pontalba engaged noted local architect James Gallier, Sr. to design the row houses, though she dismissed him before construction was begun, and she employed Samuel Stewart as the builder. She also convinced authorities to renovate the Square, ''Cabildo'' and Presbytere, and church authorities to enlarge the Cathedral. When the Pontalba buildings were completed in 1849 and 1851, each contained sixteen separate houses on the upper floors and self-contained shops on the ground floors. The "A and P" monograms that decorate the cast-iron railings signify the Almonaster and Pontalba families.

During the mid-19th century, the first floor of the Pontalba buildings housed businesses, including dry goods stores, clothing stores, law offices and even a bank and railroad company. Upstairs are the parlor, dining room and three bedrooms. The house also comprises a back wing (called the "kitchen building" in the builder's contract), which served a variety of purposes, including storage, additional workspace and housing for slaves or servants. 

==Residents==
City directories from the 1850s and the 1860 census show that many Pontalba heads of household were merchants who were affluent enough to afford to rent in one of New Orleans's most fashionable locations. Children, slaves and servants completed the Pontalba household. An average of nine residents occupied each dwelling.

Families who rented #8 St. Ann: 
*Members of the Soria family were merchants who came to New Orleans from New York to take advantage of the vast economic opportunities here. Like the majority of Pontalba residents, the Sorias were [[slavery in the United States|slave]] owners, their slaves numbering between five and eight. 
*Widow Amelia Zacharie Saul Cammack lived in the house with her son, Thomas Dixon Cammack, and three of her four daughters, Gertrude, Kate and Amelia. The family owned between three and seven slaves during their Pontalba residency. The arrangement of the living quarters roughly corresponds to the way the Cammacks lived from 1853 to 1856. 
*William G. Hewes moved here in 1856 with his two daughters, Caroline and Anna, and five slaves. Hewes was president both of a bank and of the New Orleans, Opelousas and Great Western Railroad.

==Museum==
The [[Louisiana State Museum]] took possession of the building in 1927 and opened the 1850 House to the public in 1948. To illustrate the landmark's historical significance, the State Museum has re-created what one of the residences would have looked like during the Antebellum era when the Baroness Pontalba first opened her doors. Faithfully furnished with domestic goods, decorative arts and art of the period, the 1850 House depicts middle-class family life during the most prosperous period in New Orleans' history. Limited docent- and curator-led tours are available as is self-directed viewing.

Because residents of this row house were tenants who lived here for a few years at a time, the 1850 House does not represent any single family. Rather it reflects mid-nineteenth-century prosperity, taste, and daily life in New Orleans. Some pieces have a history of ownership in Louisiana, while local furniture shops made or sold others. The house comprises several revival styles that were popular in the 1850s, including rococo revival, Gothic revival, and classical revival.

Highlights: 
*Old Paris porcelain 
*New Orleans silver 
*A six-piece bedroom suite, comprising a large half-tester bed, a duchesse or dressing table, two mirror-faced armoires, a washstand and a nightstand. Attributed to the warerooms of Prudent Mallard and made for Mrs. Magin Puig of 624 Royal. 
*Other furnishings by William McCracken, J &amp; JW Meeks, Sèvres, Bennington, and Cornelius &amp; Baker 
*Paintings by French-trained artists Jacques Amans, Jean Joseph Vaudechamp, Aimable Desire Lansot, François Bernard, who came to New Orleans in the early to mid 19th century.

==1850 House Museum Store==
The Friends of the Cabildo operates the 1850 House Museum Store, the official gift shop for the Louisiana State Museum properties in New Orleans. The 1850 House Museum Store is located on [[Jackson Square (New Orleans)|Jackson Square]] in the historic Lower [[Pontalba Building]]s. In addition to membership and fundraising endeavors, the Friends of the Cabildo is able to provide financial support to the Louisiana State Museum through the sales of daily French Quarter Walking Tours and merchandise at the 1850 House Museum Store. At the store one can find handmade art, jewelry, pottery and crafts by local artists, books on everything from history to food to voodoo, and exhibit-related merchandise from Louisiana State Museum properties. French Quarter walking tours are also available (which also includes free admission to the 1850 House Museum).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3426">'''''Acta Diurna''''' ([[Latin]]: ''Daily Acts'' sometimes translated as ''Daily Public Records'') were daily [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[official notice]]s, a sort of daily [[gazette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |title=Acta Diurna |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Acta}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were carved on stone or metal and presented in message boards in public places like the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] of [[Rome]]. They were also called simply ''Acta''.

==History==
Acta Diurna, also called ''Acta Populi'', ''Acta Publica'' and simply ''Acta'' or ''Diurna'', in ancient Rome a sort of daily [[government gazette]], containing an officially authorized narrative of noteworthy events at Rome.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Acta Diurna |volume=1 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its contents were partly official (court news, decrees of the emperor, senate and magistrates), partly private (notices of births, marriages and deaths). Thus to some extent it filled the place of the modern [[newspaper]].&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt;

The origin of the Acta is attributed to Julius Caesar, who first ordered the keeping and publishing of the acts of the people by public officers (59 B.C.; Suetonius, Caesar, 20). The Acta were drawn up from day to day, and exposed in a public place on a whitened board called an ''[[Album (Ancient Rome)|Album]]''. After remaining there for a reasonable time they were taken down and preserved with other public documents, so that they might be available for purposes of research.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt;

The Acta differed from the [[Annals]] (which were discontinued in 133 B.C.) in that only the greater and more important matters were given in the latter, while in the former things of less note were recorded. Their publication continued till the transference of the seat of the empire to [[Constantinople]]. There are no genuine fragments extant.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 159"/&gt;

Sometimes [[scribe]]s made copies of the ''Acta'' and sent them to [[Roman governor|governor]]s for information. Later emperors used them to announce royal or senatorial decrees and events of the court. Other forms of ''Acta'' were legal, municipal and military notices.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

''Acta Diurna'' introduced the expression “publicare et propagare”, which means "make public and propagate." This expression was set in the end of the texts and proclaimed a release to both Roman citizens and non-citizens.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Legacy==
Today, there are many [[academic journal|academic periodical]]s with the word ''acta'' in their titles (the publisher [[Elsevier]] has 64 such titles). ''Acta Diurna'' was also used as the title of a Latin newspaper, published by Centaur Books.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Alcatraz Morgue''' is the [[morgue]] on [[Alcatraz Island]], off the coast of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It is located on the northwestern side of the island towards the centre, halfway between the [[Alcatraz Water Tower]] and the Dining Hall, below the side of the Recreation Yard.

==Architecture==
The morgue was built in 1910 by the U.S. military on a site which was formerly the entrance to a tunnel which was used by soldiers from the 1870s to cross to the opposite side of the island.&lt;ref name="PD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photoscapedesign.com/Places/California-2009/Alcatraz/8982928_BfPT2f/601501616_4SqDr#!i=601501616&amp;k=4SqDr|title=Alcatraz -Morgue|publisher=Photoscapedesign.com|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as "one of the simplest expressions of the mission revival style on Alcatraz."&lt;ref name="Alcatraz"&gt;{{cite book|title=Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ivs4jv5KCQC&amp;pg=PT74|accessdate=31 August 2012|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-1-4521-1310-4|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The morgue was built with three vaults and an examination table, with a steel door and a grated skylight.&lt;ref name="PD"/&gt; The double-door is a mint green color and is padlocked. The examination table is now covered with moss and in poor condition.&lt;ref name="PD"/&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Alcatraz Morgue2.jpg|Doors
File:Alcatraz Morgue3.jpg|Interior
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Use==
The morgue was only documented to have been used once when a deceased prisoner was stored in it overnight, having missed the last boat run to the mainland of the day.&lt;ref name="PD"/&gt; The examination table was never used to conduct an [[autopsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/factsnfig.htm|title=Facts|publisher=Alcatraz History.com|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its use by the [[U.S. Army]], deceased officers were originally taken to [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] and military cemetery on Angel Island, but after its closure in the early 1900s, officers would then be taken to the [[San Francisco National Cemetery]] in the [[Presidio of San Francisco]]. During Alcatraz's use as a [[Federal penitentiary]] from 1934 to 1963, deceased inmates were taken to the [[San Francisco County]] [[Coroner]] on the mainland.&lt;ref name="PD"/&gt;

[[File:Amadís de Gaula 1508.PNG|thumb|First surviving edition, 1508; University of California, Berkeley]]

'''''Amadís de Gaula''''' (original [[Old Spanish]] and [[Galician-Portuguese]] spelling; {{lang-es|Amadís de Gaula|links=no}}, {{IPA-es|amaˈðis ðe ˈɣaula|IPA}}; {{lang-pt|Amadis de Gaula|links=no}}, {{IPA-pt|ɐmɐˈdiʒ dɨ ˈɡawlɐ|IPA}}) is a landmark work among the [[chivalric romance]]s which were in vogue in sixteenth-century Spain, although its first version, much revised before printing, was written at the onset of the 14th century.

The earliest surviving edition of the known text, by [[Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo]] (not Ordóñez de Montalvo), was published in [[Zaragoza]] in 1508, although almost certainly there were earlier printed editions, now [[Lost works|lost]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Eisenberg and Maricarmen Marín Pina, ''Bibliografía de los libros de caballerías castellanos'', 2000, https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/Bibl_libros_de_caballerias/bibliography.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in four books in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but its origins are unclear: The narrative originates in the late [[Matter of Britain|post-Arthurian]] genre and had certainly been read as early as the 14th century by the [[chancellor]] [[Pero López de Ayala]] as well as his contemporary [[Pero Ferrús]].

Montalvo himself confesses to have amended the first three volumes, and to be the author of the fourth. Additionally, in the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Chronicle'' by [[Gomes Eannes de Azurara]] (1454), ''Amadis'' is attributed to [[Vasco de Lobeira]], who was knighted after the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]] (1385). However, although other sources claim that the work was, in fact, a copy of one [[João de Lobeira]], not [[troubadour]] Vasco de Lobeira, and that it was a translation into Castilian Spanish of an earlier work, probably from the beginning of the 14th century, no primitive version in the original Portuguese is known. The inspiration for the "Amadis de Gaula" appears to be the blocked marriage of [[Constance of Aragon, Lady of Villena|Infanta Constanza of Aragon]] with [[Henry of Castile the Senator|Henry of Castile]] in 1260 (see [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena|Juan Manuel]]'s ''{{ill|Libro de las tres razones|es}}'' of 1335), as blocked was also Oriana's marriage to Amadis. A more recent opinion attributes "Amadis" to Henry of Castile and León, due to evidence linking his biography with the events in "Amadis". Henry of Castile died in 1305.

In his introduction to the text, Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo explains that he has edited the first three books of a text in circulation since the 14th century. Montalvo also admits to adding a fourth as yet unpublished book as well as adding a continuation ([[Las sergas de Esplandián]]), which he claims was found in a buried chest in [[Constantinople]] and transported to Spain by a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] merchant (the famous motif of the [[false document|found manuscript]]).

==Characters and plot==
The story narrates the [[star-crossed]] love of King Perión of Gaula and Elisena of England, resulting in the secret birth of Amadís. [[Child abandonment|Abandoned]] at birth on a barge in England, the child is raised by the knight Gandales in Scotland and investigates his origins through fantastic adventures.

He is persecuted by the wizard Arcalaús, but protected by Urganda la Desconocida (Urganda the Unknown or Unrecognized), an ambiguous priestess with magical powers and a talent for prophecy. Knighted by his father King Perión, Amadís overcomes the challenges of the enchanted Insola Firme (a sort of peninsula), including passing through the Arch of Faithful Lovers.

Despite Amadís' celebrated fidelity, his childhood sweetheart, Oriana, heiress to the throne of Great Britain, becomes jealous of a rival princess and sends a letter to chastise Amadís. The knight (later famously parodied in ''[[Don Quixote]]'') changes his name to Beltenebros and indulges in a long period of madness on the isolated Peña Pobre.

He recovers his senses only when Oriana sends her maid to retrieve him. He then helps Oriana's father, Lisuarte, repel invaders. A short time later he and Oriana scandalously consummate their love. Their son Esplandián is the result of this one illicit meeting.

Rodríguez de Montalvo asserts that in the "original" ''Amadís'', Esplandián eventually kills his father for this offense against his mother's honor; however, Montalvo amends this defect and resolves their conflict peaceably.

Oriana and Amadís defer their marriage for many years due to enmity between Amadís and Oriana's father Lisuarte. Amadís absents himself from Britain for at least ten years, masquerading as "The Knight of the Green Sword". He travels as far as Constantinople and secures the favor of the child-princess Leonorina, who will become Esplandián's wife. His most famous adventure during this time of exile is the battle with the giant Endriago, a monster born of incest who exhales a poisonous reek and whose body is covered in scales.

As a knight, Amadís is [[courteous]], gentle, sensitive and a [[Christian]] who dares to defend free love. Unlike most literary heroes of his time (French and German, for example), Amadís is a handsome man who would cry if refused by his lady, but is invincible in battle and usually emerges drenched in his own and his opponent's blood.

==Literary significance==
Called also ''Amadís sin Tiempo'' (Amadis without Time) by his mother (in allusion to the fact that being conceived outside marriage she would have to abandon him and he would probably die), he is the most representative [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] hero of [[chivalric romance]]. His adventures ran to four volumes, probably the most popular such tales of their time. [[François de la Noue]], one of the Huguenot captains of the 16th century, affirmed that reading the romances of Amadis had caused a "spirit of vertigo"&lt;ref&gt;"Un espirit de vertige"; noted in [[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919) 1924:68.&lt;/ref&gt; even in his more rationally-minded generation. The books show a complete idealization and simplification of knight-errantry. Even servants are hardly heard of, but there are many princesses, ladies and kings. Knights and [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]] are found everywhere. The book's style is reasonably modern, but lacks dialogue and the character's impressions, mostly describing the action.

The book's [[literary genre|style]] was praised by the usually demanding [[Juan de Valdés]], although he considered that from time to time it was too low or too high a style. The language is characterized by a certain "Latinizing" influence in its [[syntax]], especially the tendency to place the [[verb]] at the end of the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]; as well as other such details, such as the use of the [[present participle]], which bring ''Amadís'' into line with the [[allegory|allegorical]] style of the 15th century.

Nevertheless, there is a breach of style when Garci Rodriguez de Montalvo presents the fourth book. It becomes dull and solemn, reflecting the nature of the intruding writer. The first three books are inspired in deeds and feats by knights-errant, dating back to the 13th century, while the fourth book emerges as a less brilliant attachment of the 15th century. The pristine style of "Amadís" can be perceived in the few original famous pages analyzed by Antonio Rodríguez Moñino: It is lively and straight to the facts of war and love, with brief dialogs, all quite elegant and amusing. ''Amadís of Gaula'' is frequently referenced in the humorous classic ''Don Quixote'', written by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] in the early 17th century. The character Don Quixote idolizes Amadís, and often compares his hero's adventures to his own.

Historically, ''Amadís'' was very influential amongst the Spanish [[conquistador]]es. [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] mentioned the wonders of ''Amadís'' when he marveled at his first sight of [[Tenochtitlan]] (modern Mexico City) – and such place names as [[Origin of the name California|California]] come directly from the work.

==Origins==
As mentioned above, the origin of Amadís and his adventures is disputed. Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo, a Spanish writer, is traditionally the author of the version whose earliest surviving edition is 1508. He claimed sole ownership only of Book IV. The existence of a prior version of Books I to III has been supported by Antonio Rodríguez Moñino's identification of four 15th-century manuscript fragments (ca. 1420). The name "Esplandián" is clearly visible in one of these. The fragments belong to the collection of the [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. They show that contrary to the usual view that Montalvo expanded the first three books, they show that he abbreviated them.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In the Spanish translation of [[Egidio Colonna]]'s ''De regimine principum'', ''Amadís'' is mentioned and also the poet Enrico, who could well be [[Henry of Castile the Senator|Enrico de Castiglia]]. Egidio Colonna was in Rome 1267 when Henry of Castile was elected Senator. The translation was made around 1350 under King Peter the Cruel. This is the oldest mention of ''Amadís''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The place called ''Gaula'' is a fictional kingdom within Brittany. It has in the past been identified with Wales or France, but it is best understood as a completely legendary place.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Place, "Amadis of Gaul, Wales, or What?", ''[[Hispanic Review]]'', 23 (1955), pp. 99–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the various theories of the work's origins, Rodríguez de Montalvo's Spanish version, as the only complete edition known, is considered definitive, and it was the one which made the character widely known on a European scale. Unfortunately Rodríguez de Montalvo allowed the original manuscript to disappear, and only a few pages of a lost prior version were discovered in Spain by Antonio Rodríguez-Moñino, and are now conserved at the University of California, Berkeley. These reveal that rather than enlarging on the source text, Montalvo abbreviated it.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Rodríguez-Moñino, "El primer manuscrito del ''Amadís de Gaula''. (Noticia bibliográfica)," in ''Boletín de la Real Academia Española'', 36 (1956), pp. 199–216, collected in his ''Relieves de erudición (del "Amadís" a Goya)''. Madrid: Castalia, 1959, pp. 17–38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels and translations==
''Amadís of Gaul's'' popularity was such that in the decades following its publication, dozens of [[sequel]]s of sometimes minor quality were published in Spanish, Italian, and German, together with a number of other imitative works. Montalvo himself cashed in with the continuation ''[[Las sergas de Esplandián]]'' (Book V), and the sequel-specialist [[Feliciano de Silva]] (also the author of ''Second Celestina'') added four more books including [[Amadis of Greece]] (Book IX). [[Miguel de Cervantes]] wrote ''[[Don Quixote]]'' as a burlesque attack on the resulting genre. Cervantes and his protagonist Quixote, however, keep the original ''Amadís'' in very high esteem.

The Spanish volumes, with their authors and the names of their main characters:
* Books I–IV: &lt;1508 (Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo): Amadís de Gaula
* Book V: 1510 (Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo): Esplandián
* Book VI: 1510 (Páez de Ribera) – this volume was universally maligned{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* Book VII: 1514 ([[Feliciano de Silva]]): Lisuarte de Grecia
* Book VIII: 1526 (Juan Díaz) – Diaz had Amadis die in this volume which was much criticized
* Book IX: 1530 (Feliciano de Silva): Amadis de Grecia ([[Amadis of Greece]])
* Book X: 1532 (Feliciano de Silva): Florisel de Niquea
* Book XI: 1535 &amp; 1551 (Feliciano de Silva): Rogel de Grecia
* Book XII: 1546 (Pedro de Luján): Silves de la Selva

The Italian Continuation:
* Books XIII–XVIII (Mambrino Roseo da Fabriano)

The German Continuation:
* Books XIX–XXI : 1594–5

In Germany and England, ''Amadís'' was known chiefly through its French translations, sometimes much revised, and in England the cycle was generally referred to by its French title ''Amadis de Gaule''. The French translations did not follow the Spanish book divisions exactly, and the entire cycle in the French version extends to 24 books. Note that the book numbers of the French translation do not always correspond to the book numbers of the Spanish originals, and in both languages, "book" is not the same as "printed volume"; physical printed books sometimes contained more than one "book" of the series.

French translations, with their translators:
* Book I: 1540 ([[Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts]])
* Book II: 1541 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts)
* Book III: 1542 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts)
* Book IV: 1543 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts)
* Book V: 1544 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts)
* (Spanish book VI was rejected as apocryphal)
* Book VI: 1545 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts) (actually Spanish Book VII)
* (Spanish Book VIII was rejected because it told of the death of Amadis)
* Book VII: 1546 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts) (actually Spanish Book IXa)
* Book VIII: 1548 (Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts) (actually Spanish Book IXb)
* Book IX: 1551 (Giles Boileau &amp; Claude Colet) (actually Spanish Book Xa)
* Book X: 1552 (Jacques Gohory) (actually Spanish Book Xb)
* Book XI: 1554 (Jacques Gohory) (actually Spanish Book XIa)
* Book XII: 1556 (Guillaume Aubert) (actually Spanish Book XIb)
* Book XIII: 1571 (Jacques Gohory) (actually Spanish Book XIIa)
* Book XIV: 1574 (Antoine Tyron) (actually Spanish Book XIIb)
* Books XV–XXI: 1576–1581
* Books XXII–XXIV: after 1594

In Portugal, and other parts of Iberia, the Amadis cycle also launched other adventure series, such as:
* ''Palmerin de Olivia'' (not "Oliva") – original anonymous text in Castilian: 1511
* ''Primaleon'' (son of Palmerin de Olivia) – original anonymous text in Castilian: 1512
* ''Palmeirim de Inglaterra'' (''Palmeirim of England'') – original Portuguese text by [[Francisco de Moraes|Francisco de Morais Cabral]]: c.1544 (published 1567)
* ''Dom Duardos'' – original Portuguese text by Diogo Fernandes
* ''Dom Clarisel de Bretanha'' – original Portuguese text by Gonçalves Lobato
* ''Crónica do Imperador Clarimundo'' (''Chronicle of Emperor Clarimund'') – original Portuguese text by [[João de Barros]]
* ''Sagramor'' – original Portuguese text by Gonçalo Fernandes Trancoso

'''Angie's List''' is an American home services website. Founded in 1995, it is an online directory that allows users to read and publish [[crowd-sourced]] reviews of local businesses and contractors. Formerly a subscription-only service, Angie's List added a free membership tier in July 2016.

For the [[Calendar year#Quarters|quarter]] ending on June 30, 2016, Angie's List reported total revenue of US$83,000,000 and a net income of US$4,797,000.&lt;ref name="YahooFinance2016"&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ANGI/financials?ltr=1], Yahoo Finance, August 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 2017, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that [[IAC (company)|IAC]] planned to buy Angie's List. By September 2017 the new publicly traded company was called ANGI Homeservices Inc.&lt;ref name=angieslist-buy&gt;{{cite news |last=Jamerson |first=Joshua |date= |title=IAC Plans to Buy Angie’s List  |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/iac-plans-to-buy-angies-list-1493672055?tesla=y | work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |location= |access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shares started trading in early October, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2017/10/02/coloradoshomeadvisor-and-angies-list-combine-into.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
William S. Oesterle and [[Angie Hicks]] founded Angie's List in 1995. The idea resulted from Hicks's search for a reliable [[general contractor|construction contractor]] in suburban [[Columbus, Ohio]], on behalf of Oesterle, a [[venture capital]]ist who was Hicks's boss. Hicks moved to Columbus to join Oesterle in creating Columbus Neighbors, a call-in service and publication with reviews of local home and lawn care services. The name and concept were based on Unified Neighbors in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. Hicks went door-to-door, signing up consumers as members and collecting ratings of local contractors.

After Hicks recruited over 1,000 members in Columbus within one year, she turned to Oesterle to raise money from investors to develop the business.&lt;ref name=NoFreeStuff&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the company bought Unified Neighbors from its creator and moved the company's headquarters to Indianapolis.

By 1999, the database of local services and reviews was moved to the Internet. In the following years, the customer base and business relationships grew throughout the United States, while expanding coverage to include additional services, such as health care and auto care.

In 2017, the company announced in a press release that they had 2 million subscribers in the year 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tamborello|first1=Joe|title=Angie's List boasts 5 million members, growth|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2017/01/16/angies-list-boasts-5-million-members-growth/96633758/|website=Indianapolis Star|language=en|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, it reported 3.2 million paid members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kopytoff|first1=Verne|title=Angie's List names former Best Buy executive as CEO|url=http://fortune.com/2015/09/08/angies-list-best-buy-durchslag/|website=Fortune|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Angie's List was made a [[freemium]] service; the basic membership tier, which includes access to more than 10 million reviews, was made free, alongside subscription tiers offering additional functionality.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-iacangi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/13/need-a-plumber-angies-list-reviews-are-now-free.html|title=Need a plumber?

==Ratings methodology==
Angie's List members grade companies using a report-card-style scale, which ranges from A to F; these ratings are based on the following criteria: price, quality, responsiveness, punctuality and professionalism.&lt;ref name=Hoovers&gt;{{cite web|last=Schein |first=Amy |title=Brownstone Publishing, LLC |work=Hoovers.com |publisher=[[Hoovers]] |url=http://premium.hoovers.com/subscribe/co/factsheet.xhtml?ID=rfkffhsjrfchyhx |accessdate=2007-01-30 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each company has its own page, which is composed of a description of its business along with the customer reviews. The aggregate grade is drawn from the combined reviews and grades given to the businesses from the consumers.


==Criticism and Controversies==
Angie's List states they don't have paid advertisements but also states that contractors can pay to offer a discount to Angie’s List members and those show up at the top of search pages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/5/27/1095283/-Angie-s-List-dishonest-business-model&lt;/ref&gt; "Angie’s List makes a big point to say they’re consumer-driven, when in fact 70% of their revenue comes from advertising. It’s not advertising Coca Cola, it’s advertising from the companies they rate,” explained Jeff Blyskal, a senior editor for Consumer Reports.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2013/09/18/why-consumer-reports-says-you-cant-trust-angies-list/&lt;/ref&gt;    

It was found out that Many Local 'Angie’s List Certified' Contractors Are Unlicensed to Do Work&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nbcchicago.com/investigations/Many-Local-Angies-List-Certified-Contractors-Are-Unlicensed-to-Do-Work-420965484.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[David Segal (reporter)|David Segal]] found that when subscribers post a negative review of a company to Angie's List, a staff member discusses it with the subscriber in an attempt to rectify the situation. After they "fix the problem" they will remove the complaint. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/your-money/a-complaint-registered-then-expunged.html?ref=thehaggler&amp;_r=0 |author=David Segal|title=A Complaint Registered, Then Expunged|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 21, 2013|page=BU3|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==
According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', in March 2007 SCS Contracting Group sued Angie's List and two members for libel because of negative reviews of the company. One of the sued members remarked, "if [contractors are] able to sue, then the value of Angie's List depreciates.... People aren't going to be willing to submit reviews if they could be threatened with a lawsuit."&lt;ref name=lawsuit&gt;{{Cite news

In 2014, Angie's List Inc. paid $2.8&amp;nbsp;million to settle a lawsuit alleging that it automatically renewed members at a higher rate than they were led to believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/angies-list-to-pay-28m-in-membership-fee-settlement/PARAMS/article/49636|title=Angie's List to pay $2.8M in membership-fee settlement|publisher=Ibl.com|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Angie’s List has agreed to settle three lawsuits for a payment of $1,400,000. The class action lawsuits focused on Angie’s List’s acceptance of advertising payments from service providers, and whether those payments affect service providers’ letter-grade ratings, reviews, and place in search-result rankings. Angie’s List denies plaintiffs’ claims, but disclosed that revenue from service providers can affect the order of search-result rankings of the service provider under certain settings.

==Financial information==
In 2010, Angie's List raised a total of $25&amp;nbsp;million in capital from investors. In September 2010, Wasatch Funds and [[Battery Ventures]] invested $22&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

On November 17, 2011, Angie's List began trading on the [[NASDAQ]] exchange under the ticker symbol ANGI. It priced 8.8M shares at $13 and opened for trading at $18, a 33% premium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/17/technology/angies_list_IPO/ | work=CNN | title=Angie's List gains 25% in IPO | date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, investors worried that the company had been in business for more than 18 years, yet never had shown an annual profit, and that valuations of the company were unrealistic based on the actual revenue the company produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/1776412-angies-list-worth-9-based-on-expected-lifetime-member-value-in-2015|title=Angie's List: Worth $9 Based On Expected Lifetime Member Value In 2015|date=October 26, 2013|publisher=Seekingalpha.com|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by 2015 growth estimates indicate a significant earnings-per-share growth, with a long-term growth rate at 19%. Combine this with stock estimates rising in 2015 by 13.3%, some [[Securities research]] firms such as Zacks Investment Research indicated ANGI is well-positioned for future earnings growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/195456/why-angies-list-angi-could-be-an-impressive-growth-stock|title=Why Angie's List (ANGI) Could Be an Impressive Growth Stock|date=October 28, 2015|publisher=zacks.com|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2017, [[IAC/InterActiveCorp]], owner of [[HomeAdvisor]], announced that it had agreed to acquire Angie's List for $8.50 per-share (valuing the company at over $500 million). IAC plans to merge Angie's List and HomeAdvisor into a new publicly traded subsidiary known as ANGI Homeservices.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-iacangi"&gt;{{cite web|title=IAC to Buy Angie’s List in Deal Valued at Over $500 Million|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-01/iac-to-acquire-angie-s-list-in-deal-valued-at-about-500-million|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Campbell Center for Historic Preservation Studies''' is an [[United States|American]] [[museum studies]] school located in [[Mount Carroll, Illinois|Mount Carroll]], [[Illinois]].

In 1979, the Center purchased the campus of [[Shimer College]], which had occupied the site from 1853 until moving cross-state to [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]]. The campus was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980. Classes began that summer.

The Center primarily offers summer-semester [[continuing education]] in the areas of [[historic preservation]], [[art conservation|conservation]], and collections care. In 2005, the Center initiated a [[Academic certificate|certificate]] program in [[preventive care]] of artifacts. The instructors are experienced professionals drawn from institutions and companies around the world, and students come from several countries as well.

On November 2, 2012, ground was broken for the Frances Wood Shimer Memorial Arboretum, named after Shimer College founder and first president [[Frances Shimer]], who planted thousands of trees around the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Carroll County Mirror-Democrat|title=Groundbreaking held for Frances Shimer Memorial Arboretum|date=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal dedication of the arboretum was set for June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalstandard.com/news/x776194332/Campbell-Center-celebrates-new-arboretum-June-8|work=Freeport Journal Standard|date=2013-05-26|accessdate=2013-05-26|title=Campbell Center celebrates new arboretum June 8|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629135917/http://www.journalstandard.com/news/x776194332/Campbell-Center-celebrates-new-arboretum-June-8#|archive-date=2013-06-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caribherp''' is an [[online database]] containing information on [[amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s of the [[Caribbean Islands]]. It was established in 1999 and serves as a resource for determining the species that occur on specific islands, viewing their distributions, and identifying them by images. Besides the primary search capability by regions and islands, the site features a global search functionality and the ability to refine lists by [[taxon]] and origin (endemic or introduced), and to sort by various features. Caribherp also includes [[Common name|common]] and [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]], sightings, images, videos, audio of frog calls, distribution maps, geographic regions, and [[conservation status]] provided by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org |website=www.iucnredlist.org |access-date=2016-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627000000/http://www.iucnredlist.org/ |archivedate=2014-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development and maintenance of Caribherp is accomplished through the work of [[Stephen Blair Hedges|S. Blair Hedges]] and his colleagues, and students from [[Penn State University]] and [[Temple University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Caribherp|url = http://caribherp.org|website = www.caribherp.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==

Caribherp contains approximately 2000 images and maps, and frog calls of selected species. The database currently contains roughly 750 reptile and amphibian species. With the addition of [[Trinidad]], [[Tobago]], the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC Islands]], and other Caribbean islands not included, this number would rise to approximately 1100 species. This is 6.2% of the roughly 17,820 species of amphibians (7,511 species)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AmphibiaWeb|url = http://amphibiaweb.org:8000/index.html|website = amphibiaweb.org:8000/index.html|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reptiles (10,309 species)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Reptile Database|url = http://www.reptile-database.org|website = www.reptile-database.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the world. New species are continually being discovered and described.

The '''Castrol performance index''' is a [[Ranking|ranking system]] created by [[Castrol]] for men's club association football as part of a sponsorship package with [[FIFA]]. The system uses [[Formula|mathematical formulas]] which evaluate various player performance in terms of how individual actions either assist or prevent goals. The system takes into account the strength of the opposition and the time in a game the player's actions occurred.

Castrol publishes several rankings: players in top five Euporean leagues monthly during a season, MLS player ranking and international tournament rankings. Castrol became the official oil lubricant of FIFA in 2008. It published a ranking in [[UEFA Euro 2008]]. It was an official sponsor the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa and an index measuring World Cup player performance was updated after each round of matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/marketing/releases/newsid=819436.html|title=Castrol joins forces with FIFA World Cup until 2014|date=30 June 2008|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castrol made a ranking in [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]&lt;ref&gt;UEFA.com: [http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/statistics/castroledge/ranking/index.html Full ranking].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;FIFA.com: [https://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/statistics/castrolindex/ranking.html Castrol Index Ranking]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castrol index ranking==
The Castrol Index is a rolling ranking system that measures performance of every football player across Europe's top five leagues during the course of a 12-month period. Rankings are published monthly.

To get Castrol Index Ranking, first "Castrol Index Score" is calculated for every player in every league and Champions league match, then the score weighted to get "Castrol Ranking points", and lastly, cumulative points from every match during the 12-month period are multiplied with 90 and divided by total minutes played.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castrolfootball.com/rankings/faq/|title=Castrol EDGE Rankings FAQ|date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weightings are different in every league and are adjusted after every season by strength of every league. For example, Champions league knock-out stage has biggest weight.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;


=== Top-rated players ===
Since the beginning of the ranking, September 2009,&lt;ref name="cronaldo"&gt;Castrol: [http://www.castrolfootball.com/article/2009/12/23/RONALDO-HEADS-THE/6606DC72-084C-11DF-BA6F-863CF76C26CD.php Ronaldo tops new Castrol Rankings].&lt;/ref&gt; there have been three players in the top position.

'''Claude''' is an [[Albinism in biology|albino]] alligator (''[[American alligator|Alligator mississippiensis]]'') at the [[California Academy of Sciences]]. Claude lacks the pigment [[melanin]], which results in his skin color. He also has poor eye-sight due to his albinism.&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt;

==Background==
Claude was born on 15 September 1995 in Florida weighing {{convert|2|oz|g}}.&lt;ref name="SFGate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Albino-alligator-Claude-to-mark-15th-birthday-3253032.php | title=Albino alligator Claude to mark 15th birthday | publisher=SFGate | date=14 September 2010 | accessdate=8 August 2015 | author=Guthrie, Julian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He weighs {{convert|222|lb|kg}} and is {{convert|9|ft|5|in|m}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abc7news.com/archive/9134317/ | title=Famous gator gets a check-up | date=10 June 2013 | accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has 76 teeth.&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt;

He was in danger in the wilderness owing to albinism which did not allow him to camouflage into his surroundings like other alligators. There are only a couple of dozen known albino alligators in the world, all in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albino alligator Claude to mark 15th birthday|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Albino-alligator-Claude-to-mark-15th-birthday-3253032.php#photo-2401962|website=SF gate|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claude was taken to the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt; Claude's toe was amputated after developing an infection from being bitten by another alligator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Tough-times-for-koi-continue-as-S-F-aquarium-6071694.php | title=Tough times for koi continue as S.F. aquarium looks to sever ties | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | date=9 February 2015 | accessdate=8 August 2015 | author=Rubenstein, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claude appears completely white because he lacks the pigment melanin. This is due to destruction of pigment-forming cells known as melanocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swamp|url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/the-swamp|website=California Academy of Sciences|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| '''Cause of the accident''' || The plants were not designed with consideration of such a large [[tsunami]]. A major [[2011 Tohoku earthquake|earthquake and tsunami]] caused the destruction of power lines and backup generators. Once the plants were without external power and the generators were flooded, a catastrophic [[decay heat]] casualty ensued, leading to major reactor plant damage including [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]]s and explosive loss of [[reactor containment]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} || Proximate cause was human error and violation of procedures. The unsafe reactor design caused instability at low power due to a positive [[void coefficient]] and steam formation. When an improper test was conducted at 1:00 am at low power, the reactor became [[prompt critical]]. This was followed by a [[steam explosion]] that exposed the fuel, a raging fire, and a [[core meltdown]]. The fire lasted for days to weeks, and there is controversy over whether it was the fuel burning, nuclear decay heating or whether the [[graphite]] moderator that made up most of the core was involved.  See [[Chernobyl Disaster]], Note 1, for more discussion.

'''Crimes against humanity''' are certain acts that are deliberately committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack or individual attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population. The first prosecution for crimes against humanity took place at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. Crimes against humanity have since been prosecuted by other international courts (for example, the [[International Court of Justice]], the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], and the [[International Criminal Court]]) as well as in domestic prosecutions. The law of crimes against humanity has primarily developed through the evolution of [[customary international law]]. Crimes against humanity are not codified in an international convention, although there is currently an international effort to establish such a treaty, led by the [[Crimes Against Humanity Initiative]].

Unlike [[war crime]]s, crimes against humanity can be committed during peace or war.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M. DeGuzman,[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1745183 "Crimes Against Humanity"] RESEARCH HANDBOOK ON INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW, Bartram S. Brown, ed., Edgar Elgar Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a [[de facto]] authority. [[War crime]]s, [[murder]], [[massacre]]s, [[dehumanization]], [[genocide]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[deportation]]s, [[unethical human experimentation]], [[extrajudicial punishment]]s including [[summary execution]]s, [[weapon of mass destruction|use of WMDs]], [[state terrorism]] or [[State-sponsored terrorism|state sponsoring of terrorism]], [[death squad]]s, [[kidnapping]]s and [[forced disappearance]]s, [[military use of children]], [[internment|unjust imprisonment]], [[slavery|enslavement]], [[cannibalism in humans|cannibalism]], [[torture]], [[rape]], [[political repression]], [[Institutional racism|racial discrimination]], [[religious persecution]], and other [[Human rights#Violations|human rights abuses]] may reach the threshold of crimes against humanity if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice.

==History of the term==

The term "crimes against humanity" is potentially [[ambiguous]] because of the ambiguity of the word "humanity", which can mean [[humankind]] (all human beings collectively) or [[humanity (virtue)|the value of humanness]]. The history of the term shows that the latter sense is intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Luban |title=A Theory of Crimes Against Humanity |url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/146/ |journal=[[The Yale Journal of International Law]] |volume=29 |number=1 |date=2004 |pages=85–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolition of the slave trade===
There were several bilateral treaties in 1814 that foreshadowed the multilateral treaty of [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna]] (1815) that used wording expressing condemnation of the [[slave trade]] using moral language. For example, the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] between Britain and France included the wording "principles of natural justice"; and the British and United States plenipotentiaries stated in the [[Treaty of Ghent (1814)]] that the slave trade violated the "principles of humanity and justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Francisco Forrest |year=2007 |title=The Constitution as Treaty: The International Legal Constructionalist Approach to the U.S. Constitution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139467186 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xNEjqp2A6ZgC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 101]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multilateral ''Declaration of the Powers, on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, of 8 February 1815'' (Which also formed [[s:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna/Act XV|Section XV]] of the [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of the same year) included in its first sentence the concept of the "principles of humanity and universal morality" as justification for ending a trade that was "odious in its continuance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Plenipotentiaries of the treaty |title=The Parliamentary Debates from the Year 1803 to the Present Time |publisher= s.n. |year=1816|volume=32 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=I8ETAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=P74#PPT24,M1 p. 200]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "crimes against humanity" was used by [[George Washington Williams]] in a pamphlet published in 1890 to describe the practices of [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s administration of the [[Congo Free State]].&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa. Houghton Mifflin, 1999. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In treaty law, the term originated in the Second Hague Convention of 1899 preamble and was expanded in the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 preamble and their respective regulations, which were concerned with the codification of new rules of [[international humanitarian law]]. The preamble of the two Conventions referenced the “laws of humanity” as an expression of underlying inarticulated humanistic values.&lt;ref&gt;Cherif Bassiouni, M. Crimes against Humanity: Historical Evolution and Contemporary Application. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The term is part of what is known as the [[Martens Clause]].

On May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers, Britain, France, and Russia, jointly issued a statement explicitly charging for the first time ever another government of committing "a crime against humanity". An excerpt from this joint statement reads:

{{quote|In view of these new crimes of [[Ottoman Empire]] against humanity and civilization, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Governments]] announce publicly to the [[Sublime Porte]] that they will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members of the [[Young Turks|Ottoman Government]], as well as those of their agents who are implicated in such massacres.&lt;ref&gt;1915 declaration

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the conclusion of the war, an international war crimes commission recommended the creation of a [[tribunal]] to try "violations of the laws of humanity". However, the US representative objected to references to "law of humanity" as being imprecise and insufficiently developed at that time and the concept was not pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cryer|first=Robert|title=An Introduction to International Criminal Law and Procedure|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=188|author2=Hakan Friman |author3=Darryl Robinson |author4=Elizabeth Wilmshurst }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuremberg trials===
{{Main article|Nuremberg trials}}
[[File:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nuremberg Trials. Defendants in the dock. The main target of the prosecution was [[Hermann Göring]] (at the left edge on the  first row of benches), considered to be the most important surviving official in the [[Nazi Germany|Third ''Reich'']] after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] death.]]

After the Second World War, the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] set down the laws and procedures by which the Nuremberg trials were to be conducted. The drafters of this document were faced with the problem of how to respond to [[the Holocaust]] and grave crimes committed by the [[Nazi regime]]. A traditional understanding of war crimes gave no provision for crimes committed by a power on its own citizens. Therefore, Article 6 of the Charter was drafted to include not only traditional war crimes and [[crime against peace|crimes against peace]], but also ''crimes against humanity'', defined as
{{quote|[[Murder]], extermination, [[Slavery|enslavement]], [[deportation]], and other [[wikt:inhumane|inhumane]] acts committed against any [[civilian]] population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuremberg War Crimes Trial: The Charter Provisions|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judprov.asp |website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Under this definition, crimes against humanity could only be punished insofar as they could be connected somehow to war crimes or crimes against peace.&lt;ref name=Hilberg1145/&gt; The jurisdictional limitation was explained by the American chief representative to the London Conference, [[Robert H. Jackson]], who pointed out that it "has been a general principle from time immemorial that the internal affairs of another government are not ordinarily our business". Thus, "it is justifiable that we interfere or attempt to bring retribution to individuals or to states only because the concentration camps and the deportations were in pursuance of a common plan or enterprise of making an unjust war".&lt;ref name=Hilberg1145&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilberg|first1=Raul|title=The Destruction of the European Jews|date=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300095579|edition=3rd|pages=1145–1147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgement of the first Nuremberg trial found that "the policy of persecution, repression and murder of civilians" and persecution of Jews within Germany before the outbreak of war in 1939 were not crimes against humanity, because as "revolting and horrible as many of these crimes were, it has not been satisfactorily proved that they were done in execution of, or in connection with," war crimes or crimes against peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judlawre.asp Judgement : The Law Relating to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity] contained in the [[Avalon Project]] archive at [[Yale Law School]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[subsequent Nuremberg trials]] were conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 which included a revised definition of crimes against humanity with a wider scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolfe |first1=Robert |title=Flaws in the Nuremberg Legacy: An Impediment to International War Crimes Tribunals' Prosecution of Crimes Against Humanity |journal=Holocaust and Genocide Studies |date=1 January 1998 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=443–444 |doi=10.1093/hgs/12.3.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tokyo Trial===
{{See also|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}

[[File:IMTFE defendants.jpg|thumb|300px|The defendants at the Tokyo International Tribunal.  General [[Hideki Tojo]] was one of the main defendants, and is in the centre of the middle row.]]

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), also known as the Tokyo Trial, was convened to [[criminal procedure|try]] the leaders of the [[Empire of Japan]] for three types of crimes: "Class A" ([[crimes against peace]]), "Class B" ([[war crime]]s), and "Class C" (crimes against humanity), committed during the Second World War.

The legal basis for the trial was established by the [[Tokyo Charter|Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (CIMTFE)]] that was proclaimed on 19 January 1946. The tribunal convened on May 3, 1946, and was adjourned on November 12, 1948.

In the Tokyo Trial, Crimes against Humanity  (Class C) was not applied for any suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshinobu Higurashi,Tokyo Saiban(Tokyo Trial),Kodansya-Gendai-Shinsho,Kodansha Limited,2008,p.26,pp.116-119.Hirohumi Hayashi,BC kyu Senpan Saiban,Iwanami Shoten Publishers,2005,p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Prosecutions related to the [[Nanking Massacre]] were categorised as infringements upon the [[Laws of War]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoshinobu Higurashi,op.cit.,pp.116-119.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A panel of eleven [[judge]]s presided over the IMTFE, one each from victorious Allied powers ([[United States]], [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], [[Soviet Union]], [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], [[British India]], and the [[Philippines]]).

==Types of crimes against humanity==
The different types of crimes which may constitute crimes against humanity differs between definitions both internationally and on the domestic level. Isolated inhumane acts of a certain nature committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack may instead constitute grave infringements of [[human rights]], or –&amp;nbsp;depending on the circumstances&amp;nbsp;– [[war crimes]], but are not classified as crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive - A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", Page 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apartheid===
{{Main article|Crime of apartheid}}

The systematic persecution of one racial group by another, such as occurred during the [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] government, was recognized as a crime against humanity by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/un/uncrime.htm International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011235327/http://www.anc.org.za/un/uncrime.htm |date=October 11, 2009 }} dopted and opened for signature, ratification by General Assembly resolution 3068 (XXVIII) of 30 November 1973. Entry into force 18 July 1976, in accordance with article X (10)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charter of the United Nations]] (Article 13, 14, 15) makes actions of the General Assembly advisory to the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html "Charter of the United Nations"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417093634/http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html |date=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to apartheid in particular, the UN General Assembly has not made any findings, nor have apartheid-related trials for crimes against humanity been conducted.

===Rape and sexual violence===
Neither the Nuremberg or Tokyo Charters contained an explicit provision recognizing sexual and gender-based crimes as war crimes or crimes against humanity, although Control Council Law No. 10 recognized rape as a crime against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia  and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda both included rape as a crime against humanity. The ICC is the first international instrument expressly to include various forms of sexual and gender-based crimes{{snd}} including rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation, and other forms of sexual violence{{snd}} as both an underlying act of crimes against humanity and war crime committed in international and/or non-international armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-Policy-Paper-on-Sexual-and-Gender-Based-Crimes--June-2014.pdf "ICC Prosecutor's Policy Paper on Sexual and Gender-Based Crimes"] June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, the events of [[Khojaly Massacre|Khojaly]] and [[Khatyn massacre|Khatyn]] can be shown that the world strongly condemns. International institutions have asked for a ransom to avoid such incidents. There are hundreds of massacres, thousands of prisoners and wounded in these incidents.

In 2008, the [[U.N.

In 2008, the [[Crimes Against Humanity Initiative]] was launched by Professor [[Leila Nadya Sadat]] at the [[Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute]] to address this gap in international law. The Initiative represents the first concerted effort to address the gap that exists in international criminal law by enumerating a comprehensive international convention on crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Gareth, [http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/speeches/2009/crimes-against-humanity-and-the-responsibility-to-protect.aspx "Crimes Against Humanity and the Responsibility to Protect"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105053758/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/speeches/2009/crimes-against-humanity-and-the-responsibility-to-protect.aspx |date=January 5, 2015 }} International Crisis Group&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2013, the United Nations [[International Law Commission]] voted to include the topic of crimes against humanity in its long-term program of work. In July 2014, the Commission moved this topic to its active programme of work&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Marcela Bailliet, [http://ilg2.org/2014/08/06/un-international-law-commission-to-elaborate-new-global-convention-on-crimes-against-humanity/ "UN International Law Commission to Elaborate New Global Convention on Crimes Against Humanity"] IntLawGrrls&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William A.

International Law Commission, Sixty-fifth session. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor Sean D. Murphy, the United States’ Member on the United Nations’ International Law Commission, has been named the Special Rapporteur for Crimes Against Humanity. Sean D. Murphy attended the 2008 Experts' Meeting held by the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative prior to this appointment.

There is some debate on what the status of crimes against humanity under customary international law is. M. Cherif Bassiouni argues that crimes against humanity are part of ''jus cogens'' and as such constitute a non-derogable rule of international law.&lt;ref name="Crimes Against Humanity"/&gt;

==United Nations==
The United Nations has been primarily responsible for the prosecution of crimes against humanity since it was chartered in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;https://undocs.org/A/RES/260(III)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nuremberg, there was no international court with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity for almost 50 years. Work continued on developing the definition of crimes against humanity at the United Nations, however. In 1947, the [[International Law Commission]] was charged by the United Nations General Assembly with the formulation of the principles of international law recognized and reinforced in the Nuremberg Charter and judgment, and with drafting a ‘code of offenses against the peace and security of mankind’. Completed fifty years later in 1996, the Draft Code defined crimes against humanity as various inhumane acts, i.e., "murder, extermination, torture, enslavement, persecution on political, racial, religious or ethnic grounds, institutionalized discrimination, arbitrary deportation or forcible transfer of population, arbitrary imprisonment, rape, enforced prostitution and other inhuman acts committed in a systematic manner or on a large scale and instigated or directed by a Government or by any organization or group." This definition differs from the one used in Nuremberg, where the criminal acts were to have been committed “before or during the war”, thus establishing a nexus between crimes against humanity and armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Crimes/CrimesAgainstHumanity#_ftnref1 |title=ICD - Crimes against humanity |publisher=Asser Institute |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report on the 2008–09 [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] by [[Richard Goldstone]] accused Palestinian and Israeli forces of possibly committing a crime against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8257301.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN condemns 'war crimes' in Gaza | date=16 September 2009 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Goldstone said that he no longer believed that Israeli forces had targeted civilians or committed a crime against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstone|first=Richard|title=Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and War Crimes|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=2 August 2012|date=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 2013, at its 22nd session, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] established the [[Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea|Commission of Inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea]] (DPRK). The Commission is mandated to investigate the systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with a view to ensuring full accountability, in particular for violations which may amount to crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/128/65/PDF/G1312865.pdf?OpenElement "Resolution A/HRC/RES/22/13: Situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829031840/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/128/65/PDF/G1312865.pdf?OpenElement |date=August 29, 2013 }} Human Rights Council&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission dealt with matters relating to crimes against humanity on the basis of definitions set out by customary international criminal law and in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;Report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea - A/HRC/25/63, available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/Documents.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425025103/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/Documents.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 Report by the commission found "the body of testimony and other information it received establishes that crimes against humanity have been committed in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the State... These crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation. The commission further finds that crimes against humanity are ongoing in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea because the policies, institutions and patterns of impunity that lie at their heart remain in place." Additionally, the commission found that crimes against humanity have been committed against starving populations, particularly during the 1990s, and are being committed against persons from other countries who were systematically abducted or denied repatriation, in order to gain labour and other skills for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

===Security Council===
[[UN Security Council Resolution 1674]], adopted by the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 28 April 2006, "reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 [[World Summit Outcome Document]] regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef!OpenDocument Resolution 1674 (2006)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223154915/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef%21OpenDocument |date=February 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|resolution]] commits the Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.

In 2008 the [[U.N. Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|resolution 1820]], which noted that “rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide”.&lt;ref name="Un.org"/&gt;

==International courts and criminal tribunals==
After the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials of 1945-1946, the next international tribunal with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity was not established for another five decades. In response to atrocities committed in the 1990s, multiple ad hoc tribunals were established with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugolavia and for Rwanda each contain different definitions of crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Peter, [http://www.icclr.law.ubc.ca/Site%20Map/ICC/AspectofCrimesAgainstHumanity.pdf "Aspect of Crimes Against Humanity and the International Criminal Court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021031709/http://www.icclr.law.ubc.ca/site%20map/icc/aspectofcrimesagainsthumanity.pdf |date=2012-10-21 }} International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia===
{{Main article|International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia}}

In 1993, the UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), with jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute three international crimes which had taken place in the former Yugoslavia: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Article 5 of the ICTY Statute states that {{quotation|The International Tribunal shall have the power to prosecute persons responsible for the following crimes when committed in armed conflict, whether international or internal in character, and directed against any civilian population:&lt;ref name="ICTY Statute"&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_sept09_en.pdf "ICTY Statute"] Article 5&lt;/ref&gt;

:(a) murder;
:(b) extermination;
:(c) enslavement;
:(d) deportation;
:(e) imprisonment;
:(f) torture;
:(g) rape;
:(h) persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds;
:(i) other inhumane acts."}}

This definition of crimes against humanity revived the original ‘Nuremberg’ nexus with armed conflict, connecting crimes against humanity to both international and non-international armed conflict. It also expanded the list of criminal acts used in Nuremberg to include imprisonment, torture and rape.&lt;ref name="ICTY Statute"/&gt; Cherif Bassiouni has argued that this definition was necessary as the conflict in the former Yugoslavia was considered to be a conflict of both an international and non-international nature. Therefore, this adjusted definition of crimes against humanity was necessary to afford the tribunal jurisdiction over this crime.&lt;ref&gt;Cherif Bassiouni, M. Crimes against Humanity: Historical Evolution and Contemporary Application. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda===
{{Main article|International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda}}

The UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994 following the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. Under the ICTR Statute, the link between crimes against humanity and an armed conflict of any kind was dropped. Rather, the requirement was added that the inhumane acts must be part of a “systematic or widespread attack against any civilian population on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icls.de/dokumente/ictr_statute.pdf "ICTR Statute"] Article 3&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the conflict in Rwanda was deemed to be non-international, so crimes against humanity would likely not have been applicable if the nexus to armed conflict had been maintained.

[[File:International Criminal Court Headquarters, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|right|278px|Headquarters of the ICC in The Hague]]

In 2002, the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) was established in [[The Hague]] (Netherlands) and the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] provides for the ICC to have jurisdiction over [[genocide]], crimes against humanity and war crimes. The definition of what is a "crime against humanity" for ICC proceedings has significantly broadened from its original legal definition or that used by the UN.&lt;ref name="crimesofwar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/crimes-against-humanity.html |title=Crimes Against Humanity |accessdate=2006-07-23 |author=Cherif Bassiouni |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718113035/http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/crimes-against-humanity.html |archivedate=2006-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the Rome Statute employs the same definition of crimes against humanity that the ICTR Statute does, minus the requirement that the attack was carried out ‘on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds’. In addition, the Rome Statute definition offers the most expansive list of specific criminal acts that may constitute crimes against humanity to date.

Article 7 of the treaty stated that:

{{quotation|For the purpose of this Statute, "crime against humanity" means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/icc/statute/part-a.htm#2 Rome statute of the International Criminal Court] Article 7: Crimes against humanity.

:(a) [[Homicide|Murder]];
:(b) Extermination;
:(c) [[Slavery|Enslavement]];
:(d) [[Population transfer|Deportation or forcible transfer of population]];
:(e) [[Imprisonment]] or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law;
:(f) [[Torture]];
:(g) [[War rape|Rape]], [[sexual slavery]], [[forced prostitution|enforced prostitution]], [[forced pregnancy]], [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], or any other form of [[sexual violence]] of comparable gravity;
:(h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, [[Human race|racial]], national, ethnic, [[Culture|cultural]], [[Religion|religious]], [[gender]] as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;
:(i) [[Forced disappearance|Enforced disappearance]] of persons;
:(j) The [[crime of apartheid]];
:(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health;}}

The [[Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum states that crimes against humanity
{{quotation|are particularly odious offenses in that they constitute a serious attack on human dignity or grave humiliation or a degradation of one or more human beings. They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority. However, murder, extermination, torture, rape, political, racial, or religious persecution and other inhumane acts reach the threshold of crimes against humanity only if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice. Isolated inhumane acts of this nature may constitute grave infringements of human rights, or depending on the circumstances, war crimes, but may fall short of meriting the stigma attaching to the category of crimes under discussion. On the other hand, an individual may be guilty of crimes against humanity even if he perpetrates one or two of the offences mentioned above, or engages in one such offense against only a few civilians, provided those offenses are part of a consistent pattern of misbehavior by a number of persons linked to that offender (for example, because they engage in armed action on the same side or because they are parties to a common plan or for any similar reason.) Consequently when one or more individuals are not accused of planning or carrying out a policy of inhumanity, but simply of perpetrating specific atrocities or vicious acts, in order to determine whether the necessary threshold is met one should use the following test: one ought to look at these atrocities or acts in their context and verify whether they may be regarded as part of an overall policy or a consistent pattern of an inhumanity, or whether they instead constitute isolated or sporadic acts of cruelty and wickedness.&lt;ref name="Horton2"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive - A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", p. 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To fall under the Rome Statute, a crime against humanity which is defined in Article 7.1 must be "part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population". Article 7.2.a states "For the purpose of paragraph 1: "Attack directed against any civilian population means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack." This means that an individual crime on its own, or even a number of such crimes, would not fall under the Rome Statute unless they were the result of a State policy or an organizational policy. This was confirmed by [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] in an open letter publishing his conclusions about allegations of crimes committed during the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 which might fall under the [[International Criminal Court|ICC]]. In a section entitled "Allegations concerning Genocide and Crimes against Humanity" he states that "the available information provided no reasonable indicator of the required elements for a crime against humanity," i.e. 'a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Luis Moreno Ocampo]]{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf |title=OTP letter to senders re Iraq |accessdate=2006-02-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225075607/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-25 |df= }}  9 February 2006.

The ICC can only prosecute crimes against humanity in situations under which it has jurisdiction. The ICC only has jurisdiction over crimes contained in its statute - genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity - which have been committed on the territory of a State party to the Rome Statute, when a non-party State refers a situation within its country to the court or when the United Nation Security Council refers a case to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/About+the+Court/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412060448/http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/About%2Bthe%2BCourt/ |archivedate=2011-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 the UN referred to the ICC the situation in Darfur.

The [[Committee of Ministers]] of the [[Council of Europe]] on 30 April 2002 issued a recommendation to the member states, on the protection of women against violence. In the section "Additional measures concerning violence in conflict and post-conflict situations", states in paragraph 69 that member states should: "penalize rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity as an intolerable violation of human rights, as crimes against humanity and, when committed in the context of an armed conflict, as war crimes;"&lt;ref&gt;[[Committee of Ministers]] of the [[Council of Europe]]: [http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec(2002)05.asp Recommendation (2002) 5]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127063047/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec%282002%2905.asp |date=November 27, 2006 }} Paragraph 69&lt;/ref&gt;

These acts consist of murder; annihilation; enslavement; bondage; forced removal of the population; imprisonment or deprivation of physical liberty that violates international laws; maltreatment; forced prostitution and rape; discrimination and tyranny against certain groups; apartheid (racial discrimination and segregation); and, other inhumane acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 1998|last=Pronto|first=Arnold N.|website=legal.un.org|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A publication from Trial International mentioned that crimes against humanity have been collated starting in 1990. These were the 1993 Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (now called the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 1994 Statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, and 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal.

The '''Earth Impact Database''' is a database of confirmed [[impact structure]]s or [[impact crater|crater]]s on [[Earth]]. It was initiated in 1955 by the [[Dominion Observatory]], Ottawa, under the direction of Dr. [[Carlyle Smith Beals|Carlyle S. Beals]]. Since 2001, it has been maintained as a not-for-profit source of information at the Planetary and Space Science Centre at the [[University of New Brunswick]], Canada.&lt;ref name="EID"&gt;{{cite web

{{As of|2016|08}}, the database lists 190 confirmed impact sites.&lt;ref name="EID" /&gt;

Other lists are wider in scope by including more than just confirmed sites, such as probable, possible, suspected and rejected or discredited impact sites on their lists.  These are used for screening and tracking study of possible impact sites.  The reason to retain rejected sites on such a list is because they may be, and often are, reported again.  Sites will appear first in these lists while under study and may be incorporated into UNB's Earth Impact Database after confirmation and collection of enough information about the site to satisfy the database's strict entry criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''EULYNX''' is a [[Europe]]an initiative in the area of [[railway signalling]], with the aim of reducing the cost and installation time of signalling equipment. Currently, there are 12 members from North and Central Europe, with baseline 1 published in March 2017 and baseline 2 published in December 2017. The project documents lay down a system architecture for [[interlocking]] systems, including [[Standardization|standard]] [[Technical standard|interfaces]] for the individual interlocking components, that can be used in any of the participating countries. The objective is to turn interlockings into modular systems, where different parts of one interlocking can be supplied by different manufacturers while maintaining the high safety and reliability levels required of a [[Safety-critical system|critical]] [[Rail transport|railway]] safety system.

== Introduction ==
EULYNX was started in 2014 by the [[Railway infrastructure manager|railway infrastructure managers]] of 6 European countries: [[DB Netze|Germany]], [[ProRail|Netherlands]], [[Infrabel|Belgium]], [[Réseau Ferré de France|France]], [[Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois|Luxembourg]] and [[Network Rail|Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irse.org/knowledge/publicirsenews/IRSE%20News%20198%20Mar%2014%20with%20watermark.pdf|title=Beyond ETCS  – Interoperable interfaces and more|last=Elsweiler|first=Bernd|date=March 2014|website=IRSE news|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has expanded with time to 12 by including the railway infrastructure managers from: [[Finnish Transport Agency|Finland]], [[Bane NOR|Norway]], [[Swedish Transport Administration|Sweden]], [[SŽ-Infrastructure|Slovenia]], [[Swiss Federal Railways|Switzerland]] and [[Rete Ferroviaria Italiana|Italy]]. The project is meant to [[Standardization|standardise]] railway signalling and [[Signalling control|control]] interfaces, in order to reduce cost and installation time of signalling equipment.

EULYNX stems from the shorter lifetime of new signalling equipment technology, especially of interlockings which are at the core of the railway safety system.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eulynx.eu/|title=EULYNX Homepage|last=|first=|date=|website=EULYNX|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interlocking system using mechanical technology could be expected to last up to 80 years but electronic interlocking equipment has a shorter lifetime, between 15 and 20 years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/blogs/david-briginshaw/get-ready-for-the-next-signalling-revolution.html|title=Get ready for the next signalling revolution|last=Briginshaw|first=David|date=29 Sep 2017|work=International Railway Journal|access-date=28 Jun 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high cost of railway signalling equipment and the fact that until recently, suppliers operated mostly within national borders, resulted in a significant amount of technological diversity, and elements installed over many decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When there is the need to install a new interlocking system core, this might not be compatible with the old field elements, such as [[Railway signal|signals]] and [[level crossing]] protection systems, forcing a substitution of elements that are still decades away from their expected end of lifecycle. Mergers and acquisitions in the supplying industry also mean less competition which can be another factor driving up costs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By standardising the system architecture and interfaces of railway signalling equipment,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/signalling/sbb-joins-eulynx-signalling-initiative.html|title=SBB joins Eulynx signalling initiative|last=Briginshaw|first=David|date=28 Jun 2017|work=International Railway Journal|access-date=28 Jul 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lifecycle of the interlocking core can be decoupled from the field elements, which have longer lifecycles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalrailwayreview.com/article/28395/issue-4-2016-digital-version/|title=EULYNX: a route to standardisation|last=|first=|date=28 Jul 2017|work=Global Railway Review|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; changing the traditional business logic of using a complete system from one manufacturer. Furthermore, the [[intellectual property]] (IP) rights of the specifications belongs to the project partners,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; contrary to when buying off the shelf products. The use of this approach enables manufacturers to bid for only a particular component, thereby lowering entry costs and increasing opportunities for competition. Furthermore, when a component has to be replaced, any company can supply that particular product.

=== Aims ===
EULYNX aims to reinforce the process of defining and standardising interfaces in the future railway digital control command communication, signalling and automation system&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The process of [[digitization]] in the railway industry provides a huge opportunity to reduce costs by improving efficiency, streamlining processes and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.railjournal.com/opinion/digitalisation-the-new-driver-of-railway-technology|title=Digitalisation: the new driver of railway technology|last=Briginshaw|first=David|date=4 Jan 2018|website=International Railway Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major goal is to increase the [[Route capacity|railway capacity]] and reliability with a significant reduction in the life-cycle cost of the system.

=== Implementation ===
The technical documents are published in stages, with baseline 1, covering [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization|CENELEC]] phases 1 - 4/5 published in 31 of March 2017 and baseline 2 published in December 2017, at the moment the consortium is working on the development of the state machines corresponding to the baseline 2 requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eulynx.eu/index.php/home2/21-baseline-1-released|title=Baseline 1 released|last=|first=|date=|website=EULYNX webpage|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the specifications are [https://eulynx.eu/index.php/documents/published-documents/open-availability openly available] and the more detailed specifications require a previous registration.

[[Bane NOR]] the Norwegian railway infrastructure manager has introduced EULYNX requirements in its [[European Rail Traffic Management System|ERTMS]] expansion programme, including equipping rolling stock and installing its whole network with [[ETCS Level 2|ETCS level 2]] signalling system. Both the signalling system and the traffic management system are now required to have EULYNX interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eulynx.eu/index.php/home2/25-bane-nors-ertms-natioanl-implementation-program|title=Bane NOR's ERTMS National Implementation program|last=|first=|date=30 July 2017|website=EULYNX homepage|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SŽ-Infrastructure]] has also announced the roll-out of EULYNX-compliant equipment in Slovenia after 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eulynx.eu/index.php/home2/23-slovenia-sets-a-date-for-eulynx-rollout|title=Slovenia sets a date for EULYNX rollout|last=|first=|date=30 July 2017|website=EULYNX homepage|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DB Netz is in a pre-series phase until 2019, using EULYNX requirements in ongoing signalling projects, while the specifications are completed. Production phase will follow&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irse.org/knowledge/publicirsenews/160120a%20irse%20news%20219%20final%20reduced%20size.pdf|title=IRSE Technical Visit to Braunschweig, Germany|last=Nicholson|first=David|date=February 2016|work=IRSE news|access-date=30 July 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other effects ===
EULYNX uses [[formal methods]] which are essential in other high-tech industries but not used widely by the railway infrastructure managers. The introduction of a distributed safety system is also pioneering in the sector, leading the way for other projects that need to go through a similar certification process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Fleming v Securities Commission''' [1995] 2 NZLR 514 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding negligent cases against the government.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Between 1987 and 1988, finance company Star Investments, placed adverts for deposits in 2 Taranaki newspapers. These adverts were illegal under the Securities Act on numerous grounds. A concerned local solicitor contacted the Securities Commission, and they commenced an investigation, resulting in the Commission advising both the company and the newspaper to cease advertising of the securities.

Despite this, the advertisements continued, until the company later collapsed.

Three of the investors sued both the securities Commission and the newspaper

==Held==
The court of appeal rejected their claim.

World-renowned for its collections in the fields of photography and cinema, the museum is also a leader in [[film preservation]] and [[photograph conservation]], educating archivists and conservators from around the world.  Home to the 500-seat [[Dryden Theatre]], the museum is located on the estate of entrepreneur and philanthropist [[George Eastman]], the founder of [[Eastman Kodak]] Company. The estate was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1966.

==History==
[[File:GeorgeEastmanHouse.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]

The Rochester estate of [[George Eastman]] (1854–1932) was bequeathed upon his death to the [[University of Rochester]].  University presidents (first [[Benjamin Rush Rhees]], then [[Alan Valentine]]) occupied Eastman's mansion as a residence for ten years.&lt;ref name="D&amp;C_Nov10"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chao|first=Mary|title=Historic houses are finding new lives in Rochester|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20101122/NEWS01/11220309/Historic-houses-are-finding-new-lives-in-Rochester&amp;referrer=NEWSFRONTCAROUSEL|accessdate=November 22, 2010|newspaper=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|date=November 22, 2010|agency=[[Gannett Company]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRRSF4c1?url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20101122/NEWS01/11220309/Historic-houses-are-finding-new-lives-in-Rochester%26referrer%3DNEWSFRONTCAROUSEL|archivedate=November 22, 2010|location=[[Rochester, New York]]|pages=1A, 4A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the university transferred the property to the museum and the [[Georgian Revival architecture|Georgian Revival Style]] mansion was adapted to serve the museum's operations.&lt;ref name="GEH1" /&gt;

George Eastman House was chartered as a museum in 1947.&lt;ref name="Image"&gt;{{cite news|first=Beaumont |last=Newhall |title=The First Decade |date=September–December 1982 |publisher=Image; Journal of Photography and Motion Pictures of the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House (Vol. 25, No. 3–4) |url=http://image.eastmanhouse.org/files/GEH_1982_25_03-04.pdf |pages=3 |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725164403/http://image.eastmanhouse.org/files/GEH_1982_25_03-04.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset, the museum's mission has been to collect, preserve, and present the history of [[photography]] and [[film]]. The museum opened its doors on November 9, 1949, displaying its core collections in the former public rooms of Eastman's house. In October 2015, the museum changed its name from ''George Eastman House'' to the ''George Eastman Museum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Eastman Museum Announces New Name {{!}} George Eastman Museum|url=http://www.eastman.org/george-eastman-museum-announces-new-name|accessdate=2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum's original collections included the Medicus collection of [[Photography and photographers of the American Civil War|Civil War photographs]] by [[Alexander Gardner (photographer)|Alexander Gardner]], Eastman Kodak Company's historical collection, and the massive Gabriel Cromer collection of nineteenth-century French photography. The Eastman Museum has received donations of entire archives, corporate and individual collections, and the estates of leading photographers, as well as thousands of [[Film|motion picture]]s and massive holdings of cinematic [[ephemera]].

By 1984, the museum's holdings were considered by many to be among the world's finest, but with the collections growing at a rapid pace, the museum was increasingly burdened by its own success. Additional space became critical to store and study the increasing number of collected objects. The museum's expansion facility opened to the public in January 1989.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kathleen |last=Quigley |title=Splendor Restored At Eastman House |date=1990-03-18 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/18/travel/splendor-restored-at-eastman-house.html |work =The New York Times |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the George Eastman Museum launched the Mellon Advanced Residency Program in [[Photograph conservation|Photograph Conservation]], made possible with grant support from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]. The program trained top photograph archivists and conservators from around the world.

In 1996, the museum opened the Louis B. Mayer Conservation Center in nearby [[Chili, New York]]. One of only four film conservation centers in the United States (as of March 2006), the facility houses the museum's rare [[35 mm]] prints made on [[cellulose nitrate]]. That same year, the Eastman House launched the first school of [[film preservation]] in the United States to teach restoration, preservation, and archiving of motion pictures. The L. Jeffrey Selznick School of Film Preservation was founded with support from The Louis B. Mayer Foundation.

George Eastman Museum has organized numerous groundbreaking exhibitions, including ''[[New Topographics|New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape]]'' in 1975.

===Board of Trustees===
The George Eastman Museum is headed by a board of trustees. Kevin Gavagan is the current chair of board.

===Finances===
The George Eastman Museum's annual budget is approximately $10 million.  As of December 2014, its endowment exceeded $35 million.

==Collections==
The museum's holdings comprise more than 400,000 [[photograph]]s and [[Negative (photography)|negative]]s dating from the invention of photography to the present day; 28,000 motion picture films; three million other cinematic objects, including letters, scripts, musical scores, lobby cards, posters, film stills, and celebrity portraits; more than 16,000 objects of photographic and cinematographic [[technology]]; an internationally renowned research collection of books, periodicals, and other materials on photography and moving images; and George Eastman's home furnishings and decorative arts, personal and business correspondence, private library, photographs, negatives, films, and related personal items.

===Photography collection===
[[File:A&amp;P, COFFEE, SANTA CLAUS.jpg|thumb|"A&amp;P, COFFEE, SANTA CLAUS", 1958, photograph by [[Nickolas Muray]]]]
The photography collection embraces numerous landmark processes, objects of great rarity, and monuments of art history that trace the evolution of the medium as a technology, as a means of scientific and historical documentation, and as one of the most potent and accessible means of personal expression of the modern era. More than 14,000 photographers are represented in the collection, including virtually all the major figures in the history of the medium. The collection includes original vintage works produced by nearly every process and printing medium employed. Notable holdings include:
* One of the world's largest collection of daguerreotypes, including more than 1,000 by [[Southworth &amp; Hawes]]
* A major collection of nineteenth-century photographs of the American West by photographers including [[Carleton Watkins]], [[Eadweard Muybridge]], [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]], and [[William Henry Jackson]]
* A major collection of ca. 1890s–1910s glass negatives from French photojournalist [[Charles Chusseau-Flaviens]]
* The photographic estates of [[Lewis Hine]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Nickolas Muray]] and [[Victor Keppler]]
* A major collection of [[Ansel Adams]]’ early and vintage prints

The museum's collection includes works by leading contemporary artists, including [[Andy Warhol]], [[Candida Höfer]], [[David Levinthal]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Adam Fuss]], [[Vik Muniz]], [[Gillian Wearing]], [[Ori Gersht]], [[Mickalene Thomas]], Chris McCaw, and Matthew Brandt.

===Moving image collection===
The [[George Eastman House Motion Picture Collection|George Eastman Museum Motion Picture Collection]] is one of the major moving image archives in the United States. It was established in 1949 by the first curator of film, [[James Card]] (1915–2000) who helped to build the George Eastman Museum as a leading force in the field with holdings of over 25,000 titles and a collection of stills, posters and papers with over 3 million artifacts.  The George Eastman Museum's collection includes the complete moving-image works of [[William Kentridge]].

===George Eastman Legacy Collection===
This collection includes George Eastman's house and the George Eastman Archive and Study Center.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Who's behind the scenes at the Eastman House|last=|first=|date=18 Apr 1999|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opened in April 1999,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=When the archive opens, you, too, can poke through Eastman's possessions|last=Fennessy|first=Steve|date=28 Mar 1999|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the George Eastman Archive and Study Center contains Eastman's personal possessions and documents pertaining to Kodak's early history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Museums|last=|first=|date=1 May 2003|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has over half a million items&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; within its climate controlled vault.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The archive is accessible from the second floor of the house.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Items within the house itself include fragments of Eastman's coffin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=George Eastman House|last=|first=|date=27 Feb 2000|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mounted elephant head,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Museum as Home|last=|first=|date=21 Jan 1990|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Aeolian-Skinner|Aeolian]] pipe organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Donation to Eastman to help restore organ|last=Dobbin|first=Sean|date=5 May 2012|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==George Eastman Awards==

The George Eastman Museum established the [[George Eastman Award]] for distinguished contribution to the art of film in 1955 as the first award given by an American film archive and museum to honor artistic work of enduring value.

==George Eastman's Estate==
[[George Eastman]] built his residence at 900 East Avenue between 1902 and 1905. He created a unique urban estate complete with {{convert|10.5|acre|m2}} of working farm land, formal gardens, greenhouses, stables, barns, pastures, and a {{convert|35000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, 50-room [[Colonial Revival]] mansion with a fireproof structure made of reinforced concrete.

Eastman's house presented a neoclassical [[Georgian Revival architecture|Georgian Revival]] [[facade]] of decorative craftsmanship. Beneath this exterior were such modern conveniences as an [[electrical generator]], an internal telephone system with 21 stations, a built-in vacuum cleaning system, a central clock network, an [[elevator]], and a great Aeolian [[pipe organ]]. Eastman used the house as a center of the city's rich musical life from 1905 until his death in 1932.

The estate was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="nhlsum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: George Eastman House|url={{NHLS url|id=66000529}} |format=pdf|author=Richard Greenwood |date=January 8, 1976|publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=66000529|title=Accompanying 2 photos, 1 exterior from 1905 and 1 interior from 1920.|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(518&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grace Nicholson''' (December 31, 1877 – August 31, 1948) was an American art collector and art dealer, specializing in [[Native American art|Native American]] and Chinese handicrafts.  The space she originally designed for her shop is now home to the [[USC Pacific Asia Museum]] in [[Pasadena, California]].

==Early life and education==
Grace Nicholson was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], daughter of Franklin Nicholson and Rose Dennington Nicholson.  Her father was an attorney, and her mother trained as an educator.  Rose Nicholson died from complications following Grace's birth; when Grace was a teen, her father also died, and she was sent to live with her paternal grandparents.  They both died in 1901, leaving her an inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf787005cq/ Finding Aid, Grace Nicholson Papers, Huntington Library.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson attended [[Philadelphia High School for Girls]], graduating in the class of 1896.  She briefly worked as a stenographer after high school.&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda Packer (1994). "Grace Nicholson: An Entrepreneur of Culture," ''Southern California Quarterly'' 76(3): 309–310.  DOI: 10.2307/41171730&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Indian basket collection of Miss Grace Nicholson, ca.1900 (CHS-2139).jpg|thumb|Indian basket collection of Miss Grace Nicholson, ca.1900 (CHS-2139)]]
In 1901, using her inheritance, Nicholson moved to California, and soon opened a small shop in Pasadena, selling [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] handicrafts such as baskets and weaving.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6hZ7afQJQw4C&amp;lpg=PA118 Erika Marie Bsumek (2003). "Exchanging Places:  Virtual Tourism, Vicarious Travel, and the Consumption of Southwestern Indian Artifacts," in Hal Rothman, ed. ''The Culture of Tourism, the Tourism of Culture:  Selling the Past to the Present in the American Southwest'' (UNM Press):  118–139.] {{ISBN|0826329284}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She hired crafters to teach traditional beadwork and other skills; she rented space to local artists. She traveled extensively in the rural western and Southwestern United States, worked with local dealers to build her collection, and corresponded with East Coast collectors to sell the objects.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Usner (2012). "ASE Address 2011:  An Ethnohistory of Things:  Or, How to Treat California's Canastromania," ''Ethnohistory'' 56(3)(Summer): 441v463.&lt;/ref&gt;  She personally photographed and catalogued her holdings; she also built an extensive photographic record beyond the objects, especially of the [[Klamath River]] people, with whom she had frequent dealings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FAZ43yXhTfIC&amp;lpg=PA151 Susan Bernardin (2003).

(143).&lt;/ref&gt; She developed longterm relationships with some favorite crafters, well beyond ordinary business dealings:  she paid for eye surgery for one ailing basketmaker,&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com"&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/token-of-appreciation-180940700/?no-ist Ed Liebowitz, "Token of Appreciation: A Grateful Pomo Indian's Gift to a Friend Exemplifies the Brightest Form of Native American Artistry," ''Smithsonian Magazine''(August 2004).]&lt;/ref&gt; and paid college tuition for another young woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.humboldt.edu/humco/holdings/HoverAid.htm Hover Photograph Collection-Finding Aid, Humboldt State University Library Special Collections.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson acquired artifacts for sale, but also for major museums such as the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]] in [[Chicago]].  She lectured about "the Indian" to churches and civic groups. In recognition of her expertise, Nicholson was elected to the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda Packer and Tamar Frankiel (1995).  "Natural Sympathies:  Anglo Women and Indians in the West, 1895–1920," ''International Social Science Review'' 70(3&amp;4): 69.&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the "Anthropological Society," she joined a tour group that visited horticulturist [[Luther Burbank]] in 1905, in [[Santa Rosa, California]].&lt;ref&gt;"Scientists See Burbank's Work: Members of Anthropological Society Visit Horticulturist at his Santa Rosa Home," ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (September 2, 1905):  3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, she was awarded a silver medal at the [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] in [[Seattle]], for a display of baskets and other artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/reportcalifornia00calirich Report, California Alaska-Yukon Pacific Exposition Commission (1910)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PacAsianMuseum.jpg|thumbnail|The Grace Nicholson Building in Pasadena, California, home of the [[USC Pacific Asia Museum]]]]In 1924, she designed a new building for her collections, which (reflective of changing fashions) had begun to focus on Asian art.&lt;ref name="pacificasia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ren194kADK0C&amp;lpg=PA257 Suzanne Loebl (2002).

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' regularly included Nicholson's gallery in listings of local art events. Notable artists whose work was presented under her supervision include Honolulu-based [[Frank Montague Moore]],&lt;ref&gt;"Display of Hawaiian Paintings Announced," ''Los Angeles Times'' (February 25, 1928): A5.&lt;/ref&gt; Southwestern painter [[Joseph Henry Sharp]],&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, "Of Art and Artists: The Wanderer; The Week in the Local Galleries," ''Los Angeles Times'' (15 March 1925): 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Danish silversmith [[Georg Jensen]],&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, "Of Art and Artists: The Pier," ''Los Angeles Times''(March 22, 1925):  34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Victor Higgins]],&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, "Three Exhibits at Grace Nicholson's," ''Los Angeles Times'' (March 14, 1926): C19.&lt;/ref&gt; watercolorist [[Pop Hart]],&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Millier, "Art and Artists: Of Interest to Artists," ''Los Angeles Times'' (October 9, 1927):  30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil Fuchs (artist)|Emil Fuchs]],&lt;ref&gt;"Art Exhibitions in the Southland," ''Los Angeles Times'' (December 11, 1927): C32.&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch cartoonist [[Gustave Verbeek]],&lt;ref&gt;"Art and Artists: Current Art Exhibitions," ''Los Angeles Times'' (December 2, 1928): C25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grace Hudson]],&lt;ref&gt;"Current Art Exhibitions," ''Los Angeles Times'' (April 7, 1929): C16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agnes Lawrence Pelton]],&lt;ref&gt;"Age and Youth From East to West," ''Los Angeles Times'' (May 19, 1929): 18.&lt;/ref&gt; undersea painter [[Zarh Pritchard]], and Irish-born illustrator [[Power O'Malley]].&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, "Of Art and Artists," ''Los Angeles Times'' (January 3, 1926):  C26.&lt;/ref&gt;  She hosted an especially eclectic display of European [[tapestries]] and Persian [[pottery]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;"Art and Artists:  Great Exhibit in Pasadena; a Group of Old Tapestries/ Rare Coptic, Persian, and Chinese Ceramics; the Jaehne Collection of Japanese Crafts," ''Los Angeles Times'' (March 18, 1928):  C16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grainger Museum''' is a repository of items documenting the life, career and music of the composer, folklorist, educator and pianist [[Percy Grainger]] (b. Melbourne, 1882; d. White Plains, New York, 1961), located in the grounds of the [[University of Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. 

In the early 1920s, Grainger began to develop an idea for an autobiographical museum so that "all very intimate letters or notes should be deposited in an Australian Grainger Museum, preferably in birth-town Melbourne".&lt;ref&gt;Percy Grainger, letter to Balfour Gardiner, 3 May 1922 (Grainger Museum Collection)&lt;/ref&gt; Grainger was a [[Linguistic purism in English|linguistic purist]], advocating for the use of a 'Blue-Eyed English' derived from [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] and Germanic glossary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Article/261050,percy-grainger-s-hall-of-mirrors.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he generally used the word 'past-hoard-house' for museums,&lt;ref&gt;http://grainger.unimelb.edu.au/about/publications&lt;/ref&gt; but agreed to the word 'museum' in this case.

== Architecture ==
The Museum was designed by the University's staff architect John Gawler of the local firm Gawler and Drummond, with input and funding from Grainger himself.  It was built between 1935 and 1939 on land provided for the purpose by the University of Melbourne, and officially opened in December 1938.&lt;ref&gt;George Tibbits, 'Building the Grainger Museum', in Talking Grainger, edited by Kate Darian-Smith and Alessandro Servadei, The Australian Centre and the Grainger Museum, University of Melbourne, 1998, pp. 45-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed specifically to fulfill the role envisioned by Grainger, it is the only purpose-built autobiographical museum in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://recollections.nma.gov.au/issues/vol_6_no_2/exhibition_reviews/grainger_museum&lt;/ref&gt; The building is included on the [[Register of the National Estate]], the [[Victorian Heritage Register]] and with the [[National Trust of Australia (Victoria)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=[Grainger Museum : programs and related material collected by the National Library of Australia]|date=1900|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/17561879|language=English|accessdate=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grainger Museum was closed in 2003 for seven years, for restoration and conservation work, after waterproofing issues were detected. It reopened on 15&amp;nbsp;October 2010.
== The collection ==
Among displays of original manuscripts and published scores, musical instruments, field recordings, artworks, photographs, books and personal items, are Grainger’s whips and other items relating to his sado-masochism (which Grainger called the "Lust Branch"), the contents of his bedside cabinet, and a gallery devoted to his mother’s suicide.  There are also sound-making devices Grainger used to make his innovative and experimental "Free music".

The substantial archival collection includes some 50,000 items of correspondence (Grainger corresponded with people such as [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Frederick Delius]], [[Cyril Scott]], [[Roger Quilter]] and [[Julius Röntgen]], and collected letters of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] among others). The collection generally comprises over 100,000 items in total, only a small proportion of which are on display.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/org/1155/about/ Collections Australia Network]&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of the collection is accessible for research by prior arrangement.

== Opening hours ==
Sunday to Friday: 12:00pm – 4:00pm. Saturday: Closed. The Grainger Museum is closed on public holidays and from Christmas throughout the month of January each year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39865">{{Linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]], the '''head directionality ''' is a proposed [[Principles and parameters|parameter]] that classifies languages according to whether they are '''head-initial''' (the [[head (linguistics)|head]] of a [[phrase]] precedes its  [[Complement (linguistics)|complements]]) or '''head-final''' (the head follows its complements). The head is the element that determines the category of a phrase: for example, in a [[verb phrase]], the head is a verb.

Some languages are consistently head-initial or head-final at all phrasal levels. [[English grammar|English]] is considered to be strongly head-initial, while [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is an example of a language that is consistently head-final. In certain other languages, such as [[German language|German]] and [[Gbe languages|Gbe]], examples of both types of head direction occur. Various theories have been proposed to explain such variation.

Head directionality is connected with the type of [[branching (linguistics)|branching]] that predominates in a language: head-initial structures are ''right-branching'', while head-final structures are ''left-branching''.

== Types of phrase ==
There are various types of phrase in which the ordering of head and complement(s) may be considered when attempting to determine the head directionality of a language, including:
#[[Verb phrase]] (VP). Here the head is a [[verb]], and the complement(s) are most commonly [[object (grammar)|object]]s of various types. The ordering here is related to one of the chief questions in the [[word order]] typology of languages, namely the normal order of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], verb and object within a [[clause (grammar)|clause]] (languages are classed on this basis as [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]], SOV, VSO, etc.). 
#[[Noun phrase]] (NP). Here the head is a [[noun]]; various kinds of complementizer phrase and adpositional phrase may be considered to be complements.
#[[Adjective phrase]] (AP). This contains an adjective as the head, and can take as a complement, for example, an [[adverbial phrase]] or adpositional phrase.
# [[Adpositional phrase]] (PP). Such phrases are called prepositional phrases if they are head-initial (i.e. headed by a preposition), or postpositional phrases if they are head-final (i.e. headed by a postposition). For more on these, see [[Preposition and postposition]]. The complement is a determiner phrase (or noun phrase, depending on analytical scheme followed).
# [[Determiner phrase]] (DP). This has a [[determiner]] as the head of the phrase. DPs were proposed under generative syntax;{{sfn|Szabolcsi|1983}} not all theories of syntax agree that they exist.{{sfn|Van Langendonck|1994}} 
#[[Complementizer phrase]] (CP). This contains a [[complementizer]], like ''that'' in English, as the head. In some cases the head is [[covert (linguistics)|covert]] (not overtly present). The complement can be considered to be a tense phrase.
#[[Tense phrase]] (TP) and [[aspect phrase]] (AspP). These are phrases in which the head is an abstract [[syntactic category|category]] representing [[grammatical tense|tense]] or [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]; the complement is a verb phrase. In more traditional analysis the entire phrase (including any elements denoting tense or aspect) is considered to be simply a verb phrase.

In some cases, particularly with noun and adjective phrases, it is not always clear which dependents are to be classed as complements, and which as [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]s. Although in principle the head-directionality parameter concerns the order of heads and complements only, considerations of head-initiality and head-finality sometimes take account of the position of the head in the phrase as a whole, including adjuncts. The structure of the various types of phrase is analyzed below in relation to specific languages, with a focus on the ordering of head and complement. In some cases (such as English and Japanese) this ordering is found to be the same in practically all types of phrase, whereas in others (such as German and Gbe) the pattern is less consistent. Different theoretical explanations of these inconsistencies are discussed later in the article.

==Particular languages==

===English===
[[English grammar|English]] is a strongly head-initial language. In a typical verb phrase, for example, the verb precedes its complements, as in the following example:{{sfn|Fukui|1994|p=4}}
[[File:VP English.png|framed|right|English VP structure]]
:''eat an apple''
:[&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;'''V'''&lt;/sub&gt; '''eat'''] [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; an apple]]

The head of the phrase (the verb ''eat'') precedes its complement (the determiner phrase ''an apple''). Switching the order to "[&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; an apple] [&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; eat]]" would be ungrammatical.

Nouns also tend to precede any complements, as in the following example, where the [[relative clause]] (or [[complementizer phrase]]) that follows the noun may be considered to be a complement:{{sfn|Smith|1964|p=6}}
[[File:NP English.png|thumb|Syntax tree for head initial noun in English|framed|right|English NP structure]]
:''He married a girl who is from Texas.''
:[&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; '''girl'''] [&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; who is from Texas]]

Nouns do not necessarily begin their phrase; they may be preceded by [[attributive adjective]]s, but these are regarded as [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]s rather than complements. (For preceding [[determiner]]s, see below.) Adjectives themselves may be preceded by adjuncts, namely [[adverb]]s, as in ''extremely happy''.{{sfn|Sadler &amp; Arnold|1994|pp=28–34}} However, when an adjective phrase contains a true complement, such as a prepositional phrase, the head adjective precedes it:{{sfn|Sadler &amp; Arnold|1994|pp=28}}
:''a person happy about her work''
:[&lt;sub&gt;AP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sub&gt; '''happy'''] [&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; about her work]]

English adpositional phrases are also head-initial; that is, English has [[preposition]]s rather than postpositions:{{sfn|Gillion|1992|p=15}}
[[File:PP English.png|framed|right|English PP structure]]
:''a majority of eligible voters''
:[&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;'''P'''&lt;/sub&gt; '''of'''] [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; eligible voters]]

On the [[determiner phrase]] (DP) view, where a [[determiner]] is taken to be the head of its phrase (rather than the associated noun), English can be seen to be head-initial in this type of phrase too. In the following example{{sfn|Takahashi|2002|p=2}} the head is taken to be the determiner ''any'', and the complement is the noun (phrase) ''book'':

[[File:DP English.png|framed|right|English DP structure]]
:''any book''
:[&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;'''D'''&lt;/sub&gt; '''any'''] [&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; book]]

English also has head-initial [[complementizer phrase]]s, as in this example{{sfn|Sells|1995|p=4}} where the complementizer ''that'' precedes its complement, the tense phrase ''Mary did not swim'':
:''We saw that Mary did not swim''
:[&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; '''that'''] [&lt;sub&gt;TP&lt;/sub&gt; Mary did not swim]]

Grammatical words marking tense and aspect generally precede the semantic verb. This indicates that, if finite verb phrases are analyzed as [[tense phrase]]s or aspect phrases, these are again head-initial in English. In the example above, ''did'' is considered a ([[past tense|past]]) tense marker, and precedes its complement, the verb phrase ''not swim''. In the following, ''has'' is a ([[perfect aspect|perfect]]) aspect marker;{{sfn|Lin|2003|p=2}} again it appears before the verb (phrase) which is its complement.
[[File:AsP English.png|thumb|right|English AspP Structure]]
:''John has arrived''
:[&lt;sub&gt;AspP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;Asp&lt;/sub&gt; '''has'''] [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; arrived]]

The following example shows a sequence of nested phrases in which each head precedes its complement.{{sfn|Sportiche|Koopman|Stabler|2014}} In the [[complementizer phrase]] (CP) in (a), the complementizer (C) precedes its tense phrase (TP) complement. In the [[tense phrase]] in (b), the [[grammatical tense|tense]]-marking element (T) precedes its verb phrase (VP) complement. (The subject of the tense phrase, ''the girl'', is a [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]], which does not need to be considered when analyzing the ordering of head and complement.) In the [[verb phrase]] in (c), the verb (V) precedes its two complements, namely the determiner phrase (DP) ''the book'' and the prepositional phrase (PP) ''on the table''. In (d), where ''a picture'' is analyzed as a determiner phrase, the determiner (D) ''a'' precedes its noun phrase (NP) complement, while in (e), the [[preposition]] (P) ''on'' precedes its DP complement ''your desk''.
:''You know that the girl will put a picture on your desk.''

===German===
[[German grammar|German]], while being predominantly head-initial, is less conclusively so than in the case of English. German also features certain head-final structures. For example, in a [[nonfinite verb|nonfinite]] verb phrase the verb is final. In a finite verb phrase (or tense/aspect phrase) the verb (tense/aspect) is initial, although it may move to final position in a [[subordinate clause]]. In the following example,{{sfn|Dopke|1998|p=6}} the verb phrase ''es finden'' is head-final, whereas the tense phrase ''werde es finden'' (headed by the [[auxiliary verb]] ''werde'' indicating [[future tense]]) is head-initial. 
[[File:VP Head Final German.png|thumb|Syntax tree for head final verb phrase in German|framed|right|German VP structure]]
:''Ich werde es finden''
:I   will  it find
:"I will find it."
:[&lt;sub&gt;TP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; '''werde'''] [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; es] [&lt;sub&gt;'''V'''&lt;/sub&gt; '''finden''']]]

Noun phrases containing complements are head-initial; in this example{{sfn|Berthold|2005|p=6}} the complement, the CP ''der den Befehl überbrachte'', follows the head noun ''Boten''.
:''Man beschimpfte den Boten,    der den Befehl  überbrachte''
:one insulted    the messenger who the command delivered
:"The messenger, who delivered the command, was insulted."
:[&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; '''Boten'''] [&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; der den Befehl überbrachte]]

Adjective phrases may be head-final or head-initial. In the next example the adjective (''stolze'') follows its complement (''auf seine Kinder'').{{sfn|Hinterhölzl|2010|p=4}}
[[File:AP Final German.png|thumb|Syntax tree for head final adjective in German|right|German head-final AP Structure]]
:''der auf seine Kinder stolze Vater''
:the of his children proud father
:"the father (who is) proud of his children"
:[&lt;sub&gt;AP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; auf seine Kinder] [&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; '''stolze''']]

However, when essentially the same adjective phrase is used [[predicative adjective|predicatvely]] rather than attributively, it becomes head-initial:{{sfn|Hinterhölzl|2010|p=5}}
[[File:AP Initial German.png|thumb|right|German head-initial AP Structure]]
:''weil er stolz auf seine Kinder ist''
:since he proud of his children is
:"since he is proud of his children"
:[&lt;sub&gt;AP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; '''stolz'''] [&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; auf seine Kinder]]

Most adpositional phrases are head-initial (as German has mostly prepositions rather than postpositions), as in the following example, where ''auf'' comes before its complement ''den Tisch'':{{sfn|Van Riemsdijk|2007|p=3}}
[[File:PP Initial German.png|thumb|right|German head-initial PP structure]]
:''Peter legt das Buch auf den Tisch''
:Peter puts the book on the.ACC table
:"Peter puts the book on the table."
:[&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; '''auf'''] [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; den Tisch]]

German also has some [[postposition]]s, however (such as ''gegenüber'' "opposite"), and so adpositional phrases can also sometimes be head-final. Another example is provided by the analysis of the following sentence:{{sfn|Van Riemsdijk|2007|p=1}} 
:''Die Schnecke kroch das Dach hinauf''
:the snail crept the roof up
:"The snail crept up the roof"
:[&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; das Dach] [&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; '''hinauf''']]

Like in English, determiner phrases and complementizer phrases in German are head-initial. The next example is of a determiner phrase, headed by the article ''der'':{{sfn|Bianchi|1999|p=251}}
[[File:CP German.png|thumb|right|German CP Structure]]
:''der Mann''
:the man
:"the man"
:[&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; '''der'''] [&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; Mann]]

In the following example, the complementizer ''dass'' precedes the tense phrase which serves as its complement:{{sfn|Kathol|2001|p=1}}
:''dass Lisa eine Blume gepflanzt hat''
:that Lisa a flower planted has
:"that Lisa planted a flower"
:[&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; '''dass'''] [&lt;sub&gt;TP&lt;/sub&gt; Lisa eine Blume gepflanzt hat]]

===Japanese===
Japanese is an example of a strongly head-final language. This can be seen in verb phrases and tense phrases: the verb (''tabe'' in the example) comes after its complement, while the tense marker (''ru'') comes after the whole verb phrase which is its complement.{{sfn|Fukui|1994|p=4}}
[[File:VP Japanese.png|framed|right|Japanese VP structure]]
:''ringo-o   tabe-ru''
:apple-ACC eat-NONPAST
:"eat an apple"
:[&lt;sub&gt;TP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; ringo-o] [&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; '''tabe''']] [&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; '''ru''']]

Nouns also typically come after any complements, as in the following example where the PP ''New York-de-no'' may be regarded as a complement:{{sfn|Naoki|1993|pp=15–16}}
[[File:NP Japanese.png|thumb|Syntax tree for head final noun in Japanese|framed|right|Japanese NP structure]]
:''John-no  kinoo-no      New York-de-no  koogi''
:John-GEN yesterday-GEN New York-in-GEN lecture
:"John's lecture in New York yesterday"
:[&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; New York-de-no] [&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; '''koogi''']]

Adjectives also follow any complements they may have. In this example the complement of quantity, ''ni-juu-meetoro'' ("twenty meters"), precedes the head adjective ''takai'' ("tall"):{{sfn|Watanabe|2011|pp=9–10}}
:''Kono biru-wa      ni-juu-meetoru takai''
:this building-TOPIC two-ten-meter  tall
:"This building is twenty meters taller."
:[&lt;sub&gt;AP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt; ni-juu-meetoru] [&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; '''takai''']]

Japanese uses postpositions rather than prepositions, so its adpositional phrases are again head-final:{{sfn|Vinka|2009|p=4}}
[[File:PP Japanese.png|thumb|Syntax tree for head final preposition in Japanese|framed|right|Japanese PP structure]]
:''Boku-ga Takasu-mura-ni    sunde-iru''
:I-NOM   Takasu-village-in live-PRES
:"I live in Takasu village."
:[&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; Takasu-mura] [&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; '''ni''']]

Determiner phrases are head-final as well:{{sfn|Takahashi|2002|p=2}}
[[File:DP Japanese.png|framed|right|Japanese DP structure]]
:''dare mo''
:person any
:"anyone"
:[&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; dare] [&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; '''mo''']]

A complementizer (here ''to'', equivalent to English "that") comes after its complement (here a tense phrase meaning "Mary did not swim"), thus Japanese complementizer phrases are head-final:{{sfn|Sells|1995|p=4}} 
:''Mary-ga  oyog-ana-katta-to''
:Mary-NOM swim-NEG-PAST-that
:"that Mary did not swim"
:[&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;TP&lt;/sub&gt; Mary-ga oyog-ana-katta] [&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; '''to''']]

===Chinese===
[[Standard Chinese]] (whose syntax is typical of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] generally) features a mixture of head-final and head-initial structures. Noun phrases are head-final. Modifiers virtually always precede the noun they modify. For examples of this involving relative clauses, see [[Relative clause#Mandarin|Relative clause § Mandarin]].

In the case of strict head/complement ordering, however, Chinese appears to be head-initial. Verbs normally precede their objects. Both prepositions and postpositions are reported, but the postpositions can be analyzed as a type of noun (the prepositions are often called [[coverb]]s). For more details and examples of the relevant structures, see [[Chinese grammar]]. For a head-direction analysis of Chinese aspect phrases, see the theoretical section below.

===Gbe===
In [[Gbe languages|Gbe]], a mixture of head-initial and head-final structures is found. For example, a verb may appear after or before its complement, which means that both head-initial and head-final verb phrases occur.{{sfn|Aboh|2001|pp=1–2}} In the first example the verb for "use" appears after its complement:
:''Kɔ̀jó tó     àmí lɔ́  zân''
:Kojo IMPERF oil DET use
:"Kojo is using the oil."
:[&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; àmí lɔ́] [&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; '''zân''']]

In the second example the verb precedes the complement:
:''Kɔ̀jó nɔ̀  zán      àmí lɔ́''
:Kojo HAB use-PERF oil DET
:"Kojo habitually used the oil/Kojo habitually uses the oil."
:[&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; '''zán'''] [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; àmí lɔ́]]

It has been debated whether the first example is due to object [[syntactic movement|movement]] to the left side of the verb {{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=2}} or whether the lexical entry of the verb simply allows head-initial and head-final structures.{{sfn|Kinyalolo|1992|pp=1–16}}

Tense phrases and aspect phrases are head-initial since aspect markers (such as ''tó'' and ''nɔ̀ '' above) and tense markers (such as the future marker ''ná'' in the following example, but that does not apply to tense markers shown by verb [[inflection]]) come before the verb phrase.{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=34}}
:''dàwé lɔ̀   ná xɔ̀   kɛ̀kɛ́''
:man DET FUT buy bicycle
:"The man will buy a bicycle."
:[&lt;sub&gt;TP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; '''ná'''] [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; xɔ̀ kɛ̀kɛ́]]

Gbe noun phrases are typically head-final, as in this example:{{sfn|Brousseau &amp; Lumsden|1992|p=4}}
[[File:NP Gbe.png|thumb|Syntax tree for head final noun phrase in Gbe|framed|right|Gbe NP structure]]
:''Kɔ̀kú sín  ɖìdè   lɛ̀''
:Koku-CASE sketch-PL
:"sketches of Koku"
:[&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;KP&lt;/sub&gt; Kɔ̀kú sín] [&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; '''ɖìdè''']]

In the following example of an adjective phrase, Gbe follows a head-initial pattern, as the head ''yù'' precedes the [[intensifier]] ''tàùú''.{{sfn|Aboh|2004}}
[[File:AP Gbe.png|thumb|right|Gbe AP structure]]
:''àǔn  yù tàùú''
:dog black-Int
:"really black dogs"
:[&lt;sub&gt;AP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; '''yù'''] [&lt;sub&gt;Int&lt;/sub&gt; tàùú]]

Gbe adpositional phrases are head-initial, with prepositions preceding their complement:{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=117}}
:''Kòfi     zé        kwɛ́      xlán  Àsíbá"
:Kofi   take-PERF money    to Asiba
:"Kofi sent money to Asiba."
:[&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; '''xlán'''] [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; Àsíbá]]

Determiner phrases, however, are head-final:{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=100}}
[[File:CP Gbe.png|thumb|right|Gbe CP structure]]
:''Asíbá   xɔ̀        àvɔ̀   àmàmú  màtàn-màtàn        ɖé''
:Asiba buy-PERF cloth   green    odd             DEF
:"Asiba bought a specific ugly green cloth"
:[&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; àvɔ̀ àmàmú màtàn-màtàn] [&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; '''ɖé''']]

Complementizer phrases are head-initial:{{sfn|Aboh|2001|p=348}} 
:''ɖé   Dòsà    gbá      xwé   ɔ̀        ɔ̀''
:that Dosa build-PERF house DEF DET
:"that Dosa built the house"
:[&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; '''ɖé'''] [&lt;sub&gt;TP&lt;/sub&gt; Dòsà gb xwé ɔ̀ ɔ̀]]

==Theoretical views==
The idea that syntactic structures reduce to binary relations was introduced by [[Lucien Tesnière]] within the framework of [[dependency grammar|dependency theory]], which was developed during the 1960s. Tesnière distinguished two structures that differ in the placement of the structurally governing element ([[head (grammar)|head]]):{{sfn|Graffi|2001|pp=197–198}} '''centripetal structures''', in which heads precede their [[dependent (grammar)|dependent]]s, and '''centrifugal structures''', in which heads follow their dependents. Dependents here may include [[complement (grammar)|complement]]s, [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]], and [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]]s.

[[Joseph Greenberg]], who worked in the field of [[language typology]], put forward an implicational theory of [[word order]], whereby:{{sfn|Elordieta|2014|p=2}}
*If a language has VO (verb-before-object) ordering, then it will also have [[preposition]]s (rather than postpositions), and genitives and adjectives will be placed after the noun they modify.
*If a language has OV ordering, then it will also have postpositions, and genitives and adjectives will be placed before the noun they modify.
The first set of properties make heads come at the start of their phrases, while the second set make heads come at the end. However, it has been claimed that many languages (such as [[Basque language|Basque]]) do not fulfill the above conditions, and that Greenberg's theory fails to predict the exceptions.{{sfn|Elordieta|2014|p=5}}

[[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[Principles and Parameters theory]] in the 1980s{{sfn|Chomsky|1981}} introduced the idea that a small number of innate principles are common to every human language (e.g. phrases are oriented around heads), and that these general principles are subject to parametric variation (e.g. the order of heads and other phrasal components may differ). In this theory, the dependency relation between heads, complements, specifiers, and adjuncts is regulated by [[X-bar theory]], proposed by Jackendoff{{sfn|Jackendoff|1977}} in the 1970s. The complement is sister to the head, and they can be ordered in one of two ways. A head-complement order is called a '''head-initial structure''', while a complement-head order is called a '''head-final structure'''. These are special cases of Tesnière's centripetal and centrifugal structures, since here only complements are considered, whereas Tesnière considered all types of dependents.

In the principles and parameters theory, a head-directionality parameter is proposed as a way of [[linguistic typology|classifying languages]]. A language which has head-initial structures is considered to be a '''head-initial language''', and one which has head-final structures is considered to be a '''head-final language'''. It is found, however, that very few, if any, languages are entirely one direction or the other. Linguists have come up with a number of theories to explain the inconsistencies, sometimes positing a more consistent [[underlying representation|underlying]] order, with the phenomenon of phrasal [[syntactic movement|movement]] being used to explain the surface deviations.

According to the [[Antisymmetry]] theory proposed by [[Richard Kayne]], there is no head-directionality parameter as such: it is claimed that at an underlying level, all languages are head-initial. In fact, it is argued that all languages have the underlying order Specifier-Head-Complement. Deviations from this order are accounted for by different [[syntactic movement]]s applied by languages. Kayne argues that a theory that allows both directionalities would imply an absence of [[asymmetry|asymmetries]] between languages, whereas in fact languages fail to be symmetrical in many respects. Kayne argues using the concept of a probe-goal search (based on the ideas of the [[Minimalist program]]), whereby a [[Head (linguistics)|head]] acts as a probe and looks for a goal, namely its [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]. Kayne proposes that the direction of the probe-goal search must share the direction of language [[parsing]] and production.{{sfn|Kayne|2011|p=12}} Parsing and production proceed in a left-to-right direction: the beginning of sentence is heard or spoken first, and the end of the sentence is heard or spoken last. This implies (according to the theory) an ordering whereby probe comes before goal, i.e. head precedes complement.

Some linguists have rejected the conclusions of the Antisymmetry approach. Some have pointed out that in predominantly head-final languages such as [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] and [[Basque grammar|Basque]], the change from an underlying head-initial form to a largely head-final surface form would involve complex and massive leftward movement, which is not in accordance with the ideal of grammatical simplicity.{{sfn|Elordieta|2014|p=5}} Some take a "surface true" viewpoint: that analysis of head direction must take place at the level of [[surface form|surface derivations]], or even the [[Phonetic Form]] (PF), i.e. the order in which sentences are pronounced in natural speech. This rejects the idea of an underlying ordering which is then subject to movement, as posited in Antisymmetry and in certain other approaches. It has been argued that a head parameter must only reside at PF, as it is unmaintainable in its original form as a structural parameter.{{sfn|Richards|2008|p=283}}

Some linguists have provided evidence which may be taken to support Kayne's scheme, such as Lin,{{sfn|Lin|2006}} who considered Standard Chinese sentences with the [[Chinese grammar#Particles|sentence-final particle]] ''le''. Certain restrictions on movement from within verb phrases preceding such a particle are found (if various other assumptions from the literature are accepted) to be consistent with the idea that the verb phrase has moved from its underlying position after its head (the particle ''le'' here being taken as the head of an [[aspect phrase]]). However, Takita (2009) observes that similar restrictions do not apply in Japanese, in spite of its surface head-final character, concluding that if Lin's assumptions are correct, then Japanese must be considered to be a true head-final language, contrary to the main tenet of Antisymmetry.{{sfn|Takita|2009|pp=59}} More details about these arguments can be found in the [[Antisymmetry]] article.

==Statistical classifications==

Some scholars, such as Tesnière, argue that there are no absolute head-initial or head-final languages. According to this approach, it is true that some languages have more head-initial or head-final elements than other languages do, but almost any language contains both head-initial and head-final elements.  Therefore, rather than being classifiable into fixed categories, languages can be arranged on a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]] with head-initial and head-final as the extremes, based on the frequency distribution of their [[Dependency grammar|dependency]] directions. This view was supported in a study by Haitao Liu (2010), who investigated 20 languages using a dependency [[treebank]]-based method.{{sfn|Liu|2010|pp=1567–1578}} For instance, Japanese is close to the head-final end of the continuum, while English and German, which have mixed head-initial and head-final dependencies, are plotted in relatively intermediate positions on the continuum.

Polinsky (2012) identified the following five head-directionality sub-types:
* Rigid head-final languages, including [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]];
* Non-rigid head-final languages, including [[Latin]], [[German language|German]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Tsez language|Tsez]] and [[Avar language|Avar]];
* Clearly head-initial languages, including [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Tongan language|Tongan]] and most [[Mayan languages]];
* "SVO/head-initial" languages, including [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Yucatec Mayan]];
* "SVO sundry", including [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], the [[Romance languages]] and [[Bantu languages]].

She identified a strong correlation between the head-directionality type of a language and the ratio of verbs to nouns in the lexical inventory. Languages with a scarcity of simple verbs tend to be rigidly head-final, as in the case of Japanese, whereas verb-rich languages tend to be head-initial languages.{{sfn|Polinsky|2012|pp=348-359}}

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Height discrimination''' (also known as '''heightism''') is [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] against individuals based on [[Human height|height]]. In principle, it refers to discriminatory treatment against individuals whose height is not within the normal acceptable range of height in a population. Height discrimination is most common against shorter than average men and is generally accepted and ignored.&lt;ref name="judgecable"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Judge | first1 = A.

Research indicates that the human brain uses height as a measurement to determine social status and fitness. The brain automatically associates physical size with leadership potential, power, strength and intelligence, an effect which has been discovered in infants as young as 10 months old. Evolutionary psychologists theorise that this is due to height indicating that the individual had been better fed, indicating higher social status and thus resources available to them, as well as indicating general health and physical strength, the latter of which can be useful in asserting dominance. The automatic association between height and the aforementioned traits has also been found to be much stronger when it comes to assessing men than women.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Blaker, Irene Rompa, Inge Dessing, Anne Vriend, Channah Herschberg, Mark van Vugt, (2013) [http://professormarkvanvugt.com/images/files/heighlteadeshipGPIR.pdf "The height leadership advantage in men and women: Testing evolutionary psychology predictions about the perceptions of tall leaders"], DOI: 10.1177/1368430212437211, accessed 05/12/17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stulp G., Buunk A.

==Origin of the term==
The term ''height bigot'' was first used on the Mary Tyler Moore episode 7 of season 1 in October 1970. Mary is asked out by a charming, intelligent but very short man. Despite having a good time with him on a date she’s apprehensive about going out with him again because of his height. She declares herself a “height bigot” to her friend Rhoda.

The term ''heightism'' was coined by sociologist Saul Feldman in a paper titled "The presentation of shortness in everyday life—height and heightism in American society: Toward a sociology of stature", presented at the meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Saul. "The presentation of shortness in everyday life—height and heightism in American society: Toward a sociology of stature
Paper". Presented at the meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]]. [[Chicago, Il]]. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;heightism, n." [[OED Online]]. June 2003. [[Oxford University Press]]. September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heightism'' was included in the ''[[Second Barnhart Dictionary of New English]]'' (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although ''Time'' itself objected to the term's inclusion in the 1991 ''Random Webster's College Dictionary'', citing it as an example of the dictionary "straining ... to avoid giving offense, except to good usage" and "[lending] authority to scores of questionable usages, many of them tinged with [[politically correct]] views."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The term ''heightism'' can also be seen as an example of the increase in popular usage of phrases, particularly those relating to prejudice and discrimination, patterned after that of the word ''[[sexism]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Height and social discrimination==

===Employment wage and social experience discrimination===

A research paper published in the Journal of Applied Psychology showed that height is strongly related to success for men. It showed that increase in height for men corresponds to increase in income after controlling for other social psychological variables like age and weight.&lt;ref name="judgecable"/&gt; Economists [[Nicola Persico]], Andrew Postlewaite and Dan Silverman explained the "height premium" and found that "a 1.8-percent increase in wages accompanies every additional inch of height". They also found that men's wages as adults could be linked to their height at age 16. The researchers found that on an average an increase in height by one inch at age 16 increased male adult wages by 2.6 percent. This is equal to increase of approximately $850 in 1996 annual earnings. In other words, the height and corresponding social experiences of taller male adolescent at age 16 would likely translate to higher wage in later adulthood as compared to shorter male adolescent.&lt;ref name="PPS"/&gt;

As with all correlations, there may be other factors at work. For example, several epidemiological studies have shown a statistically significant positive correlation between [[height and intelligence]] in human populations. However, this correlation, though statistically significant, is generally weak and does not imply that variations in stature have a direct effect on cognitive ability. Though significant correlations have been found in early and late childhood in both developed and developing countries, in adults, changes in environment and [[social status]] reduce the strength of this correlation.&lt;ref name="Teasdale1989"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Teasdale T. W. |author2=Srensen T. I. A. |author3=Owen D. R. | year = 1989 | title = Fall in association of height with intelligence and educational level | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 298 | issue = 6683| pages = 1292–1293 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.298.6683.1292 | pmid = 2500201 | pmc = 1836522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent findings suggest that height discrimination occurs most often against racial minorities. A 2007 study found that African-Americans reported higher weight and height related discrimination. This discrimination was even higher in female employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roehling|first=Mark V.|last2=Roehling|first2=Patricia V.|last3=Pichler|first3=Shaun|date=2007-10-01|title=The relationship between body weight and perceived weight-related employment discrimination: The role of sex and race|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879107000437|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=71|issue=2|pages=300–318|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2007.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, attourney and author lawyer Tanya Osensky published ''[https://www.amazon.com/Shortchanged-Height-Discrimination-Strategies-Social/dp/1512601438 Shortchanged: Height Discrimination and Strategies for Social Change]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1512601438/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_NztSBbASX6R6P|title=Shortchanged: Height Discrimination and Strategies for Social Change|last=results|first=search|date=2017-10-03|publisher=ForeEdge|isbn=9781512601435|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book exposes the cultural, medical, and occupational issues that short people face, which are often deemed unimportant and disregarded. Osensky challenges heightism by disclosing some beneficial aspects of shortness and suggesting avenues of activism and change.

===In business===
Some jobs do require or at least favor tall people, including some [[manual labor]] jobs, law enforcement, most [[professional sports]], flight attendants, and fashion modeling. US Military pilots have to be 63 to 79 inches (160 to 200&amp;nbsp;cm) tall with a sitting height of {{convert|34|to|40|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name="AFROTC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrotc.com/admissions/medicalReq.php|title=U.S. Air Force ROTC despite statistical and physical evidence to support the proposition that short people consistently have reduced reaction times.: Admissions requirements|website=afrotc.com|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008211834/http://www.afrotc.com/admissions/medicalReq.php|archivedate=8 October 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These exceptions noted, in the great majority of cases a person’s height would not seem to have an effect on how well they are able to perform their job. Nevertheless, studies have shown that short people are paid less than taller people, with disparities similar in magnitude to the race and gender gaps.&lt;ref name="Why tall people make more money"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/Careers/02/02/cb.tall.people/index.html|title=Why tall people make more money - CNN.com|first=By Meg Donohue |last=CareerBuilder.com|website=www.cnn.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys have uncovered that less than 3% of [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] were below {{height|ft=5|in=7}} in height. 90% of CEOs are of above average height.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Rauch"&gt;[http://www.jonathanrauch.com/jrauch_articles/height_discrimination_short_guys_finish_last/index.html "Short Guys Finish Last" The world's most enduring form of discrimination. The Economist, 23 December 1995].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, market researcher Seth Ulinski published ''[http://a.co/d/e7JshIA Amazing Heights: How Short Men Stand Tall]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQPLMPR/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_KytSBbADZ5V9Y|title=Amazing Heights: How Short Men Stand Tall|last=Ulinski|first=Seth|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book highlights that through technology and an entrepreneurial mindset, members of the "short guy fraternity" are able to blaze their own paths - bypassing potential glass ceilings and pay gaps. For example, short guy fraternity members include: Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos (5'7&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;), Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg (5'7&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and Google co-founder and Alphabet President Sergey Brin (5'8&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;). With an estimated net worth of over $150 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-net-worth-life-spending-2018-8|title=Jeff Bezos is the richest person alive — here's how he makes and spends his billions|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bezos is ranked as the richest person in the world, while Zuckerberg and Brin consistently rank in the top 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-people-world-billionaires-list-2017-11|title=These are the 50 richest people in the world right now|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating and marriage===
Heightism is also a factor in dating preferences. For some people, height is a [[Physical attractiveness#Height|noteworthy factor in sexual attractiveness]].

The greater reproductive success of taller men is attested to by studies indicating that taller men are more likely to be married and to have more children, except in societies with severe sex imbalances caused by war.&lt;ref name="DontWant"&gt;[http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/Research/HumanNatureProgArticles/dontwantnoshortshortmanFI.html Miami University of Ohio: “Don’t Want No Short, Short Man: The Study Of Height, Power, and Mate Selection”].&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent research has drawn this theory into question, finding no correlation between height and offspring count.&lt;ref name="correlate"&gt;[http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP06369385.pdf "Physique Correlates with Reproductive Success in an Archival Sample of Delinquent Youth"].&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, research on leg length and [[Physical attractiveness#Leg-to-body ratio|leg-to-body ratio]] conflicts with the notion that there is a distinct preference for taller mates. A 2008 study found that both extremes, tall and short, reduced attractiveness, and a 2006 study found that a lower leg-to-body ratio in men and higher leg-to-body ratio in women increased aesthetic appeal.&lt;ref name="legLength"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Ez5uazVNELMJ:commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Sorokowski-Adaptive-preferences-for-leg-length-in-a-potential-partner.pdf+height+and+occupational+success+evolutionary&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg6EYN1yttQPQbBwLLz8tPj-mBx6kZUVyHs6o1vPeHRQKqxaJyQI7mlfiw1SQ-gMO1OLj_DI5ldyCJCriyl2qef_gWiJm6OWjaO4s-gCR15YYTbHaigK5jHbzvAHGoqD474ceF-&amp;sig=AHIEtbSIDsqspZnNj5-F3bF5sqoWVnVeTQ&amp;pli=1: "Adaptive Preferences for Leg Length in a Potential Partner"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aAppeal"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Ez5uazVNELMJ:commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Sorokowski-Adaptive-preferences-for-leg-length-in-a-potential-partner.pdf+height+and+occupational+success+evolutionary&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg6EYN1yttQPQbBwLLz8tPj-mBx6kZUVyHs6o1vPeHRQKqxaJyQI7mlfiw1SQ-gMO1OLj_DI5ldyCJCriyl2qef_gWiJm6OWjaO4s-gCR15YYTbHaigK5jHbzvAHGoqD474ceF-&amp;sig=AHIEtbSIDsqspZnNj5-F3bF5sqoWVnVeTQ&amp;pli=1: "The leg-to-body ratio as a human aesthetic criterion"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologically, from an evolutionary perspective, these findings are consistent with data relating [[Human height#Height and (physiological and psychological) health|height to human health]]. Therefore, a biological or, more specifically, an evolutionary argument for the preference of a taller mate is questionable, lacking definitive evidence. Nonetheless, research by [[Dan Ariely]] found that American women exhibit a marked preference for dating taller men, and that for shorter men to be judged attractive by women, they must earn substantially more money than taller men.&lt;ref&gt;"Ariely found that a 5'4" man would need to make $229,000 more than a 6' man to have equal appeal; a 5'6" man would need $183,000 more; a 5'10" man would need $32,000 more." [[Lori Gottlieb]] (2010). ''Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough''. Penguin, {{ISBN|9781101185209}} p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study found that both men and women are willing to excuse height differences by using a trade-off approach. Men may compensate 1.3 BMI units with a 1 percent higher wage than their wife. Women may compensate 2 BMI units with an additional year of higher education.&lt;ref name="Sohn 110–124"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sohn|first=Kitae|date=2015-07-01|title=The value of male height in the marriage market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X15000398|journal=Economics &amp; Human Biology|volume=18|pages=110–124|doi=10.1016/j.ehb.2015.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a 2015 study found that both men and women receive benefits for having a tall spouse. The husband's gains include beauty that results from his wife's positive attributes that are correlated with her height such as education. The wife on the other hand looks for a tall husband due to them generating higher earnings.&lt;ref name="Sohn 110–124"/&gt;

Nonetheless, on a cultural level in [[Post-industrial society]], a sociological relationship between height and perceived attractiveness exists. This cultural characteristic, while applicable to the modernized world, is not a transcendental human quality.&lt;ref name="hadza"&gt;[http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/24375/1/How_universal_are_human_mate_choices_%28LSERO%29.pdf: "How universal are human mate choices? Size doesn’t matter when Hadza foragers are choosing a mate"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Quantitative studies of woman-for-men [[personal advertisement]]s have shown strong preference for tall men, with a large percentage indicating that a man significantly below average height was unacceptable.&lt;ref name="ShortSupport3"&gt;[http://www.shortsupport.org/Research/personals.html Short Persons Support: “Personals Analyzer”].&lt;/ref&gt; A study produced by the Universities of Groningen and Valencia, has found that men who felt most anxious about attractive, physically dominant, and socially powerful rivals, were less jealous, the taller they were themselves.&lt;ref name="Nature.com"&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2008/03/short_men_are_the_jealous_type.html Short men are the jealous type - March 13, 2008"].&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that women were most jealous of others' [[physical attractiveness]], but women of medium height were the least jealous.&lt;ref name="The New Scientist"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726475.200-your-height-dictates-how-jealousy-strikes.html Your height dictates how jealousy strikes"].&lt;/ref&gt; The report, produced by Dutch and Spanish researchers, stated that because average height women tend to be the most fertile and healthy, they would be less likely to feel threatened by women with those similar features.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7291366.stm Short men 'are the most jealous'"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the media===
In the [[Mass media|media]], heightism can take the form of making fun of people whose height is out of the normal range in ways that would be unseemly if directed at [[skin color]] or [[weight]]. An example is [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]]'s portrayal of Eric "E" Murphy in [[HBO]]'s television series [[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]] (Connolly is {{convert|5|ft|5|in|abbr=on|disp=or}})&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175305/bio Kevin Connolly (I) - Biography&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, shorter men are often denied leading roles. Although some famous cinema actors such as [[Alan Ladd]] {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m|abbr=on}} have been short in real life, in their fictional depictions they have been presented as taller. There have also been cases of very tall actors encountering problems in Hollywood. [[Dolph Lundgren]] and [[Armie Hammer]], both standing about {{convert|6|ft|4+1/2|in|m|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, stated that they had lost jobs or were about to do so because of being too tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebheights.com/s/Dolph-Lundgren-22.html|title=Dolph Lundgren Height - How tall|website=www.celebheights.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebheights.com/s/Armie-Hammer-47501.html|title=Armie Hammer Height|website=www.celebheights.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 the [[BBC]] comedy series ''[[A Small Problem]]'' imagined a totalitarian society in which people under the height of {{convert|5|ft}} were systematically discriminated against. The program attracted considerable criticism and complaints which accused the writers of reinforcing prejudice and of using offensive terms; the writers responded that their intention had been to show all prejudice was stupid and that height was chosen randomly.&lt;ref name="BBC Comedy guide"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/smallproblema_1299002875.shtml A Small Problem] in BBC Comedy Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[S&amp;M Short and Male]], a documentary aired in 2008, demonstrated the obstacles and bigotry that short statured men face every day in life, love and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Reviews/S/S_M_Short_And_Male/2008/05/16/5585311-sun.html |title=CANOE - JAM!

==Legislation==
Currently, there is one state in the United States of America, [[Michigan]], that prohibits height discrimination.&lt;ref name="Michigah"&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/documents/act_453_elliott_larsen_8772_7.pdf Text] of the Elliot Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; There is pending legislation introduced by [[Massachusetts]] Representative [[Byron Rushing]] which would add Massachusetts to the list.&lt;ref name="Massachusetts"&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/house/ht03pdf/ht03752.pdf Text (PDF)] of Massachusetts House bill 3752, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Two municipalities currently prohibit height discrimination: [[Santa Cruz, California]]&lt;ref name="Advocates"&gt;[http://www.genderadvocates.org/policy/Ordinances/Laws/Santa%20Cruz%20Ordinance.htm Chapter 9.83] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105201654/http://www.genderadvocates.org/policy/Ordinances/Laws/Santa%20Cruz%20Ordinance.htm |date=2006-11-05 }} of the City of Santa Cruz code – "Prohibition against Discrimination", 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="NAAFA"&gt;[http://www.naafa.org/fatf/sf_height_weight.html Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114214707/http://www.naafa.org/fatf/sf_height_weight.html |date=2006-11-14 }} of Compliance Guidelines To Prohibit Weight and Height Discrimination; San Francisco Administrative Code Chapters 12A, 12B and 12C and San Francisco Municipal/Police Code Article 33, 26 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[District of Columbia]] prohibits discrimination based on personal appearance.&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;[http://ohr.dc.gov/ohr/cwp/view,a,3,q,491858,ohrNav,%7C30953%7C.asp Text] District of Columbia Human Rights Act.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ontario]], Canada prohibits height discrimination under the human rights code.&lt;ref name="Ontario"&gt;[http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/resources/Policies/PolicyHtWt/view Policy on height and weight requirements] Ontario, Canada Human Rights Code.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria, Australia]] prohibits discrimination based on physical features under the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995.&lt;ref name="Victoria"&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/eoa1995250/index.html Text] Victoria, Australia Equal Opportunity Act of 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of successful legal battles pursued against height discrimination in the workplace include a 2002 case involving highly qualified applicants being turned down for jobs at a bank because they were considered too short;&lt;ref name="Chinese"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/05/31/dorf.height.discrimination/index.html Chinese Height Discrimination Case].&lt;/ref&gt; a 2005 Swedish case involving an unfair height requirement for employment implemented by [[Volvo]] car company;&lt;ref name="Volvo"&gt;[https://archive.is/20120918124449/http://www.eiro.eurofound.eu.int/2005/11/inbrief/se0511102n.html Volvo Car Company Height requirement for employment].&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1999 case involving a [[Kohler Company]] informal practice not to consider women who applied for jobs unless they were at least {{convert|5|ft|4|in|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref name="Kohler"&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/esa/archive/esa99268.htm Kohler Corp. Gender Discrimination Case].&lt;/ref&gt; Height requirements for employment which are not a [[Bona fide occupational requirement|''bona fide'' occupational requirement]] are becoming less common.

==Height and suicide in men==
A research report published in the [[American Journal of Psychiatry]] found a strong inverse association between height and suicide in Swedish men which may signify the importance of childhood exposure in the [[etiology]] of adult mental disorder or reflect stigmatization or discrimination encountered by short men in their adult lives. A record linkage study of the birth, conscription, mortality, family, and census register data of 1,299,177 Swedish men followed from age 18 to a maximum of age 49 was performed and it was found that a 5-cm (2-inch) increase in height was associated with a 9% decrease in suicide risk.&lt;ref name=" Patrik K.E. Magnusson et al. "&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1373 " Strong Inverse Association Between Height and Suicide in a Large Cohort of Swedish Men: Evidence of Early Life Origins of Suicidal Behavior?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9731">An '''insert card''' is a card that is randomly inserted into packs of a sports card offering. These insert cards are not part of the regular numbering system of a set of sports cards and they tend to have a unique design.&lt;ref&gt;http://sportscards.about.com/od/sportscardglossary/g/insert_card.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Another term for insert cards is chase cards. Insert cards either have their own numbering system (although some insert cards may have no number). Insert cards are found less frequently than base cards. Autographed cards, memorabilia cards and parallel cards are also classified as insert cards. Insert cards are randomly inserted into packs at a specific ratio. A 1:24 ratio specifies that on average one of every 24 packs will contain a card from that insert set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondfans.com/howto-collect.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728194407/http://www.diamondfans.com/howto-collect.html |archivedate=2012-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of inserts==
Non-rare to rare cards that are randomly inserted into packs can be inserted in various ratios like 1 per 24 packs. Not only is an Insert Card often different from the main set, but its numbering tends to be different (examples: numbers on the back can be SP1 or SP2). Issuing these cards would not be possible without the approval of both Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efqreview.com/NewFiles/possessions.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*A parallel card is a sports card that is identical to a base card in the same sports card offering. The difference is attributed to a visual element. These elements can include foil stamping, a different design, autographs or memorabilia swatches that the base card did not have. Such cards usually have smaller print runs than the original and can lead to the parallel card being worth more than the base card.&lt;ref&gt;http://sportscards.about.com/od/sportscardglossary/g/parallel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*A memorabilia card is an insert card that contains a piece of equipment used by an athlete in an athletic competition, such as part of a bat, jersey or cap. These inserts are often highly prized by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondfans.com/howto-collect.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728194407/http://www.diamondfans.com/howto-collect.html |archivedate=2012-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An autograph card is an insert card that is autographed by the player.
*Serially numbered cards: Insert cards, memorabilia cards and parallel cards may be serially numbered. The rationale is that each card is numbered sequentially. The serial number of the card is stamped onto the card itself. A card may be numbered 1 of 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondfans.com/howto-collect.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728194407/http://www.diamondfans.com/howto-collect.html |archivedate=2012-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable inserts==
*In 1998, the Upper Deck Card Company purchased a Babe Ruth bat at auction for $23,000 (used by Ruth sometime during the period 1923–31). Upper Deck sliced the bat into approximately 550 tiny pieces that could be affixed to limited edition collector’s cards. These cards were randomly inserted into packs of various 1999 Upper Deck card product lines released in late 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efqreview.com/NewFiles/possessions.html&lt;/ref&gt;

These cards were part of Upper Deck’s "Pieces of History" promotion. Upper Deck extended the concept to bats of all of the members of baseball’s 500 Home Run Club.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efqreview.com/NewFiles/possessions.html&lt;/ref&gt; The set included the 19 members of the elite 500 Home Run Club. Each card had a piece of game used bat on the card and although not serial numbered, each was limited to a print run of 350. This was the true first Game Used Bat set to be created as Upper Deck had already experimented with game used jersey material cards two years earlier in 1997.

There were autographed versions of a few key players. By far the hardest card to find was the Babe Ruth Card. There were two separate Babe Ruth issues, the Piece of History card (Run of 350) and the Piece of History 500 (print run of only 50). These cards were scattered across various Upper Deck 1999 brands and into some year 2000 products. Upper Deck also issued cards of other members that have joined the club over the years. These have included cards of Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Ken Griffey, Jr., Rafael Palmiero, Frank Thomas and Jim Thome.&lt;ref&gt;http://mybaseballcardsonline.com/upper-deck/ud-poh-500/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yankee Stadium legacy===
The Yankee Stadium Legacy set is a 6,500-card compilation chronicling every single game ever played at Yankee Stadium. The card set was manufactured by [[Upper Deck]] and made its official debut by being inserted in random packs of Upper Deck's 2008 Series 1 Baseball.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.upperdeck.com/news/article.aspx?aid=3776&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cards in the set commemorate some of the most famous sporting events that have taken place at Yankee Stadium. Some of these events include: Lou Gehrig's "Luckiest Man Alive" Speech (July 4, 1939); Babe Ruth's "Final Visit to Yankee Stadium" (June 11, 1948); Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling heavyweight title bout (June 19, 1936, Schmeling won), the 1958 NFL Championship between the New York Giants and the Baltimore Colts and Muhammad Ali's title defense against Ken Norton (Sept. 28, 1976).

The Guinness World Book of Records will certify The Yankee Stadium Legacy as the largest baseball card set ever produced, once all the cards are released.&lt;ref&gt;http://sportscards.about.com/b/2008/01/19/yankee-stadium-legacy-set-aims-to-be-largest-baseball-card-set-ever.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The official recognition will take place only after all of the 6,500 cards are released in Upper Deck's various baseball card launches throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.upperdeck.com/news/article.aspx?aid=3776&lt;/ref&gt;

The various sets where the Yankee Stadium Legacy cards were inserted into were: Spectrum; Piece of History; SPx; Upper Deck Series Two; SP Legendary Cuts (Hobby-only); SP Authentic; UDx; and UD Masterpieces. Upper Deck started a website so that collectors could find out more about the Yankee Stadium Legacy set.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.upperdeck.com/baseball/yankeestadium&lt;/ref&gt; Alphanumeric codes found on the backs of Yankee Stadium Legacy cards can be entered at the site, and collectors will can use the site to manage their collections online, and track their collections against other collectors via a leader board.

Tommy Baxter, a 36-year-old from Little Rock, Arkansas, was the first collector to put together Upper Deck’s Yankee Stadium Legacy (YSL) Collection. Baxter was an avid Cubs fan, and seized the opportunity to become the first collector to piece together the insert set.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/latest-sports-collecting-news/6-000-card-yankee-stadium-legacy-set-complete.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th anniversary program===
In observance of the 20th anniversary in 2009, Upper Deck released a set that can be found in all of the company’s 2009 baseball trading card releases. The massive 2,500 card set commemorated the last twenty years in sports, pop culture, politics, world history and technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.upperdeck.com/basketball/article.aspx?aid=5183&lt;/ref&gt; The first cards from the 20th Anniversary Retrospective set were found in 2009 Upper Deck Series One Baseball. An additional element to the set was the 100-card memorabilia set, that was found in all sets beginning with 2009 Upper Deck Spectrum Baseball, (released on February 24).

===Michael Jordan legacy===
In April 2009, the company announcement that longtime company spokesman [[Michael Jordan]] would be honored with an 1,170-card tribute insert set chronicling every single Chicago Bulls game Jordan played in. The set will begin with his NBA debut on October 26, 1984, through his final Bulls appearance in Game 6 of the NBA Finals on June 14, 1998. 
The 1,170-card set will pack out across four 2009 Upper Deck basketball products: Lineage (April 1); Radiance (April 29); Upper Deck (Sept. 22); and First Edition (Sept. 29). Each of the cards will include MJ’s specific box score stats from the game in question. The set will be given every card some historical significance as the overall set captures every game Jordan ever played with the Bulls, regular-season and playoff battles included. The cards will fall, on average, 1:4 packs across all four brands.

In addition to the 1,170 Jordan game cards, Upper Deck also included 100 different game-used memorabilia cards, each one crash-numbered to 23. The cards will sport swatches from Michael’s game-worn jerseys. More than 100 different action photos showing Michael through the years were used for card front photography.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upperdeck.com/marketing/news_article.aspx?aid=5577&lt;/ref&gt;

===Champs Hockey===
[[Upper Deck]]'s Champs Hockey release from 2008-09 featured insert cards with bone fragments from creatures like the Woolly Mammoth and Woolly Rhinoceros. Articles such as a woolly mammoth femur, Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth, and Triceratops vertebrae were other items found in the bone fragments cards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/latest-sports-collecting-news/upper-deck-champs-hockey-ice-meets-ice-age.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1889">The '''Kent Archaeological Society''' was founded in 1857 to promote the study and publication of [[archaeology]] and [[history]], especially that pertaining to the ancient county of [[Kent]] in [[England]]. This includes the modern administrative county as well as areas now subsumed by south east [[London]] and in the district of [[Medway]].

It carries out [[archaeological survey]]s and [[excavations]] funded through membership subscriptions as well as being involved in the protection and recording of historic buildings and churches. In addition, it organises lectures, excursions and other education projects and can make grants or loans of equipment to archaeological projects. A library in the museum at [[Maidstone]] is available for members' use and a field school is often run in the summer.

It publishes an annual journal, ''Archaeologia Cantiana'', and a quarterly newsletter. Through its Record Series, it publishes editions of [[archive|archival texts]] relating to the county, and it therefore functions as the [[Text publication society|record society]] for Kent. It also publishes other occasional volumes on specific topics.

Recent projects include assisting in the excavation of the [[Ringlemere barrow]] and a translation and record of the [[Kent Hundred Rolls]]. A number of local societies are affiliated to it and it has links with national and county archaeological organisations.

[[File:John Vanbrugh.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[John Vanbrugh|Sir John Vanbrugh]] in [[Godfrey Kneller]]'s Kit-cat portrait, considered one of Kneller's finest portraits.]]A '''kit-cat portrait''' or '''kit-kat portrait''' is a particular size of portrait, less than half-length, but including the hands. The name originates from a famous series of portraits which were commissioned from [[Godfrey Kneller]] for members of the [[Kit-Cat Club]], a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] dining club, to be hung in their meeting place at [[Barn Elms]]. They are now mostly in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]], with a selection of about twelve displayed in London and others at their satellite locations, including twenty on display at [[Beningbrough Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfund.org/supporting-museums/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/1531/portraits-of-members-of-the-kit-kat-club&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size==
Each canvas is thirty-six inches long, and twenty-eight wide.&lt;ref&gt;Malone wrote in Dryden 534 (1800)&lt;/ref&gt; The special Kit-cat portrait size is said to have been determined because the dining-room ceiling of the Kit-cat Club was too low for half-length portraits of the members. Slightly larger than the traditional head and shoulders format, it allows enough space to include one or both hands. So, while the poses in the Kit-cat portraits may look similar, none is actually repeated. When hung together, the overall effect is of a unified club of equals, though each man retains his individuality through distinct gestures, props and costumes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/display/room-by-room/room-9-the-kit-cat-club.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The Kit Kat portraits, as a whole, can be broken down into three separate types. The first group may be represented by the portrait of [[John Vanbrugh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw06470/Sir-John-Vanbrugh?set=347%3BThe+Kit-cat+Club+portraits%3A+by+Sir+Godfrey+Kneller&amp;displayNo=60&amp;search=ap&amp;rNo=10&lt;/ref&gt; Vanbrugh's portrait is the most famous and the style of the painting is the most common.

Subjects wear huge stately wigs and formal clothing. The men painted in this style often look down and off to the left of the view, if to be day-dreaming or thinking of some grand political scheme. These men are also painted with a ring or pendant, depicting their [[family crest]].

[[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire|William Cavendish]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw01823/William-Cavendish-2nd-Duke-of-Devonshire?set=347%3BThe+Kit-cat+Club+portraits%3A+by+Sir+Godfrey+Kneller&amp;displayNo=60&amp;search=ap&amp;rNo=27&lt;/ref&gt; represents the second most popular pose in the series. He is painted with the same stately wig and fine clothing but he holds his staff of office as [[Lord Steward]]. His face is also more ruddy than Vanbrugh's, suggesting that he may be younger.

Thomas Hopkins represents the third most popular style. Instead of a wig, Hopkins is bald and sports a red cap but his clothes are the same as his fellow Kit Kats. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw03243/Thomas-Hopkins?set=347%3BThe+Kit-cat+Club+portraits%3A+by+Sir+Godfrey+Kneller&amp;displayNo=60&amp;search=ap&amp;rNo=38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kloran of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Kanada, based in Toronto.jpg|thumb|Kloran of the Ku Klux Klan of Kanada]]
The '''Kloran'''  (a [[portmanteau]] of "Klan" and "[[Quran|Koran]]")&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of jargon
 by Jonathon Green, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P0QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA317&amp;lpg=PA317&amp;dq=kloran+koran+name&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RGXNL92iYH&amp;sig=YNEa5qoUQRQobOnOERsaaJ8-JZU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5va1SbK3MpmMsQOdzPTwCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result page 317 - "Kloran" entry]&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[handbook]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].  Versions of the Kloran typically contain detailed descriptions of the role of different Klan members as well as detailing Klan ceremonies and procedures.

The letters ''Kl'' were often used at the beginning of words to delineate a Klan association.  Examples include: Kloran, Klonversation (conversation), Klavern (cavern or tavern; local branch or meeting place), Klavaliers, etc.  This differed from the practice of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] Ku Klux Klan; very little of the Reconstruction Klan's terminology was carried over, and that mostly titles for high officials in the organization.  The leader of an individual Klavern, for example, was an "Exalted Cyclops."

The original Kloran was written by [[William Joseph Simmons|William J. Simmons]], for his revived "Knights of the Ku Klux Klan," c. 1915.  He drew heavily on his previous experiences as a "fraternalist;" he was a member of many different lodges and had sold memberships in the [[Woodmen of the World]] before deciding to revive the Klan.

[[File:Genie-fmurr-panel1.png|right]]
'''''Le Génie des alpages''''' is a French humoristic [[comic book]] series by [[F'Murr]]. The series first appeared in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine on January 11, 1973.&lt;ref name="BDO-1973"&gt;{{Cite web|last=BDoubliées|title=Pilote année 1973|url=http://www.bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/annees/1973.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 [[Dargaud|Les Éditions Dargaud]] started publication of hardcover albums.

==Synopsis==
The short stories are usually told in one-page segments, and unpredictably follow the lives of the series' cast. This includes the old nameless shepherd, his successor, the young Athanase Percevalve, the Dog Without a Name (an intellectual talking shepherd's dog), and a flock of eccentric, verbal sheep, led by Romuald the black ram. Other unorthodox characters appear, such as the Berthold the stupid St.Bernhard, Kattarsis the petite self-conscious sphinx, a lion, a fox, eagles, snakes, and "Death" in the shape of an attractive woman. Some of these recur frequently.

There is usually no apparent [[plot (narrative)|plot]] in any of these stories from the Swiss [[Alps]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/fmurr.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they often consist of different [[dialogue]]s and simultaneous happenings, making the overall impression of a totally [[surreal humour|absurd]] and secluded world. Nevertheless, F'murr always manages to maintain a kind of direction and realism in his otherwise pointless universe, and somewhere in between is the humour that his fans find hilarious but inexplicable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1930">The '''Polignac Memorandum''' was a document by [[George Canning]] (British Foreign Secretary) written in October 1823, stating that Great Britain had no intention of aiding Spain in the retention of her colonies in Latin and South America.  The document was a result of talks with Prince [[Jules de Polignac]], the French Ambassador to Great Britain.  Both countries (France and Great Britain) agreed that there was no hope of Spain recovering her colonies in the Americas, that neither nation had any desire to gain territory in the region, or gain exclusive commercial treaties.  Canning was then able to advise [[King George IV]] to extend diplomatic recognition to Buenos Aires, Colombia, and Mexico, and authorize British ministers in South America to negotiate with their respective states for commercial treaties.

During this time period, the European states had formed the Quintuple Alliance after the 1815 Congress of Vienna to restore balance to Europe after the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  Spain was  having trouble with its colonies in Latin and South America, and was fighting a losing battle to remain an empire.  [[Villele]], the French Prime Minister under [[Louis XVIII]] viewed the Polignac Memorandum as a way to refuse to aid [[Ferdinand VII]] in his attempts to regain his colonies.

The '''reference desk''' or '''information desk''' of a library is a public service counter where professional [[librarian]]s provide library users with direction to library materials, advice on library collections and services, and expertise on multiple kinds of information from multiple sources.

==Purpose and usage==
Library users can consult the staff at the reference desk for help in finding information.  Using a structured [[reference interview]], the librarian works with the library user to clarify their needs and determine what information sources will fill them.&lt;ref name="reference desk"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miles|first1=Dennis B.|title=Shall We Get Rid Of The Reference Desk?|journal=Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly|date=2013|volume=52|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BLS Librarians"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crosby|first1=Olivia|title=Librarians: Information Experts in the Information Age|url=http://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2000/Winter/art01.pdf|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To borrow a medical analogy, reference librarians diagnose and treat information deficiencies.

The ultimate help provided may consist of reading material in the form of a [[book]] or [[Academic journal|journal]] article, instruction in the use of specific searchable information resources such as the library's online [[library catalog|catalog]] or subscription [[bibliographic database|bibliographic/fulltext database]]s, or simply factual information drawn from the library's print or online [[reference work|reference collection]].  Information is also provided to patrons through electronic resources.&lt;ref name="BLS Librarians" /&gt; Typically, a reference desk can be consulted either in person, by telephone, through email or online chat, although a library user may be asked to come to the library in person for help with more involved research questions.  A staffed and knowledgeable reference desk is an essential part of a library.

The services that are provided at a reference desk may vary depending on the type of library, its purpose, its resources, and its staff.

==History==
Reference services did not become commonplace in libraries until the late 1800s. These services initially began in public libraries.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=Liya|title=The Evolution of Library Reference Services: From General to Special, 1876-1920's|journal=Libri: International Journal of Libraries &amp; Information Services|date=September 2014|volume=64|issue=3|pages=254–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first librarians were hesitant to offer reference services because many libraries did not have a large enough staff to provide the services without other duties being neglected.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference" /&gt; Beginning in 1883 with the [[Boston Public Library]], libraries began to hire librarians whose primary duty was to provide reference services.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference" /&gt;

One of the earliest proponents of references services was [[Samuel Swett Green]]. He wrote an article titled "Personal Relations Between Librarians and Readers" which had a large impact on the future of reference services.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference" /&gt;
then, it operated to incorporate ... making the following variables relevant in offering reference services: the user's query; the reference librarian; and, the reference sources. Until hitherto the communication between the reference librarian and the user are through direct contact. Hence, Utor (2008), defined reference services as a direct personal assistance to readers seeking information. That is during the traditional era. towards the later decades of 19th century, however, reference and information services witnessed an insidious yet drastic paradigm-shift following the incorporation of information communication technology in reference services (and in library operations, by extension). Thus leading to an entirely new era, otherwise known as digital era with different information technologies coming in to aid the work of a reference librarian; changing information sources, reference processes and communication medium.

==Resources==
Resources that are often kept at a library reference desk may include:
* A computer with internet access. Librarians use both the public web and subscription databases to find and evaluate information and research sources. 
* A small collection of [[reference work|reference book]]s (called ''ready reference'') that are most often used, so that the librarians can reach them quickly, especially when they are on the phone, and so that the books will be returned in time for someone else to use later the same day. The library's full reference collection is usually nearby as well.
* Newspaper clipping files and other rare or restricted items that must be returned to the reference desk.
* Index cards with the answers to frequently asked questions, and/or drawers with folders of pamphlets and photocopies of pages that, from previous experience, were difficult to find.  These enable librarians to find such information quickly without leaving the desk—even faster than they could look it up in a reference book or using the Internet.
* Books and other items that are being held for library users who asked the librarian by phone to set them aside for them to pick up later the same day, or within the next few days.
* Books from the circulating collection that have been set aside for students working on a special assignment, and are temporarily designated to be used only within the library until the project is due.
* Printed lists of items in the library that are not in the catalogue, such as newspapers, school yearbooks, old telephone directories, college course catalogues, and local history sources.

==Services==
Services that are often available at a library reference desk include:
* A sign up sheet for reserving computers with Internet access, or [[Word processor|word processing]] software.
* The ability to place the book 'on hold', which prevents the person who has borrowed it from renewing it.  The person who placed the 'hold' is notified when the book has been returned. (Some libraries provide this service at the [[Library circulation|circulation]] desk.)
* The ability to request [[interlibrary loan]] of books and other material from other branch libraries in the same library system, or from a cooperating library anywhere in the world. (Some libraries provide this service at the circulation desk.)
* The opportunity to recommend that the library purchase something for its collection that it doesn't have, which may be needed or of interest to other library users.

The [[librarian]] who staffs the reference desk can usually do the following by virtue of their professional training and experience:
* The librarian can look up a brief, factual answer to a specific question.
* The librarian can use the catalogue to find out whether the library owns an item with a particular title or author, or that contains a short story, chapter, song, or poem with a particular title, or to compile a list of books by a particular author or on a particular subject.
* The librarian can briefly teach the user how to use the catalogue and how to use its advanced features, or recommend the proper subject words or terms that are used in the catalogue for the topic the user has in mind.
* The librarian can often take the library user directly to the shelves with books on a certain topic without using the catalogue.
* The librarian is familiar with the contents of hundreds of [[reference work|reference book]]s, and can recommend books that might contain the answer to a particular question.
* The librarian can teach the library user to use online [[database]]s such as [[magazine]] and [[newspaper]] articles, and recommend words and search strategies for the topic the user has in mind.
* The librarian can recommend reliable [[Website|web sites]], give advice on searching the Internet for information, and evaluate the reliability of the information on web sites.
* If the library doesn't have information on a given topic, or if the library user wants more information, the librarian can refer the library user to another library or to an organization that can be contacted by phone or mail.
*Offer aid with devices such as tablets and e-readers.  This can range from general assistance with questions on how to navigate e-reader and tablet devices to instructing classes.  Questions can vary from what devices are compatible with the library's e-book platform, how to check out books, and how to read electronic books.

==Staff qualifications==
In the [[United States]], those who staff library reference desks are usually required to have a master's degree in library science&lt;ref name="BLS Librarians" /&gt; from a program accredited by the [[American Library Association]].&lt;ref name="librarian education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Librarians: How to Become a Librarian|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/librarians.htm#tab-4|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if there is a lack of qualified applicants, particularly in rural areas, a person with an associate degree, a certificate in library technology, or a bachelor's degree in library science may perform these duties. In many academic libraries, student assistants are used as the primary contact, sometimes at an "information desk."

In [[Sri Lanka]], librarians at reference desks typically have master's degrees from the Sri Lankan Library Association's accredited programs.

==Electronic reference services==
With the development of the Web, [[Digital Reference Services|digital reference services]] are beginning to take over some of the roles of the traditional reference desk in a library. There is disagreement over whether or not this development is desirable or inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i33/33a03701.htm  Are Reference Desks Dying Out?] by Scott Carlson, ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' April 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russian National Unity''' ('''RNU''') or '''All-Russian civic patriotic movement "Russian National Unity"''' ({{lang-ru|Всероссийское общественное патриотическое движение "Русское Национальное Единство"}}), is a [[Neo-Nazi]] [[political party]] and [[paramilitary]] organization based in [[Russia]] and formerly operating in states with Russian-speaking populations.&lt;ref name=gunnar&gt;{{cite journal|last = Simonsen|first = Sven Gunnar|date=December 1996|title =Aleksandr Barkashov and Russian National Unity: Blackshirt friends of the nation|journal = [[Nationalities Papers]]|volume=24|issue=4|pages=625–639|doi=10.1080/00905999608408473}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by the ultra-nationalist [[Alexander Barkashov]].&lt;ref name=gunnar/&gt; The movement advocates the expulsion of non-Russians and an increased role for traditional Russian institutions such as the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

The organization is currently unregistered federally in Russia.

==Ideology and tactics==
Promoting the notion of "[[Russia for Russians]] and compatriots", members of the party (sometimes called "Barkashovites") endorse policies including the expulsion of minorities that "have their homeland outside Russia," especially [[Jew]]s and migrants from the [[South Caucasus]], such as [[Azeri]], [[Georgians]] and [[Armenians]], as well as other countries. Their vision of Russia is divided into privileged ethnic Russians and "compatriots" - non-Russians who live in Russia and have their national homeland there, including indigenous populations of [[Russian Far East]], [[Extreme North (Russia)|North]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], and some other minorities. While they consider these "compatriots" to be entitled to live in Russia, the RNU nonetheless condemns any inter-ethnic and inter-racial marriages, claiming that "they create psychological troubles of self-identification for children from such marriages".{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}
{{Nazism sidebar}}
According to the ''Saint Petersburg Times'', new recruits (''storonniki'', literally: "supporters", "siders") to the organization have traditionally been required to serve as low-level functionaries in the organization, acting as drivers and handing out flyers, as well as attending instructional sessions on the group's philosophy and beliefs, many of which are derived from a book written by Barkashov. As members advance, they may attain the rank of ''spodvizhniki'' (literally: archaic, high-style for "co-workers"; "co-endeavourers")  and are entitled to wear the insignia and participate in paramilitary training. The most dedicated members advance to the ranks of the ''soratniki'' (literally: "comrades-in-arms"), who serve as the leadership of the group.

The organisation also worked with businesses, state officials, military and secret services. Supporting businessmen were awarded certificates of merit and other honours. The organization presently avoids direct violations of the law. Some officials have allowed RNU to take part in street patrols and other collaborations with the police; and military training facilities have been made available. Some sympathetic state and industrial officials lent RNU places for meetings, provided facilities to print literature, make uniforms, and copy CDs and video cassettes and other materials. Several martial arts classes with RNU instructors associated with state schools were opened.

==History==
In 1989, Barkashov was the second in command in Russian National-Patriotic Front [[Pamyat]]. His conflict with [[Dmitri Dmitriyevich Vasilyev|Dmitri Vasilyev]] resulted in Barkashov leading, in his words, "the most disciplined and active members, dissatisfied with empty talk and theatrical stunts, out of Pamyat." In 1990, RNU grew in the face of the economic and social difficulties faced by Russians in the course of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

The  Russian National Unity movement was founded on 16 October 1990 by a splinter group of the National Patriotic Front "Memory" (NPF "Pamyat"). It grew from 1990 to 1991. Members have been reported to wear black and camouflage uniforms; the group adopted a red and white [[swastika]] emblem and openly expressed admiration for German [[Nazism|national socialism]] and public celebrations of the rise of the Nazis, although the organization officially denied any support for Nazi ideology. The group was active not only in Russia, but also in [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Ukraine]]. The RNU has attempted to unite nationalist groups by organizing Slavonic and then Russian [[Synod#Orthodox usage|sobor]]s. They met with various groups to pursue common goals, but saw little progress.

By the middle of 1993, Russian National Unity had become the most prominent Russian nationalist movement, with a wide network of regional divisions. In addition to engaging in political action, the RNU conducted military drills and tactical training. As the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]] unfolded, the RNU militantly supported the Russian parliament over the president, [[Boris Yeltsin]]. In 1993 it took part in defending and patrolling the "White house" - the residence of the Supreme Council of the [[Russian Federation]] during the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]] against the President's troops. Following Yeltsin's victory, RNU worked illegally for several months. While underground, the movement continued to publish their newspaper ''Russian order''.

The same year, the organization was registered as "a club for military and patriotic upbringing" and later was recognized by local officials as "a volunteer people's self-protection unit". To help achieve its goals, the RNU developed a cadre of armed paramilitaries, known as "Russian [[Bogatyr|Vityazi]]", who were trained in the use of small arms and explosives.

On 15 October 1995, 304 delegates from 37 regional divisions attended a RNU conference in Moscow. In 1999, Moscow’s mayor, [[Yuri Luzhkov]], with the support of higher government officials, prohibited the second RNU regional conference from being held in Moscow. However, the RNU continued to organize.

In 1999, the Moscow headquarters of the group were closed. During the [[second Chechen War]], the RNU supported Russian officers accused of crimes in [[Chechnya]].{{cn|date=October 2010}}

At the peak of its popularity in 1999, RNU was estimated to have 100,000 active members all over Russia by state officials. They are now only a shadow of what they once were, and have been inactive and somewhat dormant for many years now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2013/11/07/RUS42684.E.pdf|title=RESPONSES TO INFORMATION REQUESTS (RIRs)|publisher=[[Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada]]|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 RNU members joined pro-Russian forces in Ukraine during the [[War in Donbass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anton-shekhovtsov.blogspot.de/2014/08/neo-nazi-russian-national-unity-in.html|title=Neo-Nazi Russian National Unity in Eastern Ukraine|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; under commandment of [[Pavel Gubarev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1394442656|title=Putin’s Neo-Nazi Helpers|publisher=[[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group|KHPG]]|date=10 March 2014|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Index design incorporates interdisciplinary concepts from linguistics, cognitive psychology, mathematics, [[Information technology|informatics]], and computer science.  An alternate name for the process in the context of [[search engine]]s designed to find web pages on the Internet is ''[[web indexing]]''.

Popular engines focus on the full-text indexing of online, natural language documents.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, C., Cormack, G.: Dynamic Inverted Indexes for a Distributed Full-Text Retrieval System. TechRep MT-95-01, University of Waterloo, February 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multimedia|Media types]] such as video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sikos |first=L.

[[Metasearch engine|Meta search engines]] reuse the indices of other services and do not store a local index, whereas cache-based search engines permanently store the index along with the [[text corpus|corpus]]. Unlike full-text indices, partial-text services restrict the depth indexed to reduce index size. Larger services typically perform indexing at a predetermined time interval due to the required time and processing costs, while [[Intelligent agent|agent]]-based search engines index in [[Real time business intelligence|real time]].

==Indexing==
The purpose of storing an index is to optimize speed and performance in finding relevant documents for a search query. Without an index, the search engine would [[Lexical analysis|scan]] every document in the [[Text corpus|corpus]], which would require considerable time and computing power.  For example, while an index of 10,000 documents can be queried within milliseconds, a sequential scan of every word in 10,000 large documents could take hours. The additional computer storage required to store the index, as well as the considerable increase in the time required for an update to take place, are traded off for the time saved during information retrieval.

===Index design factors===
Major factors in designing a search engine's architecture include:

; Merge factors : How data enters the index, or how words or subject features are added to the index during text corpus traversal, and whether multiple indexers can work asynchronously. The indexer must first check whether it is updating old content or adding new content. Traversal typically correlates to the [[Web crawling|data collection]] policy. Search engine index merging is similar in concept to the [[Merge (SQL)|SQL Merge]] command and other merge algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, E.W.: Execution Performance Issues in Full-Text Information Retrieval. Computer Science Department, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Technical Report 95-81, October 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Storage techniques : How to store the index [[data]], that is, whether information should be data compressed or filtered.
; Index size : How much computer storage is required to support the index.
; Lookup speed :How quickly a word can be found in the [[inverted index]]. The speed of finding an entry in a data structure, compared with how quickly it can be updated or removed, is a central focus of computer science.
; Maintenance : How the index is maintained over time.&lt;ref&gt;Cutting, D., Pedersen, J.: Optimizations for dynamic inverted index maintenance. Proceedings of SIGIR, 405-411, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Fault tolerance : How important it is for the service to be reliable. Issues include dealing with index corruption, determining whether bad data can be treated in isolation, dealing with bad hardware, [[partition (database)|partitioning]], and schemes such as [[hash function|hash-based]] or composite partitioning,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/partitioning-linear-hash.html Linear Hash Partitioning]. MySQL 5.1 Reference Manual. Verified Dec 2006&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Replication (computer science)|replication]].

===Index data structures===
Search engine architectures vary in the way indexing is performed and in methods of index storage to meet the various design factors.

;[[Suffix tree]] : Figuratively structured like a tree, supports linear time lookup. Built by storing the suffixes of words. The suffix tree is a type of [[trie]]. Tries support [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extendible_hashing extendable hashing], which is important for search engine indexing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/trie.html trie], [https://www.nist.gov/dads Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures], [http://www.nist.gov U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology].&lt;/ref&gt; Used for searching for patterns in [[DNA]] sequences and clustering. A major drawback is that storing a word in the tree may require space beyond that required to store the word itself.&lt;ref name="Gus97"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate representation is a [[suffix array]], which is considered to require less virtual memory and supports data compression such as the [[Burrows-Wheeler transform|BWT]] algorithm.

;[[Inverted index]] : Stores a list of occurrences of each atomic search criterion,&lt;ref&gt;Black, Paul E., [https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/invertedIndex.html inverted index], [https://www.nist.gov/dads Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures], [http://www.nist.gov U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology] Oct 2006. Verified Dec 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; typically in the form of a [[hash table]] or [[binary tree]].&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Foster, Information retrieval: information storage and retrieval using AVL trees, Proceedings of the 1965 20th national conference, p.192-205, August 24–26, 1965, Cleveland, Ohio, United States&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landauer, W. I.: The balanced tree and its utilization in information retrieval. IEEE Trans. on Electronic Computers, Vol. EC-12, No. 6, December 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Citation index]] :Stores citations or hyperlinks between documents to support citation analysis, a subject of [[bibliometrics]].
;[[N-gram|Ngram index]] : Stores sequences of length of data to support other types of retrieval or [[text mining]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006T13 Google Ngram Datasets] for sale at [http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/ LDC] Catalog&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Document-term matrix]] : Used in latent semantic analysis, stores the occurrences of words in documents in a two-dimensional [[sparse matrix]].

===Challenges in parallelism===
A major challenge in the design of search engines is the management of serial computing processes. There are many opportunities for [[race conditions]] and coherent faults. For example, a new document is added to the corpus and the index must be updated, but the index simultaneously needs to continue responding to search queries. This is a collision between two competing tasks. Consider that authors are producers of information, and a [[web crawler]] is the consumer of this information, grabbing the text and storing it in a cache (or [[Text corpus|corpus]]). The forward index is the consumer of the information produced by the corpus, and the inverted index is the consumer of information produced by the forward index. This is commonly referred to as a '''producer-consumer model'''. The indexer is the producer of searchable information and users are the consumers that need to search.  The challenge is magnified when working with distributed storage and distributed processing. In an effort to scale with larger amounts of indexed information, the search engine's architecture may involve [[distributed computing]], where the search engine consists of several machines operating in unison. This increases the possibilities for incoherency and makes it more difficult to maintain a fully synchronized, distributed, parallel architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat. MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters. Google, Inc. OSDI. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inverted indices===
Many search engines incorporate an [[inverted index]] when evaluating a [[Web search query|search query]] to quickly locate documents containing the words in a query and then rank these documents by relevance. Because the inverted index stores a list of the documents containing each word, the search engine can use direct [[random access|access]] to find the documents associated with each word in the query in order to retrieve the matching documents quickly. The following is a simplified illustration of an inverted index:

{| align="center" class="wikitable"
|+Inverted index
|-
! Word !! Documents
|-
| the || Document 1, Document 3, Document 4, Document 5, Document 7
|-
| cow || Document 2, Document 3, Document 4
|-
| says || Document 5
|-
| moo || Document 7
|}

This index can only determine whether a word exists within a particular document, since it stores no information regarding the frequency and position of the word; it is therefore considered to be a [[boolean datatype|boolean]] index. Such an index determines which documents match a query but does not rank matched documents. In some designs the index includes additional information such as the frequency of each word in each document or the positions of a word in each document.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Frieder, Goharian. [http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~juan/CPSC862/Concept-50/IR-Basics-of-Inverted-Index.pdf IR Basics of Inverted Index]. 2002. Verified Aug 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Position information enables the search algorithm to identify word proximity to support searching for phrases; frequency can be used to helto the query. Such topics are the central research focus of [[Information Retrieval Specialist Group|information retrieval]].

The inverted index is a [[sparse matrix]], since not all words are present in each document. To reduce computer storage memory requirements, it is stored differently from a two dimensional [[Array data structure|array]]. The index is similar to the [[document-term matrix|term document matrices]] employed by [[latent semantic analysis]]. The inverted index can be considered a form of a hash table. In some cases the index is a form of a [[binary tree]], which requires additional storage but may reduce the lookup time. In larger indices the architecture is typically a [[distributed hash table]].&lt;ref&gt;Tang, Hunqiang. [[Sandhya Dwarkadas|Dwarkadas, Sandhya]]. "Hybrid Global Local Indexing for Efficient
Peer to Peer Information Retrieval". University of Rochester. Pg 1. http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/sandhya/papers/nsdi04.ps&lt;/ref&gt;

===Index merging===
The inverted index is filled via a merge or rebuild. A rebuild is similar to a merge but first deletes the contents of the inverted index. The architecture may be designed to support incremental indexing,&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic, A., et al.: Incremental Updates of Inverted Lists for Text Document Retrieval. Short Version of Stanford University Computer Science Technical Note STAN-CS-TN-93-1, December, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; where a merge identifies the document or documents to be added or updated and then parses each document into words. For technical accuracy, a merge conflates newly indexed documents, typically residing in virtual memory, with the index cache residing on one or more computer hard drives.

After parsing, the indexer adds the referenced document to the document list for the appropriate words. In a larger search engine, the process of finding each word in the inverted index (in order to report that it occurred within a document) may be too time consuming, and so this process is commonly split up into two parts, the development of a forward index and a process which sorts the contents of the forward index into the inverted index. The inverted index is so named because it is an inversion of the forward index.

===The forward index===
The forward index stores a list of words for each document. The following is a simplified form of the forward index:

{| align="center" class="wikitable"
|+ Forward Index
|-
! Document !! Words
|-
| Document 1 || the,cow,says,moo
|-
| Document 2 || the,cat,and,the,hat
|-
| Document 3 || the,dish,ran,away,with,the,spoon
|}

The rationale behind developing a forward index is that as documents are parsed, it is better to immediately store the words per document.  The delineation enables asynchronous system processing, which partially circumvents the inverted index update [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]].&lt;ref&gt;Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page. [http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine]. [[Stanford University]]. 1998. Verified Dec 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The forward index is [[Sorting algorithm|sorted]] to transform it to an inverted index. The forward index is essentially a list of pairs consisting of a document and a word, collated by the document. Converting the forward index to an inverted index is only a matter of sorting the pairs by the words. In this regard, the inverted index is a word-sorted forward index.

===Compression===
Generating or maintaining a large-scale search engine index represents a significant storage and processing challenge. Many search engines utilize a form of compression to reduce the size of the indices on [[computer storage|disk]].&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Heaps. Storage analysis of a compression coding for a document database. 1NFOR, I0(i):47-61, February 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Consider the following scenario for a full text, Internet search engine.

* It takes 8 bits (or 1 [[byte]]) to store a single character. Some [[character encoding|encodings]] use 2 bytes per character&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/faq/basic_q.html#15 The Unicode Standard - Frequently Asked Questions]. Verified Dec 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uplink.freeuk.com/data.html Storage estimates]. Verified Dec 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The average number of characters in any given word on a page may be estimated at 5 ([[Wikipedia:Size comparisons]])

Given this scenario, an uncompressed index (assuming a non-[[conflation|conflated]], simple, index) for 2 billion web pages would need to store 500 billion word entries. At 1 byte per character, or 5 bytes per word, this would require 2500 gigabytes of storage space alone. This space requirement may be even larger for a fault-tolerant distributed storage architecture. Depending on the compression technique chosen, the index can be reduced to a fraction of this size. The tradeoff is the time and processing power required to perform compression and decompression.

Notably, large scale search engine designs incorporate the cost of storage as well as the costs of electricity to power the storage. Thus compression is a measure of cost.

==Document parsing==
Document parsing breaks apart the components (words) of a document or other form of media for insertion into the forward and inverted indices. The words found are called ''tokens'', and so, in the context of search engine indexing and [[natural language processing]], parsing is more commonly referred to as [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]]. It is also sometimes called [[word boundary disambiguation]], [[Part-of-speech tagging|tagging]], [[text segmentation]], [[content analysis]], text analysis, [[text mining]], [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] generation, [[speech segmentation]], [[Lexical analysis|lexing]], or [[lexical analysis]]. The terms 'indexing', 'parsing', and 'tokenization' are used interchangeably in corporate slang.

Natural language processing is the subject of continuous research and technological improvement. Tokenization presents many challenges in extracting the necessary information from documents for indexing to support quality searching. Tokenization for indexing involves multiple technologies, the implementation of which are commonly kept as corporate secrets.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Challenges in natural language processing===
; Word boundary ambiguity : Native [[English language|English]] speakers may at first consider tokenization to be a straightforward task, but this is not the case with designing a [[multilingual]] indexer.  In digital form, the texts of other languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] represent a greater challenge, as words are not clearly delineated by [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]]. The goal during tokenization is to identify words for which users will search. Language-specific logic is employed to properly identify the boundaries of words, which is often the rationale for designing a parser for each language supported (or for groups of languages with similar boundary markers and syntax).

; Language ambiguity : To assist with properly ranking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dtopseo.com/|title=Search Engine Optimization|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; matching documents, many search engines collect additional information about each word, such as its [[language]] or [[lexical category]] ([[part of speech]]). These techniques are language-dependent, as the syntax varies among languages. Documents do not always clearly identify the language of the document or represent it accurately. In tokenizing the document, some search engines attempt to automatically identify the language of the document.

; Diverse file formats : In order to correctly identify which bytes of a document represent characters, the file format must be correctly handled. Search engines which support multiple file formats must be able to correctly open and access the document and be able to tokenize the characters of the document.

; Faulty storage : The quality of the natural language data may not always be perfect.  An unspecified number of documents, particularly on the Internet, do not closely obey proper file protocol. [[Binary data|Binary]] characters may be mistakenly encoded into various parts of a document. Without recognition of these characters and appropriate handling, the index quality or indexer performance could degrade.

===Tokenization===
Unlike [[literacy|literate]] humans, computers do not understand the structure of a natural language document and cannot automatically recognize words and sentences. To a computer, a document is only a sequence of bytes. Computers do not 'know' that a space character separates words in a document. Instead, humans must program the computer to identify what constitutes an individual or distinct word referred to as a token. Such a program is commonly called a [[tokenizer]] or [[parser]] or [[Lexical analysis|lexer]]. Many search engines, as well as other natural language processing software, incorporate [[Comparison of parser generators|specialized programs]] for parsing, such as [[YACC]] or [[Lex programming tool|Lex]].

During tokenization, the parser identifies sequences of characters which represent words and other elements, such as punctuation, which are represented by numeric codes, some of which are non-printing control characters. The parser can also identify [[Entity extraction|entities]] such as [[email]] addresses, phone numbers, and [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s. When identifying each token, several characteristics may be stored, such as the token's case (upper, lower, mixed, proper), language or encoding, lexical category (part of speech, like 'noun' or 'verb'), position, sentence number, sentence position, length, and line number.

===Language recognition===
If the search engine supports multiple languages, a common initial step during tokenization is to identify each document's language; many of the subsequent steps are language dependent (such as [[stemming]] and [[part of speech]] tagging). [[Language identification|Language recognition]] is the process by which a computer program attempts to automatically identify, or categorize, the [[language]] of a document. Other names for language recognition include language classification, language analysis, language identification, and language tagging. Automated language recognition is the subject of ongoing research in [[natural language processing]]. Finding which language the words belongs to may involve the use of a [[language recognition chart]].

===Format analysis===
If the search engine supports multiple [[File format|document formats]], documents must be prepared for tokenization. The challenge is that many document formats contain formatting information in addition to textual content.  For example, [[HTML]] documents contain HTML tags, which specify formatting information such as new line starts, bold emphasis, and [[font]] size or [[Font family|style]].  If the search engine were to ignore the difference between content and 'markup', extraneous information would be included in the index, leading to poor search results. Format analysis is the identification and handling of the formatting content embedded within documents which controls the way the document is rendered on a computer screen or interpreted by a software program. Format analysis is also referred to as structure analysis, format parsing, tag stripping, format stripping, text normalization, text cleaning and text preparation. The challenge of format analysis is further complicated by the intricacies of various file formats. Certain file formats are proprietary with very little information disclosed, while others are well documented. Common, well-documented file formats that many search engines support include:

* [[HTML]]
* [[ASCII]] text files (a text document without specific computer readable formatting)
* [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]'s Portable Document Format ([[PDF]])
* [[PostScript]] (PS)
* [[LaTeX]]
* [[UseNet]] netnews server formats
* [[XML]] and derivatives like [[RSS]]
* [[SGML]]
* [[Multimedia]] [[meta data]] formats like [[ID3]]
* [[Microsoft Word]]
* [[Microsoft Excel]]
* [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]
* IBM [[Lotus Notes]]
Options for dealing with various formats include using a publicly available commercial parsing tool that is offered by the organization which developed, maintains, or owns the format, and writing a custom [[parser]].

Some search engines support inspection of files that are stored in a [[Compressor (software)|compressed]] or encrypted file format.  When working with a compressed format, the indexer first decompresses the document; this step may result in one or more files, each of which must be indexed separately. Commonly supported [[list of archive formats|compressed file format]]s include:

* [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] - Zip archive file
* [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] - Roshal ARchive file
* [[Cabinet (file format)|CAB]] - [[Microsoft Windows]] Cabinet File
* [[Gzip]] - File compressed with gzip
* [[Bzip2|BZIP]] - File compressed using bzip2
* [[Tar (file format)|Tape ARchive (TAR)]], [[Unix]] archive file, not (itself) compressed
* TAR.Z, TAR.GZ or TAR.BZ2 - [[Unix]] archive files compressed with Compress, GZIP or BZIP2

Format analysis can involve quality improvement methods to avoid including 'bad information' in the index.  Content can manipulate the formatting information to include additional content. Examples of abusing document formatting for [[spamdexing]]:

* Including hundreds or thousands of words in a section which is hidden from view on the computer screen, but visible to the indexer, by use of formatting (e.g. hidden [[Span and div|"div" tag]] in [[HTML]], which may incorporate the use of [[CSS]] or [[JavaScript]] to do so).
* Setting the foreground font color of words to the same as the background color, making words hidden on the computer screen to a person viewing the document, but not hidden to the indexer.

===Section recognition===
Some search engines incorporate section recognition, the identification of major parts of a document, prior to tokenization. Not all the documents in a corpus read like a well-written book, divided into organized chapters and pages.  Many documents on the [[Internet|web]], such as newsletters and corporate reports, contain erroneous content and side-sections which do not contain primary material (that which the document is about). For example, this article displays a side menu with links to other web pages. Some file formats, like HTML or PDF, allow for content to be displayed in columns. Even though the content is displayed, or rendered, in different areas of the view, the raw markup content may store this information sequentially. Words that appear sequentially in the raw source content are indexed sequentially, even though these sentences and paragraphs are rendered in different parts of the computer screen. If search engines index this content as if it were normal content, the quality of the index and search quality may be degraded due to the mixed content and improper word proximity. Two primary problems are noted:

* Content in different sections is treated as related in the index, when in reality it is not
* Organizational 'side bar' content is included in the index, but the side bar content does not contribute to the meaning of the document, and the index is filled with a poor representation of its documents.

Section analysis may require the search engine to implement the rendering logic of each document, essentially an abstract representation of the actual document, and then index the representation instead. For example, some content on the Internet is rendered via JavaScript. If the search engine does not render the page and evaluate the JavaScript within the page, it would not 'see' this content in the same way and would index the document incorrectly. Given that some search engines do not bother with rendering issues, many web page designers avoid displaying content via JavaScript or use the [[Noscript tag]] to ensure that the web page is indexed properly.  At the same time, this fact can also be [[spamdexing|exploited]] to cause the search engine indexer to 'see' different content than the viewer.

===HTML priority system===
{{Original research section|date=November 2013}}
Indexing often has to recognize the [[HTML]] tags to organize priority. Indexing low priority to high margin to labels like ''strong'' and ''link'' to optimize the order of priority if those labels are at the beginning of the text could not prove to be relevant. Some indexers like [[Google]] and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] ensure that the [[search engine]] does not take the large texts as relevant source due to [[strong type system]] compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;Google Webmaster Tools, "Hypertext Markup Language 5", Conference for SEO January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meta tag indexing===
Specific documents often contain embedded meta information such as author, keywords, description, and language. For HTML pages, the [[meta tag]] contains keywords which are also included in the index. Earlier Internet [[search engine technology]] would only index the keywords in the meta tags for the forward index; the full document would not be parsed. At that time full-text indexing was not as well established, nor was [[computer hardware]] able to support such technology.  The design of the HTML markup language initially included support for meta tags for the very purpose of being properly and easily indexed, without requiring tokenization.&lt;ref&gt;Berners-Lee, T., "Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0", RFC 1866, Network Working Group, November 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Internet grew through the 1990s, many [[brick and mortar business|brick-and-mortar corporations]] went 'online' and established corporate websites. The keywords used to describe webpages (many of which were corporate-oriented webpages similar to product brochures) changed from descriptive to marketing-oriented keywords designed to drive sales by placing the webpage high in the search results for specific search queries. The fact that these keywords were subjectively specified was leading to [[spamdexing]], which drove many search engines to adopt full-text indexing technologies in the 1990s. Search engine designers and companies could only place so many 'marketing keywords' into the content of a webpage before draining it of all interesting and useful information.  Given that conflict of interest with the business goal of designing user-oriented websites which were 'sticky', the [[customer lifetime value]] equation was changed to incorporate more useful content into the website in hopes of retaining the visitor. In this sense, full-text indexing was more objective and increased the quality of search engine results, as it was one more step away from subjective control of search engine result placement, which in turn furthered research of full-text indexing technologies.

In [[desktop search]], many solutions incorporate meta tags to provide a way for authors to further customize how the search engine will index content from various files that is not evident from the file content. Desktop search is more under the control of the user, while Internet search engines must focus more on the full text index.

The '''TalkOrigins Archive''' is a [[website]] that presents mainstream science perspectives on the antievolution claims of [[young-earth]], [[Old Earth creationism|old-earth]], and "[[intelligent design]]" creationists. With sections on [[evolution]], [[creationism]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]] and [[Human evolution#Before Homo|hominid evolution]], the web site provides broad coverage of [[evolutionary biology]] and the socio-political antievolution movement.

==Origins and history==
The TalkOrigins Archive began in 1994 when Brett J. Vickers collected several separately posted [[FAQ]]s from the [[talk.origins]] newsgroup and made them available from a single anonymous [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] site. In 1995, Vickers, then a computer science graduate student at the University of California at Irvine, created the TalkOrigins Archive web site. In 2001, Vickers transferred the TalkOrigins Archive to [[Wesley R. Elsberry]], who organized a group of volunteers to handle the maintenance of the Archive.

In 2004, Kenneth Fair incorporated the TalkOrigins Foundation as a Texas [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The TalkOrigins Foundation |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/foundation/index.html | work=The TalkOrigins Archive |accessdate=8 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation's purposes include funding and maintaining the TalkOrigins Archive and holding copyrights to Archive articles, thereby simplifying the process of reprinting and updating those articles. The [[copyright]] issue has posed a particular problem since the FAQs started off as a small collection with little thought given to copyright but have since mushroomed. In 2005, the Foundation was granted tax-exempt status by the [[IRS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/PartnerReport.aspx?Partner=networkforgood&amp;ein=33-1092765|title=TALKORIGINS FOUNDATION INC|work=[[GuideStar]]|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The [[FAQ]]s and FRAs (Frequently Rebutted Assertions) on the TalkOrigins Archive cover a wide range of topics associated with evolutionary biology and creationism. These include Mark Isaak's Index to Creationist Claims, a list of creationist positions on various issues, rebuttals, and links to primary source material. The TalkDesign site fulfills a similar role with the [[Intelligent Design]] movement. Also hosted is Jim Foley's Fossil Hominids sub-site which studies the evidence for [[human evolution]] and has an extensive list of links to websites on both evolutionary biology and creationism. Lastly, the Quote Mine Project examines the use of [[Quote mining]]{{spaced ndash}}taking quotes out of context{{spaced ndash}}by creationists. The feedback system collects reader comments and posts a compilation, along with responses, each month. The archive maintains a sister site which addresses Intelligent Design arguments.

==Awards and recognition==
Talkorigins.org has gained awards and recognition over the years:

* In 1999, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called TalkOrigins a "good antidote" to the plethora of creationist websites that had sprung up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/06/technology/screen-grab-exploring-neanderthal-lore-on-line.html | title=SCREEN GRAB; Exploring Neanderthal Lore on Line | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=6 May 1999 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | last=Pollak | first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Teylers Challenge april 2012 - 7060.JPG|thumb|right|Instrument Room taken from the doorway to the Fossil room 2, with [[leyden jar]]s in the foreground]]
The '''Instrument Room''' is a room in [[Teylers Museum]] which houses a part of the museum's ''Cabinet of Physics'': a collection of scientific instruments from the 18th and 19th centuries. The instruments in the collection were used for research as well as for educational public demonstrations. Most of them are demonstration models that illustrate various aspects of electricity, acoustics, light, magnetism, thermodynamics, and weights and measures. The rest are high-quality precision instruments that were used for research.

==History of the room==
Originally all of the museum's collections were housed in the [[Teylers Oval Room|Oval Room]] from 1784. The electricity instrument demonstrations tended to make a lot of noise and distracted the readers of the books in the gallery, and after the mineralogical cabinet was built for the center of the room, demonstrations there became more difficult and a new demonstration and lecture room was built on the north side (today the Print room). This new room shared its purpose with the art gallery but as the number of instrument cabinets increased, was felt to be too dark, leading to the creation of a separate [[Teylers Eerste Schilderijenzaal|painting gallery]] in 1838. The current instrument room was built as part of an 1880-1885 extension of the museum, designed to have daylight from both sides for better viewing of the experiments. It is located between the [[Teylers Fossil Room II|Fossil Room II]] and the Oval Room.

==History of the collection==
Though [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]] was a patron of the arts and sciences, he was not a member of the ''Natuur- en Sterrekundig Collegie'', a science society in Haarlem that was founded in the Patientiestraat in 1775. The popularity of the study of science and the ideals of the Dutch enlightenment were such that after his death however, when Martin van Marum joined the young [[Teylers Stichting]], this proved quickly to become the emphasis of the society in the years to come. Teylers Museum was not alone. The society ''[[Oefening door Wetenschappen]]'' was also started in Haarlem in 1798 and lasted until 1892. It was Haarlem's reputation for the study of science that attracted Van Marum to settle there. When he became director of the collection of the [[Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen]] in 1778 and later, also of Teylers in 1784, he used the funds of both institutions to purchase expensive instruments and even whole scientific collections from personal estates. He started before he even worked there with a proposal to build his large ''[[Large electrostatic generator (Teylers)|elektriseermachine]]'' that forms the center attraction of the instrument room. Van Marum was not only the curator of the cabinet, he gave public ''laboratorium'' lectures from 1777-1803 on physics and geology. The number of demonstration models in the collection is directly related to his and his successors' need for demonstration models in Teylers lectures. Van Marum collected 350 demonstration models and set a precedent as lecturer-demonstrator for curators who came after him. Today there are over a thousand in the collection altogether.

== Instruments on display ==
The centerpiece of the Instrument Room is the large electrostatic generator built by [[John Cuthbertson (instrument maker)|John Cuthbertson]] in 1784. This apparatus is the largest flat-plate electrostatic generator of the world and the oldest piece in the room itself, which is filled mostly with items from the 19th century. Surrounding this centerpiece are 10 numbered cabinets filled with instruments accompanied by numbered cards that can be cross-referenced to a guide located in the room.

'''''The Bletchley Circle''''' is a television mystery drama [[miniseries]], set in 1952–53, about four women who worked as [[Cryptanalysis|codebreakers]] at [[Bletchley Park]].

== Plot ==
Susan Gray, Millie, Lucy, and Jean work together at [[Bletchley Park]] to decipher [[Bletchley Park#German signals|German military codes]] for the British military, during [[World War II]]. After a brief introduction of the four women at Bletchley during the war, the series begins in 1952, seven years after the war's end, when Susan, Millie, Lucy, and Jean have returned to their ordinary lives. As the story begins, Susan learns about a series of murders that has occurred in the London area and begins to recognize patterns connecting the killings. This inspires her to return to her codebreaking past, and she reaches out first to Millie, and then to Lucy and Jean, after unsuccessfully trying to convince the police to follow up her theory about the crimes.

As they all signed [[Official Secrets Act 1939|orders of secrecy]] about their work during the war, the two married women (Susan and Lucy), disguise their activities from their husbands as a [[Book discussion club|book club]]. Failing to secure police involvement, they move from codebreaking and investigation into the realm of field work, with dangerous consequences on several occasions. Scenes of domestic tranquility are contrasted with scenes of the killer stalking and torturing his victims. While initially skeptical about becoming involved, Millie, Jean, and Lucy are convinced to help Susan once they realize the lives of many women are on the line.

The series contrasts the conventional but very different lives of the four women and the sense of usefulness they felt while codebreaking during the war.  In the Series 1 finale, the women are forced to confront the man they suspect to be the killer.

==Allusions to real events==

The premise of the series is based on the women who worked at [[Bletchley Park]] during World War II, who for the most part did not continue in intelligence work, and under the rules of the [[Official Secrets Act 1939]] in the UK never shared the nature of their contributions to crucial aspects of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/mavis-batey-bletchley-park-code-breaker-in-world-war-ii-dies-at-92/2013/11/16/ef8682cc-4d49-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html |title=Mavis Batey, Bletchley Park code breaker in World War II, dies at 92 |date=17 November 2013 |publisher=The Washington Post |author=Emily Langer |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/ |title=Bletchley Park History |accessdate=20 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/wwiis-female-codebreakers.html |title=WWII’s Female Code-breakers in Bletchley Park |date=19 November 2013 |accessdate=20 April 2014 |publisher=War History On Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2533366/The-REAL-Bletchley-Circle-Fascinating-work-female-codebreakers-World-War-II-revealed.html |title=The REAL Bletchley Circle: Fascinating work of female codebreakers of World War II revealed |date=13 January 2014 |publisher=Mail Online |author=Ruth Styles |accessdate=20 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second series, one character refers to [[sarin#History|sarin]] gas as having been developed by the Germans during World War II, along with other such chemical weapons, then taken up by the former Allies. The UK did have an incident of a young man killed from experiments with the gas in 1953; in 2004, his inquest was reopened, and the cause of death was altered from death by misadventure to death by "application of a nerve agent in a non-therapeutic experiment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/4013767.stm |publisher=BBC News Online |title=Nerve gas death was 'unlawful' |date=15 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Upon its U.S. premiere—which occurred in prime time following U.S. episodes of ''[[Call the Midwife]]'' and ''[[Mr Selfridge]]''—''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called ''The Bletchley Circle'' "smart, addictive and situated in a fascinating historical moment".&lt;ref name="var2013"/&gt; In a review of the first series, ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the series finds "a clever, entertaining way to pay tribute to women who in their time were often overlooked and underestimated, and nevertheless found ways to never be ordinary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/20/arts/television/the-bletchley-circle-on-pbs.html |title=Secret War Heroes, Hiding New Work From Husbands |first=Alessandra |last=Stanley |date=19 April 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mistress of the Copper Mountain became a well known character from her appearance in [[Pavel Bazhov]]'s collection of the Ural Mountains folktales (also known as ''[[skaz]]'') called ''[[The Malachite Box]]''. The Mistress appears in the third ''skaz'', "[[The Mistress of the Copper Mountain (fairy tale)|The Mistress of the Copper Mountain]]" and in 9 other stories from the collection, including "[[The Stone Flower]]", "[[List of stories within The Malachite Box#The Manager's Boot-Soles|The Manager's Boot-Soles]]", "[[List of stories within The Malachite Box#Sochen and His Stones|Sochen and His Stones]]".

==Characteristics==
The Mistress of the Copper Mountain has the appearance of an extremely beautiful young woman with green eyes. Some of her more distinctive features include dark [[braided hair]], ribbons from thin tinkling [[copper]], and a gown that is made from [[malachite]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt; She wears a diadem decorated with malachite and precious stones.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite book|title=Soviet Life.

The sacral being, the Mistress was surrounded by rituals and [[taboo]]s, e.g. women did not come down in the mine, because it was the Mistress's domain, and young men seeking her patronage did not marry. The violation of the taboos was supposed to bring a harsh punishment.&lt;ref name="deconstruction"/&gt; Children were taught not to shout and quarrel next to the stones, and to keep quiet in the mines, because, according to popular belief, the Maid disliked loud noises.&lt;ref&gt;Nikulina 2003, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Her distinguishing attributes were lizards, copper and malachite.

===The Azov Girl===
In many national folktales, the Mistress and [[Azovka]] (lit. "the Azov Girl") are identical with each other,&lt;ref&gt;Blazhes 1983, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and the same stories are told about each of them. The tales about Azovka are very different from one another, although they share some common characteristics. Firstly, that there's a cave with hidden treasures inside [[Mount Azov]]. Secondly, few people found the cave, and no one could get the treasures. The treasures belong to the Tatars, the [[Bashkirs]], or "the Old People".&lt;ref name="bibliogid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibliogid.ru/krug-chteniya/mify-legendy-narodnye-skazki/1019-bazhov-p-p-malakhitovaya-shkatulka|title=Bazhov P.

== Appearances ==

=== In ''The Malachite Box'' ===
The Mistress of the Copper Mountain appears in the third [[Pavel Bazhov]]'s ''skaz'' from ''The Malachite Box'', "[[The Mistress of the Copper Mountain (fairy tale)|The Mistress of the Copper Mountain]]", first published in the 11th issue of ''Krasnaya Nov'' in 1936;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bazhov|first=Pavel|authorlink=Pavel Bazhov|title=Works. In Three Volumes |volume=1|date=1976|publisher=[[Pravda (publisher)|Pravda]]|location=Moscow|language=Russian |page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in many other tales: "[[The Malachite Casket (fairy tale)|The Malachite Casket]]", "[[The Stone Flower]]", "[[List of stories within The Malachite Box#The Manager's Boot-Soles|The Manager's Boot-Soles]]", "[[List of stories within The Malachite Box#Sochen and His Stones|Sochen and His Stones]]", "[[The Malachite Box#The Master Craftsman|The Master Craftsman]]", "[[List of stories within The Malachite Box#The Two Lizards|The Two Lizards]]", "[[List of stories within The Malachite Box#A Fragile Twig|A Fragile Twig]]", "[[List of stories within The Malachite Box#The Grass Hideaway|The Grass Hideaway]]", and "[[List of stories within The Malachite Box#Tayutka's Mirror|Tayutka's Mirror]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fantlab.ru/work89037|title=Уральские сказы|publisher=[[FantLab]]|language=Russian|accessdate=1 December 2015|trans-title = Tales from the Urals }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bazhov 1952, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Bazhov confirmed that he based the character on local legends. He said: "Yes, I believe that the series of tales connected with the Gumyoshevsky mine is closer to folklore. In my opinion, they represent the attempt to reconstruct the folklore of this mine". When asked whether the character from his writing differs from its folklore interpretation, Bazhov replied: "I don't believe there is a difference. If there is, it is bad [news]".&lt;ref name="Mironov"&gt;Mironov, A. "''Obraz Hozjajki Mednoj gory v skazah P. P. Bazhova'' Образ Хозяйки Медной горы в сказах П. П. Бажова [The character of the Mistress of the Copper Mountain in P. P. Bazhov's tales]" in: ''P. P. Bazhov i socialisticheskij realizm.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[The Mistress of the Copper Mountain (fairy tale)|The Mistress of the Copper Mountain]]" she is described as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You could see from her plait she was a maid. It was a sort of deep black, that plait of hers, and didn't dangle as our maids' do, but lay close and straight down her back. And the ribbons at the end weren't quite red and weren't quite green, they'd something of both. You could see the light shining through them and they seemed to click a little, like thin leaves of copper. [...] She was not very tall, with a pretty figure, and she was a real fidget - couldn't sit still a minute. [...] Her robe, now, it was something you'd never see anywhere else. It was all made of silk malachite, that's a kind you get sometimes. It's stone but it looks like silk, you want to take and stroke it.&lt;ref&gt;Bazhov 1950s, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "[[The Stone Flower]]" it's said that the Mistress has her own "mountain craftsmen":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
They're skilful craftsmen who live in the mountain, and no man ever sees them. Whatever the Mistress wants, they  make it for her. I saw a bit of their work once. [...] Our serpents, no matter how good they are, they're but stone, but this was like as if it was living. A black line down the black, and eyes—ye'd think it was just going to up and sting ye. They can make anything!&lt;ref&gt;Bazhov 1950s, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "The Manager's Boot-Soles" it's said that the Mistress "didn't like it when folks were treated ill underground".&lt;ref&gt;Bazhov 1950s, pp. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; She appears before the cruel bailiff:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All of a sudden the bailiff saw a figure in front of him. It was moving lightly, waving a lamp. At the turn of the gallery he saw it was a woman. [...] He started running after her, but his faithful men weren't in any great hurry to follow. They were all shaking.  Because they saw this was bad — it was ''she'' herself. [...] The bailiff saw a maid of amazing beauty standing before him, and here brows were drawn together in a line and her eyes blazed like burning coals.&lt;ref&gt;Bazhov 1950s, pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Malachite Box'', she serves as a "magic helper" to the characters.&lt;ref name="Balina269"&gt;Balina 2013, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; "It's a chancy thing to meet her, it brings woe for a bad man".&lt;ref&gt;Bazhov 1950s, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; She can be reached through the stone forest.&lt;ref name="Shvabauer 2009, p. 146"&gt;Shvabauer 2009, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; She is cruel and just, she dislikes greedy people and is indifferent toward their suffering, but she shows her benevolent side to those with talent and selflessness.&lt;ref&gt;Meshcherova 2014, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valentin Blazhes]] stated that in ''the Malachite Box'' she is a classical [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] character, because she combines good and evil, life and death, beauty and ugliness. Nataliya Shvabauer commented that her duality is represented in her every trait, from the appearance to her functions.&lt;ref name="prikazchikova"/&gt; Even her jokes can be deadly, as evident from "Sochen and His Stones".&lt;ref name="binarity"/&gt;

===In other media===
The character Queen of the Copper Mountain appeared in [[Mercedes Lackey]]'s 2007 novel ''[[Fortune's Fool (novel)|Fortune's Fool]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kniga.ompural.ru/content.php?main=kniga_life&amp;id=100003|title=The Malachite Box|publisher=The Live Book Museum.

[[Shimun Vrochek]] authored a story called ''The Master of the Copper Mountain'' ({{lang-rus|Хозяин Медной горы|Hozjain Mednoj gory|links=no}}), in which he mentioned the character.

[[Vladimir Makanin]] writes the Mistress parody characters in some of his stories, such as the mother of the character Kolka in his 1976 short story "Voices" ({{lang-rus|Голоса|Golosa|links=no}}).&lt;ref name="deconstruction"/&gt;

== Origin and development ==

Pavel Bazhov had heard the tales about her at the [[Polevskoy Copper Smelting Plant]] from the miners' storyteller Vasily Hmelinin ({{lang-rus|Василий Хмелинин|links=no}}), nicknamed "Grandpa Slyshko" by children.&lt;ref name="Blazh9"/&gt; "The Copper Mountain" is believed to be the [[Gumyoshevsky mine]],&lt;ref name="Blazh9"/&gt; the oldest mine of the Ural Mountains. It was sometimes called "The Copper Mountain" or simply "The Mountain" by the populace.&lt;ref name="foreword1939"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bazhov|first=Pavel|year=1939|title=Foreword to the Skazy|journal=[[Oktyabr (magazine)|Oktyabr]]|issue=5–6|page=158|issn=0132-0637|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valery Dyomin]] commented that the Mistress is a universal [[mytheme]], while the Copper mountain is the specific location: the Gumyoshevsky mine and [[Mount Azov]].&lt;ref name="deconstruction"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulikova|first=E.

The origin of the character is unclear. A concept of a [[mother goddess]] or [[Mat Zemlya|Mother Earth]] was very popular in every culture, including the local [[Mansi people|Mansi]] and [[Khanty people]].&lt;ref name="Shvabauer 2009, p. 146"/&gt; The Ural ethnographer A. Sagalayev suggested that the character originated from the goddesses [[Umay]] and [[Kaltes-Ekwa]]. He noted that the figure of a mother goddess in people's perception sometimes shrinks to the size of a rock and a sculpture or expands to the size of a mountain.&lt;ref name="deconstruction"/&gt; The Mistress might have appeared as a successor of Azovka, because she was most famous in the same areas as Azovka before her, so the keeper of treasures slowly turned into their master.&lt;ref name="Shvabauer147"&gt;Shvabauer 2009, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Bazhov believed that the most ancient creature of the Ural mythology was in fact Azovka, [[the Great Serpent]] appeared next, and the last one was the Mistress.&lt;ref name="prikazchikova"/&gt; Just like Azovka, the Malachite Maid attracts single men.&lt;ref&gt;Shvabauer 2009, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Lipovetsky commented her black hair colour hints at her non-Slavic parentage, possibly from the "Old People", like Azovka.&lt;ref name="Lipovetsky217"/&gt; Dark-haired and mysterious, she does not look like typical Russian girls.&lt;ref&gt;Meshcherova 2014, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Bazhov believed that miners simply missed women, because their work allowed for little contact with them.&lt;ref name="binarity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zherdev|first=Denis|year=2003 |title= Binarnost kak element pojetiki bazhovskikh skazov |script-title = ru:Бинарность как элемент поэтики бажовских сказов |journal=Izvestiya of the Ural State University|issue=28 |pages=46–57|url= http://elar.urfu.ru/bitstream/10995/24181/1/iurg-2003-28-06.pdf|language=Russian |trans-title = Binarity as the Poetic Element in Bazhov's Skazy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also thought that the Mistress outgrew her initial function of a treasure keeper. She became "the embodiment of power, wealth and beauty" which revealed itself only before the best of people.&lt;ref name="oldmine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bazhov|first=Pavel|title=У старого рудника  |trans-title = By the Old Mine|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=Hmp6b9Ugq2MC&amp;dq|series=The Malachite Casket: Tales from the Urals|date=2014-07-10|publisher=Litres|language=Russian|isbn=9785457073548}}&lt;/ref&gt; E. Kulikova theorized that her place in the Ural mythology is most likely connected with the perception of the mountains as "magical space". The mountain was the source of life, the protector from hostile forces and the residence of divine patrons.&lt;ref name="deconstruction"/&gt;

[[Alexei Ivanov (writer)|Alexei Ivanov]] suggested that the Mistress most likely originates from a [[spirit of place]] as a "stone [[dryad]]".&lt;ref name="philolog"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ivanov|first=Alexei|year=2004  |trans-title = The Ugrian Archetype in the Demonology of Bazhov's Stories   |title=Угорский архетип в демонологии сказов Бажова|journal=The Philologist|issue=5|issn=2076-4154|url=http://philolog.pspu.ru/module/magazine/do/mpub_5_90}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a hypothesis that she repsesents the Roman goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], as local copper from the [[Polevskoy Copper Smelting Plant]] was branded with the [[Venus symbol]] (♀) for tens of years in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perfilyev|first=A.|title=Полевской край: Историко-краеведческий сборник |trans-title = Polevskoy region: the local history|url=http://www.polevskoylife.ru/e/410097-gerb-i-simvolyi-polevskogo|edition=1|volume=3|year=1998|publisher=Uraltreid|language=Russian|chapter=Герб и символы Полевского}}&lt;/ref&gt; V. Bezrukova theorizes that the Mistress of the Copper Mountain symbolizes the "relationship" between people and the mountain riches, and that she in fact protects [[Christian virtues]], e.g. she prevents greed, encourages kindness, modesty, honor and skill (Christian virtues).&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt; However Alexei Ivanov argues that she reveals her "genetic relationship" with [[pagan god]]s, and her ethics is not Christian.&lt;ref name="philolog"/&gt; In one of the stories she takes the gold out of the mine after a church is built nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Shvabauer 2009, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya Nikulina points at her relation to the [[realm of the dead]], as she does not ear or drink, does not leave any traces, her clothing is made of stone and so on, and the Mountain connects her to the world of the living.&lt;ref name="Shvabauer147"/&gt; The character might be of [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] origin.&lt;ref name="Vernikov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulc-russia.com/fun/people_talk/item/91/|title=Translations From Pavel Bazhov into English. Part 1|last=Vernikov|first=Alexander|publisher=ULC: Ural Life &amp; Culture|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Finno-Ugric peoples, who lived in that area, later migrated to the [[Baltic Sea]] or assimilated into the new Russian culture. Their folklore featured the underground riches, moral and spiritual powers, impersonated in [[Chthonic]] deities, mining and metallurgic techniques unknown to Russians.&lt;ref name="Vernikov"/&gt;

The Mistress's attributes—lizards, copper and malachite—are not Christian. Nataliya Shvabauer commented that the lizards are foul supernatural creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Shvabauer 2009, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The images of lizards and snakes were found on the [[Permian bronze casts]] (the 5-15 centuries) around [[Mount Azov]].&lt;ref name="philolog"/&gt; Copper was a symbol of female beauty at the Urals. Malachite symbolized youth, hope, misfortune and grief at the same time.&lt;ref name="prikazchikova"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prikazchikova|first=Yelena|year=2003 |trans-title = The Stone Force of The Ural Copper Mountains|title= Kamennaja sila mednykh gor Urala|script-title = ru:Каменная сила медных гор Урала|journal=Izvestiya of the Ural State University|volume=28|pages=11–23|language=Russian |url=http://elar.urfu.ru/bitstream/10995/24166/1/iurg-2003-28-02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The craftsmen who worked with malachite often died of [[tuberculosis]], affected by the poisonous malachite dust. The [[gemcutter]]s produced malachite jewellery for sale only, but never wore it themselves. Keeping it in the house was a bad [[omen]].&lt;ref name="prikazchikova"/&gt;

== Reception ==
The Mistress became a popular character in the Soviet Union. The [[Folkloristics|folklorists]] of [[the Ural State University]], who collected tales near [[Sysert]] after Pavel Bazhov's death, noted they "have not met a single person who did not hear about the Mistress", but they mostly knew about her from Bazhov's ''skazy'' and referred to them: "Read some Bazhov, he wrote it down". Few story-tellers heard of her from [[oral tradition]].&lt;ref name="Blazh9"/&gt; 

During Soviet times critics commonly described this character as the protector of the working class from the oppressors. Maya Nikulina argued that the Mistress is neither the rescuer nor the protector. Rather than defending the workers, she tests them. Social justice is of no concern to her: "the landlord is punished for being greedy and stupid", not for being the landlord.&lt;ref&gt;Nikulina 2003, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Lipovetsky commented that she is the most terrifying characters of the collection, a beautiful girl and a dangerous demonic creature at the same time.&lt;ref name="Lipovetsky217"&gt;Lipovetsky 2014, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that she represents the struggle and unity between [[Eros and Thanatos]],&lt;ref&gt;Lipovetsky 2014, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; and that she is characterized by three major Freudian motives—the [[Libido|sexual drive]], the [[death drive]] (her realm is the realm of the dead) and the [[castration anxiety]] (loss of power).&lt;ref name="Lipovetsky217"/&gt; The latter is shown when she persistently and spitefully provokes the local administration, forcing the protagonists ("The Mistress of the Copper Mountain", "The Two Lizards") to relay offensive messages.&lt;ref&gt;Lipovetsky 2014, p. 222–223.&lt;/ref&gt; Denis Zherdev pointed out that the Mistress's female domain is the world of chaos, destruction or spontaneous uncontrolled acts of creation. Colliding with the ordered factory world, such power brings in randomness, variability, unpredictability and capriciousness. Direct contact with it is a violation of world order, and does not end well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mith.ru/alb/lib/bazov/mim2_1.htm|title=Poetika skazov Bazhova |script-title = ru:Поэтика сказов Бажова| trans-title =The poetics of Bazhov's stories|last=Zherdev|first=Denis|publisher=Research Library Mif.Ru|language=Russian|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of ''The Fairy Tale Encyclopedia'' suggests that the Mistress represents the conflict between human kind and nature. She compares the character with [[Mephistopheles]], because a human needs to [[Deal with the Devil|wager his soul]] with her in order to get the ultimate knowledge, however, the Mistress does not force anyone to abandon their moral values, and therefore "is not painted in dark colours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Budur|first=Naralya|title=The Fairy Tale Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_X49ywrpGS8C|year=2005|publisher=Olma Media Group|language=Russian|isbn=9785224048182|page=285|chapter=The Mistress of the Copper Mountain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyudmila Skorino believed that she represented the nature of the Urals, which inspires a creative person with its beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Bazhov 1952, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Singing Detective''''' is a 2003 American [[Musical film|musical]] [[Crime film|crime]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Keith Gordon]] and loosely based on the [[The Singing Detective|BBC serial of the same name]], a work by British writer [[Dennis Potter]]. It stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] and features a supporting cast that includes [[Katie Holmes]], [[Adrien Brody]], [[Robin Wright|Robin Wright Penn]], and [[Mel Gibson]], as well as a number of songs from the 1950s.

==Plot==
Suffering from the skin disease [[psoriasis]] and crippling [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[detective]] novelist Dan Dark is in such pain in a hospital that he begins to delve into fantasy, resulting in several storylines told simultaneously:
* A [[film noir]] based on Dark's novel, ''The Singing Detective'', in which a [[nightclub act|nightclub singer]]/private eye, hired by Mark Binney, takes on a strange case involving prostitutes and two mysterious men. Nothing is ever solved from this, only a vague plot. Notably, all of the people in the film noir are played by people who are real people in Dark's life; for example, Dark's nurse plays a singer.
* The present reality, in which Dark is tormented by incredible pain. Dark interacts with the various people around him, as the doctors and nurses attempt to help, but are dismissed by Dark's anger and bitterness towards everyone. His sense of reality then collapses into hallucinations as the people randomly sing choreographed musical numbers, such as "How Much Is That Doggie In The Window?" In the end, his reality is blended with the film noir and he is abducted by the two mysterious men, only to be shot by the titular "singing detective".
* Dark's traumatic childhood in the past, which explains Dark's repulsion toward sexuality (Dark had watched his mother have sex with other men, including his father's business partner), and his own fiery temper.

==Production==
Potter's screenplay had been circulating in Hollywood for many years as Potter was enthusiastic about a film version. [[Robert Altman]] was at one time attached to direct with [[Dustin Hoffman]] in the lead, but financing proved difficult and the production was shelved. It was eventually discovered by an executive at [[Mel Gibson]]'s production company [[Icon Productions]], who loved it and got Gibson on board to produce. The screenplay had also been imagined as a [[horror film]] directed by genre veteran [[David Cronenberg]] and starring [[Al Pacino]] as the title character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314676/trivia|title=The Singing Detective|date=November 14, 2003|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film scored a 39% "Rotten" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the consensus being 'Delightful performance from Robert Downey Jr. can't save ''The Singing Detective'''s transition from TV to the big screen'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/singing_detective/|title=The Singing Detective|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some critics, such as [[Roger Ebert]], liked the film, others, like Joe Baltake at the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'', considered it an "interesting failure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/singing_detective/|title=The Singing Detective|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to ''The Singing Detective'' was released on October 14, 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13572">"'''Wið færstice'''" is an [[Old English language|Old English]] medical text surviving in the collection known now as ''[[Lacnunga]]'' in the [[British Library]]. "Wið færstice" means 'against a sudden/violent stabbing pain'; and according to Felix Grendon, whose collection of Anglo-Saxon charms appeared in the Journal of American Folklore in 1908, “the charm is intended to cure a sudden twinge or stitch, possibly rheumatism that can be due to being shot by witches, elves, and other spirits that fly through the air.” Scholars have often sought to identify this as [[rheumatism]], but other possibilities should not be excluded. The remedy describes how to make a salve, but its main interest lies in the unique [[spell (paranormal)|charm]] which follows. This describes how the ''færstice'' has been caused by the projectiles of 'mighty women' (''ða mihtigan wif''), whom the healer will combat. The charm also mentions [[elf|elves]], believed responsible for [[elfshot]], and provides the only attestation outside personal names of the Old English form of the name of the Old [[Norsemen|Norse]] gods, the [[Æsir]].

As with many old Anglo-Saxon charms, it is presumed that physical gestures were intended to accompany the recitation of the text. In this case, the "Wið færstice" is intended to be accompanied by boiling [[feverfew]], [[Lamium purpureum|red nettle]] grown in grain, and [[Plantago|plantain]], then boiling it all in a bowl of [[butter]]. A knife is dipped into the potion and then rubbed against the source of pain. Despite the popular use of the aforementioned herbs in forms of remedial healing, it is important to note that the usage of these plants may have been more symbolic than practical. Many old Anglo-Saxon charms draw upon the symbolism of both pagan traditions as well as ancient Christian traditions, and the usage of plants in the texts were likely related to these religious references.

== Content ==

The first seventeen lines of the "Wið færstice" have been referred to as its "epic introduction".{{sfn|Chickering Jr.|1971|p=85}}
Howell D. Chickering Junior expressed the view that there "probably is no epic or mythic narrative" behind this introductory section, instead arguing that it should be seen as "a dramatic verbal performance".{{sfn|Chickering Jr.|1971|pp=86–87}} As edited and translated by Alaric Hall, the text runs:

== Date ==

The age of "Wið færstice" has been hard to judge.{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=109}}
Considering all of the available evidence, Medieval literature specialist Alaric Hall deemed it probable that the charm was a "cultural artefact" from the late tenth century.{{sfn|Hall|2007|pp=109–110}}

== Interpretation ==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="Scholars have debated issues of interpretation for decades, usually proceeding from the assumption that the charm rehearses one or more themes from mythology. Is the smith [[Wayland the Smith|Weland]]? Are the mighty women valkyries or witches? Are the loud riders valkyries or the [[Wild Hunt]]?"|source=— Stephen Pollington, 2000.{{sfn|Pollington|2000|p=474}} }}

Early examinations of the Anglo-Saxon poetic charms were largely focused on determining which elements within them derived from the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pre-Christian belief systems]] of the Anglo-Saxons.{{sfn|Chickering Jr.|1971|p=83}} Accordingly, attention was paid to "Wið færstice", which was deemed to be "one of the three or four charms apparently richest in pagan references."{{sfn|Chickering Jr.|1971|p=83}} With the exception of the closing benediction, the charm lacks any obvious Christian references,{{sfn|Jolly|1996|p=139}} with Jolly accordingly believing that from modern understandings of Christianity, it would seem "overwhelmingly ''not'' Christian".{{sfn|Jolly|1996|p=139}} She however cautioned against viewing it as either non-Christian on the one hand, or as pagan on the other.{{sfn|Jolly|1996|p=140}} She highlighted that the presumed pagan elements within it all reflected "areligious folklore, transferable from one religious tradition to another", while it was produced by people living in Late Anglo-Saxon England who would have considered themselves to be Christian and who felt no need to highly Christianise it.{{sfn|Jolly|1996|p=140}}

=== Medical perspective ===

It is not known what medical symptom the Old English term ''færstice'' refers to in this charm.{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=110}} Several scholars to have studied the charm, such as [[Godfrid Storms]] and Howell D. Chickering Jr., expressed the view that it referred to [[rheumatism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Storms|1y=1948|1p=145|2a1=Chickering Jr.|2y=1971|2p=83}}
Although noting that prior interpretations of the charm had suggested that the ''færstice'' referred to [[rheumatism]] or [[lumbago]], the Anglo-Saxonist [[Stephen Pollington]] opined that there were "no compelling reasons" to accept either explanation, instead expressing the view that it should be regarded as a reference to "any sharp, unexpected pain".{{sfn|Pollington|2000|p=474}}

=== Supernatural elements ===

Hall was of the view that "Wið færstice" "constructs a strong distinction between in-group (the patient and healer) and harmful out-group (the supernatural beings)."{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=116}}

Hall expressed the view that the poem "provides a key to interpreting the cultural significance of ''ælfe'' in medieval texts".{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=108}}
Given his argument that in "earlier Anglo-Saxon beliefs", ''ælfe'' were "probably primarily or only male", he considered it interesting that in this charm they are cited alongside the female ''hægtessan''.{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=108}}

=== Parallels and analogues ===

Hall identified an earlier parallel in [[Aldhelm]]'s poetic ''[[Carmen de virginitate]]'', specifically the passage in lines 2635–42 in which he describes [[Allecto]], one of the ''[[Furiae]]'' of [[Classical mythology]].{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=111}} In this passage, Allecto is described as bringing "iron-tipped spears to battle, which would cause jagged wounds to holy souls".{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=111}} Hall noted that this use of iron-tipped spears could not have been adopted straight from Classical sources, where Allecto and the Furies cause harm using snakes rather than spears.{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=111}} Rather, he compared the use of the Furies' spears to the spears of the ''hægtesse'' in "Wið færstice", bolstering this connection by noting that in the eighth century [[Cleopatra Glossaries|Third Cleopatra Glossary]], the Latin word ''furiarum'' is given the Old English gloss of ''hægtessa''.{{sfn|Hall|2007|pp=111–112}}

Hall also argued that there was a "remarkable parallel" between "Wið færstice" and the accounts of magical practices provided by [[Isobel Gowdie]], a Scottish woman accused of witchcraft in 1662, during her confessions.{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=114}} Gowdie claimed that she rode through the air on straw with her fellow witches, firing "elf-arrows" at her victims; these had been acquired from the [[Devil]], who had been aided in their creation by "Elf-boyes". Hall stated that this exhibited a general similarity to the account provided in "Wið færstice".{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=114}} He also thought there were parallels between the two accounts in terms of their use of smiths; in both, one smith (the Devil in Gowdie's account) is part of a wider group of smiths.{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=114}}
While acknowledging "the great gap of time" – lasting around seven centuries – between the two accounts, Hall noted that "charm-texts and related traditions" could be transmitted across this gap of time, citing the example of the [[Merseburg Incantations|Second Merseburg Charm]] as an example.{{sfn|Hall|2007|p=114}}

The '''Yongle Emperor''' ('''Yung-lo''' in [[Wade–Giles]]; 2 May 1360 – 12 August 1424) — personal name '''Zhu Di''' (WG: '''Chu Ti''') — was the third [[List of emperors of the Ming dynasty|emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] in [[China]], reigning from 1402 to 1424.

Zhu Di was the fourth son of the [[Hongwu Emperor]], the founder of the Ming dynasty. He was originally [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] as the [[Prince of Yan]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|燕|王}}}}) in May 1370,&lt;ref name="4chan"&gt;Chan Hok-lam. "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cbDee_nEkYcC&amp;pg=PA75 Legitimating Usurpation: Historical Revisions under the Ming Yongle Emperor (r. 1402{{ndash}}1424)]". ''The Legitimation of New Orders: Case Studies in World History''. Chinese University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|9789629962395}}. Accessed 12 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; with the capital of his princedom at Beiping (modern [[Beijing]]). Amid the continuing struggle against the [[Mongols]] of the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]], Zhu Di consolidated his own power and eliminated rivals such as the general [[Lan Yu (general)|Lan Yu]]. He initially accepted his father's appointment of his eldest brother [[Zhu Biao]] and then his nephew [[Jianwen Emperor|Zhu Yunwen]] as [[Taizi|crown prince]], but when Zhu Yunwen ascended the throne as the Jianwen Emperor and began executing and demoting his powerful uncles, Zhu Di found pretext for rising in rebellion against his nephew.&lt;ref name="4chan"/&gt; Assisted in large part by [[eunuch]]s mistreated by the Hongwu and Jianwen Emperors, who both favored the Confucian [[scholar-bureaucrat]]s,&lt;ref name="EunuchPower!"&gt;Crawford, Robert B. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4527509 Eunuch Power in the Ming Dynasty]". ''T'oung Pao'', 2d Series, Vol. 49, Livr. 3 (1961), pp. 115-148. Accessed 9 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhu Di survived the initial attacks on his princedom and drove south to launch the [[Jingnan Campaign]] against the Jianwen Emperor in [[Nanjing]]. In 1402, he successfully overthrew his nephew and occupied the imperial capital, [[Nanjing]], after which he was proclaimed Emperor and adopted the [[Chinese era name|era name]] '''Yongle''', which means "perpetual happiness".

Eager to establish his own legitimacy, Zhu Di voided the Jianwen Emperor's reign and established a wide-ranging effort to destroy or falsify records concerning his childhood and rebellion.&lt;ref name="4chan"/&gt; This included a massive purge of the Confucian scholars in Nanjing&lt;ref name="4chan"/&gt; and grants of extraordinary extralegal authority to the eunuch secret police.&lt;ref name="EunuchPower!"/&gt; One favorite was [[Zheng He]], who employed his authority to launch major [[treasure voyages|voyages of exploration]] into the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. The difficulties in Nanjing also led the Yongle Emperor to re-establish Beiping (present-day [[Beijing]]) as the new imperial capital. He repaired and reopened the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] and, between 1406 and 1420, directed the construction of the [[Forbidden City]]. He was also responsible for the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]], considered one of the wonders of the world before its destruction by the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping rebels]] in 1856. As part of his continuing attempt to control the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats, the Yongle Emperor also greatly expanded the [[Keju|imperial examination system]] in place of his father's use of personal recommendation and appointment. These scholars completed the monumental ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]'' during his reign.

The Yongle Emperor died while personally leading a military campaign against the Mongols. He was buried in the [[Ming Changling Mausoleum|Changling Tomb]], the central and largest mausoleum of the [[Ming Dynasty Tombs]] located north of Beijing.

==Youth==
The Yongle Emperor was born Zhu Di ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|朱|棣}}}}) on 2 May 1360, the fourth son of the new leader of the central [[Red Turban Rebellion|Red Turbans]], [[Zhu Yuanzhang]]. Zhu Yuanzhang would later rise to become the [[Hongwu Emperor]], the first emperor of the Ming dynasty. According to surviving Ming historical records, Zhu Di's mother was the Hongwu Emperor's primary consort, [[Empress Ma (Hongwu)|Empress Ma]], the view Zhu Di himself maintained. Some contemporaries maintained, however, that Zhu Di's mother was a non-[[Han Chinese]] concubine of his father's,&lt;ref name="4chan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levathes, Louise. ''When China Ruled The Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne 1405–1433'', p. 59. Oxford Univ. Press (New York), 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the official records were changed during his reign to list him as a son of the Empress Ma in order to sanction his succession on the "death" of the [[Jianwen Emperor]].

The Mongols circulated a legend found in [[Altan Tobchi]] that the Yongle Emperor was the son of a Mongol empress who was pregnant with a Mongol child and captured after the Ming took over Beijing, and that she prayed that her pregnancy would be extended miraculously so the Hongwu Emperor would not suspect the child wasn't his, and that her pregnancy was extended by a miracle to 13 months instead of 9 months. This legend is disproven by the fact that it was only in 1368 when Beijing was captured and entered by the Hongwu Emperor (Zhu Yuanzhang) while the May 2, 1360 was the birthdate of the Yongle Emperor (Zhu Di) which was much earlier than the capture of Beijing.&lt;ref name="Levathes1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Levathes|title=When China Ruled the Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne 1405-1433|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;id=QgUoAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=May+1360+beijing+1368&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=May+1360+beijing+1368|year=1994|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-70158-1|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levathes2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Levathes|title=When China Ruled the Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne, 1405–1433|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0gwBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT170&amp;dq=born+May+2+1360+beijing+1368&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwid9Z7jhvTaAhVCMd8KHcGoB9kQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=born%20May%202%201360%20beijing%201368&amp;f=false|date=2 December 2014|publisher=Open Road Distribution|isbn=978-1-5040-0736-8|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhu Di grew up as a prince in a loving, caring environment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} His father supplied nothing but the best education{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and, trusting them alone, reestablished the old feudal principalities for his many sons. Zhu Di was created [[Prince of Yan]], a location important for being both the [[Khanbaliq|former capital]] of the Mongol-led [[Yuan dynasty]] and the frontline of battle against [[Northern Yuan dynasty]], a successor state to the Yuan dynasty. When Zhu Di moved to [[Beiping]], he found a city that had been devastated by famine and disease, but he worked with his father's general [[Xu Da]] {{ndash}} who was also his own father-in-law {{ndash}} to continue the pacification of the region. The official Ming histories portray a Zhu Di who impressed his father with his energy, daring, and leadership amid numerous successes; nonetheless, the Ming dynasty suffered numerous reverses during his tenure and the great victory at [[Buir Lake]] was won not by Zhu Di but by his brother's partisan [[Lan Yu (general)|Lan Yu]]. Similarly, when the Hongwu Emperor sent large forces to the north, they were not placed under Zhu Di's command.

==Rise to power==

[[File:Yangshan Quarry - Monument Base - P1060909.JPG|thumb|right|The abandoned base for a [[Yangshan Quarry|giant stele]] that the Yongle Emperor ordered to be made for his father in 1405]]
The [[Hongwu Emperor]] was long-lived and survived his first heir, [[Zhu Biao]], the Crown Prince. He worried about his succession and issued a series of dynastic instructions for his family, the ''[[Huang Ming Zu Xun]]''. These instructions made it clear that the rule would pass only to children from the emperor's primary consort, excluding the Prince of Yan in favour of Zhu Yunwen, Zhu Biao's son.&lt;ref name="4chan"/&gt; When the Hongwu Emperor died on 24 June 1398, Zhu Yunwen succeeded his grandfather as the [[Jianwen Emperor]]. In direct violation of the dynastic instructions, the Prince of Yan attempted to mourn his father in Nanjing, bringing a large armed guard with him. The imperial army was able to block him at [[Huai'an]] and, given that three of his sons were serving as hostages in the capital, the prince withdrew in disgrace.&lt;ref name="4chan"/&gt;

The Jianwen Emperor's harsh campaign against his weaker uncles (dubbed {{lang|zh|削蕃}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Weakening the Marcher Lords") made accommodation much more difficult, however: Zhu Di's full brother, [[Zhu Su]] (朱橚), was arrested and exiled to Yunnan; the Prince of Dai [[Zhu Gui (Ming dynasty)|Zhu Gui]] (朱桂) was reduced to a commoner; the Prince of Xiang [[Zhu Bai]] (朱柏) committed suicide under duress; the Princes of Qi and Min, [[Zhu Fu (Ming dynasty)|Zhu Fu]] (朱榑) and [[Zhu Bian]] (朱楩) respectively, were demoted all within the later half of 1398 and the first half of 1399. Faced with certain hostility, Zhu Di pretended to fall ill and then "went mad" for a number of months before achieving his aim of freeing his sons from captivity to visit him in the north in June 1399. On 5 August, Zhu Di declared that the Jianwen Emperor had fallen victim to "evil counselors" ({{lang|zh|奸臣}}) and that the Hongwu Emperor's dynastic instructions obliged him to rise in arms to remove them, a conflict known as the [[Jingnan Campaign]].&lt;ref name="4chan"/&gt;

[[File:Ming-Emperor3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Yongle Emperor observing court eunuchs playing [[cuju]], an ancient Chinese game similar to [[soccer]].]]
In the first year, Zhu Di survived the initial assaults by superior forces under [[Geng Bingwen]] (耿炳文) and [[Li Jinglong]] (李景龍) thanks to superior tactics and capable Mongol auxiliaries. He also issued numerous justifications for his rebellion, including questionable claims to have been the son of Empress Ma and bold-faced lies that his father had attempted to name him as the rightful heir, only to be thwarted by bureaucrats scheming to empower Zhu Biao's son. Whether because of this propaganda or for personal motives, Zhu Di began to receive a steady stream of turncoat eunuchs and generals who provided him with invaluable intelligence allowing a hit-and-run campaign against the imperial supply depots along the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]]. By 1402, he knew enough to be able to avoid the main hosts of the imperial army while sacking [[Xuzhou]], [[Suzhou]], and [[Yangzhou]]. The betrayal of [[Chen Xuan]] gave him the imperial army's Yangtze River fleet; the betrayal of Li Jinglong and the prince's half-brother [[Zhu Hui]] (朱橞) opened the gates of Nanjing on 13 July. Amid the disorder, the imperial palace quickly caught fire: Zhu Di enabled his own succession by claiming three bodies {{ndash}} charred beyond recognition {{ndash}} as the Jianwen emperor, his consort, and their son but rumours circulated for decades that the Jianwen Emperor had escaped in disguise as a Buddhist monk.&lt;ref name="4chan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lü Bi ({{lang|zh|吕毖}}). ''A Short History of the Ming Dynasty'' ({{lang|zh|《明朝小史》}}), Vol. 3. {{zh-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gu Yingtai ({{lang|zh|谷應泰}}). ''Major Events in Ming History'' ({{lang|zh|《明史紀事本末》}}), Vol. 16. {{zh-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having captured the capital, Zhu Di now left aside his former arguments about rescuing his nephew from evil counsel and voided the Jianwen Emperor's entire reign, taking 1402 as the 35th year of the Hongwu era.&lt;ref name="4chan"/&gt; His own brother Zhu Biao, whom the Jianwen Emperor had posthumously elevated to emperor, was now posthumously demoted; Zhu Biao's surviving two sons were demoted to commoners and placed under house arrest; and the Jianwen Emperor's surviving younger son was imprisoned and hidden for the next 55 years. After a brief show of humility where he repeatedly refused offers to take the throne, Zhu Di accepted and proclaimed that the next year would be the first year of the Yongle era. On 17 July 1402, after a brief visit to his father's tomb, Zhu Di was crowned{{Clarify|date=October 2012}} emperor of the Ming Empire at the age of 42. He would spend most of his early years suppressing rumours and outlaws.

==Becoming the emperor==
With many [[scholar-bureaucrat]]s in Nanjing refusing to recognise the legitimacy of his claim to the throne, the Yongle Emperor began a thorough purge of them and their families, including women and children. Other supporters of the Jianwen Emperor's regime were extirpated throughout the country, while a reign of terror was seen due to eunuchs settling scores with the two prior administrations.&lt;ref name="EunuchPower!"/&gt;

[[File:Yongle Emperor.png|thumb|Bronze statue of the Yongle Emperor. This is a replica of the original stone statue that was destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]]]]
Chinese law had long allowed for the [[nine familial exterminations|execution of families]] along with principals: The ''[[Classic of History]]'' records insubordinate officers being threatened with it as far back as the [[Shang dynasty]]. The [[Hongwu Emperor]] had fully restored the practice, punishing rebels and traitors with [[slow slicing|death by a thousand cuts]] as well as the death of their grandparents, parents, uncles and aunts, siblings by birth or [[sworn brothers|by bond]], children, nephews and nieces, grandchildren, and all cohabitants of whatever family,&lt;ref&gt;Chinamonitor.org. "[http://www.chinamonitor.org/article/kuxing/mingkx.htm Examination of China's Death Penalty: Torture from the Time of the Ming"] ({{lang|zh|《中国死刑观察--明初酷刑》}}). {{zh-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ni Zhengmao ({{lang|zh|倪正茂}}). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ets_fwnbLBYC&amp;pg=PA229 An Exploration of Comparative Law]'' ({{lang|zh|比较法学探析}}). China Legal Publishing ({{lang|zh|中国法制出版社}}), 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; although children were sometimes spared and women were sometimes permitted to choose slavery instead. Four of the purged scholars became known as the [[Four Martyrs]], the most famous of whom was [[Fang Xiaoru]], the former tutor to the Jianwen Emperor: threatened with execution of all nine degrees of his kinship, he fatuously replied "Never mind nine! Go with ten!" and {{ndash}} alone in Chinese history {{ndash}} he was sentenced to execution of 10 degrees of kinship: along with his entire family, every former student or peer of Fang Xiaoru that the Yongle Emperor's agents could find was also killed. It was said that as he died, cut in half at the waist, Fang used his own blood to write the character {{lang|zh|篡}} ("usurper") on the floor and that 872 other people were executed in the ordeal.

The Yongle Emperor followed traditional rituals closely and held many popular beliefs. He did not overindulge in the luxuries of palace life, but still used [[Buddhism]] and Buddhist festivals to help calm civil unrest. He stopped the warring between the various Chinese tribes and reorganised the provinces to best provide peace within the Ming Empire. The Yongle Emperor was said to be an "ardent Buddhist" by Ernst Faber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEYPAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=ardent+buddhist#v=snippet&amp;q=ardent%20buddhist%20reaching&amp;f=false|title=Chronological handbook of the history of China: a manuscript left by the late Rev. Ernst Faber|author=Ernst Faber|editor=|year=1902|publisher=Pub. by the General Evangelical Protestant missionary society of Germany|edition=|location=|page=196|accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the stress and overwhelming amount of thinking involved in running a post-rebellion empire, the Yongle Emperor searched for scholars to serve in his government. He had many of the best scholars chosen as candidates and took great care in choosing them, even creating terms by which he hired people. He was also concerned about the degeneration of Buddhism in China.

==Reign==
[[File:Ming divisions.png|thumb|Ming dynasty in Yongle's reign (as of 1409)]]

===Relations with Tibet===
Tibetan Buddhism was patronised by Yongle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/documents/readings/robinson_culture_courtiers_ch.8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sav.sk/journals/uploads/040214374_Slobodn%C3%ADk.pdf p 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1403, the Yongle Emperor [[Tibet during the Ming Dynasty#Religious significance|sent messages, gifts, and envoys to Tibet]] inviting [[Deshin Shekpa]], the fifth [[Gyalwa Karmapa]] of the [[Kagyu]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], to visit the imperial capital – apparently after having a vision of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Avalokitesvara]]. After a long journey, Deshin Shekpa arrived in [[Nanjing]] on 10 April 1407 riding on an elephant towards the imperial palace, where tens of thousands of monks greeted him.

Deshin Shekpa convinced the Yongle Emperor that there were different religions for different people, which does not mean that one is better than the others. The Karmapa was very well received during his visit and a number of miraculous occurrences were reported. He also performed ceremonies for the imperial family. The emperor presented him with 700 measures of silver objects and bestowed the title of 'Precious Religious King, Great Loving One of the West, Mighty Buddha of Peace'.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the religious matter, the Yongle Emperor wished to establish an alliance with the Karmapa similar to the one the 13th- and 14th-century [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] khans had established with the [[Sakyapa]].&lt;ref&gt;Sperling, 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; He apparently offered to send armies to unify Tibet under the Karmapa but Deshin Shekpa demurred, as parts of Tibet were still firmly controlled by partisans of the former Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deshin Shekpa left Nanjing on 17 May 1408.&lt;ref&gt;Sperling, 284.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1410, he returned to [[Tsurphu Monastery|Tsurphu]] where he had his monastery rebuilt following severe damage from an earthquake.

===Selecting an heir===
When it was time for him to choose an heir, the Yongle Emperor wanted to choose his second son, [[Zhu Gaoxu]]. Zhu Gaoxu had an athletic-warrior personality which contrasted sharply with his elder brother's intellectual and humanitarian nature. Despite much counsel from his advisers, the Yongle Emperor chose his older son, Zhu Gaozhi (the future [[Hongxi Emperor]]), as his heir apparent mainly due to advice from [[Xie Jin (mandarin)|Xie Jin]]. As a result, Zhu Gaoxu became infuriated and refused to give up jockeying for his father's favour and refusing to move to [[Yunnan|Yunnan Province]], where his princedom was located. He even went so far as to undermine Xie Jin's counsel and eventually killed him.

===National economy and construction projects===
After the Yongle Emperor's overthrow of the [[Jianwen Emperor]], China's countryside was devastated. The fragile new economy had to deal with low production and depopulation. The Yongle Emperor laid out a long and extensive plan to strengthen and stabilise the new economy, but first he had to silence dissension. He created an elaborate system of censors to remove corrupt officials from office that spread such rumors. The emperor dispatched some of his most trusted officers to reveal or destroy secret societies, bandits, and loyalists to his other relatives. To strengthen the economy, he fought population decline by reclaiming land, using the most he could from the existing labour force, and maximising textile and agricultural production.

The Yongle Emperor also worked to reclaim production rich regions such as the Lower [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze Delta]] and called for a massive reconstruction of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]]. During his reign, the Grand Canal was almost completely rebuilt and was eventually moving imported goods from all over the world. The Yongle Emperor's short-term goal was to revitalise northern urban centres, especially his new capital at [[Beijing]]. Before the Grand Canal was rebuilt, grain was transferred to Beijing in two ways; one route was simply via the [[East China Sea]], from the port of [[Liujiagang]] (near [[Suzhou]]); the other was a far more laborious process of transferring the grain from large to small shallow barges (after passing the [[Huai River]] and having to cross southwestern [[Shandong]]), then transferred back to large river barges on the [[Yellow River]] before finally reaching Beijing.&lt;ref name="brook 46 47"&gt;Brook, 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; With the necessary tribute grain shipments of four million ''shi'' (one ''shi'' equal to 107 [[liter]]s) to the north each year, both processes became incredibly inefficient.&lt;ref name="brook 46 47"/&gt; It was a magistrate of [[Jining, Shandong]] who sent a memorandum to the Yongle Emperor protesting the current method of grain shipment, a request that the emperor ultimately granted.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yongle Emperor ambitiously planned to move his capital to Beijing. According to a popular legend, the capital was moved when the emperor's advisers brought the emperor to the hills surrounding Nanjing and pointed out the emperor's palace showing the vulnerability of the palace to artillery attack.

The emperor planned to build a massive network of structures in Beijing in which government offices, officials, and the imperial family resided. After a painfully long construction time (1407–1420), the [[Forbidden City]] was finally completed and became the imperial capital for the next 500 years.

The Yongle Emperor finalised the architectural ensemble of his father's [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]] in Nanjing by erecting a monumental "Square Pavilion" (Sifangcheng) with an eight-metre-tall [[bixi (tortoise)|tortoise-borne]] stele, extolling the merits and virtues of the Hongwu Emperor. In fact, the Yongle Emperor's original idea for the memorial was to erect an unprecedented stele 73 metres tall. However, due to the impossibility of moving or erecting the giant parts of that monuments, they have been left unfinished in [[Yangshan Quarry]], where they remain to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=南京明清建筑 (Ming and Qing architecture of Nanjing)|last=Yang|first=Xinhua (杨新华)|last2= Lu|first2= Haiming (卢海鸣)|publisher=南京大学出版社 (Nanjing University Press)|year=2001|isbn=7-305-03669-2|pages=595–599, 616–617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the Hongwu Emperor may have meant for his descendants to be buried near his own Xiaoling Mausoleum (this was how the Hongwu Emperor's heir apparent, [[Zhu Biao]] was buried), the Yongle Emperor's relocation of the capital to Beijing necessitated the creation of a new imperial burial ground. On the advice of [[fengshui]] experts, the Yongle Emperor chose a site north of Beijing, where he and his successors were to be buried. Over the next two centuries, thirteen emperors in total were laid to rest in the [[Ming Dynasty Tombs]].

===Religion and philosophy===
The Yongle Emperor sponsored and created many cultural traditions. He promoted [[Confucianism]] and kept traditional ritual ceremonies with a rich cultural theme. His respect for classical culture was apparent. He commissioned his [[Grand Secretary]], [[Xie Jin (mandarin)|Xie Jin]], to write a compilation of every subject and every known book of the Chinese. The massive project's goal was to preserve Chinese culture and literature in writing. The initial copy took 17 months to transcribe and another copy was transcribed in 1557. The book, named the ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]'', is still considered one of the most marvellous human achievements in history, despite it being gradually lost by time.

The Yongle Emperor's tolerance of Chinese ideas that did not agree with his own philosophies was well known. He treated [[Daoism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Buddhism]] equally (though he favoured Confucianism). Strict Confucianists considered him hypocritical, but his even-handed approach helped him win the support of the people and unify China. His love for [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] sparked a sincere hatred for Mongol culture. He considered it rotten and forbade the use of popular [[Mongolian names|Mongol names]], habits, language, and clothing. Great lengths were taken by the Yongle Emperor to eradicate Mongol culture from China.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The Yongle Emperor called for the construction and repair of [[Islam]]ic mosques during his reign. Two mosques were built by him, one in [[Nanjing]] and the other in [[Xi'an]] and they still stand today.

===Military campaigns===

====Wars against the Mongols====
{{main|Yongle Emperor's campaigns against the Mongols}}
[[File:Yongle emperor.png|thumb|250px|Ming China under the Yongle Emperor's reign (1424)]]
Mongol invaders were still causing many problems for the Ming Empire. The Yongle Emperor prepared to eliminate this threat. He mounted [[Yongle Emperor's campaigns against the Mongols|five military expeditions into the Mongol steppes]] and crushed the remnants of the [[Yuan dynasty]] that had fled north after being defeated by the Hongwu Emperor. He repaired the northern defences and forged buffer alliances to keep the Mongols at bay in order to build an army. His strategy was to force the Mongols into economic dependence on the Chinese and to launch periodic initiatives into Mongolia to cripple their offensive power. He attempted to compel Mongolia to become a Chinese tributary, with all the tribes submitting and proclaiming themselves vassals of the Ming Empire, and wanted to contain and isolate the Mongols. Through fighting, the Yongle Emperor learned to appreciate the importance of cavalry in battle and eventually began spending much of his resources to keep horses in good supply. The emperor spent his entire life fighting the Mongols. Failures and successes came and went, but it should be noted that after the emperor's second personal campaign against the Mongols, the Ming Empire was at peace for over seven years.

[[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Tang Taizong]] was cited by Yongle as his model for being familiar with both China and the steppe people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Robinson|first=David M.|title=Delimiting the Realm under the Ming Dynasty|url=http://mongol.huji.ac.il/sites/default/files/Robinson_Delimiting%20the%20Realm%20under%20the%20Ming%20Dynasty.pdf|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Heavenly Qaghan" Tang Emperor Taizong was imitated by Yongle as was the Tang's multi-ethnic nature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/journal/articles/v60p299.pdf p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conquest of Vietnam====
{{main|Ming–Hồ War|Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam}}
[[Vietnam]] was a significant source of difficulties during the Yongle Emperor's reign. In 1406, the emperor responded to several formal petitions from members of the [[Trần dynasty]], however on arrival to Vietnam, both the Trần prince and the accompanying Chinese ambassador were ambushed and killed. In response to this insult, the Yongle Emperor sent two armies led by [[Zhang Fu]] and [[Mu Sheng]] [[Ming–Hồ War|to conquer Vietnam]]. As the Ho royal family were all executed,&lt;ref name=Maspero&gt;Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., {{ISBN|9747534991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|112–113}} Vietnam was integrated as a province of China, just as it had been up until 939. With the Ho monarch defeated in 1407, the Chinese began a serious and sustained effort to [[sinicise]] the population. All classical Vietnamese printing blocks, books and materials were burned. For this reason almost no vernacular [[chữ nôm]] texts survive from before the Ming invasion. Various ancient sites such as pagoda Bao Minh were looted and destroyed.  On 2 December 1407, the Yongle Emperor gave orders to Zhang Fu that innocent Vietnamese were not to be harmed, ordering family members of rebels to be spared such as young males if they themselves were not involved in rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |others=Geoff Wade, translator |last2= |first2= |date= |title= Southeast Asia in the Ming Shi-lu: an open access resource |url=http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/entry/1078?hl=%22Jiao-zhi%22 |location=Singapore|publisher=Asia Research Institute and the Singapore E-Press, National University of Singapore |volume= |issue= |page=1014 |doi= |accessdate=July 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to colonize Vietnam into a Chinese province was met by fierce resistance, first from the [[Tran dynasty|Trần]] aristocrats who fought the [[Later Trần dynasty|Later Trần rebellion]] in the Red River Delta, and then from the frontier population among the Vietnamese and [[Muong people]] in mountainous Thanh Hoa and Nghe An provinces. In early 1418, [[Lê Lợi]], who founded the [[Lê dynasty]], started a major rebellion against Ming rule. By the time the Yongle Emperor died in 1424, the Vietnamese rebels under Lê Lợi's leadership had captured nearly the entire province. By 1427, the [[Xuande Emperor]] gave up the effort started by his grandfather and formally acknowledged Vietnam's independence on condition they accept vassal status.

===Diplomatic missions and exploration of the world===
{{main|Treasure voyages}}
[[File:Tribute Giraffe with Attendant.jpg|thumb|200px|An African [[giraffe]], originally from [[Malindi]], being presented to the Yongle Emperor by the [[Bengal]]i ruler in 1414, and taken to be an auspicious ''[[qilin]]''.&lt;ref name=duy&gt;{{Citation|first=J.J.L. |last=Duyvendak |jstor=4527170 |title=The True Dates of the Chinese Maritime Expeditions in the Early Fifteenth Century The True Dates of the Chinese Maritime Expeditions in the Early Fifteenth Century|journal=T'oung Pao, Second Series| volume= 34|issue= 5|year=1939|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As part of his desire to expand Chinese influence throughout the known world, the Yongle Emperor sponsored the massive and long term [[treasure voyages]] led by admiral [[Zheng He]]. While Chinese ships continued travelling to Japan, [[Ryukyu]], and many locations in Southeast Asia before and after the Yongle Emperor's reign, Zheng He's expeditions were China's only major sea-going explorations of the world (although the Chinese may have been sailing to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], and [[Egypt]] since the [[Tang dynasty]]&lt;ref&gt;Based on descriptions of the coast from 860. {{citation|author1=Ronan, Colin|author2=Needham, Joseph|title=The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China|page=133|year=1986|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or earlier). The first expedition was launched in 1405 (18 years before [[Henry the Navigator]] began Portugal's [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]]). The expeditions were under the command of Zheng He and his associates ([[Wang Jinghong]], [[Hong Bao]], etc.). Seven expeditions were launched between 1405 and 1433, reaching major trade centres of Asia (as far as [[Tondeswaram temple|Tenavarai]] ([[Dondra Head]]), [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] and [[Aden]]) and northeastern Africa ([[Malindi]]). [[Chinese treasure ship|Some of the ships]] used were apparently the largest sail-powered wooden ships in human history.&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic'', May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese expeditions were a remarkable technical and logistical achievement. The Yongle Emperor's successors, the [[Hongxi Emperor|Hongxi]] and [[Xuande Emperor|Xuande]] Emperors, felt that the costly expeditions were harmful to the Ming Empire. The Hongxi Emperor ended further expeditions and the descendants of the Xuande Emperor suppressed much of the information about Zheng He's treasure voyages.

On 30 January 1406, the Yongle Emperor expressed horror when the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuans]] castrated some of their own children to become eunuchs to serve in the Ming imperial palace. The emperor said that the boys who were castrated were innocent and did not deserve castration, and he returned the boys to Ryukyu and instructed them not to send eunuchs again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wade  |first=Geoff |date=July 1, 2007 |title= Ryukyu in the Ming Reign Annals 1380s-1580s |url= http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/wps/wps07_093.pdf |ssrn= 1317152 |archivedate= September 5, 2009 |journal= |publisher= Asia Research Institute National University of Singapore |volume= |series= Working Paper Series |issue= 93 |page= 75 |doi= |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1411, a smaller fleet, built in [[Jilin City|Jilin]] and commanded by another eunuch [[Yishiha]], who was a [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]], sailed down the [[Sungari]] and [[Amur River]]s. The expedition established a [[Nurgan Regional Military Commission]] in the region,  headquartered at the place the Chinese called Telin (特林; now the village of [[Tyr, Russia]]). The local [[Nivkh people|Nivkh]] or Tungusic chiefs were granted ranks in the imperial administration. Yishiha's expeditions returned to the lower Amur several more times during the reigns of the Yongle and [[Xuande Emperor|Xuande]] Emperors, the last one visiting the region in the 1430s.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;L.

In 1375, the Ming dynasty established the Liaodong Regional Military Commission at Liaoyang, using twenty-five guards (each guard consisted of roughly 5,600 soldiers) to control Southern Manchuria. In 1409, six years after the Yongle Emperor ascended the throne, he launched three campaigns to shore up Ming influence in the lower Amur River valley. The upshot was the establishment of the Nuerkan Regional Military Commission with several battalions (1,120 soldiers theoretically made up a battalion) deployed along the Songari, Ussuri, Khor, Urmi, Muling and Nen Rivers. The Nuerkan Commission, which parallelled that of the Liaodong Commission, was a special frontier administrations; therefore the Ming government permitted its commanding officers to transmit their offices to their sons and grandsons without any dimunition in rank. In the meantime, The Ming court periodically sent special envoys and inspectors to the region, making sure that the chiefs of various tribes remained loyal to the Ming emperor. But the one enboy who was most active and played the most significant role in the region was the eunuch Yishiha. |location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=0-7914-2687-4|page=129|pages=|title=The eunuchs in the Ming dynasty|edition=illustrated|author=Shih-shan Henry Tsai|accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Timur]], who intended to invade China, relations between the Ming Empire and [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shakhrukh]]'s state in Persia and Transoxania state considerably improved, and the states exchanged large official delegations on a number of occasions. Both the Ming Empire's envoy to [[Samarkand]] and [[Herat]], [[Chen Cheng (Ming dynasty)|Chen Cheng]], and his counterpart, [[Ghiyasu'd-Din Naqqah]], recorded detailed accounts of their visits to each other's states.

One of the Yongle Emperor's consorts was a [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] princess, which resulted in many of the eunuchs serving him being of Jurchen origin, notably [[Yishiha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SGAbAAAAYAAJ|title=Chinese eunuchs: the structure of intimate politics|author=Taisuke Mitamura|year=1970|publisher=C.E.

The Ming shi provides no background information on this Manchurian castrato except that Yishiha worked under two powerful early Ming eunuchs, Wang Zhen, and Cao Jixiang. It is also likely that Yishiha gained prominence by enduring the hard knocks of court politics and serving imperial concubines of Manchurian origin, as the Yongle Emperor kept Jurchen women in his harem. At any rate, in the spring of 1411, the Yongle Emperor commissioned Yishiha to vie for the heart and soul of the peoples in Northern Manchuria and Eastern Siberia. Yishiha led a party of more than 1,000 officers and soldiers who boarded twenty-five ships and sailed along the Amur River for several days before reaching the Nuerkan Command post. Nuerkan was located on the east bank of the Amur River, approximately 300 li from the river's entrance and 250 li form the present-day Russian town of Nikolayevka. Yishiha's immediate assignment was to confer titles on tribal chiefs, giving them seals and uniforms. He also actively sought new recruits to fill out the official ranks for the Regional Commission.17|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=0-7914-2687-4|page=129|title=The eunuchs in the Ming dynasty|edition=illustrated|author=Shih-shan Henry Tsai|accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yongle Emperor exchanged ambassadors with [[Shahrukh Mirza]], sending [[Chen Cheng (Ming dynasty)|Chen Cheng]] to Samarkand and Herat, and Shahrukh sent [[Ghiyāth al-dīn Naqqāsh]] to Beijing.

==Death==
On 1 April 1424, the Yongle Emperor launched a large campaign into the [[Gobi Desert]] to chase an army of fleeing [[Oirats]]. Frustrated at his inability to catch up with his swift opponents, Yongle fell into a deep depression and then into illness, possibly owing to a series of minor strokes.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} On 12 August 1424, the Yongle Emperor died.  He was entombed in Changling (長陵), a location northwest of Beijing.

==Legacy==
[[File:Nanking Erlach.jpg|thumb|The Porcelain Tower]]
Many{{who|date=March 2018}} have seen the Yongle Emperor as in a lifelong pursuit of power, prestige, and glory. He respected and worked hard to preserve [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] by designing monuments such as the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]], while undermining and expelling from Chinese society people from foreign cultures. He deeply admired and wished to save his father's accomplishments{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} and spent a lot of time proving his claim to the throne. His reign was a mixed blessing for the Chinese populace. The Yongle Emperor's economic, educational, and military reforms provided unprecedented benefits for the people{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}, but his [[despotism|despotic]] style of government set up a spy agency. Despite these negatives, he is considered{{who|date=March 2018}} an architect and keeper of Chinese culture, history, and statecraft and an influential ruler in Chinese history.

He is remembered very much for his cruelty, just like his father. He killed most of the Jianwen Emperor's palace servants, tortured many of his nephew's loyalists to death, killed or by other means badly treated their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bo Yang]], ''中國人史綱'', ch.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;宋端儀, ''立齋閑錄'', vol.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;陸人龍, ''型世言'', ch.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zt.chinashishi.net/gb/content/2009-10/08/content_84694_2.htm 建文帝出亡宁德之谜揭秘八：建文帝出亡闽东金邶寺]&lt;/ref&gt; His successor freed most of the survivors.
