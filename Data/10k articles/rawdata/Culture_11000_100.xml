The terms '''A-side''' and '''B-side''' refer to the two sides of 78, 45, and 33 1/3 rpm [[phonograph record]]s, or [[Compact cassette|cassettes]], whether [[single (music)|singles]], [[extended play]]s (EPs), or [[long-playing]] (LP) records. The A-side usually featured the recording that the artist, record producer, or the record company intended to receive the initial promotional effort and then receive radio airplay, hopefully, to become a [[hit record|"hit" record]]. The B-side (or "flip-side") is a secondary recording that has a history of its own: some artists released B-sides that were considered as strong as the A-side and became hits in their own right. Others took the opposite approach: producer [[Phil Spector]] was in the habit of filling B-sides with on-the-spot instrumentals that no one would confuse with the A-side. With this practice, Spector was assured that airplay was focused on the side he wanted to be the hit side.

Music recordings have moved away from records onto other formats such as [[Compact Disc single|CDs]] and [[music download|digital downloads]], which do not have "sides", but the terms are still used to describe the type of content, with B-side sometimes standing for "bonus" track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=B-Sides, Undercurrents and Overtones: Peripheries to Popular in Music, 1960 to the Present|first=Professor George|last=Plasketes|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|date=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first sound recordings at the end of the 19th century were made on [[phonograph cylinder|cylinder records]], which had a single round surface capable of holding approximately two minutes of sound. Early shellac [[disc record]]s records only had recordings on one side of the disc, with a similar capacity (both media could hold between three and four minutes by 1910). Double-sided recordings, with one selection on each side, were introduced in Europe by [[Columbia Records]] in 1908, and by 1910 most record labels had adopted the format in both Europe and the United States; the ability to effectively double the amount of sound on the disc was one major factor in its rising to dominance over the cylinder record which was obsolete by 1912.

There were no [[record charts]] until the 1930s, and radio stations (by and large) did not play recorded music until the 1950s (when [[top 40]] radio overtook [[Old-time radio#Legacy|full-service network radio]]). In this time, A-sides and B-sides existed, but neither side was considered more important; the "side" did not convey anything about the content of the record.

In June 1948, Columbia Records introduced the modern  33 1/3 rpm [[LP album|long-playing (LP)]] microgroove [[gramophone record|vinyl]] record for commercial sales, and its rival [[RCA Victor]], responded the next year with the seven-inch 45 rpm vinylite record, which would quickly replace the 78 for single record releases. The term [[single (music)|"single"]] came into popular use with the advent of vinyl records in the early 1950s. At first, most record labels would randomly assign which song would be an A-side and which would be a B-side. (All records have specific identifiers for each side in addition to the catalog number for the record itself; the "A" side would typically be assigned a sequentially lower number.) Under this random system, many artists had so-called "double-sided hits", where both songs on a record made one of the national sales charts (in ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'', or other magazines), or would be featured on [[jukebox]]es in public places.

As time wore on, however, the convention for assigning songs to sides of the record changed. By the early sixties, the song on the A-side was the song that the record company wanted radio stations to play, as 45 rpm single records (or '45s') dominated the market in terms of cash sales. It was not until 1968, for instance, that the total production of albums on a unit basis finally surpassed that of singles in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1960s stereo versions of pop and rock songs began to regularly appear on 45s.  The majority of the 45s were played on AM radio stations, which were not equipped for stereo broadcast at the time, so stereo was not a priority.  However, the FM rock stations did not like to play monaural content, so the record companies adopted a protocol for DJ versions with the mono version of the song on one side, and stereo version of the same song on the other.

By the early 1970s, double-sided hits had become rare. Album sales had increased, and B-sides had become the side of the record where non-album, non-radio-friendly, instrumental versions or simply inferior recordings were placed. In order to further ensure that radio stations played the side that the record companies had chosen, it was common for the promotional copies (DJ version) of a single to have the "plug side" on both sides of the disc.

With the decline of 45 rpm vinyl records, after the introduction of [[compact audio cassette|cassette]] and compact disc singles in the late 1980s, the A-side/B-side differentiation became much less meaningful. At first, cassette singles would often have one song on each side of the cassette, matching the arrangement of vinyl records, but eventually, cassette [[maxi-single]]s, containing more than two songs, became more popular. Cassette singles were phased out beginning in the late 1990s, and the A-side/B-side dichotomy became virtually extinct, as the remaining dominant medium, the compact disc, lacked an equivalent physical distinction. However, the term "B-side" is still used to refer to the "[[bonus track|bonus]]" tracks or "coupling" tracks on a CD single.

With the advent of downloading music via the Internet, sales of CD singles and other physical media have declined, and the term "B-side" is now less commonly used. Songs that were not part of an artist's collection of albums are made available through the same downloadable catalogs as tracks from their albums, and are usually referred to as "unreleased", "bonus", "non-album", "rare", "outtakes" or "exclusive" tracks, the latter in the case of a song being available solely from a certain provider of music.

==Significance==
B-side songs may be released on the same record as a single to provide extra "value for money". There are several types of material commonly released in this way, including a different version (e.g., instrumental, [[a cappella]], [[live album|live]], [[acoustic instrument|acoustic]], [[remix]]ed version or in another language), or, in a [[Concept album|concept record]], a song that does not fit into the story line.{{citation needed|using a song on the B-side because it doesn't fit into the storyline of a concept LP is conjecture. Examples and/or references are needed to back up this assertion. date=May 2016|date=May 2016}}

Additionally, it was common in the 1960s and 1970s for longer songs, especially by soul, funk, and R&amp;B acts, to be broken into two parts for single release. Examples of this include [[Ray Charles]]'s "[[What'd I Say]]", [[the Isley Brothers]]' "[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]", and a number of records by [[James Brown]], including "[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]" and "[[Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud]]". Typically, "part one" would be the chart hit, while "part two" would be a continuation of the same performance. A notable example of a non-R&amp;B hit with two parts was the single release of [[Don McLean]]'s "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]". With the advent of the 12in single in the late 1970s, the part one/part two method of recording was largely abandoned. Modern day examples are Fall Out Boy's EP, My Heart Will Always Be The B-Side To My Tongue, or My Chemical Romance's The Black Parade, The B-Sides

Since both sides of a single received equal [[royalties]], some composers deliberately arranged for their songs to be used as the B-sides of singles by popular artists. This became known as the "flipside racket".{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Similarly, it has also been alleged that owners of [[pirate radio]] stations operating off the British coast in the 1960s would buy the publishing rights to the B-sides of records they expected to be hits, and then plug the A-sides in the hope of driving up sales and increasing their share of the royalties.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Occasionally, the B-side of a single would become the more popular song. This sometimes occurred because a DJ preferred the B-side to its A-side and played it instead. Some examples include "[[I Will Survive]]" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] (originally the B-side of "Substitute"), "[[I'll Be Around (The Spinners song)|I'll Be Around]]" by [[The Spinners (American band)|the Spinners]] (originally the B-side of "[[How Could I Let You Get Away]]") and "[[Maggie May]]" by [[Rod Stewart]] (originally the B-side of "[[Reason to Believe]]").

The song "[[How Soon Is Now?]]" by [[the Smiths]] started out as the extra track on the 12-inch of ''[[William, It Was Really Nothing]]'' but later gained a separate release as an A-side in its own right, as did [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]'s "[[Acquiesce]]", which originally appeared as a B-side to "[[Some Might Say]]" in 1995, but gained subsequent release in 2006 as part of an EP to promote their forthcoming [[greatest hits|compilation]] album, ''[[Stop the Clocks]]''. [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] in 2001 and 2005 had the B-sides "Just a Day" from "Seven Days in the Sun", and "Shatter" from "[[Tumble and Fall (Feeder song)|Tumble and Fall]]" released as A-sides after fan petitions and official website and fansite message board hype, and both charted at No. 12 and No. 11 in the UK. In 1986, the first single from [[XTC]]'s record ''[[Skylarking]]'', "Grass", was eclipsed in the United States by its B-side, "[[Dear God (XTC song)|Dear God]]" – so much so that the record was almost immediately re-released with one song ("Mermaid Smiled") removed and "Dear God" put in its place, becoming one of the band's better-known hits.

On many reissued singles, the A- and B-sides are two hit songs from different albums that were not originally released together, or were by completely different artists, altogether. These were often made for the [[jukebox]], as one record with two popular songs on it would make more money, or to promote an artist to the fans of another. For example, in 1981 [[Kraftwerk]] released their new single "[[Computer Love (Kraftwerk song)|Computer Love]]" coupled with the B-side "[[The Model]]", from their 1978 [[Long Play|LP]] ''[[The Man-Machine]]''. With [[synthpop]] increasingly dominating the UK charts, the single was re-released with the sides reversed. In early 1982 "The Model" reached number one.

==Double A-side==
A "double A-side" is a single where both sides are designated the A-side; there is no B-side on such a single. The double A-sided single was invented in December 1965 by [[the Beatles]] for their single of "[[We Can Work It Out]]" and "[[Day Tripper]]", where both were designated A-sides.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, Chris. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=OykEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=double+side+campaign+unique+britain+intitle:billboard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rE2oU7X4LZOHyASU44LQDQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=double%20side%20campaign%20unique%20britain%20intitle%3Abillboard&amp;f=false Music Capitals of the World]" ''Billboard'' December 4, 1965: 26&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to use the format for the release of the singles "[[Eleanor Rigby]]" and "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]" in 1966, followed by "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]" / "[[Penny Lane]]" in 1967, and "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" / "[[Come Together]]" in 1969. Other groups followed suit, notably [[the Rolling Stones]] in early 1967 with "[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]" / "[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]" as a double-A single.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A double A-sided single is often confused with a single where both sides, the A and the B, became hits. Although many artists in the late 1950s and early 1960s like [[Elvis Presley]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[the Beach Boys]], [[Brenda Lee]], and [[Pat Boone]], routinely had hit singles where both sides of the 45 received airplay, these were not double A-sides. The charts below tally the instances for artist's singles where both sides were hits, not where both sides were designated an A-side upon manufacture and release. For instance "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]," the B-side of "[[Don't Be Cruel]]" by Elvis Presley, became as big a hit as its A-side even though "Hound Dog" was indeed not an A-side when released in 1956. Reissues later in the 1960s (and after the Beatles' "Day Tripper"/"We Can Work It Out") listed the single with both songs as the A-side. Also, for [[Cliff Richard]]'s 1962 "[[The Next Time]]"/"[[Bachelor Boy]]", both sides were marketed as songs with chart potential, albeit with "Bachelor Boy" pressed as the B-side.

In the UK, before the advent of digital downloads, both A-sides were accredited with the same chart position, as the singles' chart was compiled entirely from physical sales. In the UK, the biggest-selling non-charity single of all time was a double A-side, [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' 1977 release "[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]"/"[[Girls' School (song)|Girls' School]]", which sold over two million copies. It was also the [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|UK Christmas No. 1]] that year, one of only two occasions on which a double A-side has topped that chart, the other being [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] 1991 re-release of "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" with "[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]".&lt;ref name="UK Official Chart 2011"&gt;[http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1977-12-24/ 1977-12-24 Top 40 Official UK Singles Archive | Official Charts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] released "[[All Apologies]]" and "[[Rape Me]]" as a double A-side in 1993, and both songs are accredited as a hit on both the UK Singles Chart,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/nirvana/ Nirvana – UK Singles Chart Archive] officialcharts.com.

Retrieved October 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen released their first double-A single, "[[Killer Queen]]"/"[[Flick of the Wrist]]", in 1974. "Killer Queen" became a hit, while "Flick of the Wrist" was all but ignored for lack of promotion. Three years later, they released "[[We Are the Champions]]" with "[[We Will Rock You]]" as a B-side. Both sides of the single received much radio airplay (often one after the other), which led to them sometimes being referred to as a double A-side. In 1978 they released "[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]"/"[[Bicycle Race]]" as a double A-side; that time both sides of the single became hits.

Occasionally double-A-sided singles were released with each side targeting a different market. During the late 1970s, for example, [[Dolly Parton]] released a number of double-A-sided singles, in which one side was released to pop radio, and the other side to country, including "[[Two Doors Down]]"/"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]" and "[[Baby I'm Burning]]"/"[[I Really Got the Feeling]]". In 1978, the [[Bee Gees]] also used this method when they released "[[Too Much Heaven]]" for the pop market and the flip side, "[[Rest Your Love on Me]]", which was aimed toward country stations.

Many artists continue to release double A-sided singles outside of the US where it is seen as more popular. Examples of this include Oasis's "[[Little by Little (Oasis song)|Little by Little]]"/"[[She Is Love]]" (2002), [[Bloc Party]]'s [[So Here We Are/Positive Tension|"So Here We Are"/"Positive Tension"]] (2005) and [[Gorillaz]]'s [[El Mañana (song)|"El Mañana"]]/"[[Kids with Guns]]" (2006).

==Double B-side==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
On vinyl, double A-sided singles had one song on either side of the record, while double B-sides contained two songs on the same side (on the B-side, making three songs in all). When such singles were introduced in the 1970s, the popular term for them was "[[maxi single]]", though this term is now used more ambiguously for a variety of formats. These would not quite qualify as EPs – as that is generally four songs on a 45.

[[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]'s 1978 7-inch single "Many Too Many" featured two B-sides, "The Day the Light Went Out" and "Vancouver", both of them being outtakes from the ''[[...And Then There Were Three...]]'' album. There was no 12-inch equivalent. The band released two 7in singles with three tracks apiece, ''Spot the Pigeon'' and ''3X3'' (aka "Paperlate"), which were explicitly marked as EPs. "Spot the Pigeon" was also available in a 12-inch version, and also subverted this format a bit, by having two tracks on the A-side and one track on the B-side. The B-side, "Inside and Out", was also considered the selling point of the EP, being Steve Hackett's last contribution to the band, and remains a favorite of many fans.

[[Paul McCartney]]'s 1980 single "[[Coming Up (song)|Coming Up]]" had a studio version of the song on the A-side, while the B-side contained two songs, a live version of "Coming Up" and a studio instrumental called "[[Lunchbox/Odd Sox]]".

[[Iron Maiden]]'s 1980 7-inch single "[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]" was a rerecording of a song that had been given to the ''Metal For Muthas'' compilation the previous year. The recording was made during the ''[[Iron Maiden (album)|Iron Maiden]]'' sessions but was left off the UK album and then put out as a single. To make up for this for fans who had specifically bought ''Metal for Muthas'' for the track, the "Sanctuary" single had two live B-sides which were deliberately selected to be non-album tracks. "Drifter" and "I've Got The Fire" (Montrose cover). A studio recording of "Drifter" (with Adrian Smith instead of Dennis Stratton) would appear on their next album ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'', and a studio version of "I've Got The Fire" with Bruce Dickinson appeared on the B-side of "[[Flight of Icarus]]" a few years later. At the time this single was released they were the first live Iron Maiden tracks released (though more would follow), and it remains the only officially released recording of "I've Got The Fire" with [[Paul Di'Anno]] on vocals.

The singles from [[U2]]'s album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' were released with two B-side songs each, which were pressed at 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm. Versions for jukeboxes included only one of those songs, which played at 45.

[[The B-52's]] UK 7-inch single of "[[Love Shack]]" was released with live versions of "Planet Claire" and "Rock Lobster" on the B-side, the B-side playing at 33 1/3rpm. The follow-up "[[Roam (song)|Roam]]" followed suit, including live versions of "Whammy Kiss" and "Dance This Mess Around" on the B-side playing at 33 1/3rpm.

[[The Rolling Stones]] released "[[Brown Sugar (The Rolling Stones song)|Brown Sugar]]" from their album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' in May 1971. While the American single featured only "[[Bitch (The Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]" as the B-side, the British single added a third track, a live rendition of "[[Let It Rock (Chuck Berry song)|Let It Rock]]", the [[Chuck Berry]] classic, recorded at the University of Leeds during the 1971 tour of the UK.

==Humorous implementations==
The concept of the B-side has become so well known that many performers have released parody versions, including:
* The 1988 "[[Stutter Rap (No Sleep 'Til Bedtime)]]" by parody band [[Morris Minor and the Majors]] featured a B-side titled "Another Boring 'B'-side".
* Parody band [[Bad News (band)|Bad News]] recorded a video B-side to the VHS version of their single "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" titled "Every Mistake Imaginable" in which the band discusses that they have to record an extra three minutes of footage for the single to be chart eligible.
* [[Tracey Ullman]]'s hit "[[They Don't Know (Kirsty MacColl song)|They Don't Know]]" was backed in the UK by a song entitled "The B Side" and featured Ullman in a variety of comic monologues, many of which bemoaned the uselessness of B-sides. (The US release used the album's title track, "You Broke My Heart in 17 Places", as the B-side.)
* Paul and [[Linda McCartney]]'s B-side to Linda McCartney's "[[Seaside Woman]]" (released under the alias Suzy and the Red Stripes) was a song called "B-Side to Seaside".
* The single "O.K.?" based on the TV series ''[[Rock Follies of '77]]'' contained a song called "B-Side?" which featured [[Charlotte Cornwell]] tunelessly singing about the fact that she is not considered good enough to sing an A-side.
* The B-side of the single "[[They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!]]" by [[Napoleon XIV]] was called "!aaaH-aH, yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT" and the singer billed as "Noelopan VIX". It was the A-side played in reverse; in fact, most of the label affixed to that B-side was a mirror image of the front label (as opposed to being spelled backwards), including the letters in the "WB" shield logo.
* [[Blotto (band)|Blotto]]'s 1981 single "When the Second Feature Starts" features "The B-Side", a song about how bad B-sides are compared to A-sides.
* [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]]' novelty side project [[the Bubblemen]] released only one single in 1988, "The Bubblemen Are Coming" coupled with "The B-Side", which is a field recording of bees.
* The [[Wall of Voodoo]] 1982 12-inch EP ''Two Songs by Wall of Voodoo'' has the 10-minute joke track "There's Nothing on This Side" on the B-side.
* [[Metric (band)|Metric]] released in 2008 a single entitled "Help, I'm Alive", with a B-side "Help, I'm a B-Side".
* [[Three Dog Night]]'s 1973 single "[[Shambala (song)|Shambala]]" featured "Our 'B' Side", about the group wishing it could be trusted to write their own songs for single release. It is the only Three Dog Night single written and produced by the whole group, and features family members on background vocals.
* [[Dickie Goodman]]'s 1974 release "[[Energy Crisis '74]]" featured "The Mistake" as the B-side, which was simply a false start of the A-side, with Goodman saying, "Mr. President, the crisis...", followed by two minutes of silence. (It was literally a mistake: the intended B-side was an instrumental called "Ruthie's Theme".&lt;ref&gt;It was typical of Goodman's records to feature throwaway tunes on the reverse, often with different names. In fact, "Ruthie's Theme" is the same tune as "Problems", which appears on the B-side of the Goodman-produced "Super Fly Meets Shaft" by John and Ernest.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Goodman realized the factory had stamped a number of the botched pressings, he simply placed the full version of "Energy Crisis '74" on the other side, and released the records anyway.)
* The [[Pearl Harbor and the Explosions]] song "You Got It" was backed by "Busy Little B Side", also found on the Warner Bros. two-LP [[Warner/Reprise Loss Leaders|sampler]], ''Troublemakers''.
* The B-side of [[B.A. Robertson]]'s 1979 single "Goosebumps" is entitled "The B-Side" and contains lyrics from the song's point of view. The lyrics describe the song as being "the back of a hit" and "real popular after the war" which can be said to relate to the dominance of the 45 RPM single after this time and the change of significance of the A-side and the B-side after this time. This track also opens side two of Robertson's album ''Initial Success''.
* One of the B-sides from Lenny Kravitz's single "[[Heaven Help]]" is called "B Side Blues" and documents the sheer boredom of him being under a lot of pressure from his record company to write more successful material. 
* [[Kaiser Chiefs]] released a 7-inch single of "[[You Can Have It All]]" which featured a blank B-side. Parodying their hit record ''[[I Predict A Riot]]'', the label on this blank side suggested it contained the track "I Predict Some Quiet".

==Plot==

''Aetheric Mechanics'' is set in an [[alternate history]] March 1907, where [[steampunk]] technology is advanced far beyond the technology of the modern real world, including two-way television communications, air- and spacecraft powered by [[reactionless drive]]s, and large combat [[mecha]]. The [[British Empire]] (which in this setting, includes realms on other planets) is engaged in a war against [[Ruritania]]. The war is not going favourably for Britain; however, the British government is covering up just how badly the war is going, including the fact that Ruritania is preparing an [[invasion literature|invasion of Britain]].

Dr. Robert Watcham, a captain and doctor in the British army on the French front, returns to London at the start of the story after his tour of duty is over. His friend, roommate, and colleague, Sax Raker, is the greatest detective in London, and one of the finest minds in Britain, with Watcham having written a number of exploits about him for the popular press. At the time of Watcham's return, Raker has been commissioned by Inspector Jarratt of [[Scotland Yard]] to investigate another case. A number of observers witnessed a spectral figure, flickering in and out of existence, murdering an engineer specialising in [[luminiferous aether|aetheric]] mechanics outside of the [[Royal Society]], with several others having gone missing.

Investigating outside the Society, Raker notices traces of mud beneath the victim, then is drawn to a figure standing in the crowd. Raker reveals it to be none other than his persistent rival, Inanna Meyer, whom Watcham (in a period of narration) notes that Raker is obsessed with but is unable to face that fact. Originally surmising that Inanna was hired by the Ruritanian government to destabilise Britain's vital science and engineering community, she reveals that she is now working for the British government: Raker's brother, Dunmow, recruited her into the [[British Secret Service]], and she was also investigating the murder.

With that piece of information, Raker is able to solve the case, deducing that the mud near the victim came from the [[River Fleet]]. He therefore surmises that a villain has been kidnapping scientists to create some type of weapon directly beneath London, and the murder was done to silence a failed kidnapping. Raker, Watcham, and Inanna head into the River Fleet's underground channel as the Ruritanian aeroplanes begin a heavy fire-bombing of London in preparation for their final assault on Britain.

Beneath London, they indeed find a large colony of kidnapped scientists, now escaping from the Ruritanian bombing. The "man who wasn't there" is also found, and identifies himself as Jonathan Vogel. Vogel explains that he is actually from the future, and that the reason he is fading in and out if existence is due to an accident he experienced. Vogel was a scientist working on an addition to the [[Large Hadron Collider]] which would have enabled [[ansible]]-like communication with a [[space probe]] being sent to [[Pluto]] using a [[quantum string]]. However, the "other" end of the string became loose, fixing onto 1905 – the year the [[special relativity]] was proposed by [[Albert Einstein]], thus eliminating the theory of aether that had been held before. Vogel was sent back through time, along with his personal [[mobile device|handheld computer]] – containing, among other things, the stories of [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Sexton Blake]], ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'', and a number of old movies and Japanese anime.

Vogel explains that, to 'bridge' between the two realities, the stories contained in his handheld were merged with the real-world 1905, creating the world of ''Aetheric Mechanics'' – and that neither Sax, nor Watcham, nor Inanna, nor Ruritania were real. Vogel states that the flickering is him being stranded between two worlds, and he has constructed a computer which, within a few hours, will finish its calculation to repair the damage caused to time, allowing Vogel to return home by destroying the fictional world he created.

Seeing that as a chance to prevent Britain's destruction by Ruritania, Inanna and Watcham agree to let Vogel continue. They do not notice that Raker is horrified and outraged at the thought of not existing. Raker removes his pistol and shoots Vogel in the chest, killing him. He explains that he has finally realised the one thing he can't do: bear to think of a world where Inanna doesn't exist. Leaving Inanna and Watcham dumbstruck behind him, Raker races back through the tunnels below London, promising that using his intellect, he will still manage to find a way to prevent Britain from losing the war.

The '''Assam Higher Secondary Education Council''' (abbreviated as AHSEC) is a board of education under the [[Government of Assam|state government of Assam]]. It is the regulating body for higher secondary (10+2 stage) education in the state of Assam.

==History==
The Assam Higher Secondary Education Council was established by the Assam government on 1 June 1984 to regulate, supervise and develop the system of higher secondary education in the State of Assam.&lt;ref name="ahsec2"/&gt; AHSEC officially announce the results in the month of June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/notification/story/assam-board-hslc-hs-result-2018-class-10-class-12-results-to-be-out-before-may-31-at-resultsassam-nic-in-1231564-2018-05-11|title=Assam Board HSLC, HS Result 2018: Class 10, Class 12 results to be out before May 31 at resultsassam.nic.in|place=New Delhi|work=[[India Today]]|date=11 May 2018|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Botflies''', also known as '''warble flies''', '''heel flies''' and '''gadflies''', are a family of [[flies]] technically known as '''Oestridae'''. Their [[larva]]e are internal parasites of mammals, some species growing in the host's flesh and others within the gut. The ''[[Dermatobia hominis]]'' is the only species of botfly known to parasitize humans routinely, though other species of flies cause [[myiasis]] in humans.

==General==

Dept. of Agriculture, 1904, p 17&lt;/ref&gt; or bot-fly&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in various combinations, is any [[fly]] in the [[Family (biology)|family]] Oestridae.  Their lifecycles vary greatly according to species, but the [[larva]]e of all species are internal parasites of mammals. Largely according to species, they also are known variously as [[warble flies]], heel flies, and gadflies. The larvae of some species grow in the flesh of their hosts, while others grow within the hosts' [[Gut (anatomy)|alimentary tracts]].

The word "bot" in this sense means a maggot.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"/&gt; A warble is a skin lump or callus such as might be caused by an ill-fitting harness, or by the presence of a warble fly maggot under the skin. 
The human botfly, ''[[Dermatobia hominis]]'', is the only species of botfly whose larvae ordinarily parasitise humans, though flies in some other families episodically cause human [[myiasis]] and are sometimes more harmful.

The bot fly will hijack a mosquito to inject the host with the eggs.

==Family Oestridae==
The Oestridae now are generally defined as including  the former families [[Oestrinae|Oestridae]], [[Cuterebrinae|Cuterebridae]], [[Gasterophilinae|Gasterophilidae]], and [[Hypodermatinae|Hypodermatidae]] as [[Family (biology)|subfamilies]].

The Oestridae, in turn, are a family within the superfamily [[Oestroidea]], together with the families [[Calliphoridae]], [[Rhinophoridae]], [[Flesh-fly|Sarcophagidae]], and [[Tachinidae]].

Of families of flies causing [[myiasis]], the Oestridae include the highest proportion of species whose [[larva]]e live as obligate [[parasite]]s within the bodies of [[mammal]]s. Roughly 150 species are known worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pape |first=Thomas |date=April 2001 |title=Phylogeny of Oestridae (Insecta: Diptera) |journal=[[Systematic Entomology]] |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=133–171 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-3113.2001.00143.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most other species of flies implicated in myiasis are members of related families, such as blowflies and screwworm flies in the [[Calliphoridae]].

== Infestation ==
[[File:Magendassel.jpg|right|thumb|Larval stage of ''Gasterophilus intestinalis'']]
Botflies deposit eggs on a host, or sometimes use an intermediate vector such as the common [[housefly]], mosquitoes, and, in the case of ''[[Dermatobia hominis]]'', a species of tick. They are common in Belize. The smaller fly is firmly held by the botfly female and rotated to a position where the botfly attaches some 30 eggs to the body under the wings. Larvae from these eggs, stimulated by the warmth and proximity of a large mammal host, drop onto its skin and burrow underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Dunleavy, Stephen (producer) |date=2005-10-20 |title=Life In The Undergrowth: Intimate Relations (Programme synopses) |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/10_october/20/life_synopses.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermediate vectors are often used, since a number of animal hosts recognise the approach of a botfly and flee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://insects.tamu.edu/fieldguide/cimg241.html | chapter = Horse Bot Fly | title = Field Guide to Texas Insects | last = Drees | first = B.M. | first2 = John | last2 = Jackman | year = 1999 | publisher = Gulf Publishing Company | location = Houston, Texas | accessdate = 12 June 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121114065440/http://insects.tamu.edu/fieldguide/cimg241.html# | archive-date = 2012-11-14 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eggs are deposited on animal [[skin]] directly, or the [[larva]]e hatch and drop from the eggs attached to the intermediate vector: the body heat of the host animal induces hatching upon contact or immediate proximity. Some forms of botfly also occur in the [[digestive tract]] after ingestion by licking.
[[File:Ox Warble-fly.png|thumb|right|Ox warble fly (''[[Hypoderma bovis]]'')]]

[[Myiasis]] can be caused by larvae burrowing into the skin (or tissue lining) of the host animal. Mature larvae drop from the host and complete the [[pupa]]l stage in soil. They do not kill the host animal, thus they are true [[Parasitism|parasites]].

The equine botflies present seasonal difficulties to [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] caretakers, as they lay eggs on the insides of horses' front legs, on the [[cannon bone]] and [[knees]] and sometimes on the [[throat]] or [[nose]], depending on the species. These eggs, which look like small, yellow drops of paint, must be carefully removed during the laying season (late summer and early fall) to prevent infestation in the horse. When a horse rubs its nose on its legs, the eggs are transferred to the mouth and from there to the [[intestines]], where the larvae grow and attach themselves to the stomach lining or the small intestine. The attachment of the larvae to the tissue produces a mild irritation which results in erosions and ulcerations at the site.&lt;ref name="Ondrak"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ondrak |first=Julie |title=Ask The Vet: Treating Bot Infestations In Horses |url=http://www.lambriarvet.com/vet-equine-bots.php |website= lambriarvet.com |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of the eggs (which adhere to the host's hair) is difficult, since the bone and [[tendons]] are directly under the skin on the cannon bones: eggs must be removed with a sharp knife (often a razor blade) or rough sandpaper and caught before they reach the ground. The larvae remain attached and develop for 10–12 months before they are passed out in the feces. Occasionally, horse owners report seeing botfly larvae in horse manure. These larvae are cylindrical in shape and are reddish orange in color. In one to two months, adult botflies emerge from the developing larvae and the cycle repeats itself.&lt;ref name="Ondrak"/&gt; Botflies can be controlled with several types of dewormers, including [[dichlorvos]], [[ivermectin]] and [[trichlorfon]].

In cattle, the lesions caused by these flies can become infected by ''[[Mannheimia granulomatis]]'', a [[bacterium]] that causes [[lechiguana]], characterized by rapid-growing, hard lumps beneath the skin of the animal. Without antibiotics, an affected animal will die within three to 11 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ross |last=Piper |chapter=Human Botfly |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqegRf2UstIC&amp;pg=PA192 |title=Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=[[Westport, Connecticut]] |year=2007 |pages=192–194 |isbn=0-313-33922-8 |oclc=191846476 |accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. |last=Riet-Correa |author2=S.

''[[Dermatobia hominis]]'', the human botfly, occasionally uses humans to host its larvae. The larva, because of its spines, can pose an extremely painful subepidermal condition. The fastest way to remove a botfly is by putting a generous amount of iodine in the hole. The botfly will react instantly by poking out of the hole{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Another removal method is to use the tree sap of the ''mata[[torsalo]]'', found in Costa Rica, which is reputed to kill the larva, yet leave its body in the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pariser |first=Harry S |year=2006 |title=Explore Costa Rica |publisher=Manatee Press |isbn=1-893643-55-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one can attempt to seal the breathing hole of the larva with [[nail polish]] or [[petroleum jelly]]; after a day, with a clinical professional, the breathing hole is enlarged and the larva is removed with forceps. Squeezing the larvae out is not recommended, as it can cause the larvae to rupture; their bodily fluids have been known to cause severe [[anaphylactic shock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capcvet.org/capc-recommendations/cuterebriasis/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728000805/http://www.capcvet.org/capc-recommendations/cuterebriasis/|date=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of [[adhesive tape]] can work, but carries additional risk of infection because portions of the larva's [[Siphon (insect)|breathing tube]] can be broken off by the tape and make the remainder of the body difficult to remove.

==Consumption of maggots by humans==
In cold climates supporting [[reindeer]] or [[caribou]]-reliant populations, large quantities of ''[[Hypoderma tarandi]]'' (caribou warble fly) maggots are available to human populations during the butchery of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CfTzAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA482|title=Caribou warble grubs edible|first=E.P.|last=Felt|year=1918|journal=Journal of Economic Entomology|volume=11|page=482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth episode of season one of the television series ''Beyond Survival'' entitled "The Inuit – Survivors of the Future" features survival expert [[Les Stroud]] and two Inuit guides hunting caribou on the northern coast of [[Baffin Island]] near [[Pond Inlet]], [[Nunavut]], Canada. Upon skinning and butchering of one of the animals, numerous larvae (presumably ''[[Hypoderma tarandi]]'', although not explicitly stated) are apparent on the inside of the caribou pelt. Stroud and his two Inuit guides eat (albeit somewhat reluctantly) one larva each, with Stroud commenting that the larva "tastes like milk" and was historically commonly consumed by the Inuit people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lesstroud.ca/beyondsurvival/ep6.php |title=Les Stroud Beyond Survival: The Inuit – Survivors of the Future |publisher=Lesstroud.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302015601/http://lesstroud.ca/beyondsurvival/ep6.php |archivedate=2016-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cecil Purnell''' is a [[Swiss]] luxury watch company based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] that specialises in the production of high-end [[tourbillon]] watches.

==History==

In 1918, the company's founder and namesake, Cecil Purnell,&lt;ref&gt;[http://montre24.com/brand/Cecil-Purnell/aboutCecilPurnell/About Cecil Purnell]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; began his fascination with intricate mechanical horological mechanisms with the [[tourbillon]] of [[Abraham Louis Bréguet]]. His interest was transmitted to his grandson, Jonathan Purnell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groundreport.com/Lifestyle/Cecil-Purnell-and-The-Art-of-Collecting/2944310 Cecil Purnell and the Art of Collecting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322040907/http://www.groundreport.com/Lifestyle/Cecil-Purnell-and-The-Art-of-Collecting/2944310 |date=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Jonathan Purnell formed an association with watch industry professional Stéphane Valsamides and together they launched Cecil Purnell SA in the Swiss [[Jura Mountains]]. After years of development, in 2009, Cecil Purnell launched its first caliber that was developed fully in-house, the CP3000, and transferred the company’s operations to [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-749310 The History of the Timepiece]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Cecil Purnell became a micro-manufacturer that produces all of its components internally. The watchmaker launched its second complication, the Big Date caliber, in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horozima.com/2011/03/cecil-purnell-la-grande-date.html Cecil Purnell La Grande Date]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''creative professional''' who is also known as a '''creative specialist''' is a person who is employed for the extraction of skills in creative endeavors. Creative professions include writing, art, design, theater, television, radio, motion pictures, related crafts, as well as marketing, strategy, scientific research and development, product development, engineering, some types of teaching and curriculum design, and more. Since many creative professionals (actors and writers, for example) are also employed in secondary professions, estimates of creative professionals are often inaccurate. By some estimates, approximately 10 million US workers are creative professionals; depending upon the depth and breadth of the definition, this estimate may be doubled.

==History==
Although creative professionals have been a part of the workforce for more than 500 years, several events during the past decade have altered industry and public perception of these workers.

The change in status began in the late 1990s when demand for creative workers was high due to the internet boom. Creative workers found that their talents in [[graphic design|graphic]] and interactive design were valuable, and so, the workers began to develop independent cultures in select cities throughout the world, notably [[San Francisco]], [[New York City]] and [[Boston]]. Some smaller cities, such as [[Austin]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] also became centers where creative people found abundant opportunity. This trend has been documented in author [[Richard Florida]]'s book, The Creative Class.

As the creative workforce has evolved in the post-dot.com era, creative workers have continued to flourish. [[Daniel H. Pink]]'s book ''A Whole New Mind'' describes the transition in American business from [[information age]] to conceptual age. Pink describes information-era jobs as expendable and exportable, and offers that the [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] may yield more value for newer American workers than the [[MBA]] might generate in today's economy.

The Creative Professional, by Howard Blumenthal, describes the phenomenon from yet another perspective: that of the individual worker now emerging as a serious business professional with specific skills on par with lawyers, accountants, doctors, and other workers who are perceived to be within a special class. The book describes the unique business and career issues for the individual creative worker.

==Expansion of scope and study==
To date, most of the information about this growing phenomenon exists in book form. Many of the ideas and mechanisms are related to changes in copyright law, as described by [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Creative Commons]].

University education for creative professionals is often presented under older definitions of music, art, and related disciplines, but the processes related to creative thought, particularly as they apply to work, are found in books about cognitive psychology. Author and cognitive thinking researcher [[Howard Gardner]] has defined a variety of intelligences related to creative workers. Psychologist [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] has described the process of creative work effectively in several books, including Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience. Professors in Business have also started to explore the success factors for creative professionals including Harvard Business School Professor [[Teresa Amabile]] who has studied and published research on creative professionals like author John Irving &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mallory Stark and Martha Lagace|title=John Irving's Lessons for Business|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/2000.html|year=2001|accessdate=2007-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Corporate research and the development of products and services specifically for creative professionals has started to crop up as companies hire increasing numbers of creative professionals to compete on innovation. Recent changes to corporate slogans are indicative of the trend. In 2003, GE's slogan changed from "We Bring Good Things To Life" to "Imagination at Work" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael McCarthy|title='Imagination at Work' for GE|publisher=USA TODAY|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2003-05-04-ge_x.htm|accessdate=2007-05-28 | date=2003-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hewlett Packard adopted the slogan "Invent."

Creativity, such as poetic creativity, has been an area of fascination for many ancient traditions.   For example, Nasadiya Sukta the Hindu creation hymn states "Poets found the bond of being in non-being in their heart's thought, but who really knows how creation happened?".

[[File:Two scenes from Der Busant.jpg|300px|thumb|Tapestry from [[Alsace]] depicting two scenes from the poem (1480–90)]]
'''''Der Busant''''', also known as '''''Der Bussard''''' (both German names for the [[Common Buzzard]]), is a [[Middle High German]] verse narrative, containing 1074 lines of rhyming [[couplet]]s.{{sfn|Meyer|Mooyer|1833|p=37}} The story tells of a love affair between the Princess of France and the Prince of England, who elope but are separated after a buzzard steals one of the princess's rings. After more than a year of separation, with the prince having gone mad and living as a [[wild man]], they are reunited.

Known from a single fifteenth-century [[manuscript]] and three fragments, ''Der Busant'' emerged from a thematic tradition of wild men, thieving birds, and adventures of separated lovers. It is close to several other contemporary stories, such that a common origin has been hypothesised. The work has been described as a novel-like example of the ''[[Märe (literature)|Märe]]'' style of poetry. Cultural impact of the poem is visible in several surviving tapestries, as well as a possible influence in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.
&lt;!--ö ä ü --&gt;

==Contents==
The Princess of France is engaged to the King of Morocco in an unwanted political marriage. To rescue her, the Prince of England (then studying in Paris) disguises himself, sneaks into the castle, and finds her. The two then elope. While she is sleeping in a forest, he admires two of her rings. Suddenly, a buzzard flies by and steals one of them. The prince follows the bird but gets lost in the woods and loses his mind from grief.

The prince lives for a year as a [[wild man]]. In the meantime, the princess has taken refuge in a mill and makes a living sewing, waiting all the time for her lover's return. She is taken in, unrecognized, by the prince's uncle (a duke) and aunt, who had become interested in the origin of the fine needlework and, after taking one look at the princess, recognizes her nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schultz|first=James A.|year=1995|title=No Girls, No Boys, No Families: On the Construction of Childhood in Texts of the German Middle Ages|journal=[[The Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]|volume=94|issue=1|pages=59–81|jstor=27711099}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day the duke is out hunting and captures the wild prince, whom he takes back to the castle and attempts for six weeks to cure.

When the prince is about to prove his noble upbringing during a hunt for falcons, he captures a buzzard and to everyone's surprise bites its head off. When he explains his actions, he recounts his story, and the princess is able to recognise him.{{efn|A common method: "narration by a character of her life story as a device to bring about a recognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Göpp|first=Philip H.|year=1938|title=The Narrative Material of Apollonius of Tyre|journal=[[ELH]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages=150–72|jstor=2871615|doi=10.2307/2871615}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The two then live happily ever after.

==Manuscript and fragments==
The poem survives in its entirety in one fifteenth-century manuscript, and there are three additional fragments. The manuscript is preserved in the [[Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Bremen|State and University Library of Bremen]], MS B.42&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;, which, according to Hans-Friedrich Rosenfeld, is "poorly and randomly corrected" (''schlecht und willkürlich korrigiert''). The three fragments are in [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]], cod. 1432; [[Baden State Library]] cod. St. Georg 86; and in the private collection of [[August Closs]], formerly owned by [[Baden State Library]].&lt;ref name=rosenfeld&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenfeld|first=Hans-Friedrich|editor=Kurt Ruh|title=[[:de:Verfasserlexikon|Verfasserlexikon]]|volume=1|year=1978|pages=1145–48|chapter='Der Bussard' (früher 'Der Busant')|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandra Linden, following Rosenfeld and Reinhold Köhler,&lt;ref name=kohler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Köhler|first=Reinhold|year=1872|title=Das althochdeutschen Gedicht 'Der Busant' und das altfranzösische 'L'Escoufle'|journal=[[Germania: Vierteljahrsschrift für deutsche Altertumskunde]]|volume=17|pages=62–64|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; dates the work to the early fourteenth century.&lt;ref name="Linden"/&gt; The manuscript contains 172 double-sided sheets of [[cotton paper]]; a copy of the work of the thirteenth-century Swabian poet [[Freidank]] takes up most of the first half of the manuscript. Each page contains 24 lines; [[initial]]s such as chapter titles and initial capitals are in red. The manuscript is bound with two [[parchment]] deeds serving as covers (one of them dated to 1403; the heavily damaged other, a deed of sale pertaining to a house in Basel, is older); the deeds prove that the manuscript was bound and held for a long time in Switzerland.{{sfn|Meyer|Mooyer|1833|p=vii}}

Meyer and Mooyer, who published the contents of the manuscript in 1833, comment that the copier and compiler seemed to have organized his materials haphazardly and all-too freely (even carelessly) adapted spelling to his own taste; a sixteenth-century editor corrected many errors in the manuscript's margins. Still, many lines appear to be missing and others make little sense.{{sfn|Meyer|Mooyer|1833|pp=ix–x}} The manuscript was long thought lost, until it was rediscovered in the city library of [[Bremen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campion|first=John L.|year=1922|title=Rev. of Meyer-Benfey, ''Mittelhochdeutsche Übungsstücke''|journal=[[Modern Philology]]|volume=20|issue=1|page=107|jstor=433339|doi=10.1086/387439}}&lt;/ref&gt; How it got there from Switzerland is unknown.{{sfn|Meyer|Mooyer|1833|p=ix}} A page is retained in the fragment of a collection c. 1380, written on paper in the [[Alsace]] and edited by Robert Priebsch; the fragment was in the collection of [[August Closs]], which was bequeathed to the [[Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Priebsch|first=Robert|year=1922|title=Bruchstücke deutscher Dichtungen des 13.-14.

==Thematic background==
Central to the plot of the poem is the theme of the buzzard (or other bird of prey) who swoops down from the skies to steal a lady's ring, prompting her knight to go and find the ring again. The lovers are thus separated for a while, and the knight is given the opportunity for adventure before they are reunited. A popular theme in literature probably deriving from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' material, it first appears in Western literature in ''Guillaume d'Angleterre''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vigneras|first=L.-A.|year=1939|title=Notes sur Jean Renart|journal=[[Modern Language Notes]]|volume=54|issue=4|pages=262–66|jstor=2911983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is in use still, as evidenced in [[Peter Bichsel]]'s "Der Busant" (1998),&lt;ref name=Linden/&gt; a story also involving loss of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cocalis|first=S. L.|year=1986|title=Rev. of Bichsel, ''Der Busant: Von Trinkern, Polizisten und der schönen Magelone''|journal=[[World Literature Today]]|volume=60|issue=2|page=308|jstor=40141771|doi=10.2307/40141771}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is to be distinguished from what folklorist [[Gordon Hall Gerould]] called "the motive of the man tried by fate", since the main character in such stories (Gerould categorizes them as following the [[Saint Eustace]] motif) experiences separation from society for different (usually religious) reasons.&lt;ref name="Gerould"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerould|first=Gordon Hall|year=1904|title=Forerunners, Congeners, and Derivatives of the Eustace Legend|journal=[[Publications of the Modern Language Association|PMLA]]|volume=19|issue=3|pages=335–448|jstor=456497|doi=10.2307/456497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among contemporary texts, ''Der Busant'' shares the theme of a treasure being stolen by a bird with several other works. This includes ''L'Escoufle'' by [[Jean Renart]] (twelfth or thirteenth century), a [[chivalric romance]] 1902 lines long in which a [[Kite (bird)|kite]] performs the same action,&lt;ref name="Amer"/&gt; as well as the Italian ''La storia di Ottinello e Giulia'', the French ''La belle histoire d'amour de Pierre de Provence et de la belle Maguelonne, fille du roi de Naples'', and a story from the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', "Tale of Kamar al-Zaman".&lt;ref name="Gerould"/&gt; Paul Meyer compared ''Der Busant'' and ''L'Escoufle'' and suggests that the two were derived from a single source, yet to be found;&lt;ref name="Amer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Crossing Borders: Love Between Women in Medieval French and Arabic Literatures |last=Amer |year=2008|first=Sahar |publisher=U of Pennsylvania P |page=198 |location=Philadelphia|isbn= 9780812240870}}&lt;/ref&gt; the comparison was first made by Köhler, and according to Rosenfeld, later cited by Linden, that original is a French text.&lt;ref name=rosenfeld/&gt;&lt;ref name=kohler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Linden/&gt; Ph. Aug. Becker, however, in a 1937 review of a study of Renart, denies such a source text and claims the theme as Renart's own invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Becker|first=Ph. Aug.|year=1937|title=Rev. of Lejeune-Dehousse, ''L'oeuvre de Jehan Renart''|journal=[[Zeitschrift für französische Sprache und Literatur]]|volume=60|issue=1/2|pages=113–25|jstor=40615614}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rosenfeld, style and individual motifs suggest that the fourteenth-century original of the poem was influenced by [[Konrad von Würzburg]] (he singles out his ''Partonopier''); the [[Elopement (marriage)|elopement]] is, he says, influenced by [[Rudolf von Ems]]'s ''Wilhelm von Orlens'', and the depiction of the Prince's madness by [[Hartmann von Aue]]'s ''[[Iwein]]''.&lt;ref name=rosenfeld/&gt;

The general theme of a man becoming wild, evident in the Prince's transformations, is likewise an old one: it dates back to the eleventh century, with twelfth-century figures such as [[Merlin]], [[Tristan]], [[Renaud de Montauban]], and [[Valentine and Orson|Orson]] also undergoing such a temporary transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wild Men in the Middle Ages by Richard Bernheimer: Review |last=de Tervarent |first=Guy |journal=[[The Burlington Magazine|The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs]] |volume=96 |issue=617 |date=August 1954 |pages=262, 265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prince's descent into madness is conventional in many ways. Typical for this kind of narrative poem, according to Linden, is the opposition between culture and nature, and the prince's madness follows a conventional plot: he moves away from culture and into the moral and physical wilderness (''Gewilde'') of the forest, where chaos reigns; as he does so, he loses, one by one, the qualities which characterize him as a human of high birth—by scratching and hitting himself he destroys his beauty, he tears his clothes off, and finally he begins walking on all fours. He shares this particular development toward insanity with such characters as [[Ywain]] and [[Lancelot]].&lt;ref name="Linden"/&gt; According to John Twyning, this descent into madness in ''Der Busant'' inspired the plot in which four lovers are lost in the woods in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''; he describes the latter as an intended "riff" on the German poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forms of English History in Literature, Landscape, and Architecture |last=Twyning |first=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFjJtYfKXpUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Busant&amp;f=false |year=2008 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=9780230020009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem used to be considered a novel-like example of the ''[[Märe (literature)|Märe]]'' ([[:de:Märe|in German]]), which is a German style of [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]], typically between 150 and 2000 lines, usually dealing with profane matters such as love; some critics discern three different types—farcical, courtly, and didactic.&lt;!--this excursion will be removed once Yngvadottir writes the main article--&gt; ''Der Busant'' partakes of the French tradition of ''[[Die schöne Magelone]]'' ([[:de:Die schöne Magelone|in German]]), but also shows affinity with the work of [[Konrad von Würzburg]] and the ''[[Iwein]]''.&lt;ref name="Linden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Linden|first=Sandra|editor-last=Ackermann |editor-first=Christiane |editor2-last=Barton |editor2-first=Ulrich|title='Texte zum Sprechen bringen': Philologie und Interpretation.

==Tapestries==
Numerous depictions of the poem were produced, including a long piece of [[tapestry]] with fragments now held in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, [[Museum für Angewandte Kunst (Cologne)|Museum für Angewandte Kunst]] in Cologne, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] in Nuremberg, and in Paris. The Metropolitan piece shows the Prince of England as a wild man, whilst the Princess of France, mounted on her [[palfrey]], finds refuge with a poor man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two scenes from Der Busant.jpg |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/466127?rpp=60&amp;pg=3&amp;gallerynos=010&amp;rndkey=20130829&amp;ft=*&amp;pos=133 |accessdate=31 August 2013|work=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Figdor Tapestries |last=Marillier |first=H.

'''Diversity of tactics''' is a phenomenon wherein a [[social movement]] makes periodic use of force for disruptive or [[Self-defense|defensive]] purposes, stepping beyond the limits of nonviolence, but also stopping short of total militarization.&lt;ref&gt;Amory Starr, [https://www.academia.edu/1273669/_Excepting_Barricades_Erected_to_Prevent_Us_from_Peacefully_Assembling_So-called_Violencein_the_Global_North_Alterglobalization_Movement "...'Excepting Barricades Erected to Prevent Us from Peaceably Assembling'..."], ''Social Movement Studies'', Vol. 5, No. 1, 61–81, May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.mediacoop.ca/blog/bineshii/15604 "Tactical Diversity in Successful Social Movements"], ''Vancouver Media Co-op'', January 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to the theory which asserts this to be the most effective strategy of civil disobedience for social change.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Feigenbaum, [http://uppingtheanti.org/journal/article/05-death-of-a-dichotomy/ "Death of a Dichotomy: Tactical Diversity and the Politics of Post-Violence"], ''Upping the Anti: A Journal of Theory and Action'', May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity of tactics may promote [[civil resistance|nonviolent tactics]], or armed resistance, or a range of methods in between, depending on the level of repression the political movement is facing. It sometimes claims to advocate for "forms of resistance that maximize respect for life".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/free/pga/hallm.htm "Hallmarks of People’s Global Action (updated at the 3rd PGA conference at Cochamamba, 2001)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of concept ==

The first clear articulation of diversity of tactics appears to have emerged from [[Malcolm X]] and other radical leaders in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the early 1960s. Shortly after Malcolm announced his departure from the [[Nation of Islam]], he gave a speech entitled "The Black Revolution" where he promoted solidarity between those who practiced armed resistance against racism, and those who practiced nonviolence. He stated:

::Our people have made the mistake of confusing the methods with the objectives. As long as we agree on objectives, we should never fall out with each other just because we believe in different methods or tactics or strategy to reach a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm X Speaks, George Breitman, ed. (Grove Press, 1994 edition), 46-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1964, [[Gloria Richardson]], leader of the Cambridge Maryland chapter of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), took Malcolm X up on his offer to join forces with civil rights organizations. Richardson (who’d recently been honored on stage at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]]) told ''[[The Baltimore Afro-American]]'' that "Malcolm is being very practical…The federal government has moved into conflict situations only when matters approach the level of insurrection. Self-defense may force Washington to intervene sooner."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1715&amp;dat=19640310&amp;id=1mY8AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DCoMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1694,6977757 "Mrs. Richardson OKs Malcolm X"], ''The Baltimore Afro-American'', March 10, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, [[Howard Zinn]] (then on SNCC’s Board of Advisers) published his essay "The Limits of Nonviolence," in the influential civil rights journal ''[[Freedomways]]''. In the article, the historian concluded that nonviolent direct action would not be sufficient to break Jim Crow in the South.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/nv_zinn.htm Howard Zinn “The Limits of Nonviolence”], ''Freedomways'', 1st quarter, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1965 book, ''SNCC: The New Abolitionists'', Zinn explained the philosophy that dominated the movement:

::The members of SNCC—and indeed the whole civil rights movement—have faced in action that dilemma which confounds man in society: that he cannot always have both peace and justice. To insist on perfect tranquility with an absolute rejection of violence may mean surrendering the right to change an unjust social order. On the other hand, to seek justice at any cost may result in bloodshed so great that its evil overshadows everything else and splatters the goal beyond recognition. The problem is to weigh carefully the alternatives, so as to achieve the maximum of social progress with a minimum of pain. Society has been guilty of much quick and careless weighing in the past…on the other hand, it has permitted the most monstrous injustices which it might have eliminated with a bit of trouble.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''SNCC: The New Abolitionists'' (South End Press, 2002 edition), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zinn's ''Disobedience and Democracy'' ===
In 1968, Zinn elaborated further on tactical diversity with his book ''Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order''. The text was published in response to liberal Supreme Court Justice [[Abe Fortas]], who’d recently written (in his book ''Concerning Dissent and Civil Disobedience'') that he supported Gandhian forms of direct action, but not tactics that involved resisting arrest; Fortas also rejected campaigns involving the strategic violation of normally just laws, or the destruction of another party’s property, or the injury to an oppressive party, including in direct self-defense (All of these tactics were becoming widespread in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Black Power movement]] and in the campaign against the [[Vietnam War]]).

Zinn produced an extended rebuttal to Fortas’ position; Regarding resisting arrest and judgment, Zinn countered that Gandhi had accepted the bad influence of Plato, who in his ''[[Crito]]'' dialogue, portrayed Socrates as cheerfully accepting his death sentence on the grounds that the citizen is obligated to abide by the final decision of the government, which is like a master to the people. Zinn points out that these are "the arguments of the Legalist, of the [[statist]], not the libertarian," and notes that Plato disdained democracy. In the face of Plato’s concern that sustained defiance of the law could topple the foundations of government, Zinn argues: "When unjust decisions become the rule, then the government and its officials should be toppled."

On the breaking of normally just laws and conventions for the purpose of protest, Zinn notes that some of society’s worst problems—"like hunger, or poor housing, or lack of medical care"—are not the result of discrete laws, but of system-wide conditions; therefore targets cannot always be precise: "Our most deep-rooted troubles are not represented by specific laws, but are so woven into the American society that the only way to get at them is to attack the fabric at any vulnerable point."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order'' (South End Press edition, 2002), pp. 5-6, 28-30, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinn rejects the liberal’s "easy and righteous dismissal of violence," noting that [[Henry Thoreau]], the popularizer of the term civil disobedience, approved of the armed insurrection of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. Zinn acknowledges that "nonviolence is more desirable than violence as a means" but also posits that:

::…in the inevitable tension accompanying the transition from a violent world to a nonviolent one, the choice of means will almost never be pure, and will involve such complexities that the simple distinction between violence and nonviolence does not suffice as a guide...the very acts with which we seek to do good cannot escape the imperfections of the world we are trying to change.

In particular, Zinn rejects moralizing over property destruction as historically ignorant and ethically shortsighted. He contends that in response to the massive violence of the state, the smashing of windows is a mercifully restrained disruption:

::The degree of disorder in civil disobedience should not be weighed against a false ‘peace’ presumed to exist in the status quo, but against the real disorder and violence that are part of daily life, overtly expressed internationally in wars, but hidden locally under that facade of ‘order’ which obscures the injustice of contemporary society.

Zinn then addresses the claim that violence does irreparable harm to a movement’s cause, countering that history repeatedly shows both the limitations of nonviolence and the efficacy of combative means: "Not until Negro demonstrations resulted in violence did the national government begin to work seriously on civil rights," the historian notes, using the [[Birmingham riot of 1963]] as an example. Peaceful methods "were enough to raise the issue, but not to resolve it."

At the same time, Zinn proposes "a moral code on violence in civil disobedience," which would "consider whether the disorder or violence is controlled or indiscriminate…" This would engender a partially violent, yet predominantly non-lethal insurrection, which would be preferable to the alternative of a fully militarized, bloody civil war. Ultimately, Zinn comes down squarely for diversity of tactics:

::Each situation in the world is unique and requires unique combinations of tactics…all the vast range of possible tactics beyond strict nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;*Zinn, ''Disobedience'', pp. 39-41, 121-122, 51-61, 47, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Disobedience and Democracy'' sold over 70,000 copies (making it Zinn’s most popular book prior to ''A People’s History of the United States'')&lt;ref&gt;Davis D. Joyce, ''Howard Zinn: A Radical American Vision'', 102.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as "the theoretical buttress to the many acts of civil disobedience committed during those years of the war in Vietnam."&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, ''Disobedience'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate around WTO shutdown of 1999 ===
In the years after the end of the Vietnam War, protest in the US came to assume more orderly forms, and was increasingly dominated by the middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;Doug McAdam, et al. [http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/sampson/files/2005_mobilization.pdf “There Will Be Fighting in the Streets: The Distorting Lens of Social Movement Theory”], ''Mobilization: An International Journal'' 10(1): 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; When the anti-nuclear power movement made progress after the partial meltdown of Three Mile Island, a rigorously nonviolent strategy—promoted by [[Bill Moyer]] and the [[Movement for a New Society]], and embodied in the [[Clamshell Alliance]]—was often credited for the advance, and these methods came to dominate the [[social justice]] community.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Cristol and T.

These currents largely constrained disruptive protest until the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|1999 demonstrations against the World Trade Organization]]. In an unprecedented success for post-Vietnam era civil disobedience, the WTO Ministerial Conference opening ceremonies were shut down completely, host city Seattle declared a state of emergency for nearly a week, multilateral trade negotiations between the wealthy and developing nations collapsed, and all of this was done without fatalities. This occurred in the midst of mass rioting which had been set off by militant anarchists (some of them in a [[black bloc]] formation), nonviolent civil disobedience organized by various NGOs (including [[Public Citizen]] and [[Global Exchange]]) and the Seattle [[Direct Action Network]] (DAN), and a mass permitted march organized by the AFL-CIO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/wtohist/day2.htm "Day 2- November 30, 1999"], WTO History Project, University of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/544135.stm “Seattle Declares Civil Emergency”], BBC News, December 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Vidal, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/05/wto.globalisation "The real battle of Seattle"], ''The Guardian'', December 5, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead up to the shutdown, local group Seattle Anarchist Response (SAR) had circulated Ward Churchill’s text ''[[Pacifism as Pathology]]'' freely among protesters. SAR actively promoted diversity of tactics among the rank-and-file of DAN and criticized [[NGO]] hegemony of the protests. They often found an enthusiastic response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bikesexual.org/cm/wto/prepare.htm Seattle Anarchist Response Bulletin], November 15, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; One DAN organizer told ''The Seattle Weekly'' that "I'm emerging with a less strong opinion of what is right and wrong, and using different tactics so long as they're used well. That's not where I was a year ago." The call for the Seattle protest had originally come from [[Peoples Global Action]] (a network co-founded by the [[EZLN|Zapatistas]]) which supported diversity of tactics and a highly flexible definition of nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;Geov Parrish, [http://www.seattleweekly.com/1999-11-17/news/beyond-gandhi "Beyond Gandhi"], ''The Seattle Weekly'', November 17, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the shutdown, however, various NGO spokespeople associated with Seattle DAN claimed that the riotous aspect of the WTO protests was counterproductive and undemocratic. They also asserted that it was only an insignificantly small group from Eugene, Oregon that engaged in property destruction. [[Medea Benjamin]] told ''The New York Times'' that "These anarchists should have been arrested,"&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Cockburn and our readers, [http://www.thenation.com/article/wto-workers-world-united# “WTO: Workers of the World United?”] ''The Nation'', February 14, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Egan, [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/02/world/talks-and-turmoil-the-violence-black-masks-lead-to-pointed-fingers-in-seattle.html “Black masks lead to pointed fingers in Seattle”], ''The New York Times'', December 2, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; while Lori Wallach of Public Citizen stated that she had instructed Teamsters to assault black bloc participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/documents/Lori's%20War.pdf "Lori’s War"], ''Foreign Policy'', Spring 2000, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a group of scholar-activists including [[Christian Parenti]], [[Robin Hahnel]], and [[George Katsiaficas]] signed an open letter denouncing the "tide of reaction" that the NGO sector was organizing against militant protesters. "Those who belittle and distance themselves from the actions of ‘the Anarchists from Eugene’ have either ignored or simply did not realize the level of contributions anarchists—black-clad and otherwise—made towards bringing the November 30th Festival of Resistance into reality." They also asserted that the established left, by advocating violence against certain protesters in order to protect corporate property, was fostering "an uncritical acceptance of the dominant value system of American consumer society: private property has a higher value than life." &lt;ref&gt;Daniel Burton-Rose, Ward Churchill, Robin Hahnel, Kent Jewell, George Katsiaficis, Christian Parenti, and Robert Perkinson, [http://www.urban75.com/Action/seattle8.html “WTO Protester Organizers: Don’t Throw the Radicals Overboard”], December 2, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her own response to the controversy, [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] decried the NGO leaders as "hypocrites," and wrote that nonviolent activists ought to be "treating the young rock-throwers like sisters and brothers in the struggle." The author-activist also criticized the dominant nonviolent paradigm as "absurdly ritualized," as well as elitist for presuming to reject any protester who hadn’t gone through nonviolence training "for hours or even days." Ehrenreich concluded: "The people at Direct Action Network, Global Exchange, and other groups were smart enough to comprehend the workings of the WTO, [[IMF]], and [[World Bank]]. Now it's time for them to figure out how large numbers of people can protest the international capitalist cabal without getting clobbered—or trashed by their fellow demonstrators—in the process."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Ehrenreich, [http://www.alternet.org/story/9309/flip_side%3A_anarkids_and_hypocrites "Anarkids and Hyprocrites"], ''The Progressive'', June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution to Ehrenreich’s impasse was the growing acceptance of diversity of tactics in the anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Conway, [http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1424&amp;context=ohlj "Civil Resistance and the Diversity of Tactics in the Anti-Globalization Movement: Problems of Violence, Silence, and Solidarity in Activist Politics"], ''Osgoode Hall Law Journal'', Vol. 41, Number 2/3 (Summer/Fall 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The first major indication was in April 2000, when the NGO coalition involved in demonstrations against the World Bank in Washington DC resisted calls by the media to denounce protesters who did not practice strict nonviolence. Spokesperson Nadine Bloch told the press that: "What there was among the protesters [in Seattle] was alternative tactics. Property destruction is something done to things, not to people. I don‘t think that property destruction in the context of [this Washington protest] would be something very constructive. But when we look at what happened in Seattle, we have to say that all of that contributed to the media coverage we got, including those who you might say pushed the envelope."&lt;ref&gt;Marc Cooper, [http://www.laweekly.com/2000-03-30/news/after-seattle/?showFullText=true "After Seattle"], ''LA Weekly'', March 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead up to the protests for the [[3rd Summit of the Americas|2001 Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA) summit in Quebec City, a major direct action organization known as SalAMI suffered a mass defection due to its intolerance of diversity of tactics. Numerous participants (including [[Jaggi Singh (activist)|Jaggi Singh]]) criticized SalAMI for its "dogmatism on nonviolence" as well as perceived hierarchies within the organization. Out of this schism emerged [[Anti-Capitalist Convergence|le Convergence des luttes Anti-Capitalistes]] (CLAC). CLAC's "Basis of Unity" stated: "Respecting a diversity of tactics, the CLAC supports the use of a variety of creative initiatives, ranging from popular education to direct action." The anti-FTAA demonstrations were massive, involving sixty thousand people at its peak, and received largely positive media coverage, even as they included widespread clashes with police and destruction of government property. [[Cindy Milstein]] observed that CLACs success in Quebec City sprang from using a broad repertoire that encompassed community organizing, international outreach and forceful confrontation&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Milstein, [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/27d/055.html "Something Did Start in Quebec City: North America’s Revolutionary Anti-Capitalist Movement"], Institute for Social Ecology, June 13, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (CLAC continue to be active in Quebec to this day, and composed part of the radical flank of [[Quebec student protests 2012|the successful tuition-freeze protests of 2012]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Montpetit and Peter Rakobowchuk, [http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/06/07/quebec-student-protest-montreal-formula-one-grand-prix_n_1578734.html "Quebec Student Protest: Montreal Formula One Grand Prix Braces For Disruption"], ''Huffington Post Canada'', June 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Daly, [http://www.torontosun.com/2012/06/06/ultra-left-wing-quebec-group-claims-they-sent-suspicious-packages "Suspicious packages target Quebec politicians, Quebecor Media"], ''Toronto Sun'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peoples Global Action solidified its support for diversity of tactics at this time by dropping the word "non-violent" from its hallmark on civil disobedience. They explained that:

::The problem with the old formulation was first that the word "non-violence" has very different meanings in India (where it means respect for life) and in the West (where it means also respect for private property). This basic misunderstanding has proved quite impossible to correct in media—or indeed in the movement itself. The North American movement felt that the term could be understood to not allow for a diversity of tactics or even contribute to the criminalisation of part of the movement. The Latin American organisations had also objected to the term in their regional conference, saying that a "call to civil disobedience " was clear enough, whereas " non-violence " seemed to imply a rejection of huge parts of the history of resistance of these peoples and was as such badly taken by large parts of the movement…

::In fact, there was always an understanding in PGA that non-violence has to be understood as a guiding principle or ideal which must always be understood relative to the particular political and cultural situation. Actions which are perfectly legitimate in one context can be unnecessarily violent (contributing to brutalise social relations) in another. And vice versa. Precisely to make this clear, the Zapatista army (EZLN) was invited to be among the first generation of convenors. The wording finally found seemed to respect this fundamental stance, since it explicitly advocates MAXIMISING respect for life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/free/pga/hallm.htm “Hallmarks of People’s Global Action (amended at the 3rd PGA conference at Cochamamba, 2001)”.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent scholarship ===
In recent years, numerous academics have addressed diversity of tactics. Eminent sociologist [[Francis Fox Piven]], in analyzing strategies of disruptive protest, wrote that:

::Protest movements may or may not engage in violence against property or persons. Students of American social movements have been very timid about this issue. They tend to ignore episodes of violence that do occur, excluding them by fiat from their definition of social movements. I suspect that they are influenced by their sympathy for…the much-proclaimed "nonviolence" of the civil rights movement… Just as nonviolence can be strategic, so can violence be used strategically, and often defensively to permit the disruptive action, the withdrawal of cooperation, to continue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbzNwRUZeH0C&amp;q=deacons+for+defese#v=onepage&amp;q=nonviolence&amp;f=false Francis Fox Piven, ''Challenging Authority: How Ordinary People Change America'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006), pp. 23-25.]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Piven’s findings affirm that of other social movement scholars, such as [[William Gamson]] and Pamela Oliver. Oliver wrote that, "Today’s young people are generally taught a celebratory history of the civil rights movement…Our young are rarely taught about the riots, and even many academic sources on the Black movement ignore or downplay the riots. It seems as if those who are old enough to remember the riots are trying to forget them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~oliver/PROTESTS/ArticleCopies/OliverRepressionMoby.pdf Pamela E. Oliver-“Political Repression and Crime Control”], ''Mobilization'' 13(1): 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the sociology field itself, however, positive results from the "[[radical flank effect]]" are widely acknowledged. The radical flank effect was first named by Herbert H. Haines in his book ''Black Radicalism and the Civil Rights Mainstream'', where he states that "the turmoil which the militants created was indispensable to black progress and indeed, black radicalization had the net effect of enhancing the bargaining position of mainstream civil rights groups and hastening many of their goals…[this finding] has implications for any social movement which is composed of moderate and radical factions…"&lt;ref&gt;Herbert H. Haines, ''Black Radicals and the Civil Rights Mainstream, 1954-1970'' (University of Tennessee Press, January 1, 1995), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, academic historians have become more forthright about the role of force in the civil rights movement. Scholars such as [[Charles M. Payne]], [[Akinyele Umoja]], and [[Timothy Tyson]] explicated on the utility of militant activity (ranging from armed deterrence to mass rioting) in ending formal segregation in the United States. In his book ''I’ve Got the Light of Freedom'', Payne reflected on the way in which black militancy co-existed with nonviolent ideals:

::At one level, there is something inconsistent about Medgar Evers contemplating guerilla warfare against whites in the Delta and simultaneously believing that he can talk to [whites] long enough to be able to change them. The inconsistency is only apparent, a function of the breadth of social vision some Southern blacks developed. They could, like Malcolm X, contemplate the broadest range of oppositional tactics, but like MLK, they never lost a larger sense of common humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Payne, ''I’ve Got the Light of Freedom:The Organizing Tradition and the Mississippi Freedom Struggle'' (University of California Press, 1995), pp. 313–314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Robin Kelley]] has written that "armed self-defense actually saved lives, reduced terrorist attacks on African American communities, and laid the foundation for unparalleled community solidarity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyupress.org/books/book-details.aspx?bookId=10963#.U1XprsJOVjo “We Will Shoot Back – Reviews”], NYU Press website.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this scholarship has been highly acclaimed, virtually none of its findings have been used in the popular depictions of the movement thus far.&lt;ref&gt;Emilye J.

=== Recent writing ===
In the influential anti-capitalist text ''The Coming Insurrection'', the authors prescribe an armed resistance that nonetheless avoids militarization: "Weapons are necessary: it’s a question of doing everything possible to make using them unnecessary…the prospect of Iraq-style urban guerilla warfare, dragging on with no possibility of taking the offensive, is more to be feared than to be desired. The militarization of civil war is the defeat of insurrection."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tarnac9.wordpress.com/texts/the-coming-insurrection/ The Invisible Committee, The Coming Insurrection (2007).]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Successful examples ==

=== Suffragettes ===
The woman’s rights movement in Britain became increasingly militant in the years leading up to the passage of suffrage. The primary instigator of this tendency was [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]. Pankhurst’s organization, the [[Women’s Social and Political Union]] (WSPU), began disrupting political meetings and practicing nonviolent civil disobedience in 1904. The mainstream media made a distinction between the legalist suffragists and the law-breaking "[[suffragettes]]"; Pankhurst and her followers nonetheless accepted the latter label.&lt;ref&gt;Kira Cochrane, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/29/nine-lessons-suffragettes-feminists “Nine Inspiring Lessons the Suffragettes Can Teach Feminists Today”], ''The Guardian'', May 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1908, WSPU engaged in violent protests: smashing windows, fighting police officers, and eventually committing non-lethal bombings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/suffragettes/8301.shtml “Suffragettes-Winifred Mayo: A Smashing Time in Pall Mall”], BBC Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1912/10/18/archives/mrs-pankhurst-for-more-violence-tells-a-meeting-of-suffragettes-to.html "MRS. PANKHURST FOR MORE VIOLENCE; Tells a Meeting of Suffragettes to 'Smash Everything,' but to Respect Human Life"], ''The New York Times'', October 18, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Pankhurst famously said that a "broken pane of glass is the most valuable argument in modern politics," and considered suffragette struggle a form of "civil war."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2010/11/millbank-property-young-break Laurie Penny “The Power of the Broken Window Pane at Millbank”], ''The New Statesman'', November 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmeline Pankhurst, [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/27/greatspeeches2 “Freedom or Death- Hartford, Connecticut on November 13 1913”], ''The Guardian'', April 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When imprisoned, suffragettes often engaged in [[Hunger strikes|hunger-strikes]], and were the first high-profile group to systematically engage in this tactic, preceding Mohandas Gandhi by a decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-14540696 “Hunger Strikes: What Can They Achieve?”] BBC News, August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Trevor Lloyd wrote that "by [1913] the suffragettes were no longer looking for opportunities for martyrdom. They wanted to fight against society."&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Lloyd, ''Suffragettes International: The Worldwide Campaign for Women’s Rights'' (American Heritage Press, 1971), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; These activities drove away some of their sympathizers, but Pankhurst was unwavering, stating that:

::…if you really want to get anything done, it is not so much a matter of whether you alienate sympathy; sympathy is a very unsatisfactory thing if it is not practical sympathy. It does not matter to the practical suffragist whether she alienates sympathy that was never of any use to her. What she wants is to get something practical done, and whether it is done out of sympathy or whether it is done out of fear…doesn't particularly matter so long as you get it. We had enough of sympathy for fifty years; it never brought us anything, and we would rather have an angry man going to the government and saying, my business is interfered with and I won't submit to its being interfered with any longer because you won't give women the vote, than to have a gentleman come onto our platforms year in and year out and talk about his ardent sympathy with woman’s suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/27/greatspeeches2 “Freedom or Death- Hartford, Connecticut on November 13 1913”.]&lt;/ref&gt;

American feminist [[Alice Paul]] began her activism with WSPU in Britain and participated in destructive protests there, breaking over forty windows by her own account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alicepaul.org/alicep2.htm “Alice Paul Biography-Militant Suffragettes” Alice Paul Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the US, Paul began introducing some suffragette tactics to the feminist movement in her home country. Paul’s organization, the National Women’s Party, was predominantly nonviolent in its activities, but Paul worked in close solidarity with Emmeline Pankhurst until the passage of suffrage, and hosted appearances by Pankhurst in the US on multiple occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/collections/suffrage/nwp/detchron.pdf “Detailed Chronology of National Women’s Party”], Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Harriot Stanton Blanch changed the name of her organization from the Equality League to the Women’s Political Union in order to demonstrate solidarity with the now-violent WSPU.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Carroll Dubois, ''Harriot Stanton Blanch and the Winning of Women’s Suffrage'' (Yale University Press, 1997), pp. 119-120, 138-140.&lt;/ref&gt; In the months prior to the Nineteenth Amendment’s passage, American suffragists experimented with more militant tactics, breaking a window in a struggle with a police officer in October 1918,&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Adams, Michael L. Keene, ''Alice Paul and the American Suffrage Campaign'' (University of Illinois Press, 2008), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and burning the president in effigy in front of the White House in February 1919. In May 1919, President Wilson called a special session of Congress for the suffrage amendment. It passed both houses the following month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/collections/suffrage/nwp/detchron.pdf Library of Congress] chronology.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil rights movement ===
The civil rights movement was not consistently nonviolent in a [[Gandhian]] sense; even during the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] of 1955–1956, most activists, including Martin Luther King Jr., kept arms in their homes. Under the influence of pacifists Bayard Rustin and Glen Smiley, a stricter code of nonviolence took hold in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Clayborne Carson, [http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/kingweb/additional_resources/articles/unexpected_emergence.htm “The Unexpected Emergence of Martin Luther King Jr”], Martin Luther King Jr Research and Education Institute website.&lt;/ref&gt; The period of 1957–1959 was a nadir for the movement: fewer schools were desegregated in the three years following the bus boycott than in the three years prior, and black voter registration and bus desegregation remained stagnant. Activism fell to one of its lowest points of the post-war era, as most African-Americans in the South were terrorized into submission by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Klarman, [http://kcjohnson.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/klarman-article.pdf “How Brown Changed Race Relations: The Backlash Thesis”], ''The Journal of American History'', Vol. 81, No. 1 (June 1994), pp. 89-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William H.

Williams continued to promote armed resistance with his publication ''The Crusader'' and eventually resumed leadership of the Monroe NAACP chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy B.

Although initiated as a nonviolent campaign which would not respond to white violence, in some locations, including Portsmouth Virginia and Chattanooga, Tennessee, blacks forcefully defended themselves against assaults.&lt;ref&gt;Clayborne Carson, ''In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s'' (Harvard University Press, 1981), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert F.

Hurst, [http://www.crmvet.org/nars/hurst.htm “It Was Never About a Hot Dog and a Coke”], Civil Rights Movement Veterans website.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a citywide clash covered nationally as "Axe-handle Saturday" where dozens of blacks and whites were injured in August 1960.

The '''Emblem of Tibet''' is a symbol of the [[Central Tibetan Administration|Tibetan government in exile]]. It combines several elements of the [[flag of Tibet]], with slightly different artistry, and contains many [[Buddhist symbolism|Buddhist symbols]]. Its primary elements are the [[sun]] and [[moon]] above the [[Himalayas]], which represent [[Tibet]], often known as the ''Land Surrounded by Snow Mountains''. On the slopes of the [[mountain]]s stand a pair of [[snowlion|snow lions]]. Held between the two lions is the eight-spoked [[Dharmacakra]], represent the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] of [[Buddhism]]. Inside the wheel, the three-colored swirling [[Gemstone|jewel]] represents [[Buddhist philosophy|the practices of the ten exalted virtues and the 16 humane modes of conduct]]. The inscription on the swirling banner below is as follows:''bod gzhung dga' ldan pho brang phyogs las rnam rgyal'' ("Tibetan Government, [[Ganden Palace]], victorious in all directions".) The Ganden Palace, located in [[Drepung]] monastery was the residence of the Dalai Lamas until the 5th Dalai Lama. After the 5th Dalai Lama had moved to the Potala in the mid 17th century the Tibetan Government created by him in 1642 became known as the "[[Ganden Phodrang]]" Government.

It is the official emblem of the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] [[government-in-exile]] headquartered in [[Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="TibetNetEmblem"&gt;{{cite web

The emblem is often seen printed in black-and-white and [[crimson]]-and-white variants, which is characteristic of the colors commonly seen in [[Buddhist]] iconography and dress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7343">'''Fagging'''  was a traditional practice in British boarding [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|private schools]] (nearly all
"[[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]]" in the English sense) and also many other [[boarding school]]s, whereby younger pupils were required to act as personal servants to the most senior boys.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Fagging |volume=10 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; While domestic servants were common in family households, the custom reflected household task distribution and taught pupils about service from both ends of the relationship very much reminiscent of the relationship between [[squire]] and [[knight]] in the [[Middle Ages]].

Under school rules, fagging might entail harsh discipline and [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] when those were standard practices.  Fagging was sometimes associated with [[sexual abuse]] by those older boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/oct/12/publicschools.schools |title=When I was at school ... |date= 2005-10-12|accessdate=2011-05-26 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of personal fagging faded away during the 1970s and 1980s, but to some degree has been maintained in former colonies or has been replaced by systems which require junior boys to perform tasks for the benefit of the general school community.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
Fagging originated as a structure for maintaining order in boarding schools, when schoolmasters' authority was practically limited to the classroom. [[Thomas Arnold|Dr. Thomas Arnold]], headmaster of [[Rugby School|Rugby]] from 1828 to 1841, defined fagging as the power given by the authorities of the school to the Sixth Form, to be exercised by them over younger boys.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Senior pupils were given both power over and responsibility for the behaviour of younger boys, thus creating a progressive social structure in the house, while teaching both parties something of service, a concept particularly highly valued in Victorian education and society.

Fagging was a fully established system at [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's]], [[Eton College|Eton]], and [[Winchester College|Winchester]] in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; During the nineteenth century, almost all British public schools had a fagging system, and the numerous new boarding schools founded for the children of the British Empire generally adopted the system as a natural reflection of society.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Fagging carried with it well-defined rights and duties on both sides. The senior, sometimes called the '''fag-master''', was the protector of his fags and responsible for their happiness and good conduct.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In case of any problem outside the classroom, such as bullying or injustice, a junior boy's recourse was to him, not to a form master or housemaster, and, except in the gravest cases, all incidents were dealt with by the fag-master on his own responsibility&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (perhaps in consultation with other fag-masters or prefects) and without reporting to masters.

The duties undertaken by fags, the time taken, and their general treatment varied widely. Each school had its own traditions. Until around 1900 a fag's duties might include such humble tasks as blacking boots, brushing clothes and cooking breakfasts, and there was no limit as to hours.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Later, fagging was restricted to such light tasks as running errands, bringing tea to the fag-masters' study and fagging{{clarify|date=May 2015}} at cricket or football.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; At many schools, fag-masters were expected to reward their fags for their efforts at the end of term by giving a monetary 'fag tip'. The 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica]]'' details an evolution of the role at [[Eton College]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

During the late twentieth century, fagging fell out of use, as attitudes to boarding education and child development changed. Despite the reluctance of senior boys who had served their time and expected to enjoy the benefits of the system, between the 1960s and 1980s first the duties became less onerous and then the system was abolished at most major public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[United Press International|UPI]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19770303&amp;id=eKgrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Av0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6967,805109 |title=Eton students want to carry on fagging tradition |newspaper=[[Nashua Telegraph]] |date=1977-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now believed to be obsolete in Great Britain.

A '''false statement''' is a statement that is not true. Although the word ''[[fallacy]]'' is sometimes used as a synonym for ''false statement'', that is not how the word is used in philosophy, mathematics, logic and most formal contexts.

A false statement need not be a [[lie]]. A lie is a statement that is known to be untrue and is used to mislead. A false statement is a statement that is untrue but not necessarily told to mislead, as a statement given by someone who does not know it is untrue.

==Examples of false statements==
;Misleading statement (lie)
John told his little brother that [[sea otters]] aren't mammals, but fish, even though John himself was a [[marine biologist]] and knew otherwise. John simply wanted to see his little brother fail his class report, in order to teach him to begin projects early, which help him develop skills necessary to succeed in life.

;Statement made out of ignorance
James, John's brother, stated in his class report that sea otters were fish. James got an F after his teacher pointed out why that statement was false. James did not know that sea otters were in fact mammals because he heard that sea otters were fish from his older brother John, a marine biologist.

==In law==
In some [[jurisdiction]]s, false statement is a [[crime]] similar to [[perjury]].

===United States===
{{main|Making false statements}}

In U.S. law, a "false statement" generally refers to United States federal false statements statute, contained in {{USC|18|1001}}. Most commonly, prosecutors use this statute to reach cover-up crimes such as [[perjury]], false declarations, and [[obstruction of justice]] and government [[fraud]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Strader | first= Kelly J. | title= Understanding White Collar Crime | edition= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its earliest progenitor was the [[False Claims Act]] of 1863,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubbard v. United States]], {{ussc|514|695|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1934 the [[element (criminal law)|requirement]] of an [[mens rea|intent]] to defraud was eliminated to enforce the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] of 1933 (NIRA) against producers of "hot oil", oil produced in violation of production restrictions established pursuant to the NIRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants= [[:wikisource:United States v. Gilliland|United States v. Gilliland]] | vol= 312 | reporter= US | opinion= 86 | pinpoint= 93-94 | date= 1941 | quote= Legislation had been sought by the Secretary of the Interior to aid the enforcement of laws relating to the functions of the Department of the Interior and, in particular, to the enforcement of regulations under Sec. 9(c) of the [NIRA].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statute criminalizes a government official who "knowingly and willfully":&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|1001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact;&lt;br /&gt;(2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or&lt;br /&gt;(3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1542">'''Figurative Constructivism''' is an art movement that arose principally in Germany. The term was introduced by [[Franz Seiwert]] in 1929 using the phrase "gegenständlichen constructive", and this was subsequently taken up by [[Gerd Arntz]] and then by art historians more generally.&lt;ref name=BB&gt;Benus B. (2013) 'Figurative Constructivism and sociological graphics' in ''Isotype: Design and Contexts 1925-71'' London: Hyphen Press, pp.216-248&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the development of the [[Isotype (picture language)|Isotype]]. As Seiwert wrote "From the expressionist-cubist art-form abstract constructivism was developed, which in turn led into Figurative Constructivism".&lt;ref name=Kap&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kapounová|first1=Eliška|title=Grafická tvorba Augustina Tschinkela v kontextu moderního designu (1928 – 1940)|url=https://is.muni.cz/th/110838/ff_b/bak_Tschinkel_muni.pdf|publisher=Masarykova univerzita|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''a bis z''==
In October 1929 Seiwert, [[Heinrich Hoerle]] and [[Walter Stern (art critic)|Walter Stern]] produced the first issue of ''A bis Z'', subtitled "organ of the progressive artists group". It featured five artists from four towns: Seiwert and Hoerle ([[Cologne]]), [[Augustin Tschinkel]] ([[Prague]]), [[Peter Alma]] [[Amsterdam]] and Arntz ([[Vienna]]).&lt;ref name=BB/&gt; Tschinkel and Alma were both colleagues of Arntz at the [[Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum]] run by [[Otto Neurath]] in Vienna.&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;

A '''footstool''' ('''foot stool''', '''footrest''', '''foot rest''') is a piece of [[furniture]] or a [[support (structure)|support]] used to elevate the [[foot]]. There are two main types of footstool, which can be loosely categorized into those designed for [[comfort]] and those designed for function.&lt;ref&gt;http://bunkbeds.withstairs.com/footstool.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comfort==
This type of footstool is used to provide comfort to a person seated, for example, in a [[chair]] or [[couch|sofa]]. It is typically a short, wide, four-legged [[stool (seat)|stool]]. The top is [[upholstery|upholstered]] and padded in a fabric or [[Hide (skin)|animal hide]], such as leather. This type of footstool is also a type of [[Ottoman (furniture)|ottoman]]. It allows the seated person to rest their feet upon it, supporting the legs at a mostly horizontal level, thus giving rise to the alternate term ''footrest''. High quality footstools are height–adjustable.

==Function==
This type of footstool supports a person's (usually a child's) feet that do not reach the floor when seated. The footstool is placed under the feet of a sitting person so that the person's feet may rest comfortably on it. An example is the type of [[piano]] footstool used in conjunction with a piano [[bench (furniture)|bench]]. It is also used to make the [[blood circulation]] of the body flow more freely when sitting down.

A [[barber chair]] and a [[shoeshiner]] have foot rests. An [[automobile]] typically has a "dummy [[automobile pedal|pedal]]" that acts as a foot rest to discourage "riding the clutch" or "riding the brake". A foot [[wikt:peg|peg]] is another type of foot rest usually on [[BMX bicycle]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, the [[Ford N-Series tractor]], some [[kayak]]s, the [[Impossible wheel]], and other [[Transport|transportation]] devices.

== History ==
Footstools have been known for many years, and have evolved throughout history. The footstool is attested in [[ancient Egypt]], where it was utilized to ascend chairs perched high off the ground. It was also used to rest a person's feet when he or she was seated.

In the 18th century a low, long footstool called a fender stool was popular. It was placed in front of the fireplace, and long enough for all of the family members to place their feet and warm them up.

Footstools where generally interchangeable in everyday life from the 17th through the early 19th century. In early American homes the footstool was very valuable, and took precious space although the living quarters were cramped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.peggymcclard.com/justforfun/details.asp?action=view&amp;cid=10&amp;iid=13|title = Just for Fun - History of Footstools - Peggy McClard Antiques - Americana &amp; Folk Art|last = McClard|first = Peggy|website = www.peggymcclard.com|access-date = 2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with this, the exhibition 'A History of the World' at Mevagissey Museum showed an emigrant's footstool which was made by an emigrant from Cornwall in North America sometime around 1850's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/SI0XOf4rSY-tUzLn6ZgoEA|title = BBC - A History of the World - Object : Emigrant's foot stool|website = www.bbc.co.uk|access-date = 2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Hebraist''' is a specialist in [[Jewish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Hebraic]] studies. Specifically, British and German scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries who were involved in the study of Hebrew language and literature were commonly known by this designation, at a time when Hebrew was little understood outside practicing Jewish communities.

The 18th-century British academy was rife with pseudo-scholars, mystics, and "enthusiasts" interested in the Hebrew language for diverse and polemical reasons. The linguistic and historical advances brought by the discovery of Sanskrit, the putative deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphics by some scholars, and archaeological insights into the ancient Near East, brought major sea-changes in the scholarly understanding of Biblical history. Interest in the Hebrew language intensified as debates raged about whether there was a historical flood of Noah, and whether Hebrew was the most ancient language in the world, taught by God to Adam. Historical linguistic scholarship led the way in these debates. Some Hebraists had posts in academies or churches, while others were strictly amateur.

Some Hebraists proposed theories that the vowels in the text of the Hebrew Bible, superadded to the text by the scribal tradition, were a Jewish conspiracy to mask the true meaning of Scripture. As a result, a genre of Hebraic scholarship concentrated on running the words of the Biblical text together, removing the vowels, dissecting the words in different ways, and adding alternate vowels so as to give an alternate sense to the text.

The '''Hunminjeongeum Society''', sometimes called the "Hunminjeongeum Research Institute" in English-language newspaper accounts, is a private organization in [[Seoul]] dedicated to the propagation of [[hangul]] to all the unwritten languages of the world.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/world/asia/12script.html South Korea's Latest Export: Its Alphabet]", ''[[New York Times]],'' 2009 Sept. 11&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Hunminjeongeum]]'' was the original name of hangul.) The society was founded by [[Lee Ki-nam]], a retired real-estate agent, in 2007, after she had failed to bring hangul to the Tungusic [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] of [[Heilongjiang]], China; the [[Chepang people|Chepang]] of Nepal; and the [[Lahu people|Lahu]] of [[Chiang Mai]], Thailand; she attributed these failures to a reliance on Korean Christian missionaries in those countries, whose primary focus was not linguistics or literacy.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; 

As of 2015, the society is chaired by linguistics professor [[Kim Ju-won]] of [[Seoul National University]], and its current focus is on countries that send large numbers of people to work in Korea. In 2009 it succeeded in getting the city of [[Bau-Bau]], on [[Buton Island]] in [[Sulawesi]], Indonesia, to adopt hangul for the [[Cia-Cia language]]. The society has published a series of hangul Cia-Cia textbooks for use in schools, using an orthography designed by Kim,&lt;ref name=joongang&gt;"[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2910271 Teachers to spread the word about Hangul]", ''JoongAng Ilbo,'' 2009 Sept. 19&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2012 it was reported that adoption ultimately failed and has been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/10/10/2011101001151.html "Adoption of Hangeul by Indonesian Tribe Hits Snag",] ''The chosunibo''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ido''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|d|oʊ}} is a [[constructed language]], derived from [[Reformed Esperanto]], created to be a [[international auxiliary language|universal second language]] for speakers of diverse backgrounds. Ido was specifically designed to be [[Grammar|grammatically]], [[Orthography|orthographically]], and [[Lexicon|lexicographically]] regular, and above all easy to learn and use. In this sense, Ido is classified as a constructed [[international auxiliary language]]. It is the most successful of many Esperanto derivatives, called [[Esperantido]]s.

Ido was created in 1907 out of a desire to reform perceived flaws in [[Esperanto]], a language that had been created 20 years earlier to facilitate international communication. The name of the language traces its origin to the Esperanto word ''{{wikteo|ido}}'', meaning "offspring",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Esperanto-English Dictionary
|url=http://esperanto-panorama.net/vortaro/eo-en-u.htm#I
|accessdate=12 February 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the language is a "descendant" of Esperanto. After its inception, Ido gained support from some in the Esperanto community, but following the sudden death in 1914 of one of its most influential proponents, [[Louis Couturat]], it declined in popularity. There were two reasons for this: first, the emergence of further schisms arising from competing reform projects; and second, a general lack of awareness of Ido as a candidate for an international language. These obstacles weakened the movement and it was not until the rise of the Internet that it began to regain momentum.

Ido uses the same 26 letters as the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|English (Latin) alphabet]], with no [[diacritic]]s. It draws its vocabulary from English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese, and is largely intelligible to those who have studied Esperanto.

Several works of literature have been translated into Ido, including ''[[The Little Prince]]'' and the [[Gospel of Luke]]. As of the year 2000, there were approximately 100–200 Ido speakers in the world.&lt;ref name="Blanke"/&gt;

==History==
The idea of a universal second language is not new, and constructed languages are not a recent phenomenon. The first known constructed language was [[Lingua Ignota]], created in the 12th century. But the idea did not catch on in large numbers until the language [[Volapük]] was created in 1879. Volapük was popular for some time and apparently had a few thousand users, but was later eclipsed by the popularity of [[Esperanto]], which arose in 1887. Several other languages such as [[Latino sine flexione|Latino sine Flexione]] and [[Idiom Neutral]] had also been put forward. It was during this time that French mathematician [[Louis Couturat]] formed the ''[[Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language]]''.

This delegation made a formal request to the [[International Association of Academies]] in [[Vienna]] to select and endorse an international language; the request was rejected in May 1907.&lt;ref name="Guérard"&gt;{{cite book

|title=A Short History of the International Language Movement
|chapter=Chapter VII
|url=http://donh.best.vwh.net/Languages/delegation.html
|accessdate=12 February 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Delegation then met as a Committee in Paris in October 1907 to discuss the adoption of a standard international language. Among the languages considered was a new language anonymously submitted at the last moment (and therefore against the Committee rules) under the pen name ''Ido''.&lt;ref name="Dyer"&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=12 February 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end the Committee, always without plenary sessions and consisting of only 12 members, concluded the last day with 4 votes for and 1 abstention. They concluded that no language was completely acceptable, but that Esperanto could be accepted "on condition of several modifications to be realized by the permanent Commission in the direction defined by the conclusions of the Report of the Secretaries [Louis Couturat and [[Léopold Leau]]] and by the Ido project".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Ido Kongreso en Dessau 1922.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The International Ido Congress in [[Dessau]], Germany, in 1922]]

Esperanto's inventor, [[L. L. Zamenhof]], having heard a number of complaints, had suggested in 1894 a proposal for a [[Reformed Esperanto]] with several changes that Ido adopted and made it closer to French: eliminating the accented letters and the accusative case, changing the plural to an Italianesque ''-i'', and replacing the table of correlatives with more Latinate words. However, the Esperanto community voted and rejected Reformed Esperanto,&lt;ref name="Dyer"/&gt; and likewise most rejected the recommendations of the 1907 Committee composed by 12 members. Zamenhof deferred to their judgment, although doubtful. Furthermore, controversy ensued when the "Ido project" was found to have been primarily devised by [[Louis de Beaufront]], whom  Zamenhof had chosen to represent Esperanto before the Committee, as the Committee's rules dictated that the creator of a submitted language could not defend it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee's language was French and not everyone could speak in French. When the president of the Committee asked who was the author of Ido's project, Couturat, Beaufront and Leau answered that they were not. Beaufront was the person who presented Ido's project and gave a description as a better, richer version of Esperanto. Couturat, Leau, Beaufront and Jespersen were finally the only members who voted, all of them for Ido's project. A month later, Couturat accidentally put Jespersen in a copy of a letter in which he acknowledged that Beaufront was the author of the Ido project. Jespersen was angered by this and asked for a public confession, which was never forthcoming.

It is estimated that some 20% of Esperanto leaders and 3–4% of ordinary Esperantists defected to Ido, which from then on suffered constant modifications seeking to perfect it, but which ultimately had the effect of causing many Ido speakers to give up on trying to learn it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it fractured the Esperanto movement, the schism gave the remaining Esperantists the freedom to concentrate on using and promoting their language as it stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it gave the Idists freedom to continue working on their own language for several more years before actively promoting it. The ''Uniono di la Amiki di la Linguo Internaciona'' (''Union of Friends of the International Language'') was established along with an Ido Academy to work out the details of the new language.&lt;ref name="Dyer"/&gt;

Couturat, who was the leading proponent of Ido, was killed in an automobile accident in 1914.&lt;ref name="Dyer"/&gt; This, along with [[World War I]], practically suspended the activities of the Ido Academy from 1914 to 1920.&lt;ref name="Guérard"/&gt; In 1928 Ido's major intellectual supporter, the Danish linguist [[Otto Jespersen]], published his own planned language, [[Novial]]. His defection from the Ido movement set it back even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Digital era===
The language still has active speakers today, and the Internet has sparked a renewal of interest in the language in recent years. A sample of 24 Idists on the [[Yahoo!]] group ''Idolisto'' during November 2005 showed that 57% had begun their studies of the language during the preceding three years, 32% from the mid-1990s to 2002, and 8% had known the language from before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Phonology==
Ido has five vowel [[phoneme]]s. The vowels {{IPAlink|e||[}} and {{IPAlink|ɛ||[}} are interchangeable depending on speaker preference, as are {{IPAlink|o||[}} and {{IPAlink|ɔ||[}}. The combinations /au/ and /eu/ become [[diphthong]]s in word roots but not when adding affixes.&lt;ref name="KGD7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ido-vivo.info/kgd.pdf#page=7 |title=Pronunco dil vokali |work=Kompleta Gramatiko detaloza di la linguo internaciona Ido |date=2004 |page=7 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813213123/http://ido-vivo.info/kgd.pdf#page=7 |archive-date=13 August 2015 |dead-url=no |first=Louis |last=De Beaufront |editor-first=Fernando |editor-last=Tejón |language=io |publisher=Krayono |location=Ponferrada, Spain |orig-year=1st pub. 1925 |format=PDF |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All polysyllabic words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable except for verb [[infinitive]]s, which are stressed on the last syllable{{spnd}}'''sko'''lo, ka'''fe'''o and '''ler'''nas for "school", "coffee" and the present tense of "to learn", but i'''rar''', sa'''var''' and drin'''kar''' for "to go", "to know" and "to drink". If an '''i''' or '''u''' precedes another vowel, the pair is considered part of the same syllable when applying the accent rule{{spnd}}thus '''ra'''dio, fa'''mi'''lio and '''ma'''nuo for "radio", "family" and "hand", unless the two vowels are the only ones in the word, in which case the "i" or "u" is stressed: '''di'''o, '''fru'''a for "day" and "early".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Grammar==
Each word in the Ido vocabulary is built from a root word. A word consists of a root and a grammatical ending. Other words can be formed from that word by removing the grammatical ending and adding a new one, or by inserting certain [[affix]]es between the root and the grammatical ending.

Some of the grammatical endings are defined as follows:

{| class="wikitable"

 | colspan=2 | '''-u''' (iru)
|-
! [[Conditional mood|Conditional]]
| '''-us''' (irus)
 | colspan=2 | would go
 | colspan=2 | '''-us''' (irus)
|}

These are the same as in Esperanto except for ''-i'', ''-ir'', ''-ar'', ''-or'' and ''-ez''. Esperanto marks noun plurals by an ''agglutinative'' ending ''-j'' (so plural nouns end in ''-oj''), uses ''-i'' for verb infinitives (Esperanto infinitives are tenseless), and uses ''-u'' for the imperative. Verbs in Ido, as in Esperanto, do not conjugate depending on person, number or gender; the -'''as''', -'''is''', and -'''os''' endings suffice whether the subject is I, you, he, she, they, or anything else.

===Syntax===
Ido word order is generally the same as English ([[subject–verb–object]]), so the sentence ''Me havas la blua libro'' is the same as the English "I have the blue book", both in meaning and word order. There are a few differences, however:
* Adjectives can precede the noun as in English, or follow the noun as in Spanish. Thus, ''Me havas la libro blua'' means the same thing.
* Ido has the [[accusative]] suffix ''-n''. Unlike Esperanto, this suffix is only required when the object of the sentence is not clear, for example, when the subject-verb-object word order is not followed. Thus, ''La blua libron me havas'' also means the same thing.

Ido generally does not impose rules of grammatical [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between grammatical categories within a sentence. For example, the verb in a sentence is invariable regardless of the number and person of the subject. Nor must the adjectives be pluralized as well the nouns{{spnd}}in Ido ''the large books'' would be ''la granda libri'' as opposed to the French ''les grands livres'' or the Esperanto ''la grandaj libroj''.

Negation occurs in Ido by simply adding '''ne''' before a verb: '''Me ne havas libro''' means "I do not have a book". This as well does not vary, and thus the "I do not", "He does not", "They do not" before a verb are simply '''Me ne''', '''Il ne''', and '''Li ne'''. In the same way, past tense and future tense negatives are formed by '''ne''' before the conjugated verb. "I will not go" and "I did not go" become '''Me ne iros''' and '''Me ne iris''' respectively.

Yes/no questions are formed by the particle '''ka''' in front of the question. "I have a book" (me havas libro) becomes '''Ka me havas libro?''' (do I have a book?). '''Ka''' can also be placed in front of a noun without a verb to make a simple question, corresponding to the English "is it?" '''Ka Mark?''' can mean, "Are you Mark?", "Is it Mark?", "Do you mean Mark?" depending on the context.

===Pronouns===
The [[pronoun]]s of Ido were revised to make them more acoustically distinct than those of Esperanto, which all end in ''i''. Especially the singular and plural first-person pronouns ''mi'' and ''ni'' may be difficult to distinguish in a noisy environment, so Ido has ''me'' and ''ni'' instead. Ido also distinguishes between [[T-V distinction|intimate (''tu'') and formal (''vu'')]] second-person singular pronouns as well as plural second-person pronouns (''vi'') not marked for intimacy. Furthermore, Ido has a pan-gender third-person pronoun ''lu'' (it can mean "he", "she", or "it", depending on the context) in addition to its masculine (''il''), feminine (''el''), and neuter (''ol'') third-person pronouns.

# ''ci'', although technically the familiar form of the word "you" in Esperanto, is seldom used. Esperanto's inventor himself did not include the pronoun in the first book on Esperanto and only later reluctantly; later he recommended against using ''ci'' because different cultures have conflicting traditions regarding the use of the familiar and formal forms of "you".&lt;ref&gt;Eventoj, no. 103, {{ISSN|1215-959X}}. ''Ci'' estas senvalora balasto (''Ci'' is useless ballast). 1996. Available at http://www.eventoj.hu/arkivo/eve-103.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that ''ol'', like English ''it'' and Esperanto ''ĝi'', is not limited to inanimate objects, but can be used "for entities whose sex is indeterminate: ''babies, children, humans, youths, elders, people, individuals, horses, [cattle], cats,'' etc."

''Lu'' is often mistakenly labeled an [[epicene]] pronoun, that is, one that refers to both masculine and feminine beings, but in fact, ''lu'' is more properly a "pan-gender" pronoun, as it is also used for referring to inanimate objects. From ''Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza di la Linguo Internaciona Ido'' by Beaufront:

{{quote|
''Lu'' (like ''li'') is used ''for all three genders.'' That ''lu'' does duty for the three genders at will in the singular is not in itself any more astonishing than seeing ''li'' serve the three genders at will in the plural ... By a decision (1558) the Idist Academy rejected every restriction concerning the use of ''lu.'' One may thus use that pronoun in exactly the same way for a thing and a person of obvious sex as for animals of unknown sex and a person that has a genderless name, like ''baby, child, human,'' etc., these being as truly masculine as feminine.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The motives for this decision were given in "Mondo", XI, 68: ''Lu'' for the singular is exactly the same as ''li'' for the plural. Logic, symmetry and ease demand this. Consequently, just as ''li'' may be used for people, animals, and things whenever nothing obliges one to express the gender, so ''lu'' may be used for people, animals, and things under the same condition. The proposed distinction would be a bothersome subtlety&amp;nbsp;...

Ido makes correlatives by combining entire words together and changing the word ending, with some irregularities to show distinction.

# The initial ''i'' can be omitted: ''ta'', ''to'', ''ti'', ''ta''.
# One can omit the initial ''a'': ''ultempe'', ''nultempe'', ''ulspeca'', ''nulspeca'', ''ulmaniere'', ''nulmaniere''.
# ''omnatempe'' is correct and usable, but ''sempre'' is the actual word.
# Instead of ''irga quanto'', ''nula quanto'' and ''la tota quanto'' one usually says ''irgo'', ''nulo'' and ''omno''.
{{anchor|Compounds formation}}
===Compound formation===

Composition in Ido obeys stricter rules than in Esperanto, especially formation of
nouns, adjectives and verbs from a radical of a different
class.  The reversibility principle assumes that for each composition rule (affix addition), the corresponding decomposition rule (affix removal) is valid.

Hence, while in Esperanto an adjective (for instance {{lang|eo|papera}}, formed on the noun radical {{lang|eo|paper(o}), can mean an attribute ({{lang|eo|papera enciklopedio}} “paper-made encyclopedia”) and a relation ({{lang|eo|papera fabriko}} “paper-making factory”), Ido will distinguish  the attribute {{lang|eo|papera}} (“paper” or “of paper” (not “paper-made” exactly)) from the relation {{lang|eo|paper'''al'''a}} (“paper-making”).

Similarily, {{lang|eo|krono}} means in both Esperanto and Ido the noun “crown”; where Esperanto allows formation of “to crown” by simply changing the ending from noun to verb {{lang|eo|kroni}} (“crowning” is {{lang|eo|kronado}}), Ido requires an affix so the composition is reversible: {{lang|eo|kron'''iz'''ar}} (“the act of crowning” is {{lang|eo|kron'''iz'''o}}).

According to [[Claude Piron]], some modifications brought by Ido are in practice impossible to use and ruin spontaneous expression: &lt;blockquote&gt;Ido displays, on linguistic level, other drawbacks Esperanto succeeded to avoid, but I don’t have at hand documents which would allow me to go further in detail.  For instance, if I remember correctly, where Esperanto only has the suffix {{lang|eo|-igi}}*, Ido has several: *{{lang|io|-ifar}}*, *{{lang|io|-izar}}*, *{{lang|io|-igar}}*, which match subtleties which were meant to make language clearer, but that, in practice, inhibit natural expression.&lt;ref&gt;http://claudepiron.free.fr/lettresouvertes/ido.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Vocabulary in Ido is derived from French, Italian, Spanish, English, German, and Russian. Basing the vocabulary on various widespread languages was intended to make Ido as easy as possible for the greatest number of people possible. Early on, the first 5,371 Ido word roots were analyzed compared to the vocabulary of the six source languages, and the following result was found:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2024 roots (38%) belong to 6 languages
* 942 roots (17%) belong to 5 languages
* 1111 roots (21%) belong to 4 languages
* 585 roots (11%) belong to 3 languages
* 454 roots (8%) belong to 2 languages
* 255 roots (5%) belong to 1 language

Another analysis showed that:

* 4880 roots (91%) are found in French
* 4454 roots (83%) are found in Italian
* 4237 roots (79%) are found in Spanish
* 4219 roots (79%) are found in English
* 3302 roots (61%) are found in German
* 2821 roots (52%) are found in Russian

Vocabulary in Ido is often created through a number of official prefixes and suffixes that alter the meaning of the word. This allows a user to take existing words and modify them to create [[neologism]]s when necessary, and allows for a wide range of expression without the need to learn new vocabulary each time. Though their number is too large to be included in one article, some examples include:
*The diminutive suffix '''-et-'''. '''Domo''' (house) becomes '''dometo''' (cottage), and '''libro''' (book) becomes '''libreto''' (novelette or short story).
*The pejorative suffix '''-ach-'''. '''Domo''' becomes '''domacho''' (hovel), and '''libro''' becomes '''libracho''' (a shoddy piece of work, pulp fiction, etc.)
*The prefix '''retro-''', which implies a reversal. '''Irar''' (to go) becomes '''retroirar''' (to go back, backward) and '''venar''' (to come) becomes '''retrovenar''' (to return).

New vocabulary is generally created through an analysis of the word, its [[etymology]], and reference to the six source languages. If a word can be created through vocabulary already existing in the language then it will usually be adopted without need for a new radical (such as '''wikipedio''' for ''Wikipedia'', which consists of '''wiki''' + '''enciklopedio''' for ''encyclopedia''), and if not an entirely new word will be created. The word '''alternatoro''' for example was adopted in 1926, likely because five of the six source languages used largely the same [[orthography]] for the word, and because it was long enough to avoid being mistaken for other words in the existing vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://interlanguages.net/nova.html
|title=Lexiko di nova vorti
|trans-title=Lexicon of new words
|author=De Cock, Camiel
|year=1988
|accessdate=19 January 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption of a word is done through consensus, after which the word will be made official by the [[Uniono por la Linguo Internaciona Ido|union]]. Care must also be taken to avoid [[homonym]]s if possible, and usually a new word undergoes some discussion before being adopted. Foreign words that have a restricted sense and are not likely to be used in everyday life (such as the word ''[[intifada]]'' to refer to [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|the conflict]] between [[Israel]] and [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]]) are left untouched, and often written in italics.

Ido, unlike Esperanto, does not assume the male sex by default. For example, Ido does not derive the word for “waitress” by adding a feminine suffix to “waiter”, as Esperanto does. Instead, Ido words are defined as [[Neuter (grammar)|sex-neutral]], and two different suffixes derive masculine and feminine words from the root: ''{{lang|io|servisto}}'' for a waiter of either sex, ''{{lang|io|servistulo}}'' for a male waiter, and ''{{lang|io|servistino}}'' for a waitress. There are only two exceptions to this rule:&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt; First, ''{{lang|io|patro}}'' for “father”, ''{{lang|io|matro}}'' for “mother”, and ''{{lang|io|genitoro}}'' for “parent”, and second, ''{{lang|io|viro}}'' for “man”, ''{{lang|io|muliero}}'' for “woman”, and ''{{lang|io|adulto}}'' for “adult”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://idomondo.org/skolo.1.6.pdf#page=42 |title=Ido for All |date=2008 |pages=42,&amp;nbsp;52,&amp;nbsp;70 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125103925/http://idomondo.org/skolo.1.6.pdf#page=42 |archive-date=25 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |first1=Niklas |last1=ApGawain |first2=P.&amp;nbsp;D. |last2=Hugon |first3=J.&amp;nbsp;L. |last3=Moore |first4=Louis |last4=De Beaufront |editor-first=Jerry |editor-last=Muelver |publisher=North American Ido Society |edition=1.6 |orig-year=1st pub. 1999 |format=PDF |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and publications==
Ido has a number of publications that can be subscribed to or downloaded for free in most cases. ''Kuriero Internaciona'' is a magazine produced in France every few months with a range of topics. ''Adavane!'' is a magazine produced by the Spanish Ido Society every two months that has a range of topics, as well as a few dozen pages of work translated from other languages. ''Progreso'' is the official organ of the Ido movement and has been around since the inception of the movement in 1908. Other sites can be found with various stories, fables or proverbs along with a few books of the Bible translated into Ido on a smaller scale. The site ''publikaji'' has a few podcasts in Ido along with various songs and other recorded material.

[[Wikipedia]] includes an [http://io.wikipedia.org/ Ido-language edition] (known in Ido as ''Wikipedio''); in January 2012 it was the 81st most visited Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers''' (also known as '''IncSoc''', '''Inc Soc''' and '''ISFLD''') was a membership organisation founded in 1942 to promote the British fashion and textile industry and create luxury couture to sell abroad for the [[World War II|war effort]].&lt;ref name="Byrne2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Byrne|first=Robert|title=Style City: How London Became a Fashion Capital|year=2009|publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd|isbn=0711228957|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to build the relationship between government and fashion industry and represent the interests of London couturiers. The organisation continued after the war and sought to present itself as an alternative to the revived Paris couture industry.

==Establishment==
Some sources suggest Inc Soc was established by Harry Yoxall, managing editor of ''[[Vogue (British magazine)|British Vogue]]'',&lt;ref name="Byrne2009" /&gt; and others indicate it was the idea of Sir Cecil Weir of the Board of Trade.&lt;ref name="costumesociety"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ness|first=Caroline|author2=Brooks, Mary M.|title=Rediscovering Mattli: A Forgotten 1950s London Couturier|url=http://costumesociety.org.uk/journal/costume-number-45-2011|journal=Costume|year=2011|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernestine Carter]] states that the IncSoc had its origins in 1941 with an export collection sent to South America by the British Colour Council, designed by Charles Creed (at [[Fortnum &amp; Mason]]), Norman Hartnell, Edward Molyneux, Digby Morton, Peter Russell, Victor Stiebel (of Jacqmar) and Worth London.&lt;ref name=ernestine/&gt; Along with Bianca Mosca and Hardy Amies, all would go on to be founder-members of the IncSoc the following year, except Creed, who was the first designer voted in as a member.&lt;ref name=ernestine/&gt;

In March 1942, on the invitation of the [[Board of Trade]], the members of Inc Soc – all of whom were used to custom-creating designs for customers – designed 34 [[utility clothing]] garments suitable for mass manufacture in order to demonstrate how high-fashion elegance could be achieved within the strict rationing restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breward|first=Christopher|title=Fashioning London: Clothing and the Modern Metropolis|year=2004|publisher=Berg|isbn=1859737927|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the Couturier Scheme, the project had a very high profile in the press at the time with a fashion show held to launch the clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Attfield|first=Judy|title=Utility Reassessed: The Role of Ethics in the Practice of Design|year=1999|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719058449|pages=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype models were featured in ''Vogue'' magazine and donated to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] later that year.&lt;ref name=victor&gt;{{cite book|last=de la Haye|first=Amy|title=The Englishness of English Dress |year=2002|publisher=Berg|isbn=1859735282|pages=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtMnFtUIAKwC&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=%22incorporated%20Society%20of%20London%20Fashion%20Designers%20%22&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q=%22incorporated%20Society%20of%20London%20Fashion%20Designers%20%22&amp;f=false|editor=Breward, Christopher |editor2=Conekin, Becky E. |editor3=Cox, Caroline |chapter=Brocaded evening gowns and impeccable tailoring: Victor Stiebel - a quintessentially English designer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utility Collection of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers, 1942|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?slug=incorporated-society-of-london-fashion-designers&amp;name=4532&amp;limit=45&amp;offset=0|publisher=V&amp;A|accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war activities==
Inc Soc had organised seasonal showings in each London couture house based on the Parisian couture system. After the war, Inc Soc coordinated spring and autumn collections in London with the [[Fédération française de la couture|Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture]] in Paris to allow cash-rich overseas buyers to take in both cities' collections.

In 1949, members of Inc Soc showcased British fashion in the film ''[[Maytime in Mayfair]]'' in a sequence that showed models wearing an outfit by each of the ten member designers.&lt;ref name="BFI Maytime"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maytime in Mayfair (1949)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/516661/credits.html|website=screenonline.org.uk|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1968, [[The Guardian]] reported that although associate membership for makers of hats, gloves, shoes and other accessories had been wound up, the society continued with Edward Rayne as chairman and Lady Hartwell (previously Lady Pamela Berry) as president.&lt;ref name="The Inc Soc, Guardian 050768"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Inc. Soc.|agency=ProQuest Historical Newspapers|publisher=The Guardian|date=5 July 1968|ref=pg. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CR Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Maris|title=British designers discount foreign clothing interests|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/iowa/cedar-rapids/cedar-rapids-gazette/1969/01-03/page-20|accessdate=13 September 2014|publisher=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=3 January 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1969, IncSoc was reported to be struggling due to high taxes and overheads and competition from London's booming ready-to-wear designers. Most had added ready-to-wear designs to shore up their businesses.&lt;ref name="CR Gazette"/&gt; In January that year the society – which had shrunk from 12 to seven members over the previous six years – announced it would no longer host a group fashion event for UK and international buyers. Instead, each designer would host an individual show.&lt;ref name="CR Gazette"/&gt; The organisation was still extant in 1974, but disbanded soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=ernestine/&gt;

==Membership==
The founding members were nicknamed the "Big Eight" in the press of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Settle|first=Allison|title=Can It Become a World Fashion Centre?|journal=Picture Post|date=6 January 1945|url=http://find.galegroup.com/pipo/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=PIPO&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=EL1800004067&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1949 they had become the "Big Ten" or "Top Ten of Fashion".&lt;ref name="costumesociety" /&gt; The fashion journalist [[Ernestine Carter]] recalled in 1974: "At one point we called them the Top Ten, another the First Eleven, once the Baker's Dozen, then a Rowing Eight. Finally, we stopped giving them numbers at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Ernestine |title=With tongue in chic |date=1974 |publisher=Joseph |location=London |isbn=0718112989|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each new member needed to receive the votes of at least two-thirds of the existing members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who Buys Our Best Clothes?|journal=Picture Post|date=5 March 1949|pages=13|url=http://find.galegroup.com/pipo/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=PIPO&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=EL1800096975&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|location=London, England}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, the designer had to have shown at least four collections before being considered for membership, although some later members achieved this faster, due to the strength of their work.&lt;ref name="SMH 30081964"&gt;{{cite news|last1=from our own correspondent|title=Immortals|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19640830&amp;id=6oRWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w-UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6233,10675548|accessdate=19 September 2014|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 August 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kinetoscope.jpg|thumb|right|Interior view of Kinetoscope with peephole viewer at top of cabinet]]
The '''Kinetoscope''' is an [[History of film#Precursors of film|early motion picture]] exibition device. The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a [[peephole]] viewer window at the top of the device. The Kinetoscope was not a [[movie projector]], but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of [[video]], by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of [[film perforations|perforated film]] bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor [[Louis Le Prince]], the concept was also used by U.S. inventor [[Thomas Edison]] in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee [[William Kennedy Laurie Dickson]] between 1889 and 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-the-kinetoscope-1992032|title=The Kinetoscope|author=Bellis, Mary|publisher=[[ThoughtCo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the '''Kinetograph''', an innovative [[movie camera|motion picture camera]] with rapid [[intermittent movement|intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement]], to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.

A prototype for the Kinetoscope was shown to a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891.&lt;ref name="memory.loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|website=Memory.loc.gov|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmvhist.html|title=Inventing Entertainment: The Early Motion Pictures and Sound Recordings of the Edison Companies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope was held at the [[Brooklyn Museum|Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences]] on May 9, 1893.&lt;ref name="memory.loc.gov"/&gt; Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international [[patents]] on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the '''Kinetophone''', which joined the Kinetoscope with a [[phonograph cylinder|cylinder]] [[phonograph]]. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.

==Development==
[[File:MonkeyshinesStrip.jpg|thumb|right|Sheet of images from one of the three ''[[Monkeyshines, No. 1|Monkeyshines]]'' films (ca. 1889–90) produced as tests of an early version of the Kinetoscope]]
An encounter with the work and ideas of photographic pioneer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] appears to have spurred Edison to pursue the development of a motion picture system. On February 25, 1888, in [[Kaust, Kentucky]], Muybridge gave a lecture that may have included a demonstration of his [[zoopraxiscope]], a device that projected sequential images drawn around the edge of a glass disc, producing the illusion of motion. The Edison facility was very close by, and the lecture was possibly attended by both Edison and his company's official photographer, William Dickson. Two days later, Muybridge and Edison met at Edison's laboratory in [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]]; Muybridge later described how he proposed a collaboration to join his device with the Edison phonograph—a combination system that would play sound and images concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;See Hendricks (1961), pp. 11–12, for support of Muybridge's description, particularly the reference to statements by Edison that appeared in the ''[[New York World]]'', June 3, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; No such collaboration was undertaken, but in October 1888, Edison filed a preliminary claim, known as a caveat, with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] announcing his plans to create a device that would do "for the Eye what the phonograph does for the Ear". It is clear that it was intended as part of a complete audiovisual system: "we may see &amp; hear a whole Opera as perfectly as if actually present".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Robinson (1997), who gives the date of the filing as October 17 (p. 23). Braun (1992) reports it as October 8 (p. 188).&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1889, a second caveat was filed, in which the proposed motion picture device was given a name, Kinetoscope, derived from the Greek roots ''[[wikt:κίνησις|kineto-]]'' ("movement") and ''[[wikt:σκοπός|scopos]]'' ("to view").&lt;ref&gt;Musser (2004), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison assigned Dickson, one of his most talented employees, to the job of making the Kinetoscope a reality. Edison would take full credit for the invention, but the historiographical consensus is that the title of creator can hardly go to one man:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
While Edison seems to have conceived the idea and initiated the experiments, Dickson apparently performed the bulk of the experimentation, leading most modern scholars to assign Dickson with the major credit for turning the concept into a practical reality. The Edison laboratory, though, worked as a collaborative organization. Laboratory assistants were assigned to work on many projects while Edison supervised and involved himself and participated to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmvhist.html#O History of Edison Motion Pictures: The Kinetoscope] part of the Library of Congress/''Inventing Entertainment'' educational website. Retrieved 10/22/06.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dickson and his then lead assistant, Charles Brown, made halting progress at first. Edison's original idea involved recording pinpoint photographs, 1/32 of an inch wide, directly on to a cylinder (also referred to as a "drum"); the cylinder, made of an opaque material for positive images or of glass for negatives, was coated in [[collodion]] to provide a photographic base.&lt;ref&gt;Braun (1992), pp. 188, 404 n. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; An audio cylinder would provide synchronized sound, while the rotating images, hardly operatic in scale, were viewed through a microscope-like tube. When tests were made with images expanded to a mere 1/8 of an inch in width, the coarseness of the [[silver halide|silver bromide]] [[photographic film|emulsion]] used on the cylinder became unacceptably apparent. Around June 1889, the lab began working with sensitized [[celluloid#Photography|celluloid]] sheets, supplied by John Carbutt, that could be wrapped around the cylinder, providing a far superior base for the recording of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Rossell (1998), pp. 63–64; Braun (1992), pp. 189, 404 n. 47. Robinson (1997) says the lab ordered the Carbutt sheets on June 25, 1889, and that they were "marketed in 20" x 50"" size. (p. 27). Spehr (2000) says (a) the lab received them on that date, (b) they were "11 by 14" inches in size (a figure with which Braun, op. cit., agrees), (c) sheets from another supplier, Allen &amp; Rowell, arrived on the same date, and (d) sheets from yet another source had been received in May. It was Carbutt's sheets, according to Spehr's report of Dickson's recollections, that were used in the cylinder experiments (p. 23 n. 22).&lt;/ref&gt; The first film made for the Kinetoscope, and apparently the first motion picture ever produced on photographic film in the United States, may have been shot at this time (there is an unresolved debate over whether it was made in June 1889 or November 1890); known as ''[[Monkeyshines, No. 1]]'', it shows an employee of the lab in an apparently tongue-in-cheek display of physical dexterity.&lt;ref&gt;There is also a question about which Edison employee appears in the film. If the earlier date is correct, it is John Ott; if the latter, G. Sacco Albanese. See [http://www.kino.com/edison/d1.html Edison: The Invention of the Movies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514180127/http://www.kino.com/edison/d1.html |date=May 14, 2011 }} introduction to ''Monkeyshines, No. 1'' for the Kino Video DVD release.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts at synchronizing sound were soon left behind, while Dickson would also experiment with disc-based exhibition designs.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson (1907), part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:EdisonExpo.jpg|thumb|left|An acre in size, Edison's exhibit at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] included an entire electrical power station. (Smithsonian Institution/William J. Hammer Collection)]]
The project would soon head off in more productive directions, largely impelled by a trip of Edison's to Europe and the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris, for which he departed August 2 or 3, 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1997) gives August 2 (p. 27). Hendricks (1961) gives August 3 (p. 48).&lt;/ref&gt; During his two months abroad, Edison visited with scientist-photographer [[Étienne-Jules Marey]], who had devised a "[[chronophotography|chronophotographic gun]]"—the first portable motion picture [[camera]]—which used a strip of flexible film designed to capture sequential images at twelve frames per second.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin (2001), pp. 208–209. Baldwin describes the meeting as taking place in mid-September (p. 209); Burns (1998) says it was August (p. 73). See also Braun (1992), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to the United States, Edison filed another patent caveat, on November 2, which described a Kinetoscope based not just on a flexible filmstrip, but one in which the film was perforated to allow for its engagement by [[sprockets]], making its mechanical conveyance much more smooth and reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Musser (1994), p. 66; Spehr (2000), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The first motion picture system to employ a perforated image band was apparently the Théâtre Optique, patented by French inventor [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] in 1888. Reynaud's system did not use photographic film, but images painted on gelatine frames.&lt;ref&gt;Rossell (1998), p. 21; [http://www.victorian-cinema.net/reynaud.htm Charles-Émile Reynaud] biographical essay by Stephen Herbert, part of the ''Who's Who of Victorian Cinema'' website. Retrieved 10/23/06.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Exposition Universelle, Edison would have seen both the Théâtre Optique and the [[electrotachyscope|electrical tachyscope]] of German inventor Ottamar Anschütz.&lt;ref&gt;Braun (1992), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; This disc-based projection device is often referred to as an important conceptual source for the development of the Kinetoscope. Its crucial innovation was to take advantage of the [[persistence of vision]] theory by using an intermittent light source to momentarily "freeze" the projection of each image; the goal was to facilitate the viewer's retention of many minutely different stages of a photographed activity, thus producing a highly effective illusion of constant motion. By late 1890, intermittent visibility would be integral to the Kinetoscope's design.&lt;ref&gt;Burns (1998) claims that "in a patent dated 20 May 1889 Edison and Dickson used the same general arrangement [as Anschütz] of continuous movement and momentary light flashes in their viewing device, the kinetoscope" (p. 73). It is clear that Burns's dating is wildly incorrect and that he likely acquired the May 20 date from the first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope in 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of when the Edison lab began working on a filmstrip device is a matter of historical debate. According to Dickson, in the summer of 1889, he began cutting the stiff celluloid sheets supplied by Carbutt into strips for use in such a prototype machine; in August, by his description, he attended a demonstration of [[George Eastman]]'s new flexible film and was given a roll by an Eastman representative, which was immediately applied to experiments with the prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Spehr (2000), pp. 7, 23 n. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by historian Marta Braun, Eastman's product
&lt;blockquote&gt;
was sufficiently strong, thin, and pliable to permit the intermittent movement of the film strip behind [a camera] lens at considerable speed and under great tension without tearing&amp;nbsp;... stimulat[ing] the almost immediate solution of the essential problems of cinematic invention.&lt;ref&gt;Braun (1992), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:KinetographKayser2bis.jpg|thumb|right|Charles Kayser of the Edison lab seated behind the Kinetograph. Portability was not among the camera's virtues.]]
Some scholars—in particular, [[Gordon Hendricks]], in ''The Edison Motion Picture Myth'' (1961)—have argued that the lab began working on a filmstrip machine much later and that Dickson and Edison misrepresented the date to establish priority for reasons of both patent protection and intellectual status. In any event, though film historian David Robinson claims that "the cylinder experiments seem to have been carried on to the bitter end" (meaning the final months of 1890), as far back as September 1889—while Edison was still in Europe, but corresponding regularly with Dickson—the lab definitely placed its first order with the Eastman company for roll film. Three more orders for roll film were placed over the next five months.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1997), p. 29; Spehr (2000), pp. 7–8, 23 n. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only sporadic work was done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison's unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab's Kinetoscope account.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1997), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1891, however, Dickson, his new chief assistant, [[William Heise]], and another lab employee, Charles Kayser, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19&amp;nbsp;mm (3/4&amp;nbsp;inch) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered sprocket wheel, was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion and photographic evidence of single row of perforations: Robinson (1997), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; An electric lamp shone up from beneath the film, casting its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. As described by Robinson, a rapidly spinning shutter "permitted a flash of light so brief that [each] frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image."&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Robinson (1997), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The lab also developed a [[electric motor|motor]]-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an [[escapement]] disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of [[cinematography]].&lt;ref&gt;Gosser (1977), pp. 206–207; Dickson (1907), part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ButterflyDancebis.jpg|thumb|left|35 mm filmstrip of the Edison production ''Butterfly Dance'' (ca. 1894–95), featuring [[Annabelle Whitford Moore]], in the format that would become standard for both still and motion picture photography around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Note that some sources seem to refer to Annabelle Moore's metier interchangeably as the [[serpentine dance]] and the butterfly dance. In fact, an 1894 order from a London Kinetoscope parlor demonstrates that Moore had already performed at least three different dances for Edison; the order lists ''Anna Belle Sun Dance'', ''Anna Belle Serpentine Dance'', and ''Anna Belle Butterfly Dance''. Some authors apparently mistake the butterfly dance for the serpentine and vice versa; in addition, there may be multiple versions of one or more of the dance subjects, shot at different times. See Hendricks (1966), pp. 112, 135–136, illustrations 13, 15. The identification of the present image as from ''Butterfly Dance'' is based on its source, [http://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/pic/1999/99.nov.html The Henry Ford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310221409/http://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/pic/1999/99.nov.html |date=March 10, 2007 }}, which gives an ID number for the image. This source's dating of the image as 1895 is less certain; Moore did perform for Edison that year, but the original ''Butterfly Dance'' was produced in 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On May 20, 1891, the first public demonstration of a prototype Kinetoscope was given at the laboratory for approximately 150 members of the National Federation of Women's Clubs. The [[New York Sun (historical)|New York ''Sun'']] described what the club women saw in the "small pine box" they encountered:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the top of the box was a hole perhaps an inch in diameter. As they looked through the hole they saw the picture of a man. It was a most marvelous picture. It bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. Every motion was perfect....&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Robertson (2001), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The man was Dickson; the little movie, approximately three seconds long, is now referred to as ''[[Dickson Greeting]]''.

In the spring of the following year, steps began to make coin operation, via a nickel slot, part of the mechanics of the viewing system.&lt;ref&gt;Spehr (2000), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; By autumn 1892, the design of the Kinetoscope was essentially complete. The filmstrip, based on stock manufactured first by Eastman, and then, from April 1893 onward, by New York's Blair Camera Co., was [[35 mm film|35 mm]] (1 3/8&amp;nbsp;inches) wide; each vertically sequenced frame bore a rectangular image and four perforations on each side.&lt;ref&gt;Spehr (2000), pp. 11–14. The filmstock sent by the manufacturers was actually 1 9/16 inches wide; it was trimmed and perforated at the lab. Reports that either Eastman or Blair provided 70 mm stock that was cut in half and spliced at the lab are incorrect. One recent book that makes this mistaken claim (along with other poorly sourced descriptions of the Kinetoscope's development) is A. Michael Noll's ''Principles of Modern Communications Technology'' (Boston and London: Artech House, 2001; p. 88). Braun (1992) makes the same error (p. 190). See Spehr (2000), pp. 7–8, 12, for details on the width of the film supplied by Eastman to Edison.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years, this basic format would be adopted globally as the standard for motion picture film, which it remains to this day. The publication in the October 1892 ''Phonogram'' of [[cinematography|cinematographic]] sequences shot in the format demonstrates that the Kinetograph had already been reconfigured to produce movies with the new film.&lt;ref&gt;Musser (1994), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the Kinetoscope itself, there is a significant disagreement over the location of the shutter providing the crucial intermittent visibility effect. According to a report by inventor [[Herman Casler]] described as "authoritative" by Hendricks, who personally examined five of the six still-extant first-generation devices, "Just above the film,...a shutter wheel having five spokes and a very small rectangular opening in the rim [rotates] directly over the film. An incandescent lamp...is placed below the film...and the light passes up through the film, shutter opening, and magnifying lens...to the eye of the observer placed at the opening in the top of the case."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hendricks (1966), p. 14. See p. 11 for a description of Hendricks's direct examinations.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson, on the other hand, says the shutter—which he agrees has only a single slit—is positioned lower, "between the lamp and film".&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; The Casler–Hendricks description is supported by the diagrams of the Kinetoscope that accompany the 1891 patent application, in particular, diagram 2. A side view, it does not illustrate the shutter, but it shows the impossibility of it fitting between the lamp and the film without a major redesign and indicates a space that seems suitable for it between the film and the lens.&lt;ref&gt;Edison (1891b), diagrams 1, 2 [pp. 342, 343 in ''Light and Movement'']. Diagram 1, an overhead view of the apparatus looking down on the horizontally running filmstrip, also indicates that the shutter passes over the film—whether directly above it or over the lens as well is unclear. A fourth diagram [p. 345 in ''Light and Movement''] shows Edison's proposed stereoscopic film projection system: here the shutter is definitively placed between the projection lens and the screen; in an alternate configuration, depicted in an insert diagram, the shutter may run through "a slit in the body of the lens" itself (p. 2 [p. 340 in ''Light and Movement'']). A simplified version of Edison (1891b), diagram 1—lacking both diagram key numbers and patent application data—is available [http://www.victorian-cinema.net/kinetoscope1.jpg online] as part of the ''Who's Who in Victorian Cinema'' website. The large dotted circle represents the shutter.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's description, however, is supported by a photograph of a Kinetoscope interior that appears in Hendricks's own book.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks (1966), illustration 2. Patent historian Stephen van Dulken (2004) appears to err twice, describing a shutter with "slits" that is located between the lens and the peephole (p. 64).&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 1893, a patent was issued for the system that governed the intermittent movement of film in the Kinetograph. However, Robinson (1997) misleadingly stated that "patents for the Kinetograph camera and the Kinetoscope viewer were finally issued" in early 1893 (p.&amp;nbsp;38). As explained by Braun (1992), "except for the device used to stop and start the moving film, which was granted a patent in 1893, all the parts of the application describing the camera were ultimately disallowed because of previous inventors' claims" (p.&amp;nbsp;191). Also, Hendricks (1961) described the outcome of the camera patent similarly to Braun (pp.&amp;nbsp;136–137). The facts in sum are: (a) a patent solely for the intermittent movement apparatus was issued in February 1893; (b) all the other elements of the original Kinetograph patent applications were successfully challenged; and (c) a patent, number 589,168,&lt;ref name=pat589168&gt;[http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00589168&amp;SectionNum=1&amp;IDKey=1AB76A2F8CA6&amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/patimg.htm Letters Patent No. 589,168], issued August 31, 1897.

==Going public==
[[File:BlackMariabis.jpg|thumb|right|Construction of the imposing [[Edison's Black Maria|Black Maria]] began in December 1892. In order to take full advantage of sunlight, the tar paper–lined studio was equipped with a hinged, flip-up roof and the entire structure could rotate on a track. "It obeys no architectural rules," declared Dickson, who found it "productive of the happiest effects in the films."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Baldwin (2001), pp. 232, 233.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The premiere of the completed Kinetoscope was held not at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], as originally scheduled, but at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. The first film publicly shown on the system was ''[[Blacksmith Scene]]'' (aka ''Blacksmiths''); directed by Dickson and [[cinematography|shot]] by Heise, it was produced at the new Edison moviemaking studio, known as the [[Edison's Black Maria|Black Maria]].&lt;ref&gt;An enduring mystery concerns the length of the film. The [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000005/ entry in IMDb.com] clearly misstates it as 1 minute. Baldwin (2001) says "thirty seconds" (p. 238), the figure also reported by the ''[[Scientific American]]'' at the time (see Hendricks [1966], p. 38). Musser (2004) says "fifteen seconds" (p. 16). The [http://www.nps.gov/archive/edis/video.htm copy of the film] made available by the Edison National Historic Site \proximately 34 seconds, all shot from one camera position, without an apparent splice. As described later in the main text of the present article, at this point in the development of the Kinetograph and Kinetoscope, according to most accounts the maximum length of any film made with the system was 50 feet, meaning a maximum running time of about 50 seconds at the camera's slowest recorded speed, but only about 20 seconds at the camera's most common speed of 40 frames per second (see Hendricks [1966], pp. 6–8). As Hendricks reports, the filmstrip was probably not 50 feet, or 800 frames, long; Edison described it as containing "about 700" images (p. 36). Further complicating the matter, Braun (1992)—who evidently believes the faster speed was used—says that the early Kinetoscope movies could last 40 seconds rather than 20, because the film was configured as a loop (p. 191). The questions concerning the length of ''Blacksmith Scene'' have apparently never been directly addressed by any authorities in the field since Hendricks.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite extensive promotion, a major display of the Kinetoscope, involving as many as twenty-five machines, never took place at the Chicago exposition. Kinetoscope production had been delayed in part because of Dickson's absence of more than eleven weeks early in the year with a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks (1966), pp. 28–33. Given the dates of Dickson's departure and return that Hendricks provides, Dickson was gone for at least 80 days. Hendricks describes him as taking a "ten weeks' rest" (p. 28) or spending "about ten and a half weeks in the south" (p. 33), a plausible interpretation given travel time from New Jersey to Florida, where Dickson headed. There were also apparently problems—allegedly alcohol-fueled—with the lab employee, James Egan, who had been contracted to build the Kinetoscopes. See Hendricks (1966), pp. 34–35, 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson argues that "[s]peculation that a single Kinetoscope reached the Fair seems to be conclusively dismissed by an 1894 leaflet issued for the launching of the invention in London," which states, "the Kinetoscope was not perfected in time for the great Fair."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (p. 40).&lt;/ref&gt; Hendricks, in contrast, refers to accounts in the ''[[Scientific American]]'' of July 21 and October 21, 1893, that constitute evidence no less "conclusive" that one Kinetoscope did make it to the fair.&lt;ref name="Hendricks"&gt;Hendricks (1966), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of evidence supports Hendricks; as fair historian Stanley Appelbaum states, "Doubt has been cast on the reports of [the Kinetoscope's] actual presence at the fair, but these reports are numerous and circumstantial" (Appelbaum does err in claiming that the device was "first shown at the Exposition").&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum (1980), p. 47. See Hendricks (1966), pp. 40–45, for other reports.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hapci-fr.gif|thumb|left|The first U.S. copyright for an identifiable motion picture was given to Edison for ''[[Fred Ott's Sneeze]]''.]]
Work proceeded, though slowly, on the Kinetoscope project. On October 6, a U.S. [[copyright]] was issued for a "publication" received by the [[Library of Congress]] consisting of "Edison Kinetoscopic Records." It remains unclear what film was awarded this, the first motion picture copyright in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks (1966), pp. 47, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the year, the Kinetoscope project would be reenergized. During the first week of January 1894, a five-second film starring an Edison technician was shot at the Black Maria; ''[[Fred Ott's Sneeze]]'', as it is now widely known, was made expressly to produce a sequence of images for an article in ''[[Harper's]]'' magazine. Never intended for exhibition, it would become one of the most famous Edison films and the first identifiable motion picture to receive a U.S. copyright. Three months later, the Kinetoscope's epochal moment arrived.&lt;ref name=M21&gt;Musser (2002), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 1894, a public Kinetoscope parlor was opened by the Holland Bros. in New York City at 1155 Broadway, on the corner of 27th Street—the first commercial motion picture house. The venue had ten machines, set up in parallel rows of five, each showing a different movie. For 25 cents a viewer could see all the films in either row; half a dollar gave access to the entire bill.&lt;ref&gt;The machines were modified so that they did not operate by nickel slot. According to Hendricks (1966), in each row "attendants switched the instruments on and off for customers who had paid their twenty-five cents" (p. 13). For more on the Hollands, see Peter Morris, ''Embattled Shadows: A History of Canadian Cinema, 1895–1939'' (Montreal and Kingston, Canada; London; and Buffalo, New York: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1978), pp. 6–7. Morris states that Edison wholesaled the Kinetoscope at $200 per machine; in fact, as described below, $250 seems to have been the most common figure at first.&lt;/ref&gt; The machines were purchased from the new Kinetoscope Company, which had contracted with Edison for their production; the firm, headed by Norman C. Raff and Frank R. Gammon, included among its investors Andrew M. Holland, one of the entrepreneurial siblings, and Edison's former business chief, Alfred O. Tate. The ten films that comprise the first commercial movie program, all shot at the Black Maria, were descriptively titled: ''Barber Shop'', ''Bertoldi (mouth support)'' (Ena Bertoldi, a British vaudeville contortionist), ''Bertoldi (table contortion)'', ''Blacksmiths'', ''Roosters'' (some manner of cock fight), ''Highland Dance'', ''Horse Shoeing'', ''Sandow'' ([[Eugen Sandow]], a German strongman managed by [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]), ''Trapeze'', and ''Wrestling''.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks (1966), pp. 56, 60; Musser (1994), p. 81; [http://www.victorian-cinema.net/bertoldi.htm Ena Bertoldi (Beatrice Mary Claxton)] biographical essay by Barry Anthony/Luke McKernan, part of the ''Who's Who of Victorian Cinema'' website; [http://www.victorian-cinema.net/sandow.htm Eugen Sandow (Frederick Muller)] biographical essay by Richard Brown, part of the ''Who's Who of Victorian Cinema'' website.

Twenty-five cents for no more than a few minutes of entertainment was hardly cheap diversion. For the same amount, one could purchase a ticket to a major [[vaudeville]] theater; when America's first [[amusement park]] opened in [[Coney Island]] the following year, a 25-cent entrance fee covered admission to three rides, a performing sea lion show, and a dance hall.&lt;ref&gt;Grieveson and Krämer (2004), p. 34; Cross and Walton (2005), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinetoscope was an immediate success, however, and by June 1, the Hollands were also operating venues in Chicago and San Francisco. Entrepreneurs (including Raff and Gammon, with their own International Novelty Co.) were soon running Kinetoscope parlors and temporary exhibition venues around the United States. New firms joined the Kinetoscope Company in commissioning and marketing the machines. The Kinetoscope exhibition spaces were largely, though not uniformly, profitable. After fifty weeks in operation, the Hollands' New York parlor had generated approximately $1,400 in monthly receipts against an estimated $515 in monthly operating costs; receipts from the Chicago venue (located in a Masonic temple) were substantially lower, about $700 a month, though presumably operating costs were lower as well.&lt;ref&gt;Financial analysis based on Musser (1994), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; For each machine, Edison's business at first generally charged $250 to the Kinetoscope Company and other distributors, which would use them in their own exhibition parlors or resell them to independent exhibitors; individual films were initially priced by Edison at $10.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks (1966), pp. 13, 56, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Kinetoscope's first eleven months of commercialization, the sale of viewing machines, films, and auxiliary items generated a profit of more than $85,000 for Edison's company.&lt;ref&gt;For the profits from April 1, 1894, through February 28, 1895, see Musser (1994), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the new firms to enter the field was the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company; the firm's partners, brothers Otway and Grey Latham, Otway's friend [[Enoch Rector]], and their employer, Samuel J. Tilden Jr., sought to combine the popularity of the Kinetoscope with that of [[boxing|prizefighting]]. This led to a series of significant developments in the motion picture field: The Kinetograph was then capable of shooting only a 50-foot-long negative (evidence suggests {{convert|48|ft|m}} feet was the longest length actually used).&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks (1966), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; At 16 frames per foot, this meant a maximum running time of 20 seconds at 40 frames per second (fps), the speed most frequently employed with the camera. At the rate of 30 fps that had been used as far back as 1891, a film could run for almost 27 seconds. Hendricks identifies ''Sandow'' as having been shot at 16 fps, as does the Library of Congress in its online catalog, where its duration is listed as 40 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks (1966), pp. 6–8; Musser (1994), p. 78. Hendricks, who tested eighteen Kinetoscope films in his personal collection, demonstrated that "[i]n no case did the Maria camera operate as high as 46–48 frames per second," as some suggest (p. 6); he identifies the "average rate" ([[mode (statistics)|mode]], not [[mean]]) as "38–40 frames per second" (p. 7). Multiple sources incorrectly claiming 46 fps as the standard practical rate may be adduced; Burns (1998), for example, describes a "picture rate of 46 frames per second [that] restricted the viewing time to about 15 seconds" (p. 74). Dickson himself later gave varying accounts of the camera's rate—on one occasion he said it was "about 40 to the second"; on another, that it was between 25 and 46 fps. According to his 1907 account, the rate was 46 fps—though at one point matters are further confused by what appears to be an unintended suggestion of a functional rate of 42 fps (part 3). The Library of Congress/''Inventing Entertainment'' website makes accessible online video copies of many Kinetoscope films, including four shot with the 35 mm Kinetograph between January and March 1894. The library provides descriptions of the films, including running time and picture rate, again based on Musser's 1998 ''Edison Motion Pictures'' (all retrieved 10/29/06):

As noted, Hendricks (1966) gives the same speed for ''Sandow''. However, he lists both ''Fred Ott's Sneeze'' and ''Carmencita'' at 40 fps (he does not discuss "Athlete with wand") (p. 7). The Library of Congress catalog does support Hendricks's assertion that no Kinetoscope film was shot at 46 fps.&lt;/ref&gt; Even at the slowest of these rates, the running time would not have been enough to accommodate a satisfactory exchange of fisticuffs; 16 fps, as well, might have been thought to give too herky-jerky a visual effect for enjoyment of the sport. The Kinetograph and Kinetoscope were modified, possibly with Rector's assistance, so they could manage filmstrips three times longer than had previously been used.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsaye (1986) reports that Rector was central to the modification process (ch. 8), but no other source confirms this.

On June 14, a match with abbreviated rounds was staged between boxers Michael Leonard and Jack Cushing at the Black Maria. Seven-hundred-and-fifty feet worth of images or even more were shot at the rate of 30 fps—easily the longest motion picture to date.&lt;ref&gt;Camera speed per Hendricks (1966), p. 7; Musser (1994), p. 82; [http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/papr:@filreq(@field(NUMBER+@band(edmp+4026))+@field(COLLID+edison)) Leonard-Cushing fight] part of the Library of Congress/''Inventing Entertainment'' website. Retrieved 12/14/06. Hendricks quotes two contemporary newspaper reports describing a rate of 46 fps (pp. 92, 95); this seems clearly incorrect, based on the camera's mechanical potential rather than its practical application. Confusingly, Hendricks himself refers in his description of the film to "frames flying by the camera gate at a rate of 40 per second" (p. 96). The newspaper accounts both state that 150 feet of film were shot of each round, a total of 900 feet. Hendricks makes a detailed case that, rather than 150 feet, each round was likely recorded on 126 feet worth of exposed film (p. 96). The Edison film catalog, however, does claim 150 feet for each round. See [http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/papr:@filreq(@field(NUMBER+@band(edmp+4026))+@field(COLLID+edison)) Leonard–Cushing fight] part of the Library of Congress/''Inventing Entertainment'' educational website.

A half-dozen expanded Kinetoscope machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning sixty cents to see the complete bout.&lt;ref&gt;There is a major disagreement about the success of the film. In Ramsaye's (1986) account, "Throngs packed the [Latham kinetoscope parlor], and by the second day long lines of waiting patrons trailed back into the street. The police came to keep order" (ch. 8). According to Hendricks (1966), the Latham parlor "apparently never flourished. Rector's squadron of police 'to keep order' was either Rector or Ramsaye hyperbole.... There is little question...that the comparative obscurity of the fighters...contributed to the lack of success" (pp. 98–99). Neither author references a contemporary source in support of his version.&lt;/ref&gt; For a planned series of follow-up fights (of which the outcome of at least the first was fixed), the Lathams signed famous heavyweight [[James J. Corbett]], stipulating that his image could not be recorded by any other Kinetoscope company—the first movie star contract.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsaye (1986), ch. 8–9; Musser (1994), pp. 82–84; [http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/papr:@filreq(@field(NUMBER+@band(edmp+4026))+@field(COLLID+edison)) Leonard–Cushing fight].

Just three months after the commercial debut of the motion picture came the first recorded instance of motion picture [[censorship]]. The film in question showed a performance by the Spanish dancer [[Carmencita]], a New York music hall star since the beginning of the decade. According to one description of her live act, she "communicated an intense sexuality across the footlights that led male reporters to write long, exuberant columns about her performance"—articles that would later be reproduced in the Edison film catalog.&lt;ref&gt;Musser (2004), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinetoscope movie of her dance, shot at the Black Maria in mid-March 1894, was playing in the New Jersey resort town [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]] by summer. The town's founder, James A. Bradley, a real estate developer and leading member of the [[Methodism|Methodist]] community, had recently been elected a state senator:&lt;ref&gt;Karcher (1998), pp. 39, 82, 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; "The ''Newark Evening News'' of 17 July 1894 reported that [Senator] Bradley...was so shocked by the glimpse of Carmencita's ankles and lace that he complained to Mayor Ten Broeck. The showman was thereupon ordered to withdraw the offending film, which he replaced with ''Boxing Cats''."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1996), p. 349. For an extended excerpt from the article, see Hendricks (1966), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, a San Francisco exhibitor was arrested for a Kinetoscope operation "alleged to be indecent."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hendricks (1966), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The group whose disgruntlement occasioned the arrest was the Pacific Society for the Suppression of Vice, whose targets included "illicit literature, obscene pictures and books, the sale of morphine, cocaine, opium, tobacco and liquors to minors, lottery tickets, etc.," and which proudly took credit for having "caused 70 arrests and obtained 48 convictions" in a recent two-month span.&lt;ref&gt;Musser (1994), p. 78; Jenness (1894), p. 47. Hendricks (1966) states that the secretary of the organization himself made the arrest (p. 78).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:KinetoscopeLondonbis.jpg|thumb|right|Advertisement announcing the initial Kinetoscope exhibition in London, held on October 17, 1894.]]
The Kinetoscope was also gaining notice on the other side of the Atlantic. In the summer of 1894, it was demonstrated at 20, boulevard Poissonnière in Paris; this was one of the primary inspirations to the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière]] brothers, who would go on to develop the first commercially successful movie projection system.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (1999), p. 183. Burns (1998) says the exhibition took place in August (p. 73); Grieveson and Krämer (2004) say it was September (p. 12).&lt;/ref&gt; On October 17, 1894, the first Kinetoscope parlor outside the United States opened in London.&lt;ref&gt;Musser (1994), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Dissemination of the system proceeded rapidly in Europe, as Edison had left his patents unprotected overseas. The most likely reason was the technology's reliance on a variety of foreign innovations and a consequent belief that patent applications would have little chance of success. An alternative view, however, used to be popular: The 1971 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', for instance, claims that Edison "apparently thought so little of his invention that he failed to pay the $150 that would have granted him an international copyright {{sic}}."&lt;ref&gt;Griffith and Reed (1971), p. 900.&lt;/ref&gt; As recently as 2004, Andrew Rausch stated that Edison "balked at a $150 fee for overseas patents" and "saw little commercial value in the Kinetoscope."&lt;ref&gt;Rausch (2004), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Edison, as much a businessman as an inventor, spent approximately $24,000 on the system's development and went so far as to build a facility expressly for moviemaking before his U.S. patent was awarded, Rausch's interpretation is not widely shared by present-day scholars.&lt;ref&gt;For the cost of the Kinetoscope's development: Millard (1990), p. 148; Spehr (2000), p. 7. For discussion of Edison's decision not to pursue European patents, see, e.g., Braun (1992), pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the cause, two Greek entrepreneurs, George Georgiades and George Tragides, took advantage of the opening. Already successfully operating a pair of London movie parlors with Edison Kinetoscopes, they commissioned English inventor and manufacturer [[Robert W. Paul]] to make copies of them. After fulfilling the Georgiades–Tragides contract, Paul decided to go into the movie business himself, proceeding to make dozens of additional Kinetoscope reproductions. Paul's work would result in a series of important innovations in both camera and exhibition technology.&lt;ref&gt;Rossell (1998), pp. 91–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, plans were advancing at the Black Maria to realize Edison's goal of a motion picture system uniting image with sound.

==Kinetophone==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[35 mm film]] --&gt;
[[File:Kinetophonebis1.jpg|thumb|right|The 1895 version of the Kinetophone in use, showing the earphones that lead to the cylinder phonograph within the cabinet]]
[[File:DicksonFilm High.ogv|left|thumb|Test film made for the Kinetephone system in 1894/5, to test synchronization of film and sound. Film was preserved at the Library of Congress with no sound; wax cylinder recording later found at the Edison National Historic Site, and both were combined using digital methods to recreate the original film.&lt;ref&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DicksonFilm_High.ogv&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Kinetophone (aka Phonokinetoscope) was an early attempt by Edison and Dickson to create a [[sound film|sound-film]] system. Reports suggest that in July 1893, a Kinetoscope accompanied by a cylinder phonograph had been presented at the Chicago World's Fair.&lt;ref name="Hendricks"/&gt; The first known movie made as a test of the Kinetophone was shot at Edison's New Jersey studio in late 1894 or early 1895, which is now referred to as [[The Dickson Experimental Sound Film]]; this film, along with a short film from 1913 called Nursery Favorites and a 1912 demonstration film, are the only surviving movies with live-recorded sound made for the Kinetophone. In March 1895, Edison offered the device for sale; involving no technological innovations, it was a Kinetoscope whose modified cabinet included an accompanying cylinder phonograph. Kinetoscope owners were also offered kits with which to retrofit their equipment. The first Kinetophone exhibitions appear to have taken place in April.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1997), p. 51; Musser (1994), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Though a Library of Congress educational website states, "The picture and sound were made somewhat synchronous by connecting the two with a belt,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmrrg.html Edison: The Marriage of Sight and Sound] part of the Library of Congress/''Inventing Entertainment'' educational website. Retrieved 10/22/06.&lt;/ref&gt; this is incorrect. As historian David Robinson describes, "The Kinetophone...made no attempt at synchronization. The viewer listened through tubes to a phonograph concealed in the cabinet and performing approximately appropriate music or other sound." Historian [[Douglas Gomery]] concurs, "[Edison] did not try to synchronize sound and image." Leading production sound mixer Mark Ulano writes, "[O]nly 45 Kinetophones were made. They did NOT play synchronously other than the phonograph turned on when viewing and off when stopped."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1997), p. 51; Gomery (1985), p. 54; [http://www.filmsound.org/ulano/talkies2.htm "The Movies Are Born a Child of the Phonograph"] by Mark Ulano, C.A.S., part of the ''FilmSound.org'' website. Retrieved 10/22/06. See also Hendricks (1966), pp. 48–50, 118–125; Millard (1990), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the surviving Dickson test involves live-recorded sound, certainly most, and probably all, of the films marketed for the Kinetophone were shot as silents, predominantly march or dance subjects; exhibitors could then choose from a variety of musical cylinders offering a rhythmic match.&lt;ref&gt;Altman (2004), pp. 81–83; Hendricks (1966), pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, three different cylinders with orchestral performances were proposed as accompaniments for ''Carmencita'': "Valse Santiago", "La Paloma", and "Alma-Danza Spagnola".&lt;ref&gt;''Guida practica'' (1895–96), p. 126 [p. 348 in ''Light and Movement''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as Edison followed his dream of securing the Kinetoscope's popularity by adding sound to its allure, many in the field were beginning to suspect that film projection was the next step that should be pursued. When Norman Raff communicated his customers' interest in such a system to Edison, the great inventor summarily rejected the notion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
No, if we make this screen machine that you are asking for, it will spoil everything. We are making these peep show machines and selling a lot of them at a good profit. If we put out a screen machine there will be a use for maybe about ten of them in the whole United States. With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ramsaye (1986), ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Under continuing pressure from Raff, Edison eventually conceded to investigate the possibility of developing a projection system. He seconded one of his lab's technicians to the Kinetoscope Company to initiate the work, without informing Dickson. Dickson's ultimate discovery of this move appears to have been one of the central factors leading to his break with Edison that occurred in spring 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsaye (1986), ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projecting Kinetoscopes==
[[File:EdisonAdCa1900bis.jpg|thumb|left|In the first decade of the 1900s, years before developing the compact Home Projecting Kinetoscope, Edison marketed an essentially theatrical 35 mm Projecting Kinetoscope for domestic use.]]
Over the course of 1895, it became clear that the Kinetoscope was going to lose out on one end to projected motion pictures and, on the other, to a new "peep show" device, the cheap, [[flip book|flip-book]]-based [[Mutoscope]]. In its second year of commercialization, the Kinetoscope operation's profits plummeted by more than 95 percent, to just over $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;Musser (1994), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latham brothers and their father, [[Woodville Latham|Woodville]], had retained the services of former Edison employee [[Eugene Lauste]] and then, in April 1895, Dickson himself to develop a film projection system. On May 20, in New York City, the new [[Eidoloscope]] was used for the first commercial screening of a motion picture: a boxing match between [[Young Griffo]] and Charles Barnett, four or eight minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsaye (1986), ch. 9–10: four minutes; Musser (1994), pp. 92–93: eight minutes.  There are old claims that one Jean Acmé LeRoy projected films in New York to an invited audience in February 1894 and to paying customers in New Jersey in February 1895. See Gosser (1977) for a discussion of the dubious nature of these claims (pp. 228–229).&lt;/ref&gt; European inventors, most prominently the Lumières and Germany's [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky]] brothers, were moving forward with similar systems.

By the beginning of 1896, Edison had turned his attention to promoting a projector technology, the Photoscope, developed by young inventors [[Charles Francis Jenkins|Charles Jenkins]] . The rights to the system had been acquired by Charles and Gammon, who redubbed it the [[Vitascope]] and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator.&lt;ref&gt;Musser (2002), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year, Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope. In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure.&lt;ref&gt;Stross (2007), pp. 228–229; Zielinski (1999), p. 190; Musser (1991), pp. 473–474; [http://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/pic/1999/99.nov.html The Henry Ford: Pic of the Month—November 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310221409/http://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/pic/1999/99.nov.html |date=March 10, 2007 }}. In Musser's description, the "21mm strip contained three 5.7mm images across its width." The Henry Ford describes the strip as "22-mm in width."&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Much of the Edison company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Gunning (1994), pp. 61–65, 143–144; Musser (1994), pp. 239, 240, 254, 272, 290, 292, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Optic Projection fig 221.jpg|thumb|right|Image of a Projecting Kinetoscope published in 1914]]
As far back as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had screened films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; in the style of the Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Musser (1994), p. 178; Altman (2004), pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks (1966), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design.&lt;ref&gt;Millard (1990), p. 226. Rausch (2004) claims a specific invention was vital in this process: "In 1908, Edison returned with a device known as the Cinemaphone. This device adjusted the speed of a motion picture to match that of a Phonograph. This led to the Kinetophone...." (p. 78). Neither any of the standard biographies of Edison nor any of the leading histories of early sound film mention this "Cinemaphone." Gomery (2005) does state, "To correct synchronization malfunctions Edison inserted an adjustment dial" into the 1913 version of the Kinetophone (p. 28). Gomery does not name this device and in no way suggests that it was created in 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys.&lt;ref&gt;Gomery (2005), pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Altman (2004), pp. 175–178; Gomery (1985), pp. 54–55; Gomery (2005), pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More citations needed|date=October 2013}}
The '''letter of introduction''', along with the [[visiting card]], was an important part of polite social interaction in the 18th and 19th centuries.  It remains important in formal situations, such as an [[ambassador]] presenting his or her [[credential]]s (a [[letter of credence]]), and in certain business circles.

In general, a person would not interact socially with others unless they had been properly introduced, whether in person or by letter.  A person of lower social status would request a patron of higher social status to write a letter of introduction to a third party, also of higher social status than the first person, but lower than the second person.  It was important to observe the niceties of [[etiquette]] in requesting, writing and presenting such letters, in such matters as the quality of the paper used, and whether it would be delivered unsealed to allow the requesting party to read it.  For example, it was best practice to deliver a letter of introduction to the intended recipient with a [[visiting card]], to allow the recipient to reciprocate by calling upon the sender the next day.

When [[Benjamin Franklin]] served as Ambassador to France (1776–1785) he was besieged by those traveling to America who desired letters of introduction. With his inimitable sense of style and humor, Ambassador Franklin drafted the following letter: 
{{quote|The bearer of this, who is going to America, presses me to give him a letter of recommendation, though I know nothing of him, not even his name. This may seem extraordinary, but I assure you that it is not uncommon here. Sometimes, indeed, one unknown person brings another, equally unknown, to recommend him; and sometimes they recommend one another. As to this gentleman, I must refer you to himself for his character and merits, with which he is certainly better acquainted than I can possibly be. I recommend him, however, to those civilities which every stranger of whom one knows no harm has a right to; and I request you will do him all good offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schoenbrun |first=David  |title=Triumph in Paris: The Exploits of Benjamin Franklin |url= |accessdate= |year=1976 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=0-06-013854-8 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{details|topic=Roman families|Gens}}
The '''gens''' (plural '''gentes''') was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]], or [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] family, consisting of all those individuals who shared the same ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'' and claimed descent from a common ancestor.  It was an important social and legal structure in early Roman history.&lt;ref name=hdca&gt;''[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities]]'', Second Edition, [[Harry Thurston Peck]], Editor (1897)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 2nd Ed. (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinguishing characteristic of a gens was the ''nomen gentilicium'', or ''gentile name''.  Every member of a gens, whether by birth or [[Roman adoption|adoption]], bore this name.  All nomina were based on other nouns, such as [[given name|personal names]], occupations, physical characteristics or behaviors, or locations.  Consequently, most of them ended with the adjectival termination ''-ius'' (''-ia'' in the feminine form).&lt;ref name=hdca /&gt;

Nomina ending in ''-aius'', ''-eius'', ''-eus'', and ''-aeus'' are typical of [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] families.  [[Falisci|Faliscan]] gentes frequently had nomina ending in ''-ios'', while [[Samnium|Samnite]] and other [[Oscan language|Oscan]]-speaking peoples of southern Italy had nomina ending in ''-iis''.  [[Umbri]]an nomina typically end in ''-as'', ''-anas'', ''-enas'', or ''-inas'', while nomina ending in ''-arna'', ''-erna'', ''-ena'', ''-enna'', ''-ina'', or ''-inna'' are characteristic of Etruscan families.&lt;ref name=hdca /&gt;

The word ''gens'' is feminine, and the name of a gens was also feminine.  [[Marcus Valerius Corvus]] was a member of ''gens Valeria''.  ''Valerius'' was his nomen.  His son's nomen would have been ''Valerius'', and his daughter's ''Valeria''.  Male members of his gens were collectively called ''Valerii'', and female members ''Valeriae''.  If a member of the gens were adopted into another family, he would assume the nomen of that gens, followed by the ''[[cognomen]]'' ''Valerianus''.&lt;ref name=oxford /&gt;

In the following list, "I" and "J" are treated as separate letters, as are "U" and "V".  The letter "K" was rare in Latin, and the few nomina occasionally spelled with this letter were usually spelled with "C".  No Roman gentes began with "X", and the letters "Y" and "Z" occurred only in names borrowed from Greek.  The letter "W" did not exist in Classical Latin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">A '''literate environment''' may include written materials ([[newspapers]], [[books]] and [[posters]]), electronic and broadcast [[Mass media|media]] (radios and TVs) and information and communications technology ([[phones]], [[computers]] and [[Internet]] access), which encourage literacy acquisition, a reading culture, improved literacy retention and access to information.

Literate environments can be found in both public and private spheres, including home, school, workplace, local community and the nation as a whole. Developing rich literate environments therefore includes [[Language policy|language policies]], book publishing, media, and access to information and reading materials.

A rich literate environment is essential for encouraging individuals to become literate and sustain and integrate their newly acquired skills in their everyday lives. The social and cultural environments in which people live and work can be characterized as being either more or less supportive of the acquisition and practice of literacy. In certain developing country contexts, the lack of written material in whatever form is a serious constraint on the practice of literacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/education/GMR2006/full/chapt10_eng.pdf The EFA Global Monitoring Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-directed learning==

===Sudbury schools===

Sudbury Valley School claims that in their school there are plentiful ways to learn to read, and that students rarely ask staff for help.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987) Free at Last, The Sudbury Valley School, [https://books.google.com/books?id=es2nOuZE0rAC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Free+at+Last&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=8#v=onepage&amp;q=Chapter%205%2C%20The%20Other%20%27R%27s&amp;f=false Chapter 5, ''The Other 'R's''].

Retrieved, December 27 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unschooling===

Carlo Ricci, Professor of Education and editor of the ''Journal of Unschooling and Alternative Learning'', asserts that kids will become motivated to read because they live in a literate environment.&lt;ref&gt;He describes how his daughter learned to read in the video clip Learning to Read, linked from his [http://faculty.nipissingu.ca/carlor/ web site].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MEETin.org''', or the MEETin group, is a web-based social community dedicated to providing a casual social environment for people without charging membership fees, or otherwise profiting from events. Founded in [[Washington, DC]] in 2003, the MEETin group now spans around 90 cities worldwide and has over 90,000 members.&lt;ref name=MeetAbout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meetin.org/about.cfm |title=How Did MEETin Start |accessdate=2007-03-13 |work=About Us |publisher=Meetin.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The MEETin group was established by Mikey Heard on 14 March 2003, in Washington, DC, to connect people socially in the city.&lt;ref name=ontap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontaponline.com/view_article.php?article_id=10453 |title=Group of the Month: MEETinDC |accessdate=2007-03-13 |last=Hopkins |first=Joy |date=December 2006 |work=On Tap Magazine |publisher=Five O'Clock Publishing, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the DC chapter became increasingly active, another 16 chapters were founded in other US cities, which included many of the largest MEETin chapters to this day.  Although MEETin began as a [[Yahoo Group]], Heard soon constructed a new web site to deal with the expansion in membership and locations. This web site now defines the identity of the MEETin group and the infrastructure is still very much in use today.

==The MEETin Vibe==
The MEETin "Vibe" represents the general culture and attitude of the MEETin group. Each chapter is run by local volunteers with the main purpose of bringing people together to find new friends in their city. The MEETin group also help connect cities around the globe, and allows members to quickly re-establish their social network across various MEETin cities. As an integral part of the MEETin Vibe, members are encouraged to organize and participate in social events in any given MEETin city, without the pressures of business networking or "pick-up" scenes. Further, members are also forbidden to organize events from which they can profit, either financially or by gain of goods or services.

MEETin has been recognized in both the ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;ref name=washpost&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Washington Post |first=Ellen |last=McCarthy| title=Come Together |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/14/AR2007061400319.html?hpid=artslot |work=Washington Post |pages=WE25 |date=June 15, 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''[[Business Week]]''.&lt;ref name=busweek&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Business Week |first=Olga |last=Kharif| title=Social Networking Goes Offline |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2007/tc20070615_126704.htm  |work=Business Week |pages=Special Report |date=June 18, 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event planning and participation==
Events can be organized by any MEETin member, or co-hosted by two members. Leaders will assist in hosting of events as necessary. Interest groups can also be established on each local MEETin chapter to facilitate specially-catered events, such as film viewing, dinner nights, and book clubs. It was specifically designed to not be a dating service. Events are created by any member by posting it on the local group's web site, and events have no fees or dues.&lt;ref name=oregonian&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Allman |title='MiPL' up some new acquaintances |url=http://www.meetin.org/pdfs/MIPLOR_1.PDF |format=PDF |work=The Oregonian |pages=E1, E2 |date=August 11, 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094357/http://www.meetin.org/pdfs/MIPLOR_1.PDF |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magnanimity''' (from Latin ''[[wikt: magnanimitas|magnanimitās]]'', from ''[[wikt: magna|magna]]'' "big" + ''[[wikt:animus|animus]]'' "soul, spirit") is the virtue of being great of mind and heart.  It encompasses, usually, a refusal to be petty, a willingness to face danger, and actions for noble purposes. Its [[antithesis]] is pusillanimity (Latin: ''[[wikt:pusillanimitas|pusillanimitās]]''). Although the word magnanimity has a traditional connection to Aristotelian philosophy, it also has its own tradition in English which now causes some confusion.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker+page%3D1123a#note2 footnote] in the Rackham edition. In the Sachs translation it is remarked that two possible translations "pride" and "high mindedness" both only get half of the meaning, while magnanimity only "shifts the problem into Latin".&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Aristotle==
The Latin word ''magnanimitās'' comes from the Greek word μεγαλοψυχία (''megalopsychia'') which means "greatness of soul." In the context of ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' IV.3, [[Aristotle]] associates ''megalopsychia'' more with a sense of pride and self-worth rather than the modern sense of magnanimity. Aristotle writes (1123b1-2), "Now a person is thought to be great-souled if he claims much and deserves much" (δοκεῖ δὴ μεγαλόψυχος εἶναι ὁ μεγάλων αὑτὸν ἀξιῶν ἄξιος ὤν). W.D. Ross translates Aristotle's statement ἔοικε μὲν οὖν ἡ μεγαλοψυχία οἷον κόσμος τις εἶναι τῶν ἀρετῶν· μείζους γὰρ αὐτὰς ποιεῖ, καὶ οὐ γίνεται ἄνευ ἐκείνων (1124a1-2) as the following: "Pride [''megalopsychia''], then, seems to be a sort of crown of the virtues; for it makes them greater, and it is not found without them." The great-souled, Aristotle adds, are "thought to have a good memory for any benefit they have conferred, but a bad memory for those which they have received [...] It is also characteristic of the great-souled man never to ask help from others, or only with reluctance, but to render aid willingly; and to be dignified towards men of position and fortune, unassuming towards those of moderate station..." (1124b25-26, H. Rackham's translation for [[Loeb Classical Library]]).

==Other uses==
[[Noah Webster]] of the American Language defines ''Magnanimity'' as such:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
MAGNANIMITY, n. [L. magnanimitas; magnus, great, and animus, mind.] Greatness of mind; that elevation or dignity of soul, which encounters danger and trouble with tranquility and firmness, which raises the possessor above revenge, and makes him delight in acts of benevolence, which makes him disdain injustice and meanness, and prompts him to sacrifice personal ease, interest and safety for the accomplishment of useful and noble objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noah Webster|Webster, N.]], ''Dictionary of the American Language'', 1828.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Edmund Spenser]], in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', had each knight [[allegorical]]ly represent a virtue; Prince Arthur represented "magnificence", which is generally taken to mean Aristotelian magnificence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.4.iv.html#185 ''Nichomachaen Ethics'' IV 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Spenser|Spenser, E.]], ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The uncompleted work does not include Prince Arthur's book, and the significance is not clear.

[[Democritus]] states that "magnanimity consists in enduring tactlessness with mildness".

As an adjective, the concept is expressed as "magnanimous", e.g. "He is a magnanimous man."  An example of referring to one as magnanimous can be seen in [[Hrólfs saga kraka]] where King [[Hrólfr Kraki]] changes the name of a court servant from Hott to Hjalti for his new-found strength and courage, after which Hjalti refuses to taunt or kill those who previously mocked him.  Because of his noble actions, the king then bestows the title Magnanimous upon Hjalti.

One form of magnanimity is the generosity of the victor to the defeated. For example, magnanimity has been codified between societies by the [[Geneva Conventions]].

Magnanimous relief efforts can serve to offset the collateral damage of war.

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', refers to the chest of man as the seat of magnanimity, or sentiment, with this magnanimity working as the liaison between visceral and cerebral man.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis|Lewis, C. S.]], ''[[The Abolition of Man]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis asserts that, in his time, the denial of the emotions that are found in the eternal and sublime -- that which is humbling as an objective reality -- had led to "men without chests".

'''''McCollum v. Board of Education''''', 333 U.S. 203 (1948),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=McCollum v. Board of Education|333|203|1948}}. {{Include-FedCourts}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case related to the power of a state to use its tax-supported [[public education#United States public schools|public school system]] to aid religious instruction. The case was a test of the [[separation of church and state]] with respect to education.

The case tested the principle of "[[released time]]", where public schools set aside class time for religious instruction. The Court struck down a  [[Champaign, Illinois]] program as unconstitutional because of the public school system's involvement in the administration, organization and support of religious instruction classes. The Court noted that some 2,000 communities nationwide offered similar released time programs affecting 1.5 million students.

==Background==
The case was brought by [[Vashti McCollum]], the mother of a student enrolled in the Champaign public school district.

In 1940,  interested members of various [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], and [[Judaism|Jewish]] faiths formed an association named the Champaign Council on Religious Education. This association obtained permission from the Champaign Board of Education to offer voluntary religious education classes for public school students from grades four to nine. These weekly 30- and 45-minute classes were led by clergy and lay members of the association in public school classrooms during school hours.

McCollum, an [[atheist]], objected to the religious classes, stating that her son James was ostracized for not attending them. After complaints to school officials to stop offering these classes went unheeded, McCollum sued the school board in July 1945, stating that the religious instruction in the public schools violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]]—the principle of [[separation of church and state in the United States]]. McCollum also complained that the school district's religious education classes violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The principal elements of the McCollum complaint were that:

* In actual practice certain Protestant groups exercised an advantage over other Protestant denominations.
* The school district's calling the classes "voluntary" was in name only because school officials coerced or forced students' participation.
* The power exercised by the Champaign Council on Religious Education in its selection of instructors, and the school superintendent's oversight of these instructors served to determine which religious faiths participated in the instructional program, and constituted a prior censorship of religion.

In her suit, McCollum asked that the Board of Education be ordered to "adopt and enforce rules and regulations prohibiting all instruction in and teaching of all religious education in all public schools in Champaign District Number 71, and in all public school houses and buildings in said district when occupied by public schools".

The Circuit Court of [[Champaign County, Illinois|Champaign County]] ruled in favor of the school district in January 1946, and upon appeal the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] affirmed the lower court's ruling.

==Decision of the Court==
McCollum appealed the case to the U. S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case, taking oral arguments in December 1947. A number of religious groups including the [[American Unitarian Association]], the [[Synagogue Council of America]], the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]] and the [[Baptist Joint Committee|Baptist Joint Committee of Religious Liberty]] filed briefs in support of McCollum’s position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last1 = Lieblich | first1 = Julia
  | title = Back to the Future?  | newspaper = Christianity Today.  | date = 18 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last1 = Dart | first1 = John
  | title = A pioneer figure in church-state rulings  | newspaper = Christian Century.  | date = 19 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 1948, the Court ruled 8-1 in favor of McCollum, ruling that the classes were unconstitutional.

In the majority opinion, written by Justice [[Hugo Black]], the Court held that

{{Quote|[The facts] show the use of tax-supported property for religious instruction and the close cooperation between the school authorities and the religious council in promoting religious education. The operation of the state's compulsory education system thus assists and is integrated with the program of religious instruction carried on by separate religious sects. Pupils compelled by law to go to school for secular education are released … in part from their legal duty upon the condition that they attend the religious classes.

To hold that a state cannot, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, utilize its public school system to aid any or all religious faiths or sects in the dissemination of their doctrines and ideals does not … manifest a governmental hostility to religion or religious teachings. … For the First Amendment rests upon the premise that both religion and government can best work to achieve their lofty aims if each is left free from the other within its respective sphere.}}

===Dissent===
The lone dissenting justice, [[Stanley Forman Reed]], objected to the breadth of the majority's interpretation of the Establishment Clause and stated that an incidental support of religion should have been permissible with a more narrow reading of the First Amendment.

==Subsequent developments==
The Supreme Court's ruling remanded the case to the Illinois high court for relief consistent with the federal ruling.

The high court revisited the issue of religious instruction in ''[[Zorach v. Clauson]]'' in 1952. The 6 to 3 ruling in the later case held that a [[New York (state)|New York]] program allowing religious education during the school day was permissible, because it did not use public school facilities or public funds.

The '''National Immigration Agency of the Ministry of the Interior''' ('''NIA'''; {{zh|c=內政部移民署|p=Nèizhèngbù Yímínshǔ|poj=Luē-chèng-pō͘ Î-bîn-sú}}) is the statutory agency under the [[Ministry of the Interior (Taiwan)|Ministry of Interior]] of the Republic of China ([[Taiwan]]) which is responsible for immigration, entry and exit security, [[Border control|border services]] and registration of foreigners. The agency is headed by the [[Director General]]. The current Director-General is Jeff Jia-Jun Yang.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.immigration.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1349509&amp;ctNode=32813&amp;mp=2&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency does not manage [[customs]] which is managed by the [[Ministry of Finance (Taiwan)|Ministry of Finance]].

==History==
[[File:ROC-MOI National Immigration Agency entry 20170107.jpg|thumb|National Immigration Agency entry.]]
The agency was established in early 2007 to deal with [[immigration]] and [[border control]]. This include the care and guidance of new immigrants, exit and entry control, the inspection on [[illegal immigrant]]s, the forcible [[deportation]], and the prevention of [[human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immigration.gov.tw/immig_eng/aspcode/main10.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The agency also deals with documents of foreigners and nationals of the People's Republic of [[China]] (including [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]).

Prior to that it was known as the [[Taiwan Garrison Command]] and Taiwan Province Police Department. It was initially in charge of Taiwan’s border control for both military personnel and civilians respectively. In 1952, Military Personnel and Civilians Exit and Entry United Scrutiny Department was established and became the authority for border control.

In March 1957, the department’s name was changed to Entry and Exit Control Department, subordinated to Taiwan Vigilance Headquarters and then to Taiwan Garrison Headquarters created in July 1958. In 1972, the government delegated border control, originally under the defense establishment, to a common administrative agency in response to the needs for social development and consequently the Immigration Bureau under the National Police Agency was established.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immigration.gov.tw//immig_eng/aspcode/mainc.asp#&lt;/ref&gt;

For years, Taiwan’s border control and immigration had been separately administered by various agencies, resulting in the administrative inefficiency. The Immigration Act was promulgated on 21 May 1999, which proposed the National Immigration Agency or NIA, shall be established under the [[Ministry of the Interior (Taiwan)]] to be responsible of border control and immigration. Subsequently, other statutes related to the NIA were also drafted and then passed by the [[Legislative Yuan]] on 8 November 2005 and promulgated by the President on 11 November 2005. Therefore, the NIA has been officially established since 2 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immigration.gov.tw//immig_eng/aspcode/mainc.asp#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Department Structure==
[[File:ROC-MOI National Immigration Agency in Guang-ping Building 20170107.jpg|thumb|National Immigration Agency building.]]

The National Immigration Agency is organised in the following structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immigration.gov.tw/immig_eng/aspcode/Organization.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
*Entry and Exit Affairs Division
*Immigration Affairs Division

'''Noite''' (''Night'') is a novel, written by the famed Brazilian writer [[Érico Veríssimo]] in 1954.

==Plot summary==
In the 1950s, a man finds himself in the middle of the streets of [[Porto Alegre]] with a wallet full of money... and no memory of any past events.

He finds two "vultures of the night", enigmatic noctivague figures with a high penchant for [[bohemian]] lifestyles. The "vultures" (called The Master and The Hunchback) take the man on a surrealistic journey through the darkest places of the city, to "enjoy the night": a funeral parlor, the emergency service of a hospital, a deluxe [[whorehouse]] and a low-level working class [[cabaret]].

At the same time, the two enigmatic figures surreptitiously try to make the man-with-no-memory
assume that he committed a horrendous crime early that night, in which a woman was the subject of a brutal passion-related crime and no [[perpetrator]] was yet arrested by the [[police]].

The book has a unique atmosphere in depicting the low-level [[bohemy]] that crowded some places in the Brazilian urban legends.

In the 1980s, Brazilian film director [[José Louzeiro]] conducted a movie loosely based on the book.

The '''North Baffin dialect''' (''Qikiqtaaluk uannangani'' or ''Iglulingmiut'') of Inuktitut is spoken on the northern part of [[Baffin Island]], at [[Igloolik]] and the adjacent part of the [[Melville Peninsula]], and in other Inuit communities in the far north of [[Nunavut]], like [[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]], [[Grise Fiord]], [[Pond Inlet]], [[Clyde River, Nunavut|Clyde River]], and [[Arctic Bay]].

The governments of Nunavut and the [[Northwest Territories]] generally consider it to be a dialect of [[Inuktitut]], due to its location in Nunavut, as do some linguists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitree.org/trees/Eskimo%20Aleut:%20Goddard%201996@10422]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is instead sometimes classified as a dialect of [[Inuvialuktun]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/map/CA___]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Inuktitut and Inuvialuktun form a [[dialect continuum]] with few sharp boundaries.

The North Baffin dialect is the spoken in the film ''[[Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner]]''.

[[Image:Méthamphétamine pure.jpg|thumb|[[Methamphetamine]] is the drug most associated with the term "party and play".]]

'''Party and play''', '''party 'n' play''' ('''PNP''' or '''PnP'''), or '''chemsex''' is the consumption of drugs to facilitate [[sexual activity]]. Sociologically, both terms refer to a [[subculture]] of [[recreational drug]] users who engage in high-risk [[sexual activities]] under the influence of drugs within groups.&lt;ref name="metroweekly.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title=PSA tackles ''PNP'': TV ad warns against crystal meth usage in the gay male community |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/gauge/?ak=2025 |date=2007-09-21 |accessdate=2015-12-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921093652/http://www.metroweekly.com/gauge/?ak=2025 |archivedate=September 21, 2007 |website=metroweekly.com |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drug of choice is typically [[methamphetamine]], known as ''tina'' or ''T'',&lt;ref name="brown2002"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crystal Ball|url = http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/gay/features/5948/index.html|website = NYMag.com|accessdate = 2015-12-11|date = April 29, 2002|last = Brown|first = Ethan}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other drugs are also used, such as [[mephedrone]], [[Γ-hydroxybutyrate|GHB]], [[Γ-butyrolactone|GBL]]&lt;ref name="bmj2015-11-03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCall|first=Hannah|last2=Adams|first2=Naomi|last3=Mason|first3=David|last4=Willis|first4=Jamie|date=2015-11-03|title=What is chemsex and why does it matter?|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h5790|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=351|pages=h5790|doi=10.1136/bmj.h5790|issn=1756-1833|pmid=26537832}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[alkyl nitrites]] (known as [[poppers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/poppers-how-gay-culture-bottled-a-formula-that-has-broken-down-boundaries-a6828466.html|title=How gay culture bottled a formula that has broken down boundaries|date=2016-01-22|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have found that people participating in such sex parties have a higher probability of acquiring [[sexually transmitted disease]]s by having [[unprotected sex|unprotected]] [[anal sex]] with large numbers of sexual partners. For this reason, "chemsex" has been described as "a public health priority".&lt;ref name="bmj2015-11-03" /&gt;

==Participants==
Methamphetamine is often used recreationally for its effects as a potent [[aphrodisiac]], [[euphoriant]], and stimulant.&lt;ref name="SF Meth"&gt;{{cite AV media |date=August 2013 |title=San Francisco Meth Zombies |medium=TV documentary |url= |publisher=National Geographic Channel |asin=B00EHAOBAO }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been further described that "an entire subculture known as party and play is based around methamphetamine use."&lt;ref name="SF Meth" /&gt;  Gay men belonging to this subculture will typically meet up through internet dating sites to have sex.&lt;ref name="SF Meth" /&gt;  On such sites, men often include notations such as "chems" or "PNP".&lt;ref name="SF Meth" /&gt;  Since stimulant drugs such as methamphetamine drastically delay the need for [[sleep]], increase [[sexual arousal]], and tend to inhibit [[ejaculation]], PNP sexual encounters can continue for many hours.&lt;ref name="SF Meth" /&gt; 

Methamphetamine taken in excess of amounts prescribed or recommended will prolong symptoms of intoxication for up to eight hours.&lt;ref name="Desoxyn"&gt;{{cite web| title=Desoxyn Prescribing Information| url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/005378s028lbl.pdf| work=United States Food and Drug Administration| accessdate=31 December 2013|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these sexual encounters will sometimes occur continuously for several days along with repeated methamphetamine use.&lt;ref name="SF Meth" /&gt; The crash following the use of methamphetamine in this manner is very often severe, with marked [[hypersomnia]].&lt;ref name="SF Meth" /&gt;

Internet posts by men seeking PNP experiences often resort to slang to identify what drug they are partying with.&lt;ref name="Frederick, B.J. 2012"&gt;Frederick, B.J. (2012). Partying with a purpose: Finding meaning in an online "party 'n' play" subculture [Masters thesis]. California State University, Long Beach.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Party N Play" on the Internet: Subcultural Formation, Craigslist, and Escaping from Stigma|journal = Deviant Behavior|date = 2014-11-02|issn = 0163-9625|pages = 859–884|volume = 35|issue = 11|doi = 10.1080/01639625.2014.897116|first = Brian J.|last = Frederick|first2 = Dina|last2 = Perrone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These drugs tend to inhibit [[penis|penile]] [[erection]],&lt;ref name="SF Meth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Desoxyn" /&gt; a phenomenon known by the slang term ''crystal penis'' or ''pilly willy''.  Consequently, many men who engage in PNP use [[erectile dysfunction]] drugs such as [[sildenafil]], [[vardenafil]], and [[tadalafil]].&lt;ref name=race2009pleasureconsuming&gt;Race K (2009): ''Pleasure Consuming Medicine: The queer politics of drugs'' Durham: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

For some PNP participants, substance use may facilitate  a process of "cognitive disengagement" from the fears and stipulations associated with sex in the time of [[HIV/AIDS]]. Popular discourses of "disinhibition" provide a commonly accepted alibi for activities engaged in when under the influence of substances.&lt;ref name=race2009pleasureconsuming/&gt;

==Medical risks==
The same drug-induced loss of inhibitions makes PNP enthusiasts more vulnerable to more immediate threats, such as [[robbery]], [[date rape]], or [[assault]], or [[murder]], by someone whom they meet for sex.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick, BJ (11 July 2013). Dangerous Liaisons: The Risks of Using Gay/MSM 'Hookup' Technologies [Conference presentation]. International Congress on Gender Violence, International Institute for the Sociology of Law, Onati, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; The term party and play - ''and pay'' has emerged as a warning that partying and playing leads to [[bareback sex]] which increases the chances of contracting HIV and may result in other consequences such as neurological damage&lt;ref name=Brecht2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brecht, M.L. |author2=O’brien, A. |author3=Von Mayrhauser, C. |author4=Anglin, M.D. |year=2004 |title=Methamphetamine use behaviors and gender differences |journal=Addict Behav |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=89–106 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4603(03)00082-0 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306460303000820  |accessdate=2007-08-18 |pmid=14667423 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and resistance to HIV drugs.&lt;ref name="Frederick, B.J. 2012"/&gt;

Methamphetamine can cause sores and abrasions in the mouth which can turn typically low-HIV-risk sex acts such as oral sex into very-high-risk sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Queer Issue: The Crystal Crisis |url=http://villagevoice.com/people/0525,qmoore,65112,24.html |date=June 17, 2005 |accessdate=2015-12-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206130557/http://villagevoice.com/people/0525%2Cqmoore%2C65112%2C24.html |last=Moore |first=Patrick |archivedate=February 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Saynotomethandbareback.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"Say no to Meth and Bareback"]] --&gt;
Men who PNP with methamphetamine, [[cocaine]], [[MDMA]], and [[ketamine]] are twice as likely to have unprotected sex (meaning sex without using a condom), according to British research from 2006. The study also found that up to 20% of gay men from central London gyms had tried methamphetamine, the drug most associated with PNPing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Up to 20 per cent of gay men have tried crystal meth|url = http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-1974.html|website = PinkNews|accessdate = 2015-12-11|date = 2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and cultural significance==

Subcultures of psychoactive drug use have long existed within urban gay communities, since the disco era and before.  These substances have been used for dancing, socializing, communal celebration and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Race, K. (2011). Party Animals: The significance of drug practices in the materialization of urban gay identity. In Suzanne Fraser and David Moore (Eds.), The Drug Effect: Health, Crime and Society, (pp. 35-56). Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of online websites and hookup apps in the 1990s gave men new ways of cruising and meeting sexual partners, including the ability to arrange private sexual gatherings in their homes.&lt;ref name=race2015&gt;{{Cite journal|title = ‘Party and Play’: Online hook-up devices and the emergence of PNP practices among gay men|url = http://sex.sagepub.com/content/18/3/253|journal = Sexualities|date = 2015-03-01|issn = 1363-4607|pages = 253–275|volume = 18|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/1363460714550913|language = en|first = Kane|last = Race}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 2000s, historic venues of gay socialization such as bars, clubs, and dance events reduced in number in response to a range of factors, including gentrification, zoning laws, licensing restrictions, and the increased number of closeted or under the influence sexually labile men, and the increasing popularity of digital technologies for sexual and social purposes.&lt;ref name=race2014&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Complex Events: Drug Effects and Emergent Causality|url = http://cdx.sagepub.com/content/41/3/301|journal = Contemporary Drug Problems|date = 2014-09-01|issn = 0091-4509|pages = 301–334|volume = 41|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/009145091404100303|language = en|first = Kane|last = Race}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, PNP emerged as an alternative form of sexualized partying that enabled participants to avoid the public scrutiny and potentially judgmental and anxiety provoking nature of the "public space".  Newly popular drugs such as methamphetamine and GHB/GBL replaced dance drugs such as ecstasy within this context.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

While PNP sessions tend to be organized around sex, there is some evidence that they can serve a range of social purposes for their participants, including the opportunity to meet other gay men, become friends, and engage in erotic play and experimentation. In some instances, PNP sessions play a part in the formation of loose social networks that are valued and relied upon by participants.&lt;ref name=race2015/&gt; For other men, increasing reliance on [[hookup app]]s and websites to arrange sex may result in a sense of isolation that may exacerbate the risk of drug dependence, especially in the context of a lack of other venues for gay socializing and sexual community-formation.&lt;ref name=race2014/&gt;

== Criticism ==
It has been observed that reliable data and relevant research are generally lacking and this situation is generating a climate of [[moral panic]]. In an article published by ''[[The Guardian]]'', it has been argued that an exaggerated reporting might give the public a distorted impression of the magnitude of this phenomenon – and that can only increase the level of collective anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/10/gay-men-chemsex-moral-panic|title=Gay men need clear information about ‘chemsex’, not messages about morality|date=2015-11-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Power Summit''', previously known as '''Mixshow Power Summit''', is an annual four-day urban music conference. It was established in 1998 by Rene McLean, founder and CEO of RPM GRP.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-10-19/news/0110190097_1_hip-hop-music-executives-djs| title=Disc Jockeys Spininto South Beach| author=Akilah Johnson| date=October 19, 2001| publisher=Sun Sentinel| accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference ran for ten years, concluding in 2008.

==Overview==
Power Summit was a four-day conference for radio, mixshow and club [[disc jockeys]] around the world. The conference included performances from featured artists, keynote speakers, panels, showcases, the Mixshow Power Summit Awards, meet-and-greets and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=In the Mix: The Mixshow Power Summit in P.R. Was Not to be Missed| author=Mark Allwood| date=March 2005| publisher=Swede magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1998, the conference was established by Rene McLean of RPM. The location of the event changed from year to year, sometimes remaining in the same destination for up to three years in a row.&lt;ref name=bill&gt;{{cite journal| title=Beats &amp; Rhymes In The Mix| publisher=Billboard| page=22| date=October 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science fiction studies''' is the common name for the [[academic discipline]] that studies and researches the history, culture, and works of [[science fiction]] and, more broadly, [[speculative fiction]].

==History of the field as a discipline==

The modern field of science fiction studies is closely related to [[popular culture studies]], a subdiscipline of [[cultural studies]], and [[film studies|film]] and [[literary criticism|literature]] studies.  Because of the ties with [[Futures studies|futurism]] and [[utopian]] works, there is often overlap with these fields as well.  The field also has spawned subfields, such as [[feminist science fiction]] studies. 

However, the field's roots go back much further, to the earliest commentators who studied representations of the sciences in the arts and literature, and explorations of utopian and social reform impulses in fantastic and visionary works of art and literature. 

Modern science fiction criticism may have started with [[Dorothy Scarborough]], who in 1917 included a chapter on "Supernatural Science" in her doctoral dissertation, published as ''The Supernatural in Modern English Fiction''.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Scarborough, "Supernatural Science," in ''The Supernatural in Modern English Fiction''. New York: Putnam, 1917, pp. 251-280. See also the Scarborough entry in "Horny Toads and Ugly Chickens: A Bibliography on Texas in Speculative Fiction," by Bill Page, Texas A&amp;M Cushing Library, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] era progressed, shifting science fiction ever further into popular culture, groups of writers, editors, publishers, and fans (often scientists, academics, and scholars of other fields) systematically organized publishing enterprises, conferences, and other insignia of an academic discipline. Much discussion about science fiction took place in the letter columns of early [[science fiction magazine|SF magazines]] and [[science fiction fanzines|fanzines]], and the first book of commentary on science fiction in the US was Clyde F. Beck's ''Hammer and Tongs'', a [[chapbook]] of essays originally published in a fanzine.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nicholls, "Critical and Historical Works About SF," in [[John Clute|Clute, John]], [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]], eds., ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' (St. Martin's Press, 1995) {{ISBN|0-312-13486-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1940s saw the appearance of three full-scale scholarly works that treated science fiction and its literary ancestors: Philip Babcock Gove's ''The Imaginary Voyage in Prose Fiction'' (1941), J. O. Bailey's ''Pilgrims Through Space and Time'' (1948), and Marjorie Hope Nicholson's ''Voyages to the Moon'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, "Critical and Historical Works About SF"; and "Chronological Bibliography of Science Fiction History, Theory, and Criticism" at http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/biblio.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] credits [[Sam Moskowitz]] with teaching "what was almost certainly the first sf course in the USA to be given through a college": a non-credit course in "Science Fiction Writing" at [[City College of New York]] in 1953. The first regular, for-credit courses were taught by Mark Hillegas (at [[Colgate University|Colgate]]) and H. Bruce Franklin (at [[Stanford University|Stanford]]) in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;"SF in the Classroom" in the Clute &amp; Nicholls ''Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, more science fiction scholars began to move into the academy, founding [[academic journal]]s devoted to the exploration of the literature and works of science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Science-Fiction Studies]], founded 1973. See also bibliographies such as ''The Year's Scholarship in Science Fiction and Fantasy'', edited by Marshall B. Tymn, several volumes of which were published through the 1970s through Kent State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kincaid, “Learned Journals,” The Times Literary Supplement (March 7, 2003): 24-25 (reviewing the three primary theoretical journals of science fiction studies).&lt;/ref&gt;  The explosion of [[film studies]] and [[cultural studies]] more broadly granted the nascent discipline additional credibility, and throughout the 1970s and 1980s, mainstream scholars such as [[Susan Sontag]]&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Susan Sontag, "The Imagination of Disaster," in ''Against Interpretation'' (New York: Farrar, 1966), pp. 209-225.&lt;/ref&gt; turned their critical attention to science fiction. 

In 1982, [[James_Gunn_(author)|James Gunn]] (now Emeritus Professor) established the [[Center for the Study of Science Fiction]] as a Kansas Board of Regents Center as a focus for the SF programs he offered at the [[University of Kansas]], beginning in 1969. This was the first such SF organization at a major university.&lt;ref&gt;CSSF website, [http://www.sfcenter.ku.edu/index.html "History"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw the first academic programs and degree-granting programs established,&lt;ref&gt;The [[University of Liverpool]], first.&lt;/ref&gt; and the field shows continued steady growth, not surprisingly also at technology-oriented institutions.&lt;ref&gt; Lisa Yaszek, "Amazing Stories, or, Why We Do Science Fiction," in: ''Humanistic Perspectives in a Technological World''," ed. Richard Utz, Valerie B. Johnson, and Travis Denton (Atlanta: Georgia Institute of Technology, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Additional academic programs and graduate programs added at other schools.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AALMOZNINO4.JPG|thumb|right|[[Albert Almoznino]]'s shadow art]] --&gt;
{{Performing arts}}
'''Shadowgraphy''' or '''ombromanie''' is the art of performing a story or show using images made by hand shadows. It can be called "cinema in silhouette". Performers are titled as a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.

The art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight; therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.

The modern art of hand shadows was made popular by the French entertainer [[Félicien Trewey]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quick-change-artistry.com/shadowgraphy.html Quick Change Artistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized the art by making silhouettes of famous personalities.

== Origin ==
Since shadows have existed since the existence of objects obstructing light, it is hard to say when the art was first used by humans for entertainment. It could have been practiced by ancient or later humans, but it probably originated in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Art of Hand Shadows by Albert Almoznino&lt;/ref&gt; The French entertainer Félicien Trewey was interested in the art of Chinese [[shadow puppet]]ry called Ombres Chinoises, which means "Chinese shadows". He popularized the art of hand shadows when he developed shadows of famous silhouettes. It then became popular in [[Europe]] in the 19th century.

== Prevalence ==
Although the art is popular amongst different kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Shadowgraphy Shadowgraphy - MagicPedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Félicien Trewey perfected the widely known elephant, bird, and cat hand shadows&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/4/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and created some of his own such as The Volunteer, [[Robinson Crusoe]], The Jockey, The Rope Dancer and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/6/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Trewey joined with [[Alexander Herrmann]] who most likely learned it from him. David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son [[Okito]] (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to ''his'' son [[David (Fu Manchu) Bamberg|Fu Manchu]] (David Theodore Bamberg). Fu Manchu passed his skill to Marcelo Contento, one of his apprentices, who became famous worldwide for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MUM Magazine, March 2000|last=|first=|publisher=Society of American Magicians|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=26|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contento died before he could pass it on to his son.

Other magicians who used hand shadows in their act include [[David Devant]], [[Edward Victor]], and the duo [[Max Holden (magic)|Holden and Graham]] in which Holden was famous for his "Monkey in the Belfry" shadow.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"/&gt;

== Tools ==

=== Hands ===
[[File:Gale's Guernsey shadowgraphy.jpg|thumb|right|An 1889 advertisement with examples of hand shadows]]
The hands and fingers are exercised and different finger positions are practiced to help aid in forming shadows.

=== Light source ===
The light source to be used should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light proceeding from the smallest possible point.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, ''Modern Conjuring For Amateurs'', that the best source of light is the [[electric arc]], which Almoznino agrees to the small [[arc lamp]], and the second best being the [[limelight]] (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists is the use of [[acetylene gas]] (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or [[carbide lamp]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.

=== Blank surface ===
Albert Almoznino suggests to use a white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of [[muslin]] or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a [[rear projection screen]], but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Performance ==
The performer sits or stands between the light source and the blank surface, while having the option to perform in front of the performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be about six feet. The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.

Movement helps give the shadows character and brings them to life. Some shadows are performed with accessories attached to the hands or fingers to achieve movements or images not applicable to hands alone.

"'''Shattered Grid'''" is a 2018 crossover comic book event published by [[Boom! Studios]], in collaboration with [[Saban Capital Group#Saban Brands|Saban Brands]], which was later replaced by [[Hasbro]]. Based on the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise by [[Haim Saban]], it was mostly written by [[Kyle Higgins]] and Ryan Parrott through the ongoing comic series ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' and ''Go Go Power Rangers'' to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the original television series.

==Publication history==
On December 2017, Boom! Studios announced "Shattered Grid" as a crossover event between ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' and ''Go Go Power Rangers'', which would feature teams from all eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/12/04/every-power-ranger-ever-assembles-in-shattered-grid-event|title=EVERY POWER RANGER EVER ASSEMBLES FOR 'SHATTERED GRID' EVENT|first=Joshua|last=Yehl|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=December 4, 2017|accessdate=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main story was mostly written by [[Kyle Higgins]] through ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', while Ryan Parrott has also written a tie-in story through ''Go Go Power Rangers'', featuring Lord Drakkon and the Ranger Slayer as exclusive characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/powerrangers/2018/03/28/power-rangers-shattered-grid-breaking-down-ranger-slayer/|title=Power Rangers Shattered Grid: Breaking Down The Ranger Slayer|first=Matthew|last=Mueller|publisher=ComicBook.com|date=March 28, 2018|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2018, an online advertisement promoting the comic was broadcast, featuring [[Jason David Frank]] in a voice-over narration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/02/06/frank-shattered-grid-power-rangers/|title=Jason David Frank Returns to Power Rangers to Voice Lord Drakkon in Shattered Grid Trailer|first=Jude|last=Terror|publisher=Bleeding Cool|date=February 6, 2018|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2018, a promotional short film titled ''Power Rangers: Shattered Grid - Dark Prelude'' was released online, starring Frank in the role of Lord Drakkon. The film was written and directed by Higgins and produced by Locomotion Pictures, RCA Film Productions and Saban Brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/23/power-rangers-jason-david-frank-plays-lord-drakkon-in-live-action-shattered-grid-trailer|title=POWER RANGERS' JASON DAVID FRANK PLAYS LORD DRAKKON IN LIVE-ACTION 'SHATTERED GRID' TRAILER|first=Joshua|last=Yehl|publisher=IGN|date=March 23, 2018|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
===Prelude===
In an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate universe]], [[Tommy Oliver]] refused to join the Power Rangers and stayed loyal to [[Rita Repulsa]], taking the name of "Lord Drakkon" after a former acolyte of Rita. Together, they conquered [[Earth]] and killed [[Zordon]], [[Jason Lee Scott|Jason Scott]], [[Billy Cranston]], among others. At some point, Drakkon also killed Rita to form his own army, including [[Scorpina]], Finster 5, and a brainwashed [[Kimberly Ann Hart|Kimberly Hart]] as the Ranger Slayer. To fight this treat, [[Zack Taylor]] and [[Trini Kwan]] founded "The Coinless", a resistance movement that opposes Drakkon's regime. Additionally, another Tommy and his fellow Rangers confronted him, destroying his Power Coin in the process. As they returned to their universe, Drakkon was wrongly transported with them. After his arrival, he was taken prisoner by Promethea agents.

After Promethea held Drakkon in a special top secret containment area for an unknown amount of time, Saba appears to kill him for all of his horrible acts. But Saba fails, accidentally freeing Drakkon, who decapitates him and takes his headless sword body to open a portal and escape.

Arriving to the past, the Ranger Slayer joins forces with Rita Repulsa to power-up the Gravezord, so she could deliver the Chaos Crystal back to Lord Drakkon.

===Main story===
A mysterious rift is investigated by the [[Power Rangers Time Force|Time Force Rangers]] in the future and when they get close to it, the Time Force Megazord is ravaged and it becomes nearly inescapable for [[Jen Scotts]] but they travel to the past.

Grace Sterling (Director of Promethea) is confronted by Jason and Tommy in the present due to her hiding Lord Drakkon without them knowing.

Drakkon travels back to their dimension and deceives Ninjor, the creator of the Power Coins, into repairing his ranger powers.  A thankful Drakkon captures Ninjor inside a magic bottle, intending to exploit his knowledge of the Morphin Grid for his own ends.  The Rangers plan their recourse while in the Command Center, while Billy expresses his desire for Trini's help in making the Black Dragon work again in their desire to warn of Drakkon's possible return to the Coinless and to surround the Command Center with a barrier. Unbeknownst to the Rangers, Drakkon infiltrates the Command Center and steals back the Chaos Crystal.

A downtime by Tommy and Kimberly to find peace during their first date is ruined near the end of it as Kim rebuffed Tommy's attempted kiss of her.

Feeling terrible about this, Tommy was trailed by Kimberly as he left and when she caught up, Lord Drakkon appeared and stabbed Tommy though his back, zapping the energy from Tommy into the stolen Chaos Crystal.

Kim was joined by Jen in her fight against Drakkon but Drakkon escaped back to his world while Kimberly held a dying Tommy's body.

The Rangers (in the past) freed her from the mind control of the Slayer/Drakkon's mind control, revealing his true identity to this world's Matthew Cook (her late boyfriend).

The arrow she uses is generated by the Chaos Crystal versus a younger version of Tommy Oliver and this transfers memories about probable futures which includes his impending death by Drakkon.

Tommy's dream is confirmed by Zordon in the present leading the Rangers to place his body back in the alley. This is done for the police to locate his him.

At Tommy's funeral, the announcement of Jen being awake is made by Alpha. The other Rangers are warned by Jen (in the Command Center) of the timeline's fracturing at the hands of the Morphin Grid. Drakkon's status invading both worlds in a power gaining attempt is also announced.

Most of the [[Power Rangers Samurai|Samurai Rangers]] were taken and their morphers are stolen by Drakkon who uses Ninjor in his transfer of their energy and he evolves into his next form.

The Emissaries are contacted by Zordon in an attempt to convince the Morphin Masters to remove the power from Drakkon, but the plea is ignored, which denies that Drakkon's army and him are dangerous enough threats to the Grid. All possible versions of Tommy are murdered by Drakkon, but Dr K is failed to recruit and its discovered how to reverse the Dragon Cannons' effect.

The Ranger Slayer (now in the present) by Grace Sterling and the Prometha agency was taken asylum.

The Rangers use the Black Dragon and Time Force Technologies from the Command Center in an effort to contact Dr K and the [[Power Rangers RPM|RPM Rangers]] which leads them to see that Drakkon once again evolved and is now joined by the [[Psycho Rangers]] (the S.P.D A-Squad and Koragg the Knight Wolf join him as new allies)

Ninjor is rescued in the World of the Coinless and the revelation by him is said that Drakkon is conquering the Rangers in an attempt to get access to the Morphin Grid

All Rangers travel to the [[Moon]] (using Grace Sterling's space colony (which [[Karone]] recognizes as [[Terra Venture]]) ) to confront Drakkon's forces. This is done as Rita Repulsa is turned by Zordon to supress Drakkon's power. Finster 5 electrifies them which saves Drakkon who connects more morphin energy to himself in his bid to evolve into his final form.

The Rangers destroy Drakkon's tower on the Moon, which cuts off the Sentries' power causing a giant rift. 

In his final form, Lord Drakkon enters the Morphin Grid, defeats the Emissaries and takes possession of the Heart of one of the Morphin Masters, destroying the [[multiverse]] and creating his own world where he is a hero.

Luckily for Tommy, he had actually survived his death, with the Ranger Slayer's attack in the past overcharging him with Chaos Energy and pulling his spirit inside Drakkon, taunting him enough to loosen his hold on his power just enough to free him and the Emissaries and rescuing the Rangers. Together, they are able to finally pull the Heart from Drakkon, causing his world to collapse. Despite Tommy's attempt to help him, Drakkon refuses to be saved and stays in his collapsing world.

With the Heart of the Master secured, the Emissaries aid the Rangers in using it to repair the damage Drakkon caused, but they also tell them that it cannot be completely fixed.

===Aftermath===
While the multiverse and the timestream were fixed, the exact level of repair is currently unknown. As well, the Terra Venture colony has been dislodged from time and space, casting Grace, her crew and the surviving Rangers into uncharted territory.

Back in the past, Matthew is now fully aware of the Rangers' identity and insists Kimberly and the others to entrust their secret, but they refuse to answer, causing a permanent friction between them. In the meantime, Rita has a new plan to destroy the Rangers once and for all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9518">'''The Sport Literature Association (SLA)''', headquartered at [[East Tennessee State University]], is an international organization devoted to the study of sport in literature and culture.  With a membership numbering several hundred scholars, students, and readers from around the world, SLA sponsors an annual conference in a different North American location each summer.  Its [http://www.uta.edu/english/sla/program2011.html 28th such conference] was held at the [[University of Maine]], Orono, June 22–25, 2011.  SLA is an affiliate of the American Literature Association, and the publications of SLA members are indexed by the [[Modern Language Association]], American Humanities Index, [[Gale (publisher)]], and [[EBSCO Publishing]]. The president of the organization for 2011-12 is Dennis Gildea of [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)]].

==History==

SLA was organized in 1983 at [[San Diego State University]], by Lyle Olsen, a physical education professor and former minor league baseball player and college baseball coach; Alfred F. Boe, an English and comparative literature professor; and a number of their colleagues.  The stated purpose of the organization was “to encourage, stimulate, and foster the alliance of sport with the humanities” &lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Jarold Ramsey, "Sports-Related Literature Is the Focus of a Worthwhile New Journal," ''Sports Illustrated'' 6 August 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization’s first president was Ralph M. Grawunder, another physical education professor at SDSU. Other individuals crucially involved in the early development of the organization were Richard W. Wells, Virginia L. Evans, and Susan Bandy of San Diego State University; Thomas F. Scanlon of University of California, Riverside; Eric Solomon of San Francisco State University; Michael Oriard of Oregon State University; Elizabeth S. Bressan of the University of Oregon; Richard Keller of Emporia State University; Mary McElroy of Kansas State University; Richard Doxtator of the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point; Robert J. Higgs and Donald Johnson of East Tennessee State University; David Vanderwerken of Texas Christian University; Richard C. Crepeau of the University of Central Florida; and Christian L. Messenger of University of Illinois at Chicago Circle.

==Annual Conference==
 
The SLA’s first annual conference met at the University of California, San Diego, in La Jolla, July 26–28, 1984.  The program chair was Susan Bandy.  In addition to 15 sessions of papers and panels, that conference featured special lectures in honor of three individuals who are leading figures in the area of sports literature:  [[Mark Harris (author)|Mark Harris]], author of ''Bang the Drum Slowly'' and other highly acclaimed baseball novels; Eleanor Metheny, influential physical educator and author who championed women’s equality in sports; and Robert J. Higgs, author of ''Laurel &amp; Thorn: The Athlete in American Literature'',&lt;ref&gt;University Press of Kentucky, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the pioneering studies in sport literature, and co-editor of ''The Sporting Spirit'',&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Higgs and Neil D. Isaacs, eds., ''The Sporting Spirit: Athletes in Literature and Life'' (New York:  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; a popular sports literature anthology. Higgs, who would become one of the most prominent and influential members of SLA, was further honored by the organization with a publication of a festschrift, ''One for the Higger: Jack Higgs, A Man for All Seasons'',&lt;ref&gt;[Johnson City, TN: East Tennessee State University Press, 1994].&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994; and he was presented the organization’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008.

==Journal==

The inaugural issue of the organization’s journal, ''Arete: The Journal of Sport Literature'', with Lyle Olsen as founding editor and Alfred Boe as associate editor, was the Fall 1983 number (published in 1984).  Section editors of that first issue included:  Boe (fiction), Scanlon (ancient sport literature), Bandy (journal survey), Bruce Weigl of Old Dominion University (poetry), Fred S. Moramarco of San Diego State University (book reviews), Tim Wulfemeyer of the University of Hawaii at Manoa (sports journalism), Walter Harrison of Colorado College (cinema), Laurel Dean of University of California, San Diego (student contributions), and James C. Hinkle of San Diego State University (copy editor).  The editorial board consisted of Boe, Dean, Grawunder, Hinkle, Moramarco, and Oriard.  Robert Hamblin of Southeast Missouri State University became poetry editor with the second issue of the journal in Spring 1984 and continued in that capacity until 2005.

The journal’s name was changed to ''Aethlon: The Journal of Sport Literature'' in 1988, and the following year the publication offices for the journal moved to East Tennessee State University when Olsen joined the faculty there, where he continued to provide leadership for SLA and ''Aethlon'' until his death in 2000.  Don Johnson, professor of English at East Tennessee State University, served as the general editor of ''Aethlon'' from 1988 until 2005; Joyce Duncan, an instructor at ETSU, is the current editor, having assumed the position with the Fall 2005 issue.  Duncan has also served as managing editor of SLA since 1993.

==Website==

The SLA [http://www.uta.edu/english/sla website] was established by Tim Morris, professor of English at the [[University of Texas at Arlington]]. The website hosts a moderated email discussion list; posts book reviews, information on the annual conferences, and calls for papers for ''Aethlon: The Journal of Sport Literature''; and archives “Sport and Society” columns by Richard C. Crepeau, a longtime SLA member, professor of history at the University of Central Florida, and one of the leading commentators on the role of sports in American society. The SLA's e-mail discussion list, [http://www.uta.edu/english/sla/arete.html ARETE], is moderated by Frank Fury of Monmouth University.

'''''The Incredible Shrinking Fireman''''' is a [[computer game]] released by [[Mastertronic]] in {{vgy|1986}}. It was programmed by Andy Mitchell&lt;ref name="giantlist"/&gt; with art by David Kidd.

==Game Objective==
While beating back the flames of a blazing fire in a vast shrinking plant, Shuffling Sid fell into the jaws of a powerful shrinking machine and, not surprisingly, was shrunk.  To unshrink shrunken Shuffling Sid, stretch him!  To do this you will have to find the five parts of the Stretching Rack and put them together.  After which Shuffling Sid will return to his original size.  Not all the objects that you find will be useful.  Not all exits will be obvious - try jumping up through the ceiling of some rooms and they will lead into different areas of the factory - and some of your exits will not be open until you have found the right object to let you pass through. But most of all beware
of the ghosts and ghouls that haunt the factory!

Can you unshrink shrunken Shuffling Sid?

'''''The Mysterious Island''''' ({{lang-fr|L'Île mystérieuse}}) is a novel by [[Jules Verne]], published in [[1874 in literature|1874]]. The original edition, published by [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel|Hetzel]], contains a number of illustrations by [[Jules Férat]]. The novel is a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] [[sequel]] to Verne's famous ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' and ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]'', though its themes are vastly different from those books. An early draft of the novel, initially rejected by Verne's publisher and wholly reconceived before publication, was titled ''Shipwrecked Family: Marooned With Uncle Robinson,'' seen as indicating the influence of the novels ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unmuseum.org/verne.htm |title=Jules Verne: An Author Before His Time? |year=2002 |first=Lee |last=Krystek |website=The UnMuseum |accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/birs/bir87.htm |title=Books in Review: New Editions of "Classic" SF |journal=[[Science Fiction Studies]] |date=July 2002 |volume=29 |issue=2 |publisher=[[DePauw University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verne developed a similar theme in his later novel, ''[[Godfrey Morgan]]'' (French: ''L'École des Robinsons'', 1882).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nash |first=Andrew |date=27 November 2001 |url=http://www.julesverne.ca/vernebooks/jvbkschool.html |title=École des Robinsons (L') - 1882 |website=JulesVerne.ca |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The plot focuses on the adventures of five Americans on an uncharted island in the [[Australasia|South Pacific]].  During the [[American Civil War]], five northern prisoners of war decide to escape, during the siege of [[Richmond, Virginia]], by hijacking a balloon.

&lt;!-- Please note: the names are correct in original --&gt;
The escapees are [[Cyrus Smith]], a [[railroad]] [[engineer]] in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army (named Cyrus Harding in [[William Henry Giles Kingston|Kingston]]'s version); his ex-slave and loyal follower Neb (short for [[Nebuchadnezzar]]); [[Bonadventure Pencroff]], a [[sailor]] (who is addressed only by his surname; in Kingston's translation, he is named Pencroft); his [[protégé]] and adopted son [[Harbert Brown]] (called Herbert in some translations); and the [[journalist]] [[Gedéon Spilett]] (Gideon Spilett in English versions). The company is completed by Cyrus' dog "Top".{{Ref|orig-names|a}}

After flying in a great storm for several days, the group crash-lands on a cliff-bound, volcanic, unknown island, described as being located at {{coord|34|57|S|150|30|W}}, about {{convert|2500|km|mi}} east of New Zealand. They name it "Lincoln Island" in honor of their president, [[Abraham Lincoln]]. With the knowledge of the brilliant engineer Smith, the five are able to sustain themselves on the island, producing fire, pottery, bricks, [[nitroglycerin]], iron, a simple electric [[telegraph]], a home on a stony cliffside called "Granite House", and even a seaworthy ship, which they name the "Bonadventure" (in honor of Pencroff, the driving force behind its construction). They also manage to figure out their geographical location.
[[File:Ile Mysterieuse 03.jpg|left|thumb|Map of "Lincoln Island"]]

During their stay on the island, the group endures bad weather, and domesticates an [[orangutan]], Jupiter, abbreviated to Jup (or Joop, in Jordan Stump's translation). There is a mystery on the island in the form of an unseen ''[[deus ex machina]]'', responsible for Cyrus' survival after falling from the balloon, the mysterious rescue of Top from a [[dugong]], the appearance of a box of equipment (guns and ammunition, tools, etc.), and other seemingly inexplicable occurrences.

The group finds a [[message in a bottle]] directing them to rescue a [[castaway]] on nearby [[Maria Theresa Reef|Tabor Island]], who is none other than [[Tom Ayrton]] (from ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''). On the return voyage to Lincoln Island, they lose their way in a tempest but are guided back to their course by a mysterious fire beacon.

Ayrton's former companions arrive by chance on Lincoln Island, and try to make it into their lair. After some fighting with the protagonists, the pirate ship is mysteriously destroyed by an explosion. Six of the pirates survive and kidnap Ayrton. When the colonists go to look for him, the pirates shoot Harbert, seriously injuring him. Harbert survives, but suffers from his injury, narrowly cheating death. The colonists at first assume Ayrton to have been killed, but later they find evidence that he was not instantly killed, leaving his fate uncertain. When the colonists rashly attempt to return to Granite House before Harbert fully recovers, Harbert contracts [[malaria]] and is saved by a box of quinine sulphate, which mysteriously appears on the table in Granite House. After Harbert recovers, they attempt to rescue Ayrton and destroy the pirates. They discover Ayrton at the sheepfold, and the pirates dead, without any visible wounds.

The secret of the island is revealed when it is discovered to be [[Captain Nemo]]'s hideout, and home port of the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]''. Having escaped the Maelstrom at the end of ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', the ''Nautilus'' sailed the oceans of the world until all its crew except Nemo had died. Now an old man with a beard, Nemo returned the ''Nautilus'' to its secret port within Lincoln Island. Nemo had been the mysterious benefactor of the settlers, providing them with the box of equipment, sending the message revealing Ayrton, planting the torpedo that destroyed the pirate ship, and killing the pirates with an "electric gun". On his death bed Captain Nemo reveals his true identity as the lost Indian Prince Dakkar, son of a [[Raja]] of the then independent territory of [[Bundelkhand|Bundelkund]] and a nephew of the Indian hero [[Tipu Sultan|Tippu-Sahib]]. After taking part in the failed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Prince Dakkar escaped to a [[desert island]] with twenty of his compatriots and commenced the building of the ''Nautilus'' and adopted the new name of "Captain Nemo". Nemo also tells his life story to [[Cyrus Smith]] and his friends. Before he dies, he gives them a box of diamonds and pearls as a keepsake. Afterwards, he dies, crying "God and my country!" ("Independence!", in Verne's original manuscript). The ''Nautilus'' is scuttled and serves as Captain Nemo's tomb.{{Ref|nemo-time-paradox|b}}

Afterward, the island's central volcano erupts, destroying the island. Jup the orangutan falls into a crack in the ground and dies. The colonists, forewarned of the eruption by Nemo, find themselves safe, but stranded on the last remaining piece of the island above sea level. They are rescued by the ship ''Duncan'', which had come to rescue Ayrton, but were redirected by a message Nemo had previously left on Tabor Island. After they return to United States they form a new colony in Iowa with Nemo's gifts.

==Publication history in English==

In the United States the first English printing began in ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', April 1874, as a serial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Jules |last=Verne |title=The Mysterious Island |magazine=Scribner's Monthly |volume=7 |number=6 |pages=722–734 |date=April 1874 |url=https://archive.org/stream/centuryillustrat07newyuoft#page/722/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1875 Sampson Low, Marston, Low, and Searle published the first British edition of ''Mysterious Island'' in three volumes entitled ''Dropped from the Clouds'', ''The Abandoned'', and ''The Secret of the Island'' (195,000 words).  In November, 1875 Scribner's published the American edition of these volumes from the English plates of Sampson Low. The purported translator, [[William Henry Giles Kingston|W. H. G. Kingston]], was a famous author of boys' adventure and sailing stories who had fallen on hard times in the 1870s due to business failures, and so he hired out to Sampson Low as the translator for these volumes. However, it is now known that the translator of ''Mysterious Island'' and his other Verne novels was actually his wife, Agnes Kinloch Kingston, who had studied on the continent in her youth. The Kingston translation changes the names of the hero from "Smith" to "Harding"; "Smith" is a very common name in the UK and would have been associated, at that time, with the lower classes. In addition many technical passages were abridged or omitted and the anti-imperialist sentiments of the dying Captain Nemo were purged so as not to offend English readers. This became the standard translation for more than a century.

In 1876 the [[Stephen William White|Stephen W. White]] translation (175,000 words) appeared first in the columns of ''The Evening Telegraph'' of Philadelphia and subsequently as an Evening Telegraph Reprint Book. This translation is more faithful to the original story and restores the death scene of Captain Nemo, but there is still condensation and omission of some sections such as Verne's description of how a sawmill works. In the 20th century two more abridged translations appeared: the Fitzroy Edition (Associated Booksellers, 1959) abridged by I. O. Evans (90,000 words) and ''Mysterious Island'' (Bantam, 1970) abridged by Lowell Bair (90,000 words).

Except for the Complete and Unabridged Classics Series CL77 published in 1965 (Airmont Publishing Company, Inc), no other unabridged translations appeared until 2001 when the illustrated version of Sidney Kravitz appeared (Wesleyan University Press) almost simultaneously with the new translation of Jordan Stump published by Random House Modern Library (2001).  Kravitz also translated ''Shipwrecked Family:  Marooned With Uncle Robinson'', published by the North American Jules Verne Society and BearManor Fiction in 2011.

==''Wrecked On A Reef'' influence==
The 2003 English edition of ''Wrecked On A Reef'' (1869), a memoir by French shipwreck survivor [[François Édouard Raynal]], has additional appendices by French scholar Dr Christiane Mortelier who presents a case for the influence of Raynal's book on Verne's ''The Mysterious Island''. The ''[[Grafton (ship)|Grafton]]'' was wrecked near New Zealand on the [[Auckland Islands]] on 3 January 1864, where the crew of five survived for 19 months before obtaining rescue. ''Wrecked On A Reef'', Raynal's memoir of the incident, was very popular at the time of publication, being translated into multiple languages. According to Mortelier, Verne read Raynal's account and loosely based his novel on the true life story of ''Grafton'' shipwreck, survival, privation, and ultimate rescue.

==Translations into other languages==
The novel has been translated into [[Marathi language|Marathi]] by [[Bhaskar Ramachandra Bhagwat|B. R. Bhagwat]] titled 'निर्जन बेटावरचे धाडसी वीर', which roughly translates as "Brave fighters on a deserted island", and has a cult following in [[Maharashtra]]. The novel has also been translated to [[Malayalam]], as ''Nigoodadweep'', translated by  Kesavan Nambisan, and into [[Bengali language|Bengali]] by Shamsuddin Nawab from Sheba Prokashoni in 1979 and entitled ''Rahosshor Dip''.

She finally escapes by locating the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' and disabling the island's defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysteriousislandgame.com/1/uk/ |title=Return To Mysterious Island - Microïds |website=mysteriousislandgame.com |accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 25, 2008 [[Microïds]] ([[Anuman Interactive]]'s adventure games label) announced that a sequel was being made, ''Return to Mysterious Island II''. It has been in development by [[Kheops Studio]] since April 2008, and was released on PC and Apple [[iPhone]] on August 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysteriousislandgame.com/2/en/ |title=Return to Mysterious Island 2 - Mina's fate - Microïds |website=mysteriousislandgame.com |accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also some significance of an adaptation of Captain Nemo and the Mysterious Island in the first arc of the sixth season of Once Upon A Time.

==Notes==
*{{note|orig-names|a}} In the French original, some characters were named a little differently: Gédéon Spillet, Nabuchodonosor (Nab) and Harbert Brown. In the Kingston translation, the engineer is named Cyrus Harding, and the sailor is named Pencroft.
*{{note|nemo-time-paradox|b}} There are discrepancies in [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] between this novel and ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''. Although this novel was written in 1874, its events take place from 1865 to 1869. The events of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' take place between 1867 and 1868. For example, the Captain Nemo appearing in this novel dies at a time when the Captain Nemo in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' was still alive. There is usually a note in most editions of the book admitting date discrepancies. There are also similar discrepancies with ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]'', although, these are not as often pointed out.

'''''The Restaurant at the End of the Universe''''' (1980, {{ISBN|0-345-39181-0}}) is the second book in the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' [[comedy science fiction]] [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)#Series|"trilogy"]] by [[Douglas Adams]], and is a [[sequel]]. It was originally published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Pan Books]] as a paperback. The book was inspired by the song "Grand Hotel" by British rock band [[Procol Harum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Adams|title=[[The Salmon of Doubt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes its name from [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Milliways|Milliways]], the Restaurant at the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|End of the Universe]], one of the settings of the book.

==Plot summary==
''The Restaurant at the End of the Universe'' begins just as ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' ended. [[Arthur Dent]], [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]], [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]], and [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]] have just left the planet [[Magrathea]] when they are attacked by a [[Vogon]] ship. They find they are unable to use the [[Improbability drive]] to escape, as Arthur has accidentally jammed the computer with a simple request for a cup of tea which proved a rather difficult problem. Luckily, an ancestor of Zaphod's, [[Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth]], saves them.

Zaphod and [[Marvin the Paranoid Android|Marvin]] vanish, and reappear at the offices of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy editorial building on [[Ursa Minor Beta]]. They are looking for [[Zarniwoop]], who has gone on an intergalactic cruise in his office via his virtual universe. Arthur, Trillian and Ford are unaware of any of this, knowing only that the computer has been shut down, and only having received a message from a stalling [[Nutrimatic Drink Dispenser|Nutrimatic]] that says "Wait."

When Zaphod and Marvin reach the fifteenth floor of the ''Guide'''s office, half of the building is lifted off the ground by [[Frogstar]] Fighters. A mysterious man named [[Roosta]] brings Zaphod to Zarniwoop's office, where they wait until the building lands on [[Frogstar World B]]. Roosta gives Zaphod final instructions before he leaves: Go through the window on his way out, not the door. Zaphod then meets [[Gargravarr]] who informs Zaphod that he is to be sent through the [[Total Perspective Vortex]], a torture device which can annihilate one's soul by showing them how small they are compared to the size of the Universe. However, when Zaphod enters it, the Vortex shows him that he is one of the most important things in the Universe. Zaphod escapes, and finds Zarniwoop in the first class cabin of a spaceliner in an abandoned spaceport.

Zarniwoop explains that the total Perspective Vortex has not malfunctioned—this is a virtual universe created by Zarniwoop for the sole benefit of Zaphod, making him the most important creature in this universe. It turns out that Zaphod had the shrunk ''[[Heart of Gold (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Heart of Gold]]'' in his jacket pocket the whole time. It is reconstituted, and Zaphod is reunited with Trillian, Arthur and Ford. They escape from Zarniwoop by asking to be transported to the nearest restaurant. Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, is the nearest restaurant in space but not time. They are transported there "five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years" into the future. Marvin is left stranded here for this incredibly vast amount of time parking diners' spaceships while waiting for the humans to return. After the meal, Zaphod and Ford steal a spaceship, which turns out to be a stuntship belonging to the rock band Disaster Area, programmed to dive into a star to provide backing effects for a rock concert. There is a teleporter on the ship for which the guidance system was never built, as it was never intended to be used, and it also requires somebody to stay on the ship to operate it. Marvin is chosen to stay behind and teleport the others, who have no choice but to go wherever it takes them.

Zaphod and Trillian are returned to the ''Heart of Gold'', which is commandeered by Zarniwoop to complete his mission, to discover [[The Ruler of the Universe|who really rules the Universe]]. As it turns out, the Ruler of the Universe is entirely sceptical that he holds this position, as he is entirely sceptical of everything, including whether his cat, The Lord, really exists, or whether there is even a universe at all outside of his small isolated home. While Zarniwoop attempts to impress upon the Ruler of the Universe the reality and the weight of his position, Trillian and Zaphod sneak out and fly the ''Heart of Gold'' away.

The teleporter has meanwhile sent Arthur and Ford to the [[List of races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Golgafrinchans|Golgafrinchan]] Ark Fleet Ship B, a colonial transport [[ship of fools]] - banished from their home planet by their intellectual superiors to colonize elsewhere - which crash-lands on prehistoric Earth. They assume (falsely, it turns out) that the bumbling [[Races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Golgafrinchans|travellers]] are the real ancestors of modern humans. Arthur attempts to determine the Question to [[Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything (42)|the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe and Everything]] by reaching into a [[Scrabble]] bag made from Ford's towel and pulling out letters randomly, hoping [[List of minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]'s computational matrix in Earth would have rubbed off on his subconscious. The letters spell "What do you get when you multiply six by nine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} See this website for possible explanations of this seeming error.&lt;/ref&gt; before running out, although the Neanderthals manage to spell "forty-two" with the tiles, implying that it is they, rather than the Golgafrinchans, who were intended to be part of Earth's computer matrix. After some brief contemplation, Ford and Arthur realise that this is, in fact, a detrimental "cock-up", and that the Earth will never produce the proper Question, thus destroying all hope of ever finding out what it is.

As Ford convinces Arthur that there is nothing that can be done to improve the inevitable history of the Earth, Arthur decides that he should make the best of his situation and settles for a life on prehistoric Earth. (It's also implied that the bumbling fools - banished from their home planet by their intellectual superiors and who end up crash-landing on pre-historic Earth - die out - and that the cave-men neanderthals encountered by Ford and Arthur are in fact the ancestors of Earth's humans).

==Audiobook adaptations==
There have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition, recorded in 1981 by [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]], best known for playing the voice of [[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] in the radio series, LP adaptations and in the TV series. In 1990, Adams himself recorded an unabridged edition, later re-released by New Millennium Audio in the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. In 2006, actor [[Martin Freeman]], who had played [[Arthur Dent]] in the 2005 movie, recorded a new unabridged edition of the audiobook.

===Legislation===
Supported by specific legislation shaped according to regional or local needs.

===Integration===

===Functional framework===
The document finca the library workforce receive necessary continuing professional education.

And there is adapted to the different needs of communities in rural and urban areas.

'''William Spady''' is the head of ChangeLeaders. William Spady is a sociologist and is the father of [[Outcome-based education|Outcome-Based Education]] (OBE). OBE is referred to by over 20 different names including Systemic [[education]] restructuring, [[Performance]] Based Education, [[Standards based education reform]], High Performance [[Learning]], [[Total Quality Management]], Transformational Education, and [[Skill|Competency]]-Based Education.

His research is still widely cited in nations such as Australia which are still adopting OBE. Nevertheless, the names have been changed in the US largely due strong negative responses to these programs when they have been introduced to actual students and parents. All of these titles refer to a similar philosophy and a plan which implements radical and "systemic" change into schools. Many have researched the thousands of articles on the internet referring to Spady, with many showing the beneficial effects of his theories on actual children.&lt;ref&gt;"Last December, the School Board approved the hiring of William Spady of ChangeLeaders, .. is sociologist and the self-proclaimed father of OBE" [http://www.watchd46schools.org/SpadyInfo.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111235313/http://www.watchd46schools.org/SpadyInfo.html |date=2006-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spady was honored for his OBE work in the Philippines in 2015, where they are implementing OBE in some of their schools for grade level 10-12.

Spady is the author or co-author of nine books. His latest book, &lt;u&gt;Bringing Heart and Soul to Education&lt;/u&gt;, was published in 2014.

'''''X-Men: First Class''''' (stylized onscreen as '''''X: First Class''''') is a 2011 American [[superhero film]], based on the [[X-Men]] characters appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. It is the fifth installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]]. It is a [[prequel]] of the franchise and the first film of the X-Men prequel quadrilogy, the film was directed by [[Matthew Vaughn]] and produced by [[Bryan Singer]]. The story is set primarily in 1962 during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and focuses on the relationship between [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] ([[James McAvoy]]), and [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]] ([[Michael Fassbender]]), and the origin of their groups—the [[X-Men]] and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], respectively, as they deal with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] led by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] ([[Kevin Bacon]]), who is bent on world domination. The film co-stars [[Rose Byrne]], [[January Jones]], and [[Oliver Platt]]. The film also introduces new actors to the series including [[Nicholas Hoult]] and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] who, like McAvoy and Fassbender, reimagine popular characters from the franchise ([[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]) that were already established in the original trilogy.

Producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] first thought of a prequel based on the young X-Men during the production of ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', and later producer [[Simon Kinberg]] suggested to [[20th Century Fox]] an adaptation of the comic series ''[[X-Men: First Class (comics)|X-Men: First Class]]'', though the film does not follow the comic closely. Singer, who had directed both ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and ''X2'', became involved with the project in 2009, but he could only produce and co-write ''First Class'' due to other projects. Matthew Vaughn, who was previously attached to both ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', became the director, and also wrote the final script with his writing partner [[Jane Goldman]]. ''First Class'' overtook a planned Magneto prequel that entered [[development hell]] and the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writer's Guild of America]] [[WGA screenwriting credit system|arbitration]] gave a story credit to ''Magneto'' writer [[Sheldon Turner]].

''First Class'' entered production in August 2010, with [[principal photography]] concluding in December and additional filming finishing in April 2011, just a few weeks before the film's premiere in June 2011. The tight schedule proved a challenge to the six companies responsible for the extensive visual effects, which included computer-generated sets and digital doubles for the actors. Locations included [[Oxford]], the [[Mojave desert]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with soundstage work done in both [[Pinewood Studios]] and the [[20th Century Fox]] stages in Los Angeles. The depiction of the 1960s drew inspiration from the [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] films of the period.

''First Class'' was a box-office success, becoming the seventh highest-grossing in the film series, and received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its acting, screenplay, direction, action sequences, visual effects, and musical score. The film's success spawned a number of sequels focusing on younger iterations of the X-Men characters, with ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014), ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016), and the upcoming ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|X-Men: Dark Phoenix]]'' (2019).

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
In 1944, in a [[German camps in occupied Poland during World War II|Nazi death camp]], [[Nazism|Nazi]] scientist [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Klaus Schmidt]]  witnesses a young [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] bend a metal gate with his mind when he is separated from his parents. In his office, Schmidt orders Lehnsherr to move a coin on his desk, and kills the boy's mother when Lehnsherr fails to do so. In grief and rage, Lehnsherr's magnetic power manifests, killing two guards and destroying the room. Meanwhile, at [[X-Mansion|a mansion]] in [[Westchester County, New York]], child [[telepathy|telepath]] [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] meets young shapeshifter [[Mystique (comics)|Raven]], whose natural form is blue-skinned and scaly. Overjoyed to meet someone "different", like himself, he invites her to live with his family as his foster sister.

In 1962, Lehnsherr is tracking down Schmidt, while Xavier graduates from the [[University of Oxford]]. In [[Las Vegas]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer [[Moira MacTaggert]] follows U.S. Army Colonel Hendry into the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], where she sees Schmidt—now known as [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]—with mutant telepath [[Emma Frost]], cyclone-producing [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]], and [[teleportation|teleporter]] [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]]. Threatened by Shaw and teleported by Azazel to the [[Joint War Room]], Hendry advocates deployment of [[nuclear missile]]s in [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]]. Shaw, an energy-absorbing mutant whose powers have de-aged him, later kills Hendry.

MacTaggert, seeking Xavier's advice on mutation, takes him and Raven to the CIA, where they convince Director &lt;!-- He is only credited as McCone in the film --&gt;McCone that mutants exist and Shaw is a threat. Another CIA officer sponsors the mutants and invites them to the secret "Division X" facility. MacTaggert and Xavier find Shaw as Lehnsherr is attacking him on his yacht, and rescue Lehnsherr from drowning, while Shaw escapes in a submarine. Xavier brings Lehnsherr to Division X, where they meet young scientist [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], a mutant with [[prehensile feet]], who believes Raven's DNA may provide a "cure" for their appearance. Xavier uses McCoy's mutant-locating device [[Cerebro]] to seek recruits against Shaw. Xavier and Lehnsherr recruit stripper [[Angel Salvadore]], cabbie [[Darwin (comics)|Armando Muñoz]], Army prisoner [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]], and runaway [[Banshee (comics)|Sean Cassidy]].

When Frost meets with a Soviet general in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and uses her telepathic powers to pretend to have sex with him, Xavier and Lehnsherr capture Frost and discover that Shaw intends to start [[World War III]] that will trigger mutant ascendancy and the extinction of the human race. Azazel, Riptide and Shaw attack Division X, killing everyone but the mutants, whom Shaw invites to join him. Salvadore accepts; and when Summers and Muñoz retaliate, Shaw kills Muñoz. In Moscow, Shaw compels the general to have the USSR [[Cuban Missile Crisis|install missiles]] in [[Cuba]]. Wearing a helmet that blocks telepathy, Shaw follows the Soviet fleet in a submarine to ensure the missiles break a US blockade.

Raven, thinking McCoy is attracted to her in her natural form, tells him not to use the cure. When she later attempts to seduce Lehnsherr by taking the forms of various women, Lehnsherr tells her she is beautiful as she is, in her natural mutant form. McCoy uses the cure on himself but it backfires, giving him blue fur and leonine aspects. With McCoy piloting, the mutants and MacTaggert take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Lehnsherr uses his magnetic power to lift Shaw's submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Lehnsherr seizes Shaw's helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. Lehnsherr tells Shaw he shares Shaw's [[Chosen people|exclusivist]] view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, kills Shaw—over Xavier's objections—by forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaw's brain, causing massive pain to Xavier in the process.

Fearing the mutants, both fleets fire missiles at them, which Lehnsherr turns back in mid-flight. MacTaggert tries to stop Lehnsherr by shooting him but he deflects the bullets, one of which hits Xavier in the spine. Lehnsherr rushes to help Xavier and, distracted, allows the missiles to fall harmlessly into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Lehnsherr leaves with Salvadore, Azazel, Riptide and Mystique. Later, a wheelchair-bound Xavier and his mutants are at the mansion, where he intends to open a school. MacTaggert promises never to reveal his location and they kiss. When they kiss, Xavier uses his powers and erases their memories from her mind. Elsewhere, Lehnsherr, now wearing Shaw's helmet, frees Frost from confinement and he then goes by the name : “Magneto”.

:The telepathic mutant leader and founder of the [[X-Men]]. He is a close friend of Erik Lehnsherr until their differing views of mutantkind's place in humanity create a schism between them. McAvoy was Vaughn's top choice for Xavier, and, after being cast, auditioned with every actor considered for Magneto to test the duo's chemistry.&lt;ref name=geek/&gt; McAvoy said he did not read comic books as a child, but added that he was a fan of the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' cartoons]] from the age of 10. While he describes the older Charles Xavier as "a monk ... a selfless, egoless almost sexless force for the betterment of humanity and mortality", he says that the younger Xavier is a very different person: "It's quite fun because the complete opposite of that is an ego-fueled, sexed up self-serving dude.

==Production==

===Development===
During the production of ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] had discussed the idea of a film focusing on the young X-Men with the crew, which was met with approval; the concept was revived during the production of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.&lt;ref name=atom1/&gt; One of ''The Last Stand''{{'}}s writers, [[Zak Penn]], was hired to write and direct this spin-off,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Douglas, Edward | url = http://www.superherohype.com/features/90651-zak-penn-on-his-potential-x-men-spin-off | title = Zak Penn on His Potential X-Men Spin-off | publisher=SuperheroHype.com | date = April 11, 2006 | accessdate =December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this idea later fell through.&lt;ref name=erikdavis&gt;{{cite news | author=Davis, Erik | title = Zak Penn Talks X-Men Spin-Off, Incredible Hulk Casting | publisher="Cinematical" (column) [[Moviefone]] ([[AOL]]) | date = May 1, 2007 | url = http://blog.moviefone.com/2007/05/01/zak-penn-talks-x-men-spin-off-incredible-hulk-casting-with-cine/ | accessdate=February 9, 2008 | archivedate= June 4, 2012 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68B8WIM5f?url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2007/05/01/zak-penn-talks-x-men-spin-off-incredible-hulk-casting-with-cine/ | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn explained in 2007 that "the original idea was to have me do a young X-Men spin-off, a spin-off of the young X-Men characters. But someone came up with a pretty interesting idea [ ... ] it was this guy who worked with me named Mike Chamoy, he worked a lot with me on ''X3''. He came up with how to do a young X-Men movie which is not what you'd expect."&lt;ref name=erikdavis /&gt;

Around the same time, in December 2004, [[20th Century Fox]] hired screenwriter [[Sheldon Turner]] to draft a spin-off ''X-Men'' film, and he chose to write ''Magneto'', pitching it as "''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' meets ''X-Men''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming |author2=Claude Brodesser  | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117914863.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 | title=Fox pages Turner to pen Magneto spinoff pic | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=December 12, 2004 | accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Turner, the script he penned was set from 1939 to 1955,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michelle Kung | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1008429,00.html | title=Checking in with ...

As producer [[Simon Kinberg]] read the comic series ''[[X-Men: First Class (comics)|X-Men: First Class]]'', he suggested studio [[20th Century Fox]] to adapt it. Kinberg, however, did not want to follow the comic too much, as he felt "it was not fresh enough in terms of storytelling", considering them too similar to ''[[Twilight (novel)|Twilight]]'' and [[John Hughes (director)|John Hughes]] movies, and also because the producers wanted an adaptation that would introduce new characters.&lt;ref name=atom1&gt;{{cite video|title="''Children of the Atom: Filming ''X-Men First Class"|format=Featurette|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|location=''X-Men: First Class'' Blu-Ray|trans-title=Second Genesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kinberg and Shuler Donner said that they wanted characters with visuals and powers that had not been seen and that worked well as an ensemble, even if they did not work together in the comics.&lt;ref name=atom2/&gt; Shuler Donner later said that the original idea was to [[green-light]] ''First Class'' depending on the success of ''X-Men Origins: Magneto''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Spelling | first= Ian | url = http://blastr.com/2009/04/magneto-prequel-still-pos.php | title = Magneto prequel still possible, depending on Wolverine | publisher=[[Syfy|Sci Fi Wire / blastr]] | date = April 22, 2009 | accessdate =July 10, 2009 | archivedate = June 4, 2012 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/68BBoLa3A?url=http://blastr.com/2009/04/magneto-prequel-still-pos.php | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; That project was seeking approval to film in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Jeffrey Ressner | title = Klieg Lights, Big City | publisher = [[The Politico]] | date = June 4, 2008 | url = http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0608/10807.html | accessdate = June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by December 2008, Goyer said filming would begin if ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' was successful.

Shuler Donner suggested the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] as the villains.&lt;ref name=atom1/&gt;

In addition to Moss, [[Ashley Edward Miller]] and [[Zack Stentz]] were hired to rewrite the script. Miller compared it tonally to Singer's work on the first two ''X-Men'' films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Pirrello, Phil | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/06/inside-x-men-first-class| title = Inside X-Men: First Class | publisher=[[IGN]] | date = May 6, 2010 | accessdate =December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair centered the film on Xavier and Magneto's relationship, and wrote the other characters and storylines in terms of "how they fit in the tension between Erik and Charles".&lt;ref name=atom1/&gt; Singer dropped out of the director's position in March 2010 due to his commitment to a ''[[Jack the Giant Slayer|Jack the Giant Killer]]'' adaptation.

The producers listed various possible directors, but at first did not consider [[Matthew Vaughn]] because he started working on ''The Last Stand'' before backing out. After seeing Vaughn's satirical superhero film ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'' (2010), Kinberg decided to contact Vaughn to see if he would be interested in ''First Class''.&lt;ref name=atom1/&gt; When Fox offered Vaughn the "chance to reboot X-Men and put your stamp all over it", he first thought the studio was joking, but accepted after discovering that it was to be set in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=hype&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Edward|title=Exclusive Interview with X-Men: First Class Director Matthew Vaughn|url=http://www.superherohype.com/features/167401-exclusive-interview-with-x-men-first-class-director-matthew-vaughn|publisher=Superhero Hype|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director stated that ''First Class'' would become the opportunity to combine many of his dream projects: "I [[Have one's cake and eat it too|got my cake and ate it]], managed to do an ''X-Men'' movie, and a [[James Bond|Bond]] thing, and a [[John Frankenheimer|Frankenheimer]] political thriller at the same time".&lt;ref name=geek/&gt; Vaughn signed on as Singer's replacement in May 2010, and Fox subsequently announced a June 3, 2011 release date.&lt;ref name=prequel&gt;{{cite news | author=McClintock, Pamela | url = https://variety.com/2010/film/news/x-men-prequel-to-open-june-3-2011-1118018752/2 | title = 'X-Men' prequel to open June 04, 2011|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = May 5, 2010 | accessdate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughn also rewrote the script with his screenwriting partner [[Jane Goldman]], adding new characters and changing existing character arcs and dynamics—for instance, the idea of a love triangle between Xavier, Magneto and Moira MacTaggert was cut.&lt;ref name=atom1/&gt; The character of [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] was also cut, as the director felt that "we didn't have enough time or money" to make the character work. Vaughn and Goldman considered including mentions to the [[Civil Rights Movement]], but ultimately the director felt that "I had enough political subplot in this movie". Vaughn stated that his biggest concern was to both make Erik and Charles' friendship believable given the short timespan of the film, and on how the character of Magneto was built - "Shaw was the villain, but now you're seeing all those elements of Shaw going into Magneto."&lt;ref name=geek/&gt; An action scene that was to have been set in a dream sequence with revolving rooms was scrapped after the release of ''[[Inception]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/inception-wakeup-call-xmen-first-class-forced-to-jettison-dream-scenes/|title='Inception' wake-up call – 'X-Men: First Class' director jettisons similar dream-time scenes |date=September 2, 2010|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=September 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing his thought process towards the material, Vaughn said he was motivated by "unfinished business" with Marvel, having been previously involved with the production of both ''X-Men: The Last Stand''&lt;ref name=hype/&gt; and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.&lt;ref name=slashfilm/&gt; Vaughn declared that he was more enthusiastic about ''First Class'' than ''The Last Stand'' due to not being constrained by the previous installments, and having the opportunity to "start fresh", while "nodding towards" the successful elements from those films.&lt;ref name=slashfilm/&gt; Vaughn compared ''First Class'' to both ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), which restarted a franchise with an unseen approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Tilly| first = Chris | title= X-Men: First Class Set Visit | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/09/x-men-first-class-set-visit|publisher=IGN|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film, which paid homage to the original source material while taking it in a new direction with a fresh, young cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = White | first = Cindy | title = X-Men Following Star Trek's Lead | publisher=[[IGN]] | date = August 2, 2010 | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/08/02/x-men-following-star-treks-lead | accessdate = August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding continuity, Vaughn said his intention was "to make as good a film that could stand on its own two feet regardless of all the other films" and also that could "[[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] and start a whole new X-Men franchise".&lt;ref name=slashfilm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/film-interview-xmen-class-director-matthew-vaughn/|title=/Film Interview: 'X-Men: First Class' Director Matthew Vaughn|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=May 25, 2011|first=Germain|last=Lussier|accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman added the film was kind of an "[[alternate history]]" for the X-Men, saying that while rebooting, the writers did not want to go fully "against the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] of the ''X-Men'' trilogy", comparing to the various approaches the comic had in over fifty years of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1283|title=X-Men: First Class Interviews|first=Helen|last=O'Hara|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=December 25, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614124620/http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1283|archivedate=June 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also rescues a central concept in the comics, the fact that radiation is one of the causes of genetic mutation in the ''X-Men'' fictional universe, and incorporates it in the storyline, resurrecting the concept which went unused in the last years, as writers in the comics more recently have attributed the phenomenon of mutation mostly to evolution and natural selection.

[[File:X-MEN First Class.JPG|thumb|left|Filming of the naval battle scenes.|alt=A battleship fires its guns while surrounded by helicopters and a crane.]]
The 1960s setting of ''X-Men: First Class'', technologically inspired by the [[James Bond (film series)|''James Bond'' films]] of that era, also added to the international feel of the characters.&lt;ref name="Harry"&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Harry Knowles | last = Knowles | first = Harry | url = http://aintitcool.com/node/46217 | title = So Bryan Singer just called regarding Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class ... I'm quite excited now | publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]] | date = August 20, 2010 | accessdate =December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinberg said the series was a major influence for the way they "did a cool job representing the period, in a way it still felt muscular and action-oriented", and Vaughn added that Magneto was his attempt to recreate [[Sean Connery]]'s [[James Bond (character)|Bond]] in both style and the "badass, charming, ruthless and sweet" personality.&lt;ref name=atom5&gt;{{cite video|title="''Children of the Atom: Filming ''X-Men First Class"|format=Featurette|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|location=''X-Men: First Class'' Blu-Ray|trans-title=New Frontier: A Dose of Style}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director said his goal was to "feel like a '60s Bond film, but with a little bit of reality it could be grounded in. I wanted there to be just a hint of this world of the mutants coming through. A mutant in this world having powers needed to be the equivalent of you or I sneezing, as normal as possible, at least until the humans start seeing it for the first time."&lt;ref name=hitfix/&gt; At the same time, Vaughn tried to do the "bloody hard balancing" of modern and antique to recreate the 1960s in way it was "not so alien to the kids that it looked like a [[period piece]]."&lt;ref name=atom5/&gt; The director also tried to depict the era still in a realistic way, particularly "that 60s [[Misogyny|misogynist]] vibe" with women in skimpy suits, and McTaggert's reliability as a CIA agent being questioned.&lt;ref name=geek/&gt;

Vaughn said he shot the film in a way which resembled the productions of the 1960s, with "very traditional framing, and camera movement when it needs to move, not just throwing it around and whizz-bang",&lt;ref name=geek/&gt; and using the [[anamorphic]] format "to create a widescreen experience, which is emblematic of '60s movies, such as the ''James Bond'' films".&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; The director had to hire five [[cinematographer]]s - with sole credit being given to [[John Mathieson (cinematographer)|John Mathieson]], who came halfway through the shoot and did "forty-five percent, fifty-five percent" of the film - and four [[assistant director]]s to successfully convey the look he wanted for the film.&lt;ref name=geek/&gt;&lt;ref name=hitfix/&gt; Visual effects supervisor Matt Johnson added that for the lighting of the digital interior of Cerebro, "keeping with the '60s vibe, we put in some old school elements such as [[lens flare]] and [[chromatic aberration]] and [[Purple fringing|edge fringing]]."&lt;ref name=cinefex&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.digital.cinefex.com/nxtbooks/cinefex/126/#/96|title=First Class Effects|first=Jody|last=Duncan|journal=Cinefex|issue=126|date=July 2011|pages=96–120|accessdate=June 5, 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetics of the decade were also invoked by designers Simon Clowes and Kyle Cooper of Prologue Films, who were responsible for the end credits and tried to do something that "could be done with traditional optical". The credits animation depicts DNA strands through simple geometric shapes, drawing inspiration from both [[Saul Bass]] and [[Maurice Binder]]'s work in the ''Bond'' films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Retro Cool|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|location=''X-Men: First Class'' DVD|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin story made the X-Men costumes resemble the ones in the original comics, while still being functional, with the yellow parts resembling [[Kevlar]] and the blue looking like [[ballistic nylon]], and resembling 1962 apparel in both the fabrics and the "[[Space Age]] fashion". The costumes tried to convey the character personalities—for instance, Xavier wore loose clothes, and Emma Frost's costumes were white and shimmery. Magneto's costume at the film's ending also closely resembled the original version from the comics, and three versions of his helmet were made, two to fit Fassbender's head and one for Bacon's.&lt;ref name=atom4&gt;{{cite video|title="''Children of the Atom: Filming ''X-Men First Class"|format=Featurette|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|location=''X-Men: First Class'' Blu-Ray|trans-title=Suiting Up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
''First Class'' employed 1,150 [[visual effects]] shots,&lt;ref name=awn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/vfxworld/going-deeper-x-mens-origins|title=Going Deeper into X-Men's Origins|date=June 11, 2011 |first=Bill|last=Desowitz|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=October 29, 2011 | page=[http://www.awn.com/articles/going-deeper-x-mens-origins/page/2%2C1 2] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Awfebgd?url=http://www.awn.com/articles/going-deeper-x-mens-origins | archivedate= June 4, 2012 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was done by six companies:&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; [[Rhythm &amp; Hues]] was responsible for Emma Frost, Mystique and Angel, as well as set extensions; [[Cinesite]] handled Azazel, the visuals for Cerebro and environment effects; [[Luma Pictures]] did Banshee, Havok and Darwin; [[Moving Picture Company]] did Beast, Riptide, and the scene where Shaw's yacht is destroyed and he escapes in a submarine; [[Digital Domain]] created Sebastian Shaw's powers, and [[Weta Digital]] was responsible for the climactic battle in Cuba.&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; The overall coordination was provided by visual effects designer [[John Dykstra]], who said the biggest difficulty was the tight schedule: "It was slightly less than a year and I've never done anything like that before (''[[Spider-Man (film series)|Spider-Man]]'' was frequently two years)."&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; British company 4dMax employed special [[3D scanner]]s to digitize data of the sets and actors which would be used by the effects companies.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; This allowed for computer-generated sets such as the mirrored nuclear reactor where Magneto battles Shaw&lt;ref name=awn/&gt;—for which the effects team used the mirror maze fight in ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' as a reference—and the domed walls of Cerebro. Digital models of Washington and Moscow were also created based on photographs of the actual cities,&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; with the Russian one in particular having vehicles and military hardware based on videos of a 1962 [[Red Square]], and a digital army doing an actual Soviet-style [[military step|march]]. With the exception of scenes featuring the actors on ships (shot on a small [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] set) and the X-Jet (done on a set replicating the front two-thirds of the aircraft, which was mounted atop a roller wheel so it could be spun) the naval battle was entirely digital, featuring a simulated ocean and high resolution 3D models of the X-Jet, Shaw's submarine and 16 warships. The designs were mostly based on real vehicles, with the jet being a modified [[SR-71 Blackbird]], the submarine a combination of various models from the 1940s and 1950s, and replicas of the actual US and USSR fleets in the 1960s — though a few were not in service in 1962. A particular Soviet cruiser was a larger version of the ''[[Kresta I class cruiser|Kresta I]]'' and ''[[Kresta II class cruiser|II]]'', leading Weta to dub it the ''Kresta III''.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; [[Practical effects]] were still used whenever possible, such as having on location most of the objects young Erik throws after his mother's death, actors and stuntmen dangled from wires, and real explosions and light effects as reference for Havok's beams.&lt;ref name=ext/&gt;

While in the comics Shaw's absorption power was depicted by having him grow up to ten times his original size, ''First Class'' instead does what company [[Digital Domain]] called a "kinetic echo", where a digital Kevin Bacon would be rippled, deformed and at times multiplied in repeated "iterations" that appear in a short period, to "see [Shaw] displace and deform in a kinetic and organic way".&lt;ref name=ext/&gt; According to Dykstra, the biggest problem with Frost's diamond body was depicting it "without looking like she was made of [[Jell-o]] or the [[Polygon mesh|polygon model]] of a human being".&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; The morphed Frost, which the visual effects tried to make look more like a faceted crystal than glass,&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; was [[rotoscoping|rotomated]] into Jones in the live-action plates, while still retaining the actress' eyes and lips.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; As the character kept on going in and out of her diamond form, a [[motion capture]] tracking suit could not be employed, so instead the effects team used both gray and chrome balls and a jumpsuit covered in mirrors—which also served as a lighting reference.&lt;ref name=ext/&gt;&lt;ref name=fxguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/making-mutants-for-x-men-first-class/|title=Making Mutants for ''X-Men: First Class'' | first = Ian | last = Failes|date=June 16, 2011 | accessdate=October 29, 2011 | publisher=[[fxguide]].com | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/63YscEzx6?url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/making-mutants-for-x-men-first-class/ |archivedate=November 29, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Angel's digital wings, the animators studied slow-motion footage of dragonflies to create the wing pattern in a realistic way,&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; and the designers added [[iridescence]] to "make the wings prettier".&lt;ref name=atom6&gt;{{cite video|title="''Children of the Atom: Filming ''X-Men First Class"|format=Featurette|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|location=''X-Men: First Class'' Blu-Ray|trans-title=Pulling Off the Impossible}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual of Banshee's screams was done through a digital ring-like structure based on renderings of sound waves such as [[Schlieren photography]].&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt;&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; The visual for Havok's blasts employed similar rings,&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; concentrated in beams or rings of light which were then [[Match moving|match moved]] into Till's mimed throwing.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; For Banshee's flight, the visual effects team used digital doubles only for distant shots, with closer ones employing Jones shot in a special flight rig.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; Azazel's teleporting was made to resemble the "inky smoky effects" used with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], who appeared in ''X2'' and is Azazel's son in the comics.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; However, while Nightcrawler only left a smoke trail, the visual effects team had Azazel accompanied by digital fire and smoke "because he was more closely aligned with the devil". The fire was also used "as a mask to hide or reveal the body", according to effects supervisor Matt Johnson.&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; Since the visible part of whirlwinds are the dust and dirt sucked up by them, the ones Riptide produces were made to resemble "a tornado of gas, made out of nothingness" by visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi. The final product was mostly a practical effect made with [[dry ice]], which was augmented by [[computer-generated imagery]].&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; The visual effects team portrayed Mystique's abilities slightly differently due to this being a younger version, with "the scales being slightly longer and the transformation being slightly showier than when she became the more mature Rebecca."&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; For Beast, computer graphics depicted his simian-like feet, the transformation sequence, and a few facial replacements for when Beast opened his mouth wider than the mask on Hoult's face allowed.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt;

==Music==
[[Henry Jackman]], who had worked with Vaughn in ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'', composed the score. Following the ''James Bond'' influences on ''First Class'', Jackman drew inspiration from [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry's]] work in the said series, which he described as "extremely posh pop music".&lt;ref name=atom7&gt;{{cite video|title="''Children of the Atom: Filming'' X-Men: First Class"|format=Featurette|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|location=''X-Men: First Class'' Blu-Ray|trans-title=Sound and Fury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackman started his work with a "''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''-style theme", which is only featured in the final parts of the film as Vaughn thought it was too "successful and triumphant" for a disjointed and up-and-coming team. Therefore, Vaughn reworked a 'stretched' [[Half time (music)|half time]] version of the theme into the remainder of the film. The themes for Magneto and Shaw have similarities to reflect their "perverted father-son" relationship, with even a seamless transition during the scene where Shaw is killed to represent Lensherr's full transformation into Magneto.&lt;ref name=fmmg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=8019|title=Audio: On The Score With Henry Jackman|first=Daniel|last=Schweiger|date=June 6, 2011|publisher=Film Music Magazine|accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track 'Rage and Serenity' is reused in Vaughn's 2017 film ''[[Kingsman: The Golden Circle]]''.

In a roundtable interview with multiple news outlets, Vaughn responded to a question about choosing "[[Love Love (Take That song)|Love Love]]" by the British band [[Take That]] for the end-credits theme, explaining, "I bumped into [the band's lead singer] [[Gary Barlow|Gary &lt;nowiki&gt;[Barlow]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] in [Los Angeles], and we were just talking, and I said, 'Do you want to come and see a rough cut of it?' And they came, and they wrote the song, and I listened to it, and I said, 'I think it'll be a hit', and if we can do a video which gets girls more interested ... we might get them to come and watch it. So it's pure commerce, to be blunt, and I want women to see this film."&lt;ref name=geek&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/james-bond/17507/matthew-vaughn-interview-x-men-first-class-thor-hollywood-james-bond-take-that-and-more |title=Matthew Vaughn interview: X-Men: First Class, Thor, Hollywood, James Bond, Take That and more | date=May 25, 2011 |first= Michael| last= Leader|publisher=Den of Geek ([[Dennis Publishing]])|location= [[UK]] | accessdate=June 10, 2012 | archivedate=July 1, 2012| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68q12ykNM?url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/james-bond/17507/matthew-vaughn-interview-x-men-first-class-thor-hollywood-james-bond-take-that-and-more | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- If anyone has copies of the US and the UK DVD releases to check if the song actually appears in one version or the other, please add that information here --&gt; An instrumental of the song "[[Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)]]" by [[Gnarls Barkley]] is used in the 'mutant recruitment' scene.

The site's critical consensus reads, "With a strong script, stylish direction, and powerful performances from its well-rounded cast, ''X-Men: First Class'' is a welcome return to form for the franchise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/x_men_first_class/ | title=X-Men: First Class (2011) | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] ([[Flixster]]) | accessdate = December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film received a score of 65 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/x-men-first-class/critic-reviews | title=X-Men: First Class | publisher= [[Metacritic]] ([[CBS Interactive]]) | accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the major trade publications, Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described the film as "audacious, confident and fueled by youthful energy", and said that "director Vaughn impressively maintains a strong focus dedicated to clarity and dramatic power ... and orchestrates the mayhem with a laudable coherence, a task made easier by a charging, churning score by Henry Jackman ...

This is not a kids' movie."&lt;ref name="Film Journal International"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/reviews/major-releases/e3ie161d52b7c6dfd0feaabf7fdce60fc03 | title=Film Review:'' X-Men: First Class'' | work=[[Film Journal International]] | date=June 2, 2011 | accessdate=June 5, 2012 | authorlink = Frank Lovece | author = Lovece, Frank }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In consumer publications, [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised "the kind of youthful, Brit-knockabout pop energy director Matthew Vaughn absorbed from his previous collaborations as producer of director [[Guy Ritchie]]'s bloke-y larks", and found McAvoy and Fassbender "a casting triumph. These two have, yes, real star magnetism, both individually and together: They're both cool and intense, suave and unaffected, playful and dead serious about their grand comic-book work."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lisa Schwarzbaum|Schwarzbaumm, Lisa]].
