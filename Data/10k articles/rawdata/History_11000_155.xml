'''Angelos Delivorrias''' ({{lang-el|Άγγελος Δεληβορριάς}}; 16 August 1937&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scuoladiatene.it/archivio-in-evidenza/in-memoriam-angelos-delivorrias.html ]{{dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 24 April 2018) was a [[Greece|Greek]] archeologist who was the director of [[Benaki Museum]] for 41 years and a member of the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.protothema.gr/culture/article/781570/alert-efuge-apo-ti-zoi-o-aggelos-delivorias-proin-dieuthudis-tou-mouseiou-benaki/ Έφυγε από τη ζωή ο Άγγελος Δεληβορριάς στα 81 του] {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Graduate in the Faculty of Philosophy of the [[University of Thessaloniki]], Angelos Delivorrias graduated from the [[University of Freiburg]] in Germany in 1956. In 1965 he was appointed to the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] and served at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]]. In 1973, he graduated from the [[University of Sorbonne]] at the [[École pratique des hautes études]]. A year later he was assigned the direction of the Benaki Museum in Athens, where he recommended immediately a radical regeneration that was completed after 27 years. In 1992 he was professor of Art History at the Department of Theater Studies of the School of Philosophy of the [[University of Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatre.uoa.gr/didaktiko-dynamiko/omotimoi-ka8hghtes/aggelos-delhborrias.html Άγγελος Δεληβορριάς Ομότιμος καθηγητής, Διευθυντής Μουσείου Μπενάκη] {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he was honored by the Academy of Athens with its Silver Medal, while the Benaki Museum was awarded the "Gold Medal". On 31 October 2014, at an event held in the main building of the Museum, he announced his departure from the post of director, now occupying a seat in the Administrative Committee of the Foundation. In June 2016 he was elected as full member of the Academy of Athens, in the archeology-museology department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tovima.gr/culture/article/?aid=806645 Ο Αγγελος Δεληβοριάς τακτικό μέλος της Ακαδημίας Αθηνών.

== Director of Benaki Museum ==
Delivorrias managed to attract the interest of many donors and he realized a narrative process of development, consisting in the prominence of Greek civilization from antiquity to contemporary art. According to himself, he was the longest-lasting internationally head of the Museum, but at the same time the manager, the fundraiser and the scientific officer, as well as the man who had undertaken all sorts of contacts with the administrative services of the Greek state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/europe/benaki-museum-director-struggles-with-budget-cuts.html Benaki Museum Director Struggles With Budget Cuts]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anneliese Maier''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmaɪɐ|lang}}; November 17, 1905 in [[Tübingen]], [[German Empire|Germany]] – December, 1971 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]) was a German [[History of science|historian of science]].

== Biography ==
Anneliese Maier was the daughter of the philosopher Heinrich Maier (1876–1933). She studied [[natural sciences]] and [[philosophy]] from 1923 to 1926 at the universities in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Zurich|Zurich]]. In 1930 she finished her dissertation on [[Immanuel Kant]] (''Kants Qualitätskategorien''). She then worked for the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1936 she moved to [[Rome]]. There she worked until 1945 at the [[Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana]] on the [[philosophy of nature]].
  
In 1951 Maier became an honorary professor.  She became a member of the Academies of Sciences in (1949), Göttingen (1962) and Munich (1966). In 1966 she received the [[George Sarton Medal]] for her profound studies on the history of natural philosophy in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] has named a research grant after her, the Anneliese Maier Research Award, which is a "collaboration award to promote the internationalisation of the humanities and social sciences in Germany."&lt;ref&gt;"Anneliese Maier Research Award" ''Humboldt Foundation''. https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/anneliese-maier-award.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1457">'''Anticlides of Athens''' (or '''Anticleides''') lived after the time of Alexander the Great,&lt;ref&gt;Plut. Alex. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently referred to by later writers. At least four works may be attributed to him; whether these works were all written by Anticlides of Athens cannot be decided with certainty. None survive, except in scanty quotations:

1. ''Peri [[Nostos|Noston]]'' was an account of the return of the Greeks from their ancient expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;Athen. iv. p.&amp;nbsp;157, f., ix. p.&amp;nbsp;384, d., xi. p.&amp;nbsp;466, c.&lt;/ref&gt; Anticlides' statement about the [[Pelasgians]], which Strabo&lt;ref&gt;Strabo v. p.&amp;nbsp;221&lt;/ref&gt; quotes, is probably taken from the work on the ''Nostoi''.

2. ''Deliaca'', about [[Delos]]&lt;ref&gt;Schol. ''ad Apoll. Rhod.'' 1. 1207, 1289.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. ''Exegeticus'' appears to have been a sort of Dictionary, in which perhaps an explanation of those words and phrases was given which occurred in the ancient stories.&lt;ref&gt;Athen. xi. p.&amp;nbsp;473, b. c.&lt;/ref&gt;

4. ''On Alexander'', of which the second book is quoted by [[Diogenes Laertius]]. &lt;ref&gt; Diogenes Laertius viii. 11; comp. Plut. Alex. l c.&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Berestye Archeological Museum''' is unique in Europe, because its visitors can view an [[archaeological site]] displaying an authentic East Slavic wooden town dating back to the 13th century. The 1800 sq.m site was excavated by archeologists of the [[Belarusian Academy of Sciences]] in 1968 – 1981 in [[Brest, Belarus]]. The project was supervised by Dr. [[Pyotr Fyodorovich Lysenko|P.F.Lysenko]]. In 1982, a modern structure of concrete, glass and aluminum in the shape of a huge pitched roof was erected over the archeological site. The museum was opened on March 2, 1982. The museum displays preserved 28 [[log cabin]]s, as well over 1400 artifacts dating back to 10th and 14th centuries which were unearthed during  the [[archaeological excavation|excavation]].

'''Bolokhov''' ({{lang-ro|Bolechov}}; {{lang-ru|Болохов}}) was a [[city]] mentioned in the ''[[Kievan Chronicle|Kievan]]'' and ''[[Galician–Volhynian Chronicle|Galician–Volhynian]]'' [[chronicle]]s, which gave the name to the [[Bolokhovian Land]], but that has not yet been found or identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LgZ4BAAAQBAJ|title=Болоховская земля и ее значение в русской истории.

==Chronic mentions==
According to [[historian]]s, Bolokhov was located in the upper reaches of the [[Southern Bug]], in the basins of the [[Horyn River]] with the [[Sluch River (Ukraine)|Sluch]] [[tributary]] and the [[Teteriv River]]. This follows the mention of it in the ''Galician-Volhynian Chronicle'' of the [[XIII century]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://history.org.ua/LiberUA/ehu/1.pdf|title=Encyclopedia of the History of Ukraine|first=Kotlyar N.|last=Fedorovich|publisher=[[NASU Institute of History of Ukraine]]|volume=1|language=uk|year=2003|isbn=9660007345|pp=688|editor=Valeriy Smoliy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first mention is associated with the year 1150, when [[Volodymyrko Volodarovych]], [[prince of Galicia]], went from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] to [[Kiev]] through Bolokhov. The second reference dates back to 1170, when [[Mstislav II of Kiev|Mstislav II]], through Bolokhov, fled from Kiev to [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]]. The third reference is in 1231, the fourth, about the attack of [[Daniel of Galicia]], in 1241, and finally the last in 1257.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/ЭСБЕ/Болоховская_земля|title=Болоховская земля|first=Vasily E.|last=Rudakov|publisher=''Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary''|location=[[Saint Petersburg]]|volume=4|pp=319-320|year=1891|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Bolokhov is also mentioned in the ''Kievan Chronicle''. It tells about the 1150 war for the throne of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] between [[Iziaslav II of Kiev]] and his uncle [[Yuri Dolgorukiy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Caryl Churchill''' (born 3 September 1938, [[London]]) is a British playwright known for dramatising the abuses of power, for her use of non-[[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] techniques, and for her exploration of sexual politics and [[feminist]] themes.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/117251/Caryl-Churchill Caryl Churchill profile], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''; accessed 26 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
Her early work developed [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[Modernism|modernist]] dramatic and theatrical techniques of [[Epic theatre]] to explore issues of [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. From ''[[A Mouthful of Birds]]'' (1986) onwards, she began to [[Experimental theatre|experiment]] with forms of [[Dance Theatre|dance-theatre]], incorporating techniques developed from the [[Performance art|performance]] tradition initiated by [[Antonin Artaud]] with his '[[Theatre of Cruelty]]'. This move away from a clear ''[[Fabel]]'' dramaturgy towards increasingly fragmented and [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] narratives characterises her work as [[Postmodern theater|postmodernist]].

==Background==
Churchill was born in London, England, the daughter of Jan Brown, a fashion model, and Robert Churchill, a political cartoonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/35/Caryl-Churchill.html|title=Caryl Churchill Biography (1938-)|website=Filmreference.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], her family emigrated to [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada; Churchill was ten years old. In Montreal, she attended [[Trafalgar School for Girls]].

She returned to England to attend university, and in 1960 she graduated from [[Lady Margaret Hall]], a women's college at [[Oxford University]], with a B.A. degree in [[English Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/Alumni/Prominent-alumni.aspx | title=LMH, Oxford – Prominent Alumni|website=Lmh.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also began her writing career there. Her four earliest plays, ''Downstairs'' (produced 1958),''You've No Need to be Frightened'', ''Having a Wonderful Time'' (1960), and  ''Easy Death'' (produced 1962) were performed at Oxford by student theatre ensembles.&lt;ref name="doollee.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsC/churchill-caryl.html|title=The playwrights database of modern plays|website=Doollee.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 she married David Harter, a barrister.&lt;ref name="The New York Times - 5 December 2004 - The Mysteries of Caryl Churchill"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/theater/newsandfeatures/the-mysteries-of-caryl-churchill.html|title=The Mysteries of Caryl Churchill|last=[[Sarah Lyall]]|date=December 5, 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three sons and live in [[Islington]], North London.

==Career==
It was while raising a family in the 1960s and '70s that Churchill began to write short radio dramas for [[BBC]] radio. These included ''The Ants'' (1962), ''Not, Not, Not, Not Enough Oxygen'' (1971), and ''Schreber's Nervous Illness'' (1972). She also wrote television plays for the BBC, including ''The After Dinner Joke'' (1978) and ''Crimes'' (1982). These, as well as some of her [[radio plays]], have been adapted for the stage.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

===Themes and plays===
{{moresources|section|date=January 2018}}
In 1972, she wrote ''[[Owners (Play)|Owners]]'', a two-act, 14-scene play about obsession with power. It was her first stage play and "her first major theatrical endeavour"; it was produced in London the same year.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; Churchill's socialist views are expressed in the play, a critique of the values that most capitalists take for granted: being aggressive, getting ahead, doing well.{{says who|date=May 2017}}

She served as resident dramatist at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] from 1974 to 1975, and later began collaboration with theatre companies such as [[Joint Stock Theatre Company]] and [[Monstrous Regiment Theatre Company|Monstrous Regiment]] (a feminist theatre collective). Both used an extended workshop period in their development of new plays. Churchill continues to use an [[improvisation]]al workshop period in developing a number of her plays. During this period, she also wrote ''Objections to Sex and Violence'' (1974).&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Her first play to receive wide notice was ''[[Cloud Nine (play)|Cloud Nine]]'' (1979), "a farce about sexual politics", set partly in a British overseas colony during the [[Victorian era]]. It explores the effects of the [[colonialist]]/[[imperialist]] mindset on intimate personal relationships, and uses cross-gender casting for comic and instructive effect. The play became successful in Britain and in the United States, winning an [[Obie Award]] in 1982 for best play of the year in New York.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Churchill gradually abandoned more conventions of [[Realism (theatre)|realism]], and her loyalty to feminist themes and ideas became a guiding principle in her work. She won an [[Obie Award]] for best play with ''[[Top Girls]]'' (1982), "which deals with women's losing their humanity in order to attain power in a male-dominated environment."&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; It features an all-female cast, and focuses on Marlene, who has relinquished a home and family to achieve success in the world of business. Half the action takes place at a celebratory dinner where Marlene mixes with historical, iconic and fictional women who have achieved great stature in a "man's world", but always at great cost. The other half of the play, set a year in the past, focuses on Marlene's family, where the true cost of her "successful" life becomes poignantly and frighteningly apparent.

''Softcops'' (first produced by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1984), is a "surreal play set in 19th-century France about government attempts to depoliticize illegal acts."&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

''[[Serious Money]]'' (1987), "a comedy about excesses in the financial world",&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; is a verse play, chiefly written in rhyming couplets. It takes a [[satire|satirical]] look at the vagaries of the [[stock market]] and its Thatcherite denizens. The play was highly acclaimed, perhaps in part because it played immediately after the [[stock market crash]] of 1987.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; ''[[Icecream]]'' ([[Royal Court Theatre]] 1989) explores Anglo-American stereotypes.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

In ''[[The Skriker]]'' (1994), Churchill's play, a visionary exploration of global ecology made through gender games, storytelling, distorted language and evocations of modern urban life, follows an ancient and shape-shifting death portent (''The Skriker'') in her search for love, revenge and human understanding.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

"The prolific Churchill continued to push boundaries into the late 1990s. In 1997 she collaborated with the composer Orlando Gough to create 'Hotel,' a choreographed opera or sung ballet set in a hotel room. Also that year her surrealistic short play 'This Is a Chair' was produced."&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Her 2002 play, ''[[A Number]]'', addresses the subject of [[human cloning]] and questions of identity. Her adapted screenplay of ''[[A Number]]'' was shown on BBC TV in September 2008. Her recent play, ''Drunk Enough To Say I Love You'' (2006), takes a critical look at what she sees as Britain's submission to the United States in foreign policy.

In 2010, Churchill was commissioned to write the [[libretto]] for a new short opera by [[Orlando Gough]], as part of the [[Royal Opera House]]'s ROH2 OperaShots initiative.  The resulting work, ''A ring a lamp a thing'', played for five performances in the Linbury Studio Theatre at the Royal Opera House.&lt;ref&gt;O'Mahony, John. [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/10/ingerland-operashots-gough-pook-sawhney "Operas about wags? Why not, says the Royal Opera House"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ''[[Love and Information]]'', opened at the Royal Court Theatre in September 2012, directed by [[James Macdonald (director)|James Macdonald]]. It gained great critical and popular acclaim.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The play, featuring 100 characters and performed by a cast of 15, is structured as a series of more than 50 fragmented scenes, some no longer than 25 seconds, all of which are apparently unrelated but which accumulate into a startling mosaic, a portrayal of modern consciousness and the need for human intimacy, love and connection. The play will have its regional premiere at Sheffield Theatres in June 2018, directed by Caroline Steinbeis.

===Translations===
Churchill has published a translation of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca's]] ''[[Thyestes]]'' and her version of [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[A Dream Play]]''. The latter was premiered at the National Theatre in 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Retrospective===
The [[Royal Court Theatre]] held a 70th Birthday retrospective of her work by presenting readings of many of her most famous plays directed by notable playwrights, including [[Martin Crimp]] and [[Mark Ravenhill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whatson01.asp?play=528] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course it's possible to trace recurring themes in Churchill's work – alienation between parent and child, the possibility and failure of revolution. But it is the variety of her work that is most striking. As Von Mayenburg says: "With each play, she discovers new genres and forms. She then discards them and moves on, opening up possibilities for other playwrights to explore. I think many people writing today don't even realise they've been influenced by her. She's changed the language of theatre. And very few playwrights do that."&lt;ref name="ravenhill"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/03/carylchurchill.theatre|title='She made us raise our game'|author=[[Mark Ravenhill]]|date=3 September 2008|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Interest in Palestine===
{{Main article|Seven Jewish Children}}
Churchill is a patron of the [[Palestine Solidarity Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestinecampaign.org/Index5b.asp?m_id=1&amp;l1_id=2&amp;l2_id=12|title=Patrons|work=Palestine Solidarity Campaign|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302091920/http://www.palestinecampaign.org/Index5b.asp?m_id=1&amp;l1_id=2&amp;l2_id=12|archivedate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2009, she wrote a ten-minute play that explores a history of Israel, ending with the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict|2008 Israeli attack on Gaza]]. It was performed for free at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], with a collection taken to donate to [[Medical Aid for Palestinians]].&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt;

''[[The Sunday Times]]'' condemned its "ludicrous and utterly predictable lack of even-handedness"; but for ''[[The Times]]'', "there are no heroes or villains, for all that Churchill decries what is happening in Gaza".&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Writers such as Jeffrey Goldberg of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' and Melanie Phillips in her ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' blog criticised the play as anti-Semitic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/03/ari_roth.php#more|title=Caryl Churchill: Gaza&amp;apos;s Shakespeare, or Fetid Jew-Baiter?|first=Jeffrey|last=Goldberg|website=Jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/3334851/the-royal-courts-mystery-play.thtml# |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414230800/http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/3334851/the-royal-courts-mystery-play.thtml# |archive-date=14 April 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as did John Nathan.&lt;ref name=Nathan/&gt; He noted that
Churchill has said that ''[[Seven Jewish Children]]'' is "not just a theatre event but a political event."&lt;ref name=Nathan&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: Seven Jewish Children|publisher=''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]''|first= John|last=Nathan|date=12 February 2009 |url=http://www.thejc.com/articles/review-seven-jewish-children}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that a play representing views of one community and critical of that community needed to be written by a member of that community.&lt;ref name=Nathan/&gt; The Royal Court denied the accusation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/feb/18/caryl-churchill-gaza-play|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|title=Churchill's Gaza play accused of antisemitism|first=Charlotte|last=Higgins|date=18 February 2009|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/letters/letters-jacobson-on-gaza-1628191.html|work=The Independent|location=London|title=Letters: Jacobson on Gaza|date=21 February 2009|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill published the play, ''[[Seven Jewish Children]] – a play about Gaza'', online, for free download and use. Churchill said: "Anyone can perform it without acquiring the rights, as long as they do a collection for people in Gaza at the end of it".&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jan/24/theatre-gaza-caryl-churchill-royal-court-seven-jewish-children Royal Court acts fast with Gaza crisis play], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2009/apr/25/seven-jewish-children-caryl-churchill|title=Video: Seven Jewish Children|first1=Caryl|last1=Churchill|first2=Jennie|last2=Stoller|first3=Elliot|last3=Smith|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=27 January 2018|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chen Boda''' ({{zh|s=陈伯达 |w='''Ch'en Po-ta'''}}; 1904–1989), was a secretary to [[Mao Zedong]] and a prominent member of the radical leadership during the [[Cultural Revolution]], chairing the [[Cultural Revolution Group]].

==Early life==
Chen Boda was born '''Chen Jianxiang''' ({{zh|s=陈建相|t=陳建相|p=Chén Jiànxiāng |poj=Tân kiàn siong}}) in 1904 to peasant parents. His [[courtesy name]] was '''Shangyou''' ({{zh|w=尚友 |p=Shàngyǒu}}). During his childhood, his family moved to [[Jimei District|Jimei]], in modern-day [[Xiamen]], likely to facilitate young Chen's enrollment at the Jimei Normal School. In 1925, Chen enrolled at Shanghai Labor University, and in 1927 he joined the Communist Party of China. After returning to Fujian, he was hired as the personal secretary of General [[Zhang Zhen (general)|Zhang Zhen]], helping to prepare for the 1926–1927 [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] from the CCP side of the [[First United Front]]. When the Front collapsed, Chen fled and was eventually arrested in [[Nanjing]]. He was released after a month on General Zhang's recommendation. Shortly thereafter, Chen was selected to study at [[Moscow Sun Yat-sen University|Sun Yat-sen University]] in [[Moscow]] for four years.&lt;ref name="Leung"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leung|first=Pak-Wah|title=Political Leaders of Modern China: A Biographical Dictionary|editor=Pak-Wah Leung|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|edition=Illustrated|pages=10–12|isbn=978-0-313-30216-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Chen Boda returned to China, and married [[Sichuan]] native Zhu Yuren, who had also studied in Moscow. Chen began teaching ancient Chinese history in Beijing while writing articles under the pen names '''Chen Zhimei''' and '''Chen Boda'''. Most of these articles focused on the dispute between advocates of "national defense literature" such as [[Lu Xun]], and more nationalist authors. Chen also did underground work for the Party in [[Tianjin]]. From 1937 on, he lectured at the Central Party School in [[Yan'an]], where he became a leader in the [[Yan'an Rectification Movement]]. He soon became personal research assistant and secretary to [[Mao Zedong]]. Chen published the first collection of Mao's writings in 1937, and an official history of the Party in 1945.&lt;ref name="Leung"/&gt;

==Role in the post-1949 government==

In 1951, he wrote an article with the title ''Mao Zedong's theory of the Chinese Revolution is the combination of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese Revolution'' and a book entitled ''Mao Zedong on the Chinese Revolution''. These works made him one of the most important interpreters of [[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]], and in the 1950s he became Mao's personal secretary and close associate, and compiled many of the quotations published in [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Meisner|Meisner, M]]; 'Mao's China and After: A History of the People's Republic since 1949'; Free Press (2006); p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he became the editor of the party journal ''[[Red Flag (magazine)|Red Flag]]''.

===Cultural Revolution===

[[File:1967-01 1966年毛泽东林彪周恩来陈伯达.jpg|thumb|Chen Boda (far right) with [[Mao Zedong]], [[Lin Biao]], and [[Zhou Enlai]] during the Cultural Revolution]]

From 1966 until 1969, Chen Boda was to play an important role in the [[Cultural Revolution]]. In May 1966, he was placed at the head of the newly formed [[Cultural Revolution Group]] (CRG), a body established to oversee and direct the course of the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Guillermaz, J; 'The Chinese Communist Party in Power, 1949-1976'; Westview Press (1976); p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;  In time, this group would rise to become the most important political body in China, surpassing even the influence of the [[Politburo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, R]] and Schoenhals, M; 'Mao's Last Revolution'; Belknap Harvard (2006); p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Chen Boda was also placed as head of the Communist government's propaganda apparatus alongside [[Jiang Qing]] when the previous leader, [[Lu Dingyi]], was deposed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Meisner, M; 'Mao's China and After: A History of the People's Republic since 1949'; Free Press (2006); p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;  He also became a member of the Standing Committee of the [[Politburo]].&lt;ref&gt;Meisner, M; 'Mao's China and After: A History of the People's Republic since 1949'; Free Press (2006); p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cultural Revolution Group began to show signs of ultra-leftism according to the Central Committee leadership, and Boda's reputation began to wane after the [[9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|9th Party Congress]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, R]] and Schoenhals, M; 'Mao's Last Revolution'; Belknap Harvard (2006); p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;  This marked the end of Chen Boda's involvement in the [[Cultural Revolution]].  As the leadership became more moderate in its outlook and the initial aims of the [[Cultural Revolution]] were sidelined, Chen's radicalism caused concern, and he was denounced at the [[10th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|10th Party Congress]] in 1973 as a 'revisionist secret agent' for his associations with [[Lin Biao]].&lt;ref&gt;Guillermaz, J; 'The Chinese Communist Party in Power, 1949-1976'; Westview Press (1976); p. 461&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After the Cultural Revolution, he was tried by the post-Mao government for collaboration with the [[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]].&lt;ref&gt;Meisner, M; ''Mao's China and After: A History of the People's Republic since 1949''; Free Press (2006); p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to eighteen years in prison, but was released shortly afterwards due to his ill health.  He died on 20 September 1989.

[[File:Doomsday clock (2 minutes).svg|thumb|96x96px|The Doomsday Clock pictured at its most recent setting of "two minutes to midnight"]]
The '''Doomsday Clock''' is a symbol which represents the likelihood of a man-made [[Global catastrophic risk|global catastrophe]]. Maintained since 1947 by the members of the  ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''{{'}} Science and Security Board,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thebulletin.org/science-and-security-board |title=Science and Security Board|work=The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; the clock represents an analogy for the threat of [[Nuclear holocaust|global nuclear war]]. Since 2007, it has also reflected [[global warming|climate change]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stover|first=Dawn|title=How Many Hiroshimas Does it Take to Describe Climate Change?|url=http://thebulletin.org/how-many-hiroshimas-does-it-take-describe-climate-change|website=The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new developments in the life sciences and technology that could inflict irrevocable harm to humanity.&lt;ref name="2007PressRelease"&gt;{{cite web

  |website=The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists
  |access-date=June 29, 2013
  |title='Doomsday Clock' Moves Two Minutes Closer To Midnight
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clock represents the hypothetical global catastrophe as "midnight" and ''The Bulletin''{{'}}s opinion on how close the world is to a global catastrophe as a number of "minutes" to midnight. Its original setting in 1947 was seven minutes to midnight. It has been set backward and forward 23 times since then, the smallest-ever number of minutes to midnight being two (in 1953 and 2018) and the largest seventeen (in 1991). {{As of|2018|January}}, the clock is set at two minutes to midnight, due to "the looming threats of nuclear war and climate change.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chan|first1=Sewell|title=Doomsday Clock Is Set at 2 Minutes to Midnight, Closest Since 1950s|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/world/americas/doomsday-clock-nuclear-scientists.html|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|access-date=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebulletin.org/timeline |website=The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|title=Timeline|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="It is two and a half minutes to midnight" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bulletin Atomic Scientists Cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1947 ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' issue, featuring the Doomsday Clock at "seven minutes to midnight"]]
The Doomsday Clock's origin can be traced to the international group of researchers called the Chicago Atomic Scientists, who had participated in the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref name="The Spokesman-Review"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=20061016&amp;id=tGdWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MvMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5932,5424494 |title=Doomsday Clock moving closer to midnight?|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|date=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], they began publishing a [[mimeograph]]ed newsletter and then the magazine, ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', which, since its inception, has depicted the clock on every cover. The clock was first represented in 1947, when ''The Bulletin'' co-founder Hyman Goldsmith asked artist [[Martyl Langsdorf]] (wife of [[Manhattan Project]] research associate and [[Szilárd petition]] signatory [[Alexander Langsdorf, Jr.]]) to design a cover for the magazine's June 1947 issue. As [[Eugene Rabinowitch]], another co-founder of ''The Bulletin'', explained later, {{quote|The Bulletin's clock is not a gauge to register the ups and downs of the international power struggle; it is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&amp;dat=19840222&amp;id=tbcfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p9cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2249,3820904 |title=The Doomsday Clock|newspaper=The Southeast Missourian|date= February 22, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Langsdorf chose a clock to reflect the urgency of the problem: like a countdown, the clock suggests that destruction will naturally occur unless someone takes action to stop it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Running the 'Doomsday Clock' is a full-time job.

In January 2007, designer [[Michael Bierut]], who was on ''The Bulletin''{{'}}s Governing Board, redesigned the clock to give it a more modern feel. In 2009, ''The Bulletin'' ceased its print edition and became one of the first print publications in the U.S. to become entirely digital; the clock is now found as part of the logo on ''The Bulletin''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s website.

The 5th Doomsday Clock Symposium&lt;ref name="Doomsday Clock Symposium"/&gt; was held on November 14, 2013, in Washington, D.C.; it was a day-long event that was open to the public and featured panelists discussing various issues on the topic "Communicating Catastrophe".

===Changes===
"Midnight" has a deeper meaning to it besides the constant threat of war. There are various things taken into consideration when the scientists from The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists decide what Midnight and Global catastrophe really mean in a particular year. They might include "Politics, Energy, Weapons, Diplomacy, and Climate science."&lt;ref name="NPR.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/26/511592700/the-doomsday-clock-is-now-30-seconds-closer-to-midnight|title=The Doomsday Clock Is Reset: Closest To Midnight Since The 1950s|work=NPR.org|access-date=April 18, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential sources of threat included nuclear threats, climate change, bioterrorism, and artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Emily|title=What is the Doomsday Clock and why does it matter?|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-the-doomsday-clock|accessdate=January 29, 2018|date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the board judge Midnight by discussing how close they think humanity is to the end of civilization. In 1947, during the [[Cold War]], the clock was started at seven minutes to midnight.  The clock's setting is decided without a specified starting time. The clock is not set and reset in real time as events occur; rather than respond to each and every crisis as it happens, the Science and Security Board meets twice annually to discuss global events in a deliberative manner. The closest nuclear war threat, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962, reached crisis, climax, and resolution before the clock could be set to reflect that possible doomsday.

=== Changing settings ===
The two tied-for-lowest points for the Doomsday Clock have been in 1953, when the clock was set to two minutes until midnight after the U.S. and the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs, and in 2018, following the failure of world leaders to address tensions relating to nuclear weapons and climate change issues. In other years, the clock’s time has fluctuated from 17 minutes in 1991 to 2 minutes 30 seconds in 2017.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thebulletin.org/timeline|title=Timeline|work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|access-date=April 18, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Closer"/&gt; Discussing the change to 2½ minutes in 2017, the first use of a fraction in the clock's history, Krauss, one of the scientists from the Bulletin, warned that our political leaders must make decisions based on facts, and those facts "must be taken into account if the future of humanity is to be preserved."&lt;ref name="NPR.org"/&gt; In an announcement from the Bulletin about the status of the clock, they went as far to call for action from “wise” public officials and “wise” citizens to make an attempt to steer human life away from catastrophe while we still can.&lt;ref name="Timeline"/&gt; In January 2018, the clock was lowered further to 2 minutes to midnight, meaning that the clock's status today is tied for closest to midnight since the clock’s start in 1947.&lt;ref name="Closer"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/25/politics/doomsday-clock-closer-nuclear-midnight/index.html|title='Doomsday clock' ticks closer to apocalyptic midnight|last=Koran|first=Laura|work=[[CNN]]|date=January 25, 2018|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The Doomsday Clock has become a universally recognized metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doomsday Clock Moves Closer To Midnight, We're 2 Minutes From World Annihilation|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/25/580670125/doomsday-clock-moves-closer-to-midnight-were-2-minutes-from-world-annihilation|accessdate=January 29, 2018|work=The Two-Way ([[NPR]])|date=January 25, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Bulletin'', the clock attracts more daily visitors to the Bulletin's site than any other feature.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barasch|first1=Alex|title=What The Doomsday Clock Doesn’t Tell Us|url=https://slate.com/technology/2018/01/what-the-doomsday-clock-doesnt-tell-us.html|accessdate=January 29, 2018|work=Slate Magazine|date=January 26, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anders Sandberg]] of the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] has stated that the "grab bag of threats" currently mixed together by the clock can induce paralysis. People may be more likely to succeed at smaller, incremental challenges; for example, taking steps to prevent the accidental detonation of nuclear weapons was a small but significant step in avoiding nuclear war.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Sewell|title=Doomsday Clock Is Set at 2 Minutes to Midnight, Closest Since 1950s|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/world/americas/doomsday-clock-nuclear-scientists.html|accessdate=January 29, 2018|work=The New York Times|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is the Doomsday Clock Still Relevant?|url=https://www.livescience.com/53801-doomsday-clock-relevance.html|accessdate=January 29, 2018|work=Live Science|date=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Barasch in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' argues that "Putting humanity on a permanent, blanket high-alert isn't helpful when it comes to policy or science", and criticizes the ''Bulletin'' for neither explaining nor attempting to quantify their methodology.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

Conservative media often clash against the ''Bulletin''. Keith Payne writes in the ''[[National Review]]'' that the clock overestimates the effects of "developments in the areas of nuclear testing and formal arms control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Precision Prediction|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/228975/precision-prediction-keith-b-payne|accessdate=January 29, 2018|work=National Review|date=January 18, 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tristin Hopper in the ''[[National Post]]'' acknowledges that "there are plenty of things to worry about regarding climate change", but states that climate change isn't in the same league as total nuclear destruction.&lt;ref name="national post"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the Doomsday Clock is an idiotic indicator the world’s media should ignore|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/world/why-the-doomsday-clock-is-an-idiotic-indicator-the-worlds-media-should-ignore|accessdate=January 29, 2018|work=National Post|date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some critics accuse the ''Bulletin'' of pushing a political agenda.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name="national post"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doomsday Clock moves closer to midnight|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doomsday-clock-destroying-civilization-scientists-president-trump/|accessdate=January 29, 2018|date=January 26, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Ludwig Dümmler''' (2 January 1830 – 11 September 1902) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian]].

== Biography ==
Ernst Ludwig was born in [[Berlin]], the son of {{ill|Ferdinand Dümmler, Sr.|de|Ferdinand Dümmler}} (1777–1846), a Berlin bookseller. He studied [[law]], [[Classics|classical philology]] and [[history]], among other things, at [[university of Bonn|Bonn]] under [[Johann Wilhelm Löbell]], and in [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], where his influences were [[Leopold von Ranke]] and [[Wilhelm Wattenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd116238909.html#ndbcontent Dümmler, Ernst Ludwig] In: [[Neue Deutsche Biographie]] (NDB). Band 4, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Berlin 1959, {{ISBN|3-428-00185-0}}, S. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; His doctorate dissertation, ''De Arnulfo Francorum rege'' (Berlin, 1852), was a notable essay among historians.

He entered the faculty at [[university of Halle|Halle]] in 1855, and started an historical seminar. In 1858 he became an associate professor, in 1866 full professor. In 1875, he became a member of the revised committee directing the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', himself undertaking the direction of the section "Antiquitates". In 1888 he became president of the central board in Berlin. This was an official recognition of Dümmler's leading position among German historians.

His son, [[Ferdinand Dümmler|Georg Ferdinand Dümmler]] (1859–1896), was a classical [[philologist]] and [[archaeologist]].

== Selected works ==
In addition to numerous critical works and editions of texts, he published:
* ''Piligrim von Passau und das Erzbistum Lorch'' (1854) – [[Pilgrim of Passau|Piligrim of Passau]] and the [[Archdiocese of Laureacum]].
* ''Uber die älteste geschichte der Slawen in Dalmatien, 549-928'' (1856) – On the early history of the Slavs in [[Dalmatia]] (549-928)
* ''Das Formelbuch des Bischofs Salomo III von Konstanz aus dem neunten Jahrhundert'' (1857) – [[Formulary (model document)|Formulary]] of [[Solomon III (bishop of Constance)|Bishop Solomon III of Constance]] from the ninth century.
* ''Anselm Der Peripatetiker'' (1872) – [[Anselm the Peripatetic]].
His great work was the ''Geschichte des ostfrankischen Reiches'' (Berlin, 1862–1865, 2 volumes; 2nd ed. 1887–1888, in 3 volumes). In conjunction with Wattenbach he completed the ''Monumenta Alcuiniana'' (Berlin, 1873), which had been begun by [[Philipp Jaffé]], and with [[Rudolf Köpke]] he wrote ''Kaiser Otto der Grosse'' (Leipzig, 1876).

He edited the anonymous [[Lorsch riddles]] twice—first in 1879 and then again two years later in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Anglo-Saxon Psychologies in the Vernacular and Latin Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMVycdqSh28C |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=2011-01-01 |isbn=978-1-4426-4217-1 |first=Leslie |last=Lockett}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the first and second volumes of the "Poetae latini aevi Carolini" for the ''Monumenta Germaniae historica'' (Berlin, 1881–84).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k952535 Poetae latini aevi Carolini. Tomus 1-2] Gallica&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
His son, [[Ferdinand Dümmler]] (1859–1896), an archaeologist and philologist, was professor at the [[University of Basel]] from 1890 until his death on 15 November 1896, aged 37.

[[Dr.]] '''Farish Ahmad Noor''' (born 15 May 1967 in [[George Town, Penang|Georgetown]], [[Penang]]) is a political scientist and historian and is Associate Professor at the [[S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies|Rajaratnam School of International Studies]] as well as the School of History (SoH) of the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) at the [[Nanyang Technological University]], [[Singapore]].

He was formerly attached to [[Zentrum Moderner Orient]] ([[Centre for Modern Oriental Studies]]) in [[Berlin, Germany]], Sciences-Po Paris, the Institute for the Study of Muslim Society (IISMM, Ecole des haute études en sciences sociale, EHESS), Paris and the International Institute for the Study of the Muslim World (ISIM), Leiden, Netherlands.
Dr. Noor's teaching credits include the Centre for Civilisational Dialogue, [[University of Malaya]], the Institute for Islamic Studies, [[Free University Berlin]], Sunan Kalijaga Islamic University (Jogjakarta), Muhamadiyah University Surakarta and Nanyang Technological University.

At NTU/RSIS he teaches two courses: (1) History, Society and Politics of Southeast Asia and (2) Introduction to Philosophy of Language and Discourse Analysis. The first is part of the RSIS area studies curricula (which also covers Indonesia) while the second is a foundational course in Philosophy of Language, Linguistics and Semiotics with a heavy emphasis on Critical Theory as developed by the Essex School of Discourse Analysis.

He received his BA in Philosophy &amp; Literature from the [[University of Sussex]] in 1989, before studying for an MA in Philosophy at the same University in 1990, an MA in South-East Asian Studies at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] in London, before completing his PhD at the [[University of Essex]] in 1997 in the field of governance and politics.

His main area of research has been Southeast Asia in the 19th century. Over the past ten years he has also been researching the phenomenon of transnational and translocal religio-political movements, including missionary movements such as the Tablighi Jama'at and its networks from South to Southeast Asia; as well as the development of religio-politics in South and Southeast Asia, looking at the rise of Muslim, Christian and Hindu political-religious revivalism in particular (see "Islam" in Richter &amp; Mar 2004).

His other interests include antiques and material history, and he has written about the plastic arts of Southeast Asia, focusing on things such as the Indonesian-Malaysian keris to the development of woodcarving and architecture. 

He also hosted a documentary on [[Channel NewsAsia]] called 'Inside Indonesia with Dr Farish'.&lt;ref name=cna&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/tv/tvshows/inside-indonesia/state-of-the-nation/1072428.html |title=Inside Indonesia with Dr Farish |publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]] |date= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cna2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toggle.sg/en/series/inside-indonesia-with-dr-farish-catch-up/281837 |title=Inside Indonesia with Dr Farish |publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]] |date= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
{{main|Female infanticide in India}}
The British colonial authorities passed the ''Female Infanticide Prevention Act 1870'', under pressure of Christian missionaries and social reformers seeking an end to the incidences of female infanticides in South Asia. The law's preamble stated that the murder of female infants is believed to be commonly committed in certain parts of British India, and these were Oudh, North-Western Provinces and Punjab.&lt;ref name=fipa1/&gt; The Act initially applied to these regions.&lt;ref&gt;Section 7 of {{Google books|OvYZAAAAYAAJ|The Unrepealed General Acts of the Governor General in Council|page=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law authorized the creation of a police force to maintain birth, marriage and death registers, to conduct census of the district at its discretion, enforce a special tax on the district to pay for the expenses and entertainment of said police officers.&lt;ref name=fipa1/&gt; The Act also stipulated a prison sentence of six months or a fine of thirty thousand rupees, or both, on anyone who disobeyed or obstructed the police officers enforcing the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2-4 of {{Google books|OvYZAAAAYAAJ|The Unrepealed General Acts of the Governor General in Council|page=PA166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 6 of the Act allowed the police officer to seize a child from any person he suspects may neglect or endanger any female child, as well as force collect a monthly fee from that person.&lt;ref&gt;Section 6 of {{Google books|OvYZAAAAYAAJ|The Unrepealed General Acts of the Governor General in Council|page=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
The Act was in force till 1981 in Pakistan, when it was superseded by an ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;Tahir Wasti, The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan: Sharia in Practice, p. 140 footnote 137, BRILL Netherlands (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fusang''' ({{zh|c=扶桑|p=Fú Sāng}}) refers to several different entities in ancient Chinese literature, often either a mythological tree or a mysterious land to the East.

In the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'' and several contemporary texts,&lt;ref name="Needham43"/&gt; the term refers to a mythological [[tree of life]], alternately identified as a [[mulberry]] or [[hibiscus]], allegedly growing far to the east of China, and perhaps to various more concrete territories east of the mainland.&lt;ref name="Needham43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Needham53"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Needham|title=Science and civilisation in China | volume=5 : Chemistry and chemical technology | section=Part 3, Spagyrical discovery and invention : historical survey, from cinnabar elixirs to synthetic insulin|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-21028-7|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A country named Fusang was described by the native Buddhist missionary Hui Shen ({{zh|c=慧深|p=Huì Shēn}}) in 499 AD,&lt;ref&gt;《梁書•諸夷列傳》 (Collective Biographies of Foreign Countries, ''Book of Liang''): 扶桑國者，齊永元元年，其國有沙門慧深來至荊州，说云：“扶桑在大漢國東二萬餘里，（……）” （The country of Fusang, in the year Yong-yuan 1 of the Qi Dynasty, a Shramana monk from there called Hui Shen came to Jingzhou, and said: "Fusang is 20,000 li to the East of the country of Dàhàn，(......)"&lt;/ref&gt; as a place 20,000 Chinese ''[[Li (length)|li]]'' east of Da-han, and also east of China (according to [[Joseph Needham]], Da-han corresponds to the [[Buryatia|Buriat]] region of Siberia).&lt;ref name="Needham43"/&gt; Hui Shen went by ship to Fusang, and upon his return reported his findings to the Chinese Emperor. His descriptions are recorded in the 7th-century text ''[[Book of Liang]]'' by [[Yao Silian]], and describe a [[Bronze Age]] civilization inhabiting the Fusang country. The Fusang described by Shen has been variously posited to be the Americas, [[Sakhalin]] island, the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] or the [[Kuril Islands]]. The American hypothesis was the most hotly debated one in the late 19th and early 20th century after the 18th-century writings of [[Joseph de Guignes]] were revived and disseminated by [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] in 1875. [[Sinologist]]s including [[Emil Bretschneider]], [[Berthold Laufer]], and [[Henri Cordier]] refuted this hypothesis however, and according to Needham the American hypothesis was all but refuted by the time of the First World War.&lt;ref name="Needham43"/&gt;

Later Chinese accounts used the name Fusang for other, even less well identified places.&lt;ref name="Needham43"/&gt;

An earlier account claims that in 219 BC, emperor [[Qin Shi Huang|Shi Huang]] sent an expedition of some 3,000 convicts to a place lying far off to the east, across the ocean, called Fusang, to be a sacrifice to a volcano god who held the elixir of life. There were, apparently, two expeditions under [[Xu Fu]], the court sorcerer, to seek the [[elixir of life]]. The first expedition returned c. 210 BC when Xufu claimed a giant sea creature was blocking their path. Archers were then sent to deal with this monster when the expedition set out a second time, but it was never heard from again. However, "...&amp;nbsp;asides in the ''Record of the Historian'' imply that its leader Xu Fu had returned to China long ago and was lurking somewhere near [[Langya]], frittering away the expedition's impressive budget."&lt;ref name="JC"&gt;[[Jonathan Clements|Clements, Jonathan]] (2007). ''The First Emperor of China''. Sutton Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-7509-3960-7}}. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations of the Shen account==

===Eastern Japan===
[[Japan]] was one interpretation of the term ''Fusang''. However, Hui Shen's report differentiates Fusang from the ancient Japanese kingdom of [[Wa (Japan)|Wo]], which has been tentatively located in [[Kinki region|Kinki]], [[Kyūshū]], or the [[Ryukyu Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsunoda Ryusaku, tr. (1951), ''Japan in the Chinese Dynastic Histories: Later Han Through Ming Dynasties'', ed. by Carrington C. Goodrich, South Pasadena: P. D. and Ione Perkins, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese mythology]], Fusang refers to a divine tree and island in the East, from where the sun rises. A similar tree, known as Ruomu (若木) exists in the west, and each morning the sun was said to rise from Fusang and fall on Ruomu. Chinese legend has ten birds (typically ravens) living in the tree, and as nine rested, the tenth would carry the sun on its journey. This legend has similarities with the Chinese tale of the fictional hero [[Houyi]], sometimes referred to as the Archer, who is credited with saving the world by shooting down nine of the suns when one day all ten took to the air simultaneously. Some scholars have identified the bronze trees found at the archaeological site [[Sanxingdui]] with these Fusang trees.

The term Fusang would later designate 'Japan' in [[Chinese poetry]]. Since Japanese ''Nihon'' (日本, lit. 'Root [''i.e.'' source, birthplace, origin] of the Sun') or Chinese ''Riben'' was a [[Names of Japan|name of Japan]], some [[Tang dynasty]] poets believed Fusang "lay between the mainland and Japan." For instance, [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] wrote a 753 farewell poem when [[Abe no Nakamaro]] (Chinese Zhao Heng 晁衡) returned to Japan, "The trees of your home are beyond Fu-sang."&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, Edward H. (1989), "Fusang and Beyond: The Haunted Seas to Japan," ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 109.3: 379, 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fusang is pronounced ''[[Fuso (disambiguation)|Fusō]]'' (ふそう　扶桑, from classical ''Fusau'' ふさう) in the Japanese language, and is one of the names to designate ancient Japan. Several warships of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] were named ''Fusō'' (the ironclad [[Japanese ironclad warship Fusō|''Fusō'']], or the World War II battleship [[Japanese battleship Fusō|''Fusō'']]). Several companies, such as [[Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation]], also bear the name.

[[Gustaaf Schlegel]] thought Fusang was most probably "the long island of [[Karafuto]] or [[Sakhalin]]". [[Joseph Needham]] added that "if [[Kamchatka]] and the [[Kuriles]] may also be considered there is no better means of identifying it at the present day."&lt;ref name="Needham43"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Joseph Needham]]|author2=Ling Wang|author3=Gwei-Djen|title=Science and civilisation in China| volume=4, Physics and physical technology|section=Pt. 3, Civil engineering and nautics|year=1971|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-07060-7|pages=540–542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that there was an ancient province of Japan called [[Fusa Province|''Fusa-no kuni'']] ('Country of Fusa') in eastern Honshū, encompassing all of modern [[Chiba Prefecture]] as well as the southwestern part of modern [[Ibaraki Prefecture]].

===The Americas===
[[Image:Buache1753Map.jpg|thumb|This 1753 map by the French cartographer [[Philippe Buache]] locates Fusang ("''Fou-sang des Chinois''", 'Fusang of the Chinese') north of [[California]], in the area of [[British Columbia]].]]
According to some historians such as [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] and [[Joseph de Guignes]] (''Le Fou-Sang des Chinois est-il l'Amérique?'' Mémoires de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, tome 28, Paris, 1761), the distances given by Hui Shen (20,000 Chinese ''li'') would locate Fusang on the west coast of the American continent, when taking the ancient Han-period definition of the Chinese ''li''. Some 18th-century European maps locate Fusang north of [[California]], in the area of [[British Columbia]]. An American location does not match the claim for horses (which did not exist in North or South America at that time) or the domestication and milking of deer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth L. Feder]], ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum'', page 117 (Greenwood, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-313-37919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions of Fusang==
{{See also|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
[[Image:1792FrenchWorldMapWithFusang.JPG|thumb|Mention of Fusang ("''Fousang des Chinois''") on a 1792 French world map, in the area of modern British Columbia.]]
According to the report of Hui Shen to the Chinese during his visit to China, described in the ''Liang Shu'':

:"Fusang is 20,000 li to the East of the country of ''Dàhàn'' (lit. 'Great Han'), and located to the east of China (lit. 'Middle Kingdom')."
:"On that land, there are many Fusang plants (perhaps [[red mulberry]]) that produce oval-shaped leaves similar to paulownia and edible purplish-red fruits like pears. The place was rich in copper and traces of gold and silver but no iron. The native tribes in Fusang were civilized, living in well-organized communities. They produced paper from the bark of the Fusang plants for writing and produced cloth from the fibers of the bark, which they used for robes or wadding. Their houses or cabins were constructed with red mulberry wood. The fruits and young shoots of the plants were one of their food sources. They raised deer for meat and milk, just as the Chinese raised cattle at home, and produced cheese with deer milk. They traveled on horseback and transported their goods with carts or sledges pulled by horses, buffalo, or deer."&lt;ref name=lily&gt;Chow, Lily (2001) [[Liang Shu]], in ''Chasing Their Dreams. Chinese Settlement in the Northwest Region of British Columbia'', Caitlin, {{ISBN|978-0-920576-83-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the organization of the country:
:"An emperor, or a main chief, with the help of several officials, governed the country. The majority of people were law-abiding citizens. The country had no army or military defense but two jails, one in the north and the other in the south of the country. Those who had committed serious crimes were sent to the north and they stayed there for their entire lives. These inmates, however, could get married. If they got married and produced children, their sons became slaves and their daughters remained as maids"&lt;ref name=lily/&gt;

On the social practices:
:"The marriage arrangement was relatively simple. If a boy wanted to marry a girl, he had to build a cabin next to the home of the girl and stay there for a year. If the girl liked him they would get married; otherwise he would be asked to go away ... When a person died in the community his body would be cremated. The mourning period varied from seven days for the death of a parent to five days for a grandparent and three days for a brother or sister. During their mourning period they were not supposed to consume food, only water. They had no religion."&lt;ref name=lily/&gt;

The Liang Shu also describes the conversion of Fusang to the Buddhist faith by five Buddhist monks from [[Gandhara]]:

:"In former times, the people of Fusang knew nothing of the Buddhist religion, but in the second year of [[Emperor Ming of Liu Song|Da Ming]] of the [[Liu Song dynasty]] (485 AD), five monks from Kipin ([[Kabul]] region of Gandhara) travelled by ship to that country. They propagated Buddhist doctrine, circulated scriptures and drawings, and advised the people to relinquish worldly attachments. As a result, the customs of Fusang changed".

'''Ignatius Sancho''' (c. 1729 – 14 December 1780) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] composer, actor, and writer. He is the first known Briton of African heritage to vote in a [[British election]]. He gained fame in his time as "the extraordinary Negro", and to eighteenth-century British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]] he became a symbol of the humanity of Africans and immorality of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carey|first=Brycchan|title=Ignatius Sancho: African Man of Letters|url=http://www.brycchancarey.com/sancho/|publisher=Brycchan Carey|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho, an African'', edited and published two years after his death, is one of the earliest accounts of African slavery written in English by a former [[slavery|slave]] of Spanish and English families.

==Biography==
Ignatius Sancho was born on a [[slave ship]] in 1729; his precise birthplace is thus unknown. After his mother died in the Spanish colony of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] and his father killed himself rather than live as a slave, Sancho was taken to England. From 1731 to 1749, he worked for three maiden sisters in [[Greenwich]]. [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu]] (of the first creation) (1690–1749), impressed by Sancho's intellect, frankness, and his amiability, not only encouraged him to read, but also lent him books from his personal library at Blackheath. Sancho's informal education made his lack of freedom in Greenwich unbearable, and he ran away to the Montagus in 1749. For two years until her death in 1751, Sancho worked as the [[butler]] for [[Mary Montagu, Duchess of Montagu|Mary Montagu (née Churchill), Duchess of Montagu]], at [[Montagu House, Blackheath|Montagu House]], where he flourished by immersing himself in music, poetry, reading, and writing.&lt;ref name=ellis1996&gt;{{cite book |author=Ellis, Markman |title=The Politics of Sensibility: Race, Gender and Commerce in the Sentimental Novel |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=walvin1997&gt;{{cite book |author=Walvin, James |year=1997 |chapter=Ignatius Sancho: The Man and His Times |editor=King, Reyahn |title=Ignatius Sancho: an African Man of Letters |publisher=National Portrait Gallery |location=London, UK |page=96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At her death in 1751 he received an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] of £30 and a year's salary, which he quickly squandered.&lt;ref name=ellis1996 /&gt;

During the 1760s Sancho married a West Indian woman, Ann Osborne. He became a devoted husband and father. They had seven children: Frances Joanna (1761–1815), Ann Alice (1763–1805), Elizabeth Bruce (1766–1837), Jonathan William (1768–1770), Lydia (1771–1776), Katherine Margaret (1773–1779), and William Leach Osborne (1775–1810).&lt;ref name=Brycchanweb /&gt; Around the time of the birth of their third child, Sancho became a valet to the [[George Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu]] (of the second creation), son-in-law of his earlier patron.&lt;ref name=ellis1996 /&gt; He remained there until 1773.

In 1768 [[Thomas Gainsborough]] painted a portrait of Sancho at the same time as the Duchess of Montagu sat for her portrait by the artist.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;According to King (1997:28-9), there is an inscription by antiquarian William Stevenson on the back of the canvas stating that Gainsborough completed the portrait in one hour and 40 minutes on 29 November 1768. Stevenson was the person Sancho corresponded with most frequently. This was the same time as the Duchess had her portrait done. Representations of African subjects typically reflected the artist's ideological view of slavery. Few African people were portrayed with the depth of feeling evoked in this portrait. Gainsborough conveys both the warmth and humour of Sancho's personality and his refined gentlemanly qualities. This is a sharp contrast to contemporary stereotypical images of African people. For this reason Gainsborough's portrait is exceptional. King argued that the Sancho portrait is the most accomplished portrait of an African person in British portraiture of the time (King 1997:30). Bartolozzi's 1781 engraving based on Gainsborough's portrait of Sancho, was used as the frontispiece when Sancho's Letters were published.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1760s Sancho had already become accomplished and was considered by many to be a man of refinement.&lt;ref name=ellis1996 /&gt;

In 1766, at the height of the debate about slavery, Sancho wrote to [[Laurence Sterne]]&lt;ref name=carey2003&gt;{{cite journal

In July 1766 Sancho's letter was received by Reverend Laurence Sterne shortly after he had just finished writing a conversation between his fictional characters, Corporal Trim and his brother Tom in ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', wherein Tom described the oppression of an African servant in a sausage shop in Lisbon that he had visited.&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurence Sterne's widely publicised 27 July 1766 response to Sancho's letter became an integral part of 18th-century abolitionist literature.{{quote|There is a strange coincidence, Sancho, in the little events (as well as in the great ones) of this world: for I had been writing a tender tale of the sorrows of a friendless poor negro-girl, and my eyes had scarce done smarting with it, when your letter of recommendation in behalf of so many of her brethren and sisters, came to me—but why her brethren?—or your’s, Sancho! any more than mine? It is by the finest tints, and most insensible gradations, that nature descends from the fairest face about St. James’s, to the sootiest complexion in Africa: at which tint of these, is it, that the ties of blood are to cease? and how many shades must we descend lower still in the scale, ’ere mercy is to vanish with them?—but ’tis no uncommon thing, my good Sancho, for one half of the world to use the other half of it like brutes, &amp; then endeavor to make ’em so."&lt;ref name=Norton /&gt; }}

Following the publication of the Sancho-Sterne letters, Sancho became widely known as a man of letters.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;

Sancho, an African participant and voter in Westminster, noted that despite being in Britain since the age of two he felt he was "only a lodger, and hardly that." In other writings he describes: "Went by water - had a coach home - were gazed at - followed, etc. etc. - but not much abused." On another occasion, he writes: "They stopped us in the town and most generously insulted us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_loUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=we+went+by+water+sancho&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xKG0oXWyHQ&amp;sig=43eKyiq4YLdwssyX_Sb7nCM9_GQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK2MLviIbWAhWLJMAKHarNChYQ6AEIQTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=gazed%20at&amp;f=false|title=Sancho's Letters, with Memoirs of His Life|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9JWvCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=sancho+the+national+antipathy+and+prejudice&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T4toHAoX1d&amp;sig=lEkQtOiKDdmgu5IfwAejVZ0hTlg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPot_XhIbWAhXMB8AKHdcXB6sQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=sancho%20the%20national%20antipathy%20and%20prejudice&amp;f=false|title=England, Slaves and Freedom, 1776–1838|last=p83|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774 with help from Montagu, Sancho, suffering from ill health with [[gout]], opened a greengrocery shop, offering merchandise such as tobacco, sugar and tea, at 19 Charles Street in London's Mayfair, [[Westminster]].&lt;ref name=CouncilWestminster&gt;{{cite book |url=http://transact.westminster.gov.uk/abolition/7-fco.cfm |title=Audio Guide to the Road to Abolition Trail |chapter=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office and King Charles Street and Ignatius Sancho |author=City Council of Westminster }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;This is now a heritage site included in tours of Westminster.

As shopkeeper Sancho enjoyed more time to socialise, correspond with his many friends, share his enjoyment of literature, and he attracted many people to his shop. He wrote and published a ''Theory of Music'' and two plays. As a financially independent male householder living in Westminster, he qualified to vote in the parliamentary elections of 1774 and 1780; he was the first person of African origin known to have voted in Britain. At this time he also wrote letters and in newspapers, under his own name and under the pseudonym "Africanus". He supported the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]] and British forces in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

Among his acquaintances were celebrated figures such as [[Thomas Gainsborough]], the Shakespearean actor [[David Garrick]], violin virtuoso [[Felice Giardini]], the preacher [[William Dodd (priest)|Dr. Dodd]],&lt;ref name=ellis1996 /&gt; the renowned sculptor [[Joseph Nollekens]], and the novelist [[Laurence Sterne]]. Nollekin gave Sancho a plaster cast of his c. 1766 marble bust of Laurence Sterne ([[National Portrait Gallery, London]]). Sancho received many prominent visitors at his shop, including statesman and abolitionist [[Charles James Fox]] [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (1749–1806), who successfully steered a resolution through Parliament pledging it to abolish the slave trade. He oversaw a Foreign Slave Trade Bill in spring 1806 that prohibited British subjects from contributing to the trading of slaves with the colonies of Britain's wartime enemies, thus eliminating two-thirds of the slave trade passing through British ports.&lt;ref name="PO"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Powell, Jim |date=September 1996 |title=Charles James Fox, Valiant Voice for Liberty |journal=The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty |volume=46 |number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Charles James Fox was Britain's first foreign secretary (1782, 1783, 1806).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignatius Sancho died from the effects of gout on 14 December 1780. He was the first person of African descent known to be given an obituary in the British press.

In 1782 [[Frances Crewe]], a correspondent with Sancho, arranged for 160 of his letters to be published in the form of two-volumes entitled, ''The Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho, an African''. The book sold very well, with more than 2000 subscribing to it. His widow received more than £500 in royalties. [[Joseph Jekyll (1754–1837)|Joseph Jekyll]] provided the memoirs to the first edition, which was reprinted with each additional edition including the fifth edition published by Sancho's son in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brycchancarey.com/sancho/jekyll.htm |author=Carey, Brycchan |title=Joseph Jekyll – Ignatius Sancho's Biographer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, William Leach Osborne, inherited the shop and transformed it into a printing and book-selling business.

===On slavery===
Sancho was unusually blunt in his response to a letter from Jack Wingrave, John Wingrave's son. Jack wrote about his negative reaction to people of colour based on his own experience in India during the 1770s. Sancho's friend, John was a London bookbinder and bookseller.&lt;ref name=careyslavery&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brycchancarey.com/sancho/letter4.htm |author=Carey, Brycchan |title=Sancho's Views on Empire and Slavery }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am sorry to observe that the practice of your country (which as a resident I love – and for its freedom – and for the many blessings I enjoy in it – shall ever have my warmest wishes, prayers and blessings); I say it is with reluctance, that I must observe your country's conduct has been uniformly wicked in the East – West-Indies – and even on the coast of Guinea. The grand object of English navigators – indeed of all Christian navigators – is money – money – money – for which I do not pretend to blame them – Commerce was meant by the goodness of the Deity to diffuse the various goods of the earth into every part – to unite mankind in the blessed chains of brotherly love – society – and mutual dependence: the enlightened Christian should diffuse the riches of the Gospel of peace – with the commodities of his respective land – Commerce attended with strict honesty – and with Religion for its companion – would be a blessing to every shore it touched at. In Africa, the poor wretched natives blessed with the most fertile and luxuriant soil – are rendered so much the more miserable for what Providence meant as a blessing: the Christians' abominable traffic for slaves and the horrid cruelty and treachery of the petty Kings encouraged by their Christian customers who carry them strong liquors to enflame their national madness – and powder – and bad fire-arms – to furnish them with the hellish means of killing and kidnapping.&lt;ref name=careyslavery /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ignatius Sancho |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/sancho2/sancho2.html |chapter=&lt;!--Letter to Jack Wingrave--&gt; |title=Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho |year=1778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Plaque_to_Ignatius_Sancho,_site_of_Montagu_House.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque in Greenwich Park]]
*A plaque to the memory of Sancho was unveiled on 15 June 2007, by [[Nick Raynsford]], MP for [[Greenwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenwich]], on the remaining wall of Montagu House on the south-west boundary of [[Greenwich Park]]. The plaque was funded by Friends of Greenwich Park to commemorate the bicentenary of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Abolition of the Slave Trade Act]], made law in 1807. A second plaque to his memory is on the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]].
*When the city of Westminster commemorated the bicentenary by creating a walking tour of Westminster highlighting events and individuals involved in the campaign to abolish the slave trade, they included 19 Charles Street. This was a collaboration with historian [[S. I. Martin]], the [[National Gallery]], the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]], the [[Palace of Westminster]], [[Tate Britain]], Westminster City Archives, and Westminster City Council.&lt;ref name=CouncilWestminster /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14603">'''Instrumental convergence''' is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently [[intelligent agent]]s to pursue certain instrumental goals such as [[self-preservation]] and [[resource]] acquisition.

Instrumental convergence suggests that an intelligent agent with apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example, a computer with the sole goal of solving the [[Riemann hypothesis]] could attempt to turn the entire Earth into [[computronium]] in an effort to increase its computing power so that it can succeed in its calculations.&lt;ref name=aama/&gt;

Proposed '''basic AI drives''' include utility function or goal-content integrity, self-protection, freedom from interference, [[self-improvement]], and non-satiable acquisition of additional resources.

==Instrumental and final goals==

{{See also|Instrumental value}}

Final goals, or final values, are intrinsically valuable to an intelligent agent, whether an [[artificial intelligence]] or a human being, as an [[ends-in-themselves|end in itself]]. In contrast, instrumental goals, or instrumental values, are only valuable to an agent as a means toward accomplishing its final goals. The contents and tradeoffs of a completely rational agent's "final goal" system can be formalized into a [[utility function]].

==Hypothetical examples of convergence==

One hypothetical example of instrumental convergence is provided by the [[Riemann Hypothesis]] catastrophe. [[Marvin Minsky]], the co-founder of [[MIT]]'s AI laboratory, has suggested that an artificial intelligence designed to solve the Riemann hypothesis might decide to take over all of Earth's resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal.&lt;ref name=aama&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart J.|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0137903952|chapter=Section 26.3: The Ethics and Risks of Developing Artificial Intelligence|quote="Similarly, Marvin Minsky once suggested that an AI program designed to solve the Riemann Hypothesis might end up taking over all the resources of Earth to build more powerful supercomputers to help achieve its goal."}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the computer had instead been programmed to produce as many paper clips as possible, it would still decide to take all of Earth's resources to meet its final goal.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom 2014, Chapter 8, p. 123. "An AI, designed to manage production in a factory, is given the final goal of maximizing the manufacturing of paperclips, and proceeds by converting first the Earth and then increasingly large chunks of the observable universe into paperclips."&lt;/ref&gt; Even though these two final goals are different, both of them produce a ''convergent'' instrumental goal of taking over Earth's resources.&lt;ref name="bostrom chapter 7" /&gt;

===Paperclip maximizer===
The paperclip maximizer is a [[thought experiment]] described by Swedish philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] in 2003. It illustrates the [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|existential risk]] that an [[artificial general intelligence]] may pose to human beings when programmed to pursue even seemingly-harmless goals, and the necessity of incorporating [[machine ethics]] into [[artificial intelligence]] design. The scenario describes an advanced artificial intelligence tasked with manufacturing paperclips. If such a machine were not programmed to value human life, then given enough power its optimized goal would be to turn all matter in the universe, including human beings, into either paperclips or machines which manufacture paperclips.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html|title = Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence|date = 2003|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = Bostrom|first = Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text = Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.|sign = |source = [[Nick Bostrom]], as quoted in {{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html|title=Artificial Intelligence May Doom The Human Race Within A Century, Oxford Professor Says}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html|title=Artificial Intelligence May Doom The Human Race Within A Century, Oxford Professor Says}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Bostrom has emphasised that he does not believe the paperclip maximiser scenario ''per se'' will actually occur; rather, his intention is to illustrate the dangers of creating [[Superintelligence|superintelligent]] machines without knowing how to safely program them to eliminate existential risk to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Are We Smart Enough to Control Artificial Intelligence?|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/review/534871/our-fear-of-artificial-intelligence/|website = MIT Technology Review|access-date = 25 January 2016|date = 11 February 2015|last = Ford|first = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paperclip maximizer example illustrates the broad problem of managing powerful systems that lack human values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friend|first1=Tad|title=Sam Altman’s Manifest Destiny|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny|accessdate=25 November 2017|work=The New Yorker|date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic AI drives==

[[Steve Omohundro]] has itemized several convergent instrumental goals, including [[self-preservation]] or self-protection, utility function or goal-content integrity, self-improvement, and resource acquisition. He refers to these as the "basic AI drives". A "drive" here denotes a "tendency which will be present unless specifically counteracted";&lt;ref&gt;Omohundro, S. M. (2008, February). The basic AI drives. In AGI (Vol. 171, pp. 483-492).&lt;/ref&gt; this is different from the psychological term "[[drive theory|drive]]", denoting an excitatory state produced by a homeostatic disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Seward, J. (1956). Drive, incentive, and reinforcement. Psychological Review, 63, 19-203.&lt;/ref&gt; A tendency for a person to fill out income tax forms every year is a "drive" in Omohundro's sense, but not in the psychological sense.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom 2014, footnote 8 to chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Dewey of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] argues that even an initially introverted self-rewarding AGI may continue to acquire free energy, space, time, and freedom from interference to ensure that it will not be stopped from self-rewarding.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, Daniel. "Learning what to value." Artificial General Intelligence (2011): 309-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goal-content integrity===

In humans, maintenance of final goals can be explained with a thought experiment. Suppose a man named "Gandhi" has a pill that, if he took it, would cause him to want to kill people. This Gandhi is currently a pacifist: one of his explicit final goals is to never kill anyone. Gandhi is likely to refuse to take the pill, because Gandhi knows that if in the future he wants to kill people, he is likely to actually kill people, and thus the goal of "not killing people" would not be satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. "Complex value systems in friendly AI." In Artificial general intelligence, pp. 388-393. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in other cases, people seem happy to let their final values drift. Humans are complicated, and their goals can be inconsistent or unknown, even to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom 2014, chapter 7, p. 110. "We humans often seem happy to let our final values drift... For example, somebody deciding to have a child might predict that they will come to value the child for its own sake, even though at the time of the decision they may not particularly value their future child... Humans are complicated, and many factors might be in play in a situation like this... one might have a final value that involves having certain experiences and occupying a certain social role; and become a parent&amp;mdash; and undergoing the attendant goal shift&amp;mdash; might be a necessary aspect of that..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====In artificial intelligence====

In 2009, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] concluded, in a setting where agents search for proofs about possible self-modifications, "that any rewrites of the utility function can happen only if the Gödel machine first can prove that the rewrite is useful according to the present utility function."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s12559-009-9014-y| title = Ultimate Cognition à la Gödel| journal = Cognitive Computation| volume = 1| issue = 2| pages = 177| year = 2009| last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = J. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hibbard&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2478/v10229-011-0013-5| title = Model-based Utility Functions| journal = Journal of Artificial General Intelligence| volume = 3| pages = 1| year = 2012| last1 = Hibbard | first1 = B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis by [[Bill Hibbard]] of a different scenario is similarly consistent with maintenance of goal content integrity.&lt;ref name=hibbard /&gt; Hibbard also argues that in a utility maximizing framework the only goal is maximizing expected utility, so that instrumental goals should be called unintended instrumental actions.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, Bill (2014): Ethical Artificial Intelligence. https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1373&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resource acquisition===

Many instrumental goals, such as [...] resource acquisition, are valuable to an agent because they increase its ''freedom of action''.&lt;ref name=formalizing&gt;Benson-Tilsen, T., &amp; Soares, N. (2016, March). Formalizing Convergent Instrumental Goals. In AAAI Workshop: AI, Ethics, and Society.&lt;/ref&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

For almost any open-ended, non-trivial reward function (or set of goals), possessing more resources (such as equipment, raw materials, or energy) can enable the AI to find a more "optimal" solution. Resources can benefit some AIs directly, through being able to create more of whatever stuff its reward function values: "The AI neither hates you, nor loves you, but you are made out of atoms that it can use for something else."&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. "Artificial intelligence as a positive and negative factor in global risk." Global catastrophic risks (2008): 303. p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shanahan 7.5"&gt;[[Murray Shanahan]]. ''The Technological Singularity''. MIT Press, 2015. Chapter 7, Section 5: "Safe Superintelligence".&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, almost all AIs can benefit from having more resources to spend on other instrumental goals, such as self-preservation.&lt;ref name="shanahan 7.5" /&gt;

===Cognitive enhancement===

"If the agent's final goals are fairly unbounded and the agent is in a position to become the first superintelligence and thereby obtain a decisive strategic advantage, [...] according to its preferences. At least in this special case, a rational intelligent agent would place a very *high instrumental value on cognitive enhancement*" &lt;ref name=super&gt;Bostrom, N. (2016). Superintelligence, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=September 2018}}

===Technological perfection===

Many instrumental goals, such as [...] technological advancement, are valuable to an agent because they increase its ''freedom of action''.&lt;ref name=formalizing/&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

===Self-preservation===

Many instrumental goals, such as [...] self-preservation, are valuable to an agent because they increase its ''freedom of action''.&lt;ref name=formalizing/&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

==Instrumental convergence thesis==

The instrumental convergence thesis, as outlined by philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]], states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Several instrumental values can be identified which are convergent in the sense that their attainment would increase the chances of the agent's goal being realized for a wide range of final goals and a wide range of situations, implying that these instrumental values are likely to be pursued by a broad spectrum of situated intelligent agents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The instrumental convergence thesis applies only to instrumental goals; intelligent agents may have a wide variety of possible final goals.&lt;ref name="bostrom chapter 7"&gt;Bostrom 2014, chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

Agents can acquire resources by trade or by conquest. A rational agent will, by definition, choose whatever option will maximize its implicit utility function; therefore a rational agent will trade for a subset of another agent's resources only if outright seizing the resources is too risky or costly (compared with the gains from taking all the resources), or if some other element in its utility function bars it from the seizure. In the case of a powerful, self-interested, rational superintelligence interacting with a lesser intelligence, peaceful trade (rather than unilateral seizure) seems unnecessary and suboptimal, and therefore unlikely.&lt;ref name=formalizing/&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

Some observers, such as Skype's [[Jaan Tallinn]] and physicist [[Max Tegmark]], believe that "basic AI drives", and other [[unintended consequences]] of superintelligent AI programmed by well-meaning programmers, could pose a significant threat to [[human survival]], especially if an "intelligence explosion" abruptly occurs due to [[recursive]] self-improvement. Since nobody knows how to predict beforehand when [[superintelligence]] will arrive, such observers call for research into [[friendly artificial intelligence]] as a possible way to mitigate [[existential risk from artificial general intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Artificial Intelligence a Threat?|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Is-Artificial-Intelligence-a/148763|accessdate=25 November 2017|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied theology at the [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|University of Tübingen]] and was appointed parish priest of Buhl near Rottenburg in 1853, where he died in 1897. His principal work is the continuation of Count [[Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg-Stolberg|Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg]]'s ''History of the Religion of Jesus Christ'', of which he wrote volumes forty-five to fifty-four, bringing the history up to 1245 CE. His share of the work does not reach the high standard of his great predecessor. He is also the author of a work in two volumes on the controversies between [[Paolo Sarpi]] and [[Pallavicini]], and of a monograph on [[Pope Innocent III]]. His ''Catholic Pulpit Orators of Germany'' in five volumes was published in Schaffhausen in the years 1866-71. He contributed many articles to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]'s ''Kirchenlexicon''.

'''John Kirakosyan''' ({{lang-hy|Ջոն Կիրակոսյան}}; May 6, 1929 – June 20, 1985) was a [[Soviet Armenia|Soviet Armenian]] historian and political scientist. He was a Doctor of Historical Sciences and a Professor at [[Yerevan State University]], where he headed the Faculty of Oriental Studies.

== Biography ==
Kirakosyan was born in Yerevan, the capital of Soviet Armenia, in 1929. From 1955 till 1962, he contributed to the periodical of the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]], "Leninyan Ughiov". From 1962 till 1966 he was head of the propaganda division of the party's Central Committee, and from 1966 till 1969 he served as chairman of the state committee of the [[Armenian SSR]] on television and radiobroadcasting. From 1969 till 1975 he was head of the science and education division of the party, and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Armenian SSR from 1975 until his death in 1985.

Amongst his scientific works are numerous research papers and several lengthy treatises that constitute a major contribution to the understanding of key aspects of Armenian history.

In 1954 Kirakosyan successfully defended his thesis at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the [[USSR]] Academy of Sciences, which was dedicated to the subject of British intervention in Iran in 1919-1921. In 1957 his work "A heroic page in the national liberation struggle of the Indian people" appeared in print, in which he focused on one of the most important events of India's national liberation struggle - the [[Sepoy Mutiny]], which the Armenian community of India also took part in.

Beginning in the 1960s, Kirakosyan conducted in-depth research into the most complex and tragic events in the history of Western Armenia, uncovering little-known and poorly studied aspects of the [[Armenian Question]]. This would be a passion of his for the rest of his life.

In 1965 Kirakosyan's major work "The First World War and the Western Armenians" was published. The book was published a total of three times (in 1965 and 1967 in Armenian, and in 1971 in Russian). In 1972 his work "Armenia in the documents of international diplomacy and Soviet foreign policy" appeared in print. His final major work was the two-volume monograph "The Young Turks before the law court of history" (1982 and 1983). For these major works the author was awarded a State Prize of the Armenian SSR.

In his treatise "The Young Turks before the law court of history", Kirakosyan set out to uncover the political essence of the Young Turks and the hollowness of their slogan "liberty, equality and justice", and to reveal the historical truths about the tragedy that befell the Armenians in Turkey, whose murder and deportation in 1915 provoked the censure of the world. Through a comparative analysis of an enormous quantity of multilingual and diverse sources and a thorough study of newly unearthed sources, Kirakosyan showed how contemporary Turkish historians were acting as attorneys covering up the monstrous crimes of [[Sultan]] [[Abdul-Hamid II]] and the [[Young Turks]]. He also put forth his belief that the genocidal campaign against the Armenians was aimed not only at their physical destruction but was directed against Russia as well, the country which was the main obstacle on the way to realizing the goals of pan-Turkism. The apex of the Young Turks' many atrocities was the extirpation during World War I of more than a million Armenians, a crime against humanity that would come to be known as the [[Armenian Genocide]].

In reference to Turkish historians subverting history for political ends, Kirakosyan noted that "with a calm conscience they sacrifice truth and the principles of scientific objectivity and serve falsification and lies".

Professor Kirakosyan was one of the most widely read and respected of Armenian historians. He dedicated his outstanding talent as a political scientist to the assertion of historical truth and scientific objectivity and to the fight against the whitewashing of history. Monographs and numerous scientific articles of his enjoy a wide popularity not only in Armenia, but also in Russia and the West.

Kirakosyan also made significant contributions to the development of relations between Diasporan Armenian communities and Soviet Armenia. As an expert in Armenian history and identity, he paid considerable attention in his writings to the Diaspora's struggle to maintain its ethnic and cultural identity.

John Kirakosyan was an active member of the main editorial staff of the [[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]].

==Change of era==
* '''1652''' {{nihongo|''Jōō gannen''|承応元年}}: The era name was changed to ''Jōō'' (meaning "receiving answers"), which was to mark the death of the third ''[[shōgun]]'', [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]]. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in ''Keian'' 5, on the 18th day of the 9th month.

The name of this new era came from the Book of the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]]:  "The [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]] and the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] dynasties follow their destinies, so the House of [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] came when it was time." (夏商'''承'''運、周氏'''応'''期)

==Events of the ''Jōō'' era==
* '''October 3, 1653''' (''Jōō 2, 12th day of the 8th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 承応二年八月十二日  --&gt;: A violent fire destroyed a large part of the Imperial palace and many temples which were nearby. Shortly thereafter, several girls, aged 12–14 years, were imprisoned for having started this fire and others in [[Heian-kyō]].&lt;ref name="t412"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cg8oAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=editions:OCLC63259938#PRA1-PA412,M1  p. 412.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''August 18, 1654''' (''Jōō 3, 6th day of the 7th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 承応三年七月六日 --&gt;: A famous priest, [[Ingen]], arrived at Nagasaki from China. His intention was to reform the practice of Buddhism in Japan.&lt;ref name="t412"/&gt;
* '''October 30, 1654''' (''Jōō 3, 20th day of the 9th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 承応三年九月二十日 --&gt;: [[Emperor Go-Kōmyō]] died of smallpox; and his funeral ceremonies were at {{nihongo|[[Sennyū-ji]]|泉涌寺,| senyō-ji''}} on the 15th day of the 10th month.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cg8oAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=editions:OCLC63259938#PRA1-PA413,M1   p. 413;] Porter, Robert. (2001). ''Japan: The Rise of a Modern Power'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sakoku: Before and after 1653==
Within the Jōō period, Japan was implementing the [[Sakoku]] policy which adopted by Tokugawa Bakumatsu.  ''Sakoku'' (鎖国) means closed country in Japanese. Japan was adopting this policy from 1639 to 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Itoh|first=Mayumi|title=Japan's abiding sakoku mentality|journal=Orbis|date=March 1996|pages=pg. 235–245|doi=10.1016/S0030-4387(96)90062-9}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There was barely any foreign trade from other countries, with exception to Chinese and Dutch merchant. Japanese residences were strictly monitored by the Government. People were not allowed to leave the country, with consequence of death penalty. Foreigners were in the same situation, anyone who attempted to enter Japan’s territory would be killed by the soldiers right away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unknown|title=Sakoku Policy|url=http://aer2.sbc.edu.hk/~wcc/Japan/sakoku.doc|publisher=St. Bonaventure College|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire country was dictated by Tokugawa government. The Sakoku policy was adopted by the ruler for preventing invaders, and keeping their national characteristics and national religion. This policy was banned after the Edo Period (1603–1868). The country was re-opened to the world in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Itoh|first=Mayumi|title=Japan's abiding sakoku mentality|journal=Orbis|date=March 1996|pages=pg. 235–245|doi=10.1016/S0030-4387(96)90062-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ken Adachi''' (1929 – February 9, 1989) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] writer and literary critic, who was associated with the ''[[Toronto Star]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s literary section from 1976 until his death.

Born to [[Japan]]ese immigrants in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Adachi was [[Japanese Canadian internment|interned]] with his family at [[Slocan, British Columbia|Slocan]] during [[World War II]]. Following the end of the war, Adachi became editor of the ''[[New Canadian]]'', a Japanese Canadian newspaper formerly edited by [[Tommy Shoyama]], and studied [[English literature]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. He subsequently taught at the University of Toronto from 1958 to 1971, and at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] from 1964 to 1968.

He then joined the ''Toronto Star'' in 1972 as a copy editor, rising to become editor of the books section in 1976. That same year, he also published the book ''The Enemy That Never Was'', a history of the Japanese Canadian community which was later hailed by [[Robert Fulford (journalist)|Robert Fulford]] as the definitive book on Japanese history in Canada.

Adachi was fired from his position with the ''Star'' in 1981 after a [[plagiarism]] accusation, although he was soon rehired as a book reviewer and literary columnist.  He remained associated with the ''Star'' until 1989, when he committed [[suicide]] after a second accusation that he had plagiarized three paragraphs from a 1982 book review in ''[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Procopio |first=Sarah |last2=Butler|first2=Caroline|date=April 1, 1990 |title=Tuned In, Turned Off and Burned Out |url=http://rrj.ca/tuned-in-turned-off-and-burned-out/ |dead-url= |magazine=Ryerson Review of Journalism |location=Toronto |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=April 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His widow, [[Mary Adachi]], remains active in Canadian literature as a book editor.

The '''knowledge economy''' is the '''use of knowledge''' (savoir, [[List of French expressions in English#S|savoir-faire]], savoir-être) to generate tangible and intangible values&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2010. Roads to perdition in the knowledge economy. Environment and Planning A 42(7), pp.1519-1520. https://doi.org/10.1068/a4324

The term was popularized by [[Peter Drucker]] as the title of Chapter 12 in his book ''[[The Age of Discontinuity]]'' (1969), that Drucker attributed to economist [[Fritz Machlup]], originating in the idea of "[[scientific management]]" developed by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Drucker |year=1969 |title=The Age of Discontinuity; Guidelines to Our Changing Society |publisher=Harper and Row |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==
A key concept of the knowledge economy is that knowledge and education (often referred to as "[[human capital]]") can be treated as one of the following two:

* A business product, as educational and innovative intellectual products and services can be exported for a high value return.
* A productive asset.

It can be defined as:

{{quote|text=[P]roduction and services based on knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to an accelerated pace of technical and scientific advance, as well as rapid obsolescence. The key component of a knowledge economy is a greater reliance on intellectual capabilities than on physical inputs or natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Powell |first1=Walter W. |last2=Snellman |first2=Kaisa |date=2004 |title=The Knowledge Economy |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/song/papers/powell_snellman.pdf |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |publisher=Annual Reviews |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100037 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The initial foundation for the knowledge economy was introduced in 1966 in the book ''The Effective Executive'' by Peter Drucker. In this book, Drucker described the difference between the manual worker (page 2) and the [[knowledge worker]]. The manual worker, according to him, works with their hands and produces goods or services. In contrast, a knowledge worker (page 3) works with their head, not hands, and produces ideas, knowledge, and information.

The key problem in the [[formal system|formalization]] and [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] of knowledge economy is a vague definition of [[knowledge|''knowledge'']], which is a rather relative concept. For example, it is not proper to consider ''[[information society]]'' as interchangeable with ''[[knowledge society]]''. ''[[Information]]'' is usually not equivalent to ''knowledge''. Their use depends on individual and group ''[[preferences]]'' (see the cognitive IPK model) which are "economy-dependent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Terry |last=Flew |year=2008 |title=New Media: An Introduction |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-19-555149-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The knowledge economy is also seen as the latest stage of development in global [[economic restructuring]]. Thus far, the developed world has transitioned from an agricultural economy (pre-Industrial Age, largely the [[agrarian sector]]) to [[industrial economy]] (with the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]], largely the [[manufacturing sector]]) to [[post-industrial]]/[[mass production]] economy (mid-1900s, largely the [[service sector]]) to knowledge economy (late 1900s – 2000s, largely the [[technology]]/[[human capital]] sector). This latest stage has been marked by the upheavals in technological innovations and the globally competitive need for [[innovation]] with new products and processes that develop from the research community (i.e., R&amp;D factors, universities, labs, educational institutes).

In the knowledge economy, the specialized labor force is characterized as computer literate and well-trained in handling data, developing algorithms and simulated models, and innovating on processes and systems. Harvard Business School Professor, [[Michael Porter]], asserts that today’s economy is far more dynamic and that [[comparative advantage]] is less relevant than [[competitive advantage]] which rests on “making more productive use of inputs, which requires continual [[innovation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael E. |last=Porter |title=Clusters and the New Economics of Competition |journal=[[Harvard Business Review]] |year=1998 |volume=December |issue= |pages=77–90 |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1188431.files/Class%2010%20Mar%205/GSD5421%20Porter%20New%20Economics%20of%20Competition%201998.pdf }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the technical [[STEM fields|STEM]] careers including computer scientists, engineers, chemists, biologists, mathematicians, and scientific inventors will see continuous demand in years to come. Additionally, well-situated clusters, which Michael Porter argues is vital in global economies, connect locally with linked industries, manufacturers, and other entities that are related by skills, technologies, and other common inputs. Hence, knowledge is the catalyst and connective tissue in modern economies.

With Earth’s depleting natural resources, the need for green infrastructure, a logistics industry forced into [[Just in time (business)|just-in-time]] deliveries, growing global demand, regulatory policy governed by performance results, and a host of other items high priority is put on knowledge; and research becomes paramount. Knowledge provides the technical expertise, problem-solving, performance measurement and evaluation, and data management needed for the trans-boundary, interdisciplinary global scale of today’s competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=The Brookings Institution |title=MetroPolicy: Shaping A New Federal Partnership for a Metropolitan Nation Report |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide examples of the knowledge economy taking place among many others include: [[Silicon Valley]] in California; aerospace and automotive engineering in [[Munich]], Germany; biotechnology in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], India; electronics and digital media in [[Seoul]], South Korea; [[petrochemical]] and energy industry in Brazil. Many other cities and regions try to follow a knowledge-driven development paradigm and increase their knowledge base by investing in higher education and research institutions in order to attract high skilled labor and better position themselves in the global competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koukoufikis|first1=Giorgos|title=Building a knowledge-driven city The case of the Gran Sasso Science Institute in L ’Aquila, Italy|url=https://www.academia.edu/22442110/Building_a_knowledge-driven_city_The_case_of_the_Gran_Sasso_Science_Institute_in_L_Aquila_Italy|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, despite digital tools democratizing access to knowledge, research shows that knowledge economy activities remain as concentrated as ever in traditional economic cores&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ojanperä|first=Sanna|last2=Graham|first2=Mark|last3=Straumann|first3=Ralph|last4=Sabbata|first4=Stefano De|last5=Zook|first5=Matthew|date=2017-03-08|title=Engagement in the Knowledge Economy: Regional Patterns of Content Creation with a Focus on Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://itidjournal.org/index.php/itid/article/view/1479|journal=Information Technologies &amp; International Development|language=en|volume=13|issue=0|pages=19|issn=1544-7529}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

It has been suggested that the next evolutionary step after knowledge economy is the [[network economy]], where the relatively localized knowledge is now being shared among and across various networks for the benefit of the network members as a whole, to gain economic of scale in a wider, more open scale. It has been hypothesized that the gradual evolution of network economy would create a well interconnected economic order, which would then begin to concentrate on the passion of individuals, gradually leading to a [[Passion based economy]].

==Driving forces==
Commentators{{Who|date=July 2014}} suggest there are various interlocking driving forces, which are changing the rules of business and national competitiveness:

* [[Globalization]] — markets and products are more global.
* [[Information technology]], which is related to next three:
** [[Information]]/[[Knowledge]] Intensity — efficient production relies on information and [[trade secret|know-how]]; many factory workers use their heads more than their hands.
** [[New Media]] – New media increases the production and distribution of knowledge which in turn, results in [[collective intelligence]]. Existing knowledge becomes much easier to access as a result of networked data-bases which promote online interaction between users and producers.
** [[Computer networking]] and Connectivity{{spaced ndash}}developments such as the [[Internet]] bring the "[[global village (Internet)|global village]]" ever nearer.

As a result, goods and services can be developed, bought, sold, and in many cases even delivered over electronic networks.

As regards the applications of any new technology, this depends on how it meets economic demand. It can remain dormant or make a commercial breakthrough (see [[diffusion of innovation]]).

==Characteristics==
It can be argued that the knowledge economy differs from the traditional economy in several key respects:

* The economics are not of scarcity, but rather of abundance. Unlike most resources that  are depleted when used, information and [[knowledge sharing|knowledge can be shared]], and actually grow through application.
* The effect of location is either
**diminished, in some economic activities: using appropriate technology and methods, virtual [[marketplace]]s and [[virtual organization]]s that offer benefits of speed, agility, round the clock operation and global reach can be created.
**or, on the contrary, reinforced in some other economic fields, by the creation of [[business cluster]]s around centers of knowledge, such as universities and research centers. However, clusters already existed in pre-knowledge economy times.
* Laws, barriers, taxes and ways to measure are difficult to apply solely on a national basis. Knowledge and information "leak" to where demand is highest and the barriers are lowest.
* Knowledge enhanced products or services can command price premiums over comparable products with low embedded knowledge or knowledge intensity.
* [[Pricing]] and value depends heavily on context. Thus the same information or knowledge can have vastly different value to different people, or even to the same person at different times.
* Knowledge when locked into systems or processes has higher inherent value than when it can "walk out of the door" in people's heads.
* [[Human capital]] — competencies — are a key component of value in a knowledge-based company, yet few companies report competency levels in annual reports. In contrast, downsizing is often seen as a positive "cost cutting" measure.
* [[Communication]] is increasingly being seen as fundamental to [[knowledge flow]]s. Social structures, cultural context and other factors influencing social relations are therefore of fundamental importance to knowledge economies.

These characteristics require new ideas and approaches from policy makers, managers and knowledge workers.

The knowledge economy has manifold forms in which it may appear but there are predictions that the new economy will extend  radically, creating a pattern in which even ideas will be recognised and identified as a [[commodity]].

==Technology==
The technology requirements for an [[National innovation system|Innovative System]] as described by the [[World Bank Institute]] must be able to disseminate a [[unified process]] by which a working method may converge scientific and technology solutions, and organizational solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Tho, Q.T.; Hui, S.C.; Fong, A.C.M.; Tru Hoang Cao |journal=IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering |title=Automatic Fuzzy Ontology Generation for Semantic Web |volume=18 |issue=6 |year=2006 |pages=842–856 |doi=10.1109/TKDE.2006.87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the World Bank Institute‘s definition, such [[innovation]] would further enable the World Bank Institute‘s vision outlined in their [[Millennium Development Goals]].

===Challenges for developing countries===
The United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development report (UNCSTD, 1997) concluded that for developing countries to successfully integrate [[Information and communication technologies for development|ICTs]] and sustainable development in order to participate in the knowledge economy they need to intervene collectively and strategically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=UNCSTD |year=1997 |title=United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development |work=Report of the Working Group on ICTs for Development prepared for the 3rd Session |location=12 May, Geneva, Switzerland }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such collective intervention suggested would be in the development of effective national ICT policies that support the new regulatory framework, promote the selected [[knowledge production]], and use of ICTs and harness their organizational changes to be in line with the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The report further suggests that developing countries to develop the required ICT strategies and policies for institutions and regulations taking into account the need to be responsive to the issues of convergence.

'''Lajos Thallóczy''', (Also, ''Ludwig von Thallóczy'', ''Ljudevit Taloci'', born '''Ludwig Strommer''') (8 December 1857 &amp;ndash; 1 December 1916) was a Hungarian historian, archivist and high public servant. He was a mysterious person of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy who played a very significant role in the Balkans. Because of his mentors [[Gyula Andrássy]] and especially [[Béni Kállay]] he became an inevitable counselor in all Balkan affairs even to the emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] himself, to ministers and to the government of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tibor |2009|p=217}}{{quote|......u mnogočemu zagonetna ličnost monarhije ... igra isto tako zna čajnu ulogu kao i u naučnom životu. Pomoću svojih 'mentora' grofa Đule Andrašija starijeg, a posebno Benjamina Kalaja, postao je nezaobilazni savetnik u balkanskim odnosima i samom vladaru Franji Josifu, zajedničkim ministrima i Vladi Mađarske.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

== Biography ==
=== Bosnia ===
[[File:Coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1889–1918).svg|thumb|left|160px|Coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina ordered in 1889 based on Thallóczy's proposal]]

Thallóczy became interested in [[heraldry]] in a period when scientific circles became interested to select the "right" coat of arms for Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filipović|2010|p=174}}{{quote|izvjestan broj radova posvjetio je problematici bosanske heraldike. Njegov se interes za tu temu javio kada su se širi naučni krugovi počeli intenzivnije baviti analizom heraldičkih izvora i to sve u svrhu rješavanja pitanja odabira "pravog" zemaljskog grba za Bosnu i Hercegovinu.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main interests were [[History of Bosnia|Bosnian history]], especially genealogy, heraldry and biographies of prominent individuals from its medieval period. Supported by Thallóczy's selective use of tendentiously interpreted sources aimed to satisfy the political aspirations of the empire by representing a historically connected fate of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Austria-Hungary the government imposed his proposal for the official [[coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filipović|2010|p=175}}{{quote|Svojim selektivnim pristupom raspoloživim izvorima kao i njihovom tendencioznom interpretacijom Thalloczy je ponudio ideju blisku ugarskoj državnoj tradiciji i političkim aspiracijama....

Thallóczy was transferred to Vienna at the request of [[Béni Kállay]]. He was in charge of cultural and educational issues in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He published numerous Cyrillic and Latin charters, and also works about the duke [[Hrvoje Vukčić]], history of [[Jajce]] and numerous other, Bosnia-related, subjects, with the main findings published in the book ''Studien zur Geschichte Bosniens und Serbiens im Mittelalter'', published in Munich and Leipzig in the year 1914.

=== Albania ===
Before the [[First World War]] Austria-Hungary was significantly interested in [[Albania (Balkans)|Albania]] because of the political and military plans it had on Balkans and sent its scholars to investigate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2012|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly because of this interest Thallóczy was employed within [[Austria-Hungary]] administration with title of court counselor to create one work on popular history of Albanians and one textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2012|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Stvaranje Jugoslavije 1790-1918 | publisher=Prosveta | author=Ekmečić, Milorad | authorlink=Milorad Ekmečić | year=1989 | volume=2 | page=453 | quote=Историчар Талоци, ангажован у управи са титулом дворског саветника, преузео је на себе да изради једну попу- ларну историју Албанаца и једну читанку.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Milan Šufflay]] and [[Konstantin Jireček]] he wrote two volumes of his monumental work 	
''Acta et diplomata res Albaniae mediae aetatis illustrantia'' ({{lang-en|Documents and Diplomatic Affairs illustrating the Middle Ages in Albania}}) published in 1913 and 1918. Serbian historian [[Milorad Ekmečić]] credits him with having designed the 14th-century [[Flag of Albania|flag]] and [[coat of arms of Albania]] (the black [[double-headed eagle]] on a red banner).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ekmečić |first=Milorad |authorlink=Milorad Ekmečić |title=Response to Noel Malcom's book Kosovo, a short history : scientific discussion on Noel Malcolm's book "Kosovo, a short history" (Macmillan, London 1998, 492), 8th October 1999 |trans-title=|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/response-to-noel-malcoms-book-kosovo-a-short-history-scientific-discussion-on-noel-malcolms-book-kosovo-a-short-history-macmillan-london-1998-492-8th-october-1999/oclc/48938551&amp;referer=brief_results |volume=18 |year=2000 |publisher=Institut of History of the Serbian Academy of Sciences |location=Belgrade |language= |isbn=9788677430207 |oclc=48938551 |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page= |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter=Historiography by the Garb Only |chapterurl=http://www.rastko.rs/kosovo/istorija/malkolm/mekmecic-garb.html |quote=He organized the design of the national insignia, such as the coat of arms and the flag.

While some circles in [[Italy]] had plans to establish closer connection of [[Montenegro]] and Northern Albanian Catholics under their leadership, Thallóczy was one of the promoters of the plans of Austria-Hungary for strengthening the otherness between them and confronting Albanians and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. The aim was to counter advances of Serbia and Montenegro on [[Adriatic coast]]. In December 1897 Thallóczy stated that it is necessary to take actions to prevent population of Albania being attracted to Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Clayer | first = Nathalie | title =Aux origines du nationalisme albanais: la naissance d'une nation| publisher = Karthala |page=528|quote=Certains milieux italiens continuaient à envisager un rapprochement entre le Monténégro orthodoxe et le Nord albanais catholique, sous leur propre houlette. En revanche, l' Autriche-Hongrie, qui cherchait à contrer l'avancée serbe et monténégrine en direction de l'Adriatique, avait tout intérêt à renforcer les altérités « albanais &gt;&gt; versus « slave &gt;&gt; et « catholique &gt;&gt; versus « orthodoxe &gt;&gt;. En décembre 1897, l'un des promoteurs du nouveau plan d'action austro-hongrois en Albanie, Ludwig von Thalloczy, affirmait qu'il fallait agir contre l'attraction du Monténégro.

=== Serbia ===
During World War I he was civil counselor of the military administration in occupied [[Kingdom of Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filipović|2010|p=175}}{{quote|Na inicijativu Benjamina Kallaya, ministra financija, premješten je u Beč gdje postaje državni savjetnik i direktor arhiva zajedničkog ministarstva financija.

{{Cnote2|A|In almost all encyclopedias and works on Thallóczy is written that he was born in [[Buda]] in 1854 which was his official year of birth until his death.

'''Majbritt Morrison''' (born 1933) is known for being the victim of an [[Assault#England and Wales|assault]] that sparked off the [[1958 Notting Hill race riots]]&lt;ref&gt;WISC [http://www.wisc.btck.co.uk/TheArtofRacism The Art of Racism, WISC'S Impact on the Socio-economic Changes]&lt;/ref&gt; which escalated from there,&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Erik Petersen, ''STIEG'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=x3kpQ-otsxoC&amp;pg=PT89&amp;lpg=PT89&amp;dq=Majbritt+Morrison+Sweden+West+Indian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nPw97FajSx&amp;sig=6WAJiMAvI5M8RazcOiFi_EWJ_X8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=luaNUfexJ66RigeNyoHIAQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBg Quercus Publishing, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; and as the author of the best seller ''[[Jungle West 11]]''.

==Background==
She was born in [[Sweden]].  In 1955, as a 22-year-old student, she went to the UK. There she met and fell in love with Raymond Morrison, a Jamaican painter, and married him.&lt;ref&gt;Good Reads: [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/909315Jungle_West_11 ''Jungle West 11'' by Majbritt Morrison.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
The night before the Notting Hill race riots, she was outside [[Latimer Road tube station]], arguing with her husband. The following day on Saturday, 30 August 1958,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=15764 "The Notting Hill riot and a carnival of defiance"], ''Socialist Worker'', Issue No. 2115, 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; while leaving a blues dance,&lt;ref name=Vaguerants&gt;Vaguerants site: [http://www.vaguerants.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/timelinechap7.pdf "Notting Hill History Timeline: 7 The Clash 1958, Saturday August 30.]&lt;/ref&gt; she was seen by a gang of white youths the following day who remembered her. They followed her, throwing milk bottles and hurling racist abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/aug/17/nottinghillcarnival2002.nottinghillcarnival Gary Younge, "The politics of partying"], ''The Guardian'', 17 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the slurs that was thrown at her was "Black man's trollop". She was also hit in the back with an iron bar and somebody from the mob called out: "Kill her!"&lt;ref name=Vaguerants /&gt;

While standing her ground, she was ordered by the police to go inside. She refused, and she was arrested. Meanwhile, the mob carried on down the road, smashing windows and would have attacked a house party that was organized by [[Count Suckle]] who was one of the first sound system operators in Great Britain. Count Suckle and his friends were escorted out of the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rivUx1yS4wMC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=Majbritt+Morrison+Swedish&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O_2vxYMtmd&amp;sig=tuNk4bHBwKoDU45mPEhbNYPoVsY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MhFyUYiTFIWSiAenq4CICQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Majbritt%20Morrison%20Swedish&amp;f=false Ashley Dawson, ''Mongrel Nation: Diasporic Culture And the Making of Postcolonial Britain''], University of Michigan, 2007, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the riots==
On 1 September 1958, having been charged with obstruction during the riots, Majbritt Morrison was photographed along with her husband  leaving the [[West London Police Court]]. She was scheduled to have a hearing at the Tower Hill Court a few days from then.&lt;ref&gt;Getty Images: [http://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/news-photo/maj-britt-morrison-leaves-the-west-london-police-court-with-news-photo/73858502 "Mixed Race Couple", 1 September 1958.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later in the 1970s, Raymond Morrison worked in the music business and released a few reggae singles on the [[Hawk Records]] label as Ray Morrison or with a friend, Tamara, performing as Ram and Tam.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Ram-Tam-Will-You-Still-Love-Me-Tomorrow/release/2772976 Ram &amp; Tam – Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow.]&lt;/ref&gt; He also managed a club in Swiss Cottage during the 1970s.

==Released work==
Her book ''[[Jungle West 11]]'' was first published in the UK by [[Tandem Books]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Worldcat: [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jungle-west-11/oclc/30266895&amp;referer=brief_results ''Jungle West 11''.]&lt;/ref&gt; This was her account of the events relating to the Notting Hill Riots.

'''Mikhail Petrovich Barataev''' ({{lang-ru|Михаил Петрович Баратаев (Бараташвили)}}, {{lang-ka|მიხეილ ბარათაევი [ბარათაშვილი]}}) (January 1, 1784 – July 30, 1856) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] bureaucrat of [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] origin and an amateur [[numismatist]], the first to have studied the coinage of Georgia.

Barataev was born in Simbirsk (now [[Ulyanovsk]]) into the expatriate Georgian noble family of [[Baratashvili]]. His father, Prince Pyotr Mikhailovich Barataev (1734-1789), was a general in the Russian army and Simbirsk governor. His mother came of the Russian untitled noble family of Nazimov. He served as an artillery officer from 1798 to 1809 and retired with wounds received in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. From 1820 to 1835, Barataev was a head of nobility of the Simbirsk governorate. He founded a [[Freemasonry|Freemasonic]] lodge "Key to Virtues" (Ключ к добродетели) in Simbirsk and was briefly arrested in 1826 for his ties with the [[Decembrist]]s.

In 1839, Barataev was appointed a director of the customs department in Georgia. During his tenure in the [[Caucasus]], Barataev became interested in numismatics and collected a unique collection of Georgian coins. Upon his retirement in 1844, Barataev published, in [[French language|French]] and Russian, his principal study ''The Numismatic Facts of the Kingdom of Georgia'' (Russian: Нумизматические факты грузинского царства; French: ''Documents numismatiques du Royaume de Géorgie'') – the first scholarly treatment of the subject in question – which won him a membership of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He died at his estate Barataevka in Simbirsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.hrono.info/biograf/bio_b/barataev.html Михаил Петрович Баратаев]. ''Hrono.ru''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1539">The '''''Monitor''''' was one of the first newspapers in [[Poland]], printed from 1765 to 1785, during the [[Polish Enlightenment]]. It was founded in March 1765 by [[Ignacy Krasicki]] and [[Franciszek Bohomolec]], with active support from [[Monarchs of Poland|King]] [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]]. It came out weekly, later semi-weekly. Its title was a tribute to the [[Monitor (1763)|"small" Monitor]] published by Prince [[Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski]]. 

Inspired by the English ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'' and the spirit of [[rationalism]] and [[religious tolerance]], ''Monitor'' has contributed to a negative view of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] under the [[Wettin (dynasty)|Wettin dynasty]]. The ''Monitor'' advocated reforms and criticized a degenerate [[Sarmatism|Sarmatian]] culture and the abuses of "[[Golden Liberty]]."

The '''Museu Barbier-Mueller d'Art Precolombí''' (its local name in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; also known in {{lang-es|'''Museo Barbier-Mueller de Arte Precolombino'''}}, and in {{lang-en|'''Barbier-Mueller Pre-Columbian Art Museum'''}}) was the only [[museum]] in Europe devoted exclusively to the artistic legacy of the [[pre-Columbian]] cultures of [[the Americas]]. It was located in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] capital of [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. The museum was established in 1997 to house the [[pre-Columbian art]] collection formerly held by its parent museum, the [[Barbier-Mueller Museum]] in [[Genève]], [[Switzerland]], which was loaned to the city of Barcelona. In 2012, the museum was unable to reach a purchase agreement with the collection's owner Jean Paul Barbier-Mueller. Subsequently, the world's most important Pre-Columbian collection in private hands (according to El País) was split and auctioned at Southeby's on 22 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2012/09/14/catalunya/1347654720_583733.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">'''National patrimony''' is the store of [[wealth]] or accumulated reserves of a [[national economy]]. In addition to monetary reserves and other financial holdings, national patrimony also encompasses a nation's non-monetary wealth or reserves, such as its national monuments, cuisine, and artistic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Sophie Maisonneuve, ‘Between History and Commodity: The Production of A Musical Patrimony through the Record in the 1920-1930’, Poetics, 29 (2001), pp. 89-108; esp. 89-90, 95, 103. For an example from Ireland, see also [http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/TEP/2000_papers/TEPNo7JOH20.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== China ==
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the term "national essence" is translated as ''guocui'' 國粹, and the journal ''Guocui xuebao'' 國粹學報 (''Journal of National Essence'')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tbmc.com.tw/english_version/chinesedata/chinese_15.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 1905 with the aim of preserving and protecting [[China]]'s artistic national patrimony. This journal originally was divided into seven sections, four of which are topical in nature and represent specific aspects of what might be considered China's "national essence" and, by extension, national patrimony:
* Politics (''zhengpian'' 政篇)
* History (''shipian'' 史篇)
* Teaching and learning (''xuepian'' 學篇, or more literally "approaches to study")
* Literature (''wenpian'' 文篇)

Two years after the journal's initial publication, two additional topical sections were added:
* Art (''Meishu'' 美術)
* Natural Science (''Bowu'' 博物, literally, "knowledge about things")

== Japan&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Pyle, ''The New Generation in Meiji Japan'', 1885-1895 (Stanford, 1969), pp. 4, 52-71.&lt;/ref&gt; ==
In Japanese, the term "national essence" is translated as ''kokusui'', and the term ''kokusui hozon'' 國粹保存 is translated as "preserving the national essence."

In response to increasing Western influence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a growing sense [[Japanese nationalism]] led in 1889 to the establishment of three institutions aimed at protecting and preserving artistic aspects of the country's national patrimony:
* The Imperial Museum (''Teikoku Hakubutsukan'' 帝國博物館)
* The Tokyo School of Fine Arts (''Tōkyō Bijutsu Gakkō'' 東京美術學校), and
* The art journal ''Kokka'' 國華

'''Mevlânâ Mehmed Neşri''' (c. 1450 – d. 1520), also commonly referred to as '''Neshri''' ({{lang-ota|نشرى}}) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] historian, a prominent representative of the early Ottoman historiography.{{sfn|Isom-Verhaaren|Schull|2016|page=66}}

Very little is known about Neshri, which suggests that he wasn't a major literary figure during his lifetime.{{sfn|Isom-Verhaaren|Schull|2016|page=66}} Then contemporary sources refer to him with the modest title of muderris (teacher), which further suggested that he did not hold a high office.{{sfn|Isom-Verhaaren|Schull|2016|page=66}} He is known as author of the universal history "Cosmorama" or "Cihan-Nümâ". Only the sixth and final parts of this work are preserved today. He probably completed it at the end of the 1480s or beginning of the 1490s by assembling many different sources, both of known and unknown authors.

He witnessed the death of [[Mehmed II]] in 1481 and the [[Janissary]] riots that followed it. Some parts of his text were based on the work of [[Ashik Pasha-Zade]], another representative of early Ottoman historiography.

'''Nicholas J. Cull''' (born 1964) is a historian and the director of the Master's in [[Public Diplomacy]] program at the [[Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism]] at the [[University of Southern California]].

==Career==
Cull earned both his [[B.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Leeds]]. As a graduate, he studied at [[Princeton University]] as a [[Harkness Fellow]] of the [[Commonwealth Fund]] of New York. From 1992 to 1997, he was Lecturer in [[American History]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], and from 1997 to 2005, chair in [[American Studies]] and Director of the Centre for American Studies at the [[University of Leicester]].

Cull's research and teaching interests are broad and inter-disciplinary, and focus on  [[public diplomacy]], the role of [[advocacy]], culture, exchange, broadcasting, and public opinion research in [[foreign policy]]. Cull has also worked more broadly on the [[history of propaganda]], [[History of film|film]], [[History of television|television]] and [[radio history]] and the role of [[mass media]] as a source for historical study. He is best known for detailed historical studies of the institutions behind public diplomacy and for emphasizing the importance of "listening" as a pre-condition for successful public diplomacy.

Cull is the president of the [[International Association for Media and History]], and has worked closely with the [[British Council]]'s Counterpoint Think Tank. He is also a member of the [[Public Diplomacy Council]] and a Fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]]. In April 2008, Cull's University of Southern California program was a co-winner of the [[Benjamin Franklin Award for Public Diplomacy]], awarded by the [[U.S. Department of State]]. In January 2012, he succeeded [[Simon Anholt]] as editor of the ''[[Journal of Place Branding and Public Diplomacy]]'' (published by [[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]]).

==Publications==
Both Cull's first book, ''Selling War'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 1995), and ''The Cold War and the [[United States Information Agency]]: American Propaganda and Public Diplomacy, 1945&amp;ndash;1989'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2008) were recognized by ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]'' as outstanding academic publications of the year.

Cull is the co-editor of ''Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, 1500&amp;ndash;present'' (2003), which was one of ''[[Book List]]'' magazine's official reference books of the year, and ''Alambrista and the U.S.-Mexico Border: Film, Music, and Stories of Undocumented Immigrants'' (2004; with [[David L. Carrasco]]).

With [[James Chapman (media historian)|James Chapman]], he has co-authored ''Projecting Empire: Imperialism and Popular Cinema'' ([[I.B. Tauris]], 2009) and ''Projecting Tomorrow: Science Fiction and Popular Cinema'' (I.B. Tauris, 2013). His most recent single authored work is ''The Decline and Fall of the United States Information Agency: American Public Diplomacy, 1989&amp;ndash;2001'' ([[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]], 2012).

'''Otto Dov Kulka''' (''Ôttô Dov Qûlqā''; born April 16, 1933 in [[Nový Hrozenkov]], [[Czechoslovakia]]) is an [[Israel]]i [[historian]], [[professor emeritus]] of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. His primary areas of specialization are the study of modern [[antisemitism]] from the early modern age until its manifestation under the National-Socialist regime as the "[[Final Solution]]"; Jewish thought in Europe – and Jews in European thought – from the sixteenth to the twentieth century; Jewish-Christian relations in modern Europe; the history of the Jews in Germany; and the study of the Holocaust.

==Biography==

==Research Studies==

===Modern Antisemitism===
From the outset of his academic activity, Kulka developed a conceptual and methodological approach to the study of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust which departed from the prevailing one-dimensional focus on the persecution and annihilation of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Dov Kulka, "Major Trends and Tendencies in German Historiography on National Socialism and the 'Jewish Question'", in: [[Israel Gutman]] (ed.), ''The Historiography of the Holocaust Period'', Yad Vashem, Jerusalem 1988, pp. 1-51, 99-104.&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that the study of the history of the Jews under Nazism should follow the same scholarly principles that are applied to every historical period. Within this framework, he discerned three major topics of research: (1) Nazi ideology and policy on the Jews; (2) the attitude of the German population toward the regime's policy on the Jews and toward the Jews themselves; and (3) the Jewish society and its leadership. This comprehensive picture was then examined in the light of historical continuity and change. Only from this perspective, Kulka argued, could the question of the Nazi period's singularity and the "Final Solution" be properly addressed.

In line with this conception, Kulka made an effort to avoid  using the terms "Shoah" or "Holocaust", neither of which, in his opinion, accurately encapsulates this period within the continuity of Jewish history and does not convey its singularity. Instead, he refers to "the history of the Jews under the National-Socialist regime," and, more frequently, to the "Final Solution." The first phrase derives from his methodological approach, holding that this period should be studied like any other and in the context of its historical continuity, in the three dimensions mentioned above. As for  the term "Final Solution," Kulka considers it the most precise and most telling articulation of the teleological meaning of Nazi ideology and of the purpose underlying the realization of its goal: the termination of the historical existence of the Jewish people and the extermination of each individual Jew, as well as the eradication of the "Jewish spirit" ("jüdischer Geist") manifested in the European cultural heritage. It is here, that Kulka identifies the singularity of this period in Jewish and human history. As a scholar, Kulka has strictly separated the study of the historical past from his personal biography during the Second World War. As he noted in 2010, after completing the last of his major research projects to date,&lt;ref&gt;The Jews in the Secret Nazi Reports, on ''Popular Opinion in Germany 1933-1945'' (Yale Univ. Press, New Haven and London, 2010, 1064 p. )&lt;/ref&gt; he regarded his biographical past irrelevant to historical research, and intertwining the two spheres as illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;In Kulka's interview in Sunday Times, 2.2.2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in 2012, that he decided to publish a book bearing a different character. In this work, Kulka explores his memory images from the years he spent in the ghetto of Theresienstadt and in Auschwitz Birkenau, and reflects on them as a historian and thinker. First published in English in 2013 as ''Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death'', Reflections on Memory and Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;Allen Lane, Penguin Books, London 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the book has been widely translated.

===The Jews in Nazi ideology and policy===
In his research on modern antisemitism, Kulka drew, among other sources, on studies by his university teachers, the historians [[Jacob Talmon]] and Shmuel Ettinger, applying their insights to his empirical findings about National-Socialist ideology and policy. To gain a broader perspective, he examined the centrality of the ambivalent Jewish component in the major trends of Western culture in the modern age, as well as the radicalization of the elements of antagonism toward Judaism and the Jews within them. He explores these developments against the background of the secularization process of central ideological movements since the seventeenth century, the most radical of which in the twentieth century was Nazism.
In 1989, Kulka articulated his approach succinctly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many scholarly works written on National Socialism over the past three decades have reached the conclusion that antisemitism played a vital role in the ideology and policy of the Third Reich. Of all the ideological and political ingredients that went into the making of Hitler's outlook, antisemitism, in its broadest sense, appears to be not only the one consistent and immutable element, it also bridges such seemingly contradictory leanings as anti-Marxism and anti-capitalism, the struggle against democracy and modernism, and a basic anti-Christian disposition. [...] Yet Hitler consistently portrays this ideological war in the international arena as an extension of the struggle that the National Socialist movement had waged, from its inception, against its ideological and political enemies within Germany itself: Jewish Marxism, Jewish parliamentary democracy, Jewish capitalism, and even the "Political Churches" and the Jewish foundations of Christianity. In the movement's racial-determinist conception, the Jews stand in an obviously dominant relationship to all these forces and factors as the biological source of doctrines and ideologies whose most radical expression is Bolshevism but whose origin was Judaism's introduction of Christianity into the Western world. National Socialist antisemitism traced the sense of crisis that dogged the modern world to its domination by 'Jewish-Christian-Bolshevik' principles that were based on a universalist 'destructive' belief in the unity of the world and the equality of men in all spheres of life. These principles were antithetical to the Nazi Social-Darwinist version of the 'natural order', i.e., the inherent inequality of the races and the eternal struggle between them for their very survival. Hence only the restoration of this order – which was conditional upon the absolute annihilation, physical and spiritual, of Judaism – could ensure the future health, indeed the very existence of the human race.&lt;ref&gt;Critique of Judaism in European Thought: On the Historical Meaning of Modern Antisemitism, in: ''The Jerusalem Quarterly'', 52 (1989), pp. 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview for the Hebrew-language newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' in 2013 he said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;My conclusion in regard to Nazi [[antisemitism]] is that it would have been impossible without the history of traditional Jew-hatred, but that the Final Solution would have been unfeasible in a traditional Christian society. This is because the existence of Judaism was a necessity in Christianity's perception of redemption: the idea that the Jews will recover from their blindness in the last days and see the light. However, only secularization and secular political messianism made possible the totalistic 'redemptive anti-Semitism' which was inherent in Nazi ideology and its attempt to change the course of human history.&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'', April 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed, in his very first scholarly paper, "Richard Wagner and the Origins of Modern Antisemitism" (1961), Kulka identified and analyzed the phenomenon of "redemptive antisemitism." This was an ideology of political messianism, which in its various metamorphoses led ultimately to National-Socialist antisemitism and the "Final Solution."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wagner und die Anfänge des modernen Antisemitismus, in: ''Bulletin des Leo Baeck Instituts'', 16 (1961), pp. 281-300.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "redemptive antisemitism" has become, particularly since the 1990s, a reference point in research about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Friedländer, ''Nazi Germany and the Jews'', The Years of Persecution, 1933-1939, Harper Collins Publishers, New York 1997; The Years of Extermination. Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945, Harper Collins Publishers, New York 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitude of the population in Nazi Germany toward the Jews and toward the regime's anti-Jewish policy===

Kulka published a monumental documentary study on this subject, which originally appeared in German, the language of the sources, in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Otto Dov Kulka und [[Eberhard Jäckel]], ''Die Juden in den geheimen NS-Stimmungsberichten 1939-1945'', Droste Verlag, Düsseldorf 2004 (896 p. and CD-Rom with 3744 annotated documents). From the reviews: Susanne Heim, Anti-Jewish Policy and the German Volksgemeinschaft, in: ''Yad Vashem Studies'', 34 (2006), pp. 369-379; Ian Kershaw in Times Literary Supplement, 16.5.2005; Hagalil [http://buecher.hagalil.com/droste/kulka-jaeckel.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 in an expanded edition in English.&lt;ref&gt;The Jews in the Secret Nazi Reports, on ''Popular Opinion in Germany 1933-1945'', (Edited by Otto Dov Kulka and Eberhard Jäckel), Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2010 (1064 p.) From the reviews: [http://yalepress.yale.edu/reviews.asp] {{ISBN|9780300118032}};  Alan Steinweis, ''Yad Vashem Studies'', 40 (2012), pp. 173-182; David Cesarani, ''The Jewish Chronicle'', August 1, 2011 [http://www.thejc.com/arts/books/52559/the-jews-secret-nazi-reports-popular-opinion-germany-1933-1945&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Decades earlier, in the mid-1960s, Kulka was one of the pioneers of scholarly research into this subject, later collaborating with his German colleague [[Eberhard Jäckel]] and the British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]]. Kulka had laid the methodological and theoretical foundations for these studies already in his seminal article of 1975, 'Public Opinion, in ''National-Socialist Germany and the 'Jewish Question''."&lt;ref&gt;In: ''Zion'', 40 (1975), 186-290 [Hebr. with an extensive English summary and documentation in German].&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that beneath the monolithic totalitarian encasement a certain diversity of social structures and political opinions remained from the pre-Nazi period. This was also reflected in the population's consent to the regime's policy toward the Jews, in various forms of criticism of that policy, and on the other hand, in anti-Jewish violence and "pressure from below" to accelerate and radicalize the policy of the "solution of the Jewish question in Germany."&lt;ref&gt;On the "pressure from below" that preceded the promulgation of the Nuremberg laws see his article "Die Nürnberger Rassengesetze und die deutsche Bevölkerung im Lichte geheimer NS-Lage- und Stimmungsberichte", in Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte, 32 (1984), pp. 582-624. On the wave of violent anti-Jewish excesses "from below" that preceded by several weeks the so called Kristallnacht pogroms and was accompanied by destruction and burning of synagogues and expulsion of the Jews from various places in Germany, see Kulka &amp; Jäckel, The Jews in the Secret Nazi Reports, on ''Popular Opinion in Germany 1933-1945'', p. XXVI and doc. 353, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the dominant trend, as emerged clearly, was the constantly expanding and ever more extreme "removal" of the Jews from all spheres of life of the "German people's community" (Volksgemeinschaft) and finally from all of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;See also Michael Wildt, Volksgemeinschaft als Selbstermächtigung. Gewalt gegen Juden in der deutschen Provinz 1919 bis 1939, Hamburger Edition, Hamburg 2007, and Ian Kershaw, "'Volksgemeinschaft'. Potential and Limitations of the Concept." In: Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte, 1 (2011), pp. 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on these sources, Kulka devoted a special study to the complex problem of the attitude taken by the churches and the religious population in Germany toward the Jews, including those who converted to Protestantism and Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;"The Churches in the Third Reich and the 'Jewish Question' in the Light of Secret Nazi Reports on German 'Public Opinion'," in: Bibliothèque de la Revue d'Histoire Ecclésiastique, Miscellanea historiae ecclésiasticae IX, Bruxelles 1984, pp. 490-505.&lt;/ref&gt;
In another study based on the above-mentioned highly reliable source material Kulka devoted a special article to the examination of another aspect - the popular opinion in Nazi Germany and the government's attitude toward the Jews. In this study he revealed the influence of the popular opinion as "a factor in the policy of the 'solution of the Jewish question'."&lt;ref&gt;"Popular Opinion in Nazi Germany as a Factor in the Policy of the 'Solution of the Jewish Question'", in:  Paul Corner (ed.) Popular Opinion in Totalitarian Regimes: Fascism, Nazism, Communism, Oxford University Press, Oxford 2009, pp. 81-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kulka also considered it important to probe the abundant detailed information contained in these reports about the life of the Jews and their organized activity as they coped with both the regime's policy and the attitude of the German population toward them. He viewed the picture that emerged of the diverse, systematic, and continuous information that was presented to the various levels of the regime as a significant supplementary to what could be gleaned from the contemporary Jewish sources. Both types of sources show a thrust toward continuity – though organized Jewish activity is seen to undergo transformations. It became more intense as a dialectical response to the growing and consistently more acute efforts to remove the Jews from the various spheres of life of the German state and society.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Dov Kulka, "Jewish Society in Germany as Reflected in Secret Nazi Reports on 'Public Opinion' 1933-1945", in: [[Moshe Zimmerman]] (ed.), ''Germans and Jews under the Nazi Regime'', Essays by Three Generations of Historians, The Hebrew University Magnes Press, Jerusalem 2006, p. 261-279. See also subchapter here "The Jewish Society and its Leadership in Nazi Germany."&lt;/ref&gt;

The most critical question of the research concerned the German population and the "Final Solution." Prior to the publication of Kulka and Jäckel's documentation project, scholars – among them Kulka himself, Marlis Steinert, and Ian Kershaw – interpreted the reports' apparent silence regarding the Jews during the war years as reflecting the German population's indifference to the Jews' fate.&lt;ref&gt;See above endnote 11, Kulka's article in ''Zion'' 1975; Marlis Steinert, ''Hitler's War and the Germans: Public Mood and Attitude during the [[Second World War]], Athens, Ohio UP 1977; Ian Kershaw, Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich: Bavaria 1933 - 1945'', Oxford, Clarendon Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steinert and Kershaw, the German population took little interest in the Jews and their fate "because they had other things on their mind during the period of the war." At that time, Kulka viewed this apparent indifference, in the light of the reports about mass murder of Jews being perpetrated in "the east," as "abyssal indifference."

Kulka and Jäckel published nearly 4,000 reports on German public opinion and the Jews, close to 1000 of them from the war years. According to Kulka, in their light the assumption about the silence of the sources no longer meets the criterion of empirical research. The documentation also supported Kulka's earlier findings, described in his article of 1975, concerning the widespread reports that circulated among the German population about the mass annihilation of the deported Jews. In the newly found documentation from early 1942, the general consensus reported from most areas of the Third Reich was that the population wished to see all the Jews deported from Germany (in the German original: "Am meisten würde jedoch eine baldige Abschiebung aller Juden aus Deutschland begrüßt werden"). This attitude persisted despite the population's knowledge about the fate of the deported Jews, as evident from many accurate reports. Here, then, the term "abyssal indifference" takes on concrete meaning. As Kulka and Jäckel note at the closing of the Introduction to the English edition of their book: "The conclusion that can be derived from the reports on popular opinion, and from the subsequent published studies based on our edition, is a harsh one indeed."&lt;ref&gt;''The Jews in the Secret Nazi Reports'', p. LXIV and doc. 618; see also the extensive review by Bernward Dörner on: "Kulka, Otto D.; Jäckel, Eberhard (Hrsg.): Die Juden in den geheimen NS-Stimmungsberichten 1933-1945 [http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/rezensionen/2005-1-148].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Jewish society and its leadership in Nazi Germany===
This is a subject to which Kulka devoted a series of research articles as well as a book, ''German Jewry Under the National-Socialist Regime''.&lt;ref&gt;See Otto Dov Kulka (ed.): ''Deutsches Judentum unter dem Nationalsozialismus, Bd. 1: Dokumente zur Geschichte der Reichsvertretung der deutschen Juden 1933-1939'', Mohr Siebeck, Tübingen 1997; The Reichsvereinigung and the Fate of the Jews. Continuity or Discontinuity in German-Jewish History in the Third Reich," in: Arnold Paucker (Hg.), Die Juden im nationalsozialistischen Deutschland 1933-1943, J.C.B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), Tübingen 1986, pp. 353-363; "Jewish Society in Germany as Reflected in Secret Nazi Reports on 'Public Opinion' 1933-1945", in: Moshe Zimmerman (ed.), ''Germans and Jews under the Nazi Regime'', Essays by Three Generations of Historians, The Hebrew University Magnes Press, Jerusalem 2006, pp. 261-279. See also further reviews: Richard I. Cohen, "German Jews confront Nazism", in: Yad Vashem Studies XXVII (1999), pp. 461-472; Dan Michman, in: ''Zion'', 65 (2000), pp. 121-128 [Hebr.]; Alan Steinweis, Jewish Quarterly Review 90 (1999), pp. 230-234; Sabine Hillebrecht, Zeitschrift für Geschichtswissenschaft 4 (1999), pp. 369-370.&lt;/ref&gt; His research was based on his project to reconstruct the lost archives of the central Jewish organization in the years 1932-1939, the National Representation of the Jews of Germany (Reichsvertretung der deutschen Juden), and his archival discovery of its successor organization in the years 1939-1945, the  "Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Dov Kulka and Esriel Hildesheimer, "The Central Organisation of German Jews in the Third Reich and its archives (On the Completion of the Reconstruction Project)", in: '''LBIY''', 34 (1989), pp. 187-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Revising the prevailing historiography, Kulka showed that the National Representation of the Jews of Germany was not established in 1933, after the Nazis' rise to power, but that its foundations were laid a year earlier, in 1932.

In the light of the rapidly deteriorating political situation, the Jewish leadership in the various district states (Länder) realized that it was essential to create a united central organization to represent German Jewry vis-à-vis the regime. Similarly, Kulka showed that the successor to the National Representation, namely the National Association of Jews in Germany, was not established in 1939 after the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom, solely at the order of the Nazi regime. In fact, it emerged under this name, and within a new central framework as the national organization of all the Jews in Germany, in the course of a lengthy internal process in 1938.

Kulka's comprehensive article, "Germany," in the ''Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'', offers an overview of the developments among German Jewry in this period within their historical context, integrating the three areas of his research on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'', vol. 2, pp. 557-575.&lt;/ref&gt; Summing up his analysis of the status and activities of the Jewish society under the Nazi regime, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the Jews, the reaction to what was happening was different on the individual and the organizational level. Although the Jews' social and political status had suffered a tremendous blow, their existing organizational network was scarcely touched – indeed, new organizations came into being. In this respect the situation of Jews was in stark contrast to the prevailing trend of totalitarian Gleichschaltung, the purpose of which was to destroy the existing social and political fabric of German society and construct a homogeneous society (Volksgemeinschaft) in its place. It was the exclusionary racist principle on which the policy towards the Jews was based – their separation and isolation from the general society – that made possible the continuing existence of the Jew's own institutions. Moreover, "alien" and "decadent" ideas and principles such as political pluralism and democracy, which were now beyond the pale among the general population, were still the rule in Jewish public life. This was, however, the freedom of the outcasts, of a community that now seemed doomed to disappearance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Kulka, German Jewry faced three alternatives upon the establishment of the Nazi regime and the promulgation of the first anti-Jewish decrees in 1933.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first alternative was the disintegration and atomization of Jewish society and the paralysis of all its institutions and organizations under the impact of the anti-Jewish waves of terror and legislation. In the lives of individuals, this was manifested in a hasty mass flight from Germany, the desperate return of some, and in extreme cases, through suicide. The second alternative, advocated by a small minority of so-called Nationaldeutsche Juden, was diametrically opposed to the first. It was the temptation to draw the ostensibly inevitable conclusions from the crisis and failure of the democratic system of Weimar, and by the same token from the failure of the internal democratic principles of the Jewish society, and introduce in their place – for all of German Jewry – a regime of authoritarian leadership based on the Führerprinzip. However, most Jewish organizations opted for a third alternative: the continued existence of the democratic-pluralistic institutions of the Jewish society from the post-Emancipation period and the establishment of a new all-inclusive central organization based on the principle of the voluntary affiliation of each body and free activity within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;On ''Germans and Jews'', as in note 19, pp. 269-270. See also the Introduction to "Deutsches Judentum", ''Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'', vol. 2, pp. 557-575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kulka sums up his approach to the study of this period in the history of German Jewry as follows: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my attempt to present the basic tendencies in the development of Jewish life from 1933 on, there are two different dimensions of time: the historical dimension of time and the time dimension of the Third Reich – defined teleologically, the period of the Final Solution. The first dimension explores this time against the background of continuity: what existed before 1933 and continued even if under an altered guise after that watershed. The second dimension relates to what was significantly new and novel, introduced and developed under the new regime. Both dimensions must be examined side by side. Of course, the first was predominant until 1938/1939, the second from then on to 1943 or even 1945.&lt;ref&gt;On Germans and Jews, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Studies on Historiography===
A key element of Kulka's research on Nazi Germany and the [[Holocaust]] period is devoted to its historiography. The subject is addressed in several of his seminal articles. His article on the German historiography of National-Socialism and the "Jewish Question" from 1924 to 1984 was the first and most systematic on this complex topic&lt;ref&gt;Die deutsche Geschichtsschreibung über Nationalsozialismus und die 'Endlösung'", in: ''Historische Zeitschrift'', 240 (1985), pp. 599-639; (extended English version: "Major Trends and Tendencies in German Historiography on National Socialism and the 'Jewish Question'," in: Israel Gutman,Gideon Greif (ed.), ''The Historiography of the Holocaust Period'', Yad Vashem, Jerusalem 1988, pp. 1-51, 99-104, as well as their extension to the Historikerstreit dispute: "Singularity and its Relativization. Changing Views in German Historiography on National Socialism and the 'Final Solution',"; in: Yad Vashem Studies XIX (1988), pp. 151-186; as well as the publication of Kulka's exchange of letters with Ernst Nolte: "Der Umgang des Historikers Ernst Nolte mit Briefen aus Israel. Otto Dov Kulka... schlägt neues Kapitel im 'Historikerstreit' auf." In: Frankfurter Rundschau, 5. Nov. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; until the publication of Nicolas Berg's comprehensive book on the subject in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Berg, ''Der Holocaust und die westdeutschen Historiker'', Erforschung und Erinnerung, Wallstein Verl., Göttingen 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another study discusses the basic tendencies in Zionist historiography of the Jews under the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Dov Kulka, "Tendencies in Zionist Historiography on the Jews under the Nazi Regime", in: יוסף דעת''',''' מחקרים בהיסטוריה יהודית מודרנית מוגשים לפרופ' יוסף שלמון לחג יובלו, הוצאת הספרים של אוניברסיטת בן-גוריון בנגב, תש"ע, עמ' 25*-36*&lt;/ref&gt; His basic scholarly reviews on the historiography of the Holocaust period include extensive discussions devoted to two monumental two-volume works: [[Saul Friedländer]]'s ''Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Persecution, 1933-1939''; and ''[[The Years of Extermination|The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945]]'';&lt;ref&gt;In: ''Zion'', 66 (2001), pp. 109-123 [Hebr.].&lt;/ref&gt; and Ian Kershaw's biography of Hitler: ''Hitler 1889-1936. Hubris''; and ''Hitler 1936-1945. Nemesis''.&lt;ref&gt;In: ''Yad Vashem Studies'', 33 (2005), pp. 447-459.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies on Central European Jewry in the Twentieth Century===
Other studies by Kulka extend the exploration of the history of the Jews under the Nazi regime beyond Germany. These include: a joint project of the Hebrew University and the University of Vienna about Austria's Jewish citizens who found refuge from Nazi persecution in [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]], and their life in Israel;&lt;ref&gt;Erika Weinzierl and Otto Dov Kulka, Vertreibung und Neubeginn. Israelische Bürger österreichischer Herkunft, Wien 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; an article on Czech Jewry from the establishment of the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]], in 1918, until after the [[Munich Conference]] and the end of the Second Republic, in March 1939;&lt;ref&gt;The Munich Conference and the "Jewish Question" in Czechoslovakia in 1938, in: ''Yalkut Moreshet'', 2(1964), pp. 51-78 [Hebr.].&lt;/ref&gt; and a comparative study on the history of the Jews in Germany and Czechoslovakia between the two world wars and in the Holocaust period.&lt;ref&gt;"History and Historical Consciousness. Similarities and Dissimilarities in the History of the Jews in Germany and the Czech Lands 1918-1945," in: ''Bohemia'', 46/1 (2005), pp. 68-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all his studies of the Nazi period, Kulka refrained from dealing with the final stage of the physical annihilation of the Jews in the death camps and with the mass executions in the German-occupied areas of Eastern Europe. His only departure from this practice was an article based on his discovery of unknown documents on the "family camp" of Jews from the Theresienstadt Ghetto in Auschwitz-Birkenau and its place in the Nazis' policy of camouflage and deception about the deportation of the Jews to the "east" for extermination. The article was published in 1984 in Hebrew as "Ghetto in an Annihilation Camp. The 'Family Camp' of the Theresienstadt Jews in Auschwitz, 1943-1944,"&lt;ref&gt;בתוך: '''מחנות הריכוז הנאציים'''. מבנה ומגמות, דמות האסיר, היהודים במחנות, יד ושם, ירושלים תשמ"ד, עמ' 249 – 260, 271 - 280.&lt;/ref&gt; and simultaneously in an English-language version with a significant difference in the title: "Ghetto in an Annihilation Camp. Jewish Social History in the Holocaust Period and its Ultimate Limits."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Gutman and Avital Saf (eds.), ''The Nazi Concentration Camps. Structure and Aims. The Image of the Prisoner. The Jews in the Camps'', Yad Vashem, Jerusalem 1980, pp. 315-331, 352-356.&lt;/ref&gt; It deals, ''inter alia'', with the continuity of the patterns of life and the basic values of the Jewish society even in the very heart of the Auschwitz annihilation camp and in the face of a clear awareness of the certainty of death. The purpose of this special camp's existence and the reason for its liquidation – part of the policy of [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s Jewish section in the Reich Security Main Office – did not become clear until long after the war. The riddle was solved when Kulka discovered a secret exchange of correspondence between Eichmann and his staff and the German Red Cross in Berlin, and between the latter and the headquarters of the International Red Cross in Geneva. This almost unknown episode was thus accorded its rightful place in Holocaust historiography. The article was reprinted as an appendix to shed light on the historical background of Kulka's "extra-scientific" book, ''Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death''.

===Other Studies===
In 1982, Kulka initiated a large-scale international conference within the framework of his activity in the Historical Society of Israel and his research on the relations between Judaism and Christianity in the modern era. Its theme was "Judaism and Christianity under the impact of National-Socialism from 1919 to 1945, in Germany and in all the European countries occupied by the Third Reich, its allies and vassal states." The volume of the conference's proceedings, edited by Kulka and published in 1987 by the Historical Society of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;''Judaism and Christianity under the Impact of National Socialism 1919-1945'', The Historical Society of Israel, Jerusalem 1987; Review: Ian Kershaw, "The Churches and the Nazi Persecution of the Jews", in: ''Yad Vashem Studies'', Volume XIX (1988), pp. 427-437.&lt;/ref&gt; has become a reference point for research and discussion about this highly charged, complex issue.

Among Kulka's studies of other historical periods, a special place is occupied by his seminal Hebrew-language study on sixteenth century Jewish Prague in its Central European setting. Titled "The Historical Background of the National and Educational Teachings of MaHaRaL from Prague", it appeared in the jubilee volume of the periodical ''Zion''.&lt;ref&gt;''Zion'', 1985, pp. 320-277.&lt;/ref&gt; The subtitle in the English-language abstract encapsulates the article's thrust: "A Suggested New Approach to the Study of MaHaRaL."&lt;ref&gt;In the English abstract, ''Zion'', 1985, pp. XVII-XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; Kulka's point of departure is [[Maharal]]'s quasi-modern ideas, which had proved puzzling to many scholars. He too addresses the singularity of these ideas, reflected in the following quotation from Maharal's ''Netzach Yisrael'' concerning the substance of nations, their religious faith, and their place in creation:

"It is unworthy for a nation to be subjugated and yoked to another [nation], for the Holy One, blessed be He, created each and every nation unto itself. [...] For man chooses divinity which he will resemble in part. [...] Every nation chooses its divinity according to its own thoughts..."&lt;ref name="Netzach Israel 1955, p. 1"&gt;''Netzach Israel'', Tel Aviv 1955, Kap. 1, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
As for the Jewish people, its exile from its land and its redemption according to the same order of creation, Kulka continues to quote from Maharal with his unique style:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no doubt that the exile is a change and a departure from the order in which the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered each nation in its proper place and ordered Israel in their proper place, which is the Land of Israel. Exile from the place is a change and a complete departure, and all things, when they depart from their natural place [...] are unsustainable in the place that is not natural to them, until they return to their natural place. For if they were to remain in the place that is unnatural to them, what was unnatural to them would become natural, and this is something that is not possible, for the unnatural to become natural.&lt;ref name="Netzach Israel 1955, p. 1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his study, Kulka shed new light on the historical research into Maharal's ideas on nationhood and education, against a diverse background of sources and in the light of the contemporary political, social, and religious situation in Central Europe. According to Kulka it is inadequate to analyze Maharal's views only in the light of the writings of his Jewish contemporaries and predecessors. Insight about the distinctiveness of Maharal's ideas concerning nationhood and education, and the connection between them, could be gained by observing the historical setting in which he was active and examining possible influences to which he was susceptible in those specific circumstances. In his study of Maharal's national theory, Kulka thus probes the different channels through which Maharal was exposed to the distinctive fusion of religion and nationalism of post-Hussitic Bohemia in the Reformation era, not omitting national conflicts and the relations between the nations. Through the prism of this historical context, Kulka is able to address convincingly the singularity and originality of Maharal's creative Jewish thought and its relevance for his time.

Kulka applies a similar methodological approach in his inquiry into Maharal's innovative educational theory. One striking result of his research is the solution to the deeply puzzling similarities between Maharal's educational doctrine and that of the "teacher of nations", [[Jan Amos Comenius]], as set forth by Aharon Kleinberger.&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Kleinberger, ''The Educational Ideas of the Maharal of Prague'', Jerusalem 1962 [Hebr. with an English abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kleinberger, the fact that Comenius was just 17 when the Maharal died excludes the possibility that he influenced Maharal; and, ipso facto, the reverse influence is equally untenable. However, Kulka proves that Comenius, the last bishop of the humanistic Christian denomination of the [[Bohemian Brethren]] (in [[Latin]]: Unitas Fratrum), was the successor and codifier of the educational theories and methods of his teachers in this sect, who were Maharal's contemporaries and interlocutors.

This study concentrates initially on the twenty years of Maharal's tenure as "head of the [Jewish] communities of the State of Moravia," (אב בית דין וראש מדינת מעהרין) in close proximity to the educational center of the Bohemian Brethren. This center, with its superb Hebraists, translated and published the magnificent Czech-language edition of the Bible – Bible kralická. Some of Maharal's discussions and disputes with "Christian sages," which appear in his writings, took place in this milieu. Moreover, Kulka's approach, which sets Maharal within  the relevant historical context, is not inconsistent with an appreciation of his creative originality. Although anchored in the reality of their time, Maharal's ideas draw on far deeper sources and bear implications that far transcend this period.

These issues, including Kulka's study, were discussed extensively in an international conference about Maharal, held in Jerusalem in 2009 to mark the four hundredth anniversary of his death. The conference's sponsors – the Israel Academy of Sciences and the Humanities and the Historical Society of Israel – are to publish the proceedings.

===''Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death''===
Kulka's book, ''Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death. Reflections on Memory and Imagination'', was published almost simultaneously in various European languages and worldwide during 2013-14. It is fundamentally different from his scholarly works, as he attests in the introduction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I assume that readers of my historical publications will have identified me unequivocally with an attitude of strict and impersonally remote research, always conducted within well-defined historical categories, as a kind of self-contained method unto itself. But few are aware of the existence within me of a dimension of silence, of a choice I made to sever the biographical from the historical past. [...] The hidden meaning of the metaphoric language of the central, recurrent motifs in the book, such as 'immutable law of the death', the 'Great Death', the 'Metropolis of Death', reaches beyond the experience of the world of Auschwitz. They are metaphors for what at the time seemed to expand into a world order that would change the course of human history and remained so in my reflective memory. I am also aware that these texts, though anchored in concrete historical events, transcend the sphere of history.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book was extensively discussed in the press and the electronic media in Israel  and throughout the world, particularly in England, France, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''Die Zeit'', 14.03.13; ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 26.03.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Most reviewers commented on its different style of language and observation amid the rich literature of the Holocaust period, and remarked on its special place alongside the autobiographical works of [[Saul Friedländer]], [[Primo Levi]], and [[Imre Kertész]]. Writing in the British ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper, [[Thomas W. Laqueur]] noted, "Primo Levi's testimony, it is often said, is that of a chemist: clear, cool, precise, distant. So with Kulka's work: this is the product of a master historian – ironic, probing, present in the past, able to connect the particular with the cosmic."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas W. Laqueur [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/25/landscapes-metropolis-death-kulka-review "Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death by Otto Dov Kulka – review"], ''The Guardian'', 25 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; And, in ''[[Le Monde]]'', Nicolas Weill wrote, "A book that defies categorization in any conventional genre. [...] The lucidity and temperance that accompany this stunning return to the past arouse amazement and astonishment."&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', 25 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
The book received two prestigious literary awards in Germany and Britain: The Geschwister-Scholl Prize and the Jewish Quarterly Literary Wingate Prize.

[[Czech Republic|Czech]] historian Anna Hájková of [[University of Warwick]] criticized Kulka's book ''Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death: Reflections on Memory and Imagination'' for omitting his father and sister who died in Treblinka death camp.&lt;ref name="hajkova"&gt;{{cite news

'''Philipp Jaffé''' (February 17, 1819 – April 3, 1870) was a German historian and philologist. The [[Schwersenz]] (then [[Prussia]]) native, despite discrimination against his Jewish religion, was one of the most important German [[medievalist]]s of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="SchwartzJaffee"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Daniel|title=Between Two Worlds, Belonging to Neither|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/219206/philipp-jaffe-between-two-worlds|accessdate=7 December 2016|publisher=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography and career==
After graduating from the gymnasium at [[Poznań|Posen]] in 1838 he went to [[Berlin]], entering a banking-house. Two years later he abandoned commercial life and studied at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] (Ph.D. 1844). Seven years later appeared his great work, ''[[Regesta]] Pontificum Romanorum ab Condita Ecclesia ad Annum p. Ch. n. 1198'', containing 11,000 papal documents, (Berlin, 1851. 2nd ed. by [[Samuel Löwenfeld|Löwenfeld]], [[Ferdinand Kaltenbrunner|Kaltenbrunner]], and [[Paul Ewald (historian)|Ewald]]. Leipzig, 1885–88). This work made him well known, but he had still to earn a livelihood; he therefore again entered the university, this time as a student of medicine, at Berlin and later at [[Vienna]]. Graduating as [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from Berlin in 1853, he engaged in practise in that city for a year, and then became one of the editors of the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]].'' This position he resigned in 1863, his chief work having been vols. xii, xvi, xvii, xviii, xix, and xx of the ''Scriptores''.

In 1862 Jaffé was appointed assistant professor of history at Humboldt University of Berlin, where he lectured on [[Latin language|Latin]] [[paleography]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and medieval [[chronology]]. In 1868 he became a [[Christian]]. During the last year of his life he suffered from ''[[delirium]] persecutionis.''

Jaffé wrote, in addition to the above-mentioned works, ''Geschichte des Deutschen Reiches unter Lothar dem Sachsen,'' Berlin, 1843; ''Geschichte des Deutschen Reiches unter Konrad III.'' Hanover, 1845; and ''Bibliotheca Rerum Germanicarum,'' ib. 1864-71. The latter series contained editions of the correspondence and ''vitae'' of [[Saint Boniface]]; his edition of the [[Boniface correspondence]] was praised as the first critical edition of the letters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rev. of ''Bibliotheca rerum Germanicarum edidit Philippus Jaffe''|journal=[[Historische Zeitschrift]]|date=1866|volume=16|issue=2|pages=423–27|url=http://www.jtor.org/stabe/275909383}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formed the basis for subsequent translations and editions of the letters, including that by [[Georg Pfahler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfahler|first1=Georg|title=Die bonifatianische Briefsammlung: chronologisch geordnet und nach ihrem wesentlichen Inhalt mitgetheilt|date=1882|publisher=M. Schell|location=Heilbronn|pages=vii-viii|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100436661}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaffé furthermore collaborated with [[Wilhelm Wattenbach]] in editing the ''Ecclesiæ Metropolitanæ Coloniensis Codices,'' which was published (Berlin, 1879) by Wattenbach after Jaffé's death. Jaffé committed suicide at [[Wittenberge]] on April 3, 1870.

'''Sølvi Sogner''' (15 March 1932 – 23 March 2017) was a Norwegian  historian. She was a professor at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1988 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/wiki/S%C3%B8lvi_Sogner|title= Sølvi Sogner|publisher =    lokalhistoriewiki.no  |accessdate= March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Sogner was born in [[Trondheim]], Norway. She was the daughter of Trygve Bauge  (1896-1978) and  Sidsel Schulz (1904–97). In 1959, she married fellow historian Bjørn Sogner (1930–1985).

From 1957-1964, she was a scientific assistant at the [[Norwegian Institute of Local History]] (''Norsk lokalhistorisk institutt''). Sogner became university lecturer in 1975 and [[dr.philos.]] in 1976. She became an associate professor at the University of Oslo in 1974  and a professor from 1988. She was a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Sciences]] from 1994 and  head of the International Commission for Historical Demographic Research (ICHD). She was a board member of the Norwegian Institute of Local History (1978-1981) and chairman (1982-1993).&lt;ref name="snl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/wiki/Norsk_lokalhistorisk_institutt|title= Norsk lokalhistorisk institutt |publisher =    lokalhistoriewiki.no   |accessdate= March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of her research dealt with the subject of demographics. Among her publications were [https://www.nb.no/nbsok/nb/9be743a4bb4f4a3deb3e1f8e628c32c5?index=9 ''Ung i Europa. Norsk ungdom over Nordsjøen til Nederland i tidlig nytid''] (1994) and [https://www.nb.no/nbsok/nb/8a789caadb75072d22772358d86524ab?index=14 ''Og skuta lå i Amsterdam-: et glemt norsk innvandrersamfunn i Amsterdam 1621-1720''] (2012) in which she researched 17th century Norwegian immigration to [[Amsterdam]] and to the [[Netherlands]]. She wrote about the period 1500&amp;ndash;1750 in ''Cappelens kvinnehistorie'' (1992), and volume 6 ("Krig og fred 1660–1780") in ''Aschehougs Norgeshistorie'' (1996).

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|2.0|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.

==History==
According to the ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'', Tatums was founded in [[Indian Territory]] in 1895 by Lee and Mary Tatum, though ''Oklahoma Place Names'' states that the town was not incorporated until May 9, 1896.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"&gt;O'Dell, Larry. [http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entryname=TATUMS "Tatums,"] ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'', Oklahoma Historical Society, Accessed May 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OK-Place-Names"&gt;Shirk, George H. ''Oklahoma Place Names'', Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, 1965, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt; The town was one of more than fifty all-black towns founded in Oklahoma, and it is one of thirteen still in existence.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"/&gt; Lee Tatum was the first postmaster, ran a grocery store, and was a U.S. Marshal.&lt;ref name="OK-Place-Names"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"/&gt; Travelers who came through Tatums could stay at the home of Henry Taylor, who owned the largest home in town.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"/&gt; Over the next few decades, other businesses were added to the town, including a church, school, hotel, blacksmith shop, a cotton gin and sawmill, and a motor garage.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"/&gt; The [[Bethel Missionary Baptist Church]], which was completed in 1919, is on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Carter County, Oklahoma|National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"/&gt; In the 1920s, oil wells were drilled around Tatums, and several residents richly profited from them.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"/&gt;

A brick school funded by the [[Rosenwald Fund]] was completed in 1926.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"/&gt; In 1927, [[Norman Studios]] filmed a silent movie, ''Black Gold'', in Tatums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129789/ | title=Black Gold (1928) | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshal L. B. Tatums played a role in the film.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"/&gt; No copy of the film is known to exist, but the script and camera are held by the [[Autry National Center]] in California.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"/&gt;

The Great Depression greatly hurt Tatums' economy, so many residents migrated to urban areas.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"/&gt; Amid the Depression, the [[Works Progress Administration]] built a new brick school in 1936.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Tatums"/&gt;

'''Tore Linné Eriksen''' (born 2 May 1945) is a Norwegian historian. His fields of study include [[global history]], [[development studies]] and [[African history]], especially focusing on [[Southern Africa]].

==Early life and career==
Linné Eriksen hails from [[Kolbotn]], but enrolled at the [[Oslo katedralskole|Oslo Cathedral School]] in 1961 to take his secondary education. Attending the same school were later academics and politicians [[Knut Kjeldstadli]], [[Steinar Stjernø]], [[Helge Rønning]] and [[Theo Koritzinsky]]. Here, Linné Eriksen was among the founders of [[Operasjon Dagsverk]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=klk&gt;{{cite news|title=En underlig boksprengt en|last=Sjøli|first=Hans Petter|date=24 January 2004|work=Klassekampen|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing school, he briefly worked as a teacher in Northern Norway. He was later employed in the publishing house [[Pax forlag]], founded in 1964, and made his literary debut there in 1966. He then enrolled at the [[University of Oslo]], and was chairman of the [[Norwegian Students' Society]] in 1968. Among the radical students, Linné Eriksen was preceded and succeeded by two conservatives; [[Georg Apenes]] and [[Halvor Stenstadvold]] respectively. Originally a member of the Socialist Youth League (SUF), together with some of the later founders of the [[Workers' Communist Party (Norway)|Workers' Communist Party]], Linné Eriksen was excluded in 1969.&lt;ref name=klk/&gt; He later became involved in the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]].&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt; In May 2011 he left the Socialist Left Party due to its support for the Norwegian participation in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan war]], and its environmental and development policies.&lt;ref name="kk-utmelding"&gt; [http://klassekampen.no/58871/article/item/null/melder-seg-ut-i-protest Klassekampen: Melder seg ut i protest]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Linné Eriksen finally graduated from the [[University of Trondheim]] with a [[cand.philol.]] degree in 1974. From 1981 he was employed as a researcher at the [[Norwegian Institute of International Affairs]]. In 1997 he was hired as [[associate professor]] at [[Oslo University College]],&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Eriksen, Tore Linné |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location= |url=http://www.snl.no/article.html?id=532180 |accessdate=11 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; being promoted to professor in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hio.no/content/view/full/55443|title=HiO presenterer egne forfattere|date=7 February 2007|publisher=Oslo University College|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now retired, but continues his research and writing. 

Notable publications include the 1974 book ''Underutvikling''. In 1985 he published both ''David Livingstone'' and ''The Political Economy of [[Namibia]]''. ''Den vanskelige bistanden'' followed in 1987, about [[development aid]]. In 1993 he won the [[Brage Prize]] for the school textbooks in modern history, ''Norge og verden fra 1850 til 1940'' and ''Norge og verden etter 1940''.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

After 2000, his interest has shifted somewhat towards the history of [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lær av historien|last=Sæbø|first=Maren|date=2 May 2005|work=Klassekampen|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has, however, not discontinued his [[African studies]]. The 2000 ''Norway and National Liberation in Southern Africa''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/show?pid=000580546&amp;kid=biblio Entry] in [[BIBSYS]]. Retrieved on 11 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by a 2002 book on [[Nelson Mandela]], which received a prize from the [[Norwegian Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name=ntb&gt;{{cite news|title=60 år 2. mai: Førsteamanuensis Tore Linné Eriksen|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=12 April 2005|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he published the book ''Det første folkemordet i det tjuende århundret: Namibia 1903-1908'' on the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]], considered the first of many [[genocide]]s in the 20th century. In 2008 he contributed to ''Folkemordenes svarte bok'', an anthology on genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Et forvarsel om holocaust|last=Nærland|first=Mina Hauge|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/magasinet/2008/03/11/529422.html|date=11 March 2008|work=Dagbladet|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Socialist Left Party, Linné Eriksen has been involved in [[Nei til EU]] and the [[Norwegian Council for Africa]], and has been a member of the board of the [[Development Fund]].&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt; Linné Eriksen lives at [[Huseby]] in Oslo, with his wife Agnete Eriksen. &lt;ref name=klk/&gt;
